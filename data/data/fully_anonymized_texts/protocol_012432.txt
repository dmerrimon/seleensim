Background and Objective: Acyl-ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide that stimulates appetite and 
food intake. It is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS- 
R1a). Preclinical studies suggest that acyl-ghrelin increases alcohol intake and decreases in acyl- 
ghrelin and GHS-R1a function suppresses alcohol consumption. Furthermore, previous human 
studies indicate a positive correlation between endogenous ghrelin levels and alcohol craving and 
drinking. In clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_304065], intravenous (IV) 
acyl-ghrelin administration, versus placebo 1) increased alcohol craving during alcohol cue- 
exposure and 2) increased IV alcohol self-administration as well as decreased latency to first 
infusion of alcohol and 3) increased brain activation in the amygdala in anticipation of alcohol 
reward. Together, this preclinical and human data suggest that manipulating the ghrelin signal 
may be a novel and potentially effective pharmacological approach to treat individuals with 
alcohol use disorder.
After the discoveries of GHS-R1a and acyl-ghrelin, a next step was identifying ghrelin O- 
acyltransferase (GOAT) the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of des-acyl-ghrelin (DAG) to 
acyl-ghrelin via octanoylation. GOAT is thus “the master switch for the ghrelin system”, as acyl- 
ghrelin , not DAG, is biologically active at the GHSR-1a. GOAT’s structure is highly conserved, is 
produced by [CONTACT_304066]-expressed with ghrelin. Therefore, GOAT is 
a promising target for manipulating the ghrelin system by [CONTACT_304067]-to-total 
ghrelin ratio (where total ghrelin = acyl-ghrelin + DAG). Recently, the ghrelin system has been 
investigated as a potential treatment target for AUDs. As such, an oral bioavailable GOAT 
inhibitor offers encouraging potential as a treatment for alcohol use disorder. GLWL-[ADDRESS_371951] a proof-of-concept 
human laboratory study to assess a potential early signal of efficacy of GLWL-01 in relation to 
alcohol-related outcomes.
Study population: Males and females (N = 43) with alcohol use disorder.
Study Design: A within-subject, counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
Participants will take GLWL-01 450 mg b.i.d. or matched placebo for a minimum of 4 days (Stage 
I). After a minimum [ADDRESS_371952] during which the 
counterbalanced study drug will be administered for a minimum of 4 days.
Primary outcome measure: The co-primary aims will be to determine whether: 1) the number of 
adverse events (AEs) experienced differ in the GLWL-01 condition, compared to placebo; and 2) 
GLWL-01, compared to placebo, reduces alcohol cue-elicited craving using a validated alcohol 
cue-reactivity procedure.
Secondary outcome measures: The main secondary aim will be the effects of GLWL-01 on food 
choices using a “virtual buffet” experimental procedure. We will also monitor a wide range of

Page 5 of 483 BACKGROUND
3.1 Statement of the problem: searching for new neuropharmacological targets in alcohol use 
disorder
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disease that results in severe 
consequences including serious morbidity and mortality (NIAAA,2018). According to recent data, 
approximately 30% of the US adult population meets criteria for lifetime diagnosis of AUD (Grant 
et al., 2015; Miller & Cohen, 2001). Treatment of AUD consists of psychological, social and 
pharmacologic interventions (Garbutt, West, Carey, Lohr, & Crews, 1999). When combined with 
psychosocial treatments, medications can improve outcomes for some individuals; however, 
these treatments are not effective for many others (Edwards, Kenna, Swift, & Leggio, 2011; Heilig 
& Egli, 2006). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved disulfiram, naltrexone 
and acamprosate for AUD, and all these medications have limited efficacy (Edwards et al., 2011; 
Heilig & Egli, 2006). Developi[INVESTIGATOR_304046] a high scientific and public health 
priority. There is a crucial need to identify novel drug targets that may lead to the discovery of 
new effective medications for AUD. One source of new drug targets comes from research on the 
neurobiology of obesity, as alcohol- and food-seeking behaviors share some overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_304047] (Tomasi & Volkow, 2013). While alcoholism, obesity and binge eating are 
complex conditions with likely diverse genetic and environmental contributions to their etiologies 
(Tomasi & Volkow, 2013), it is notable that medications used to treat AUD often result in weight 
loss. For example, naltrexone, topi[INVESTIGATOR_304048]/or eating disorders (Leggio et al., 2011). Therefore, 
research focused on identifying feeding-related pathways may be of utility in understanding the 
neurobiology of alcoholism, and may yield possible neuropharmacological targets for AUD. As 
outlined below, there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the notion that the ghrelin 
system may be a novel neuropharmacological target for AUD.
3.2 What is ghrelin and what does it do?
Ghrelin was first isolated from the stomach (Kojima et al., 1999). It is a 28-amino acid peptide 
acting as the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1a), a G- 
protein coupled receptor that induces growth hormone (GH) release from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] (Kojima et 
al., 1999). The n-octanoyl bearing ghrelin is known as active ghrelin (acylated), although the des- 
acylated ghrelin is not totally inactive (Stengel & Taché, 2009). The acylation process is facilitated 
by [CONTACT_304068] O-acyltransferase (GOAT) the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of des-acyl-ghrelin 
(DAG) to acyl-ghrelin via octanoylation. Ghrelin activates hypothalamic orexigenic neurons and 
inhibits anorectic neurons to induce hunger (Solomon, De Fanti, & Martínez, 2005; Toshinai et al., 
2003); accordingly, intracranial ghrelin administration stimulates feeding in mammals (Cowley et 
al., 2003; Tschöp, Smiley, & Heiman, 2000) and non-mammals (Furuse et al., 2001; Unniappan et 
al., 2002). In humans, intravenous (IV) ghrelin administration increases appetite and food intake 
(Akamizu et al., 2008; Druce et al., 2005; Neary et al., 2004). Ghrelin stimulates appetite and food 
intake by [CONTACT_304069] (ARC), an area known for its role in alcohol reinforcement

Page 6 of 48via opi[INVESTIGATOR_304049] (Loose, Ronnekleiv, & Kelly, 1991). The highest expression of GHS-R1a’s is 
in the central nervous system (CNS). GHS-R1a is also expressed in several peripheral tissues such 
as the stomach, intestine, pancreas, thyroid, gonads, adrenal, kidney, heart and vasculature. It is 
unclear how circulating ghrelin reaches CNS targets. It may do so by [CONTACT_304070]-brain 
barrier (BBB) or by [CONTACT_304071] (or passage) as the BBB is incomplete at the ARC (Chollet, 
Meyer, & Beck-Sickinger, 2009). Local CNS regulation may occur as small quantities of ghrelin are 
produced in the hypothalamus and thus, may also regulate neurons expressing GHS-R1a’s 
(Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_105406]., 2002).
3.3 Rationale for studying the ghrelin system in alcohol use disorder
In addition to the ARC, GHS-R1a’s are also highly co-expressed with dopamine (DA) receptors in 
other brain regions (e.g., dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, midbrain, substantia nigra, raphe 
nuclei and ventral tegmental area [VTA]) (Guan et al., 1997; Jiang, Betancourt, & Smith, 2006; 
Katayama, Nogami, Nishiyama, Kawase, & Kawamura, 2000; Zigman, Jones, Lee, Saper, & 
Elmquist, 2006). Feeding behavior, DA release and locomotor activity are triggered by [CONTACT_304072] (ICV) infusion as well as peripheral ghrelin administration (Jerlhag, 
Grøtli, Luthman, Svensson, & Engel, 2006; Kawahara et al., 2009; Naleid et al., 2005; Quarta et al., 
2009). 6-Hydroxydopamine lesions of the VTA suppress ghrelin's ability to elicit food-reinforced 
behavior (Weinberg, Nicholson, & Currie, 2011). Alcohol- and food-seeking behaviors share 
common neurobiological mechanisms, and both alcohol and food exert their reinforcing effects, 
in part, by [CONTACT_288432] (reviewed in: ((Leggio et al., 2011); (Tomasi & Volkow, 
2013)). Cortico-mesolimbic DA pathways may mediate alcohol’s rewarding effects (including 
craving) associated with its abuse liability (reviewed in: (Koob, 1992; Tupala & Tiihonen, 2004)) 
Thus, involvement of ghrelin in the DA reward system and the role of the DA reward system in 
AUD suggest a significant role of ghrelin in the pathophysiology of AUD, as detailed in the animal 
and human studies summarized below.
3.4 Animal studies:
Ghrelin modulates cholinergic and dopaminergic reward pathways
Ghrelin administration into the VTA increases extracellular concentrations of accumbal DA in mice 
(Jerlhag et al., 2007). Peripheral administration of ghrelin or direct administration into the intra- 
laterodorsal tegmental area (LDTg) concomitantly increases release of ventral tegmental 
acetylcholine and accumbal DA in rats (Jerlhag, Janson, Waters, & Engel, 2012). The non-selective 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine attenuates the stimulatory 
and DA-enhancing effects of ghrelin infused into the third ventricle (Jerlhag et al., 2006), 
indicating that nAChRs mediates these neurochemical properties of ghrelin; nAChRs also mediate 
the locomotor stimulatory and DA-enhancing properties of ghrelin administered into the VTA 
(Jerlhag, 2008). Only alpha3-beta2, beta3, and/or alpha6 nAChR subtypes are implicated in the 
central alcohol rewarding actions of ghrelin (Jerlhag, 2008). The same nAchRs (alpha3-beta2, 
beta3, and/or alpha6) in the VTA mediate the rewarding properties of alcohol, modulating 
voluntary-ethanol-consumption induced increases in both VTA acetylcholine and accumbal DA

Page 7 of 48levels (Larsson, Edström, Svensson, Söderpalm, & Engel, 2005; Larsson, Jerlhag, Svensson, 
Söderpalm, & Engel, 2004). Peripherally injected ghrelin also activates reward-related measures, 
such as locomotor activity, accumbal-DA release and conditioned place preference (CPP), an 
established measure of alcohol reward where mice are conditioned to associate an environment 
with previous alcohol exposure in the absence of alcohol itself (Jerlhag, 2008). In summary, these 
studies demonstrate that both ghrelin and ethanol share a common substrate, the cholinergic- 
dopaminergic reward system, for their reward processing properties.
Ghrelin is required for alcohol reward
Another set of experiments demonstrated that ICV ghrelin administration to mice significantly 
increased alcohol intake compared to vehicle treatment in a 2-bottle (alcohol/water) free choice 
limited access paradigm, and this increase was even more robust when ghrelin was administered 
bilaterally into either the VTA or the LDTg (Jerlhag et al., 2009). The effects of ghrelin on the VTA 
and LDTg were specific for alcohol intake (i.e., food intake was increased by [CONTACT_304073]). Notably, ghrelin administration into the lateral hypothalamus or paraventricular 
nucleus had no effects on ethanol intake (Schneider, Rada, Darby, Leibowitz, & Hoebel, 2007), 
confirming that ghrelin works in specific brain reward nodes (i.e., VTA). Furthermore, the effects 
of ICV ghrelin on alcohol intake were absent in GHSR knockout mice (Jerlhag et al., 2009).
Additional experiments reported that the rewarding properties of alcohol (i.e., alcohol-induced 
accumbal DA release and locomotor stimulation) are also attenuated in ghrelin receptor knockout 
mice compared to wild type (Jerlhag, Landgren, Egecioglu, Dickson, & Engel, 2011), suggesting 
that the relationship between ghrelin and alcohol reward is primarily mediated through the
GHSR-1a’s. In summary, these studies demonstrate that central ghrelin signaling is required for 
alcohol reward.
Specificity of Ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) antagonism for reduction of alcohol reward and 
consumption .
Apart from energy homeostasis, gut peptides communicate with pathways involved in the 
rewarding effects of food (Perello & Dickson, 2014). Ghrelin administration increases the activity 
of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and DA release in the nucleus 
accumbens (NAc) (Abizaid et al., 2006) , suggesting that ghrelin affects motivation and reward 
processing (Perello & Dickson, 2014). 6-Hydroxydopamine lesions of the VTA suppress ghrelin's 
ability to elicit food-reinforced behavior(Weinberg et al., 2011). Consistent with the commonality 
of pathways regulating motivation for food and alcohol (Volkow, Wang, Tomasi, & Baler, 2013), 
independent labs using different animal models have provided evidence for a role of ghrelin in 
alcohol-seeking behaviors. Briefly, central or peripheral ghrelin administration increases NAc DA 
overflow and alcohol reward measured by [CONTACT_304074] (CPP) (Jerlhag, 2008; 
Jerlhag et al., 2011; Jerlhag et al., 2009). Ventricular, VTA, or dorsolateral tegmental area 
injections of ghrelin increase alcohol intake (Jerlhag et al., 2009). Alcohol intake, NAc DA release, 
and alcohol-induced CPP are abolished in ghrelin peptide or receptor knock-out mice (Bahi et al., 
2013; Jerlhag et al., 2011; Jerlhag et al., 2009) Furthermore, in mice, rats or prairie voles, GHS-R1a

Page 8 of 48antagonism reduces NAc DA release, alcohol CPP, as well as alcohol intake, preference and 
operant self-administration (Cepko et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2012; Gomez & Ryabinin, 2014; 
Jerlhag, Egecioglu, Dickson, Svensson, & Engel, 2008; Kaur & Ryabinin, 2010; Landgren et al., 
2012; Stevenson et al., 2015; Suchankova et al., 2013; Suchankova, Engel, & Jerlhag, 2016; Szulc 
et al., 2013). These effects do not appear to be due to the caloric content of alcohol as GHS-R1a 
antagonism also reduces: 1) intake of saccharin (a non-caloric sweetener with high reward value) 
in mice and rats (Landgren et al., 2011); 2) CPP, where reward is measured alcohol-free (Jerlhag, 
2008; Jerlhag et al., 2011; Jerlhag et al., 2009); and 3) the rewarding effects of other addictive 
drugs which have no caloric content (e.g., cocaine and nicotine)(Engel & Jerlhag, 2014). Finally, 
we have recently shown that GHS knock-out rats self-administer less alcohol in a short-term 
binge-like drinking paradigm (Zallar et al., Under Review)
GHS-R1a antagonism inhibits both evoked and spontaneous GABAergic activity in the central 
nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)
Cruz and colleagues (2013) used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to 
demonstrate the presence of GHS-R mRNA in the CeA (an area with a key role in regulating 
ethanol consumption whose GABAergic transmission is enhanced by [CONTACT_304075]) and used electrophysiological methods to demonstrate tonic ghrelin signaling in 
the CeA (Cruz, Herman, Cote, Ryabinin, & Roberto, 2013). In naïve animals, superfusion of ghrelin 
increased the amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and the frequency of 
miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs); co-application of ethanol further increased 
the ghrelin-induced enhancement of IPSP amplitude. In chronic ethanol-treated animals, 
superfusion of the GHS-R1a antagonists D-Lys3-GHRP-[ADDRESS_371955] on both evoked and spontaneous 
GABAergic activity, suggesting constitutive activation of GHS-R1a’s or tonic activity of endogenous 
ghrelin signaling in rat CeA. Pretreatment of CeA neurons with the GHS-R1a antagonists 
completely blocked the ghrelin-induced facilitation of IPSP amplitudes, indicating that ghrelin 
exerts its effect through GHS-R1a’s. These results suggest that the ghrelin system may constitute 
part of a brain pathway modulating reinforcement properties of alcohol consumption, and 
provide additional evidence for the potential role of ghrelin receptor antagonism as a novel 
pharmacological approach to treat AUD.
3.5 Human studies:
Blood ghrelin levels, alcohol intake and craving
In healthy volunteers, blood ghrelin levels are significantly reduced after acute alcohol 
consumption (Calissendorff, Danielsson, Brismar, & Röjdmark, 2005, 2006; Calissendorff, 
Gustafsson, Holst, Brismar, & Röjdmark, 2012; Zimmermann, Buchmann, Steffin, Dieterle, & Uhr, 
2007). Additional studies reported that non-abstinent alcoholics had lower blood ghrelin 
concentration compared to controls (Addolorato et al., 2006; Badaoui et al., 2008; de Timary et 
al., 2012), and abstinent alcoholics had increased levels (D. J. Kim et al., 2005; J. H. Kim et al.,
PI [CONTACT_5627]: Lorenzo Leggio, M.D., Ph.D., M.Sc.
Abbreviated Title: GOAT
Version Date: 09/25/2023 
Page 9 of 482013; Kraus et al., 2005). Together, these studies suggest that ghrelin levels are suppressed by 
[CONTACT_304076]. The PI, [CONTACT_59890], conducted a study 
that provided the first preliminary evidence of a significant positive correlation between blood 
ghrelin levels and the Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) craving scores in active 
drinking alcoholic individuals (Addolorato et al., 2006), a finding also confirmed by [CONTACT_304077] (Koopmann & von der Goltz et al., 2012) . Other studies partially confirmed the 
relationship between blood ghrelin levels and alcohol craving in alcoholic individuals, albeit only 
in those with positive family history of alcoholism (Hillemacher et al., 2007) or in females (Wurst 
et al., 2007). [CONTACT_59890] led the first longitudinal study of serum ghrelin levels in alcoholic patients 
over the course of 12 weeks treatment. Ghrelin concentrations were assessed at baseline (T0; 
after 72 hours abstinence), then repeatedly at 2 weeks (T1), 6 weeks (T2), and 12 weeks (T3); 
levels in abstinent patients were compared to those who did not remain abstinent during the 12- 
week treatment period. At baseline, blood ghrelin levels were significantly higher in the non- 
abstinent group (p=0.035) and there was a significant group x time interaction effect on ghrelin 
levels (F=4.193, df=3, p=0.012), [Figure 1]. These findings suggest that ghrelin level in early 
abstinence predicts later relapse. We also found a significant positive correlation between 
baseline ghrelin levels and craving during the 12-week period (Leggio et al., 2012). In summary, 
consistent with the preclinical data, human studies show that higher ghrelin levels may be 
associated with higher craving and alcohol consumption, suggesting that ghrelin is a potential 
new pharmacological target for AUD. Moreover, a recent PET study (although in a different 
population of obese subjects) showing that peripheral ghrelin levels were inversely associated 
with the availability of DA type 2 receptor (D2R) in key reward processing areas such as the 
caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, amygdala, and temporal lobes, i.e., higher ghrelin levels 
were associated with lower D2R availability, presumably from increased DA release and receptor 
occupancy (Dunn et al., 2012). Notably, although only peripheral ghrelin levels were tested, 
circulating ghrelin may reach CNS targets directly by [CONTACT_304078] (Chollet et al., 2009). Taken 
together, these results support the hypothesis that ghrelin may influence alcohol craving and 
consumption via the DA-related rewarding processing.

Version Date: 09/25/[ADDRESS_371956] study administering IV ghrelin to alcoholic individuals (PI:[INVESTIGATOR_288390]). In this double- 
blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject, randomized study, 45 non-treatment seeking heavy drinking 
alcoholic individuals received a bolus of IV ghrelin 1 μg /kg, IV ghrelin 3 μg/kg or saline solution (placebo) 
and then immediately participated in a cue-reactivity (CR) experiment in a controlled laboratory setting. 
During the CR procedure, participants were exposed to alcohol cues (e.g., the sight and smell of one’s 
preferred alcoholic beverage), compared to control cues (while water is usually used in CR studies, juice 
cues were used in this study to specifically control for non-alcoholic appetitive behaviors). Both subjective 
(i.e., urge to drink and attention to the cues) and physiological (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, salivation) 
responses to cues were collected. The main results of this study (Leggio et al., 2014) showed a main 
ghrelin effect in increasing the urge to drink alcohol [F(2,40) = 3.36, p = .045] using a repeated measures 
ANCOVA (Figure 2). Post-hoc comparisons revealed that alcohol urge was significantly greater for ghrelin 
in 3 mcg/kg than placebo (p = .046) (Figure 2), with a large effect size (d = 0.94). No statistically significant 
differences were found neither in the ghrelin 1 mcg/kg vs. placebo condition nor between ghrelin 1 
mcg/kg and ghrelin 3 mcg/kg. In contrast with urge to drink alcohol, IV ghrelin was not significantly more 
effective than placebo in increasing urge to drink juice.

Figure 2. Intravenous ghrelin 3 mcg/kg administration, compared to placebo, 
resulted in increased urge to drink alcohol, measured as change in an Alcohol- 
Visual Analogue Scale (dA-VAS) during a human laboratory study with alcoholic 
individuals. There was a main ghrelin effect in increasing the urge to drink alcohol 
[F(2,40) = 3.36, p = .045] using a repeated measures ANCOVA. Post-hoc 
comparisons revealed that alcohol urge was significantly greater for ghrelin 3 
mcg/kg than placebo (p = .046), with a large effect size (d = 0.94).
Post-infusion serum total ghrelin level was correlated with the increase in alcohol urge during both the 
first and the second alcohol trials. Similarly, the maximum serum ghrelin peak level across the six 
measurements correlated with the increase in alcohol urge during both the first and second alcohol trials. 
By [CONTACT_22242], neither urge to drink juice nor food craving questionnaire scores were significantly correlated 
with serum ghrelin levels.
Albeit preliminary, these data have clinical implications given that craving is a predictor of alcohol use. 
Craving has been proposed as a clinically relevant endophenotype, as higher craving is associated with an 
increased rate of relapse (Bottlender & Soyka, 2004; Marlatt, 1978; Rohsenow et al., 2001). Furthermore, 
the CR procedure is well-validated (Leggio, Schwandt, Oot, Dias, & Ramchandani, 2013; Monti, Rohsenow, 
& Hutchison, 2000) Exposure to alcohol cues can simulate a high-risk situation for relapse and urge to 
drink, as assessed in the CR, and predict drinking after treatment (Monti et al., 2000). Notably, 
medications (e.g., naltrexone) that reduce alcohol consumption also reduce alcohol craving during the CR 
procedure (Monti et al., 2000; Swift, 1999).
Human acyl-ghrelin administered intravenously acutely increases alcohol self-administration and 
modulates brain activity in alcohol-dependent heavy drinkers
In this second human laboratory study (13-AA-0043; PI [INVESTIGATOR_288390]), we hypothesized that IV ghrelin increases 
intravenous alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA). We further hypothesized that it modulates neural 
activity in central pathways related to alcohol- and food-seeking behaviors. We conducted two 
experiments: 1) IV-ASA and 2) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each experiment consisted 
of two identical visits with crossover, counterbalanced, randomized, double-blind administration of IV 
placebo or acyl-ghrelin.
IV-ASA: The primary outcome was the number of self-administered alcohol infusions. Participants self- 
administered a significantly higher number of alcohol infusions under IV ghrelin compared to placebo

model: F1,80 = 4.86, p = 0.05] ( Figure 3). The effect size of IV ghrelin in increasing ASA was robust 
(Cohen’s dz = 0.74). We also found that, participants initiated button pressing sooner (F1,8 = 9.71, p = 
0.01), receiving their first infusion earlier (F1,8 = 6.18, p = 0.03) under ghrelin compared to placebo 
(Farokhnia E Grodin MR Lee et al ....and L Leggio). Consistent with preclinical experiments, ghrelin
administration increased alcohol intake in AUD heavy drinkers, providing the first evidence in humans for 
a role of ghrelin in ASA. Notably, we used a progressive ratio procedure, which is commonly used in 
animal models and provides translational evidence on the role of ghrelin in humans in increasing 
motivation for alcohol reward.
Figure 3 IV ghrelin versus placebo significantly increases the total number of alcohol infusions self- 
administered during the IV-ASA (p ≤ 0.05). Each line represents a participant and the circles indicate the 
number of alcohol infusions (some circles overlap because multiple participants administered the same 
number of infusions during the session; there were missing data for one participant in the placebo 
condition).
fMRI: We used the Alcohol-Food Incentive Delay (AFID) task, which was developed at NIAAA (Vatsalya et 
al., 2015) as a modified version of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task. The MID task, also developed 
at NIAAA (Knutson, Westdorp, Kaiser, & Hommer, 2000), is a widely used validated task to investigate 
anticipatory reward 60. During the task, participants respond for alcohol, food, or neutral cues to earn 
points for alcohol (at the end, while still in the scanner, an IV alcohol clamp is administered to rise BrAC to 
0.08 mg/dL), food (at the end of the session, participants receive snacks), or no reward. Using a 
counterbalanced, within-subject, Drug (Ghrelin, Placebo) x Cue type (Alcohol, Food, Neutral) design, we 
tested whether IV ghrelin affects BOLD activation in response to viewing an alcohol or food cue symbol 
signaling the receipt of a reward, i.e., anticipation of food and alcohol reward. To control for between- 
subject differences, participants performed a baseline (pre-administration of ghrelin/placebo) AFID task.

Page 13 of 48Then, the task was run after IV ghrelin or placebo administration (AFID-1). The task was repeated under IV 
alcohol administration while still in the scan receiving IV ghrelin or placebo (AFID-2). There were 
significant Drug×AFID-run×Cue-type interactions in the left amygdala (F4,26.8 = 3.54, p = 0.01) and right 
medial orbito-frontal cortex (mOFC) (F4,27.0 = 3.66, p = 0.01), and an interaction at a trend level in the 
left NAc (F4,26.6 = 2.35, p = 0.08) (Farokhnia E Grodin MR Lee et al. ...and L Leggio). Pairwise comparisons
indicated that, during the AFID-1, IV ghrelin compared to placebo increases food-related signal in the left 
NAc (p = 0.03). During the AFID-2, IV ghrelin compared to placebo increases alcohol-related signal in the 
left amygdala (p = 0.03) and decreases food-related signal in the right mOFC (p = 0.04). We had 
anticipated overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_304050]. Rather, 
our results suggest that distinct brain regions involved in motivation, reward and stress processing are 
engaged by [CONTACT_304079] (amygdala) versus food (mOFC, NAc).
GHS-R1a blockade is safe and may reduce craving in heavy drinkers: preliminary findings
We are currently testing PF-5190457, a GHS-R1a inverse agonist. This drug was originally developed by 
[CONTACT_304080]. Common side-effects were sedation and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. In a preliminary human 
laboratory study (14-AA-0042; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288390]), we reported the safety of PF-5190457 in heavy drinkers and we 
also found that this compound reduces alcohol- and food-induced craving in the bar-lab (Lee et al., 2018). 
A follow-up Phase 2a human laboratory study is ongoing (16-DA-0080; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288390]).
3.6 RATIONALE FOR STUDYING GOAT AS A NOVEL TARGET TO TREAT AUD
After the discoveries of GHS-R1a (Howard et al., 1996) and then acyl-ghrelin (Kojima et al., 1999), 
identifying the system in charge of ghrelin’s octanoylation was key, as acyl-ghrelin but not DAG binds with 
high affinity to GHS-R1a. Independent efforts from the Goldstein & Brown (Gutierrez et al., 2008) and Eli 
Lilly (Lim, Kola, Grossman, & Korbonits, 2011) labs led to the discovery of GOAT (Figure 1). GOAT’s 
structure is highly conserved among species (Lim et al., 2011) and its mRNA expression pattern in the 
body resembles that of ghrelin (Romero et al., 2010). GOAT activity is required for octanylation of ghrelin 
and is specific for ghrelin only (Damdindorj et al., 2012). The attention to GOAT has recently increased in 
the ghrelin field. In fact, in addition to its central actions (Banks, Tschop, Robinson, & Heiman, 2002), 
there is now robust evidence that acyl-ghrelin acts on appetite and food intake via peripheral pathways. 
For example, GHS-R1a’s are located on vagal afferent soma (Date et al., 2002; Grabauskas et al., 2015) 
and ghrelin-induced food intake is blocked by [CONTACT_304081] (Inui et al., 2004; le Roux 
et al., 2005). Systemic ghrelin administration suppresses vagal afferent firing, and selective blockade of 
the gastric vagus nerve, either by [CONTACT_304082] (afferent only) or surgical differentiation (afferent and 
efferent pathways), blocks c-Fos expression within the arcuate nucleus in response to ghrelin-induced 
feeding (Asakawa et al., 2001; Benso DH St-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_304051]., 2012; le Roux et al., 2005). These observations 
support that, by [CONTACT_304083]-ghrelin formation, GOAT inhibition may be a promising approach to block 
acyl-ghrelin effects mediated by [CONTACT_304084]. Furthermore, GOAT 
inhibition increases DAG and decreases the acyl-to-total ratio. DAG was thought to be non-active, as it 
binds to GHS-R1a with 1000-fold lower affinity than acyl-ghrelin, and its putative receptor is unknown. It 
has now been shown that DAG may counteract some of the effects of acyl-ghrelin, e.g., DAG infusion 
lowers appetite and blood glucose, and enhances insulin secretion (Ozcan et al., 2014). Also, DAG infusion
PI [CONTACT_5627]: Lorenzo Leggio, M.D., Ph.D., M.Sc.

Version Date: 09/25/2023 
Page 14 of 48lowers acyl-ghrelin concentrations, which may be responsible for reduced appetite and improved glucose 
and insulin secretion (Monteiro, 2014).
Consistent with the physiology and pharmacology of GOAT and the role of the ghrelin system in AUD 
discussed above, we hypothesize that GOAT inhibition may represent a novel pharmacological approach 
to treat AUD. Our hypothesis is further corroborated by [CONTACT_304085]: 1) in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_304052]-5190457 in AUD individuals (14-AA-0042; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288390]), GHS-R1a 
blockade reduced alcohol cue-induced craving and, in parallel, reduced the acyl-to-total ghrelin ratio (Lee 
et al., 2018), thus indirectly providing additional support for the hypothesis that the balance between 
acyl-ghrelin and DAG plays an important role in alcohol craving in humans; and 2) recent independent 
work conducted in the Kunos lab at NIAAA shows that GOAT inhibition reduces alcohol drinking in mice 
using a 2-bottle free choice procedure ( [CONTACT_304136], personal confidential communication, June 2017).

3.7 GLWL-01: PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES AND SAFETY PROFILE IN PHASE 1 STUDIES
GLWL-01: We will test GLWL-01, a highly selective, potent reversible uncompetitive GOAT inhibitor. GLWL 
Research Inc. has conducted in vitro and in vivo rodent work and, notably, a first-in-human clinical study 
in healthy individuals. To our knowledge, GLWL-[ADDRESS_371957] species ranging from 69% to > 100%; time to reach maximum plasma 
concentration is reached consistently within 0.5 hours after oral dosing in rats, dogs, and monkeys ( GLWL 
Research Inc., unpublished/confidential). Based on PK data in healthy subjects, both renal clearance and 
hepatic metabolism are involved in the clearance of GLWL-01. Mean plasma elimination half-life values 
following oral dose administration ranged from 2 to 5.5 hours across different species.

Previous work with GLWL-01 in humans: The first-in-human study conducted by [CONTACT_304086]. 
established the safety and tolerability of GLWL-01 up to 450 mg b.i.d. in humans; the same highest 
allowed dose will be used in our clinical study. This is also consistent with an ongoing clinical trial that 
GLWL Research Inc. is conducting in patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). GOAT engagement was studied in vitro and in vivo in mice and humans. In vitro and in 
vivo mouse studies show that GLWL-[ADDRESS_371958]-in-human study also indicates that GLWL-01 up to 450 mg b.i.d. significantly and 
dose-dependently reduces acyl-ghrelin and increases DAG concentrations (GLWL Research Inc., 
unpublished/confidential). Specifically, administration of single GLWL-01 doses of up to 600 mg QD in 
healthy subjects, and of multiple (up to 28 days) GLWL-01 doses of up to 600 mg BID in obese patients 
with type 2 diabetes was safe and generally well tolerated (GLWL Research Inc., 
unpublished/confidential). Doses of GLWL-01 equal to or higher than 150 mg BID resulted in numerical 
decreases of plasma AG levels in obese patients with type 2 diabetes over 28 days, with the maximum 
decreases observed for the 450-mg BID dose group. Therefore, a 450-mg BID dosing regimen was chosen 
for this study as it has been demonstrated to be safe and to achieve target engagement. For additional 
details, please see the GLWL-01 Investigational Brochure (IB Version Date 17OCT2017).
3.8 INNOVATION
Since 2006, the preclinical and clinical literature on the role of ghrelin and its receptor in AUD has been 
exponentially increasing. As such, targeting the ghrelin receptor system to treat AUD is a highly 
innovative approach. Recent translational work conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_304053] a role of 
ghrelin in alcohol-seeking behaviors (Farokhnia et al., 2018; Leggio et al., 2014). The first translational 
step taken by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_304054]-R1a as a novel 
target to treat AUD. Safety and preliminary behavioral work have been conducted (Lee et al., 2018) and 
additional human work is ongoing under our current protocol, 16-DA-0080. The increasing knowledge of 
the ghrelin system has highlighted the potential role of the GOAT enzyme as a novel approach to target 
the ghrelin system. Therefore, this protocol is highly innovative as it represents the first attempt to test in 
humans the potential role of GOAT inhibition in AUD.
4 STUDY OBJECTIVES:
We propose to test the GOAT inhibitor GLWL-01 as a novel treatment for AUD. This will be a Phase 1b / 
2a, proof-of-concept (early-signal) human laboratory study with GLWL-01 (450 mg b.i.d.).
GLWL-01 and matched placebo are provided by [CONTACT_304086]. under a fully-executed NIH CRADA.
4.1 Primary outcome measures:
The co-primary aims will be to determine:
1) Whether the number of adverse events (AEs) experienced differ in the GLWL-01 condition, 
compared to placebo

4.2 Secondary outcome measures:
The secondary aims will be to determine:
a. Whether GLWL-01, compared to placebo, reduces food choices in a “virtual buffet” conducted in 
a virtual reality context.
Additional outcomes measures:
b. We will also monitor behavioral assessments of pain, anxiety, depression, alcohol craving and 
withdrawal, and smoking.
c. We will also monitor weight as well as food intake via a food intake
[ADDRESS_371959], counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using GLWL-01, in individuals 
with AUD. Subjects will be randomized to the order of the study drug condition (GLWL-01 and then 
placebo; or placebo and then GLWL-01) using a block randomization based on the following two 
variables: sex and smoking status. Associate Investigator Melanie Schwandt, Ph.D., will develop the block 
randomization grid which will be sent to the NIDA IRP Pharmacy staff. No other members of the study 
team will have access to the block randomization grid.
5.3 Screening
The initial screening process for this protocol is conducted under the 06-DA-N415 ,“Evaluation of 
potential research subjects – screening protocol for clinical studies” (hereto referred to as the screening 
protocol). This is a protocol led by [CONTACT_304087] (OCD) at the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program (NIDA IRP) to assess potential research participants’ eligibility 
for entering all protocols at the NIDA/IRP. Additional details can be found in the screening protocol 
documents. As routinely done at the NIDA IRP, the screening procedures and data collected under the 
screening protocol will capture information above and beyond that which is necessary to determine 
eligibility for this protocol but allows the Investigators to assess the eligibility criteria for this protocol.
If suitable, subjects will be offered to participate in this protocol. If subjects agree and sign the consent 
form, they will be enrolled in the study and start the study procedures.
Once enrolled participants may undergo an additional screening process if they leave the inpatient unit 
between Stages [ADDRESS_371960] due to personal emergencies or extenuating 
circumstances (see Overview). Upon returning to the inpatient unit after the temporary leave, they will

positive for any of the following substances: benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturates, cocaine metabolites, 
morphine, oxycodone, methadone, amphetamine, and / or buprenorphine may result in an extension of 
the wash-out window until they are able to provide a negative urine drug screen and BAC or termination of 
study participation and not move forward  to the Stage 2 based on the clinical judgement of the MAI and 
PI. The urine drug screening also includes testing for THC/cannabis however this is not an exclusion 
criterion for this study nor will it result in termination study. The reason why information on cannabis use is 
collected is because, consistent with the initial drug screening, if cannabis use is detected it will be 
assessed and entered a covariate in the data analysis.
The inpatient unit is operated and managed by [CONTACT_304089] (ICTR) and has standardized search procedures for any person staying on the unit. This search 
procedure is to prevent any items that are prohibited or illegal from entering the unit. If any prohibited 
items are found during the search procedure, the study team will be informed, and the items will be 
confiscated per ICTR policy. This will not result in the termination of study participation.
5.4 Overview:
Eligible participants will undergo Stages 1 and 2, where study drug (GLWL-01 or placebo) administration 
will be counterbalanced. A study drug wash-out window of at least [ADDRESS_371962] between Stage 1 
and Stage 2. During each Stage, subjects will take the study drug twice a day (b.i.d.) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_371963] evening dose of the study medication will not be administered. As part of this study, subjects will 
be admitted to an inpatient facility (Clinical Research Unit (CRU)) on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical 
Center (referred to as either Bayview or JHBMC) campus and will remain as inpatients for the duration of 
the two Stages and the wash-out window for an  inpatient stay of approximately [ADDRESS_371964] either in the Bayview CRU or the NIDA IRP Biomedical Research Center (BRC) building which are both 
on the Bayview campus in Baltimore, MD. Participants may only leave the CRU during the wash-out 
window for personal emergencies and extenuating circumstances pending the approval of the PI, MAI or 
other covering health care provider who will evaluate the pass request and determine whether the pass 
may be granted. Participants on approved leave during washout do not receive remuneration while on 
leave and the total number of days on leave do not count toward the 21-day ceiling of stay in our clinical 
facilities during their participation in this study. 
When the participant returns to the CRU after the temporary leave, they will undergo the standard CRU 
participant search procedure and alcohol and drug screening. A positive BAC or urine drug screen that is 
positive for any of the following substances: benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturates, cocaine metabolites, 
morphine, oxycodone, methadone, amphetamine, & buprenorphine  may result in an extension of the 
wash-out window until they are able to provide a negative urine drug screen and or negative BAC or may

Page 18 of 48result in termination of study participation and  not moving on to the Stage 2 based on the clinical 
judgement of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_38564]. The urine drug screening is identical to the initial drug screen used in the 
screening procedure and it also includes testing for THC/cannabis however this is not an exclusion criterion 
nor will it result in termination study. Consistent with the initial drug screening, if cannabis use is detected 
it will be assessed and entered a covariate in the data analysis. After the inpatient stay, one outpatient 
follow-up visit in the clinic will be scheduled approximately a week after the discharge (the exact date may 
vary a little, based on the patient’s schedule) to repeat the blood liver panel.
The following research procedures (1-3 listed below) will take place once in Stage 1 and once in Stage 2. 
These procedures will be the same for Stage 1 and Stage 2. Furthermore, beginning of study procedures 
may be delayed or participant may be withdrawn from the study for any clinical concerns (for example, 
clinically relevant severe alcohol withdrawal and/or any other clinical condition requirement immediate 
medical care).
These study procedures are similar to our ongoing protocol 16-DA-0080, therefore we will be able to compare 
the potential effects of GLWL-01 versus PF-5190457.
5.4.1 Cue-Reactivity (CR) procedure
This procedure will be similar to that used in our previous studies. The CR procedure is performed in a 
bar-like laboratory at NIDA IRP. During the CR procedure, participants are exposed to visual, tactile, 
olfactory, and proprioceptive stimuli associated with the beverage. Participants first will undergo a 3- 
minute relaxation period (‘‘please sit quietly and do nothing’’) to collect pre-CR levels of urge and 
physiological arousal (this first relaxation period may take place outside in a clinical testing room or inside 
the bar-like laboratory). There will be a tray containing a glass half full of water and a commercially 
labeled bottle of water located in the room. An audiotape will instruct the participant to sniff the glass of 
water when s ⁄ he will hear high tones and stop sniffing when s ⁄ he will hear low tones. This procedure 
will include thirteen 5-second olfactory exposures during each 3-minute trial, with variable intervals 
between each exposure. The water trial provides a controlled baseline that controls for all aspects of 
stimuli and movement except for the nature of the beverage. After that, another 3-minute relaxation 
period will follow. Next, participants will undergo a similar procedure with food cues. Food cues will be 
actual food (e.g. snack foods, etc.) and will be personalized based on participants preferences
(participants will be asked about their preferred snacks or other food and the study team will try to match 
what they prefer to what it is available). Time of last meal will be standardized within- and between- 
subject. Participants will have breakfast and the CR procedure will take place at approximately noon.
Lunch will be served after the CR procedure and food craving will be assessed using the State Food- 
Cravings Questionnaire (GFCQ). Finally, two 3-minute alcohol cue exposure trials that will be identical to 
the water trial except the glass of water will be replaced with their preferred alcohol beverage and the 
bottle of water will be replaced with the appropriate commercially-labeled alcohol bottle. Two alcohol 
trials will be conducted to gain a stable estimate of participants’ reactions to alcohol cues and because 
two exposures have proven most sensitive to differential effects in previous studies (trials will be 
presented in the same order for all participants because of known carryover effects). After every 3 
minutes of beverage exposure, participants will rate their urge to drink alcohol by [CONTACT_304090] [CONTACT_5627]: Lorenzo Leggio, M.D., Ph.D., M.Sc.

Page 19 of 48Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) (Bohn, Krahn, & Staehler, 1995). The term urge to drink is explained to the 
subject as “want, desire, craving, thirst for or wish to drink”. The AUQ will be complemented by [CONTACT_304091] (AAS), which consists of two 10-point Likert-type scales assessing attention to the 
sight and smell of water and alcohol cues.
5.4.2 Food choices in a virtual reality environment (VR)
As reviewed by [CONTACT_304092]. (2013), there is increasing evidence that disruption of energy homeostasis 
can affect the reward circuitry and that overconsumption of rewarding food can lead to changes in the 
reward circuitry resulting in compulsive food intake akin to the phenotype seen with addiction. Consistent 
with this concept, several lines of experimental research demonstrate significant commonalities between 
the neural substrates underlying addiction and at least some forms of obesity (Volkow et al., 2013).
Consistent with this body of literature, it is conceivable that a medication effective in reducing alcohol 
craving and drinking, may also have effects in reducing appetite and food intake. This is the case, for 
example, of the FDA-approved naltrexone and of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (for review, see: (Leggio et al., 2011). We 
will explore the potential role of GLWL-01 administration on food-related behaviors. To achieve this goal, 
we will use a “virtual buffet” procedure, which is consistent with the same procedure used by [CONTACT_304093].
Persky at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Immersive Virtual Environment Test 
Unit (IVETU). The “virtual buffet” has already been tested by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Persky’s group in other IRB-approved 
clinical protocols at NHGRI (Bouhlal, McBride, Ward, & Persky, 2015). This procedure permits us to 
investigate, in a well-controlled setting, direct observations of patients’ food selection behaviors. We 
used this procedure in protocol 16-DA-0080. Participants will be given verbal instructions and will have a 
training session on how to use the “virtual buffet”. Participants will be instructed to choose foods and a 
beverage from a hypothetical buffet. In order to perform the virtual reality task, participants will wear a 
head mounted display connected to computer equipment and will use a pointing device to select the 
desired types and amounts of food and beverage. Included on the “Virtual Buffet” will be foods and 
beverages representative of those typi[INVESTIGATOR_304055] a range of nutrient 
profiles and calorie densities. Consistent with the procedures already described in Bouhlal et al. (2015), 
participants will be instructed to choose as many and as much of the virtual food and beverages during 
one trip to the buffet as they would normally choose. Once the virtual plate is full, participants will have 
an opportunity to go back to the buffet and select additional virtual food. The buffet will contain at least 
two options for each food category that would typi[INVESTIGATOR_304056] (main dish, vegetable, fruit, 
starch, dessert, and beverages). Foods will be categorized as “Go” (the healthiest options), “Slow” (less 
healthy options) and “Whoa” (relatively unhealthy options), as described before (Bouhlal et al., 2015).
Participants will indicate their food choice by [CONTACT_2329] a pointing device and then will select the amount of 
food that will go on the plate (e.g., one spoonful, one pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]). Following food selection, participants will be 
able to choose from several possible beverages. The virtual scenario will end when participants indicate 
they are finished selecting food and drink. During all phases of the scenario, we will digitally record 
participants’ movement and location in the room, the direction and pattern of participants’ gaze, 
duration of the session, and all details regarding food selection. The patient’s food choice behavior will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_304094]. Calorie content will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_304095]. Food-related outcomes

Page 20 of 48will be analyzed, including calorie content of food and drink chosen, patterns of engagement with the 
food, order of food selection, time spent in the buffet, portion sizes selected, distribution of different 
food types on the plate, total calorie count of selected food with and without beverages, proportion of 
high calorie foods, sweetened beverage selection, spatial measurements, and food choice process. At the 
end of the procedure, participants will also fill out questionnaires to assess participant’s experiences in 
the virtual environment.

Procedure Day and Cue Reactivity Study Procedure Day). For all blood collection time points 
there are 2 x 3mL and 1 x 4mL samples collected for research bloods and 2 x 3mL samples 
collected for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. On Dosing Day 1, a 3mL blood 
sample will be taken for genetics. The genetic sample is meant to be collected for potential 
future exploratory analysis aimed at investigating pharmacogenetic aspects of GLWL-01. This 
is approximately 131mL per stage and the maximum PK/PD/research blood collected for the 
entire study period will not exceed 455mL for any given participant. (see “Use of Samples”

- Waist circumference will be assessed twice during each Stage (first and last day of each Stage) 
to calculate the body shape index (BSI), which is, compared to BMI, a better indicator of 
health risks related to weight fluctuations.
Suicidality Assessment will be performed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-
SSRS) at baseline (day of consent) as well as the (Stage 2), last study day or day of discharge if 
the participant completes study participation prior to (Stage 2), last study day, whichever occurs 
first.    
Upon determination that screening reveals signs of suicidal ideation or concerning behavior, a mental health 
evaluation will be performed. This evaluation will determine the level of risk and take appropriate steps to 
ensure the patient’s safety.      
 
Subject characterizations:
The following are characterization measures of various behaviors and preferences administered either 
in questionnaire or task form. With the exception of smoking all of these will be done once at the 
beginning of the study before study drug is administered. (please see– Study Outline for timing of these 
procedures). 
a) Sweet Preference Test. There is preclinical and clinical evidence linking the consumption of sweets to 
alcohol intake in both animals and humans (Leggio et al., 2011). We will test the possible effects of 
individuals’ sweet preference characteristic on our study outcomes. Prior to administration, a visual 
examination of the sucrose solution for any particulate matter will be conducted by a clinician, 
proceeding only if no particulate matter is identified. Each subject will be instructed to sip, swish around 
his/her mouth and then spit out five different concentrations of a sweet solution (0.05, 0.10, 0.21, 0.42 
and 0.83 M) each of which will be presented five times in a pseudorandom order for a total of [ADDRESS_371966] concentration of sucrose (0.83 M) as the most pleasurable. Sweet-dislikers could prefer any of 
the other four concentrations. As part of this test, subject will also fill out the Sweet Preference 
Questionnaire(Kampov-Polevoy, Garbutt, & Janowsky, 1997; Looy, Callaghan, & Weingarten, 1992).
b) Brief Addictive Behavior Social Density Assessment (BASDA). The BASDA is a self-reported assessment 
where participants self-report on their closest associates’ drinking behaviors (Fortune et al., 2013; 
MacKillop et al., 2013). Participants are not asked to provide the names of their closest biological and 
non-biological associates. The goal is to explore the social milieu that usually surrounds the participant 
and to see if this information might help to predict craving behavior.
c) Behavioral approach system (BAS)/behavioral inhibition system (BIS) scale . The BAS/BIS scale was 
developed to measure individual differences in the sensitivity of the BIS and BAS (Carver & L. White, 
PI [CONTACT_5627]: Lorenzo Leggio, M.D., Ph.D., M.Sc.
Abbreviated Title: GOAT
Version Date: 09/25/2023 
Page 22 of 481994). The scale is divided into 4 subscales: BAS Drive, BAS Fun Seeking, BAS Reward Responsiveness, and 
BIS. Research suggests these systems play an important role in vulnerability to addiction. The individual 
differences in reward sensitivity measured by [CONTACT_304101]. The goal of this assessment in the current study is to further 
explore how BAS and BIS personality traits relate to alcohol craving and the activation of reward circuitry.
d) Virtual Buffet Questionnaires: The following questionnaires are assessments of individuals’ attitudes 
and cognitions relating to eating and weight that have been linked with behavior change. These 
characterization measures may help to explain variations in subject behavior in aspects of the trial (e.g., 
the virtual buffet).
1. Perceived Family History: weight and alcohol problems (Eisenberg, Street, & Persky, 2017)
2. Implicit Theories of Weight, Alcohol Use and Eating (Burnette, 2010)
3. Causal Beliefs Scale for Alcohol Dependence and Casual Beliefs Scale for Body Weight (Link, 
Phelan, Bresnahan, Stueve, & Pescosolido, 1999; Moss-Morris et al., 2002)
4. Perceptions of Personal Control and Treatment Control (Broadbent, Petrie, Main, & Weinman, 
2006)
5. Self-Stigma and Alcohol Dependence (Schomerus et al., 2011)
6. Perceptions of passing down propensity for disease (Persky, McBride, Faith, Wagner, & Ward, 
2015)
f) Smoking. The high co-morbidity between alcohol and nicotine dependence reflects a strong connection 
between alcoholism and smoking (Littleton, Barron, Prendergast, & Nixon, 2007). We will assess the 
severity of nicotine dependence with the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND; (Heatherton, 
Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerström, 1991)), cigarettes smoked before and then during the duration of the 
study (via the TLFB) and Breath CO levels, for possible exploratory analyses, which might guide future 
alcohol/smoking studies. We will be able to collect the precise number of cigarettes smoked during the 
inpatient stay via the smoking Timeline Follow Back. Furthermore, when experimental procedures will take 
place, smoking breaks will be standardized across and between subjects.
5.4.4 Nutrition
Participants will receive standardized meals to control and monitor caloric intake within and across 
participants. Participants will not be able to eat snacks or meal leftovers ad libitum while on the 
standardized meals. Food-related data, including % of meal eaten, will be recorded. Participants may 
receive a regular diet during the washout period.
5.4.5 Study Medication Check
There is a possibility that subjects and/or Investigators might identify or assume they received the 
GLWL- 01 compound or placebo by [CONTACT_304102]/or interoceptive responses to 
the study medication. Therefore, at the end of each Stage, we will ask subjects and study physician 
which they believed they received. This information will be recorded and assessed to determine whether

outcomes of the study and to assess whether the double-blind process was preserved.
5.4.6 Measurements for safety monitoring
The following safety measures will be performed repeatedly as per below (and as needed, as the clinical 
situation dictates):
-Vital signs (every day during each Stage)
-Check for potential adverse events (every day during each Stage)

all planned data (an example of a scenario is missing blood samples due to problems with the cannula, 
hemolysis, and other technical problems; other examples include schedule conflicts including
e.g. week-ends, holidays, etc.). Nonetheless, every effort is made to minimize these unforeseen problems 
with equipment or study procedures. If one should occur, we may ask the participant to repeat a specific 
experimental procedure (if allowed by [CONTACT_304103], if it is feasible and if the participant 
agrees) in order to avoid having to discard other usable data from a participant. Subjects may receive 
additional compensation if experimental sessions are repeated, consistent with the NIDA Remuneration 
Policy.
Data sharing with other protocols. Data obtained under this protocol and the NIDA screening protocol may 
be shared and combined for analysis. This will also allow us to avoid repeating assessments that are 
scheduled in both protocols during the same period of time, therefore avoiding duplication and minimizing 
participant fatigue. Participants may also consent for other NIH protocols and data collected under those 
protocols may be combined with data from this protocol for exploratory purposes.
This protocol does not meet criteria for genomic data sharing. NIH Human Data Sharing (HDS) policy is not 
applied in this protocol because it is limited by [CONTACT_304104] (CRADA) with GLWL Research Inc.

6.1 Use of samples
Blood samples will be used for:
Research use: samples may be used for future analyses performed either at NIH laboratories or 
other labs outside NIH (the latter will be pending IRB approval and execution of appropriate 
agreement). Future research use of these samples includes blood ghrelin levels, GLWL-01 
concentrations, biomarkers like feeding-related peptides (e.g., leptin, GLP-1, amylin, GIP, 
pancreatic polypeptide, PYY, growth hormone (GH), thyroid hormones, insulin, C-peptide, etc.), 
stress-related hormones (e.g., ACTH, cortisol, etc.) and/or inflammatory markers (e.g., cytokines, 
etc.), and other biomarkers which may be related to the outcomes of the study. Furthermore, as 
part of the fully executed CRADA between GLWL Research Inc. and NIH, GLWL Research Inc. may 
receive de-identified stored blood samples collected in [CONTACT_59890]'s NIH clinical study in order to 
run biomarkers e.g. blood concentrations of hormones like acyl-ghrelin, UAG and other 
biomarkers well as blood concentrations of GLWL-01. This latter aspect of the CRADA is planned 
to generate consistent pharmacokinetic / pharmacogenetic / pharmacodynamic data between [CONTACT_304137]'s clinical study and clinical trials that GLWL Research Inc. is conducting in parallel. The use 
of the same assays will allow for side-by-side comparison and analysis, therefore providing the 
best possible information on the role of GLWL-01 on ghrelin signaling across populations affected 
by [CONTACT_304105].
Clinical use: samples (e.g., glucose, AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin, creatinine, thyroid and 
electrolytes) will be analyzed at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center clinical 
laboratories or other clinical laboratories approved by [CONTACT_304106]. In 
addition to what outlined in the Study Outline, clinical blood labs can be repeated and/or 
additional clinical labs (blood/urine) may be performed if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_304107].

7.1 Analysis of data/ study outcomes
Outcome data will be examined for homogeneity of variance, and if necessary transformed to meet this 
criterion. As this is a within-subjects design, repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be 
used to analyze the primary outcome, with drug condition as the within-subjects factor. Similarly, for 
secondary outcome measures such as food choices, repeated measured ANCOVA will also be used.
Biomarkers and hormonal measurements, such as feeding-related peptides stress-related hormones 
and/or inflammatory markers (see Section G,1), will also be correlated with changes in primary and 
secondary outcomes to explore the relationship between hormonal responses of interest and behavioral 
changes. A probability level of 0.[ADDRESS_371972] in analysis for primary 
and secondary outcome responses. Additional covariates include baseline characteristics, like age, race, 
years of education, alcohol drinking levels, ADS score, family history of alcoholism density and number of 
days of alcohol abstinence prior to enrollment.
7.2 Power analysis
We performed a power analysis for the primary outcome and it is consistent with: 1) our previous Phase 1b 
study (N = 12 completers) with PF-5190457, where the primary outcome was the number of AEs 
experienced differ in the drug condition, compared to placebo; and 2) effect sizes (dz = 0.5) of alcohol cue-
reactivity studies for other medications like the FDA-approved naltrexone and other experimental 
compounds (George et al., 2008; Miranda et al., 2014; Monti et al., 1999, 2000). The goal will be to reach 
up to 34 completers. A sample size of 43 subjects will be needed: a) considering the following parameters: 
dz = 0.5, α  err prob = .05, and power (1-β  err prob) = .80 (see Table 1 for additional details); and b) 
considering an attrition rate of approximately 20%.

8.1 Consent documents and process
Procedures conducted before obtaining consent for this protocol
Screening: subjects are prescreened during a phone screening which is part of the NIDA screening 
protocol. Then, potential candidates are screened in-person under the NIDA screening protocol, which 
will provide the necessary data to determine eligibility to this protocol.
Clearance for eligibility : inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed by a team of three individuals and 
signatures will be required in order to establish participants’ eligibility to this protocol. Once cleared for 
eligibility participants, will be contact[CONTACT_304108].
8.1.1 Consent procedure
On the day of consent eligible participants will undergo an alcohol and drug screening. A positive BAC or 
urine drug screen (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturates, cocaine metabolites, morphine, oxycodone, methadone, 
amphetamine, & buprenorphine and/or any other clinical condition requiring further assessment and 
evaluation may result in consenting procedures being either rescheduled or the participant being classified 
as ineligible. Eligible subjects are enrolled in this protocol after the study-specific consent form for this 
protocol is obtained. Authorized study investigators will obtain informed consents for this protocol. All 
participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, 
procedures and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants as detailed in the 
consent form. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask 
questions regarding this study prior to signing as a copy of the consent will be handed to the participant 
during their screening visit and again on the day of consent. Participants will be asked to sign and date the 
informed consent. A copy of the signed and dated consent will be given to each participant. As part of the 
consent procedure, participants’ ability to understand the consent will be evaluated using the ‘NIDA/NIAAA 
Evaluation of Potential Research Participants’ Ability to Consent’. Subjects must answer all questions 
correctly to proceed with consent signing.
Consent Review Process (in person or remote)
After the potential participant has had the opportunity to review the consent form, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]- 
investigator may conduct the verbal review of the consent form a. in a face-to-face discussion in a private 
study room or b. via encrypted video chat program or c. via a remote-onsite video conference between 
on-site private study rooms, all approved by [CONTACT_133312]’s ISSO. The remote platforms allow a virtual face-to- 
face interaction which we believe enhances the consent process while also reducing person-to-person 
contact. The format to be used will be decided by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-investigator in consultation with the 
prospective participant. Regardless of the platform selected for the review of the consent, e.g., face to face 
or remote from outside of NIDA or within NIDA’s physical space, the PI/co-investigator will obtain the

10 STUDY AGENTS/INTERVENTIONS
10.1 Study Drug
Based on GLWL-01 nonclinical and preliminary clinical data (for details, please see Investigational Brochure, 
IB Version Date 17OCT2017), no clinically significant safety or tolerability concerns have been identified in 
patients or subjects to date for GLWL-[ADDRESS_371976] a lower dose compared to the maximum dose previously tested and the total days of 
drug exposure will also be lower. However, it is also important to keep in mind that GLWL-01 is 
investigational, and all of its possible side effects may not be known. There may be rare or unknown side 
effects and some of these may be life-threatening. Drug administration may be temporarily held or stopped 
due to side-effects or other safety concerns.
As of June 2017, GLWL-01 has been given to 24 healthy overweight/obese humans and [ADDRESS_371977] commonly reported side effects in this study 
were headache, diarrhea, decreased appetite and stomachache. From preclinical and clinical studies (hERG 
and single/multiple dosing human studies) conducted by [CONTACT_304086]., the proarrhymic potential of 
GLWL-01 is low (GLWL-01 Investigational Brochure, IB Version Date 17OCT2017). Specifically, single 12-
lead ECG’s were collected in 28-day MAD dosing persons with diabetes up to 600 mg bid (patients were 
excluded for ECG’s that demonstrated findings that might obscure safety evaluation, including conduction 
abnormalities). The following were noted (GLWL Research Inc., unpublished data and personal 
communications): a) one subject treated with GLWL-01 600mg BID dose experienced the following changes 
from a baseline QTcB of 396 ms: on Day 3, QTcB was 477 msec, then again on Day 3 two hours later it was 
474 msec, and finally on Day 5 it was 408 ms. Three subjects dosed with GLWL-01 at 450 mg BID had QTcB 
as follows after dosing: [ADDRESS_371978]; [ADDRESS_371979]; and [ADDRESS_371980]. In summary, three cases of QTc prolongation (> 450 msec) were observed, 
but there were no arrhythmias and no cardiovascular symptoms. There were no QT intervals measured 
that were >500 msec (a cut-off that, if persistent, is a risk factor for the development torsade’s de pointes).

Page 35 of 48The ongoing clinical study conducted by [CONTACT_304086]. in Prader-Willi Syndrome patients is dosing 
GLWL-01 at the 450 mg BID level; thus far, there has not been a signal for QTc prolongation. In this Prader-
Willi Syndrome study, the investigators are using the Fridericia equation for QT correction which should 
minimize false positives that may arise from concurrent increases in heart rate (GLWL Research Inc., 
personal communications on September and October 2018).
Update (May 6, 2022): during the execution of this clinical study, a moderate adverse event of transient 
asymptomatic transaminitis was reported in one participant (possibly related to the study drug) and the 
consent was updated accordingly. Of note, this potential risk was already described in the IB from rodent 
studies conducted by [CONTACT_3455].
Study drug and matched placebo will be provided by [CONTACT_7904] (GLWL Research Inc.) and its storage, 
dispensing and waste processes and procedures will be managed by [CONTACT_304113]. Study drug is 
administered by [CONTACT_304114], MAI or other authorized NIH health care provider.
10.2 Blood draw
The total amount of research blood to be drawn for this protocol will be up to 461 cc. Risks of blood draws 
include discomfort or possible bruising (hematoma) at the site of needle entry. For blood draws, there is 
also a small risk of fainting or infection at the site of the needle stick. Risks from blood draws are minimized 
by [CONTACT_304115].
10.3 ECG recording
Subjects may experience some discomfort when electrodes will be removed from the skin, which should 
resolve quickly.
10.4 Rating Scales, Questionnaires and other Behavioral Assessments
Participants are asked to complete rating scales and questionnaires (paper-and-pencil or computerized) as 
part of the study. Some individuals may feel emotional discomfort answering some of the items on rating 
scales. Such stress will be managed by [CONTACT_3476]. If needed, participants have immediate access to 
licensed health care professionals.
10.[ADDRESS_371981]. Leggio’s team. Increased 
craving and distress may appear during the CR procedure. Staff members will monitor the participant via [ADDRESS_371982] mirror in the ‘bar-like’ room and the participant will always be able to communicate with staff 
members. Should clinically significant symptoms appear, participants will have immediate access to 
licensed health care professionals. Additionally, these risks are minimized by [CONTACT_304116]. Of note, alcohol cue reactivity experiments are performed only during the cue reactivity 
procedure, and the study does not include any alcohol administration at any point.

Page 36 of 4810.6 “Virtual Buffet”
Previous studies conducted at the NHGRI Immersive Virtual Environment Test Unit (IVETU) located at the 
NIH Clinical Center show the safety of this experimental procedure. In the virtual environment encounters 
previously conducted at NHGRI, there were no incidences of serious cybersickness. Some individuals may 
experience mild symptoms of motion sickness (also called cybersickness in this context). These symptoms 
may include mild dizziness, headache, eyestrain, blurred vision, light sensitivity, and/or nausea. Such 
symptoms are rarely strong, and we will discontinue the virtual session should participants report onset of 
these symptoms. We will continue the virtual session only if the participant desires, all symptoms have 
subsided, and a clinician approved the continuation of the experiment. Participants will be screened so as 
to exclude individuals with conditions or history that would make them particularly susceptible to 
cybersickness. Furthermore, they will be instructed and reminded to report any symptoms during the 
encounter. [CONTACT_59890]’s team is experienced in executing this procedure in one of his ongoing clinical 
protocols.
Counseling: At the end of the study, consistent with previous studies from our team (e.g. 13-AA-0040; 13- 
AA-0043; 14-AA-0042, 16-DA-0080 and 17-AA-0093) participants will be debriefed on their drinking and 
receive counseling guidance and recommendations aimed at enhancing their readiness for behavioral 
change and treatment as recommended by [CONTACT_288461] (NIAAA, 2005). This counseling session 
will follow the NIAAA pamphlet “Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_25190]: a clinician’s guide ” (US Department 
of Health and Human Services, 2005). Their alcohol consumption pattern and quantity will be reviewed 
with them and linked to consequences they may have experienced; clear recommendations will be made 
for them to reduce or stop drinking.

medical advice. In order to decrease the risk of this, participants will not be paid in cash on the same day of 
testing.
11 PLAN FOR REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS AND ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse events, protocol deviations, unanticipated problems (UP), Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects 
(UADEs), serious adverse events are defined as described in NIH HRPP Policy 801-Reporting Research 
Events. The NIH Principal Investigators (PIs)/designee and, as applicable, non-NIH Investigators must report 
events to the IRB via the Reportable Event Submission Form (REF) in NIH iRIS. All adverse events, 
deviations, and unanticipated problems will be summarized and reported at the time of Continuing Review 
in accordance with this policy.
Consistent with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), an adverse event (AE) is any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease

related to the medical treatment or procedure.
12 DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN
The DSMP is consistent with the NIH policy 503 Specifically:
1.Monitoring mechanism: this study is monitored by [CONTACT_304117]/NIAAA Addictions DSMB
2.Frequency of the monitoring: Initial DSMB review takes place before the study begins. 
Subsequent DSMB reviews take place after each [ADDRESS_371984] been exposed to study 
drug, unless otherwise recommended by [CONTACT_304118]
3.Stop or change rules: The following rules are followed: 
3a. Criteria for individual subject withdrawal:
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that is judged by [CONTACT_304119];
At the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or MAI and/or other health care provider involved in 
the study based on tolerability as well as adverse event (AE) severity, or self-reported 
symptoms and/or observed changes in patient’s well-being as reported by [CONTACT_304120], weight/BMI, 
blood/urine laboratory values, etc.
ECG’s (See Study Outline) will be monitored during each Stage as follows:
ECG 12 lead with QTcF measurement (Fridericia equation) collected during STAGE 1 
at Baseline (prior to dosing), Dosing Day 3, on Last Study Day, and on Washout Day -2 
(or last Washout day if washout period extends beyond two days). ECG 12 lead with 
QTcF measurement (Fridericia equation) collected during STAGE [ADDRESS_371985] study drug 
administration. If there is prolongation of the QTcF interval, either to >500 ms, or to 
> 60 ms over that on Day 1 ECG AND the absolute QTcF > 450 ms for males or >470 
ms for females (both criteria must be met), ECG will be repeated and evaluated;
Significant non-compliance with protocol procedures or Investigator request;
Patient request.
4.Advanced plans for any interim analyses and/or futility analyses. There are no current plans 
for interim analyses and/or futility analyses
5.Information to be monitored. Progress of the study, including assessment of participant 
recruitment and accrual and adverse events are reviewed to determine whether there is any 
change to the risk: benefit ratio of the study. Specific parameters that are monitored include 
vital signs and potential adverse events.
6.Communication. The information to be monitored referenced above is reported to the DSMB

review, and to the FDA at the time of annual report. Adverse events are recorded and 
reported to the Clinical Director, the NIH IRB, the Addictions DSMB, and the FDA in 
accordance with all NIH requirements for adverse event reporting
13 CLINICAL MONITORING PLAN
Quality assurance (QA) will be performed by [CONTACT_32366], as well as by a QA monitor, which according 
to established practice is considered sufficient for small, single-site trials, like the present project. The QA 
monitor for this study will have considerable expertise in clinical trials and will monitor the study binders 
on a regular basis and consistent with recruitment pace. Additionally, quality assurance will be monitored 
independently by [CONTACT_304121]/NIDA Combined Monitoring Plan, Intramural Research Program Auditing 
Committee (IRPAC) Coordinated by [CONTACT_304122]. The NIAAA/NIDA 
Combined Monitoring Plan, Intramural Research Program Auditing Committee (IRPAC) monitors intramural 
research studies to ensure compliance with GCP, organizational policies and applicable federal, state and 
local laws and the reliability of study data.

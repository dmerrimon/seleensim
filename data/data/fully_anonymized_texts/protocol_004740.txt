better normalization of the blood sugars in childre n 
with long-standing diabetes using hybrid closed-loo p 
technology on specific metrics of brain structure a nd 
function and cognition. 
Objectives To determine if substantial improvement in glycemic  
control and reduced exposure to hyper- and 
hypoglycemia (using continuous hybrid closed-loop 
devices)  
(a) alters trajectories of total and regional gray and 
white matter volumes, white matter microstructure, and 
task- and resting-state blood oxygen level dependen t 
(BOLD) activation, and  
(b) alters general and specific neurocognitive metr ics 
in adolescents with long-standing T1D. 
We hypothesize that if the neuroimaging and cogniti ve 
differences observed in young children with T1D are  
due in part to repeated hypo- and hyperglycemic 
insults, that prolonged improvement of the blood 
sugars and decreased glycemic variability will crea te a 
neurodevelopmental trajectory towards normalization  
of total and regional brain volumes, white matter 
microstructure, specific neurocognitive functions, and 
BOLD-fMRI activation patterns.  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], pr oof of 
concept study to help us gather preliminary data to  be 
used in a larger, more comprehensive study.  
Study Design Adolescents with T1D 14 years and older who wish to  
transition to hybrid closed-loop therapy who are wi lling 
to be randomized will be recruited. Subjects will b e 
randomized to 6 months of continuous hybrid-CL 
therapy (N= 25, T1D hybrid closed-loop group), vs. 
Standard Care diabetes management (N=25, T1D 
controls)  Unsedated MRI, DTI, fMRI and age-
appropriate cognitive data will be collected, as we ll as 
demographics, CGM and HbA1c. Data from the final 
time-point assessment will be used for subjects 
enrolled in our current longitudinal study.  The st udy 
will have 3 components : baseline data collection 
period, hybrid closed-loop phase, and final data

1:[ADDRESS_126557] that bot h hyper- and hypoglycemia, depending on age and 
severity, can lead to altered brain structure and n eurocognitive function [1, 2]. In early-onset diabe tes, subjects 
may show altered brain morphology, and the young de velopi[INVESTIGATOR_113412] [3, 4]. An area especially sensitive to insult from  
hypoglycemia is the hippocampus [5-7], which could potentially explain in part the learning and memory  
dysfunction observed in some studies of children wi th diabetes [8-12]. Performing brain MRI in 62 chil dren (mean 
age 9.8 years) with early-onset diabetes ( ∼3 years) Ho et al. [13] showed a high prevalence of  central nervous 
system structural abnormalities and mesial temporal  sclerosis. Greater hyperglycemia was correlated wi th 
decreased white matter volumes in the parietal cort ex in children [14] and with smaller cortical cells  with reduced 
myelin content in rodents [15]. Prospective and cro ss-sectional cohort studies have examined cognitive  
functioning in youth with T1D vs. control subjects,  and similar to adults, youth with diabetes tend to  show lower 
intelligence quotients (IQs) and deficits in execut ive functioning, particularly attention, epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564] a nd spatial 
working memory, and processing speed, as compared w ith control subjects [1, 3, 4, 9-12]. However, long itudinal 
studies of cognition in youth with T1D have shown m ore mixed results [16, 17].   
We previously conducted a longitudinal study in you ng children with ( n = 144) and without ( n = 72) T1D (ages 4 
to <10 years) to prospectively examine the impact o f dysglycemia on brain and cognitive development. W e used 
high-resolution structural and diffusion-weighted M RI (Siemens 3T, TimTrio), a comprehensive battery o f 
cognitive metrics, and serial glycemic measures fro m continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) [18-20]. The MRI 
studies were performed unsedated using simple desen sitization/training protocols with a 92% successful  scan 
rate [21]. Baseline assessments showed that hypergl ycemia was associated with lower scores for executi ve 
functions, intelligence, learning, and memory [19] as well as aberrant gray matter (GM) and white matt er (WM) 
structural variations [18, 20]. Of note, although b etween-group cognitive differences detected at base line were 
relatively subtle, neuroanatomical differences were  substantial. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we 
observed significant differences in specific brain regions in children with diabetes versus control su bjects [20], in 
particular within areas involved in visual-spatial processing, executive functions and working memory.  Greater 
hyperglycemia was associated with smaller GMV in me dial-frontal and temporal-occipi[INVESTIGATOR_113413] [18, 20]. We also  found significant differences in WM microstructure , suggesting 
widespread aberrant fiber coherence in young childr en with diabetes; differences correlated with longe r disease 
duration, increased glycated hemoglobin, and greate r hyperglycemia [18]. These cross-sectional observa tions 
raised important questions concerning longitudinal trajectories of neurodevelopment in childhood-onset  diabetes 
[22].   
We repeated unsedated brain neuroimaging and cognit ive testing after [ADDRESS_126558], or worsen over ti me. We 
also correlated these neuroanatomical changes with longer (18 months) exposure to hypo- and hyperglyce mia 
and with targeted measures of neurocognitive functi on longitudinally [23].  Children with diabetes had  slower 
total gray and white matter growth than control sub jects. Particular gray matter regions (left precune us, right 
temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes and right med ial-frontal cortex) showed lesser growth in diabete s, as did 
white matter areas (splenium of the corpus callosum , bilateral superior-parietal lobe, bilateral anter ior forceps, 
and inferior-frontal fasciculus). These changes wer e associated with higher cumulative hyperglycemia a nd 
glucose variability but not with hypoglycemia [23].  Young children with T1D had significant difference s in total 
and regional gray and white matter growth in brain regions involved in complex sensorimotor processing  and 
cognition compared with age-matched control subject s over 18 months, suggesting that chronic hyperglyc emia 
may be detrimental to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866]. In this  large cohort of young children (age 4 to <10 years ) with and 
without T1D studied longitudinally, our studies dem onstrate that early-onset diabetes significantly af fects the 
development of total and regional gray and white ma tter volumes (WMV), with differences between groups  
enhanced over time. Importantly, in the diabetic gr oup, the slower growth was most strongly associated  with 
hyperglycemia and glycemic variability, as measured  by [CONTACT_113442], including glycated hemoglobin,  and 
NEMOURS CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER  
 
 PAGE 12  OF 39 extensive quarterly data from CGM. These findings w ere further supported by [CONTACT_113443] t hat 
slower brain growth in T1D is identifiable with dif ferent, complementary image processing methods incl uding 
results from the FreeSurfer analysis pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189] [24] [See Preliminary Data  section] These studies provide strong 
evidence that the developi[INVESTIGATOR_113414] a vulnerable target for diabetes complications  [23].  
We also repeated the cognitive testing performed at  baseline and found that the cognitive domain score s in these 
children did not differ between groups at 18 months  and did not change differently between groups over  the 
follow-up period [25]. However, within the T1D grou p, a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was cor related 
with lower verbal IQ and greater hyperglycemia expo sure (HbA1c area under the curve since diagnosis) w as 
inversely correlated to executive functions test pe rformance. In addition, those with a history of bot h types of 
exposure performed most poorly on measures of execu tive function. This finding indicated that within t he T1D 
group, associations between cognition (verbal IQ an d executive functions) and glycemic variables (chro nic 
hyperglycemia and DKA history) continued to be evid ent at [ADDRESS_126559] that verbal IQ is now 
significantly lower in the T1D group (see Preliminary Data ).   
Because childhood is a period of rapid and dynamic brain development, including modification and pruni ng of 
synapses and increased myelination of white matter fiber tracts, it also is a time of increased vulner ability to 
brain insults [26, 27]. Hence, continued longitudin al study of this T1D cohort and their carefully mat ched healthy 
comparison group is the central focus of our curren t R01.  We are presently in the 3 rd year of the grant cycle with 
a cohort that includes 74% of the original children  studied with T1D and their age-matched controls. F urther, we 
are using identical protocols for acquisition of st ructural MRI (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) , 
neurocognitive and glycemic data at 2 additional ti me points spread 2 years apart as the children grow  and 
progress through puberty. We were also funded to in clude BOLD-fMRI (task and resting-state) studies du ring 
these later time points.  
 
In the ongoing parent grant, we aim to determine ov er longitudinal follow up:  
 If abnormalities in (1) total and regional gray an d GMVs, and (2) white matter microstructure persist  or worsen 
compared to age- and sex-matched, non-diabetic cont rols, and whether these changes are associated with  
measures of glycemic  control and neurocognitive metrics as these childre n grow and progress through 
puberty;      
 If children with T1D show abnormalities in BOLD-fM RI brain activity compared to controls in (1) front al-
parietal networks associated with visual-spatial wo rking memory and response inhibition abilities, and  (2) 
functional connectivity of resting state networks;   
 If there are differences in key metrics reflecting  general (e.g., IQ) and specific (e.g., executive, visual-spatial, 
memory) neurocognitive functions in the T1D group c ompared to controls, and whether these differences are 
associated with measures of glycemic  control. 
 
We are well on our way to accomplish these goals an d, to-date, have recruited and re-studied all of th e 
214 targeted youth [see Preliminary Data section].   
Closed-Loop Studies – towards the goal of normoglyc emia 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_113415], children with diabetes are still exposed to signifi cant hyper- 
and hypoglycemia. Data in 8 to 17 year olds [28] in dicated children spent over 40% of night and day wi th glucose 
values >180 mg/dl, and in our DirecNet study of 4 t o 9 year olds even higher at ~ 50% [29]. Furthermor e, 
hypoglycemia occurred in ~10% of nights, with mean duration over 80 minutes, and 23% of subjects had a t least 
two hours of hypoglycemia per event [30] . Recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_113416] a large  cohort of patients followed 
in specialty endocrine clinics participating in the  T1D Exchange network around the US confirms that a dolescents 
(13-18yrs) continue to be the age group with the wo rst metabolic control (mean HbA1c 9.0%), despi[INVESTIGATOR_113417], including insulin pumps and CGM  [31]. When considering those childre n that

impact of chronic exposure to abnormal blood glucos e in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_113418].   
Given our findings that the degree of hyperglycemia  correlated positively with the observed neuroanato mical and 
neurocognitive changes, we posit that it may be pos sible to influence or modify the trajectory of thes e observed

children with T1D [28, 29] have not demonstrated be nefit from the use of CGM per se  to lower glucose levels or 
the risk of severe hypoglycemia [28], suggesting a closed-loop feedback controlled insulin delivery sy stem will 
be needed to achieve optimal metabolic control in y outh. Over the last 2-3 years there has been an exp losion of 
studies demonstrating the feasibility, safety and e fficacy of closed-loop insulin delivery systems tha t could better 
accomplish metabolic control. Different from insuli n pump therapy and threshold-suspend approaches, th e 
artificial pancreas or closed-loop systems use a co ntrol algorithm that can increase and decrease subc utaneous 
insulin delivery based on sensor glucose levels in real-time autonomously and continually [32]. In bot h in-patient 
or controlled settings [33-37] and more recently al so in outpatient settings (considered transitional ), and using 
remote monitoring and supervision by [CONTACT_113444] [38] or diabetes camps [39, 40], studies show that  
glucose control can improve, and reduction of hypog lycemia can be accomplished [39-42]. Three weeks to  [ADDRESS_126560] been performed in adolescents and 
adults [43-46]. Home studies [46, 47] of unsupervis ed day-and-night closed-loop use have now been perf ormed 
in adults, and recently, unsupervised day-and-night  hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery in free-living  settings in 
adolescents 10–18 years of age was reported with po sitive results [48].  In aggregate, these results a nd the 
preliminary data presented below strongly suggest t hat marked improvement of glycemic variability and better 
glycemic control are possible using these systems i n the outpatient setting in children. One such hybr id closed-
loop system, the MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump has rece ntly received FDA approval for adults and children down 
to age 14 years [49] and is presently being tested in pi[INVESTIGATOR_113419]-approved outpatient trials in over 3 00 patients 
as young as 7 years (Clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).    
It is relatively easier to achieve good glycemic co ntrol at night with closed-loop systems because the  effects of 
meal and exercise disturbances are less frequent.  In studies in preadolescents using a bi-hormonal (i nsulin and 
glucagon) system at night for at least 5 nights in an outpatient setting [50] the mean overnight senso r glucose 
was 137 mg/dl and % of readings <60 mg/dl was 2%. I n adults using a nighttime only closed-loop system the 
mean time spent in target range was higher with the  use of the artificial pancreas [51].  Using insuli n only closed-
loop systems during both the day and night in adult s and adolescents in an outpatient setting for at l east five 
days [46, 47, 52, 53] the mean sensor glucose was 1 53 mg/dl and the %of glucose values <70 mg/dl was 2 .9% 
(range 1.5-2.8%).  The mean estimated HbA1c for the se studies would be 7.0% based on average sensor 
glucose values.  The longest published trials of hy brid closed-loop to date is of 3 months duration an d achieved 
a mean HbA1c of 7.3% [46] and 6.9% [49]. We hence propose to study children with T1 diabetes  who use 
a state-of-the-art hybrid closed-loop system contin uously in order to assess the impact of improved 
glycemic control on brain and cognition.   
1.[ADDRESS_126561] utilized multiple, complementary image pro cessing 
approaches including voxel-based morphometry (VBM),  surface/vertex based analyses (with FreeSurfer) an d 
state-of-the-art tools to assess DTI data (e.g., FS L TBSS, Tracula). In our most recent analysis of 21 4 children, 
we examined between-group differences in brain grow th with VBM over 18 months and showed slower brain 
growth and smaller gray and GMVs at 18 months in th e T1D group vs. controls (Figure 1) [23]. 
 
Using the FreeSurfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_113420]-analyz ed our structural data and observed that, relative to controls, 
children with diabetes had significantly less growt h of cortical GMV and cortical surface area, and si gnificantly 
less growth of GMV throughout the cortex and cerebe llum. For the diabetic population, the change acros s 
longitudinal time points of the blood glucose level  at the time of scan was negatively correlated with  the change 
in GMV. These results largely confirmed and extende d our initial findings using VBM (Figure 2) [24].

In our serial MRI images showed a correlation with the 
differences in the blood glucose at the time of the  scan and 
changes in grey matter brain volume, left cerebral white matter, 
the corpus callosum, brain stem, mean cortical thic kness, and 
ventricular volume changes [24] .   
 
 
Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI)  is 
increasingly being used as a 
sensitive and specific measure of the 
integrity of intrinsic brain connectivity. 
As such, rsfMRI data were acquired 
in a subset of our cohort consisting of 
57 children with T1D (27F) and 26 
age-matched non-diabetic controls 
(14F). Data were analyzed using both 
model-driven seed-based analysis 
and model-free independent 
component analysis, while controlling 
for age, sex and data acquisition site. 
Converging results were obtained 
across both methods indicating 
increased connectivity in children 
with T1D compared to non-diabetic 
controls. Further, connectivity was 
positively associated with cognitive 
functioning in T1D (Figure 3). The 
observed positive association of 
connectivity with cognitive 
functioning in childhood T1D, without group differe nces in cognitive function (at the time of the scan ), suggests 
a putative compensatory role of hyper-intrinsic con nectivity in the brain. This study aims to fill a c ritical knowledge 
gap on how dysglycemia in T1D might affect the brai n’s intrinsic connectivity at very young ages [54].

 PAGE 15  OF 39 1.2.2 Preliminary Data – Using Hybrid Closed-Loop D evices to Improve Blood Glucose  
Investigators in our consortium ([CONTACT_113489] and  [CONTACT_113490]) have been pi[INVESTIGATOR_113421] n of 
closed-loop systems in the pediatric population, pu blishing the first studies in children in 2008, and  characterizing 
the incremental improvements in the algorithms and hardware as these systems have moved from controlle d 
inpatient studies to supervised outpatient studies in camp- and home-based environments.  
 
1) Nocturnal predictive low-glucose 
suspend – In two separate studies, 
Buckingham, et al randomized 45 
adolescents/adults and [ADDRESS_126562] the predictive suspend feature 
randomly engaged or disengaged for up 
to 6 weeks of wear.  Results showed that 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_113422] < 60 
mg/dL were lower on suspend vs. control 
nights (21% vs. 33%), and the median 
hypoglycemia area under the curve was 
reduced 81% on suspend nights [55]. 
Time spent with nighttime sensor glucose 
levels <70mg/dL was reduced from 
10.1% to 4.6% in 11-14 year old and from 
6.2% to 3.1% in 4-10 year olds (p<0.001) 
[56]. 
2) Day and night hybrid closed-loop control  – After demonstrating feasibility over 6 days and nights in the 
challenging environment of a sleep-over camp [52], studies were conducted a multi-site hotel-based out patient 
study in 15 adolescents over 5 days and nights usin g a hybrid day-and-night closed-loop system nearly identical 
to the system proposed in the current application ( subjects continued to count carbohydrates and bolus  for meals 
and snacks). Significant improvements were observed  in mean glucose levels overall, and particularly o vernight, 
even in the short duration of the study.  Investiga tors at Stanford and Yale also participated in a pi [INVESTIGATOR_113423] -loop system (670G pump), which is the system we pr opose 
to utilize in the present application.  In this stu dy of 
unsupervised home use of a hybrid closed-loop 
system in 124 adults and adolescents, we 
demonstrated significant improvement in A1c levels,  
increased time in target glucose levels, and reduce d 
time in hypo- and hyperglycemia.  In the adolescent  
subset, mean A1c levels dropped from 7.7± 0.8% to 
7.1± 0.6% after 3 months on the system, with over 
2/3 of glucose values in target range, <3% of 
glucose levels under 70 mg/dL, and no epi[INVESTIGATOR_113424] [49] (Figure 4). The 
stabilization of overnight glucose values will also  
likely decrease large osmotic shifts prior to an MR I.     
 
1.2.3 Preliminary Data From Current RO1 (Sept 2014 – May 2017) 
 
In our current R01, we successfully established a n ew system of complementary coordinating centers, on e 
clinical coordinating center at the Nemours Childre n’s Health System in Jacksonville, [LOCATION_012] (Mauras – PI, 
contact [CONTACT_976]) and a data and imaging coordinating cen ter at Stanford (Allan Reiss – PI), as well as a ne w 
infrastructure for data capture and storage using t he REDCap database. A neurocognitive core for centr alized 
double scoring of the cognitive data was also estab lished at Nemours. The 1st 6 months of the new cycl e were 
spent organizing this infrastructure, securing IRB approvals for all 5 participating sites, establishi ng all 
subcontracts and securing all necessary support fro m needed partnerships for MRI scanning at the Unive rsity of 
Figure 3:  (A-B) Group differences in seed-based functional c onnectivity. (A) Seed-
location: R. lingual gyrus and (B) seed-location: L . prefrontal cortex. (C) Increase in 
observed connectivity in the T1D group was positive ly related to cognitive functioning. 
Figure [ADDRESS_126563] (DSMB) was reconvened from the sam e committee that monitored our grant in the previou s 
cycle and protocol thoroughly reviewed and approved . Standard operating procedures were crafted for ou r 
Manual of Operations as well as governing structure  with [ADDRESS_126564] by [CONTACT_113446].  An inves tigator’s website as well as a public site have bee n established 
(https://direcnet.stanford.edu). The study is liste d in clinicaltrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
In our current R01 grant we sought to recruit as ma ny of the 
[ADDRESS_126565] successfully recruited the entire targeted coh ort, 74% of 
the original children returning, 26% replaced; clin ical 
characteristics are summarized in Table 2. All imag ing and 
cognitive assessments have been performed as planne d and 
subjects are followed longitudinally every 3 months  and a 
CGM worn for 6 days and data downloaded. All time 3  (T3) 
data have been collected.    
1.2.4 Preliminary Analysis of New Neurocognitive Da ta - 
We confined interim analysis of cognitive variables  to IQ in the subset currently available (N=120 T1D , 69 
controls). After controlling for Parent IQ, the T1D  group had lower Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), 
but similar Performance IQ (PIQ) compared to the Co ntrol group (VIQ: Cohen’s d=-0.46, p=.004; FSIQ: d= -
0.33, p=.031; PIQ: d=-0.05, p=.651). Within the VIQ  subtasks, groups differed most on Vocabulary (d=-0 .43, 
p=.007). Within the T1D group, greater hyperglycemi a exposure (measured by [CONTACT_113447] A1c AUC >6.0%) 
was associated with lower VIQ (partial r=-0.27, p=. 006), and lower Vocabulary (partial r=-0.32, p=.001 ) after 
controlling for Parent IQ as shown in the scatterpl ots in Figure 5.  These findings indicate that grou p 
differences in IQ are present in our cohort and low er IQ scores are associated with greater degree of chronic 
exposure to hyperglycemia. 
 
We will use the same analytic methods utilized for the present grant (MRI, DTI, fMRI, cognitive testin g, CGM and 
glycemic indices) in order to compare results after  [ADDRESS_126566] care. This greatly economizes and leverages our res ources

 PAGE 17  OF 39 I.3 INNOVATION:  The brain as a target of diabetes complications ha s not received as much attention as other 
areas, particularly in children. Deleterious effect s of severe hypoglycemia, particularly in the hippo campus and 
frontal cortex have been detected, and differences in brain volumes are evident in multiple brain regi ons in the 
diabetic state. Experimental evidence also suggests  that chronic hyperglycemia may affect GMV, myelin 
glycosylation and cognitive processing speed in dia betes. Our data sugest that hyperglycemia may also be 
damaging to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866]. Tight glycemic co ntrol in very young children with T1D has been limi ted by 
[CONTACT_113449], greatly limiting our  ability to 
maintain near-normoglycemia in this age group.   
This study will be the first to examine whether imp roved glycemic control and decreased glucose variab ility 
resulting from hybrid closed-loop control can impro ve brain and cognitive development. In support of t he 
feasibility of this aspect of our study, it is clea r from research in other clinical groups that signi ficant changes in 
GMV, WMV, white matter microstructure and brain act ivation can occur in association with intervention within a 
6-month period (or less). For example, short-term w eight restoration for underweight patients with ano rexia 
nervosa over a 50-day (average) period resulted in significant increases in gray and white matter volu me relative 
to healthy controls [57]. In individuals with alcoh ol abuse, two weeks of supervised abstinence was as sociated 
with significant recovery of GMV in several brain r egions including the cerebellum and parietal lobe [ 58]. In a 
separate study [59], individuals with alcohol addic tion showed significant improvement in white matter  measures 
after one month as reflected by [CONTACT_113450] (FA) in the temporal lobe or in creased 
WMV in the frontal and temporal lobes. In both of t hese disorders, alcohol abuse/addiction and anorexi a, 
mitigation of an ongoing biological insult (alcohol  or starvation) resulted in rapid changes in neuroi maging metrics 
towards normalization. There are additional example s of rapid changes in neuroimaging metrics in other  clinical 
groups receiving disorder-focused intervention. Adm inistration of risperidone and ziprasidone to patie nts with 
schizophrenia led to increased cerebral GMV after 2 8 days of treatment [60] and administration of cita lopram to 
depressed patients increased hippocampal gray matte r within 8 weeks [61]. Rapid changes have also been  
observed in white matter microstructure in other cl inical groups. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS ) showed 
increases in FA within 2 months of facilitation of physiotherapy [62], depressed patients showed incre ased FA 
with 4 weeks from psychotherapy [63], and patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder showed a reversa l of 
abnormal WM microstructure associated with a 12-wee k course of antidepressant (SSRI) treatment [64]. T he 
feasibility and utility of utilizing functional neu roimaging changes as a putative biomarker of interv ention has been 
demonstrated in hundreds of treatment studies, as d escribed in recent reviews of pharmacology, psychot herapy, 
pain management and rehabilitation [65-71]. Thus, w e predict that better normalization of blood glucos e using 
hybrid closed-loop systems can improve/normalize br ain structure and function, and neurocognitive perf ormance 
in adolescents with T1D within a 6-month period, a time period of detectable change well-supported by [CONTACT_113451]. Results obtained from our study can also serv e as the foundation for further investigations of b rain 
development and function during full-time hybrid cl osed-loop control and over larger and more varied a ge groups, 
such as younger children in whom we have previously  demonstrated blunted glucose counter-regulation [7 2].  
 
Chapter 2:  Specific Aims and Hypothesis  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof of concept study largely due  to funding constraints, which we anticipate will p rovide critically 
important preliminary data for a larger and longer- term study. The overarching aims of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_1427] y are to 
determine if substantial improvement in glycemic co ntrol and reduced exposure to hyper- and hypoglycem ia 
(using hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery devices)  (a) alters trajectories of total and regional gray  and white 
matter volumes, white matter microstructure, and ta sk- and resting-state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) 
activation, and (b) alters general and specific neu rocognitive metrics in adolescents with long-standi ng T1D. We 
hypothesize that if the neuroimaging and cognitive abnormalities observed in young children with T1D a re due 
in part to repeated hypo- and hyperglycemic insults , that prolonged improvement of the blood sugars an d 
decreased glycemic variability will create a neurod evelopmental trajectory towards normalization of to tal and 
regional gray and white matter volumes, white matte r microstructure, specific neurocognitive functions , and 
BOLD-fMRI activation patterns.  To accomplish this we will recruit a convenience sample of [ADDRESS_126567] of better glycemic control on  the brain in 
these children.

In addition to procedures noted above, during the s creening visit, a CGM (iPro®, using Enlite sensor, 
Medtronic) will be inserted and worn blindly and co ntinuously for [ADDRESS_126574] is using a Dexcom G5 or equiva lent CGM on a regular basis (at least 21 of 28 days  prior), 
the blinded CGM step can be skipped.  A cognitive t est and MRI/fMRI will be scheduled and completed pr ior to 
the baseline visit (details below). Whenever possib le cognitive and structural studies should be compl eted 
within 4 weeks of each other.  
 
4.2.1 Randomization 
Randomization visit can be conducted on the same da y as the enrollment visit.  Participants whose 
eligibility has been verified will be randomly assi gned to one of 2 treatment arms: 
 The Standard Care arm -   Participants will continue in whatever insulin program they were 
prior to the study. They will be expected to count carbohydrates, monitor BG levels, take insulin 
before meals and as needed, wear home CGM (if appli cable) and adjust basal rates and 
boluses doses as routine.  
 The Hybrid  Closed-Loop arm  - Subjects randomized to the CL arm will be provid ed a 
Medtronic 670G® hybrid closed-loop insulin pump usi ng a loaner system from Medtronic. This 
system can also be prescribed to be purchased as pe r their insurance if the family wishes. . The 
loaner devices will be provided through the 6 month s of the study and the switch to the patient’s 
NEMOURS CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER  
 
 PAGE 20  OF 39 device (if purchased) can occur at the 6 month visi t, unless device available before the study 
and family wishes to use it for the duration of the  study.  
4.3 Baseline Visit: Subjects will come back and have the CGM downloaded  and compliance with all study 
procedures, MRI and cognition included, will be rev iewed.  A series of questionnaires including the IN SPI[INVESTIGATOR_113425], and Fear of Hypoglycemia Survey  will be administered to the subject and/or parent as 
appropriate. If there has been more than [ADDRESS_126575] Care arm  - Participants will return for a 3 and 6-month vis it for routine clinic visit, adverse event 
(AE) assessment and blinded CGM insertion (if a CGM  device is not already used as standard care). Stud y 
subjects will be required to calibrate the blinded CGM minimally every 12 hours. More calibrations may  be 
required. After 6 days of blinded CGM wear an overn ight shippi[INVESTIGATOR_113426] t he CGM 
components and the study meter back to the clinical  center. Once the CGM has downloaded, if the partic ipant 
did not obtained sufficient data, they may be asked  to return to the clinical center for an additional  blinded 
CGM insertion and another 6 day wear. Phone/electro nic contact [CONTACT_113453]. 
The Hybrid Closed-Loop arm  - Participants will initially use the 670G in manu al-mode with the sensor-
augmented function-only activated for 7 days (witho ut using the threshold suspend, predicted low gluco se 
suspend or other hybrid closed-loop features of the  pump).  Subjects transitioning from multiple daily  injections 
(MDI) will have an extra week of wear prior to acti vation of the auto mode to allow proficiency in pum p use.   
This is a procedure recommended by [CONTACT_3455]  (Medtronic) during routine initiation of the devic e.  They 
will calibrate the sensor 3-4 times a day and conti nue to monitor BG levels as routine. Participants w ill receive 
the following recommendations for use of the 670G i n manual-mode :  
• High Set up Limit recommend to be set at 300 mg/dL   
• Low Set up Limit recommend to be set at 70 mg/dL ( not lower than 65mg/dL). Alert Setting Options may 
be set per investigator discretion  
• Predictive alerts and rate of change alerts are op tional  
• It is recommended (optional) to have the SmartGuar d Low Management turned ON with suspend before 
low activated and a low limit set at 70 mg/dL  
• Basal insulin rate setting in Manual mode may need  to be adjusted due to changes in insulin sensitivi ty 
when using Auto Mode.  
Study subjects will return to the clinical center a fter ~7-[ADDRESS_126576] Medtronic for technical support for the 607G hybrid 
closed-loop system as per routine.

needed. The following procedures will be performed in both groups at each visit, unless otherwise 
specified 
      5.1.1: 1-week visit: For participants randomi zed to the hybrid  closed-loop arm only : 
Participants will be allowed to enter auto-mode aft er 1 week of use in the manual mode. Additional tra ining on 
the 670G in the auto-mode  setting will be provided. The following auto-mode settings will be recommended: 
 High BG Setup limit -  300 mg/dL  
 Low Setup limit - 70 mg/dL (not lower than 65mg/Dl ) 
 Target BG for the hybrid  closed-loop algorithm is set at 120 mg/dL  
 A temporary target may be used when subject exerci ses; up to 150 mg/dL 
 Alarm settings fixed into the system are: sensor g lucose ≤50 mg/dL, ≥ 300mg/dL for 1 hour and/or ≥ 250 
mg/dL for 3 hours; settings can be adjusted as need ed at the discretion of the investigator  
 
Follow up visits and phone/electronic (on line) con tacts will be scheduled. 
     5.1.2:   3-month visit (both groups) 
• HbA1c via finger stick using DCA 2000 or equivalen t NGSP-certified point-of-care method or venous 
blood sample at a local laboratory (value within 2 weeks prior to enrollment acceptable) 
• Collection of total daily insulin dose and basal/b olus amounts 
• Physical exam Including anthropometrics and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) 
• Urine pregnancy test on females post menarche 
 
For Standard Care participants only:   Placement of blinded CGM. If participant is curre ntly using a 
DexCom CGM as standard care and has collected at le ast [ADDRESS_126577] 28 days of data, this step 
can be skipped and the unblinded data from the part icipants CGM will be used for the 3-month CGM 
data collection. 
 
For closed-loop arm participants only: The Medtronic 670G hybrid closed-loop insulin pump will be 
downloaded and data will be reviewed for auto-mode usages and glucose trends.  Additional training 
may be provided as needed. The goal is to achieve a t least 70% of time in range (70-180 mg/dl), less 
than 3% of values <70 mg/dl, and at least 70% of th e time in automode.  
 
      5.1.3:  6-month visit (both groups) 
Same as 3 month visit plus:  
• Pertinent QoL questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_113454] 
• MRI, fMRI and cognitive testing will all be schedu led and repeated 
 
For hybrid  closed-loop arm participants only: The Medtronic 670G hybrid closed-loop insulin pump will be 
downloaded. If subjects wear a loaner pump, it will  be returned to the study center and the subjects u sual care 
(either insulin pump or MDI will be restarted).  All 670G related supplies; Enlite-3 glucose sensors , Guardian 
transmitter, infusion sets and insulin cartridges w ill be returned if they were loaned to participants .

of the study.  
• One week after study termination to assess a smoot h transition to subsequent diabetes care. 
During these contacts for participants randomized t o the hybrid closed-loop arm we will assess time in  auto 
mode and trouble shoot technical problem that may h ave occurred. Trends for hypo and hyper glycemia an d 
nocturnal hypoglycemia will also be assessed. Any A Es or serious AEs (SAE)s will also be assessed.  
Participants on standard care will be contact[CONTACT_113456]. Additiona l phone 
contacts in either group may be performed as needed . 
 
 
5.3 Early Termination Visit (if applicable) 
If a participant is withdrawn by a clinician or dec ides to withdraw from the study prior to the 6 mont h visit, 
he/she will be asked to return to the clinical cent er for a close out visit at which time all study de vice(s) or 
supplies will be returned. Repeat structural and fu nctional studies will depend on time of the withdra wal and will 
require discussion with Nemours clinical coordinati ng center.

5.5 Participant Access to Medtronic 670G hybrid clo sed-loop insulin pump at Study Closure 
The Medtronic 670G hybrid closed-loop insulin pump is FDA approved for ages 14 and older. Participants  who 
do not use the system during the study can obtain a  prescription from their physician and submit to th eir 
insurance carrier for purchase of the device commer cially. 
Chapter 6: Prohibited Medications, Treatments, and Procedures 
Acetaminophen use  
Use of medications containing acetaminophen during the study period can affect sensor accuracy hence t heir 
use during the use of a closed-loop device discoura ged. If medications containing acetaminophen are ta ken, 
participant should take additional BG meter reading s to verify glucose levels, and exit Auto Mode for a period 
of time (at least 6 hours) at the discretion of the  investigator/care giver.  
 
Chapter 7:  Medtronic MiniMed 670G System Component s 
 
7.1 Insulin pump:  Medtronic MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump (MMT-1780):  Wh en used with the CGM 
components (Enlite 3 Sensor, GST3C), the pump syste m is capable of continuous or periodic monitoring o f 
glucose levels in the subcutaneous interstitial flu id and detection of hypo- and hyperglycemia.  When Auto 
Mode is enabled, the sensor glucose values received  from the GST3C by [CONTACT_113457] 5min intervals to achieve target glycemic 
control. In both Auto-mode and open-loop (manual) m odes, participants will need to bolus manually for all 
meals and snacks by [CONTACT_113458].   
 
7.2 Guardian Link (GST3C) Transmitter (MMT-7811):   This transmitter has a new internal electronics and  
firmware which reads the electronic signal generate d by [CONTACT_42565]. The transmitter contains a custom 
Application Specific Integrated Circuit which enabl es Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, the latt er used 
as diagnostics for the sensor, which are incorporat ed into the sensor calibration logic. The transmitt er also 
contains the sensor calibration algorithm that conv erts the sensor signal to a sensor glucose value us ing 
calibration glucose values from a meter relayed to the transmitter through the pump. The transmitter t ransmits 
the calculated glucose data to the pump via 2.4GHz RF technology. The new algorithm is designed to imp rove 
and optimize performance when paired with the Enlit e 3 Sensor. Some elements of the new calibration lo gic 
include prompting the user to calibrate when needed , referred to as “Smart Cal,” instead of strictly s cheduled 
time-based calibration requirements.

signal current at a level that is within the range of an in-vivo  sensor during normal operation. 
 
7.4 Medtronic MiniMed Guardian 3  Glucose Sensor (M MT-7020 : The Enlite 3 Sensor contains a 
microelectrode with a thin coating of glucose oxida se beneath several layers of biocompatible membrane , 
designed for improved accuracy. It penetrates the s kin at a 90° angle using an introducer needle and i s shorter 
and thinner than previous generations of sensors. T he sensor continuously converts interstitial fluid glucose into 
an electronic signal received by a transmitter or r ecorder the strength of which is proportional to th e blood 
glucose. The electrode is composed of embedding, si gnal-conducting and insulating layers.  
 
7.5 One-press Serter:  A Click Serter will be used for insertion and is i ntended as a single patient, non-sterile, 
multi-use device.  
7.6 Contour Next Link 2.4 Glucose Meter:  The Contour Next Link 2.4 Wireless Blood Glucose M onitoring 
System is an over the counter (OTC) device utilized  by [CONTACT_113459], and is for s ingle patient use only. The Contour Next Link 2.[ADDRESS_126580] S trips 
are intended for self-testing by [CONTACT_113460] 20 to 600 mg/dL. We may use either thi s meter or another FDA approved meter for BG checks .

9.3. Pump Failure 
If there is a complete failure of the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop insulin pump operations and it i s 
anticipated it will take more than 1-2 hours to res tore, participants may revert to usual care using t heir own 
insulin pump or insulin injections until the 670G c an be brought back on line with the help of study s taff and/or 
manufacturer’s customer support. Every effort will be made to correct the problem as soon as possible.   
 
9.4 Hypoglycemia Threshold Alarm and Safety Protoco l 
Study participants will be permitted to change the low glucose threshold alarm setting, but will be in structed to 
choose a value no less than 65 mg/dL. If a particip ant receives a CGM hypoglycemia threshold alarm or notes 
that the CGM glucose is below the hypoglycemia thre shold alarm value, confirmatory fingerstick testing  will be 
performed if required by [CONTACT_113461] ~15-[ADDRESS_126584]-acting oral glucose.

If a participant’s CGM reading is ≥300 mg/dL when fasting in the morning, >300 mg/dL f or over 1 hour during 
the day, or ≥400 mg/dL at any point, he/she should take the foll owing steps: 
• Perform a blood glucose meter check. 
• If BG  >300 mg/dL, urine ketones should be measure d and correction insulin bolus may be taken per 
the participant’s usual routine. 
• Participants may be instructed to change their pum p site if appropriate

10.[ADDRESS_126585] compatibility of the new imaging data. Two  task-based, and one resting state fMRI task are ut ilized to 
identify the neural substrates of cognitive differe nces between populations (see below).   
10.1.[ADDRESS_126586] preparation and testing schedule:  Subject preparation methods to be used in the propo sed 
grant period have been highly successful in ≥90% of even younger children [21] .  Those children recruited from 
the current study will have had 2-[ADDRESS_126587] in sulin titration to achieve BG targets between 70 to  <200mg/dL 
overnight if possible. The morning of the study a l ow carbohydrate breakfast will be recommended. BG t arget 
will be 70 to <200mg/dL at the initiation and durat ion of the scan. Participant BG can be titrated as needed to 
meet these targets at the discretion of the study s taff and investigator.    
10.1.2 Scan Sequences:  Parallel imaging is used when appropriate to minim ize scan duration and head 
movements. Structural scans: Sagittal MPRAGE (voxel  size 1mm 3) and T2-FLAIR, voxel size 0.9x0.9x3 mm 3 
(for possible white matter abnormalities); DTI: Axi al EPI, 30 directions, voxel size 2mm 3; fMRI: BOLD-sensitive 
volumes are acquired with a gradient-echo imaging p ulse sequence, 36 interleaved 4-mm thick slices, 
3.0×3.0×4 mm 3 voxels. Cumulative imaging time for scans describe d above, including localizers and (if needed) 
repeated MPRAGE and DTI scans is 57 min, total sess ion time of 75 min including set-up and breaks.  
10.1.3 Multisite Imaging:  All sites use a Siemens 3T Tim Trio scanner with i dentical [ADDRESS_126588] sequences. A traveling human phantom is sca nned at every site to confirm replicability of meas urements 
across sites. Quarterly scans of a plastic phantom are used to monitor possible temporal variations in  scan 
quality at each site. Functional MR image quality i s measured with scans of an agar phantom [73] , and 
continuously monitored using subject fMRI data [74] . Human phantoms will be rescanned annually if quali ty 
monitoring detects significant changes in scanner p erformance. Image data will be transmitted to the I DCC using 
protocols to safeguard protected health information . Image data will be reviewed by a site neuroradiol ogist, and 
image quality noted within 48 hours by [CONTACT_113463].  
10.1.4 functional MRI Tasks:  Response inhibition (prefrontal function)  will be measured in a rapid jittered event 
related Go-No-Go task featuring a series of letters  [75]. Subjects push a button in response to all le tters, except 
for the infrequent letter ‘X’. This task is a class ic test of one facet of executive function, requiri ng effortful inhibition 
of a prepotent response [76] . The task presents 300 Go and 75 NoGo stimuli (4:1 ratio) over the course of two 
runs with the inter-trial interval jittered from 2- 12 seconds. Visual-spatial working memory (VSWM) (p refrontal-
parietal) will be assessed with an N-back task suit able for children [77].  Briefly, the VSWM task con sists of a 
single run of 6 alternating 35-s WM (3 1-back and 3  2-back) blocks and 6 35-s control blocks. During 1 -back 
blocks, participants press a button if an “O” appea rs in the same position on 2 consecutive trials. Du ring 2-back 
blocks (the WM condition of interest), button is pr essed if  “O” appeared in the same position 2 trial s previously. 
During control blocks, button is pressed “O” appear s at the center of the screen. In any block, subjec ts view the 
letter ‘‘O’’ once every 2s, at one of 9 screen loca tions, and 1/[ADDRESS_126589]’s

(www.pstnet.com) will be used to present the task a nd collect responses. Preliminary review of fMRI sc an quality 
collected from approximately one-half of our curren t cohort indicates ≥ 85% usable data.  
10.1.5 Image Processing and Analysis:  Primary image processing methods will be identical  to those used for 
our current DirecNet analyses to enhance longitudin al inferences. Additional details/analyses are give n below. 
 Structural:  MPRAGE data will be analyzed using longitudinal VBM  and pre-processed using the VBM 
toolbox in FSL (v5.0, http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). F ollowing skull removal, images will be segmented in to white 
matter, gray matter, and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_113427] 
(http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FAST). Segme nted images are used to create a study-specific gra y matter 
template. Individual subjects’ gray matter maps are  then non-linearly reregistered to the study-specif ic 
average template, modulated using the Jacobian of t he warp field, and smoothed using a full-width half -
maximum (FWHM) of 7 mm. Regional volumetric differe nces will be investigated based on the general line ar 
model (GLM), and corrected for multiple comparisons  using FWE. Cortical thickness, curvature, and regi onal 
surface area will be investigated using longitudina l FreeSurfer (v6.0), which reconstructs the gray/wh ite and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_113428] [78, 79]. Multivariate pattern analyses wil l be 
applied to VBM and Freesurfer data to identify glob al spatial characteristics (across voxel volumes or  surface 
vertices) not apparent in mass univariate analyses [80, 81] . Extracted ROI data will be analyzed using linear 
mixed effects models in SPSS.   
 DTI:  Data will be preprocessed using DTIPrep to generate  voxel-based maps of FA , RD, and AD over the 
whole brain. Resulting maps will be fed into FSL (w ww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/) for voxelwise analyses usin g Tract-
based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) [82]. TBSS data wil l be submitted to voxelwise regression statistics a nd 
corrected for multiple comparisons using permutatio n analysis implemented in FSL (“randomise”) [83]. G LMs 
will be used to perform between-group comparisons, and for correlations between WM structure, clinical  
severity, and behavioral measures. Further, we will  use GLM-based procedures and the FSL “randomise” 
function to investigate longitudinal changes in WM structure. A complementary  a priori region-of interest 
analysis will be conducted using Tracts Constrained  by [CONTACT_113464] (TRACULA) software [84].    
 fMRI:  Data will be pre-processed in FSL using FEAT (FMRI  Expert Analysis Tool), Version 4.1.4. Images will 
first be realigned and motion-adjusted to compensat e for small head movements [85]. Data will be spati ally 
smoothed using a [ADDRESS_126590] for 
baseline drift and high frequency noise [86]. Funct ional datasets are individually registered to parti cipants’ 
T1-weighted structural image using a 6-parameter tr ansformation, then to Montreal Neurological Institu te 
(MNI) template space using FNIRT (FMRIB's Non-linea r Image Registration Tool). Participant motion, 
estimated using MCFLIRT (fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsl wiki/MCFLIRT6D) and the “fsl_motion_outliers” progr am 
http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLMotionOutl iers) will be entered as nuisance regressors for al l fMRI 
analyses.  Resting-state functional connectivity  differences will be examined by [CONTACT_113465]: (1) hypothesis-driven seed-based analyses w ith locations defined by [CONTACT_113466] l data 
and previous studies in adult T1D [87], and (2) dat a-driven  dual-regression and group independent 
component analyses (ICA) using temporally concatena ted data obtained from both groups [88]. Task-based 
functional activation  differences will also be examined using FSL. Becau se multiple runs are conducted for 
each participant for the Go-No-Go task, time-series  statistical analyses will be carried out at a sing le-run 
intrasubject level using a generalized linear model  that models the Go and No-Go epochs (binned separa tely 
according to accuracy) using a synthetic hemodynami c response function and its first derivative. To te st our 
main hypotheses regarding an effect of intervention  on BOLD responses of brain regions subserving 
response inhibition, a direct comparison of correct  No-Go versus correct Go trials will be modeled at the 
single subject level. Single-run intrasubject maps will then be taken to a multiple-run fixed-effects intrasubject 
level to provide subject-specific summaries of acti vation maps which will then be carried to higher-le vel 
intergroup analyses using FMRIB's Local Analysis of  Mixed Effects (FLAME; [86] to assess a main effect  of 
group. Analyses of VSWM fMRI data will be carried o ut by [CONTACT_113467] 1-and [ADDRESS_126591] level. Comparisons of 1 and 2-ba ck vs. match-center blocks will be done, and subjec t-
specific activation summary maps will be carried to  higher-level intergroup analyses using FLAME. All fMRI 
NEMOURS CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER  
 
 PAGE 26  OF 39 analyses will control for participant age and gende r and will include site to permit the estimation of  scanner 
effects [89]. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to assess longitudinal changes. Whole-brain statist ical 
results will be corrected for multiple comparisons using FWE. Linear mixed effects models within SPSS will 
be used to investigate the association of cognitive  scores with BOLD-fMRI metrics for a priori  defined ROIs 
[90].  
10.2 Neurocognitive Testing: All subjects will be administered a similar test ba ttery to the one utilized in our 
current study. These specific measures align with h ypothesized function of “vulnerable” brain regions (as 
suggested by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional anatomic findings in T 1D) to as great a degree as possible, e.g., neuroco gnitive 
metrics reflecting frontal, parietal-occipi[INVESTIGATOR_113429]). The Design Memory task from the 
WRAML-2 was selected to assess hippocampal function  in light of the significantly smaller CA1-3 subfie lds (i.e., 
“deflation”) found in T1D relative to controls. Cog nitive domains of interest also include spatial cog nition, epi[INVESTIGATOR_6368], executive function (e.g., response inhibiti on, working memory) and processing speed. Overall, cognitive 
tests for inclusion in the assessment battery were selected based on prior empi[INVESTIGATOR_113430] e following 
criteria: 1)  strength of effects of T1D on the domain of cognit ive function assessed by [CONTACT_113468]; 2)  strength 
of reliability/validity of the instrument and appro priateness for the targeted age range; 3)  sensitivity of the 
measure to cognitive functions subserved by [CONTACT_113469] d neuroanatomical regions in T1D; 4)  other theoretical or 
conceptual reasons for anticipating an effect of T1 D on the measured cognitive process; 5)  feasibility of test 
administration across the age range; and 6)  burden of measurement and ease of maintenance of p rocedural 
consistency across sites (see Table 3). Trained ind ividuals who administer the neuropsychological test s at each 
site are already certified as proficient by [CONTACT_113470]. Behavioral data from the fMRI tas ks will provide 
additional cognitive data regarding spatial cogniti on and executive functions.   
10.2.1 Cognitive Testing Procedures:  Testing will occur when the child is rested, healt hy and alert. Testing 
will be rescheduled if severe symptomatic hypoglyce mia occurs the night prior. A fingerstick BG level will be 
obtained from subjects with T1D prior to testing us ing a home glucose monitor and titrated to be withi n 70-< 200 
mg/dL within 60min of test initiation. Insulin or f ood will be given at the discretion of the investig ator and 
parent/guardian to achieve this goal. Ketones will be evaluated if BG >200 mg/dL and if positive, the child will be 
treated and testing cancelled. If symptoms of hypog lycemia occur during testing, glucose levels will b e tested 
and BG titrated again to 
70 to <200mg/dL, then 
testing resumed. BG will 
be rechecked at the end 
of the session. If a 
parent/guardian has 
diabetes, a fingerstick 
BG will be obtained to 
verify it is within 70- <200 
mg/dL and titrated by [CONTACT_113471], if out of range 
testing will be 
rescheduled. Testers will 
be blinded to the history 
of BG control of the subjects but not their diagnos is.

Chapter 12: Statistical Considerations 
12.1 Power Estimation  
Due to funding limitations we are conducting this a s a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof of concept study. Primary outcomes  for this 
study are the trends in total and regional GM and W M volumes and white matter microstructure (FA). Sec ondary 
outcomes are the trends in changes in BOLD-fMRI and  neurocognitive metrics. We employed mixed effects 
modeling for our power estimation considering the r epeatedly measured outcomes (pre and post) with the  
projected missing data rate. We assumed ~15% attrit ion between the pre- (T4 from ongoing longitudinal study) 
and post-treatment (T5) assessments. Further, to ma ximize the statistical power given the moderate siz e of our 
sample, we will utilize the longitudinal data from the previous study, which will enable us to analyze  five repeated 
measures instead of two (i.e., 3 from the previous study and 2 that will be measured in the proposed s tudy). 
Given this richer longitudinal data, we conservativ ely assumed reliability of 0.75 for the structural measures 
(primary outcomes). As a lower bound of clinically meaningful outcome, we assumed an effect size of d= 0.[ADDRESS_126593]-treatment assessment. We will randomly assign 50 T1D subjects to the CL (N=25) and Standard Care 
(N=25) after the pre-treatment assessment (T4). Und er this scenario, using the proposed mixed effects modeling 
using pi[INVESTIGATOR_113431] (i.e., 3 pri or and 2 current measures), the estimated power to detect 
treatment effect (intention to treat) is 0.83 (two- tailed, α=.05). Given the preliminary nature of the proposed  study, 
we did not adjust the significance level for multip le testing in our power estimation. However, in act ual data 
analyses, if our primary outcome measures turn out to be highly correlated, we will formulate summary measures 
(either using average or using factor analytic meth ods) or adjust for multiple testing of interrelated  outcomes. For 
the secondary outcomes, we will monitor both effect  sizes and p-values, with more emphasis on gatherin g 
information on effect sizes.  
12.2 Statistical Analysis Plan 
Dependent variables include  total and regional GM and WM volumes, WM microstruc ture, BOLD activation and 
selected neurocognitive metrics (executive function , spatial cognition, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], child IQ). Wh ole brain 
image analyses are carried out within the framework  of specialized software (e.g., SPM, FSL) with stri ngent 
correction for multiple comparisons. Each neurocogn itive domain is composed of a set of individual tes t variables 
(Table 3). For each domain, the scaled scores of th e test variables will be averaged, creating a compo site score.  
Univariate summaries of each dependent variable fro m imaging ROI and neurocognitive data will be given  for 
the HCL and Standard conditions stratified by [CONTACT_113472] (as sub-analy sis). We 
will calculate a composite A1c history measure by t he incremental area >6.0% and CGM glycemic indices.  To 
reduce multiple comparisons, analysis of CGM indice s will be restricted to one measure each of hypogly cemia 
(% CGM <70 mg/dL), hyperglycemia (%>250 mg/dL), eug lycemia (% between 70-180 mg/dL) and glycemic 
variation (CV). Residual values will be analyzed fo r normal distribution; if highly skewed a transform ation or 
nonparametric analysis will be used. Residual vs. p redicted values plots will assess the assumption of  common 
variance.  
Our primary analysis strategy is longitudinal mixed  effects modeling [92, 93], where each targeted bra in ROI and 
neurocognitive metric is compared between the rando mized groups (hybrid closed-loop and Standard) full y 
utilizing repeatedly measured outcomes (i.e., pre a nd post randomization plus three prior measures). 
Specifically, we will utilize a pi[INVESTIGATOR_113432] (T1 to T3) 
and the proposed study period (T4 and T5, or pre/po st) as two longitudinal stages. The analyses will b e 
conducted in line with the intent-to-treat principl e utilizing all available information based on maxi mum likelihood 
estimation.  
 
Scores from the surveys and questionnaires will als o be analyzed using mixed effects modeling, althoug h only 
two repeated measures (i.e., pre and post randomiza tion) will be available for these analyses. Given t he 
NEMOURS CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER  
 
 PAGE [ADDRESS_126594] of the CL use for those who would properly comply w ith the 
treatment assignment (compliers defined as ≥5d wear/week and 5h/night); we will employ a modern  complier 
average causal effect (CACE) estimation [19, 21, 24 , 47, 52], an approach embedded in our mixed effect s 
longitudinal analysis using the maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm [5]. The strength o f this 
approach is that we analytically separate compliers  from individuals who would insist on taking the hy brid closed-
loop despi[INVESTIGATOR_113433] (always-takers) and individuals who are offere d the 
closed-loop but who do not wish to do it despi[INVESTIGATOR_113434] r best efforts (never-takers). Sensitivity analyses  will be 
conducted to support validity of CACE estimates usi ng alternative sets of identifying assumptions [28,  47]. We 
will conduct exploratory moderator analyses to exam ine the treatment effect heterogeneity. Treatment e ffect 
moderators and/or non-specific outcome predictors, we will use baseline age, total brain volume, and p arental 
IQ and socioeconomic status. Sex differences will a lso be analyzed. We will conduct exploratory mediat or 
analysis to examine the mechanism through which the  intervention achieves its impact. As a key hypothe sized 
mediator, we will focus on HbA1c. For moderator and  mediator investigations, we will employ the MacArt hur 
approach [94, 95] embedded in our mixed effects mod els.  Finally, we will compare the longitudinal tra jectories 
of closed-loop group and the non diabetic subjects,  the latter will not be a part of our randomized st udy, although 
their longitudinal information will be collected (T 1 to T4) in the core grant providing complete age o verlap between 
the groups.  This comparison will provide valuable information on whether and how T1D subjects who use  closed-
loop systems move towards the healthy control group .  
 
12.3 Safety Analyses 
Safety endpoints will be tabulated and analyzed as summary statistics during treatment and/or as chang e scores 
from baselines.  AEs will be coded according to the  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedD RA). Each 
AE will be counted per event, i.e., as often as a n ew epi[INVESTIGATOR_113435]-related process. Information will  also be 
reported about each AE including start date and sto p date.  The statistical procedure(s) that will be used to 
analyze the safety outcomes include:  For binary va riables, Fisher exact tests will be used to compare  treatment 
groups.  For counts, such as the number of severe h ypoglycemic or diabetic ketoacidosis events per par ticipant, 
data will be compared using robust Poisson regressi on or a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test as indicated dependi ng on 
the distribution, and the percentage of participant s with at least one event will be compared using Fi sher’s exact 
test.  All participants will be included in these a nalyses. 
 
12.4 Sub-group analyses 
Subgroup analyses/assessments of effect modificatio n (interaction) will be conducted for the primary o utcomes.  
These analyses will be considered exploratory.  Add itionally, interpretation of the analyses will depe nd on 
whether the overall analysis demonstrates a signifi cant treatment group difference; in the absence of such an 
overall difference, subgroup analyses will be inter preted with caution.  The general approach for thes e 
exploratory analyses are described above in the sta tistical analysis plan section, including complier average 
causal effect estimation and moderator/mediator ana lysis embedded in the mixed effects modeling framew ork 
for the primary analyses.  
 
 
Chapter 13: Adverse Events 
13.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a study partici pant, irrespective of the relationship 
between the adverse event and the device(s) used or  study-related procedures. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  Any untoward medical occurrence that: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73606]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity or substantial disruption of the ability t o conduct 
normal life functions. 
NEMOURS CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER  
 
 PAGE 29  OF 39 • Is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator based on medical judgment (e.g., may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical/s urgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes  
listed above). 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE):  Any SAE that was not previously identified in natu re, severity, 
or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or a pplication), 
or any other unanticipated serious problem associat ed with study participation that relates to the rig hts, safety, 
or welfare of participants (21 CFR 812.3(s)). 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a study partici pant which the device may 
have caused or to which the device may have contrib uted.  
Device Complaints:  A device complication or complaint is something th at happens to a device or related to 
device performance, whereas an AE happens to a part icipant.  A device complaint may occur independentl y 
from an AE, or along with an AE.  An AE may occur w ithout a device complaint or there may be an AE rel ated 
to a device complaint. 
Device Malfunction:  Any failure of a device to meet its performance sp ecifications or otherwise perform as 
intended.  Performance specifications include all c laims made in the labeling for the device.  The int ended 
performance of a device refers to the intended use for which the device is labeled or marketed. (21 CF R 
803.3). 
13.2 Reportable AEs 
These include:  1) SAEs, 2) Adverse Device Effects,  3) AEs occurring in association with a study proce dure, 4) 
severe hypoglycemia as defined below, 5) diabetic k etoacidosis (DKA) as defined below. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_113436].  Skin reactions from  sensor placement are only reportable if severe and /or 
required treatment. Pregnancy occurring during the study will be recorded and patient discontinued fro m the 
study. 
 
13.2.[ADDRESS_126595] is only reportable as an AE when considered severe 
as per the following definition for severe hypoglycemia :  the event required assistance of another person due 
to altered consciousness, and required another pers on to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, o r other 
resuscitative actions.  This means that the partici pant was impaired cognitively to the point that he/ she was 
unable to treat himself/herself, was unable to verb alize his/ her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or 
combative, or experienced seizure or coma.  If plas ma glucose measurements are not available during su ch an 
event, neurological recovery attributable to the re storation of plasma glucose to normal is considered  sufficient 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma  glucose concentration. 
 
13.2.2 Hyperglycemic Events/DKA 
Hyperglycemia not associated with an Adverse Device  Effect is only reportable as an AE when one of the  
following criteria is met:  (1) the event involved DKA, as defined by [CONTACT_113473] (DCCT) and described below, or (2) in the abs ence of DKA if evaluation or treatment was obtained  at a 
health care provider facility for an acute event in volving hyperglycemia or ketosis. 
 
DKA is defined if the following are present: 
• Polyuria, polydipsia, accompanied by [CONTACT_33234], or vo miting; 
• Serum ketones >1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones; 
• Either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15; and 
• Treatment provided in a health care facility for t he above symptoms 
NEMOURS CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER  
 
 PAGE 30  OF 39 All reportable AEs—whether volunteered by [CONTACT_17071], discovered by [CONTACT_113474], 
or detected through physical examination, laborator y test, or other means—will be reported on an AE fo rm 
online.   
13.2.[ADDRESS_126596] be repor ted to the Nemours Clinical Coordinating Center wit hin 
24 hours via completion of the online serious adver se event form. Other reportable AE and device malfu nctions 
(with or without an AE) will be reported within [ADDRESS_126597] inating Center becomes aware of the event. Each sit e PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_3411]-related AEs and abiding by [CONTACT_113475]’s Institutional Review Board. 
In the case of a CGM device malfunction, the site’s  coordinator should be notified and information wil l be 
forwarded to the given company supplying the device .  
 
Chapter 14: Sources of Materials, Recruitment and Informed Cons ent Procedures  
 
14.1  Research material : It includes: 1) medical information about the sub jects obtained from interviews, physical 
examinations, laboratory studies (e.g., HbA1c), and  medical records; 2) information about blood and se nsor 
glucose levels downloaded from the CGM devices and the home glucose meters as well as home glucose log s 
and diaries; 3) data from insulin infusion devices;   4) magnetic resonance imaging data and 4) 
neuropsychological study results from the parent gr ant longitudinal study. Subjects will be assigned u nique 
identification numbers, and those participating in the parent grant will retain the same ID number, so  that 
collected research data and specimens can be de-ide ntified but still associated with the data from the  parent 
grant if appropriate.  All data connected to the st udies will be collected in an electronic format acc essible only by 
[CONTACT_113476].  Comput ers will be physically secured and hard copy data w ill be 
stored in locked cabinets in the office of the stud y personnel.  All data analyses and reporting will be performed 
on de-identified data in accordance with the IRB an d Health Insurance Portability and Accountability A ct (HIPAA).  
Study information will be held in strict confidenti ality, accessible only to study personnel, except a s required by 
[CONTACT_113477]. All gluco se data will be stored by [CONTACT_113478] h Research 
servers and the imaging and cognitive data at the S tanford Imaging and Data Coordinating Center (IDDC) ; basic 
demographic information will be shared between the [ADDRESS_126598] re-studied 74% of the original cohort and successfully replaced 26% of th ose lost 
by [CONTACT_113479]. There is a great deal of interest in transitioning to closed-loop technologies so we exp ect no difficulty 
identifying the proposed number of subjects (20 per  site) willing to transition to closed-loop pumps e ither at the 
beginning or after 6 months into the study. A summa ry of the number of ~patients with T1D followed at each site 
is in the table 4 below.

 PAGE 31  OF 39 14.3 Informed Consent Procedures 
The principal investigators, co-investigators, or s tudy coordinators at each center will introduce thi s study to 
eligible subjects and their caretakers during routi ne medical or research visits or in the form of a m ailing or phone 
call.  Prospective subjects/caretakers will have a face-to-face meeting with the investigator and/or s tudy 
coordinator to address questions about the study ra tionale, procedures, risks and benefits. In order t o identify 
and clarify any misconceptions, parents/caretakers will be encouraged to describe the research procedu res and 
their associated risks in their own words, followed  by [CONTACT_113480].  All subjects will be between 14  and <18 years old at the time they are enrolled in this  study.  Written 
informed consent will be obtained from the parents/ caretakers; assent will be obtained from minor subj ects 
according to local IRB guidelines, the study will b e explained to them in age-appropriate terms.  The 
parents/caretakers of subjects will be encouraged t o ask questions and will be clearly informed about the time 
required for these studies and their rights of non- participation and/or withdrawal.  Caretakers/parent s will be 
given copi[INVESTIGATOR_113437].  Since  personal health information will be collected as p art of this 
research protocol, parents/caretakers will also be asked for authorization to collect this information  in accordance 
with HIPAA and IRB guidelines. As mandated by [CONTACT_113481] N IH guidelines the contact [CONTACT_976] (N Mauras) will work w ith 
the Jaeb Center for Health Research (JCHR) to estab lish a single central IRB with all participating si tes. All sites 
already have established reciprocity reliance agree ments between the JCHR’s central IRB and each parti cipating 
site’s IRB, hence a single centralized Human Subjec ts review informed consent process will be maintain ed. The 
Nemours Clinical Coordinating Center will be in cha rge of this process of submission. Each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_17027] l be 
responsible to upload needed materials to their own  IRB as information and abide by [CONTACT_779]-specific mandates 
of their reciprocity agreements. 
 
Chapter 15: Potential Risks of the Study  
Subjects in these studies have T1D and will therefo re be at risk for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetic 
ketoacidosis as part of their ongoing disease state ; these risks are already well known to these subje cts and 
their families. Specific additional risks related t o study participation are listed below.  
15.1 Risks of Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) and  insulin infusion sets:  There is a low risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin infection at the site of th e sensor needle or infusion set placement and itchi ness, redness, 
bleeding, bruising and/or rash may occur, as well a s local tape allergies.  In our prior experience in  DirecNet the 
incidence of infections related to sensor use was v ery low.  Individual readings from CGMs are current ly not 
approved for use in decisions regarding insulin dos ing so subjects will be expected to continue perfor ming 
conventional monitoring of the blood glucose tests at least four times daily.  It should be noted that  all subjects 
enrolled in this project will have had prior experi ence wearing CGM either as part of their routine di abetes care 
and/or as part of their participation in the parent  project.  
15.2 Risks of Magnetic Resonance Imaging:  MRI is generally considered to be safe. MRI can be  harmful if 
the patient's body contains any metal objects.  Sub jects will be screened for metallic objects and are  excluded 
from participation if they have any contraindicatio ns for an MRI. Additionally, the MRI experience can  be 
distressing to young patients if they are not adequ ately prepared.  It should be noted that a % of sub jects enrolled 
in this project will have had prior experience with  MRI as part of their participation in the parent p roject.  
15.[ADDRESS_126600] doesn’t score in the r ange they 
expected. There are no known lasting risks or disco mforts from these testing procedures per se .   
15.4 Risks of Hybrid Closed-Loop Studies 
Hybrid Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery – As stated abo ve under Approach , we will use the commercially available 
Medtronic MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump (MMT-1780 ) which when used with the CGM components (Guardian  3 
NEMOURS CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER  
 
 PAGE 32  OF 39 Sensor, GST3C) continuously monitors interstitial g lucose. When enabling Auto Mode (hybrid closed-loop  
control), the sensor glucose values received from t he GST3C by [CONTACT_113482], at 5 minute intervals, the insulin dose delivered to the patient in order to achieve target  glycemic 
control. This is considered a hybrid system as pati ents will still be required to bolus manually for a ll meals and 
snacks by [CONTACT_113483].   
 
The main potential study-related risks of using thi s hybrid closed-loop system are hypoglycemia, hyper glycemia 
and ketosis/diabetic ketoacidosis, related to perfo rmance properties of the system (inaccuracy of sens ors, 
improper calibration) or malfunctions of the system  (over-delivery or under delivery of insulin, loss of operation 
of the system).  It should be noted that hypoglycem ia, hyperglycemia, and ketosis/DKA are risks alread y familiar 
to all subjects/caretakers in the study, as they ar e risks of standard diabetes management with insuli n pump 
therapy.  Of note, in the recent Medtronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_113438] [ADDRESS_126601] or urination, dehydration and altered mental  status.  
As with hypoglycemia, these symptoms are commonly e xperienced multiple times each week by [CONTACT_113484] T1 
diabetes and will be well known and understood by t hese subjects and their families.  In the absence o f 
ketoacidosis (see below), symptoms of hyperglycemia  pose no immediate risk. The risks of hyperglycemia  are 
potentially mitigated in the CL group by [CONTACT_113485], which supplement insulin delivery in the s etting of 
hyperglycemia, and all subjects in both arms will b e required to test BG at least 4 times daily.  
15.7 Risks Associated with Diabetic Ketoacidosis  
The presence of ketones or diabetic ketoacidosis (D KA) is associated with the risk of dehydration, nau sea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, electrolyte imbalance and  acidosis, shock, coma or death.  DKA is uncommon i s well-
managed diabetes.  All families are knowledgeable a bout prevention of DKA and when to call for assista nce in 
avoiding DKA.  This is a routine part of their clin ical care.  
15.8 Risks of loss of privacy and confidentiality : Collection of research data could pose threats to  privacy 
and confidentiality, potentially jeopardizing patie nts' employability or insurability. Some parents/ca regivers may 
be uncomfortable with the degree of scrutiny of the ir daily diabetes management consequent to use of t he CGM 
sensor and frequent pump downloads.  However, once again, it should be noted that all these subjects h ave 
T1D and most already have experience using insulin pumps and CGM. 
 
Chapter 16: Miscellaneous Considerations  
16.1 Alternative Treatments and Procedures 
The proposed studies are optional and voluntary; th e alternative to participating in them would be not  to 
participate, and just continue routine diabetes car e or start hybrid closed-loop pump treatment as par t of their 
routine care.  The decision not to participate will  in no way affect the ability of the subject to con tinue to receive 
medical and diabetes care at our centers. 
NEMOURS CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER  
 
 PAGE 33  OF 39 16.2 Participant compensation:  This will be detailed in the informed consent docu ment  
16.3 Withdrawal:  Participation in the study is voluntary, and a par ticipant may withdraw at any time.  For 
participants who withdraw, their data collected up until the time of withdrawal will be used. 
16.4 Data Collection and monitoring:  The main study data are collected through a combina tion of electronic 
case report forms (eCRFs) and electronic device dat a files obtained from the study software and indivi dual 
hardware components and stored at the IDCC in the R EDCap system at Stanford University.  When data are  
directly collected in eCRFs, this will be considere d the source data.  Each participating site will ma intain 
appropriate medical and research records for this t rial, in compliance with ICH E6 and regulatory and 
institutional requirements for the protection of co nfidentiality of participants.  
16.5 Records Retention: Study documents should be retained for a minimum of  [ADDRESS_126602] eted and data published.  These documents should be  
retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427].   
16.6 Quality Assurance and Monitoring: The Nemours Clinical Coordinating Center will be re sponsible for 
maintaining quality assurance (QA) and quality cont rol (QC) systems to ensure that the clinical portio n of the 
trial is conducted and data are generated, document ed and reported in compliance with the protocol, Go od 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulato ry requirements.  Adverse events will be prioritize d for 
monitoring. Stanford’s IDCC will be responsible for  maintaining QA and QC of the imaging data as well as the 
repository of all data in the study through REDCap.  The JCHR will be responsible for collecting and 
maintaining all the glucose and insulin data genera ted by [CONTACT_113486]-loop portion of the studie s, as well 
as all glucose downloads in the entire cohort.  Either or both of the clinical and data coordinatin g centers’ 
representatives or their designees may visit the st udy facilities at any time in order to maintain cur rent and 
personal knowledge of the study through review of t he records, comparison with source documents, 
observation and discussion of the conduct and progr ess of the study. 
16.7 Protocol deviations:  A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the  clinical trial protocol, GCP, or 
procedure requirements.  The noncompliance may be e ither on the part of the participant, the investiga tor, or 
the study site staff.  As a result of deviations, c orrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_779] a nd 
implemented promptly. The site PI/study staff is re sponsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB 
requirements.  Further details about the handling o f protocol deviations will be included in the manua l of 
operations. 
16.[ADDRESS_126603]: A [ADDRESS_126604] 
(DSMB) has been established ([CONTACT_113491] – ch air). Protocol will be thoroughly reviewed and appr oved 
prior to study initiation. Quarterly or as needed m eetings will be established to monitor progress, AE s, SAEs, 
protocol deviations and any issues related to the h uman subjects participation in the studies. The com mittee 
has been actively functioning in the parent longitu dinal RO1 for the last [ADDRESS_126605] cons iderable 
latitude on the monitoring of the study progress. 
16.9 Criteria for Suspending Overall Study:  Study activities could be suspended if the manufac turer of any 
constituent study device requires stoppage of devic e use for safety reasons (e.g. product recall).  Th e affected 
study activities may resume if the underlying probl em can be corrected by a protocol or system modific ation 
that will not invalidate the results obtained prior  to suspension. These decisions will be made in con sultation 
with the DSMB and notification to the IRB as approp riate. If there is termination of funding the study  may also 
be suspended. 
16.10 Institutional Review Boards:  The protocol, protocol amendments, informed consen t form(s), 
recruitment materials, and all participant material s will be submitted to the IRB for review and appro val prior to 
participant enrollment. If a central IRB is used, e ach individual center’s IRB should be notified and pertinent 
materials shared locally as per their individual ag reements.

 PAGE 34  OF 39 16.11 Future use of stored specimens: Data collected for this study will be stored and an alyzed at the 
Stanford IDCC.  After the study is completed, the d e-identified, archived data will be transmitted to and stored 
at the IDCC for use by [CONTACT_21227].  Permission to transmit  data to 
the IDCC will be included in the informed consent. With the participant’s and IRB’s approval, de-ident ified 
biological samples will be stored at the Nemours Ch ildren’s Health System Clinic freezers in Jacksonvi lle, FL 
until they are used for research assays.  During th e conduct of the study, an individual participant c an choose 
to withdraw consent to have biological specimens st ored for future research.  However, withdrawal of c onsent 
with regard to biosample storage will not be possib le after the study is completed. When the study is 
completed, access to study data and/or samples will  be provided through the Stanford IDCC.

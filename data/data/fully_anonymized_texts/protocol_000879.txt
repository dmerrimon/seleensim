Study Design: This is a first -in-human (FIH), Phase 1, single -center, prospective, randomized, double -blind 
study of ascending single doses of CD388 Injection administered IM or SQ to healthy adult subjects followed by [CONTACT_871444]388 Injection administered by [CONTACT_860216] [ADDRESS_1217060] dose in the middle and  high dose groups (dosing may be adjusted for 
tolerability) . The goals are  to assess safety, tolerability, immunogenicity  (anti- drug antibodies [ ADA]) , and PK 
of CD388.  
Dose levels of CD388 to be assessed will follow an ascending single dose design with the starting dose based on 
findings from 3 -month rat and  monkey toxicology studies. Within each route (IM and SQ dose, route assignment 
is unblinded), subjects will be ran domized to receive a single dose of CD388 Injection or saline placebo 
(treatment assignment is blinded)  according to the design  in the table below . It should be noted that each cohort 
will be divided into 2 groups identified as “sentinel” groups (randomized 1:1) and “main” groups  (randomized 
7:2):  
• Low dose (50 mg) level: Cohort 1A (IM) and Cohort 1B (SQ) – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• Mid dose (150 mg) level: Cohort 2A (IM) and Cohort 2B (SQ) – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• High dose (450 mg) level: Cohort 3A (IM) and Cohort 3B (SQ) – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• H
ighest  dose ( 900 mg) level: Cohort 4B (SQ) – n = 2 sentinel and n = [ADDRESS_1217061] group of 2 subjects (1 CD388: 1 placebo) at  a dose level  will be administered 
blinded study drug and closely monitored for safety for at least 1 week. The Principal Investigator (PI) 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.[ADDRESS_1217062] completed 
dosing and followed for a minimum of 1 week. If no drug- related SAEs or  drug-related Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1217063] 
occurred, the subjects in the corresponding main group may be dosed within 24  hours . The observation duration 
may be adjusted for the sentinel groups in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 4B  based on data from previous cohorts . 
After all subjects at a dose l evel (for the IM cohorts and SQ cohorts separately) have completed study drug 
administration and have undergone protocol -specified procedures and  assessments for ≥14  days, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_871423], including AEs  (including reactogenicity/injection site reactions 
and hypersensitivity reactions ), vital signs, 12- lead ECG s, and clinical laboratory  results  (including hematology, 
coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis)  to determine the safety and tolerability of the study drug. 
The incidence and severity of AEs, and adverse changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, and ECGs 
will be taken in to consideration when determining safety and tolerability of study drug. Escalation between dose 
levels will be based on review of at least [ADDRESS_1217064] -dose safety data. If  the dose/route  of administration  is 
determined to be safe and well tolerated ≥14 da ys after dosing, the next cohort of subjects will be enroll ed 
and randomized to receive the next higher dose level of CD388 Injection or placebo. The  data cut -off time point 
for data review and dose escalation decision has been adjusted for Cohorts  2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B based on data 
from Cohort s 1A and 1B .

assigned to placebo will remain placebo, and subjects assigned to CD388 will remain CD388) . 
Subjects in Cohorts 1A, 1B , and 4B will receive a single dose of CD388 or placebo.  
Subjects in Cohorts 2A and 2B and Cohorts 3A and 3B will receive a second single dose of CD388 Injection 
or placebo after washout of [ADDRESS_1217065] dose is acceptable upon review of the cumulative safety 
data. Immediately prior to the sec ond single dose, within each dose and route, any dropouts  in the sentinel groups 
will be randomly replaced with subjects from the main groups, retaining their original treatment assignment (i.e., subjects assigned to placebo will remain placebo, and subjects assigned to CD388 will remain CD388; this 
may require unblinded personnel to oversee).

a.Performed at the second administration period only if required to further evaluate observations from
prior peri -dosing period (at the discretion of the Investigator).
Blood PK samples, and blood samples to assess ADA will be collected from all subjects for the purpose of 
maintaining the blind, but only samples from the CD388 Injection group will be analyzed (using validated assays) by [CONTACT_108863]. After discharge from the CRU, additional sample collection for 
PK and ADA will be performed at specified time points after dosing. The timing  of PK sampling has been 
adjusted for Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B  based on data from previous cohorts .
 
Additional blood samples will be collected for pharmacogenomics and exploratory biomarker evaluation, 
and additional blood and urine samples will be collected for exploratory metabolite identification, to be reported 
separately. Plasma samples collected for  PK analysis may also be used for CD388 drug- antibody ratio (DAR) 
distribution and metabolite identification after completion of PK analysis. Nasopharyngeal swabs  will also be 
collected for CD388 exploratory assays. Nasal wash collection will occur during the second single dose at the 
time of C max as determined from the first single dose.  Nasal wash collection for Cohort 4B will occur during 
dosing on Day 7.

Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration  
CD388 Injection is a clear to lightly opalescent liquid essentially free of particulate matter containing the active 
pharmaceutical ingredient, CD388. CD388 Injection is supplied as a frozen sterile solution in single -use vials.  
CD388 Injection is administered by [CONTACT_871446] (IM) or subcutaneous (SQ) injection at the dose described in Table  5, depending upon the subject’s randomization assignment. Dose levels to be assessed will 
follow an  ascending single -dose regimen with the starting dose based on findings from 3- month rat and monkey 
toxicology studies.  
Comparator  
Normal saline will be administered IM or SQ as the placebo control.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 9 of 85 Duration of Treatment  
A single dose of study drug will be administered IM or SQ on Day 1. Study participation will require up to 
28 days for screening procedures, and ~ [ADDRESS_1217075] single dose (check- in to the CRU on Day - 1; CRU 
inpatient stay for study drug administration, observation, and assessments and procedures for 31 days [Days - 1 
to Day 30]; and 4 CRU outpatient visits for additional assessments and procedures).  
Subjects in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B who receive a second single dose will have an additional [ADDRESS_1217076] administration . 
Criteria for Evaluation  
Safety and Tolerability of Study Drug  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_42466]  (including reactogenicity/injection site reactions , 
hypersensitivity reactions,  and adverse events of special interest [AESIs] ), vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs, Holter 
monitoring, clinical laboratory results (including hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), 
and concomitant medication usage throughout the study.   
See the Study Design sectio n for details regarding dose level/cohort enrollment timing  and assessment  of safety 
and tolerability for  dose escalation decision . 
If a dose level is considered not safe or  well tolerated, the  study drug assignment for the subject(s) with the safety 
issue  may be unblinded. The Sponsor may also independently decide to unblind the entire cohort for safety 
concerns or  terminate enrollment for any reason.  
If any subject develops a Grade ≥2 AE  that is deemed related to the study drug, the mechanism of the AE may 
be assessed  (i.e., cytokine level, complement activation, immunoglobulin G [IgG ] subtypes, immunoglobulin E 
[IgE], T-cell/B -cell/monocyte and  basophil activation as assessed by [CONTACT_4133], ADA development, 
and immune complex formation) at Sponsor a nd Investigator discretion , and the study dose and route may be 
modified for the remainder of the study.  
Pharmacokinetics/Anti -drug Antibodies  
Pharmacokinetics will be determined by [CONTACT_108868]388 obtained from subjects  who receive CD388 Injection in each cohort at various time points after administration of  the first 
and second single doses of the study drug. Blood samples collected for PK analysis may also be used for 
metabolite identification after completion of PK an alysis , along with urine samples . Plasma  samples , 
nasopharyngeal swabs , and nasal washes  will be analyzed for the concentration of CD388. Anti -drug antibodies 
(ADA) will also be measured at selected time points by a validated ELISA method.  
Pharmacogenomics  
A mandatory pharmacogenomic (DNA) blood sample will be collected once, preferably on Day 1 (collection at another time point is allowed if necessary) to allow for genetic research to help understand the characteristics of 
CD388. Genetic analysis will be co nducted if it is hypothesized that this may help explore genetic markers that 
could explain differences in safety, immunogenicity, or clinical response among subjects . Host DNA assessment 
will be limited to research related to CD388. They  may also be used to develop tests/assays related to CD388 
and flu-like disease.  
Analyses of host DNA may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately from the study report . 
Exploratory Biomarkers  
Blood samples will be collected to allow for the exploration of biomarkers (such as but not limited to RNA 
or proteins) on the assumption that these markers may play a role in the response  (safety, reactogenicity, 
immunogenicity ) to CD388.  
These samples and r emaining material from other samples may be used for further assay 
optimization/qualification, biomarkers, or  further exploratory analyses. Samples will only be used for research 
related to influenza virus infection, flu -like disease, and safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of CD388. 
They may also  be used to develop tests/assays related to CD388 and influenza . 
Analyses of biomarkers may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately from the study report .

• The Investigator  considers that it is in the subject’s best interest not to continue participation in  the study 
Subject Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_871426], subjects in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B will be followed through Outpatient Visit 4 (OV4)  of the 
first dosing period, and will not receive the second single dose:  
• If the subject develops anaphylaxis  or a related Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE  
• If the subject has a persistent (i.e., >5 days with no response to treatment) Grade ≥ 2 rash considered 
related to the investigational drug by [CONTACT_079] (Appendix 4 ) 
• If the Investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the subject to not receive a second dose.  
• If the subject no longer meets all eligibility criteria prior to the second single do se 
• If the subject becomes pregnant prior to the second single dose  
If a subject is removed from the study for any reason, the subject will be followed for resolution of any ongoing 
AE(s). 
Temporary Study Halt for Safety Review  
The study will be temporarily  halted, pending review of available data, if any of the following occur:   
• If ≥2 subjects experience the same Grade 3 AE event or laboratory abnormality within 28 days after 
study drug administration, considered attributable to CD388 or cannot be attributed to another cause  
(Investigator to consider the potential of IM injections to cause significant transient increases of creatine 
kinase [ CK], when evaluating the potential relatedness of this laboratory abnormality to the 
investigational drug. A  transient CK increase after IM injection is to be considered “ not related ” to the 
study drug.)  
• If ≥[ADDRESS_1217077] experiences a Grade 4 AE or laboratory abnormality within 28 days after study drug 
administration, considered attributable to CD388 or cannot be attributed to another cause  
If it is considered appropriate to restart the study following an internal safety review, a substantial amendment 
will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Institutional Review Board (IRB). The study 
will not restart until the amendment has been approved by [CONTACT_108869].  
Statistical Methods  
Safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. There will be no formal hypothesis testing. Analysis populations are:  
• Safety Population: all subjects who receive any amount of study drug  
• PK Analysis Population: all subjects who receive CD388 Injection and who have any blood samples analyzed  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before unblinding  for th e first interim analysis . 
Any deviations from the final SAP will be described and justified in the study report. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
®. 
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables,  and the numbers, means, 
standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables, will be provided. All data will 
be summarized separately by [CONTACT_15994] , route (IM or SQ), and study drug (CD388 Injection or placebo) . Listings 
of individual subject data will also be produced.

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 11 of 85 Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_871447] A Es and SAEs , ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations 
(hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis ), and vital signs. Adverse events will be coded using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence of TEAEs and AESIs will be 
presented by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT), relationship to study drug, severity, and r oute 
of administration .   
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as follows:  
Cohort  TEAE is an AE  that occurs during or after study drug administration:  
1A, 1B  Through [ADDRESS_1217078] dose of study drug (Day 206 ±10 days)  
In addition,  the incidence of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug or from the 
study will be presented by [CONTACT_71938]. The TEAEs occurring after the first single dose and after the second 
single dose will be analyzed separately. Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory test results , ECG parameters , 
and vital signs, and for changes from Baseline, will be presented by [CONTACT_7206]. The incidences of potentially clinically significant (PCS) clinical laboratory results , ECG parameters , and vital signs will also be summarized 
by [CONTACT_7206].  
A summary of the injection site evaluation will be presented. The number and percentage of subjects with any 
local reaction will be provided , as will the number and percentage of subjects with pain, tenderness , 
erythema/redness , and induration/swelling. The severity of each local reaction will also be presented.  
The PK parameters t hat will be assessed in the PK Analysis Population include:  
• maximum plasma concentration (C
max) 
• time to maximum plasma concentration (T max) 
• terminal elimination half -life (t ½) 
• apparent clearance (CL/F) 
• apparent volume of distribution (V Z/F)  
• area under the plasma concentration- time curve from time [ADDRESS_1217079] quantifiable sample (AUC 0-t) 
• area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞)  
CD388 concentration  in the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_871427] d from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collection  
will be summarized  and reported separately . 
Analysis of the ADA results is to be determined  and may include determination of the subject’s positive/negative 
ADA status at baseline, treatment -emergent ADA in subje cts with a negative baseline, as well as a post -baseline 
increase in titer for subjects with positive ADA at baseline . 
Metabolite identification and profiling, CD388 in urine and nasal wash, CD388 DAR distribution, CD388 
glycoforms, pharmacogenomics, and exploratory biomarkers will be reported separately.  
Two blinded interim analyses  of selected safety and PK data, one for the first dose level and another one for the 
second dose level , are planned for internal decision making or health authority interaction.

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 28 of 85 4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
4.1. Background  
4.1.1. Influenza – Prevention and Treatment  
Globally, millions are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_108829] 650,000 deaths occur due to influenza 
(Iuliano 2018) . In the [LOCATION_002] ( US), an estimated 37 –43 million influenza- related illnesses, 
17– 20 million influenza-related medical visits, 500,000 to 650,000 influenza- related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and 61,000 deaths occurred during the 2018–2019 influenza season (Brammer  2019). These numbers remain high year after year becaus e currently no effective 
medicine is available for the  prevention of influenza. 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the administration of an influenza vaccine yearly for the prevention of influenza, but the efficacy varies yearly due to 
the emergence of new strains. According to the CDC, during the 2018–2019 influenza season, the vaccine was only 29% effective ( Flannery  2019). Vaccines cannot offer complete protection 
because of high genetic diversity between and within influenza A and B types. Additionally, 
rapid antigenic drift and antigenic shift in the virus erodes vaccine durability (necessitating 
development of new vaccines annually), and slow vaccine manufacturing cycles make it difficult to keep pace with constantly mutating seasonal and pandemic viral strains. 
The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir are approved for 
prophylaxis and treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Use of NAI antiviral prophylaxis is recommended to control institutional outbreaks of influenza when used within [ADDRESS_1217100] co-morbidities that predispose them to severe influenza illness. However, when NAIs are used for prophylaxis, even when used promptly 
after a known exposure, the efficacy is only around 70–80% and prolonged use in 
immunocompromised individuals can lead to the emergence of NAI drug resistance 
(Okoli 2014). 
Over the past 20 years there has been increasing concern that highly pathogenic avian strains such as H7N9 and H7N7 can be transmitted to humans causing high fatality rates in a manner similar to that of the H5N1 pandemic strain in 1997. Although the transmission of these avian 
strains to humans has been largely limited to  individuals exposed to poultry, the possibility of 
the emergence of a highly pathogenic and human-adapted influenza variant is concerning 
(Paules  2017). Furthermore, recent modeling predicts that, in the event of a pandemic event 
along the lines of the [ADDRESS_1217101] 6 months before a vaccine could be developed and many millions more would die during the time it would take for the global population to be immunized ( Abbasi 2019). 
Progress towards a medicinal agent that provides protection against a broad range of influenza strains with a longer duration of protection, otherwise known as a “universal vaccine”, has been disappointing. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics developed to date have suffered 
from limited spectrum and commercial limitations due to high dosing requirements  and/or 
the need for multiple antibody cocktails to achieve a desired spectrum and efficacy. Thus, 
a significant unmet need exists for long-acting universal protective agents.

CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 29 of 85 4.1.2. CD388 – A Long -Acting Antiviral Fc -Conjugate 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Cidara) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a novel therapeutic and prophylactic agent that 
has a potential to provide durable single- dose “universal” coverage per flu  season. Cidara has 
replaced variable domains of a monoclonal antibody with multiple copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] a highly potent 
small molecule antiviral agent ( the marketed NAI zanamivir) tailored to target a small, highly  
conserved essential influenza target. This  molecule, CD388, is a first in class long -acting  
antiviral Fc -conjugate (AVC) combining a surface -acting antiviral agent with  the crystallizable 
fragment ( Fc) of a human immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) antibody. 
CD388 differs from traditional antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) molecules in the following aspects:  
• In traditional antibody-drug conjugates the drug is attached to full length human IgG (Fc + antigen -binding fragment [ Fab]); in contrast, zanamivir dimers of CD388 are 
conjugated to an Fc fragment of human IgG1 (and not full length IgG1). 
• In traditional antibody-drug conjugates the drug is conjugated to the human IgG using a protease- cleavable linker to allow release of the drug inside target cells;  the linker 
between zanamivir and the Fc in CD388 is not a substrate for proteases, and it exerts its 
antiviral activity in the extracellular space.  
• Traditional antibody-drug conjugates are used to treat cancer by [CONTACT_871449]; CD388 is designed to treat and prevent infectious disease using a long-acting stable conjugate of a non- cytotoxic small molecule 
to an Fc fragment of IgG1 
In nonclinical in vitro and in vivo models, CD388 has demonstrated the potential for 
significantly higher antiviral activity and efficacy compared to the parent molecule, zanamivir, as well as other NAIs , including oseltamivir.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. CD388 Nonclinical Studies  
Several in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD388 and/or related Fc-conjugated prototype targeting molecule s (TMs) to 
support dosing in humans. In vitro NAI and cell- based assays were conducted with CD388 to 
assess its spectrum and potency against Wild Type (WT) as well as drug -resistant influenza 
strains. In vitro studies to characterize the extent of neonatal crystallizable fragment receptor (FcRn ) and Fc- γ receptor binding across different species were conducted. In vitro studies to 
characterize the potential for resistance development with CD388 have been undertaken. In vivo efficacy of CD388 was observed in treatment, and prophylaxis or preventative mouse lethal infection models. 
In vitro stability of the TM compound alone was quantitatively tested at 37℃  in phosphate-
buffered saline, plasma, and liver microsomes. Stability of the intact Fc-conjugated molecule, 
CD388, was qualitatively observed in liver microsomes at 37℃ . In vivo, th e pharmacokinetics 
were investigated in animal species that were used to characterize the pharmacological 
and toxicological profile of CD388 and related molecules; namely in mouse, rat, and monkey. 
More  importantly, following pharmacokinetic studies in the mouse, rat, and monkey, plasma 
concentrations were quantified by a neuraminidase (NA)- capture or Fc- capture with Fc detection 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 30 of 85 enzyme-linked immunoassay ( ELISA ) methods, to confirm the stability of CD388 in vivo. 
NA-capture/Fc- detection measures the concen tration of intact NA-linked- Fc species while 
Fc-capture/Fc -detection measures the total concentration of Fc- related species. Plasma 
concentrations measured by [CONTACT_871450], suggesting that intact CD388 
remained stable in vivo as designed. 
Single-dose, range-finding intramuscular ( IM) and/or subcutaneous ( SQ) toxicity 
and toxicokinetic studies, with endpoint evaluations occurring over the plasma exposure 
periods of [ADDRESS_1217102] been conducted. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_108830] ( GLP ) toxicity studies include endpoints to assess safety pharmacology 
(i.e., cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and neurobehavioral effects) and toxicokinetics to determine 
safety margins. In addition, screening for anti-CD388 antibodies, cytokine analysis, 
and immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_108831]. These pi[INVESTIGATOR_108832] -in-human ( FIH) studies were designed in accordance with the relevant 
International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) guidance and US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) guidance on safety and toxicology studies for CD388’s predecessor molecule (CD377). 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional nonclinical information. 
4.2. Summary of Benefits and Risks  
This is a FIH  study of CD388 Injection. More detailed information about the known 
and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events ( AEs) may be found in 
the Investigator’s Brochure. 
The risks for the individual subject due to administration of CD388 Injection are consi dered low 
and are outweighed by [CONTACT_163318] a new treatment in an area of high unmet medical 
need. To further minimize any potential risk, all subjects will be closely screened for any 
underlying conditions that may increase risk of study participation. During the conduct of the 
study, subjects are housed in a clinical research unit (CRU) for 30 days after CD388 Injection/placebo administration, under continuous medical supervision.  
4.3. Justification of Dose  
The dose(s) planned for this  study are based on results obtained from GLP 3-month exposure 
toxicology studies in rats and primates, and the FDA’s guidance contained in “ Estimating the 
Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers ” (FDA  2005). 
From the 3-month GLP toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, a no-observed-adverse- effect 
level ( NOAEL ) of 500 mg/kg has been established for both species. CD388 safety margins 
generated from these pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 3-month exposure studies in support of the FIH proposed dose are 
presented in Table 4. At the proposed 50 mg human dose administered as a bolus IM or SQ  
injection, the safety margin based on the 3-month NOAELs and using body surface area ( BSA ) 
is 97-fold in rats and 194-fold in monkeys. Safety margins based on human area under the 
plasma concentration -time c urve ( AUC ) predictions at 50 mg relative to the rat and monkey 
3-month plasma AUC exposures are 166-fold in rats and 581-fold in monkeys.

f. Predicted human plasma PK for 50 mg starting dose (or 0.833 mg/kg based on a 60 kg person): AUC 0-∞ = 3855 µg×h/mL. 
Cmax = 14.4 µg/mL  (calculated from 5 mg/kg IV human PK as reported/projected in NC -CD388 -05). Note: These 
exposures were predicted for IV administration and would represent the highest values  expected as bioavailability from IM 
or SQ administration is anticipated to be approximately 70% of IV based on animal PK studies, potentially lowering the 
exposures in human from IM or S Q dosing.  
 
Safety results from this trial have indicated no significant safety findings following single IM 
or SQ administration of 50, 150 mg, and 450 mg CD388. Regular assessment of blinded 
safety/tolerability data from [ADDRESS_1217103] clinical studies and follow the recommendations in the ICH guidelines. The assessments

Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.[ADDRESS_1217107] dose in the middle and high dose groups (dosing 
may be adjusted f or tolerability ). The goals are to assess safety, tolerability, immunogenicity  
(anti-drug antibodies [ADA]), and PK of CD388. 
Dose levels of CD388 to be assessed will follow an ascending single dose design with the starting dose based on findings from 3-month rat and monkey toxicology studies. Within each 
route (IM and SQ dose, route assignment is unblinded), subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of CD388 Injection or saline placebo (treatment assignment is blinded) according to the design in Table 5. It should be noted that each cohort will be divided into 2 groups identified as “sentinel”  groups (randomized 1:1) and “main” groups (randomized 7:2): 
• Low dose (50 mg) level: Cohort 1A (IM) and Cohort 1B (SQ)  – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• Mid dose (150 mg) level: Cohort 2A (IM) and Cohort 2B (SQ)  – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• High dose (450 mg) level: Cohort 3A (IM) and Cohort 3B (SQ)  – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• H ighest  dose ( 900 mg) level: Cohort 4B (SQ)  – n = 2 sentinel and n = [ADDRESS_1217108] group of 2 subjects (1  CD388: 1 placebo) at a dose level  
will be administered blinded study drug and closely monitored for safety for at least 1 week. 
The Principal Investigator (PI) and Sponsor will review blinded safety data after the initial 
sentinel group subjects at a dose level have completed dosing and followed for a minimum of 
1 week. If no drug- related SAEs or drug- related Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1217109] occurred, the subjects in 
the corresponding main group may be dosed within 24 hours. The observation duration may be adjusted for the sentinel groups in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 4B based on data from previous cohorts. 
After all subjects at a dose level  (for the IM cohorts and SQ cohorts separately) have completed 
study drug administration and have undergone protocol- specified procedures and assessments 
for ≥14 days, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_871423], including A Es (including 
reactogenicity/injection site reactions  and hypersensitivity reactions), vital signs, 12- lead ECG s, 
and clinical laboratory  results (including hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, 
and urinalysis) to determine the safety and tolerability of the study drug. The incidence and 
severity of AE s, and adverse changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, and ECGs will 
be taken into consideration when determining safety and tolerability of study drug. Escalation 
between dose levels will be based on review of at least [ADDRESS_1217110]-dose safety data. If the 
dose/route of administration  is determined to be safe and well tolerate d ≥14 days after dosing, 
the next cohort of subjects will be enroll ed and randomized to receive the next higher dose level 
of CD388 Injection or placebo. The data cut-off time point for data review and dose escalation 
decision has been  adjusted for Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B based on data from Cohorts 1A and

the purpose of maintaining the blind, but only samples from the CD388 Injection group will be 
analyzed (using validated assays) by [CONTACT_108863]. After discharge from the CRU, additional sample collection for PK and ADA will be performed at 
specified time points after do sing. The timing of PK sampling has been adjusted for Cohorts 2A,

Additional blood samples will be collected for pharmacogenomics and exploratory biomarker 
evaluation , and additional blood and urine sampl es will be collected for exploratory metabolite 
identification, to be reported separately. Plasma samples collected for PK analysis may also be 
used for CD388 drug-antibody ratio ( DAR ) distribution and metabolite identification after 
completion of PK analysis. Nasopharyngeal swabs will also be collected for CD388 exploratory assays.  Nasal wash collection will occur during the second single dose at the time of C

6.2. Criteria for Evaluation  
6.2.1. Safety and Tolerability of Study Drug 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_42466] (including reactogenicity/injection site reactions , hypersensitivity reactions, and  adverse events of special interest [AESIs] ), vital 
signs, 12- lead ECGs , Holter monitoring , clinical laboratory results (including hematology, 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 38 of 85 coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), and concomitant medication usage throughout the 
study. 
See Section  6.1 for details regarding dose level/cohort enrollment timing and assessment of 
safety and  tolerability for dose escalation decisi on. 
If a dose level is considered not safe or well tolerated, the study drug assignment for the 
subject(s) with the safety issue may be unblinded. The Sponsor may also independently decide 
to unblind the entire cohort for safety concerns or terminate enrollment for any reason. 
If any subject develops a Grade ≥ 2 AE that is deemed related to the study drug, the mechanism 
of the AE may be assessed (i.e., cytokine level, complement activation, immunoglobulin G [IgG] subtypes, immunoglobulin E [ IgE], T-cell/B -cell/monocyte and  basophil activation as 
assessed by [CONTACT_4133], ADA development, and immune complex formation) at Sponsor and Investigator discretion, and the study dose and route may be modified for the remainder of 
the study. 
6.2.2. Pharmac okinetics/Anti- drug Antibodies  
Pharmacokinetics will be determined by [CONTACT_108868]388 
obtained from subjects who receive CD388 Injection in each cohort at various time points after administration of  the first and  second single doses of the study drug. Blood samples collected for 
PK analysis  may also be used for metabolite identification after completion of PK analysis, along 
with urine samples . Plasma samples , nasopharyngeal swabs, and nasal washes  will be analyzed 
for th e concentration of CD388. Anti- drug antibodies (ADA) will also be measured at selected 
time points by a validated ELISA method. 
6.2.3. Pharmacogenomics 
A mandatory pharmacogenomic (DNA) blood sample will be collected once, preferably on 
Day 1 (collection at another time point is allowed if necessary) to allow for genetic research to 
help understand the characteristics of CD388. Genetic analysis will be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help explore genetic markers that could explain differences in safety, immunogenicity, or clinical response among subje cts. Host DNA assessment will be limited to 
research related to CD388. They may also be used to develop tests/assays related to CD388 and flu-like disease.  
Analyses of host DNA may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately from the s tudy report. 
6.2.4. Exploratory Biomarkers 
Blood samples will be collected to allow for the exploration of biomarkers (such as but not limited to RNA or proteins) on the assumption that these markers may play a role in the response (safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity ) to CD388. 
These samples and r emaining material from other samples may be used for further assay 
optimization/ qualification, biomarkers, or further exploratory analyses. Samples will only be 
used for research  related to influenza virus infection, flu- like disease, and safety , reactogenicity , 
and immunogenicity of CD388. They may also be used to develop t ests/assays related to CD388 
and influenza.

CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 39 of 85 Analyses of biomarkers may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately 
from the study report. 
6.3. Number of Subjects  
Up to 77 subjects will be enrolled in this study, with approximately 56 of the se subjects expected 
to receive CD388 Injection. 
6.4. Measures Taken  to Minimize Bias  
Study drug assignment (CD388 Injection or placebo) will be blinded to all blinded clinical site 
and Sponsor study team until the final study database is locked. Unblinded personnel include the 
site pharmacist (or pharmacist designee)  preparing the injections,  the unblinded pharmacy 
monitor (to ensure study drug accountability and assignment throughout the trial), and  the 
Sponsor’s unblinded team.  
Administration route assignment (IM or SQ) is not blinded. 
6.5. Expected Duration of Subject Participation  
A single dose of study drug will be administered IM or SQ on Day 1. Study participation 
will require up to 28 days for screening procedures, and ~[ADDRESS_1217115] single dose 
(check -in to the CRU on Day -1; CRU inpatient stay for study drug administration, observation, 
and assessments and procedures for 31 days [Days -1 to Day 30]; and 4 CRU outpatient visits 
for additional assessments and pr ocedures).  
Subjects in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B who receive a second single dose will have an additional [ADDRESS_1217116] admin istration . 
6.6. Method of Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
After informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened for study eligibility before randomization. 
Within each route (IM and SQ dose, route assignment is unblinded), subjects will be randomized 
to receive a single dose of CD388 Injection or saline placebo (t reatment assignment is blinded) . 
The study site’s pharmacist (or pharmacist designee) will obtain the study drug assignment via an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) or by a manual paper transaction . 
A subject is considered randomized when a randomizati on transaction is recorded in the IRT 
or the subject’s source documents if performed  manually . 
All blinded study personnel (including the Sponsor, Investigator, and site personnel directly involved in study conduct) and subjects will remain blinded to study drug assignment until the 
study is completed and the final database is locked with the exception of the unblinded pharmacy 
personnel, pharmacy monitor, and unblinded Sponsor personnel ( such as Data Review 
Committe e, clinical suppl y manager, PK lead , and quality manager ) who may be unblinded to 
study medication at any time during study conduct. The pharmacy monitor will monitor study drug preparation and accountability during the study and cases in which unblinding is required due to a safety or tolerability issue. To maintain study blinding, study drug preparation will be 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.[ADDRESS_1217117] (or qualified unblinded personnel at the study site not 
involved with study procedures or evaluations). 
Instructions for study drug preparation and dosing are outlined in the Pharmacy Manual provided 
separately to the site. In the case of a medical emergency requiring the Investigator to know the identity of the study drug, the Investigator will follow the procedures outlined in Section  8.4. 
6.7. Data Review Committee  
A Sponsor Data Review Committee, consisting of representatives of the Sponsor not involved in 
day-to-day management of the study, may be established to review unblinded data to allow 
strategic development decisions within and across development programs. The procedures of the Data Review Committee will be documented in a charter.

an ascending single-dose regimen with the starting dose based on findings from 3-month rat 
and monkey toxicology studies. 
8.1.1. Directions for Use  
CD388 Injection  should be thawed at room temperature over 30 minutes (not to exceed 24 hours) 
prior to drawing the dose from the vial into the syringe. 
After CD388 Injection is drawn from the vial into the syringe, it must be administered  within 
4 hours. 
8.1.2. Drug Storage 
Vials of CD388 Injection should be stored frozen at -20°C. 
8.1.3. Dose Adjustment  
Dosage adjustments of CD388 Injection in individual subjects are not allowed in this study. 
8.2. Placebo Injection  
Normal saline will be administered IM or SQ as the placebo control.  
8.3. Compliance  
Treatment compliance for CD388 Injection/placebo  will be documented in the eCRF by 
[CONTACT_108888], administration  time, and the volume of the dose of study drug administered . 
8.4. Breaking the Blind  
The study is a double-blind design. The Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and subjects 
will not make any effort to determine which blinded study drug (CD388 Injection or placebo) is 
administered. Unblinded pharmacy personnel will be responsible for preparing syringes such that 
the double-blind is maintained. 
Only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of a specific subject, may the Investigator unblind a subject’s study drug 
assignment. 
As soon as possible and without revealing the subject’s study drug assignment (unless important 
to the safety of subjects remaining in the study), the Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.[ADDRESS_1217128] level. Unblinding at treatment/group level is permitted as needed to enable the analysis. After the database is  locked and the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) is final, the study blind codes will be broken.  
8.5. Previous and Concomitant Medications and Substances  
All medications administered within [ADDRESS_1217129] refrain from over-the-counter (OTC) and nutritional supplements within 7 days 
and prescription medications within 14 days or <[ADDRESS_1217130] study drug 
administration, and until after the final study visit (except for hormonal contraceptives,

The Schedule of Events  (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 ) summarizes the frequency and timing of all 
applicable study assessments, including allowable windows for study visits and assessments/
procedures. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study- related procedures are 
performed . 
All procedures should be completed as close to the prescribed/scheduled time as possible. Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns take precedence 
over all routine scheduled procedures. 
When multiple assessments are scheduled at the same time point, perform the assessments in the 
following order: 12- lead ECG , vital signs, and blood sample collection.  
9.1. Medical History  
A complete medical history will be recorded, including demographic information (age, gender, race, and ethnicity ).  
9.2. Physical Examination s 
A complete physical examination is required at screening. Targeted  (i.e., symptom directed) 
physical examinations may be performed at all other indicated visits, and as clinically indicated. 
9.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and dias tolic), heart rate,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487],  and oral 
temperature, and will be measured with the subject in a seated position for at least 3 minutes 
prior to measurement. Height and weight are to be measured and body mass index (BMI) 
calculated  when indicated. 
9.4. Electrocardiograms  
Subjects should be resting and semi-recumbent for safety 12- lead ECGs. Data collection includes 
abnormal findings; if abnormal finding(s) are assessed as clinically significant, the finding(s) should be reported as AE(s). The Investigator is responsible for interpreting and measuring ECG data.  
Continuous digital ECG recording will be performed using a 12-lead Holter ECG monitor.  
• For Cohorts 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, and 3B:   
Pharmacodynamic ECG tracings, including all 12- leads and  of 10 seconds dura tion, will 
be extracted in triplicate at prespecified time points for a 5 -minute observation period 
starting from 1 hour before dosing until 48 hours after administration of study drug 
(expected time to maximum concentration is 1 to 2 days after administra tion), and stored 
in a digital format. Holter monitoring may be longer or shorter depending on available 
PK data. Subjects should be resting and semi-recumbent for [ADDRESS_1217131], and without any other procedures (except those required by [CONTACT_12695]), food, or undue stimulation for the 15 minutes prior to and for the duration of the observation period. 
The Holter monitor may be removed once on Day 2 for up to 15 minutes for 
shower/bathing, at least [ADDRESS_1217132] from the next  ECG timepoint (i.e., 30, 36, or 
48 hours postdose).  
• For Cohorts 3A and 4B ONLY:   
Continuous 12-lead digital ECG recording will be performed using a 12- lead Holter ECG 
monitor. Pharmacodynamic ECG tracings, including all 12 leads and of 10 seconds duration, will be extracted in triplicate at prespecified time points for a 5 -minute 
observation period starting from 1 hour before dosing, then at 72, 76, 80, 84, 96, 102, 
106, 110, 118, and 120 hours after administration of study drug, and stored in a digital 
format.  
The Holter monitor may be removed once on Day 5 for up to 15 minutes for shower/
bathing, at least [ADDRESS_1217133] from the next ECG timepoint. The Holter monitor will be 
removed on Day 6.

the SAE, including study drug administration details, medical history, concomitant medications, 
relevant laboratory test results , and subject outcome information. The SAER should be emailed 
within 24 hours with as much of the above information as available at the time. The following 
minimum information is required for reporting an SAE: subject identification, Investigator 
contact [CONTACT_82753] , an adverse  event with a serious outcome, and the I nvestigator’s assessment 
of causal relationship to study drug. S erious adverse event s are to be reported immediately 
and under no circumstance should this reporting time exceed [ADDRESS_1217140]’s eCRF.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.[ADDRESS_1217141], they should notify the Sponsor 
immediately.  
The Sponsor will report all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) within the 
require d regulatory timeframes to all applicable regulatory authorities and to Investigators as 
required. 
All SAEs that do not meet expedited reporting requirements will be summarized in the 
Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) and reported annually by [CONTACT_108893]. 
11.3.2. Notification of Emerging Safety Issues 
Additionally, the Investigator should alert the Sponsor immediately (under no circumstance 
should this reporting time exceed 24 hours) by [CONTACT_871453]. If time permits, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_871454].  
The Sponsor is responsible for informing other investigators who may need to implement the 
same procedures and for alerting the Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees of the new findings and measures taken in accordance with local regulations within the requi red timeframes.  
11.4. Definitions  
11.4.1. Adverse Event  
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug or study procedure in humans, whether or not considered drug- related. An AE can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (e.g. , a clinical ly significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about causality. An AE can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with 
another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. However, each laboratory abnormality (e.g., clinically significant changes detected on hematology, coagulation, chemistry, 
urinalysis) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or surgical 
intervention, or that leads to interruption of study drug or discontinuation, must be recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clinical condition 
or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal test assessments (e.g., ECGs) that are associated with signs or symptoms must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they 
meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Section  11.4.1 and  Section  11.4.4, 
respectively.  
11.4.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 57 of 85 “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE. “ Suspected adverse reaction ” implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than “ adverse reaction ”, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
11.4.3. Life-Threatening AE or Life- Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ life threatening ” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It  does 
not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
11.4.4. Serious Adverse Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE – see definition above 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug 
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
11.4.5. Unexpected AE or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected”: 
• If it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the nature, severity, 
frequency, or outcome that has been observed 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_871455]) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
“Unexpected ”, as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that 
are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.[ADDRESS_1217142] (AESI s) include anaphylaxis (r efer to Appendix 3 for 
diagnostic criteria and management).  
11.4.7. Emerging Safety Issue 
Any new safety information that may lead to a reassessment of the risk/benefit balance of the 
investigational product and/or impact subjects’ health. Examples include: 
• Any new safety issue relating to the conduct of the clinical trial that may impact the 
safety of the trial subjects such as significant safety results from a recently -completed 
non-clinical study or early termination or temporary suspension of a trial for safety 
reasons that is conducted on the same investigational product 
• Recommendations from a Data Review Committee  that may affect the safety of trial 
subjects  
11.4.8. Urgent Safety Measure  
An urgent safety measure (USM) is a procedure not defined by [CONTACT_108895] , without prior authorization from Ethics Committees or Regulatory 
Authorities , in order to protect  study subject s from any immediate hazard to their health 
and safety.  
11.5. Adverse Event Classification  
11.5.1. Relationship to Study  Drug  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and nonserious ; 
Table 8). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for determining 
the causal assessment. If the event is thought to be unrelated to study drug administration, an alternative explanation should be provided. 
Table 8: Guidelines for Assessing Relationship of Event to Study Drug  
Unrelated  There is little or no chance that the study drug caused the adverse event ( AE); other  conditions, 
including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of  the disease state, or  a reaction 
to a concomitant medication best explain the event . 
Related  The association of the AE with the study drug is unknown; however, the AE is not clearly due to 
another condition, or a reasonable temporal association exists between the AE and study drug 
administration and,  based on the Investigator's clinical experience, the association of the AE 
with the study dr ug seems likely .

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 59 of 85 11.5.2. Severity  
The Investigator will use the grading scale in Table 9 to  describe the intensity of the AE 
following general categorical desc riptors outlined in the DAIDS table for Grading the Severity of 
Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events ( DAIDS  2017 ).  
Table 9: Guidelines for Severity Assessment s 
Grade 1  
Mild Mild symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional activities 
with intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  
Moderate  Moderate symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social and functional activities with intervention indicated
 
Grade 3  
Severe  Severe symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities with intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871432] 4

with intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death 
Grade 5  
Death  Fatal  
Refer to the DAIDS table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events  for details regarding 
event grading.  
11.5.3. Serious Adverse Even t 
Any adverse experience occurring at any dose of study medication that occurs during time  
periods indicated below are considered serious if they r esult in any of the outcomes listed in 
Section  11.4.4.  
Cohort SAE monitoring period from signing of Informed Consent Form:

has not worsened is not considered an SAE. 
11.6. Adverse Event Follow Up  
All unresolved SAEs and study drug- related  AEs will be followed by [CONTACT_695134] , regardless of severity . 
11.7. Adverse Event Management  
The Investigator should employ best medical judgement in determining how to manage AEs. Any questions regarding AE management should be directed to the Medical Monitor.

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 76 of 85 APPENDIX  3. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND MANAGEMENT FOR 
ANAPHYLAXI S 
Diagnostic Criteria  for Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips, -tongue, -uvula) 
and at least one  of the following: 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely al lergen for 
that subject  (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia) 
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e .g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subje ct (minutes to 
several hours): 
a. Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or >30% decrease from that person's baseline 
 
Management of Anaphylaxis 
1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]:  When a subject meets any of the diagnostic criteria, the subject  should 
receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_108840], as  it is the treatment of choice in anaphylaxis. Aqueous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 0.01 mg/kg (maximum dose, 0.5 mg) administered intramuscularly every 
5 to 15 minutes as necessary, is the recommended dosage for controlling symptoms and maintaining blood pressure. The 5-minute interval between injections can be 
liberalized to permit more frequent injections if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_15370].  
2. Oxygen and adrenergic agonists:  High -flow oxygen (through a nonrebreather mask 
or endotracheal tube) should be administered to su bjects  experiencing respi[INVESTIGATOR_108841]. Those who are hemodynamically unstable might benefit from oxygen as well. Inhaled β
2-agonists, such as albuterol, might be useful for bronchospasm 
refractory to epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.[ADDRESS_1217159] : Subjects in anaphylactic shock (i.e., those with anaphylaxis 
and signs of critical organ hypoperfusion) should be placed in a recumbent position with 
the lower extremities elevated unless precluded by [CONTACT_108905]. 
4. Fluid resuscitation:  Subjects who remain hypotensive despi[INVESTIGATOR_108842]. Large volumes of crystalloid might be needed in the first 5 to 10 minutes; in severe reactions with hypotension, up to 35% of the blood volume might extravasate in the first 10 minutes, and vasodilatation can cause pooling, with even more reduction in the effective blood volume and thus distributive shock. 
5. Vasopressors:  Potent vasopressors, such as noradrenaline, vasopressin, or metaraminol, 
might be required to overcome vasodilatation if epi[INVESTIGATOR_871434] a systolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mmHg. 
6. H
1- and H 2-antihistamines:  Antihistamines (H 1- and H 2-antagonists) are slower in onset 
of action than epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], have little effect on blood pressure, and should be considered a second -line treatment for anaphylaxis. 
7. Corticosteroi ds: Because the onset of action is slow, steroids are not useful in the acute 
management stage. It has been suggested that their use might prevent a protracted or biphasic reaction . 
8. Glucagon for persistent hypotension in subjects taking β -blocker: Theoretically, there 
are multiple mechanisms by [CONTACT_9444] β -blockade could blunt the response to epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. 
If administration of ep inephrine in these subjects is ineffective, administration of 
glucagon can be attempted. Glucagon is thought to reverse refractory hypotension and bronchospasm by [CONTACT_871458] β -receptor; 
however, the occurrence and importance of this mechanism of action in anaphylaxis is unproved. 
9. Observation: After the treatment of an anaphylactic reaction, an observation period 
should be considered for all subjects as the reaction might recur as the effect of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_108845] (intramuscular epi[INVESTIGATOR_108846]) and because of the risk of a biphasic reaction (1–72 hours after the acute 
reaction).

For subjects reporting rash, the following should be performed:  
All rashes will be discussed between the Investigator and the Sponsor, and in case of a causal 
relationship between the rash and the study drug, then the following visits and assessments will be performed as indicated below and in the “Visit Schedule for Rash Management” 
(see Appendix 5). Unscheduled follow-up visits for close follow-up of rash will be performed 
based on the grade (severity) of the rash. At the Investigator’s discretion, additional visits and assessments may  be performed.  
The rash event should be captured in the AE s ection of the eCRF, as well as in more detail in the 
specific rash assessment pages of the eCRF.  
In case of rash, blood samples need to be collected  for safety laboratory testing, and processed by 
[CONTACT_12082]. These samples need to be collected  during the unscheduled visits as 
described below and in Appendix 5. A copy of the local laboratory reports should be anonymized and will be retrieved  by [CONTACT_2037]. 
The following parameters need to be tested: AST, ALT, creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a complete blood cell count (including hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell [ RBC] 
count, white blood cell [ WBC ] count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, 
basophils, and platelet count). 
Digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_871435] 5. Digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_108848]’s secure server. Only the study team will have access to 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].  
The subject may be treated symptomatically until the rash resolves. If the rash is considered to be most likely due to concomitant illness or non-study medication, standard management, including 
discontinuation of the likely causative agent, should be undertaken, and the continuation of the 
subject in the study should be discussed with the Sponsor. 
Dermatologist fees for evaluating subjects who experience a rash will be reimbursed by [CONTACT_429]. 
The following grades are based on the DAIDS Toxicity Grading Scale ( DAIDS  2017) with 
adaptations made by [CONTACT_1034]: Subjects should be informed that they should contact [CONTACT_108906] (unscheduled visit, day 1 of the rash) when they notice any rash.

Grade 3 or Grade 4 Rash  
A Grade 3 rash is defi ned as: 
• vesiculation, moist desquamation, or ulceration  OR 
• cutaneous event with one of the following  (revised by [CONTACT_1034]): 
− elevations in AST/ALT more than 2×  baseline value and  ≥5 × ULN  
− fever >38°C or 100°F 
− eosinophils >1000/mm

• Appropriate management should be undertaken and subjects should be followed until 
resolution of the rash.  
• The description of the rash should be reported per ‘Unscheduled Visit in Case of Rash’ in the 
eCRF (i .e., the initial rash assessment pages). The follow-up rash assessment pages of the 
eCRF should be completed for all follow-up visits. 
For close follow -
 up of the rash, unscheduled visits will be performed as follows: 
• Follow-up visits on days 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_1217167]’s AST/ALT on day 1 
and/or day 2 of rash >2 × baseline value, and/or ≥5  × ULN and/or in case of rash progression. 
For these and all  subsequent local laboratory blood sample assessments: a copy of the local 
laboratory report should be anonymized and will be retrieved  by [CONTACT_2037]. 
• A  follow-up visit on day 6 of the rash is required and additional safety blood samples 
and digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_871438] 1/[ADDRESS_1217168]/ALT levels or rash 
progression. 
• Thereafter, weekly follow -up visits are required (or more frequently at the Investigator’s 
discretion) as long as Grade 3–4 rash is present. Once Grade 3 –4 rash has resolved to 
Grade ≤ 2, follow -up should be performed  according to the instructions for follow-up visits 
for Grade 1 or Grade 2 rash, respectively. 
• As long as the rash remains Grade [ADDRESS_1217169]’s AST/ALT on day 6 of rash 
is still >2 × baseline value and/or ≥5 × ULN and/or in case of rash progression, until

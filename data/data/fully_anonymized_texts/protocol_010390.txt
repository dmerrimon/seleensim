the disease  
Total effective non -diseased aortic proximal neck len gth of ≥ 20 
mm between the distal end of left common carotid (LCC) ostium 
to the beginning of the disease, including ≥ 10 mm between the 
LSA and LCC  
Non -aneurysmal aortic distal neck length ≥ 20 mm  
Study Purpose:  The purpose of the clinical investigation  is to assess  the 
feasibility  of the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System  
to repair fusiform/saccular aneurysms, penetrating ulcers  and 
chronic type B dissections  of the DTA  in patients who require 
coverage  of the LSA , including an assessment of the safety and 
effectiveness of the device acutely and at the [ADDRESS_412945] Status:  The Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System is a modular 
system intended to maintain perfusion of the LSA when the 
device is implanted in Zone 2 of the aortic arch for the exclusion 
of a Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA), PAU, and CTBD.  
The Valiant Mona  LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System is comprised 
of two key components:  
• The Main Stent Graft (MSG) which is delivered using the 
Main Delivery System (MDS)  
• The Branch Stent Graft (BSG) which is delivered using the 
Branch Delivery System  (BDS)  
This device is c onsidered investigational in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US).  
Study Objective:  The primary safety and effectiveness objectives will be measured 
acutely and at the [ADDRESS_412946] 
imp lantation, consisting of aorta -related mortality, stroke, 
paraplegia and left arm/hand ischemia.  
The primary effectiveness objective for the Valiant Mona LSA 
Thoracic Stent Graft System is defined as successful delivery and 
deployment of the Main Stent Gr aft (MSG) and Branch Stent 
Graft (BSG) at implant and successful exclusion of the 
aneurysm/penetrating ulcer or primary entry tear while 
maintaining patency of the BSG at the 30 day visit.  
In addition, analyses of periprocedural through discharge clinical  
utility measures will be conducted.  
Primary 
Observations:  Primary Safety Observation:  
Within 1 month (Day 0 – Day 30) from the index procedure, 
composite endpoint consisting of:  
• Aorta -Related Mortality  
• Stroke  
• Paraplegia   
• Left Arm/Hand Ischemia  
Primary Effectiveness Observation:  
The primary effectiveness observation is treatment success 
(defined below) and will be captured within the initial reporting 
period of 1 month from the index procedure. Treatment success  
is defined as technical success, which is the successful delivery 
and deployment of the stent graft (deployment of the Valiant 
Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System in the planned location 
with no unintentional coverage of other vessels, assessed intra -
operatively, and the removal of the d elivery system) and 
successful exclusion of the aneurysm/penetrating ulcer or 
primary entry tear while maintaining patency of the MSG and BSG 
at the 30 day visit.  
Additional 
Observations:  Periprocedural through Discharge Clinical Utility Measures

 1. INTRODUCTION  
An Early Feasibility study was conducted in order to provide important information 
regarding the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System . This included:  
• Validat ion of  the procedure in humans, including the procedural steps, physician 
technique, and patient characteristics.  
• Assess ment of the safety and performance of the device acutely and at the 30 day  
visit , specifically in regards to delivery and deployment and exclusion of the 
aneurysm and patency of the LSA.  
• Collection of thoracic arch movement parameters in humans, both before  and after 
placement of the device.  
• Collect ion of  imaging data to augment the current use conditions data set.  
The device was successfully implanted into nine (9) subjects and continues to function as 
intended. Data collected from the Early Feasibility s tudy allowed Medtronic to identify 
implantation procedural steps that required further clarification, in particular that 
manipulations of the stent graft devices and accessory devices should be performed distal 
to the LSA. In order to fu rther  characterize the study device , ad ditional s ubjects will be 
enrolled into a Feasibility study for the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System.  
The purpose of the Feasibility Study i s to characterize the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic 
Stent Graft System, in particular to assess the safety and effectiveness  of the device 
acutely and at the [ADDRESS_412957] population . This study will also 
evaluate the current instructions for use (IFU) and may  direct changes to the delivery and 
deployment steps .  
The purpose of the expansion to the Feasibility Study i s to characterize the Valiant Mona 
LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System, in particular to assess the safety and effectiveness of 
the device acutely and at the 30 day visit, in subjects enrolled with chronic, Type B 
dissections. The chronic Type B  Dissection  exp ansion subjects will be prospectively 
enrolled in support of a future premarket approval analysis for the Valiant Mona LSA 
device . This Clinical Investigational P lan (CIP) describes the study requirements for the 
Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft Syste m.

 2. BACKGROUND  
There has been a remarkable evolution in the treatment of thoracic aortic disease s, from 
open surgery to endovascular therapy, which has significantly decreased morbidity and 
mortality in these patients.1  
The early success of endovascular stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) 
has fostered the application of these devices for the management of descending thoracic 
aortic diseases, including thoraci c aortic aneurysms (TAA), acute and chronic Type B 
dissection, intramural hematoma, penetrating ulcer, traumatic injury, mycotic aneurysms

and dissection in greater  detail.  
Descending Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm  
An aortic aneurysm is defined as a dilatation of the aortic vessel greater than 50% of it s 
normal diameter for a given segment of the adhering normal vessel.19 A descending 
thoracic aneurysm (DTA) is defined as involving any portion of the thoracic aorta distal to 
the left subclavian artery and extending to above the diaphragm.20 In adults, the diameter 
of the normal aorta is approximately 30 mm at the aortic root and approximately 25 mm at 
the level of the diaphragm. Age is the major influential factor in aortic diameter 
enlargement and all aortic diameters increase with age.21 It has been report ed that aortic 
diameters increase about 1 mm per decade during adulthood.22 Generally, a diameter in 
the thoracic aorta greater than 4.5 cm is considered aneurysmal.19,20,21,22,23 
A DTA is a life -threatening condition. Annually, the incidence of thoracic aor tic aneurysms 
(TAA) in a population -based study is 10.4 per 100,000 person -years, and the descending 
thoracic aorta is involved in about 40% of those cases.[ADDRESS_412960], Dayal R, Lin S, Trociolla S, Rhee J, Craig Kent K. Endovascular stent graft selection for the

aneurysmal segment, and replacement using a Dacron graft. Thoracic endovascu lar aortic 
repair (TEVAR) consists of transfemoral or iliac introduction of the device. When the stent 
graft device is deployed and expanded within the aneurysmal blood vessel, it creates a new 
aortic lumen for blood flow, excluding the aneurysm sac, while  maintaining perfusion to the 
lower body. Studies comparing open surgical repair to endovascular repair concluded that 
the latter offers a less invasive, less expensive alternative, a decrease in mortality and 
morbidity in high -risk patients, and is associ ated with a shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_334358] a quicker 
return to normal activities after surgery.27,[ADDRESS_412962] ic imaging modalities combined with longer life expectancy and 
exposure to high blood pressure has enhanced awareness of the spectrum of acute and 
chronic aortic syndromes.29 One such condition is aortic dissection, which involves a 
progressive tear in the aorta. The inner lining (intima) of the aorta tears resulting in 
propagation of blood within the middle layer (media), usually distally, but sometimes 
retrograde with multiple reentry sites. An aortic dissection is classified as Stanford Type A 
or B depend ing on involvement of the ascending or descending thoracic aorta . Type A 
dissection begins in the ascending part of  the aorta and typi[INVESTIGATOR_334359].  Type B dissection begins in the descending part of the  aorta and typi[INVESTIGATOR_334360]

Conventional treatment of thoracic aortic dissection has either been medical management 
or an open surgical procedure, depending upon the patient’s clinical presentat ion. For 
Type B aortic dissections a complication specific treatment approach with surgery is 
usually followed with medical management applied as the primary treatment for 
uncomplicated cases. Medical management primarily focuses on reducing blood pressure 
to reduce the stresses on the diseased vessel, but does not treat the dissection or 
underlying disease.  This has been the preferred treatment for acute Type B dissections in 
many institutions.2,3,4,31,32,33,34,35 Outcomes prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_334361] r uncomplicated, 
acute Type B dissections are considered acceptable with 90% survival reported;36 
however, 20% to 40% of patients who have passed their acute phase with medical anti -
hypertensive therapy will likely need surgery during the chronic phase due to aneurysmal 
enlargement of the aortic dissection.2,31,32,35,[ADDRESS_412964] one of the following:  malperfusion 
syndrome (visceral, renal or lower limb), rupture, uncontrollable hypertension or refractory

Chronic type B dissection is defined as an aortic dissection that is treated greater than 30 
days after symptom onset. The natural history for chronic type B dissection is different 
based on which part of the thoracic aorta is involved, the ascending aorta or the 
descending aorta. Having a history of Marfan’s syndrome, age, greater size of aorta at 
bas eline, persistent hypertension that is not well controlled, and having a patent false 
lumen are risk factors that predispose these patients to development of aorta -related 
complications during the chronic phase.  Aortic growth rate may be from 10mm to  74mm

Treatment of type B aortic dissections includes optimal medical therapy (OMT) for those 
patients who are stable, open surgical repair for those patients who are symptomatic and 
have lower surgical risks based on their medical history and presentation, and

 and a reported CVA rate of 4%.[ADDRESS_412987] -operative aorta -related changes may occur in patients treated for PAU. One article71 
cites a rate as high as 21% of secondary interventions for PAU patients.  
While endovascular stent graft treatment has significantly improved outcomes in patients 
with DTA  disease, further evolution and innovation of these devices is necessary  as many 
patients have disease that involves the aortic arch . The stent grafts currently available in 
the [LOCATION_002] for treatment of disease of the DTA  require a minimum proximal neck 
length (the distance from the proximal edge of the aneurysm to the distal origin of the LSA) 
in order to ensure an adequate seal of the graft to healthy aorta. Approximately 40% of 
TEVAR patients do not meet this criteria.72,73 In these cases, consideration needs to be 
given to whether the patient’s left subclavian artery (LSA) provides additional treatment 
options, whereby [CONTACT_334380] a stent graft 
lengthens the proximal landing z one. When blood flow is excluded from the LSA, patients 
are at a higher risk of left arm ischemia, spi[INVESTIGATOR_334367], vertebrobasilar ischemia, 
anterior circulation stroke, and death.74  
To manage the treatment of these patients, consideration is given w hether or not to 
revascularize the LSA. Revascularization can be performed before TEVAR or after, if 
symptoms present. The Society for Vascular Surgery’s (SVS) published practice guidelines 
recommend preoperative revascularization in all patients unless an  emergent situation 
prevents the option or local surgical expertise is unavailable.75 Patients for which 
preoperative revascularization is strongly recommended include those with:  
• Coronary artery by[CONTACT_334381] a patent left internal mammary artery

 • Occlusion or absence of the right vertebral artery  
• Left arm arteriovenous shunt  
• Prior infrarenal aortic repair with ligation of the lumbar and middle sacral arteries  
• Long segment coverage of the descending thoracic aorta affecting critical 
intercostal arteries  
• Hypogastric occlusion  
• Discontinuity in the vertebrobasilar collaterals namely the termination of the left 
vertebral artery at the posterior inferior cerebellar artery  
Preoperative revascularization consists of either by[CONTACT_334382]. Additionally, the LSA is occluded or ligated in order to prevent potential 
Type II endoleaks post -TEVAR. However, subclavian revascularization is not without 
serious risks. Complications of LSA revascularization have been reported to occur in 2.4 to 
12.2% of patients. These include stroke, bleeding, injury to the thoracic duct, and left 
cervical nerves including the phrenic nerve and brachial plexus. Although most nerve 
damage is temporary, permanent defects can persis t in approximately 3% of patients.74 
Because of the potential complications and the additional surgical procedure, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_334368], some physicians decide not to 
perform LSA revascularization. Often, LSA revascularization is performed when the 
patient has a dominant left vertebral artery, a previous left internal mammary coronary 
artery by[CONTACT_9292] (CABG), or an absent distal right vertebral segment. Alternatively, 
advances in stent graft design provide additional options for preserving patency  of the LSA 
with fenestrated, multi -branched, or the use of chimney grafts.  
A well -established procedure and materials for TEVAR provides a foundation for these 
treatment option advances. All three options require modifications to currently available 
sten t graft systems. The fenestrated device requires the operator to create fenestrations 
(i.e., holes) in the stent graft (pre -implant) in order to facilitate blood flow to the great 
vessels within the covered region. These fenestrations are secured with bare -metal or 
covered stents used as bridging stents. The multi -branch option incorporates axially 
oriented, covered stent graft cuffs to accommodate the great vessels. These stent graft 
configurations are custom -made, adding at least six to eight weeks76 betwe en evaluation 
and treatment. A hybrid approach combines stent graft cuffs positioned in the

 fenestrations to allow for a seal to be established within the branched artery, rather than at 
the origin, providing more flexibility for patient -specific variation s in arch morphology. The 
primary limit ation  to the advancement of this option has been in the lack of covered stent 
graft cuffs sized appropriately for the great vessels.  
A modular, off -the -shelf option needs to incorporate elements of all three techniqu es in 
order to preserve patency of the LSA and provide a more established treatment option. 
Valiant Mona LSA provides that unmet need of a singular endovascular procedure for 
disease encroaching the LSA.  The Valiant Mona LSA device provides off -the -shelf, 
branched, endograft technology to the patient, with the benefits of endovascular 
technology – namely decreased procedure time, decreased blood loss, and decreased 
mortality rates.  
An Early Feasibility study was conducted in order to provide important infor mation 
regarding the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System  in descending thoracic aortic 
aneurysms and penetrating ulcers including validation of the procedural steps and patient 
selection, an acute assessment of the safety and performance of the de vice at 1 month, 
and collection of imaging from the subjects in order to understand device movements in 
humans to augment the current use conditions data set .  
The device was successfully implanted into nine (9) subjects and continues to function as 
intend ed. Data collected from the Early Feasibility study allowed Medtronic to identify 
patient selection and implantation procedural steps that required further clarification, in 
particular t o exclude grade IV and grade V aortic atheroma anatomies and t hat 
mani pulations of the stent graft devices and accessory devices should be performed distal 
to the LSA. In order to further characterize the study device , a traditional Feasibility study 
for the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System  is necessary . The Valiant Mona LSA 
Thoracic Stent Graft System design used during the Early Feasibility study will be used for 
the Feasibility Study.  
The purpose of th e Feasibility Study i s to characterize the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic 
Stent Graft System, in particular  to assess the safety and effectiveness of the device 
acutely and at the [ADDRESS_412991] were deemed  appropriate to expand 
assessment of the safety and performance outcomes in subjects with chronic Type B 
dissections. The purpose of the expansion to the Feasibility Study i s to characterize the 
Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System, in particular to assess the safety and 
effectiveness of the device acutely and at the 30 day visit, in subjects enrolled with chronic, 
Type B dissections. The chronic Type B Dissection exp ansion subjects will be 
prospectively enrolled in support of a future premarket approval analysis for the Valiant 
Mona LSA device .

 4. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE   
The Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft  System is a modular system intended to 
maintain perfusion of the LSA when the device is implanted in Zone 2 of the aortic arch for 
the exclusion of a TAA , PAU, and CTBD . Details regarding the device design are presented 
in the following sections.  
4.1. DEVICE COMPONENTS  
The Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft  System is comprise d of two key components 
(See Figure 4-1):  
• The Main Stent Graft (MSG) which is delivered using the M ain Stent Graft  Delivery 
System  
• The Branch Stent Graft (BSG) which is delivered using the B ranch Stent Graft  
Delivery System

Medtronic Confidential  
This document is electronically controlled    056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template  
 Main Stent Graft  
The Main Stent Graft (MSG) is based on the commercial Valiant Stent Graft platform  
(P100040 approved on April 1, 2011) . As shown in Table 4-2 below, the MSG includes a 
“cuff” at the proximal section of the stent graft. This cuff is used for mating of the MSG 
with the Bra nch Stent Graft (BSG).  
The MSG (with the exception of the cuff) is manufactured using monofilament polyester 
fabric and nitinol stents. The stent graft material, stent material and surface finish are 
identical to those used on the Valiant Stent Graft. The designs of all stents are also 
identical to Valiant with the exception of the two most proximal body stents and the stent 
on the cuff (Mobile External Connector [MEC] stent).  
 
. 
The cuff is intended to seal with the BSG which provides for perfusion of the LSA. This cuff 
is made using HDM polyester fabric which is identical to that used on the commercially 
available Endurant II stent graft  (P100021, approved on April 27, 2012 ). The  design of the 
cuff  
 is the same across all sizes of the MSG. The cuff contains two 
Platinum Iridium (Pt-Ir) radiopaque marker coils at the top and bott om  of the cuff to assist 
with visualization during deployment and guide placement . These coils are located within a 
fold of fabric and as such do not directly come in contact [CONTACT_334383]. 
An additional P t-Ir marker is placed immediate ly distal to the cuff, again to assist with 
visualization and deployment accuracy. The cuff features a stent at the top, called the MEC 
Stent.

Main Delivery System  
The Main Delivery System (MDS) will be used to deploy the MSG . The MDS design is based 
on the commercially available Valiant Captivia Delivery System. The modifications made to 
the Valiant Captivia Delivery System include the addition of proximal and distal end 
components and features to provide pre -cannulation of th e MSG cuff with the LSA 
guidewire.  
This delivery system platform provides a mechanical advantage during deployment 
coupled with a tip capture mechanism for deployment accuracy. The modifications to the 
current Valiant Captivia Delivery System include the f ollowing:  
• a modified 4 -groove Tapered Tip assembly  
•  
• a modified End Seal Y -adapter assembly  
• a modified External Slider assembly  
• a modified Screw Gear half   
• a new Second Lumen assembly

Figure 4-3: Main Delivery System (Figure not to Scale)  
 
4.3. BRANCH STENT GRAFT SYSTEM  
Branch Stent Graft  
The primary function of the Branch Stent Graft ( BSG ) is to mate with the MSG  cuff and 
perfuse the Left Subclavian Artery (LSA). The BSG is offered in 10mm, 12mm and 14mm 
diameters. All three size offerings have a 40mm length and mate with the single 10mm 
diameter  cuff opening  on the MSG . To maximize the separation resistance of the junc tion 
between the MSG and the BSG, a flared section was added to the proximal end of the 
10mm and 12mm BSG designs. This flared section is not required on the 14mm design, 
since the larger diameter forms a natural flare on either side of the cuff opening . 
The BSG is composed of a multifilament polyester graft fabric and nitinol stents. The stent 
material and surface finish are identical to those used on the commercial Valiant Stent 
Graft. The multifilament polyester material is similar to that used on the co mmercially 
available Endurant Stent Graft,

 The sutures on the BSG are composed of Ultra High Molecular Weight 
Polyethylene (UHMWPE) which is the same base material used on commercial Endurant II 
Stent G rafts for attaching the supraren al stents to the proximal edge  of the graft. The BSG 
suture has a smaller diameter than the Endurant II suture.  
The body stent of the BSG is a helical design connected to end stents with nitinol crimps. 
The flared stent on the 10mm and 12mm is a standalone stent and is not connected t o the 
helical or end stent.  
 
 
Spherical Platinum Iridium radiopaque markers are located on both the proximal and distal 
ends of the BSG.

 Branch Delivery System  
The Branch Delivery System (BDS) will be used for the deployment of the BSG. The BDS 
design is based on both the commercially available Endurant II Limb and Valiant Captivia 
Delivery Systems. The distal end of the BDS is a modification of the 14Fr Endurant II Limb 
Delivery System while th e proximal end of the delivery system is leveraged from Valiant 
Captivia Closed Web Delivery System. Additionally, the Graft Cover, Tapered Tip assembly 
and Middle Member have been modified for improved kink resistance in the new use 
conditions associated with navigating into the LSA. Figure 4-5 below presents the Branch 
Delivery System.

 5. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
5.1 STUDY PURPOSE  
The purpose of the clinical investigation  is to assess the feasibility of the Valiant Mona LSA 
Thoracic Stent Graft System  to repair fusiform/saccular aneurysms, penetrating ulcers  
and chronic type B dissections  of the DTA  in patients who require coverage  of the LSA , 
including an assessment of  the safety and effectiveness of the device acutely and at the [ADDRESS_412993] population. Procedural information will be collected in 
order to enhance  the current instructions for use  and  delivery and deployment steps.  
The chronic Type B Dissection expansion subjects will be prospectively enrolled in support 
of a future premarket approval analysis for the Valiant Mona LSA device . 
Patients diagnosed with  an aneurysmal descending thoracic aorta , penetrating ulcer,  or 
chronic type B dissection who meet the eligibility criteria for the study may be enrolled (see 
Section 9.1 - Eligibility Criteria) . Additionally, these patients must be candidates for 
revascularization of the LSA and anatomically appropriate for the device.  
 
5.2 SCOPE AND DURATION OF THE CLINICAL  STUDY  
Study enrollment started  in the [LOCATION_002] in 2015. Up to ten  (10) investigational sites 
may participate. The enrollment period is estimated to be 20 months. To ensure adequate 
disease state representation in the overall stu dy dataset, a minimum of approximately 
25% of the subjects will be enrolled for the treatment of aneurysms or penetrating ulcers 
and a minimum of approximately 25% of the subjects will be enrolled for the treatment of 
chronic Type B dissections.  
Data from the 44 subjects who under go treatment with the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic 
Stent Graft System in th is study will be analyzed and summarized in the Annual Progress 
Reports (APR) for FDA. Data collected in this study may be used to submit original 
marketing applications for approval to commercially distribute the device system.  
To permit collection of long -term safety and effectiveness data  on the stent graft system,  
subjects  will be followed for a total of [ADDRESS_412994] exited , the study will be closed .

 6. CLINICAL STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a p rospective, single -arm, non -randomized, multicenter, pre -market clinical 
study evaluating subjects implanted with the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft 
System for the treatment of aneurysms , type B chronic dissections, and  penetrating ulcers 
of the descending thoracic aorta who  are candidates for revascularization of the left 
subclavian artery . All analyses will be descriptive in nature and no statistical comparisons 
are planned. Th is study is not a hypothesis driven study; no hypotheses testing will be 
carried out.  
There is no sample size calculation since this study  is not a hypothesis driven study; 
however, the number of enrolled subjects is pre -specified. Th is study  will enroll up to 44 
subjects.

 7.  METHODS  AND ANAL YS ES 
7.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY OBSERVATIONS  
7.1.1  Primary Safety Observation  
The following data points will be collected for reporting.  The initial reporting period will be 
all occurrences  within 1 month (Day 0 – Day 30) from the index procedure . The d ata will 
consist of:  
• Aorta -Related Mortality  
• Stroke  
• Paraplegia   
• Left Arm/ Hand Ischemia  
 
7.1.2  Primary Effectiveness Observation  
The primary effectiveness observation  is treatment success (defined below) and will be 
captured within the initial reporting period of  1 month from the index procedure . 
Treatment success  is defined as : 
Technical success, which is the successful delivery and deployment of the stent graft 
(deployment of the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System in the planned loca tion 
with no unintentional coverage of other vessels , assessed intra -operatively, and the 
removal of the delivery system) and successful exclusion of the aneurysm/penetrating 
ulcer or primary entry tear  while maintaining patency of the MSG and BSG at 30 day visit . 
 
7.1.3  Additional Observations  
The following additional observations  will be evaluated through the 30 day  visit  and at each 
follow up visit .  
• Major adverse events (MAEs)  rates within 30 days of the initial or secondary 
procedures, including:  
o All-Cause Mortality  
o Myocardial Infarction  
o Paraplegia  
o Renal Failure  
o Stroke  
o Left Arm/ Hand Ischemia  
• Secondary endovascular procedures

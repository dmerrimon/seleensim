112 Background
2.1.1 Device Preclinical Experience
N/A
2.1.[ADDRESS_914558] submitted through FDA’s 501(k) pathway 
while simultaneously reviewed as part of FDA’s Software Precertification Pi[INVESTIGATOR_676362]’s Digital Health Precertification Working Model 1.0.1 Similar consumer digital 
technologies and software applications are growing in use and are increasingly brought to FDA 
for authorization for treatment. 
The PEAR-003b digital therapeutic will be delivered via mobile devices to patients with insomnia  
as 6 core CBT-I modules over 9 weeks,2-4 based on the features and functionality originally tested 
in the SHUTi web-based program.5 We will also enroll patients in the Hugo platform to 
understand patient experience with insomnia by [CONTACT_676373]’ EHR data, survey data on 
patient-reported outcomes, healthcare utilization metrics, and patient activity and sleep 
recorded via Fitbit. 
2.2 Background/prevalence of research topic
Insomnia is one of the most prevalent health concerns and imposes a significant physical, 
psychological, and financial burden on patients’ lives.6 Up to 50% of the general adult population 
experience insomnia symptoms, with 12-20% meeting criteria for chronic insomnia.7,[ADDRESS_914559]-effective

healthcare utilization data, and data from connected devices. The data generated will be used 
alongside clinically-validated measures of insomnia to yield a multidimensional analysis of 
patient benefit.

3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact
Significance:
Specific Aim [ADDRESS_914563] patient-
reported outcome measures (PROMs) of insomnia, as well as clinically validated metrics for 
insomnia (all modified to a mobile-friendly format). Patient self-reported data collected via Hugo 
will include insomnia severity using the self-reported insomnia severity index (ISI) scale.[ADDRESS_914564] data on depression (using the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8]),20daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (measured using the Epworth sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50526] [ESS]),21 stress (measured using the 
perceived stress scale [PSS-10]),22 health-related quality of life (measured using the Short-form 
12 [SF-12])23 and anxiety (measured using the general anxiety disorder-7 scale [GAD-7]).24 
Specific Aim 2 addresses the outstanding question of whether a novel PDT (i.e., PEAR-003b) can 
use the Hugo platform to feasibly collect real-world healthcare utilization data from the YNHH or 
Mayo Clinic EHR and show trends for changes in healthcare utilization and healthy utility scores 
among the PDT cohort as well as the relationship between engagement with PDT and clinical 
outcomes. EHR data collected via the Hugo platform will include emergency department 
encounters, medications, inpatient visits, and outpatient visits. 
We will also ask patients to link their health system data from anywhere they received care to 
their Hugo account. This will allow us to collect information from outside healthcare providers 
(i.e. if patients received care outside of YNHH or the Mayo Clinic related to their insomnia ). 
Lastly, exploratory Aim 1 will address the feasibility of linking Fitbit (Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1312] 2) to the Hugo 
platform in order to evaluate patient activity data including heart rate, tracking steps per day 
and/or exercise, sleep (total sleep time in minutes), and self-reported metrics such as weight, 
height and BMI. 
Potential Impact:
Results from this study will advance our understanding of: (1) how novel ways of collecting and 
aggregating clinical and patient-reported outcomes data can support informed clinical decision-
making (2) digital therapeutic engagement and its relationship to clinical outcomes; and (3)

the patient’s entire medical record. The Hugo platform, like many other personal health records, 
is not a covered entity; therefore, the HIPAA privacy rule does not apply to this platform. The 
Hugo platform does take all necessary precautions, including industry-standard encryption, to 
minimize privacy and security risks to personally identifiable information stored on behalf of 
study participants. Hugo makes publicly available its Security Statement 
(http://hugophr.com/security), its Privacy Notice ( http://hugophr.com/privacy-notice), and 
Terms of Service ( http://hugophr.com/terms-of-service/) 
Participants will undergo the possible inconvenience of filling out electronic patient-reported 
outcome measure surveys, which can take up to 60 minutes at each time point (at baseline, 9, 
21, 35, and [ADDRESS_914566]-randomization). Additionally, some participants may feel 
uncomfortable providing data over the phone and have concerns about the confidentiality of 
their digital data. They may also have concerns about the legitimacy of a digital therapeutic. 
Patients will be provided the sleep clinic contact [CONTACT_676374]-8 questionnaire. The PHQ-8 
is a validated measure for depression that was modified from the original PHQ-9 to not include a 
question about suicidality and has been used in prior studies.25-27  
Participants may also experience the possible inconvenience of wearing a Fitbit for extended 
periods of time and syncing these devices with the Hugo platform. Although the Fitbit has been 
deemed a ‘Low-Risk Device’ by [CONTACT_1622]28 and is therefore not deemed medical grade,29 there is 
the risk of inaccuracy in Heart Rate or sleep measurements. According to the Fitbit terms of

sleep specific outcomes (ISI and diary-derived sleep metrics).
Definition of sleep outcomes: 
Sleep efficiency (SE): The ratio of total sleep time (TST) to time in bed (TIB).
Sleep onset latency (SOL): The length of time that it takes to accomplish the transition from 
full wakefulness to sleep, normally to the lightest of the non-REM sleep stages.
Sleep quality: One's satisfaction of the sleep experience, integrating aspects of sleep 
initiation, sleep maintenance, sleep quantity, and refreshment upon awakening.
Waking after sleep onset (WASO): Periods of wakefulness occurring after defined sleep 
onset.
Exploratory Outcomes (ascertained at 9-weeks 21-weeks, 35-weeks, and 61-weeks post-
randomization):
Physical and sleep activity measured using Fitbit (steps per day, sleep [total sleep time in 
minutes], and self-reported metrics such as weight, height, and BMI) from baseline to 9-, 21-, 
35-, and 61-weeks post randomization comparing PDT to control.

There are no restrictions.
6.2 Assessments
6.2.1 Efficacy
The sleep outcomes identified in this study (Insomnia Severity Index and sleep diary-derived metrics 
of SOL and WASO) are considered together when evaluating efficacy of the PDT. These measures are 
part of recent guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine30,31 as outcomes to be 
considered in evaluation of efficacy and clinical significance.  
6.2.2 Safety
N/A. This study has been deemed minimal risk because the probability and magnitude of harm 
or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those 
ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or 
psychological examinations or tests and will therefore not be required to be reviewed by a data 
safety monitoring committee. Information about the minimal risks for this study can be found in 
Section 3.2.1.  
If the study team learns that a participant has clinical depression during screening, or identifies a 
participant as having clinical depression during the study, the participant will be instructed to 
schedule an appoint with their primary care clinician; if the participant does not have a primary 
care clinician, the study team will offer to help the participant schedule an appointment with a 
primary care clinician at the New Haven Primary Care Consortium (NHPCC).
6.2.3 Adverse Events Definition and Reporting
This protocol presents minimal risks to the subjects and Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks 
to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including adverse events, are not anticipated. In the unlikely 
event that such events occur, they will be reported immediately, followed by a written report 
within 5 calendar days of the PIs becoming aware of the event to the IRB (using the appropriate 
forms from the website) and any appropriate funding and regulatory agencies. The investigators 
will apprise fellow investigators and study personnel of all UPI[INVESTIGATOR_676368]. The 
protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g. study sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and 
regulatory and decision-making bodies, will be informed of a data breach within 5 days of the 
event becoming known to the PI.

initial consult. Eligible patients must be aged between 22-[ADDRESS_914582] a 
diagnosis of chronic insomnia (see inclusion/exclusion criteria above in section 5.3.2). If they are 
interested clinic staff will notify the RA. Additionally, the patient will be provided with the study 
team’s contact [CONTACT_676383]. Eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_676384]. The RAs will 
approach the patient for consent into the study while they are waiting for their sleep consult 
appointment/referral to see the sleep specialist. The wait time between enrollment and follow

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/19/[ADDRESS_914583] is up to 12 weeks; therefore, this is a prime opportunity for patient 
enrollment and completion of this project.
The RA will also reach out to patients on the waitlist for in-person CBT-I upon the sleep 
clinician’s approval. If the patient is interested in the study, the RA will attempt to arrange an in-
person visit to conduct the consent and enrollment process. If an in-person visit is not possible, 
the RA will arrange a time for a Zoom call with the patient. 
Additionally, a flyer will be circulated to the Sleep Clinic staff to provide to any patients who may 
express interest in the study (Appendix 7). 
6.3.[ADDRESS_914584] the 
Research Associate (RA) about the potential participant. If the RA is present in clinic, they will 
introduce themselves to the patient and provide additional information about the study. Should 
a clinician identify an eligible patient at a time when the RA is not present, the clinician will 
inform the patient about the study and ask if the patient would be willing to be contact[CONTACT_676385]. If so, the clinician will email the RA, who  will then contact [CONTACT_676386]. If yes, the RA will attempt to arrange an in-person 
visit to conduct the consent and enrollment process. If an in-person visit is not possible, the RA 
will arrange a time for a Zoom call with the patient to complete all steps of consent and 
enrollment (minus the Fitbit set-up) via Zoom. The coordinator will then mail the Fitbit to the 
patient for arrival within [ADDRESS_914585] done so if they were not enrolled in our study. 
Upon consent into the study, the patients will receive a Fitbit. For both arms of the study, Hugo 
will be used as a data collection platform as it aggregates data from multiple real-world data 
sources, thereby [CONTACT_676387]-reported outcomes, clinical outcomes, and 
healthcare utilization metrics. All participants will receive materials on sleep hygiene and healthy 
sleep tips. These sleep hygiene recommendations and healthy sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_676369] a good night’s sleep (e.g. setting a regular bed-time, getting out of 
bed if remaining awake, exercising regularly, not smoking). A full list of these tips can be found in

intervention via diaries and questionnaires as outlined in the “Follow-up” section.  
Because the Hugo platform obtains patient data through patient portals, all patients who 
connect will need a YNHH MyChart account. If the patient does not yet have a MyChart account, 
the RA will assist the patient in creating one. The RA will then assist the patient in linking their 
YNHH electronic health records to the Hugo platform as well as other health systems where they 
have received care by [CONTACT_676388], provided that these health systems are connected to the Hugo platform.
Upon enrollment and following syncing of the Hugo and Fitbit devices (with assistance from the 
RA), patients in both study arms will complete a baseline assessment that will include 
questionnaires as well as 10 days of sleep diaries within a 14-day window. Questionnaires will 
relate to insomnia severity (ISI),19 depression (PHQ-8)20, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (ESS)21, stress (PSS-
10)22, health-related quality of life (SF-12)23 and anxiety (GAD-7).[ADDRESS_914587] at enrollment. Patients will also receive 
a follow-up email from the RA that includes user guides for the Fitbit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1312] 2 (see Appendix 3). 
After the 14-day window, the patients will be randomized. Patients randomized to PEAR-003b 
will be contact[CONTACT_676389]-I app.
The RA will collect the following data at enrollment:
•Number of people asked for study participation and number enrolled.
•Number of study participants who required assistance setting up YNHH portal. 
•Number who had YNHH portal who could not be enrolled (e.g. because they had forgotten 
password, no space on mobile device, technical glitch, etc.).
If a patient refuses to participate, then we will note the number of people who refused. If the 
patient is agreeable, we will then administer a short questionnaire to understand their rationale 
for not participating in the study, to understand potential reasons for non-participation. We will 
also ask these people who chose not to participate about basic demographics, if they are willing 
to answer (age, sex, race/ethnicity, major co-morbidities, insurance status). Please see Appendix 
4 for questionnaire.

patient-generated data from the Fitbit into our researcher database using the Hugo platform. 
The enrollment visit is the only time patients will need to come in for an in-person visit. All 
subsequent visits will be completed at home. For all patient-reported outcome measures, we 
will query patients regarding whether they prefer a secure email link or text message link to 
receive questionnaires at baseline, 9, 21, 35, and 61 weeks. If patients do not respond to this 
prompt within 24 hours, they will receive an email reminder. Should there be still be no 
response after an additional 48 hours, the RA will follow up with the patient via phone to ask the 
patient to complete the unanswered survey.
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_676390] 35 and 61 weeks to ascertain any new health 
systems in which they sought care and the Hugo platform will be checked to ensure that data 
from those health systems are included (and patients will be asked to link those health systems 
or provide data, as appropriate). Multiple attempts will be made to contact [CONTACT_676391]. Patients will receive automatic reminders to complete 
questionnaires at 9, 21, 35, and [ADDRESS_914589]-randomization via email. Similarly, patients will 
receive automatic reminders to sync their Fitbit at these time points.

6.3.6 End of Study and Follow-up
After the end of the study (i.e. at [ADDRESS_914591]-randomization), study participants will be asked 
to complete a close-out questionnaire via Hugo (see Appendix 5). They will also be asked at 
what health systems or clinicians from whom they received care over the past 61 weeks 
(including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency department visit), to assess if all pertinent data were 
captured in the Hugo platform. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_914592] will be conducted as intent-to-treat (ITT) to avoid the effects 
of crossover and dropout.[ADDRESS_914593] for dichotomous 
and/or categorical variables and student’s t-tests for continuous variables. If variables are 
deemed as non-parametric, we will use a median test such as a Mann–Whitney U-test, where 
appropriate.
6.4.2 Sample Size Considerations
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/19/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/19/[ADDRESS_914594] sizes with 80% power were conducted with PASS 
software for only the primary outcomes (PASS 15).33 Because the models assume that each 
outcome is normally distributed, the outcome effects represent the average amount each 
outcome is expected to change with incremental shift in any explanatory variable. We will 
recruit a total of 100 participants and will randomly assign them to treatment and control arms 
based on a 50% probability of assignment. We also assume a 10% rate of drop-out between 
baseline and the end of follow-up, resulting in an effective sample size of N=80. Assuming a two-
sided alpha threshold of 0.05, for the main outcome (change in ISI from baseline to 9-weeks 
post-randomization),34 and a power of 90% this sample size will allow us to detect an effect size 
of d=0.52 which is ½ to 1/[ADDRESS_914595] in the main ISI outcome. We further note that this calculation is 
conservative because analysis may optionally draw from outcome values recorded at baseline 
and each follow-up time.  
6.4.3 Planned Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analyses
For the primary endpoint analysis, we will use a t test to compare the ISI scores19 for the 
intervention (PDT + Fitbit) and control group (Fitbit only) at baseline (as this score is a 
continuous variable). We will then use a 2 (group) × 2 (time) repeated measures analysis of 
variance (RM ANOVAs) to compare pre to post changes from baseline to 9-weeks across 
groups.2,4 Paired sample t tests by [CONTACT_676393] (if the overall interaction effect is significant). At weeks 21, 35, and [ADDRESS_914596] 
for the patient-reported outcome. Missing covariates will be set to missing. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Objectives Analyses
For the secondary endpoint analysis regarding the patient reported outcomes, we will calculate 
the change in the PHQ-8,[ADDRESS_914597] randomization (as these are continuous 
variables) and perform a comparison between patients randomized to the intervention (PDT + 
Fitbit) and patients randomized to the control (Fitbit only). Based on our prior work using 
SHUTi,34 we will examine the change in scores between groups using a mixed model repeated 
measures ANOVA 35with an unstructured matrix, and estimated degrees of freedom (df) with 
Satterthwaite’s correction. We will present df alongside F-test statistics and t statistics.

29For the secondary clinical/healthcare utilization outcomes we will compare the PDT to the 
control at all follow-up time points. These outcomes will be defined as: (a) number of outpatient 
visits per patient with primary care physicians, (b) number of outpatient visits per patient with 
specialty care, (c) number of medication refills for sleep per patient, and (d) number of 
medication refills for psychotropic medications per patient. These comparisons will be examined 
using t tests at each time point (as these will be continuous variables). 
For the sleep outcomes,[ADDRESS_914598] randomization comparing PDT to the control 
based on sleep diaries. These outcomes will be defined as: (a) sleep efficiency; (2) sleep onset 
latency [SOL], (3) number of awakenings, (4) sleep quality, and (5) total sleep time (minutes) (6) 
waking after sleep onset [WASO], (7) time in bed. We will examine the change in scores between 
groups using a mixed model repeated measures ANOVA.[ADDRESS_914599] randomization (as these are 
continuous variables) and perform a comparison between patients randomized to the 
intervention (PDT + Fitbit) and patients randomized to the control (Fitbit only). Health utilities 
scores are derived from the SF-6D algorithm as applied to the SF-12 data36. 
For the secondary engagement outcome, we will examine the relationship between engagement 
with PDT and clinical outcomes in the PDT arm at all follow up time points.  Correlations 
between engagement and clinical outcomes will be evaluated using both Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient and Spearman’s rank correlation as follows.  Change from baseline (Follow up – 
baseline) will be calculated for ISI, sleep diary-derived metrics of SOL and WASO, and PHQ-8, at 
both the end of treatment and the end of all follow-ups.  These will be correlated with core 
completion rates, sleep diary completion rate, and the number of times the PDT  is opened. In 
addition, clinical outcomes among those who complete all six cores of treatment will also be 
examined. 
Lastly, the exploratory physical and sleep activity outcomes (measured using Fitbit) will again be 
compared from baseline to 9-weeks, 21-weeks, 35-weeks, and 61-weeks comparing PDT to 
control. These outcomes will be defined as: (a) number of steps per day; (b) sleep [total sleep 
time in minutes], and (c) self-reported metrics such as weight, height, and BMI). We will examine 
the change in scores between groups using a mixed model repeated measures ANOVA.[ADDRESS_914600] is significant.

7.5 Data Collection
Age, gender, date of birth and several categories of health information (provider encounters, 
notes – if available, medication lists, problem lists, family history, allergies, laboratory findings, 
procedures, immunizations, vital signs, and medical record numbers) will be collected via the 
Hugo platform. Patients will also be asked to self-report race, ethnicity, weight and co-
morbidities/pre-existing conditions, in addition to pre-existing conditions pulled into Hugo from 
the EHR. We will also be collecting data provided and synced to the Hugo platform from the and 
Fitbit.
Patient self-reported data collected via Hugo will include insomnia severity using the self-
reported ISI scale,[ADDRESS_914606] 
data on daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (using the ESS),21 stress (measured using PSS-10),22 health-related

relevant to purpose and context; amendable to the application of appropriate analytic methods; 
and interpretable using clinical and scientific judgment. First, the data must be high quality, 
focused on completeness, accuracy, and timeliness. In a recent study published in April 2020 in 
npj Digital Medicine, we demonstrated that the Hugo platform had high levels of completeness 
and accuracy (all >90%). We also found that the data were available in near real-time, therefor 
being timely. However, at baseline, these are EHR data and, thus, will be subject to the 
limitations of EHR data (e.g. these are not designed specifically for research purposes). That said, 
the clinical outcomes that we seek to ascertain via EHR data are focused on healthcare 
utilization, which we think should be accurate (e.g. if a patient had an encounter in an 
Emergency Department). It is likely that some study participants will link data from multiple 
EHRs, and we will seek to understand clinical utilization using the dates of different encounters. 
7.9 Data or Specimen Storage/Security
All patient data will be collected, handled, and stored according the most rigorous accepted

made clear to study participants at enrollment. Patients will be informed that symptoms 
reported in this study are not being monitored or evaluated for any clinical purposes or in any 
timely manner and that any adverse or severe symptoms should be reported directly to their 
physician(s), or emergency room physicians as they would have in the normal course of their 
care.
The study coordinators will regularly monitor the status of the portal data 
(MyChart/pharmacy/Fitbit) coming into the Hugo platform using the Hugo study dashboard only 
available to research staff listed on the IRB. Within this dashboard, the research staff will be able 
to review the connection status of all portals connected to each patient’s Hugo account. Should 
a connectivity issue be noticed by [CONTACT_3647], they will note the connection issue reported by 
[CONTACT_168137], or if multiple participants 
are experiencing the same problem. The research staff will then follow up directly with the Hugo 
support team. 
Once the source of the issue is identified, research staff will follow up with the affected patients 
as needed to correct the issue in a timely fashion. 
Research staff will also keep track of any technical issues reported by [CONTACT_676396]-up period. If the technical issues are not able to be resolved by [CONTACT_16133], or if 
multiple patients report the same problem, the research staff will forward the issue to the Hugo 
support team to identify and correct the issue and in order to follow-up with those patients 
affected.
7.[ADDRESS_914612] of conducting high-quality research at YNHH and Mayo Clinic, as well as 
the collaborative relationships between the investigators, we do not anticipate that any site will 
be discontinued for any reason. If this becomes necessary for any reason, even though we 
maintain near certainty that it will not, then we will cease enrollment at that site and shift to 
other sites.

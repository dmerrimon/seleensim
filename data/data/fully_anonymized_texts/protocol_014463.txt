LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 4 of 123
  
 (0.5 mg/g) (as dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) gel in adolescent subjects 
(aged 12 to 16 years, 11 months) with scalp and body 
psoriasis. 
 
The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of once 
daily use of calcipotriol (50 mcg/g) plus betamethasone 
(0.5 mg/g) (as dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) gel in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 16 years, 11 months) with scalp and body 
psoriasis. 
Methodology: An international, multi-centre, prospective, non-
controlled, open, single-group, 8-week trial in adolescent 
subjects (aged 12 to 16 years,  11 months) with scalp and 
body psoriasis  
Psoriatic lesions on the scalp and body will be treated with calcipotriol (50 mcg/g) plus betamethasone (0.5 mg/g) (as 
dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) gel applied once daily for up to [ADDRESS_973730] will be a 
maximum of 20 weeks, consisting of a screening period of 
7 days to 8 weeks followed by a 4- or 8-week treatment 
period and, if required, a 2-4-week follow-up period. 
 Prior to Visit 1 (Day 0), a wash-out period (up to 8 weeks) 
should be completed if the subject is being treated or has 
recently been treated with an ti-psoriatic treatments or 
other relevant medication, as defined by [CONTACT_121566].  
 
During the trial, the subset of subjects performing HPA 
axis assessments will be allo wed to use non-steroid topi[INVESTIGATOR_714848] (armpi[INVESTIGATOR_10022], groin, under the breasts and in other skin folds around the 
genitals and buttocks).  Subjects not performing HPA axis assessments will be allowed to use any topi[INVESTIGATOR_714849]0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 5 of 123
  
 allowed except potent or very potent (WHO groups III-
IV) corticosteroids to treat psoriasis lesions on the face 
and skin folds. Bath oils and moisturizing soaps are 
allowed. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] D analogues (calcipotriol, 
calcitriol or tacalcitol) are limited to a maximum of 50 g, 
75 g or 100 g of ointment/gel/cream per week depending 
on the subject’s age and body surface area (BSA).  This 
includes the amount of investigational product used.   
The study will consist of a wa sh-out period (if required), 
2 screening visits; SV1 and SV2 (to be conducted within 
8 and 1 weeks prior to Visit 1, respectively) followed by a 
4-or 8-week treatment period (Days 0-56). Subjects whose 
psoriasis is clear after 4-week treatment will stop the 
investigational produc t and leave the tria l. Subjects who 
have signs of psoriasis after 4 weeks of treatment will continue treatment for another 4-week period. During the 
treatment period, the study visits will be on Days 0, 14, 
28, 42 and 56 (Visits 1 to 5).  
 
Each subject will receive the investigational product and 
will be instructed to  apply it once daily.  
 Calcium metabolism evaluation will be performed at SV2 
and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment (Day 28 and 
Day 56). The evaluation will include measurements of 
serum calcium, albumin, phosphate, plasma parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) level and cal culation of the albumin-
corrected serum calcium concentration. Also, 24-hour urine will be collected and urinary volume, calcium-, 
phosphate-, and creatinine excretion will be measured and 
the calcium:creatinine and phosphate:creatinine ratios 
calculated.   
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed to evaluate if any potential adverse events could be correlated to the 
investigational product. A blood sample for  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 6 of 123
  
 pharmacokinetic analysis will be drawn at Visit 3 (Day 
28) for the measurement of plasma LEO [ADDRESS_973731] is at a steady state concentration. 
 In the U.S. only, subjects will perform hypothalamic-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal (HPA) axis function assessments until 
[ADDRESS_973732] their HPA axis function assessed at SV2 and after 
4 and 8 weeks of treatment (Day 28 and Day 56). The 
adrenal function will be asse ssed with a rapid standard 
dose synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (CORTROSYN
®) challenge test. The test consists of 
blood sampling starting at 8 a.m. (± 30 minutes). Following the blood sample, an intravenous bolus injection of 250 mcg CORTROSYN
® is given at time zero 
(t=0). Serum cortisol concentration at [ADDRESS_973733] the stimulat ion induced by [CONTACT_714905]
®. 
Subjects will not be included in  the study if serum cortisol 
concentration at SV2 is 5 mc g/dl or lower before the 
CORTROSYN® injection or if serum cortisol 
concentration, obtained at 30 minutes after 
CORTROSYN® injection, is below or equal to 18 mcg/dl. 
At Week 4, subjects with serum cortisol below or equal to 18 mcg/dl at 30 min af ter administration of 
CORTROSYN
® will discontinue the treatment and will 
perform a follow-up visit 2 (Visit FU2). 
 
Visit FU2 will be conducted for subjects with possible 
HPA axis suppression 28 days after possible suppression 
is reported (i.e. 28 days after Visit 3 or 5). This follow-up 
will involve a repeat HPA axis suppression test to assess if 
the possible suppression has reversed. 
 
A follow-up visit (Visit FU1) will be conducted [ADDRESS_973734] on-treatment visit for subjects with any 
ongoing adverse event(s) classi fied as possibly/probably 
related/not assessable relationship to the investigational  

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973735] on-treatment visit.  
A window of ± 2 days will be allowed for Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 
FU1 and FU2. The overall treatment period should be 4 or 
8 weeks (28 or 56 days ± 2 days). 
Number of subjects  
to be enrolled: In total, a sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to 
ensure [ADDRESS_973736] 30 subjects will be evaluable for 
pharmacokinetic evaluation. 
 
In the U.S. only, subjects will perform hypothalamic-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal (HPA) axis function assessments until [ADDRESS_973737] two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the probability of observing a specific adverse 
event, when [ADDRESS_973738] been 
observed, is approximately 4% assuming a binomial 
distribution. 
 
With 100 subjects and an assumed response rate 
(percentage of subjects who achieve “Clear” or “Almost 
clear” according to the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of disease severity on the body at end of treatment) 
of approximately 30%, the 95% confidence interval for 
the estimated response rate will be approximately ± 9%.

 Statistical methods: The percentages of subjects with a serum cortisol 
concentration ≤18 mcg/dl at 30 minutes, and at both 30 
and 60 minutes, after the ACTH-challenge at Week 4 and Week 8 will be calculated. The mean serum cortisol 
concentration at time 0 and at 30 and 60 minutes after 
ACTH-challenge at baseline (S V2), Week 4 and Week 8, 
respectively, will be calculated.  
The number of subjects experiencing each type of adverse 
event and each type of a dverse drug reaction will be 
tabulated.  
The mean change from baseline (SV2) to Week 4 and 
Week 8 in haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis parameters except in the urinary glucose and ketones will 
be calculated. For the albu min-corrected serum calcium 
and 24-hour urinary calcium ex cretion, the mean change 
from baseline to end of treatme nt will also be calculated 
and the 95% confidence interv al of mean change from 
baseline to Week 4 and Week 8 and end of treatment will 
be presented. For the urinary calcium:creatinine ratio, the 
95% confidence interval of m ean change from baseline to

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973765] of the Trial 
This clinical trial will be conducted to conf orm to the principles of the World Medical 
Association (WMA), Declaration of Helsinki, Ethical Princi ples for Medical Research 
Involving Human Subjects adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WM A General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 
June [ADDRESS_973766] revised in Seoul in Oc tober 2008 by [CONTACT_89290] (see 
Appendix II ). 
5.[ADDRESS_973767] on the 
quality of life comparable with that observed  in other chronic medical conditions such as 
diabetes and depression ( 1) (2).  
Approximately 35% of patients with psoriasis develop the disease before the age of 20 and 
25% are diagnosed between 10 and 19 years of age ( 3). Involvement of the scalp is more 
common in children (4 ) (5). Based on this, it is evident that scalp psoriasis is also prevalent in 
the adolescent age group (12-17 years).  
Most preparations are greasy and messy to apply, have an unpleasant smell and may cause 
staining of clothes and fabrics and skin irritation ( 6). Patient’s compliance is therefore often 
poor, leading to a bad th erapeutic result. Therefore, there is a need for a patient acceptable 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_714857]. 
LEO [ADDRESS_973768] containing the vitamin D 3 analogue 
calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847], for topi[INVESTIGATOR_714858] 18 years and above.  
Daivobet® gel was approved for the treatment of scalp psoriasis in adults in several countries 
in the EU and the US in 2008 and is launched under the trademarks Daivobet®, Dovobet®, 
Taclonex®, and Xamiol®. Since then it has been approve d in the remaining EU countries 
(2009) and in several other countries in the rest  of the world (more than 40 countries outside 
EU), including Canada and Australia; approvals ar e pending in several count ries in the rest of 
the world. The product has been launched with the indication scalp psor iasis in adults since 
2008.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 29 of 123
  
 The marketing authorisation application for treatment of ‘non-scalp’ psoriasis vulgaris in 
adults was approved in several countries in the EU in July 2009. Since then, the indication of 
non-scalp psoriasis vulgaris in adults has been approved in the remaining EU countries 
(Dec 2011), in US October 2012, and in several other countries in the rest of the world. 
Approvals are pending in several countries in the rest of the world. The product was launched 
in the first European country, Denmark, in March 2010 under the trademark Daivobet® gel. 
Two non-controlled trials, MBL 0801 and MBL0412 INT, in adolescent subjects (aged 12-
17 years) with psoriasis on the scalp have recently been completed. In a total of 
109 adolescent subjects using up to 69 g/week , LEO gel was safe and effective in the 
treatment of psoriasis vulgari s on the scalp.  The effects on calcium metabolism were 
investigated; no cases of hypercalcaemia and no clin ically relevant changes in urinary calcium 
were reported. The adrenal response to ACTH  challenge was assessed in a subset of 30 
patients; one patient showed a decrease in cort isol response to ACTH challenge after 4 weeks 
of treatment which was considered mild ( 7) (8). 
All subjects in the trial will receive LEO [ADDRESS_973769]  been shown to be safe and effective in 
adults for the approved products Taclonex® and Xamiol®.  
At the end of the trial, subjects will have received treatment with LEO [ADDRESS_973770] the trial and, if required, resume the treatment they received prior to the wash-out 
period or start a treatment according to the i nvestigator’s discretion, whichever is most 
appropriate. The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of  the subjects will give informed  consent, and subjects must 
give their assent, or subjects may give info rmed consent as appropriate and according to 
national laws and regulations. 
Laboratory evidence of adrenal insu fficiency due to the use of t opi[INVESTIGATOR_81977] ( 9), due to systemic absorption of  the corticosteroid.  LEO [ADDRESS_973771] involves injec ting a synthetic subunit of ACTH 
(CORTROSYN®) into the subject, and measuring the co rtisol produced by [CONTACT_234127] 
30 and 60 minutes after the injection.  
The use of CORTROSYN® in this trial will be in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_714859] ( Appendix III ); therefore this is expected to be of low risk.   
The risk of hypercalcemia due to systemic ab sorption of the calcipotri ol component of LEO 
[ZIP_CODE] gel is expected to be low when the medication is used in the doses specified in the trial. 
Any potential effects of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel on calcium metabolism will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_714911] -phosphate and plasma parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) and the urinary calcium-, phos phate-, and creatinine excretion based on 
collection of 24-hour urine and the calcium:creatinine and phosphate:creatinine, ratios will be 
calculated before, during and at the end of treatment.  
The expected total blood volume collected wi ll be approximately 46.5 ml for subjects 
performing HPA axis assessments and 31.5 ml  for subjects not performing HPA axis 
assessments. This excludes any follow-up assessment of abnormal values. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_714860] (sub)investigator’s discretion. 
Recruitment for the trial will be continued until  100 subjects are available for evaluation of 
calcium metabolism.  This includes the 30 subjec ts (in the US) without adrenal suppression at 
baseline who is to undergo ACTH-challenge test at end of treatment (Visit 3 or 5). 
Since all subjects will receive the LEO [ADDRESS_973772] wi th paediatric experience during the entire course of the trial. 
Subjects performing HPA axis assessments w ill be allowed to use non-steroid topi[INVESTIGATOR_714861].  Subjects not performing HPA axis asse ssments will be allowed to use any topi[INVESTIGATOR_714862] t (WHO groups III-IV) corticosteroids to treat 
psoriasis lesions on the face and skin folds. Bath oils and moisturizing soaps are allowed.   

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973773] Information and Informed Consent 
The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of subjects will receive written and verbal information 
concerning the trial or subjects may give info rmed consent as appropriate and according to 
national laws or regulations. This information will emphasise that participation in the trial is 
voluntary and that the subject may withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason. The 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be given an opportunity to ask questions and will be given 
sufficient time to consider before consenting. Signed and dated informed consent for the subject to participate in the trial will be obtai ned from the parent(s)/legal guardian(s), or by 
[CONTACT_714912], prior to any trial related procedure 
being carried out.  
All subjects will also receive appropriate wr itten and verbal information, be given an 
opportunity to ask questions and sufficient time  to consider, before providing written assent. 
The subject’s decision not to participate or to wi thdraw will be respected, even if consent is 
given by [CONTACT_7071](s)/legal guardian(s).  
If during the trial a subject who has previously given assent becomes legally emancipated i.e. 
ceases to be a minor, the subject should be asked to provide their written consent.  
All Investigators will sign an  “Investigator’s Agreement” to confirm the above. 
5.5 Handling of Personal Data 
Subjects (or their legally acceptable representati ve) shall be asked to consent that their 
personal data are recorded, collected, processe d and may be transferred to EU and non-EU 
countries in accordance with any national legisl ation regulating privacy and data protection. 
Personal data shall be handled and processed by a ll relevant parties involved in the clinical 
trial in accordance with any nati onal legislation regulating privacy  and data protection as well 
as in accordance with the gene ral terms and conditions of the authorisation granted by [CONTACT_714913] A/S as set forth in the attached Appendix I .

 Before the initiation of any clinical trial rela ted activities by [CONTACT_473]/clinical trial 
committee(s)/LEO Pharma A/S affiliate(s)/CRO(s) listed above, the relevant parties must 
have entered into a written agr eement regulating those activities. 
7 Insurance 
LEO Pharma A/S has taken out relevant insura nces covering the subjects in the present 
clinical trial in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
[ADDRESS_973782] common chroni c skin diseases, with a prevalence generally 
estimated at between 1 to 3%  of the world’s population ( 10). Psoriasis is characterised by 
[CONTACT_714914], red and scaly, and may itch. This appearance is produced by a greatly increased rate of epi[INVESTIGATOR_714863]. De rmal blood vessels are dilated and there is 
infiltration of the skin with immunologically active cells ( 11) (12). The pathogenesis is 
incompletely understood, but the disease is t hought to be triggere d by [CONTACT_714915] i nvolvement of T cells, dendritic  cells, and various cytokines 
and chemochines ( 13). 
 
The most common clinical type of psoriasis,  affecting 80-90% of pa tients, is psoriasis 
vulgaris (plaque-type psoriasis) (14). Sites of predilection are the hairy scalp (30% initially and 75% over the course of the disease), the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees and 
the sacral region ( 15). The nails are involved in about 30% of patients with psoriasis and in 
about 20% psoriatic arthritis arises, usually many years after the initial cutaneous 
manifestation.  
Psoriasis can be treated either  by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_8588], phototherapy, or by [CONTACT_714916] ( 10) 
(16). Systemic treatments and phototherapy are generally reserved fo r extensive disease 
unresponsive to topi[INVESTIGATOR_714864] e to concerns over toxicity ( 13) (16 ). 
 Most preparations are greasy and messy to a pply, have an unpleasant smell and may cause 
staining of clothes and fabrics and skin irritation ( 6). Patient’s compliance is therefore often 
poor, leading to a bad therapeutic result. 
 
There is a need for a patien t acceptable topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786].  

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973783] Description 
LEO [ZIP_CODE] (Calcipotriol plus Beta methasone Dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) Gel  
LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel, containing calcipotriol 50 mc g/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as 
dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]), is a topi [INVESTIGATOR_714865]. It obtained marketing approval in 2008 in the U.S., Canada, and 16 European 
countries, and since then has been marketed in the U.S. and Europe under the trade names 
Taclonex® Scalp Topi[INVESTIGATOR_714866]®/Dovobet®/Xamiol® gel, respectively. In 
this Clinical Study Report, ‘LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel’ is used  in text ‘LEO [ZIP_CODE]’ is used in the tables, 
figures, and listings. 
 Calcipotriol is a vitamin D
[ADDRESS_973784] been conducted with LEO  [ZIP_CODE] gel as described in the Investigator’s 
Brochure. Overall, it can be concluded that LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel is considered to be effective and 
safe in the treatment of psor iasis vulgaris on scalp and body. 
 
8.3 Trial Rationale 
The FDA has approved Taclonex® Gel for the treatment of body psoriasis in adults. The 
objective of the present phase [ADDRESS_973785]-marketing commitment to  the FDA (for NDA 22-185). The FDA requires 
the trial to be conducted in 100 evaluable paediatric patients (ages 12 to 16 years, 11 months) with psoriasis vulgaris on the scalp and body, to  evaluate the safety and effect of Taclonex
® 
Gel on calcium metabolism. In a subset of a least 30 patients treated under maximal use 
conditions, evaluation of the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_714867]. 
LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel has marketing approval in many count ries for the treatment of scalp psoriasis 
in adults. Two non-controlled trials, MBL 0801 and MBL 0412 INT, in adolescent subjects (aged 12-17 years) have recently been completed. In these trials in a total of 109 adolescent 
subjects, LEO gel was safe and effective in th e treatment of psoriasis vulgaris on the scalp ( 7) 
(8). 
  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 37 of 123
  
 Approximately 35% of patients with psoriasis develop the disease before the age of 20 and 
25% are diagnosed between 10 and 19 years of age ( 3). Involvement of the scalp is more 
common in children (4 ) (5). Based on this, it is evident that scalp psoriasis is also prevalent in 
the adolescent age group (12-17 years).  
Only 10% of psoriasis patients devel op psoriasis before the age of ten ( 3). The clinical 
appearance of psoriasis in child ren (ages 2-11 years) may differ  from the classical pi[INVESTIGATOR_714868]. Facial psoriasis is more  common in children than in adults and may be 
the only site affected; guttate and flexural forms are particularly common in children ( 20) (21) 
(22) (23 ). Children have a higher body surf ace area (BSA) to body mass ratio than 
adolescents and adults which increases the potential for adverse drug reactions due to 
absorption of topi[INVESTIGATOR_191962] d compounds through the skin ( 24). This limits the use of potent 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_714869] (25). Hence children below [ADDRESS_973786] or observed by [CONTACT_714917]. In addition, any effects resulting 
from systemic absorption of  the active components, betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_714870], will be evaluated by [CONTACT_714918], 
respectively. 
 
Laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency due to  the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_81977] ( 9).  This is due to systemic absorption of the corticosteroid, which then 
induces suppression of the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_168445] y-adrenal (HPA) axis due to a negative 
feedback effect on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_168445] y gland and the hypothalamus ( 9) (26). This results in a 
decrease in the secretion of ACTH from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_304]. The adrenal glands depend on 
ACTH as a tropic hormone in such a way that  ACTH deficiency results in a reversible 
inability to produce cortisol (27). Hence, the adrenal glands lose the capacity to produce 
cortisol in response to an ACTH-challenge. Adrenal function can therefore be measured by 
[CONTACT_82037] a synthetic  subunit of ACTH into the subject,  and then measuring the production 
of cortisol by [CONTACT_714919]. A serum cortisol concentration of 18 mcg/dl or less at 30 and 60 minutes afte r the injection indicates possible adrenal 
suppression ( 26). 
  

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973787] in a previous trial ( 28). The subjects included in the trial had extensive 
psoriasis on both scalp (at least 30% of scalp affected) and no n-scalp regions of the body (15-
30% of body surface area). Subjects applied LE O [ADDRESS_973788] Daivobet®/Taclonex® ointment to the lesions on the trunk 
and limbs. After a total of 32 subjects had received treatment with LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel for 4 
weeks, 5 had a serum cortisol concentration ≤18mcg/dl at 30 minutes after ACTH-challenge, 
and out of 11 subjects who continued treatment fo r 8 weeks, 2 subjects had a serum cortisol of 
≤18 mcg/dl at 30 minutes after ACTH challenge . The cortisol value was >18mcg/dl at 60 
minutes after ACTH-challenge for all subjects.  
 
In the two trials MBL 0801 a nd MBL 0412 INT, no cases of hype rcalcaemia and no clinically 
relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported.  The adrena l response to ACTH challenge 
was measured in 30 patients; one patient showed  a decrease in cortisol response to ACTH 
challenge after 4 weeks of treatment which was considered to be mild ( 7) (8). 
 In the present study LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel will be applied to lesions on both scalp and body. The 
risk of adrenal suppression with LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel is expected to be low with LEO [ZIP_CODE] being 
applied under maximal use conditions as system ic exposure is known to be low and the drug 
concentration is expected to be below the lim it of quantification (Inve stigator’s Brochure). 
 Subjects participating in the present study will perform ACTH-challenge test before and after 
treatment. The pre-treatment test is to ensure that adrenal function is normal before starting 
investigational product. Serum cortisol concentrations at  30 and 60 minutes after injection 
will be measured in order to show the maximum cortisol level achieved ( 26). 
 
Overdosage with topi[INVESTIGATOR_714871] ( 27), due to the systemic 
absorption of calcipotriol, which then affects calcium metabolism as it is a vitamin D analogue. However, extensive experience with topi[INVESTIGATOR_714872] (maximum weekly dose in adults of 10 0 g of a 50 mcg/g concentration). Doses up to 
[ADDRESS_973789] been used with serum calcium remaining within the normal range ( 29). 
 
Two studies with calcipo triol ointment have been conducted in children 2-14 years of age and 
did not show effects on calcium metabolism ( 30) (31). One trial with Daivobet
® Ointment, 
MCB 0501 INT, has been conducted in adolescent subjects and did not show any effects on 
calcium or HPA axis.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 39 of 123
  
  
Calcium metabolism will be evaluated in the present study by 24-hour urinary collection and 
measurement of serum calcium, -phosphate a nd plasma PTH before, during and/or after 
treatment. 24-hour urine will be collected and the urinary calcium-, phosphate- and creatinine 
excretion will be measured and the calcium: creatinine and phosphate:creatinine ratios 
calculated. Subjects who report an incomplete  24-hour urinary collection will be excluded 
from the analyses of 24-hour urinary calcium  and phosphate excretion but will still be 
analysed for calcium:creatinine and phosphate:c reatinine. To identify any severe, non-
reported sampling errors the daily creatinine ex cretion/kg body weight will be calculated as 
proposed by [CONTACT_82067]. ( 32).   
 It is well established that there is a relati onship between dietary calcium intake and the 
urinary calcium excretion in adults. However, in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_81981], it appears that only dietary calcium intake a bove a certain threshold of approximately 1500 mg/day will 
result in an increase in urinary calcium excretion ( 33). As this study includes adolescents [ADDRESS_973790]’s normal diet w ill be done. As dairy products account for 
approximately 73% of the total dietary calcium co ntent, and as the calcium from other sources 
such as vegetables and grains are less easily absorbed ( 34), the review will focus on the intake 
of dairy products. The subjects will be asked to keep a diary of the daily intake of dairy products and calcium-fortified products (e.g. brea d, cereals, orange juice or soy milk). The 
number of daily servings of calcium defined as one cup (240 ml) or 1.5 ounces of cheese 
(43 g) in dairy products such as milk, yoghurt or  cheese or of a calcium -fortified product with 
corresponding calcium content (300 mg calcium/cup) will be estimated ( 35). The subjects will 
be asked to keep the same number of daily servings three days prio r to and during each 24-
hour urine collection. The number of daily ca lcium servings should not exceed five (i.e. 
1500 mg calcium). 
 
The combination of high calcium intake with vitamin D supplementation, or extreme calcium 
intake alone, has been shown to significan tly increase urinary calcium in adults (36 ). Hence, 
the use of calcium or vitamin D supplem ents will be excluded in this study. 
  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 40 of 123
  
 Subjects will apply the LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel once daily  for up to 8 weeks. This application 
frequency and treatment duration has been shown to be safe and effective in adults with 55-
70% of subjects achieving controlled disease after 4-week treatment ( 37) ( 38). Only subjects 
who have signs of scalp and/or body psoriasi s after [ADDRESS_973791] 
required is expected to decrea se with time as lesions heal, continued treatment for up to 8 
weeks is expected to be safe in those subjects who need it.   
 
The maximum weekly dosage approved for adults is 100 g. In the present trial, the maximum 
weekly dose will be determined by [CONTACT_714920]. For subjects aged 12 to 14 years 
with a BSA ≤ 1.3 m2, the maximum weekly dosage will be 50 g of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel per week. 
For subjects aged 12 to 14 years with a BSA > 1.3 m2 and subjects aged 15 to 16 years, 11 
months with a BSA ≤ 1.7 m2, the maximum weekly dosage will be 75 g of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel per 
week. For subjects aged 15 to 16 year s, 11 months with a BSA > 1.[ADDRESS_973792] an extent of scalp and body (trunk and /or 
limbs) psoriasis of 10-35% BSA.  In addition,  subjects performing HPA axis assessments are 
to have an extent of scalp psoriasis that is more than or equal to 20% of the scalp area.  
Subjects not performing HPA axis assessments are to  have an extent of scalp psoriasis that is 
more than or equal to 10% of the scalp area. The disease severity of  body psoriasis and scalp 
psoriasis is to at least moderate according to the investigator’s global assessment. It is expected that many adolescent subjects with psor iasis will have less extensive and less severe 
disease. However, since the main purpose of the pr esent study is to evaluate the safety of the 
investigational product, th e exposure to treatment has to be as close to maximum as possible. 
 A total of [ADDRESS_973793]. A blood sample (2 x 6mL) for 
pharmacokinetic evaluation will be drawn at Visit 3 (4 weeks of treatment) prior to the 
application of LEO [ADDRESS_973794] on (or be affected by) the ACTH -challenge test (e.g., corticosteroids, enzymatic 
inductors, cytochrome P450 inhibitors, hypoglyc emic sulfonamides, antidepressive medica-
tions, estrogen), calcium metabolism (e.g., vitamin D, calcium supplements, antacids, 
diuretics and antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_23698]) or the psoriasis to be trea ted with investigational product (e.g., 
systemic/topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/ ultraviolet anti-psoriatic  therapy, although emollients are allowed). 
 
9 Trial Objectives 
9.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety  of once daily use of calcipotriol (50 mcg/g) 
plus betamethasone (0.5 mg/g) (as dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_617131]) gel in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 16 
years, 11 months) with scalp and body psoriasis. 
9.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objective is to ev aluate the efficacy of once da ily use of calcipotriol (50 
mcg/g) plus betamethasone (0.5 mg/g) (as dipr opi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) gel in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 
16 years, 11 months) with scalp and body psoriasis. 
10  Investigational Plan 
10.1 Trial Design 
This will be an international,  multi-centre, prospective, non-c ontrolled, open, single-group, 8-
week trial in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 16 years, 11 months) with scalp and body 
psoriasis. 
 
The subjects will receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_714873] 50 mcg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 
mg/g (as dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) gel once daily for up to 8 weeks.  
Washout/Screening Period
 
Depending on the prior use of disallowed treatments, the washout/screening period will last for [ADDRESS_973795] ad ministration of LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel (Visit 1).  
  

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973796] be obtained from the 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of the subject, or by [CONTACT_423] (as appropriate and according to 
national laws and regulations). Written assent should also be obtained from the subject. There 
are two screening visits: Screening visit 1 (S V1) and screening Visit 2 (SV2). Depending on 
the subjects’ use of excluded treatments, SV1 is  performed up to 7 weeks before SV2; SV2 is 
performed at [ADDRESS_973797] for up to 8 weeks. There are up to 5 visits: Visit 1 (day 0), Visit 
2 (day 14), Visit 3 (day 28), Visit 4 (day 42) and Visit 5 (day 56). Visits 2-5 should be 
performed within ±2 days of the scheduled time relative to Visit 1; if they are outside this window, the (sub)investigator should record th e reason in the subject’ s medical record.   
 LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel will be applied onc e daily to scalp psoriasis lesions. Subjects should be 
instructed to discontinue treatm ent on individual lesions if/whe n a lesion has cleared. Subjects 
whose psoriasis clears after 4-week treatment will stop the investigational product and leave 
the trial.  
 
Subjects who have psoriasis after 4 weeks of treatment will continue treatment for another 4-
week period. 
 
Subjects whose psoriasis clears at Visit 2 or Visit 4 according to the (sub)investigator should 
discontinue treatment but will stay in the study. During periods of discontinuation of 
treatment the subject should restart the treatment if psoriasis reappears. 
 
Follow-up
 
If applicable, the treatment period will be followed by a follow-up (FU)  period consisting of 
visit FU1 and/or visit FU2.  
 
Visit FU1 will take place [ADDRESS_973798] visit in the treatment period, but only if there 
was an ongoing adverse event at this time of pos sible/probable/not assessable relationship to 
the investigational produ ct. At the (sub)investigator’s disc retion, the information required at 
this visit may be obtained over the telephone, an d the subject need not make the visit. FU1 
should also be performed if album in corrected serum calcium is above the reference range at 
the last on-site visit. A new blood sample should then be collected. 
  

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973799] showed  a serum cortisol concentration ≤ 18 mcg/dl at 30 minutes after 
ACTH-challenge. 
 
Visits FU1 and FU2 should be performed within ±2 days of the scheduled time; if they are 
outside this window, the qualified site staff person should record the reason in the subject’s 
medical record/source document.  
For details, see Section 10.[ADDRESS_973800] 4 days between SV1 a nd SV2 so dietary information (diary) can be 
collected.

estimated response rate will be approximately ± 9%.  
Each centre should aim to enroll a minimum of three subjects. As the subjects are anticipated 
to be difficult to recruit, the suggested mini mum number of subjects per centre is based on 
practical considerations rather than statisti cal robustness of estimates given per centre.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Precautions 
Prior to injection of CORTROSYN®, the investigator and staff mu st be prepared to treat any 
possible anaphylactic/allergic/hype rsensitivity reaction. Severe  anaphylactic reactions to 
CORTROSYN® can be minimised by [CONTACT_714927], urtica ria, pruritus, flushing of the face, malaise or 
dyspnoea. In the rare event of a serious allerg ic/anaphylactic reaction, local procedures should 
be followed and IM/IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (adrena line), IV high dose corticosteroids, IV 
antihistamines and intravenous fl uids must be readily availa ble and immediately used as 
appropriate. Protection of the ai rway must also be considered and managed appropriately.  
Because of the risk of an allergic reaction,  the injections should be given under medical 
supervision and the subject kept under observation for approximately one hour. If subjects experience an allergic reaction to CORTROSYN
® they should be withdrawn from the trial. 
Repeat administration may increase the risk of hypersensitivity. Subjects should be instructed to inform subsequent physicians of previous use of corticotropic hormones. See the 
Prescribing Information for CORTROSYN
® in Appendix III for further details. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug Accountability 
The investigator is fully re sponsible for the CORTROSYN® at the trial site. Dispensing of

rich nutrients in the 4-day period prior to SV2 (3 days prior to and during the baseline 24-hour 
urinary collection).   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 64 of 123
  
 At SV2, the number of daily servings of dair y (or calcium fortified) products defined as one 
cup (240 ml) of milk or yoghurt, 1.5 ounces (43 g) of cheese or any calcium-fortified product 
with a calcium content of 300 mg/c up will be estimated. The subjec t will be instructed that the 
number of daily calcium servings should not ex ceed five. Also the subject should keep the 
intake of calcium-rich nutrients the same three days prior to and during each subsequent 24-
hour urine collection. At the following visit,  i.e. Visit 3 and Visit 5 respectively, the 
(sub)investigator/site staff should review the inta ke of calcium-rich nutrients with the subject. 
Based on the diary entries the (sub)investigator/site staff should estimate the number of daily 
calcium servings for each day and these will be recorded in the CRF.

10.8.3  Clinical Assessment 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Investigator Assessments 
The (sub)investigator will make the clinical assessments listed below. Ideally, all assessments for a subject should be made by [CONTACT_63931] (sub)investigator. 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of Di sease Severity – Scalp Psoriasis and Body 
Psoriasis 
At SV2 and Visits 1 to 5, and early withdrawal (if applicable), the (sub)investigator will make 
a global assessment of the dis ease severity of the scalp psoriasis and body psoriasis 
(separately) by [CONTACT_121576] 5-point scale below. The assessment will be based on the condition 
of the disease at the time of ev aluation and not in relation to th e condition at a previous visit. 
(0) Clear Plaque thickening = no elevat ion or thickening over normal skin 
Scaling = no evidence of scaling Erythema = none (no residual red coloration but post-inflammatory 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_22765]) 
 
(1) Almost clear Plaque thickening = none or possible th ickening but difficult to ascertain 
whether there is a slight elevation above normal skin level  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 65 of 123
  
 Scaling =  none or residual surface dryness and scaling  
Erythema = light pi[INVESTIGATOR_22766] 
 
(2) Mild Plaque thickening = s light but definite elevation  
Scaling = fine scales partially  or mostly covering lesions  
Erythema = light red coloration  
(3) Moderate Plaque thickening = moderate elevation with rounded or sloped edges  
Scaling = most lesions at least partially covered  
Erythema = definite red coloration 
 
(4) Severe Plaque thickening = marked or ve ry marked elevation typi[INVESTIGATOR_180391] = non-tenacious or thick tenaci ous scale, covering most or all of 
the lesions  
Erythema = very bright red coloration;  extreme red coloration; or deep red 
coloration 
 
Note : IGA of the scalp should include all
 scalp psoriasis lesions, defined as those areas of the 
scalp where there are any signs of redness, th ickness or scaliness caused by [CONTACT_22803]. 
The scalp is defined by [CONTACT_82046]. Parts of scalp psoriasis lesions that extend outside the 
defined area of the scalp should not  be included in the assessments.  
At SV2 and Visit [ADDRESS_973845] as moderate  in order to meet the inclusion criteria.  
 Subjects with disease severity classified as “Clear” or “A lmost clear” disease after the 
treatment period will be rated as having “Controlled disease”. 
 
Investigator’s Assessment of the Extent of Psoriasis Vulgaris 
In order to obtain baseline data of psoriatic se verity for all the subjects enrolled in the trial, 
the (sub)investigator will also assess the extent of the subject’s  total psoriatic involvement at 
SV2 and Visit 1. 
 
The total psoriatic involve ment (e.g., the arms, the legs, the trunk, the scalp and the face) will 
be recorded as a percentage of the total BSA, estimating that the surface of the subject’s full, 
flat palm (including the five fingers) corre lates to approximately 1% of the BSA.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 66 of 123
  
  
Investigator’s Assessment of the Extent of Scalp Psoriasis 
A baseline assessment of the extent of scalp psoriasis as percentage of the total scalp area will 
be done at SV2 and Visit 1, estimating that the surface of the subjec t’s full, flat palm 
(including the five fingers) correlates to  approximately 25% of the scalp area. 
 
Investigator’s assessment of the extent and sev erity of clinical signs of psoriasis vulgaris 
(Redness, Thickness, Scaliness) 
At SV2 and Visits 1 to 5 and early withdrawal (if applicable), th e (sub) investigator will make 
assessments of the extent and severity of clinical signs of the subject’s  psoriasis on specific 
areas of the body in terms of three clinical  signs: redness, thickne ss and scaliness.  
 
The extent  of psoriatic involvement will be recorded for each of the four areas: head*, 
arms**, trunk*** and legs**** using the following scale: 
0  =  no involvement 1  =  < 10% 
2  =  10 - 29% 
3  =  30 - 49% 
4  =  50 - 69% 
5  =  70 - 89% 
6  =  90 - 100% 
 
*) head includes the neck  **) arms include hands 
***) trunk includes flexures 
****) legs include buttocks and feet 
 
The severity  of the psoriatic lesions in each of the f our areas will be recorded for each of the 
signs of redness, thickness and scaliness. For ea ch clinical sign, a single score, reflecting the 
average severity of all psoriatic lesions on the given body region, will be determined 
according to the scale below:  
 
Redness 
0 = none (no erythema) 
1 = mild (faint erythema, pi[INVESTIGATOR_82005]) 
2 = moderate (definite light red erythema) 3 = severe (dark red erythema)  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 67 of 123
  
 4 = very severe (very dark red erythema) 
 
Thickness 
0 = none (no plaque elevation) 
1 = mild (slight, barely perceptible elevation) 
2 = moderate (definite elevation but not thick) 
3 = severe (definite elevation, thick plaque with sharp edge) 
4 = very severe (very thic k plaque with sharp edge) 
 
Scaliness 
0 = none (no scaling) 
1 = mild (sparse, fine-scale lesions, only partially covered) 
2 = moderate (coarser scales , most of lesions covered) 
3 = severe (entire lesion co vered with coarse scales) 
4 = very severe (very thick co arse scales, possibly fissured) 
 
PASI is calculated using the formula given be low based on the Investigator’s assessment of 
the extent and severity of the disease locally (head, trunk, arms, legs). 
The following formula will be used to calculate the P ASI: 
 
Head 0.1 (R + T + S)E = W Arms 0.2 (R + T + S)E = X 
Trunk 0.3 (R + T + S)E = Y 
Legs 0.4 (R + T + S)E = Z 
 Where: R = score for redness; T = score for thickness; S = score for scaliness; E = 
score for extent  
The sum of W+X + Y + Z gives the total P ASI, which can range from 0 to 72.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject Assessments 
The subjects will make the following clinical assessments: 
Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Seve rity – Scalp Psoriasis and Body Psoriasis 
At SV2 and Visits 1 to 5, and early withdrawal  (if applicable), the subject will make a global 
assessment of the disease severity of scalp psor iasis and body psoriasis (separately) by [CONTACT_82044] 5-point scale below.

weekly intervals, until the adrenal suppression resolves (i.e., serum cortisol concentration 
>18mcg/dl at 30 minutes after the ACTH-challenge).  
The following procedures should be performed pr ior to the ACTH-challenge tests at SV2 and 
Visit 3 and 5: Blood pressure/heart rate m easurement, blood/urine sampling for central 
laboratory analysis (haematology/biochemistry/uri nalysis) and urine pregnancy test (in female 
subjects of child-bearing potential).    
To perform the ACTH-challenge test, a 2.5 ml sample of venous blood will be drawn at 08.00 
a.m. ±30 minutes. This sample is also the one on which the biochemistry analyses are performed, as detailed above. After this, CORTROSYN® is injected, as described in Section  
10.7. Two further 2.5 ml samples of venous bl ood will be drawn exactly 30 and 60 minutes 
after the injection (counting from  the end of the period over which the injection is given). 
Serum cortisol concentrations will be determined for each blood sample by [CONTACT_15622].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Local Analysis 
A urine pregnancy test will be performed at the trial site at SV2, Visit [ADDRESS_973856] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can ther efore be any unfavourable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom,  or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) produc t, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  (ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 
E6 (R1)).  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is a ny untoward medical occurrence that

Global Pharmacovigilance, LEO Pharma A/S is re sponsible for the assessment of headquarter 
expectedness according to LEO Pharma A/S procedures. The relevant reference document for 
this clinical trial is Investigator’s Brochure, edition 12 and subsequent updates as agreed between the head of Medical Departme nt, and the medical director, Global 
Pharmacovigilance, LEO Pharma A/S.  
At all visits, the subject will be asked a non-leading question by [CONTACT_093]: “How have 
you felt since I saw you last?” No specific symptoms will be asked for. If there are no AEs to record, no further questions will be asked and “NO” should be stated. In 
case there are one or more AEs to record, “YES ” should be stated and the investigator will 
record the event term, intensity, duration, suspected causal relationship to the investigational 
product and outcome. 
It is important that the investigator also obs erves the subject for any changes not reported by 
[CONTACT_73319]. Only medically qualified pe rsonnel must assess AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Adverse Events 
Events reported by [CONTACT_714929] e (sub)investigator and that fall into any of 
the above definitions must be recorded on the adverse event page of the CRF and should be 
described in the following manner: 
 
The nature  of the event will be described in preci se English medical terminology (i.e. not 
necessarily the exact words used by [CONTACT_70579] t). Whenever possible, a specific diagnosis 
should be stated (e.g. allergic contact [CONTACT_8748]).  

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973857] be part of the a dverse event description and 
may be described as either the face, scalp or trunk/limbs. Additionally, the location will be 
described using the following terminology:  
 
 lesional/perilesional ( ≤2 cm from the border of lesion(s)  treated with investigational 
product) or  
 distant  (>2 cm from the lesion border) 
 
The intensity  of the event will be described in terms of mild, moderate or severe according to 
the investigator’s clinical judgement. 
  Mild: The adverse event does not interfere in  a significant manner with the subject’s 
normal functioning level and requi res no medical intervention. 
 Moderate:  The adverse event interferes with th e subject’s normal functioning level and 
may or may not require medical intervention. 
 Severe:  The adverse event produces significant impa irment of the subject’s functioning or 
requires medical intervention. 
 
The duration  of the event will be reported as the start date and stop date of the event. 
 
The causal relation  of the event to the use of the inve stigational product w ill be described in 
terms of probable, possible, not related or  not assessable according to the following: 
 
Probably related 
 Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from  administration of the investigational 
product 
 Could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_46897]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_714884] 
 Follows a known pattern of respons e to the investigational product

factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_714884] 
 Does not  follow a known pattern of respons e to the investigational product 
 
Not assessable 
 The adverse event cannot yet be judged otherwise because present information is 
insufficient or contradictory. A final assessm ent (i.e. probably, possibly or not related) 
shall be made as more information becomes available, at the latest when the subject has completed the trial. 
 The outcome  of the event will be classified and handled as follows: 
 
Recovered/resolved The event has stopped. The stop date of the event  
must be recorded. 
Recovering/resolving The subject is clearly recove ring from an event. The 
event is, however, not yet completely resolved. 
Follow-up on the event is required until final 
outcome is established. 
Not recovered/not resolved Event is still ongoing.  
Follow-up on the event is required until final outcome is established. 
Recovered with sequelae The event ha s reached a state where no further 
changes are expected and the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after 
stroke. 
The stop date of the event must be recorded. 
Fatal The subject has died as a consequence of the event.  
Date of death is recorded as stop date for the adverse event.  

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973858] has completed the clinical trial,  the investigator should follow up for outcome 
on all non-serious adverse events classified as possibly/probably related to the investigational 
product or not assessable for 14 ± [ADDRESS_973859].

All other relevant reports of diagnostic procedures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], autopsy reports etc. must 
be included, as applicable or upon re quest from Global Pharmacovigilance. 
The IRB(s)/IEC(s), regulatory authorities a nd concerned investigator s will be notified of 
SAEs according to current regulation and local requirements. 
All Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse R eactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are subject to expedited

10.8.7  Source Data 
Source data: All information in original  records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_714886], observations, or other activitie s in a clinical trial necessary for the recon-
struction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original 
records or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).  (ICH E6, 1.51). 
Source documents:  Original documents, data, and record s (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical 
and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, s ubjects diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data fr om automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_35418], microfiches, photographic 
negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-ra ys, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico-techni cal departments involv ed in the clinical 
trial).  (ICH E6, 1.52). 
Source Data Verification (SDV) is a key function in assuring the sponsor that clinical trial 
information is recorded and handled in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation 
and verification. Monitors will, during the c onduct of the clinical trial, perform SDV to 
confirm the accuracy and completeness of CRFs by [CONTACT_714932] (as specified below) 
data recorded in the CRF against data recorded  in source documents to ensure such records 
are consistent.  
To enable SDV , it is essential that what constitutes source data/documents (see definition 
above) for the clinical trial data to be collected  in the CRF as well as where such data can be 
found at the trial site is establ ished and agreed with the inves tigator at each trial site and 
documented prior to initiation of the clinical trial.  
Source data cannot be entered dire ctly into the CRF. Source data should as a general rule be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record or ot her defined document norma lly used at the trial 
site. Source data may be entered on a worksheet on ly if the clinical trial requires capture of 
data, which are normally not part of the subject’s medical record. 
For this clinical trial,  the following parameters collected in  the CRF should be verifiable from 
source documents available at the trial site: 
 Date of trial visits and date leaving the clinical trial 
 Relevant medical hi story and diagnosis  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 79 of 123
  
  Nature of contraception used  by [CONTACT_714933](s), when

 Data for evaluation of eligibility criteria 
 Dispensation/administration of investigational product 
 Concomitant medication (incl uding changes) and diagnoses 
 Subject demographics (sex, date of birth) 
 Adverse events, (nature, dates) 
In addition to the above, the following should be added to the subject’ s medical record in 
chronological order, i.e. when th ese are allocated to the subject: 
 Date(s) of conducting the informed consent pro cess including date of  provision of subject 
information 
 Date of enrolment 
 CRF book number 
 The fact that the subject is part icipating in a clinical trial in psoriasis with a treatment arm 
of calcipotriol 50 mcg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g gel for up to [ADDRESS_973862]’s medical record.

10.[ADDRESS_973863] Qualification for Analysis 
All subjects enrolled into the trial (i.e., si gned informed consent obtained and a CRF number 
assigned) will be accounted for in the clinical study report. 
 
All subjects who apply any IP will be include d in the full analysis set and analysed for 
efficacy. Exclusion from the full analysis set wi ll be carefully consid ered for subjects who 
apply no IP or who provide no efficacy data following start of treatment. 
 All subjects who apply any IP and for whom th e presence or confirmed absence of adverse 
events is available will be included in the safety analysis set and analysed for safety, except 
the analysis of the results from the ACTH-challenge test. 
 
For the analysis of the results from the ACTH-challenge test a per protocol analysis set will be 
defined by [CONTACT_714934], 
however excluding the subjects who do not: 
 apply any IP   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 81 of 123
  
  meet the inclusion criterion concerning evidence of adrenal function at baseline 
 provide any results for the ACTH-c hallenge test after receiving IP 
 
The decisions regarding inclusion/exclusion of subjects and/or subject data from the trial 
analysis sets will be documented in the clinical study report. 
10.11.2  Reasons for Leaving the Trial 
The reasons for leaving the trial will be presen ted separately for subjects who apply any IP 
and for enrolled subjects not assigned to treatment. 
10.11.3  Baseline Characteristics 
Descriptive statistics of demographics and othe r baseline characteristics will be presented for 
all subjects in the safety analysis set and per protocol analysis set as these are the datasets 
used for primary response criteria. 
 
Demographics include age, sex, ethnicity, race  and skin type. Other baseline characteristics 
include duration of psoriasis vulgaris, physical examination, i nvestigator’s global assessment 
of disease severity on body , PASI (calculated from the investigator’s assessment of extent and 
severity of the clinical signs) , investigator’s  assessment of extent of psoriasis (BSA and 
scalp) , patient’s global assessment of diseas e severity on body, concomitant medication and 
concurrent diagnoses. 
 
Age and sex will also be presented by [CONTACT_82064]. 
10.11.4  Compliance 
Compliance with treatment instructions will be  tabulated for all subjects who apply any IP. 
The number and percentage of subjects who comply and who do not comply with the trial 
treatment regimen will be summarised. The ex tent of non-compliance as categories of the 
percentage of applications missed (e.g. ≤  10%, > 10 to 20%, etc.) wi ll also be presented.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973865]. The tabulations described below 
will only include the events that are emergent with the trial treatment. 
 
The number of subjects experiencing each type of adverse event (according to MedDRA 
Preferred Terms within Primary System Organ Cl ass) will be tabulated regardless of the 
number of times each adverse event is reported by [CONTACT_6992].   
An overview summary of the number of subjec ts with any adverse events, adverse drug 
reactions, lesional/perilesional adverse events, serious advers e events and adverse events 
leading to withdrawal from the trial will be produced.  
The causal relationship to IP for each type of adverse event (according to the Preferred Term) 
will be tabulated. Where there are several record ings of causal relationship to IP for a given 
type of adverse event, causal relationship will be taken as the most-related recording from the 
last report of that adverse event, since that is  when the investigator will be in possession of 
most information and so best able  to judge causal relationship.  
 The intensity for each type of adverse even t (according to the Preferred Term) will be 
presented. Where there are several recordings of  intensity for a given type of adverse event 
the most severe intensity will be selected.  
 
Adverse drug reactions are defined as advers e events for which the investigator has not 
described the causal relationship to IP as “not related”. The number of subjects experiencing 
each type of adverse drug reaction (according to the Preferred Term) will be tabulated. The 
intensity for each type of adverse drug reaction will be presented.   
The number of subjects experiencing each type of lesional/perilesional adverse event, 
lesional/perilesional adverse event on the body and lesional/perilesional adverse event on the 
scalp (according to the Preferred Term) will be tabulated.   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 83 of 123

10.12  Trial Committees 
LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel has obtained marketing authorisa tion in 2008 and has been marketed in the 
U.S., several European countries and more th an 40 other countries worldwide, including 
Canada and Australia. The clinical trial programme for LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel has so far included 
more than 6000 psoriasis patients, of whom  more than 3000 were treated with LEO [ZIP_CODE] 
gel. LEO [ZIP_CODE] gel has since launch in 2008 to  December 2012, been prescribed for 
approximately 4.8 million treatment courses.  
Two non-controlled trials, MBL 0801 and MBL 0412 INT, in adolescent subjects (aged 12-
17 years) with psoriasis on the scalp have recently been completed. In a total of 
109 adolescent subjects using up to 69 g/week , LEO gel was safe and effective in the 
treatment of psoriasis vulgari s on the scalp.  The effects on calcium metabolism were 
investigated; no cases of hypercalcaemia and no clin ically relevant changes in urinary calcium 
were reported. The adrenal response to ACTH  challenge was assessed in a subset of 30 
patients; one patient showed a decrease in cort isol response to ACTH challenge after 4 weeks 
of treatment which was considered mild ( 7) (8).  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 87 of 123
  
 In this trial, patients 12-14 years with a BSA of ≤ 1.3 m2 will receive up to 50 g/week.  
Patients 12-14 years with a BSA > 1.3 m2  and patients 15-16 years, 11 months with a BSA ≤ 
1.7 m2 will receive up to 75 g/week.  Patients 15- 16 years, 11 months with a BSA > 1.7 m2 
will receive up to 100 g/week.  The maximum approved dose in adults is 100g/week. 
The use of CORTROSYN® in this trial will be entirely in  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_714887] U.S. Prescribing Information, therefore its use in this trial is also 
not expected to reveal any new safety findings. 
It is hence not considered necessary to have a Data Monitoring Committee for this trial. 
10.13  Quality Assurance/Audit 
LEO Pharma A/S has implemented a system of quality assurance, including all elements 
described in this protocol. Within this sy stem company Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) are implemented to ensu re that clinical trials are conducted in compliance with 
regulatory requirements and Good C linical Practice (GCP). Qualit y control is applied to each 
stage of data handling to ensure that data are accurate, reliable and processed correctly. 
Trial sites, facilities, laboratories and all da ta (including sources) and documentation must be 
available for GCP audit by [CONTACT_82102] A/S or inspection by [CONTACT_65996]. Any aspect of the clinical tria l may be subject to audit by [CONTACT_82102] A/S and/or inspection 
by [CONTACT_12721] (national or foreign) or IEC/IRB. Such audits/inspections may take 
place at the sponsor’s site(s) or at any trial site including laboratories, pharmacies etc. 
The monitor will, in case of audit, announce this  in advance to the (sub)investigator and be 
present at the particular trial site during the audit. 
The site staff should assist in all aspects of audit/inspection. 
10.13.1  Trial Monitoring 
LEO Pharma A/S, as sponsor of this clinical tr ial, is responsible to the regulatory authorities 
for assuring the proper conduct of the clinical trial with regard  to protocol adherence and 
validity of the data recorded in the CRFs. The company has therefore assigned persons to 
monitor this trial. Their duties are to serve as  the principal link between (sub)investigators and  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 88 of 123
  
 LEO Pharma A/S and advise the investigator on the collection and maintenance of accurate, 
complete, legible, well organised and easily retrievable data for the clinical trial. In addition, 
they will explain to the investig ators any aspect of the (conduct of  the) clinical trial, including 
interpretation of the protocol , the purpose of colle cting the specified data and reporting 
responsibilities. 
In order to perform their role effectively, m onitors and persons involved in quality assurance 
and inspections (see above) will need direct access  to primary subject data, e.g. medical 
records, laboratory reports, appointment books etc. Because this aff ects the subject’s confi-
dentiality, this fact is included on the Subject  Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form. 
This clinical trial is organised by [CONTACT_82102]  A/S and all enquiries should be made to a 
member of LEO Pharma A/S staff (see section [ 6.3], LEO Pharma A/S Personnel).  
10.14  Case Report Form Books and Data Handling 
10.14.1  Case Report Forms (CRFs) 
In this clinical trial data will be collected  by [CONTACT_714942] (RDC). The 
investigator or staff authorised by [CONTACT_714943] A/S. A uniquely numbe red CRF book will be used for each subject 
enrolled. Data recorded in the electronic CRFs will be accessible to site staff through a secure 
internet connection immediately after entry. The CRFs must be maintained in an up-to-date 
condition at all times by [CONTACT_093].  
The investigator, or sub-inves tigator(s) authorised by [CONTACT_093], will electronically sign 
all sections of CRFs used. This signature [CONTACT_3031] (incl. date of signature) will be kept in 
the audit trail and cannot be altered. Only me dically qualified (sub)inve stigators can sign data 
on clinical assessments/safety. A ny correction(s) made by [CONTACT_714944]. Changes to data 
already approved, requires the re-s ignature of the investigator or  authorised staff. The person 
making the change and the date, time and reason for the change will be identified in the audit trail.  
The trial monitor will check the CRFs for accur acy and completeness and perform source data 
verification preferably no late r than eight weeks after each subject visit. For archiving 
purposes each investigator will be supplied with a copy of the CRFs, for all subjects enrolled  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 89 of 123
  
 at the trial site, via an electronic medium at completion of the trial. Audit trail information 
will be included. CRFs will be available for in spection by [CONTACT_714945] A/S (e.g. audit by [CONTACT_714946]), from regulatory authorities 
and/or IEC/IRBs. 
10.14.[ADDRESS_973869] data should be entered in to the electronic CRF in a ti mely manner by [CONTACT_714947]. Data will be entered by [CONTACT_714948]. Queries for 
discrepant data may be generated automati cally by [CONTACT_714949]. All queries, whether generated by [CONTACT_121622] a user, will be in an electronic form at. This systematic validation will ensure that 
a clean and consistent database is provided prior to the statisti cal analysis being performed.  
10.15  Protocol Amendments 
Neither the investigator(s) nor LEO Pharma A/S will change the Clinical Study Protocol 
without written agreement between LEO Pharma A/S and the international co-ordinating 
investigator. Any modification considered substantial requires approva l/favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_714888]/IRB. 
Protocol amendments are issued as Consolid ated Clinical Study Protocols comprising all 
current amendments. Consolidated Clinical Study Protocols become effective when written 
approval has been provided by [CONTACT_714950]-ordinating investigator, the head of 
Medical Department and the head of Biostatis tics and Data Management, LEO Pharma A/S, 
and approval/favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_714889]/or IEC/IRB has been obtained, as required. 
Alternatively, a protocol addendum may be issu ed to comply with national/regional specific 
requirements. A protocol addendum becomes effective when written approval has been 
provided by [CONTACT_714950]-o rdinating investigator, the head  of Medical Department and 
the head of Biostatistics and Data Ma nagement, LEO Pharma A/S, and the and

in each participating country and overall (all countries).  
Investigators will be informed when subject recruitment is to cease. 
Trial enrolment will be stopped at a trial site when the total requested number of subjects for 
the clinical trial has been obt ained, irrespective of the specific site’s planned inclusion 
number. 
Upon completion of the clinical  trial, LEO Pharma A/S will undertake arrangements for 
collection and disposal of any unused trial materi al that the investigator  is not required to 
keep in his/her files. 
LEO Pharma A/S may stop the clinical trial pr ematurely after consultation with the interna-
tional co-ordinating investigator, e.g. if the subjec t recruitment is so slow that the clinical trial 
cannot be completed within a reasonable time frame. Such premature termination/suspension 
of the trial will be notified to regulator y authorities and IECs/IRBs, as required. 
10.16.[ADDRESS_973871] Care Following Trial Completion 
After the completion of the trial, the subjects wi ll be treated at the inve stigator’s discretion or 
referred to other physician(s) a ccording to sta ndard practice. 
10.16.[ADDRESS_973872] make arrangements to store th e essential trial docu-
ments, (as defined in Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (ICH E6, 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice)) including the Investigator Trial File, until LEO Pharma 
A/S informs the investigator that the documents are no longer to be retained. 
In addition, the investigator is  responsible for the archiving of  all relevant source documents 
so that the trial data can be compared against source data after completion of the trial (e.g. in 
case of inspection from regulatory authorities). 
The investigator is required to ensure the c ontinued storage of the documents, even if the 
investigator, for example, leaves the clinic/pract ice or retires before the end of the required 
storage period. 
At present according to ICH Guideline:  

LP0076-[ADDRESS_973873]. These documents 
should be retained for a longer period however  if required by [CONTACT_165032]. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to 
inform the investiga-tor/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be 
retained . (ICH E6, 4.9.5)

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
 Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, He lsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by 
[CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_973884] , Republic of South Africa, October 1996 
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000  53th WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (N ote of Clarification on paragraph 29 
added) 55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added) 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008 A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has deve loped the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, 
including research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should not be applied without considerat ion of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Although the Declaration is a ddressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages 
other participants in medical  research involving human subj ects to adopt these princi-
ples. 
3. It is the duty of the physicia n to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including 
those who are involved in medical resear ch. The physician's knowledge and conscience 
are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  

Declaration of Helsinki last amended Seoul 2008 Appendix II, Page 106 of 123
  
 4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA bi nds the physician with the words, "The 
health of my patient will be my first c onsideration," and the In ternational Code of 
Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician sh all act in the patient's best interest when 
providing medical care." 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be 
provided appropriate access to participation in research. 
6. In medical research involving human subjects , the well-being of the individual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests. 
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is  to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseas es and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments ). Even the best current 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effective-
ness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. 
8. In medical practice and in medical research , most interventions involve risks and bur-
dens. 
9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human 
subjects and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly 
vulnerable and need special protection. Thes e include those who cannot give or refuse 
consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influ-
ence. 
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, le gal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as  applicable interna-
tional norms and standards. No national or in ternational ethical, legal or regulatory re-
quirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for re search subjects set 
forth in this Declaration. 
 
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
11. It is the duty of phys icians who participate in medical research to protect the life, 
health, dignity, integrity, right to self-deter mination, privacy, and c onfidentiality of per-
sonal information of research subjects.  

Declaration of Helsinki last amended Seoul [ADDRESS_973885], incentives for 
subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a 
consequence of participation in the resear ch study. The protocol should describe ar-
rangements for post-study access by [CONTACT_62444] s to interventions identified as bene-
ficial in the study or access to ot her appropriate care or benefits. 
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to a research ethics committee be fore the study begins. This committee must 
be independent of the resear cher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must 
take into consideration the la ws and regulations of the country or countries in which 
the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards 
but these must not be allowed to reduce or e liminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration. Th e committee must have the right to monitor on-
going studies. The researcher must provide  monitoring information to the committee, 
especially information about any serious a dverse events. No change to the protocol 
may be made without consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942]. 
16. Medical research involving human subject s must be conducted only by [CONTACT_678029]. Research on patients or 
healthy volunteers requ ires the supervision of a compet ent and appropriately qualified 
physician or other health care professional.  The responsibility for the protection of 
research subjects must always rest with th e physician or other health care professional 
and never the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 
17. Medical research involving a di sadvantaged or vulnerable population or community is 
only justified if the research is responsive to  the health needs and priorities of this pop-
ulation or community and if there is a reasonab le likelihood that th is population or 
community stands to benefit from the results of the research.  

Declaration of Helsinki last amended Seoul [ADDRESS_973886]'s 
freely-given in-formed consent, preferably  in writing. If the consent cannot be 
expressed in writing, the non-written cons ent must be formally documented and 
witnessed.  

Declaration of Helsinki last amended Seoul [ADDRESS_973887] nor-
mally seek consent for the collection, analysis , storage and/or reuse. There may be situ-
ations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or 
would pose a threat to the validity of the res earch. In such situations the research may 
be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee. 
26. When seeking informed consent for partic ipation in a research study the physician 
should be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under dures s. In such situations the informed con-
sent should be sought by [CONTACT_714965]-
pendent of this relationship. 
27. For a potential research subj ect who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed 
consent from the legally authorized represen tative. These individua ls must not be in-
cluded in a research study th at has no likelihood of benef it for them unless it is intend-
ed to promote the health of the population represented by [CONTACT_11275], the re-
search cannot instead be perf ormed with competent persons, and the research entails 
only minimal risk and minimal burden. 
28. When a potential research subject who is deemed  incompetent is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in 
addition to the consent of the legally author ized representative. The potential subject's 
dissent should be respected. 
29. Research involving subjects who are physica lly or mentally incapable of giving

 CORTROSYN®™ 
FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY  
(cosyntropin) for Injection  
 
DESCRIPTION  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for In jection is a sterile lyophilized  powder in vials containing 
0.25 mg of CORTROSYN™ and 10 mg of mannitol to be recons tituted with 1 mL of 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  Administration is by [CONTACT_121634].  
Cosyntropin is α [ADDRESS_973890] 24 of the 39 amino acids of natural 
ACTH. The sequence of amino acids in  the 1 - 24 compound is as follows:  
 
Ser - Tyr - Ser - Met - Glu - His - Phe - Arg - Trp - Gly - Lys - Pro - Val - Gly - Lys - Lys - Arg - Arg - Pro - Val - Lys - V al - Tyr - Pro

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection exhib its the full cortico-steroidogenic activity of 
natural ACTH. Various studies have shown that the biologic activity of ACTH resides in the 
N-terminal portion of the molecule and that the 1 - 20 amino acid residue is the minimal 
sequence retaining full activity. Partial or complete  loss of activity is noted with progressive 
shortening of the chain beyond 20 amino acid residues. For example, the decrement from 20 
to 19 results in a 70% loss of potency.  
 
The pharmacologic profile of CORTROSYN™ is si milar to that of purified natural ACTH. It 
has been established that 0.25 mg of CORTROSYN™ will stimulate the adrenal cortex 
maximally and to the same extent as 25 units  of natural ACTH. This dose of CORTROSYN™ 
will produce maximal secretion of 17-OH corticosteroids, 17- ketosteroids and / or 17 - ketogenic steroids.  
 The extra-adrenal effects which natural ACTH  and CORTROSYN™ have in common include 
increased melanotropic activity, increased grow th hormone secretion and an adipokinetic 
effect. These are considered to be without  physiological or clin ical significance.

 Animal, human and synthetic ACTH (1-39) which all contain [ADDRESS_973891] very little im munologic although full 
biologic activity. This property of CORTROSYN™ assumes added importance in view of the known antigenicity of natural ACTH.

 INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection is intended for use as a diagnostic agent in the 
screening of patients presumed to have adrenoc ortical insufficiency. Because of its rapid 
effect on the adrenal cortex it may be utilized to perform a 30-minute test of adrenal function 
(plasma cortisol response) as an office or out patient procedure, using only 2 venipunctures 
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section).  
 
Severe hypofunction of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_491339] - adrenal axis is usua lly associated with subnormal 
plasma cortisol values but a low basal level is not per se evidence of ad renal insufficiency and 
does not suffice to make the diagnosis. Many patients with proven insufficiency will have 
normal basal levels and will develop signs of insufficiency only when stressed. For this reason 
a criterion which should be used in establishing the diagnosis is the failure to respond to 
adequate corticotropin stimulation. When pres umptive adrenal insuffic iency is diagnosed by a 
subnormal CORTROSYN™ test, further studies are indicated to determine if it is primary or 
secondary.  
 
Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addi son’s disease) is the result of an intrinsic disease process, 
such as tuberculosis within the gland. The production of adrenocortical hormones is deficient 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_714901] (feedback mechanism). Secondary or relative insufficiency arises 
as the result of defective produc tion of ACTH leading in turn to  disuse atrophy of the adrenal 
cortex. It is commonly seen, for example, as result of corticosteroid therapy, Sheehan’s syndrome and pi[INVESTIGATOR_121525].  
 
The differentiation of both types is based on th e premise that a primarily defective gland 
cannot be stimulated by [CONTACT_714966] a secondarily defective gl and is potentially functional 
and will respond to adequate stimulation with AC TH. Patients selected for further study as the 
result of a subnormal CORTROSYN™ test should be given a 3 or 4 day course of treatment 
with Repository Corticotropin Injection USP and then retested. Suggested doses are 40 USP units twice daily for 4 days or 60 USP units tw ice daily for 3 days. U nder these conditions 
little or no increase in plasma cortisol levels will be seen in Addison’s disease whereas higher or even normal levels will be seen in cases  with secondary adrenal insufficiency.  
 
CONTRAINDICATION  
The only contraindication to CO RTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for In jec-tion is a history of a 
previous adverse reaction to it.

 PRECAUTIONS  
General  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection exhi bits slight immunologic activity, does not 
contain animal protein and is th erefore less risky to use than  natural ACTH. Patients known to 
be sensitized to natural ACTH with markedly positive skin tests will, with few exceptions, re-
act negatively when tested intradermally with CORTROSYN™. Most patients with a history 
of a previous hypersensitivity react ion to natural ACTH or a pre- existing allergic disease will 
tolerate CORTROSYN™. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_121526], CORTROSYN™ is not completely devoid of immunologic activity and hypersensitivity reactions including rare anaphylaxis are 
possible. Therefore, the physician should be pre-pared, prior to in jection, to treat any possible 
acute hypersensitivity reaction.   
Drug Interactions  
Corticotropin may accentuate the electrolyte lo ss associated with diuretic therapy.  
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
Long term studies in animals have not been pe rformed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic 
potential or impairment of fertility. A study in  rats noted inhibition of reproductive function 
like natural ACTH.  
 
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection. It  is also not known whether CORTROSYN™ 
can cause fetal harm when ad-ministered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction 
capacity. CORTROSYN™ should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.  
 
Nursing Mothers  
It is not known whether this drug is excr eted in human milk. Because many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, caution should be ex ercised when CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for 
Injection is administered  to a nursing woman.

 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Since CORTROSYN®™ (cosyntropin) for Inje ction is intended fo r diagnostic and not 
therapeutic use, adverse reactions other th an a rare hypersensitiv ity reaction are not 
anticipated. A rare hypersensitivi ty reaction usually associated with a pre-existing allergic 
disease and/or a previous reacti on to natural ACTH is possible. Symptoms may include slight 
whealing with splotchy erythema at the injec tion site. There have been rare reports of 
anaphylactic reaction. The following adverse reactions have been re ported in patients after the 
administration of CORTROSYN®™ and the asso ciation has been neither confirmed nor 
refuted:  
o bradycardia  
o tachycardia  
o hypertension  
o peripheral edema  
o rash  
 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection may be administered intramuscularly or as a 
direct intravenous injection when used as a ra pid screening test of ad renal function. It may 
also be given as an intravenous infusion ove r a 4 to 8 hour period to provide a greater 
stimulus to the adrenal glands. Doses of CORT ROSYN™ 0.[ADDRESS_973892] of  adrenal function has been described by [CONTACT_714967] (1). A control blood sample of 6 to 7 ml is collected in a heparinized tube. 
Reconstitute 0.25 mg of CORTRO SYN™ with 1mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 
and inject intramuscularly. The reconstituted dr ug product should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to  injection. Reconstituted CORTROSYN™ should 
not be retained. In the pediatric population, aged  2 years or less, a dos e of 0.125 mg will often 
suffice. A second blood sample is collected exactly 30 minutes later. Both blood samples 
should be refrigerated until sent to the laboratory for determination of the plasma cortisol 
response by [CONTACT_714968]. If it is no t possible to send them to the laboratory or 
perform the fluorimetric procedure within 12 hou rs, then the plasma should be separated and 
refrigerated or frozen according to need.  
 
Two alternative methods of administration are intravenous inje ction and infusion. 
CORTROSYN™ can be injected in travenously in 2 to 5 mL of saline over a 2-minute period. 
When given as an intravenous infusion: CORT ROSYN™, 0.25 mg may be added to glucose  

US Prescribing Information for CORTROSYN® (cosyntronin) for 
injection  Appendix III, Page [ADDRESS_973893] day and 
patients taking spi[INVESTIGATOR_714902].  
 
A paradoxical response may be noted in the co rtisone or hydrocortisone group as seen in a 
decrease in plasma cortisol values follo wing a stimulating dose  of CORTROSYN™.  
In the spi[INVESTIGATOR_121528] a normal incremen tal response is to be expected. 
Many patients with normal adrenal function, however, do not respond to the expected degree 
so that the following criteria have been established to denote a normal response:  
 
1.    The control plasma cortisol level should exceed 5 micrograms/[ADDRESS_973894] 7 micrograms/100 ml above the 
basal level.  
3. The 30-minute level should exceed 18 micrograms/[ADDRESS_973895] 
been reported by [CONTACT_121638]-workers 
 Plasma cortisol levels usually peak about 45 to 60 minutes after an injection of CORTROSYN™ and some prefer the 60-minute interv al for testing for this reason. While it is 
true that the 60-minute values are usually hi gher than the 30-minute values, the difference 
may not be significant enough in most cases to outweigh the disadvantage of a longer testing 
period. If the 60-minute test period is used, the criterion for a normal response is an 
approximate doubling of the basal plasma cortisol value.  
 
In patients with a raised plasma bilirubin or  in patients where the plasma contains free 
hemoglobin, falsely high fluorescence measurements  will result. The test may be performed at 
any time during the day but because of the physiol ogical diurnal variation of plasma cortisol 
the criteria listed by [CONTACT_714969]. It has been shown that basal plasma cortisol levels  

US Prescribing Information for CORTROSYN® (cosyntronin) for 
injection  Appendix III, Page [ADDRESS_973896] CORTROSYN™ increment exhibit diurnal changes. However, the 30-minute 
plasma cortisol level remains unchanged throughout the day so that only this single criterion 
should be used (3).  
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration 
whenever solution and container permit. Reconstituted CORTROSYN™ should not be 
retained.

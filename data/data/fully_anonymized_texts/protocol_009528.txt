1.1 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
Name  [CONTACT_40149]:    MEDI4736  
Title of Study :  Phase  II Study  to Evaluate  the Efficacy  of MEDI4736  in Immunological  Subsets  of Advanced  
Colorectal  Cancer  
Study  Centers:  MSKCC  
Study  Period:  24 months  Phase  of Development:  II 
Objectives:  
The primary  objective  of this study  is to determine  the objective  response rate of MEDI4736  in subjects  with 
DNA mismatch  repair  deficient  (dMMR)  or Tumor  Infiltrating  Lymphocyte -positive  (TIL+)  advanced/metastatic  
Colorectal  Cancer  (CRC),  according  to RECIST  1.1. 
The secondary  objectives  are to determine : 
• The objecti  ve response  rate according  to immune -related  RECIST  (irRECIST)  of MEDI4736  in dMMR  
or TIL+ CRC  
• Progression -free survi val of MEDI  4736  in dMMR  or TIL+ advanced/metastatic  CRC  
• Overall survival  of MEDI4736  in dMMR  or TIL+ advanced/metastatic  CRC  
• Safety  and tolerability  of MEDI4736  in subjects  with CRC  
The exploratory  objective  of this study  is to eval uate biomarkers  that may correlate  with acti vity of MEDI4736  
in CRC,  or prospecti  vely identify  CRC  patients  likely  to respond  to MEDI4736  treatment.  
Study  De sign:  This will be a Simon  two-stage  design,  single  arm, phase  II study.  It will be conducted  to 
determine  the efficacy  and safety  of MEDI4736  in subjects  with CRC.  Subjects  will be stratified  to ensure  that 
we include  CRC  tumor -types  that are considered  to be immunogenic  and therefore  more  likely  to be effecti  vely 
targeted by [CONTACT_40099]. These  include  patients  with DNA  mismatch  repair  proficient  
tumors  that are characterized  by [CONTACT_40100],  as well as subjects  with hereditary  (Lynch  
syndrome)  or acquired  dMMR.  
 
All subjects  will recei  ve MEDI4736  vi a IV infusion  at 10 mg/kg  every  two weeks  (Q2W).  Subjects  will continue  
treatment  Q2W  for 12 months,  or until progression  of disease,  initiation  of alternative  cancer  therapy,  
unacceptable toxicity,  or other  reasons  to discontinue  treatment  occur.  Following  the 12-month  treatment  
period,  subjects  without  evi dence  for progressi  ve disease  or other  reason  to discontinue  treatment  will be 
monitored  without  further  treatment.  Upon  evidence  of PD during  the monitoring  period,  administration  of 
MEDI4736  may resume  at the Q2W  schedule,  for up to another  12 months.  Treatment  of isolated,  non-target,  
lesions  for palliati  ve/therapeutic intent  is acceptable  after discussion  with the Principal  Investigator  (e.g. by 
[CONTACT_40101],  surgery  or radiation).  Tumor  measurements  and determination  of tumor  responses  for this study  will 
be performed  according  to RECIST  1. 1. Subjects  may continue  to receive  MEDI4736  beyond  radiographic  
progression  in the absence  of clinical  deterioration,  and after discussion  with the Principal  Investigator.  All 
subjects  will be followed  up to [ADDRESS_41859] response  rate in dMMR  CRC  (cohort  1) and TIL+ CRC  (cohort  2) 
patients.  A two-stage  Simon‟s  optimal  design  will be employed  to test the null hypothesis  that the true 
response  rate is ≤5% vers us the alternative  hypothesis  that the true response  rate is at least  25% with type I 
and II error  rates  of 10% each.  Each  cohort  will be evaluated  separately  fo r this purpose.   In the fi rst stage,  we 
will accrue  9 patients  in each  cohort.  If 0 objective  tumor  responses  (PR or CR) are observed  among  the [ADDRESS_41860]  1 respo  nse is 
observed  among  the 9 subjects  treated  in a cohort,  then the study  will be expanded  to enroll  a total of 24 
treated  subjects  in that cohort.  At the end of the study,  if 2 or fewer  objecti  ve tumor  responses  are observed  in 
a cohort,  then the study  will be considered  not worthy  of further  investigation  in that particular  cohort.  If at the 
end of the study  ≥[ADDRESS_41861] stage  only.

total)  and second  most  common  in women,  with 571,000  cases  (9.4%  of the total)  per year.  Each  
year there  are about  608,000  deaths  from colon  cancer  which  is approximately  8% of all cancer  
deaths  making  colorectal  cancer  the fourth  most  common  cause  of canc er death1.  In [ADDRESS_41869]  commonly  rated  according  to tumor,  
nodes,  and metastasis  (TNM)  criteria.   The initial  treatment  is surgery.  However,  post-surgery  
metastatic  disease  occurs  in 40%-60% of patients  and the prognosis  for patients  who develop  
advanced  metastatic  disease  is poor.  Over  the past decade,  progress  has been  made  in the role of 
systemic  therapy  for the palliation  of advanced  colorectal  cancer.  With the introduction  of oxaliplatin,  
irinotecan,  anti-VEGF  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  and anti-EGFR  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  the median  life expectancy  of patients  
has been  increased  to about  20 months3. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_40075],  patients  with 
unresectable,  metastatic  and/or  recurrent  CRC,  remain  incurable.  There  is a substantial  unmet  
medical  need  for more  effective  and less toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  especially  for those  patients  with advanced  
disease  that have not responded  or have  become  resistant  to the existing  standard  treatments.  The 
development  of novel  approaches  to treatment  is greatly  needed  in order  to improve  outcomes  in 
such  patients.

can result  in complete  clearance  of tumor  cells as is seen  in rare cases  of spontaneous  regression

progressed  to the escape  phase  during  immunoediting.  Programmed  death  ligand  1 (PD-L1) (B7-  
H1, CD274)  is part of a complex  system  of receptors  and ligands  that are involved  in controlling  T- 
cell activation.  In normal  tissue,  PD-L1 is expressed  on T cells,  B cells,  dendritic  cells,  macrophages,  
mesenchymal  stem cells,  bone  marrow -derived  mast  cells,  as well as various  nonhematopoietic  
cells 6. Its normal  function  is to regulate  the balance  between  T-cell activation  and tolerance  through  
interaction  with its two receptors  programmed  death  1 (PD-1, CD279)  and CD80  (B7-1). PD-L1 is 
also expressed  by [CONTACT_40104].  In the lymph  nodes,  PD-L1 on antigen  presenting  cells (APC)  binding  to 
PD-1 (CD279)  or CD80  (B7-1) on activated  T cells delivers  an inhibitory  signal  to the T cell 6. 
Likewise,  binding  of CD80  on APCs  to PD-L1 on T cells leads  to inhibitory  signaling  in the T cell. 
These  and bidirectional  interactions between  CD80  and PD-L1, expressed  on both APCs  and T 
cells,  lead to further  inhibition  of T-cell activation.  These  interactions  result  in reduced  T-cell 
activation  and fewer  activated  T cells in the circulation.  In the tumor  microenvironment,  PD-L1 
expressed  on tumor  cells binds  to PD-[ADDRESS_41872]  range  of cancers  with a high frequency,  up to 88% in some  types  of 
cancer.  In a number  of these  cancers,  including  lung8, renal9- 11, pancreatic12-14, ovarian15, and 
colorectal  cancer16, the expression  of PD-L1 is associated  with reduced  survival  and unfavorable  
prognosis.  In ovarian  cancer,  for example,  the 5-year survival  rate in patients  with low levels  of PD- 
L1 was 80.2%,  compared  to 52.6%  in patients  with high levels  of PD-L115. In lung cancer,  only 20% 
of patients  with tumors  expressing  PD-L1 survived  for more  than 3 years,  compared  to 49% of 
patients  with tumors  lacking  PD-L18. 
Based  on these  data,  and on assessments  of expression  of PD-L1 on the surface  of human  tumors  
using  proprietary  immunohistochemistry  methods  for assessment,  MEDI4736  has the potential  to 
affect  multiple  types  of solid tumors,  including  CRC.  
 
Blocking  PD-L1 is a similar  approach  to that taken  by [CONTACT_40105][INVESTIGATOR_125]  (anti-CTLA -4), but has some  
potential  advantages.  Firstly,  the expression  of CTLA -4 and its ligands  is restricted  to the 
hematopoietic  system;  thus the site of action  for molecules  targeting  CTLA -[ADDRESS_41873] additional  effects  within  the 
tumor  microenvironment.  Secondly  CTLA -4 plays  an early  and critical  role in controlling  T-cell 
activation.  This is reflected  in the phenotype  of CTLA -4 knockout  mice,  which  die at an age of

prognosis  in CRC25, suggesting  that an antitumor  immune  response  is beneficial  to patients.  It has 
been  shown  in vitro that an antibody  that blocks  the interaction  between  PD-L1 and its receptors  can 
relieve  PD-L1-dependent  immunosuppressive  effects  and enhance  the cytotoxic  activity  of antitumor  
T cells26. Based  on these  findings,  an anti-PD-L1 antibody  could  be used  therapeutically  to enhance  
the antitumor  immune  responses  in patients  with CRC  characterized  by [CONTACT_40106].  
3.3.2  DNA MISMATCH REPAIR DEFICIENCY 
 
dMMR  CRC  display  increased  rates  of intragenic  mutations  of short,  tandemly  repeated  DNA  
sequences  known  as microsatellites.  These  tumors  are characterized  by [CONTACT_40107],  mutational  
and/or  epi[INVESTIGATOR_40076]  (MMR)  genes.  The primary  function  of the MMR  
system  is to eliminate  base -base  mismatches  and insertion/deletion  loops  that arise  as a 
consequence  of DNA polymerase  slippage  during  DNA  synthesis.  As a result  mutation  rates  in 
tumors  characterized  by [CONTACT_40108] 100- to 1,000 -fold more  common  as compared  to 
normal  tissues.  
MMR  deficiency  is characteristic  of the hereditary  non-polyposis  colorectal  cancer  (HNPCC)  
syndrome.  HNPCC  is an autosomal -dominant  condition  that accounts  for approximately  2–3% of all 
CRC.  In most  cases,  the inherited  germline  alteration  is identified  in one of the five human  MMR  
gene s: MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, and PMS1. 
 
MMR  deficiency  can also occur  in 10–15% of sporadic  non-HNPCC  colorectal  cancers.  In these  
patients,  the basis  for instability  is usually  an acquired  hypermethylation  of the MLH1  promoter  with 
subsequent  transcriptional  silencing.  MMR  deficient  sporadic  colorectal  tumors  frequently  
accumulate  mutations  at microsatellite  sequences  in coding  regions  of specific  genes  that are 
implicated  in tumor  progression,  such  as TGFβRI I, IGFIIR,  MSH3,  MSH6,  and BAX.  
Clinically,  MMR  deficient  CRC  is characterized  by a better  prognosis  and a lower  frequency  of 
distant  metastases  as compared  to conventional  CRCs.  A dense  infiltration  with lymphocytes  is a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_40077],  suggesting  recognition  by [CONTACT_40109].  
 
This ability  of the immune  system  to recognize  MMR  deficient  CRCs  is attributed  to the multiple  
frameshift  peptides  (FSPs)  that are generated  as a direct  consequence  of MMR  deficiency  and

3.3 Description of MEDI4736  
 
MEDI4736 is briefly described below. Refer to the current Investigator‟s Brochure for details. 
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_41875]  Derivation  
 
MEDI4736 is a human immunog lobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed 
against human PD-L1. MEDI4736 has an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa, 
including  N-linked  oligosaccharides.  The antibody  is composed  of 2 identical  heavy  chains  of 
approximately  49,670  Da each,  and 2 identical  light chains  of approximately  23,390  Da each.  The 
fragment  crystallizable  (Fc) domain  of MEDI4736  contains  a triple  mutation  in the constant  domain  
of the IgG1 heavy  chain  that reduces  binding  to the complement  component  C1q and the Fcγ 
receptors  responsible  for mediating  antibody -dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)27. 
Subsequent  to this triple mutation,  the anticipated  lack of MEDI4736 -mediated  antibody -dependent  
cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  and complement -dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  were  confirmed  
using cell-based functional assays. MEDI4736 is selective for recombinant PD-L1 and blocks the 
binding  of recombinant  PD-L1 to the PD-1 and CD80  receptors.  
 
3.3.2  Summary  of Nonclinical  Experience  
 
MEDI4736 has shown the following activity as an anti-PD-L1 molecule: 
 
• MEDI4736 binds to PD-L1 and blocks its interaction with PD-1 and CD80 
• MEDI4736 can relieve  PD-L1-mediated  suppression  of human  T-cell activation  in vitro 
• MEDI4736 or tremelimumab (an anti-CTLA-4 antibody) or the combination does not 
result  in cytokine  release  when  assessed  in vitro in assays  using  whole  blood  from 
healthy  human  donors  
• MEDI4736 inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model via a T-cell dependen t mechanism 
• A surrogate  anti-mouse  PD-L1 antibody  resulted  in improved  survival  in a syngeneic  
tumor  model  as monotherapy  and resulted  in complete  tumor  regression  in > 50% of 
treated  mice  when  given  in combination  with chemotherapy  
• In the same  study,  anti-mouse  PD-L1 antibody -treated  mice  were  completely  tumor  free 
3 months  after tumor  implantation  and demonstrated  long-term immunity  during  re- 
challenge  
• In a subsequent  study  in the same  syngeneic  model,  the combination  of an anti-mouse  
PD-L1 antibody  and anti-CTLA -4 antibody  resulted  in complete  tumor  regression  in all 
mice  treated  
• Prevalence  of PD-L1 expression  on the surface  of human  tumors  ranging  from 
approximately  0-35%,  was demonstrated  in a broad  survey  of samples  derived  from 
tumor  types  of interest  
 
The cynomolgus  monkey  is considered  to be the only relevant  nonclinical  species  for evaluation  of 
local and systemic  toxicities  of MEDI4736.  This conclusion  was based  on the high identity  of amino  
acid sequence  of extracellular  domain  (ECD)  of cynomolgus  monkey  (cyno)PD -L1 and human  
(h)PD -L1 (95.9%  identity),  including  the conservation  of an amino  acid in cynoPD -L1 that was

identified  to be strongly  involved  in MEDI4736 binding  to hPD-L1, and the similar  binding  affinity  of 
MEDI4736 for cynoPD-L1 and hPD-L1. In addition, in vivo in cynomolgus monkeys, MEDI4736 
suppresses  soluble  (s)B7  H1 in serum  and fully occupi[INVESTIGATOR_40078]-L1 on various  leukocyte  
subsets  at doses  equal  to or more  than 0.1 mg/kg  (lowest  dose  tested)  with a dose -related  duration  
of suppression  and occupancy.  
In general, there were no MEDI4736-related adverse effects in toxicology studies condu cted in 
cynomolgus  monkeys  with MEDI4736  that were  of relevance  to humans.  Adverse  findings  in the 
non-Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  PK/PD  and dose  range -finding  study  (4 doses  over 5 weeks),  
and a GLP 4-week  repeat -dose  toxicity  study  were  consistent  with anti-drug antibody  (ADA) - 
associated  morbidity  and mortality  in individual  animals.  The death  of a single  animal  in the non- 
GLP,  PK/PD,  and dose  range -finding  study  was consistent  with an ADA-associated  acute  
anaphylactic  reaction  based  on the presence  of ADA within  days of the first dose,  acuteness  and 
timing  (after  repeated  dosing)  of the death,  clinical  signs  consistent  with an anaphylactic  reaction,  
lack of remarkable  effects  on other  study  parameters,  and lack of histopathologic  findings  consistent  
with any other  cause  of death.  In addition,  the spectrum  of findings,  especially  the microscopic  
pathology,  in a single  animal  in the GLP,  4-week,  repeat -dose  study  was also consistent  with ADA- 
mediated  effects;  similar  effects  have been  observed  by [CONTACT_40111] -complexes  were  identified  
in the affected  animal  in a subsequent  investigative  study.  Given  that immunogenicity  of human  
monoclonal  antibodies  in nonclinical  species  is not generally  predictive  of responses  in humans,  the 
ADA-associated  morbidity  and mortality  were  not taken  into consideration  for the determination  of 
the no-observed -adverse -effect  level (NOAEL)  of MEDI4736, which  was 100 mg/kg,  the highest  
dose  tested  in these  studies.  
 
The existing  body  of knowledge  suggests  that many  tumors  express  PD-L1 in order  to suppress  or 
evade  immune -mediated  elimination.  To aid in the prioritization  of tumor  types  for inclusion  in the

studies of MEDI4736 (2 employing MEDI4736 as monotherapy and 3 as combination therapy) and 
no studies  have yet been  completed.  The majority  of the clinical  safety  data in this IB are from Study  
CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, which has the greatest number of enrolled subjects as of 18Feb2014 . 
Monotherapy  Studies:  
• Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 -[ADDRESS_41878]-time-in-human  (FTIH),  multicenter,  open -

[IP_ADDRESS]  Monotherapy  Studies  
Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 -[ADDRESS_41879] one dose of MEDI4736 (ranging from 1 to 27 doses). Of these, 
177 subjects received MEDI4736 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W). This study has a dose- escalation 
and a dose-expansion  phase.  For the purpose  of this IB, the safety  data were  combined  from all 177 
subjects  treated  with the 10 mg/kg  Q2W  regimen  of MEDI4736  (i.e., data from subjects  receiving  10 
mg/kg  Q2W  from both dose  escalation  and dose  expansion  were  combined).  In addition,  [ADDRESS_41880] been  enrolled  in the following  dose -escalation  cohorts:  4 subjects  in each  of the 0.1, 0.3, and 1 
mg/kg  Q2W  cohorts;  3 subjects  in the 3 mg/kg  Q2W  cohort,  and 6 subjects  in the 15 mg/kg  Q3W  
cohort.

frequently  reported  (≥ 10% of subjects)  treatment -emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  regardless  of 
grade  or causality  were  fatigue,  dyspnea,  nausea,  constipation,  and decreased  appetite.  The 
majority  of TEAEs  were  Grades  1 to 2 in severity  and manageable  by [CONTACT_40112]4736 study protocols. The Grade 3 or higher TEAEs 
occurring  in 2 or more  subjects  included  dyspnea,  dehydration,  abdominal  pain,  fatigue,  sepsis,  
increased  aspartate  aminotransferase,  increased  gamma - glutamyltransferase,  hyperbilirubinemia,  
back pain, pulmonary  embolism,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_33078],  hypotension,  and “progression  of disease”  
(verbatim  term).  Treatment -related  TEAEs  (all grades)  occurring  in 2 or more  subjects  were  fatigue,  
nausea,  dyspnea,  diarrhea,  vomiting,  pyrexia,  myalgia,  hypothyroidism,  decreased  appetite,  
dizziness,  cough,  pruritus,  rash,  abdominal  pain, increased  aspartate  aminotransferase,  arthralgia,  
asthenia,  influenza -like illness,  edema  peripheral,  increased  alanine  aminotransferase,  headache,  
and dry skin. The SAEs  reported  for 3 or more  subjects  were  dyspnea,  dehydration,  abdominal  pain,  
and sepsis.  Three  subjects  had treatment -related  SAEs:  arthralgia  ([ADDRESS_41882]);  pleural  effusion  and 
pneumonitis  (both  in the same  subject);  and muscular  weakness  and “rule out cord compression”  
(verbatim  term)  (both  in the same  subject).  For the entire  study  population,  none  of the deaths  or 
TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of MEDI4736 in this study were considered related to MEDI4736 . 
No dose -limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  have been  reported.  
Partial  efficacy  data are available  for Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108.  Tumor  assessments  were  
based  on Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  version  1.1 guidelines  with 
modifications for subjects in the dose-expansion phase. Of the 177 subjects treated with MEDI4736

subjects  (5.2%)  had a best response  of PR (unconfirmed).  In addition,  36 subjects  (46.8%)  had 
stable  disease.  
As of 18Feb2014,  PK and pharmacodynamic  data were  available  for the first 32 subjects  following  
IV dosing  of MEDI4736  in Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736 -1108.  MED4736  exhibited  nonlinear  PK likely  
due to saturable  target -mediated  clearance.  Significant  target  engagement,  as measured  by [CONTACT_40113]-L1 (sPD -L1) suppression,  was observed  following  dosing  in all individuals  tested.  Screening  for 
ADA has detected  positive  samples  from [ADDRESS_41884] been enrolled and treated with MEDI4736

3.4 CLINICAL  EXPERIENCE  WITH  OTHER  MONOCLONAL  ANTIBODIES  
TARGETING  THE PD-L1/PD -[ADDRESS_41889]  
Other  MAbs  currently  in development  that target  the PD-1/PD -L1 pathway  have  shown  evidence  of 
clinical  activity.  An antagonist  of PD-1, the primary  PD-L1 receptor,  has a related  mechanism  of 
action  to MEDI4736  and is under  development.  A Phase  [ADDRESS_41890]  (MDX- 
1106  or BMS -936558)  was recently  conducted  in 39 subjects22. No dose -limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  
were  observed  and an MTD was not identified.  One durable  complete  response  (CR)  in CRC,  2 
partial  responses  (PRs)  in RCC  and melanoma,  and 2 mixed  responses  were  observed.  In a larger  
Phase  1 study  of BMS -936558  (MDX -1106)  in 296 subjects,  objective  responses  were  seen  in 
NSCLC  (18%),  melanoma  (28%),  and RCC  (27%).  Antitumor  activity  was observed  at all dose  levels  
and in several  cases,  these  responses  appeared  to be durable,  with responses  ongoing  past [ADDRESS_41891]  common  
treatment -related  AEs of any grade  observed  during  this study  were  fatigue  (24%),  rash (12%),  
diarrhea  (11%),  and pruritus  (10%).  Immune -mediated  AEs of Grade  3 or higher  occurred  in 6% of 
subjects  and included  pneumonitis  (1%),  diarrhea  (1%),  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  increased  
(1%),  and aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  increased  (1%).  Based  on the activity  seen  during  this 
large  Phase  1 study,  BMS -936558  is being  evaluated  in 5 Phase  3 studies  as of March  2013.  
 
Evidence  of activity  has also been  reported  from a Phase  1 clinical  study  of the anti-PD-L1 antibody,  
BMS -936559  (MDX -1105)22. In this study  of 207 subjects,  objective  responses  were  seen  in 
melanoma  (17%),  NSCLC  (10%),  RCC  (12%),  and ovarian  cancer  (6%) at all doses  of 1 mg/kg  or 
higher.  These  responses  also appear  to be durable,  with ongoing  responses  reported  out beyond  [ADDRESS_41892]  commonly  
observed  treatment -related  AEs of any grade  were  similar  to those  observed  with BMS-936558 and 
included  fatigue  (16%),  infusion -related  reaction  (10%),  diarrhea  (9%),  rash (7%),  arthralgia  (7%),  
pruritus  (6%),  and nausea  (6%).  Immune -mediated  AEs of Grade  3 or higher  occurred  in 5% of 
subjects.  
 
Preliminary  data from the dose -escalation  study  of MPDL3280a,  another  anti-PD-L1 antibody  in 
development,  was recently  presented29 . In this dose -escalation  study  of [ADDRESS_41893]  common  AEs of any grade  included  fatigue  (67%),  nausea  (50%),  
diarrhea  (43%),  decreased  appetite  (40%),  chills  (37%),  pyrexia  (37%),  dyspnea  (33%),  headache  
(33%),  pain (33%),  cough  (30%),  and night  sweats  (30%).  Three  patients  experienced  Grade  3 or 4 
events  including  asthenia,  colitis,  and rash.  No pneumonitis  was reported  and no MTD was 
identified.  Taken  together,  the experience  to date with anti- PD-1/PD -L1 MAbs  suggests  that these  
agents  can provide  significant  clinical  activity  across  a range  of tumor  types  with a manageable  
safety  profile  that is superior  to that of the anti-CTLA -4 class.  
Studies  of other  agents  targeting  the PD-1/PD -L1 pathway  are also in early -stage  development  with 
limited  data available.  CT-011 (anti-PD-1 MAb),  has been  evaluated  in a Phase  [ADDRESS_41894]-011 was well tolerated  and no 
treatment -related  toxicities  were  reported.  No MTD was identified  in this population  and clinical  
benefit  was observed  in 33% of subjects.  MK-3475  (anti-PD-1 MAb)  is being  evaluated  in Phase  1 
and 2 studies,  with objective  responses  reported  in NSCLC  and melanoma30. MPDL3280A  
(anti-PD-L1) and AMP -224 (anti-PD-1 fusion  protein)  are also being  evaluated  in Phase  [ADDRESS_41895] -of-care chemotherapy.

3.5 RATIONALE FOR DEVELOPI[INVESTIGATOR_40079]:  (1) we have 
described  that genetic  instability  in CRC  leads  to a diverse  number  of mutations,  each  a potential  
target  for a T-cell mediated  anti-tumor  immune  response  31; (2) several  investigators  have shown  
that effector/memory  T-cells infiltrate  CRC  tumors  and have prognostic  value  25,32; and (3) dMMR  
CRC  is associated  with a profound  anti-tumor  immune  response  with evidence  of TILs.  These  
tumors  are immunogenic  because  they express  tumor  antigens  generated  due to frame  shift 
mutations  caused  by [CONTACT_40114]/deletions  at coding  microsatellites.  Clinically,  these  patients  usually  
have a more  favorable  prognosis,  possibly  from a protective  immune  response  33-35. 
3.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS 
 
The objective of this Phase II study is to determine clinical efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 in 
immunological  subsets  of advanced  CRC.  Subsets  will be prespecified  to ensure  that we include  
those  tumor -types,  considered  to be immunogenic  and therefore  more  likely  to be effectively   
targeted  by [CONTACT_40099].  These  include  patients  with dMMR  and/or  pre-existing  
TILs.  
The research hypothesis is that MEDI4736 will be adequa tely tolerated in subjects with CRC and 
that such  administration  will result  in clinical  benefit.  
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a single  arm, phase  II study.  It will be conducted  to determine  the efficacy  and safety  of 
MEDI4736 in the treatment of immunological subsets of advanced CRC . These subsets will be pre- 
specified  to ensure  that we include  those  tumor -types,  considered  to be immunogenic  and therefore  
more  likely to be effectively  targeted  by [CONTACT_40099].  These  include  patients  
with dMMR  and/ or pre-existing  TILs.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Subjects  with dMMR  CRC  will enroll  into cohort  1 and subjects  with TIL+ CRC  will enroll  into cohort  
2). dMMR status will supersede TIL+ status. All subjects will receive MEDI4736 via IV infusion at 10 
mg/kg  every  two weeks  (Q2W),  as determined  from the ongoing  phase  I study,  which  is currently  
enrolling  patients  into expansion  cohorts  at this dose.  Subjects  will continue  treatment  at Q2W  for 12 
months,  or until progression  of disease,  initiation  of alternative  cancer  therapy,  unacceptable  toxicity,  
or other  reasons  to discontinue  treatment  occur.  
 
Following  the 12-month  treatment  period,  subjects  without  evidence  for progressive  disease  or other  
reason  to discontinue  treatment  will be monitored  without  further  treatment.  Upon  evidence  of PD 
(with or without  confirmation  according  to RECIST  1.1) during  the monitoring  period,  administration  
of MEDI4736  may resume  at the Q2W  schedule,  for up to another  [ADDRESS_41896]  will re- 
sign consent  form prior to retreatment.  The same  treatment  guidelines  followed  during  the initial  12- 
month  treatment  period  will be followed  during  the retreatment  period,  including  the same  dose  and 
frequency  of treatments  and the same  schedule  of assessments.  Treatment  of isolated,  non-target,

lesions  for palliative/  therapeutic  intent  is acceptable  after discussion  with the Principal  Investigator  
(e.g.:  by [CONTACT_40101],  surgery  or radiation).  
 
Tumor  measurements  and determination  of tumor  responses  for this study  will be performed  
according  to RECIST  1.1. 
Subjects  may continue  to receive  MEDI4736 beyond  radiographic  progression  in the absence  of 
clinical  deterioration,  and after discussion  with the Principal  Investigator.  All subjects  will be followed  
for survival  for up to [ADDRESS_41897]  Participation  
 
Subjects  will be treated  until PD, initiation  of alternative  cancer  therapy,  unacceptable  toxicity,  or 
other  reasons  to discontinue  treatment.  All subjects  will be followed  for survival  for up to 2 years  
unless  the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_40080].  
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
MedImmune  will provide  the investigators  with adequate  quantities  of investigational  product.  
 
MEDI4736  is supplied  as a lyophilized  powder  containing  200 mg MEDI4736.  When  reconstituted  
with 4.0 mL of water  for injection  (WFI),  the solution  contains  50 mg/mL  MEDI4736,  26 m M 
histidine/histidine -HCl, 275 mM trehalose  dihydrate,  0.02%  (weight/volume  [w/v])  polysorbate  80, at 
pH 6.0. 
5.1 Storage  of  MEDI4736  
 
MEDI4736 will be stored at 2-8°C (36-46°F) in a secure area with restricted access. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_41898]  be prepared  by [CONTACT_20616] r‟s or site‟s 
designated  investigational  product  manager  using  aseptic  technique.  Commercially  available  WFI 
and 0.9%  (w/v)  saline  will be supplied  by [CONTACT_40115]. Total  in-use storage  time from reconstitution  of 
MEDI4736 to start of administration should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 
2-8°C (36-46°F).  If in-use storage  time exceeds  these  limits,  a new dose  must  be prepared  from new 
vials.  MEDI4736  does not contain  preservatives  and any unused  portion  must  be discarded.  
Reconstitution  of investigational  product  
MEDI4736 requires reconstitution prior to use. The reconstitution should be performed with 4.[ADDRESS_41899]  
foaming.  The vial should  be gently  rotated  or swirled  for 5 minutes  or until dissolution  is complete.  
The vial should  not be shaken  or vigorously  agitated.  Reconstituted  MEDI4736  should  stand  
undisturbed  at room  temperature  for a minimum  of 5 minutes  or until the solution  clarifies.  The 
reconstituted  solution  should  appear  clear  or slightly  opalescent.  A thin layer of bubbles  on the liquid  
surface  is considered  normal.

Doses  will be administered  using  a 250 mL IV bag containing  0.9%  (w/v)  saline  and delivered  
through  an IV administration  set. The volume  of reconstituted  MEDI4736  to add to the IV bag is 
calculated  as follows:  
 
Volume of MEDI4736 (mL) = 
 
Dose  (10 mg/kg)  × Subject  Weight  (kg) ÷ MEDI4736  Concentration  (nominal  50 mg/mL)  
 
Subject  weight  at baseline  should be used  for dosing  calculations  unless  there  is a ≥ 10% change  in 
weight.  An additional  volume  of 0.9%  (w/v)  saline  equal  to the calculated  volume  of MEDI4736  to be 
added  to the IV bag must  be removed  from the bag prior to addition  of MEDI4736.  The calculated  
volume  of MEDI4736  is then added  to the IV bag, and the bag is mixed  by [CONTACT_40116]. Following  preparation  of the dose,  the entire  contents  of the IV 
bag should  be administered  as an IV infusion  over approximately  60 minutes,  using  a 0.2-μm in-line 
filter. Flush  the IV line with a volume  of normal  saline  equal  to the priming  volume  of the infusion  set 
used  after the contents  of the IV bag are fully administered,  or complete  the infusion  according  to 
institutional  policy  to ensure  the full dose  is administered  and document  if the line was not flushed.  
 
Example:  For a subject  weighing  80 kg and dosed  at 10 mg/kg,  16.0 mL [10 mg/kg  × 80 kg divided  
by 50 mg/mL]  of MEDI4736  is to be diluted  in a 250 mL IV bag containing  0.9%  (w/v)  saline.  First,  
16.[ADDRESS_41900] day of dosing  is considered  Day 1. Subjects  will receive  MEDI4736  as an IV infusion  over 
approximately  60 minutes.  The IV line will be flushed  with a volume  of normal  saline  equal  to the 
priming  volume  of the infusion  set used  after the contents  of the IV bag are fully administered  
(unless  prohibited  by [CONTACT_40117]).  
 
Since the compatibility of MEDI4736 with other IV medications and solutions, other than normal 
saline  (0.9%  [w/v] Sodium  Chloride  for Injection),  is not known,  the MEDI4736  solution  should  not be 
infused  through  an IV line in which  other  solutions  or medications  are being  administered.  The date,  
start time,  interruption,  and completion  time of MEDI4736  administration  must  be recorded  in the 
source  documents.  
 
5.3.1  Monitoring of Dose Administration 
 
Subjects  will be monitored  during  and after infusion  with assessment  of vital signs  per institutional  
practice.  
 
In the event of Grade ≤ 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of MEDI4736 may be decreased 
by 50% or interrupted  until resolution  of the event  (up to 4 hours)  and re-initiated  at 50% of the initial  
rate until completion  of the infusion.  In subjects  experiencing  ≤ Grade  2 infusion  reaction,  
subsequent  infusions  may be administered  at 50% of the initial  rate. Acetaminophen  and/or  an 
antihistamine  (e.g.,  diphenhydramine)  and/or  corticosteroids  or equivalent  medications  per 
institutional  standard  may be administered  at the discretion  of the investigator.  If the infusion  reaction  
is Grade  3 or higher  in severity,  treatment  with MEDI4736  will be discontinued.

9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
Eligible  patients  will receive  the following  treatment  every  two weeks  
 
• MEDI4736 at 10 mg/kg i.v. over approximately 60 minutes. 
 
A treatment  may be moved  ± 3 days for administrative  reasons,  including  clinic  closure  for holidays.  
A cycle  constitutes  one completed  administration  of MEDI4736.  
Patients will be seen the day of administration of MEDI4736.  A medical history, with particular 
reference  to toxicities,  including  medication  review,  and physical  examination  will be conducted  at 
each  treatment  visit. 
Laboratory  parameters  for treatment  on Cycle  #1, Day #1 are: 
 
• Absolute  Neutrophil  Count   1500/mm3 
 
• Platelet  Count   90,000/mm3 
• AST and ALT ≤ 3 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects  with liver metastases  
• Bilirubin  ≤ 1.5 × ULN or ≤ 3 × ULN for subjects  with Gilbert‟s disease  
• Serum  creatinine  ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_41914] 
 
Laboratory  parameters  for subsequent  treatments  are as follows:  
 
• Absolute  neutrophil  count   1000/mm3 
 
• Platelet  count   75,000/mm3 
• AST and ALT ≤ 3 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects  with liver metastases

• Serum  creatinine  ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_41915] 
 
If the above  parameters  are not met, then treatment  should  be delayed  one week  (± 3 days)  until 
recovered,  up to a maximum  of 30 days delay.  Re-treat as per section  10.1,  Dose  delay/  
modification . 
 
9.2 RESEARCH  BLOOD AND BIOPSY SPECIMENS 
 
9.2.1  Research  blood  
 
For patients  enrolled  in stage  1, blood  specimens  will be obtained  for research  purposes  within  28 
days prior to treatment  or on Day 1, then Week  2, Week  4, and week  8. An additional  blood  draw  
beyond  week  8 is permitted  based  upon  interesting  clinic/immunological  findings.  
Specimens  should  be collected  prior to drug administration.  Four (4) tubes  of blood  are to be 
collected  in BD Vacutainer®  CPT™  Cell Prepara tion Tubes  with Sodium  Heparin.  Each  tube should  
contain  approximately  10 cc of blood.  Whole  blood  (PAXgene  DNA)  will be collected  from all 
subjects  at baseline  only (appendix  A). Peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells and plasma  will then be 
isolated  per institutional  practice  in the Immune  Monitoring  Facility  (IMF). 
9.2.2  Research  biopsy  
For patients  enrolled  in stage  1, a pre-treatment  tumor  biopsy  will be obtained  from an accessible  
metastatic  or primary  lesion  within  28 days of starting  treatment  and then again  at week  8 (± 1 wk). If 
this is done  by [CONTACT_40121],  then informed  consent  for the will  
be required  per standard  institutional  practice.  Where  applicable,  the same  tumor  lesion  should  be 
biopsied  at baseline  and on-treatment.  
Patients  will be permitted  to continue  enrollment  and treatment  on protocol  in the event  that 
insufficient  material  was obtained  from the biopsy.  The on treatment  biopsy  will not be required  if this 
is no longer  considered  appropriate  at the time of the planned  procedure,  for example,  if the tumor  is 
no longer  accessible,  the procedure  is deemed  to be unsafe,  or if the patient  refuses.  
Tumor  lesion  planned  for biopsy  may be an index  lesion  if  [ADDRESS_41916] one diameter.  
If clinically  practical,  subjects  will undergo  5 core biopsies.   Two core biopsies  will be placed  in 
formalin  and processed  for FFPE,  2 core biopsies  will be immediately  frozen  in liquid  nitrogen  and 
then stored  at -80°C  . The fifth core biopsy  will be placed  in culture  medium   to isolate  tumor  
infiltrating  lymphocytes  or for cell culture  (appendix  B). 
If the patient  undergoes  a routine  procedure,  tissue  may be obtained  for future  correlative  analyses.  
Up to 20 x 5m slides  (unstained)  may be obtained  from each  routine  procedure  where  tissue  was 
extracted.   Tissue  from routine  procedures  may be sent directly  to the IMF facility  for immediate  
processing  (e.g. isolation  of Tumor  Infiltrating  Lymphocytes).  
 
 
9.2 CORRELATIVE STUDIES 
Pharmacodynamic  changes  may be evaluated  for associations  with clinical  activity,  and safety  
(adverse  event)  data.  Tissue  may be used  for correlative  studies  such  as IHC, tumor  mutation  
analysis,  proteomic  analysis,  and immunodiversity.

Whole  blood  (PAXgene  DNA)  will be collected  from all subjects  enrolled  in stage  1 at baseline  and 
may be used  to generate  genomic  DNA for SNP genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_40083].  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_40084]  (e.g. Fc gamma  receptor  genes)  
and with other  immunoregulatory  signaling  pathways  to explore  the possibility  that natural  variation  
within  those  genes  is associated  with response  to MEDI4736  therapy  and/or  with adverse  events  
observed  during  treatment.  HLA genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_40085].  
Flow cytometry  will be performed  at baseline  and during  treatment  to assess  baseline  and changes  
in composition/activation  status  of lymphocyte  subsets  present  in peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cell 
preparations  (PBMCs).  Lymphocyte  subsets  to be assayed  may include,  but are not limited  to CD8+  
and CD4+  T-cell subsets  (activated;  effector/memory;  regulatory)  and populations  of those  cells as 
defined  by [CONTACT_40122],  exhaustion,  or signaling  markers  such  as ICOS,  HLA-DR, 
PD-1, CTLA -4, and/or  intracellular  IFNγ.  NK cell populations  may be moni tored  in a similar  fashion  
with a focus  on characterizing  subsets  defined  by [CONTACT_40123]  (e.g. NKG2D;  
IL-21R) and/or  by [CONTACT_40124] (e.g.,  
CD107a,  granzyme,  perforin).  Additional  flow cytometry -based  assays  will focus  on defining  and 
monitoring  the abundance  of myeloid -derived  suppressor  cells (MDSCs),  a cell type which  appears  
to negatively  impact   anti-tumor  activity  and which  has been  shown  to promote  immune  escape  by 
[CONTACT_40125]8 T-cell infiltration  into the tumor  microenvironment36. 
Immune  cells may be evaluated  using  HLA-A2-restricted  tetramer  assays  to detect  and quantify  the 
presence  of T cells directed  against  specific  antigens  which  are anticipated  to be presented  to the 
immune  system  due to study  treatment.  Detecting  on-treatment  increases  in these  T cell populations  
may be considered  evidence  of adaptive  immune  responses  in CRC.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_41917]  on the clinical  
activity and/or safety of MEDI4736 treatment, the protein concentrations of a panel of cytokines, 
chemokines,  and other  relevant  immunomodulatory,  soluble  factors  may be investigated  by [CONTACT_40126]/or  other  relevant  multiplex -based  protein  assay  methods.  Examples  of analytes  to be assessed  
may include  but are not limited to factors  induced  by [CONTACT_20129]γ signaling  (e.g.,  T cell chemoattractants  
CXCL9;  CXCL10)  and other  factors  generally  involved  in inflammatory  processes.  Plasma  may be 
used  also to assess  the presence  and/or  concentration  of anti-tumor  antibodies  using  a mulitplex  
platform  such  as Invitrogen‟s Protoarray  platform(c).  Levels  of sPD-L1 in peripheral  blood  may also 
be assessed.  
9.2.3  Tissue  Biopsies  and/or  archived  tissue  
 
The presence  of TILs within  tumors  in response  to MEDI4736  treatment  will be evaluated  baseline  
and on-treatment  biopsies  and, when  feasible,  tissue  acquired  from routine  procedures.  Archived  
tissue (up to 20 x 5 m slides),  tissue  acquired  from routine  procedures  (up to 20 x 5 m slides  per 
procedure),  and biopsy  tissue  may be analyzed  using  immunohistochemistry  for PD-L1 expression  
and other  immune -related  genes,  and gene  expression  (microarray  and/or  RT- QPCR)  research  
platforms.  Laser  Capture  Microdissection  may be utilized  to enrich  specific  regions  of tumor  material  
for use in similar  or additional  downstream  applications,  which  may include  in-situ hybridization,  flow 
cytometry,  ELISA,  and/or  assessment  of miRNA.  In all cases,  the goal may be to determine  the 
abundance  of a battery  of immunoregulatory  genes  or proteins  associated  with cancer  cells and/or

10.1 Dose  delay/  modification  
 
Following  the first dose  of MEDI4736,  subsequent  administration  of MEDI4736  should  be modified  
based  on toxicities  observed  as described  in Table  10.1 (below).  All toxicities  will be graded  
according  to NCI CTCAE  v4.03.  Dose  reductions  are not permitted.  Dose  modifications  will not be 
required for AEs that are clearly not attributed to MEDI4736. 
 
Based  on the mechanism  of action  of MEDI4736,  potential  irAEs  may be similar  to those  seen  with 
the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_40086] -1106  including  immune -mediated  enterocolitis,  dermatitis,  hepatitis,  
and endocrinopathies22,37. Subjects  should  be monitored  for signs  and symptoms  of irAEs.  In 
absence  of alternate  etiology  (e.g.,  infection  or PD) signs  or symptoms  of enterocolitis,  dermatitis,  
hepatitis,  and endocrinopathy  should  be considered  to be immune  related.  It is recommended  that 
management  of such  irAEs  follow  table 10.2 and the guidelines  outlined  for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]38.

11.1 SAFETY MONITORING 
Subjects  will be evaluated  for occurrence  of AEs at each  visit.  Events  will be characterized  and 
reported  as described  below.   Safety  will also be monitored  by [CONTACT_40128].  
 
11.1.1  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Definitions  of AEs, non-serious  AE, and serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  are provided  in this section.  
Additionally,  provided  in the sections  below  are reporting  guidelines  for any AE or SAE occurring  
during  this study.  
Definition of Adverse Event and Non-Serious Adverse Event 
 
The following  definition  of AE will be used  for the study:  “Any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a 
subject  or clinical  investigation  subject  administered  a pharmaceutical  product  and which  does not 
necessarily  have to have  a causal  relationship  with this treatment.   An adverse  event  can therefore  
be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or 
disease  temporally  associated  with the use of a medicinal  (investigational)  product,  whether  or not 
related  to medicinal  (investigational)  product.”  
This definition  includes  any abnormalities  or anomalies  that were  not seen  at baseline  or which  
worsened  during  the course  of the study,  if present  at baseline.  
A “non-serious”  adverse  event  is any event  that does not meet  the definition  of “serious  adverse  
event”  as presented,  below.  
 
Reporting  and Treating  Non-Serious  Events  
 
It is the responsibility  of the investigator  to perform  regular  assessments  for AEs.  Subjects  will be 
regularly  queried  about  the occurrence  of any AEs and will be monitored  throughout  the study  for 
reactions  to study  drug and/or  study  procedures.   The investigator  and clinical  staff will record  all 
AEs, whether  volunteered  by [CONTACT_40129],  at any time during  a subject‟s participation  
in the study.   Abnorm  al laboratory  findings  (e.g.,  hematology,  comprehensive  metabolic  panel)  or 
other  abnorm  al assessments  (e.g.,  vital signs)  will be recorded  as AEs if they are judged  as 
clinically significant  by [CONTACT_093].  
All subjects  experiencing  an AE will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_40130]/or  at an acceptable  level.  
Unless  the event  requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (SAE),  medical  treatment  will be provided  to the subjects  at 
the unit and treatment  medication  and/or  medical  procedures  will be provided  per the treating - 
investigato r‟s clinical  discretion.   All clinically  significant  AEs, including  clinically  significant  laboratory  
abnormalities,  will be followed  until resolution.   AEs meeting  the definition  of SAEs  require  special  
reporting  in addition  to documentation  in the CRDB  as described  below.  
All AEs, including  clinically  significant  laboratory  and assessment  abnormalities  will be recorded  
according  to “Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events”  V4.0 (CTCAE)   must  be recorded  
in the CRDB.  Events  occurring  prior to initiation  of first dose  should  be recorded  on the Medical  
History  page  of the CRDB.  Any AE occurring  after initiation  of first dose  of study  drug should  be 
recorded  on the Adverse  Event  page  of the CRDB.  AEs should  be recorded  in the CRDB  using  the 
medical  terminology  found  in the source  documentation.   Whenever  possible,  diagnoses  should  be

given  when  signs  and symptoms  are due to a common  etiology.   It is the investigato r‟s responsibility  
to provide  his/her  assessment  of the relationship  of the event  to the study  drug and the severity  of 
the event  using  the following  scales:  
• Relationship  
 
➢ Unrelated : The AE is clearly  attributable  to a concurrent  illness,  concurrent  medication,  clinical  
state,  or environmental  factor  other  than the investigative  agent.  
➢ Unlikely : The occurrence  of the AE does not follow  the study  in a temporal  sequence  and/or  
based  upon  available  subject  information,  e.g., medical  history,  disease  process,  known  
pharmacology  of drug,  a relationship  between  the drug and AE is unlikely.  
➢ Possible : The AE follows  a reasonable  temporal  sequence  from the time of study  drug 
administration,  but it is possible  that other  factors;  e.g., subject‟s clinical  state  or concomitant  
mediations,  environmental  factors,  or the drug‟s pharmacology  may have caused  the AE. 
➢ Probable : The AE follows  a reasonable  temporal  sequence  from the time of study  drug 
administration,  follows  a known  response  pattern  of the medication  class,  and cannot  be 
reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_40131].  
• Severity  
The severity  of all adverse  events  should  be graded  according  to the Common  Terminology  Criteria  
for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  V4.0.  For those  adverse  events  not listed  in the CTCAE,  the following  
grading  system  should  be employed:  
➢ Mild (CTCAE  Grade  1): Transient  symptoms,  awareness  of sign/symptom,  but easily  tolerated  
and no interference  with subject‟s daily activities  
➢ Moderate  (CTCAE  Grade  2): Marked  signs/symptoms  that interfere  with subject‟s usual  
activities,  but still acceptable  
➢ Severe  (CTCAE  Grade  3): Incapacitating  signs/symptoms  which  cause  considerable  interference  
with the subject‟s daily activities,  unacceptable  
➢ Life-threatening  (CTCAE  Grade  4):  Life-threatening  of disabling  AE 
 
➢ Death  (CTCAE  Grade  5):  Death -related  AE.  See CTCAE  Guidelines  for assigning  Grade  5. 
 
 
11.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
Definition of Serious Adverse Event 
The following  definition  of SAE applies  for the study:  “A serious  AE means  any AE occurring  at any 
dose  that results  in any of the following  outcomes:  death,  a life-threatening  AE, inpatient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088],  a persistent  or significant  
disability/incapacity,  or a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect.   Important  medical  events  that may not 
result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40089]  a serious  AE when,  
based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment,  they may jeopardize  the subject  or subject  and may 
require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition.   A life-

Adverse  Events  as per section  17.2.  
Pregnancies  
 
Any pregnancy  occurring  after the first dosing  is considered  an immediately  reportable  event.   Such  
events  must  be reported  within  one (1) working  day of the investigator  becoming  aware  of the event.  
Subjects  who become  pregnant  during  the trial will be immediately  discontinued  from the study,  but 
shall be followed  for the duration  of the pregnancy.   It is the Principal  investigato r‟s responsibility  to 
provide  to the sponsor  follow -up information  on the outcome  of the pregnancy  including  information  
about  any sequelae.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_41928] to greater  than 3 × ULN and 
concurrent  increase  in bilirubin  to greater  than 2 × ULN.  Concurrent  findings  are those  that derive  
from a single  blood  draw  or from separate  blood  draws  taken  within  8 days of each  other.  Follow -up 
investigations  and inquiries  will be initiated  promptly  by [CONTACT_40132]/or  whether  there  is objective  evidence  that clearly  supports  
causation  by a disease  (e.g.,  cholelithiasis  and bile duct obstruction  with distended  gallbladder)  or 
an agent  other  than the investigational  product.  
Events   of hepatic   function  abnormality  (as  defined  above)  should   be recorded   according  to the 
definitions  of AE and SAE:  
• If an event  of hepatic  function  abnormality  is considered  to be related  to a pre-existing  condition  
and does not represent  a worsening  of this condition  and/or  is considered  to be within  the range  
of normal  physiological  fluctuation  for the subject,  the event  does not meet  the definition  of an 
AE and does  not need  to be recorded  as such.  
• If a definitive diagno sis for an unde rlying condition unrelated to the investigational product is 
established  for an event  of hepatic  function  abnormality,  the diagnosis  should  be recorded  as an 
AE/SAE.  
• If no definitive  diagnosis  is determined  for an event  of hepatic  function  abnormality,  the term 
“hepatic  function  abnormal”  shou ld be used  to report  the AE/SAE.

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
For the purposes  of this study,  patients  will be evaluated  for response  every  4 cycles  (8 weeks),  or 
as clincially  indicated  if interim  toxicity  occurs  mandating  cancer  staging  re-assessment.  RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_41929],  abdomen,  and pelvis  
 
• CT scans  should  be performed  with contiguous  cuts in slice thickness  of [ADDRESS_41930] should  be performed  using  a 5-mm contiguous  reconstruction  algorithm.  
MR I scans  
 
• MRI of the abdomen  and pelvis  is acceptable  for measurement  of lesions  provided  that the 
same  anatomical  plane  is used  for serial  assessments.  If possible,  the same  imaging  device  
should be used for serial evaluations. In case of MRI, measurements will be preferably 
performed  in the axial (transverse)  plane  on contrast -enhanced  T1-weighted  images.  
However,  there  are no specific  sequence  recommendations.  
Measurability  of Tumor  Lesions  
Tumor  lesions  will be categorized  as follows:  
 
• Measurable  Lesions  -  Must be accurately  measured  in at least one dimension  (longest  
diameter  in the plane  of measurement  is to be recorded)  with a minimum  size of: 
• [ADDRESS_41931] scan  (irrespective  of scanner  type)  and MRI (no less than double  the 
slice thickness  and a minimum  of 10 mm) 
• 10 mm caliper  measurement  by [CONTACT_40133]  (when  superficial)  
 
• Malignant  lymph  nodes  are considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a 
lymph  node  must  be ≥ [ADDRESS_41932] scan  (CT scan slice 
thickness  recommended  to be no greater  than 5 mm).  
• Nonmeasurable  Lesions  - Nonmeasurable  lesions  are defined  as all other  lesions  (or sites 
of disease),  including  small  lesions  (longest  diameter  < 10 mm or pathological  lymph  nodes  
with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short  axis).  Lesions  considered  truly nonmeasurable  include  the 
following:  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural/pericardial  effusion,  inflammatory  breast  
disease,  lymphangitic  involvement  of skin or lung, abdominal  masses/abdominal  
organomegaly  identified  by [CONTACT_40134].  
• Target  Lesions  - All lesions  up to a maximum  of 5 lesions  total (and a maximum  of 2 lesions  
per organ)  representative  of all involved  organs  should  be identified  as target  lesions.  It may 
be the case  that, on occasion,  the largest  lesion  does  not lend itself to reproducible  
measurement  in which  circumstance  the next largest  lesion  which  can be measured  
reproducibly  should  be selected.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -109 A(8)  
Approval date: 09 -Apr-2019  
Page  37 of 49  
  
 
• Non-target  Lesions  - It is possible  to record  multiple  nontarget  lesions  involving  the same  
organ  as a single  item on the case  record  form (e.g., “multiple  enlarged  pelvic  lymph  nodes”  
or “multiple  liver metastases”)  
Response  Criteria  
Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
• Complete  Response  - Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes  
(whether  target  or non-target)  must  have reduction  in short  axis to < 10 mm (the sum may 
not be “0” if there  are target  nodes).  
• Partial  Response  - At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the diameters  of target  lesions,  
taking  as reference  the baseline  sum diameters.  
• Progressive  Disease  - At least a 20% increase  in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions,  
taking  as reference  the smallest  sum on study  (this includes  the baseline  sum if that is the 
smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also 
demonstrate  an absolute  increase  of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance  of one or more  
new lesions  is also considered  progression.)  
• Stable  Disease  - Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  increase  to 
qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum of diameters  while  on study.  
Evaluation  of Non-target  Lesions  
• Complete  Response  - Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization  of tumor  
marker  level.  All lymph  nodes  must  be non-pathological  in size (< 10 mm short  axis).  
• Non-complete  response/Non -progressive  disease  - Persistence  of 1 or more  non-target  
lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance  of tumor  marker  level above  the normal  limits.  
• Progressive  Disease  - Unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions  will be 
defined  as the overall  level of substantial  worsening  in non-target  disease  such  that, even in 
presence  of SD or PR in target  disease,  the overall  tumor  burden  has increased  sufficiently  
to merit  discontinuation  of therapy.  In the absence  of measurable  disease,  change  in non- 
measurable  disease  comparable  in magnitude  to the increase  that would  be required  to 
declare  PD for measurable  disease.  Examples  include  an increase  in a pleural  effusion  from 
„trace‟ to „large,‟ an increase  in lymphangitic  disease  from localized to widespread.  
 
Appearance  of New Lesions  
 
The appearance  of new lesions  is considered  PD according  to RECIST  v 1.[ADDRESS_41933] been  observed  with immunotherapy,  new lesions  may not 
represent  true disease  progression.  In the absence  of rapid  clinical  deterioration,  subjects  may 
continue  to receive  treatment  with MEDI4736.  
Evaluation  of Overall  Response  
 
Table  12 provides  overall  responses  for all possible  combinations  of tumor  responses  in target  and 
non-target  lesions  with or without  the appearance  of new lesions.

irRECIST  
 
Due to the potential  for tumors  to appear  larger,  including  new lesions,  prior to response  in 
immunotherapy  trials,  subjects  are permitted  to continue  treatment  beyond  progression.  In 
order  to factor  in the appearance  of new measurable  lesions,  the immune -related  RECIST  
(irRECIST)  is a modified  RECIST  version  1.1 that includes  new measurable  lesions  into the 
sum of the diameters  when  determining  overall  response.  
 
13.1 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
In the absence  of serious  toxicity  or complications,  all patients  will continue  treatment  for up to 2 
years.   In the absence  of treatment  delays  due to adverse  event(s),  treatment  may continue  until one 
of the following  criteria  applies:  
 
• Disease  progression  (unless  the patient  continues  treatment  beyond  progression).  
• Development  of an intercurrent  medical  condition  or need  for concomitant  treatment  that 
precludes  further  participation  in the trial. 
• Unacceptable  toxicity  or any adverse  event  that precludes  further  participation  in the trial. 
• The investigator  removes  the patient  from the trial in the best interests  of the patient.  
• Patient  death.

• Study  completion  or discontinuation  for any reason.  
• Patient  withdraws  consent  to continued  participation  in the trial or is lost to follow  up. 
 
After the end of treatment,  each  subject  will be followed  for 30 days for adverse  event  monitoring  
(serious  adverse  events  will be collected  for 90 days after the end of treatment).  Subjects  who are 
permanently  discontinued  from receiving  investigational  product  will return  for end of study  visit, 
unless  consent  is withdrawn,  the subject  is lost to follow -up or begins  another  treatment.  All subjects  
will be followed  for survival  by [CONTACT_756]  (unless  not otherwise  following  up at Memorial  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])

would  be expected  to be greater  than about  5% in patients  that have  failed  current  regimes.  
A two-stage  Simon‟s optimal  design  will be employed  to test the null hypothesis  that the true 
response  rate is ≤5% versus  the alternative  hypothesis  that the true response  rate is at least 
25% with type I and II error rates  of 10% each.  Each  cohort  will be evaluated  separately  for 
this purpose.   In the first stage,  we will accrue  9 patients  in each  cohort.  If 0 objective  tumor  
responses  (PR or CR) are observed  among  the [ADDRESS_41935] 1 response  is observed   among  the 9 
subjects  treated  in a cohort,  then the study  will be expanded  to enroll  a total of 24 treated  
subjects  in that cohort.  At the end of the study,  if 2 or fewer  objective  tumor  responses  are 
observed  in a cohort,  then the study  will be considered  not worthy  of further  investigation  in 
that particular  cohort .  If at the end of the study  ≥3 tumor  responses  per RECIST1.1  are 
observed in a cohort, then further investigation of MEDI4736 in that patient population will be 
considered  worthwhile.  This study  requires  accrual  of a minimum  of 18 subjects  and up to a 
maximum  of 48 subjects  if both cohorts  are expanded  to the second  stage.  The accrual  time 
is estimated  to be 2 years.  
Antitumor  Activity  
 
Assessments  of antitumor  activity  will be based  on the ORR,  PFS,  and OS. Response  
Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  guidelines  (v1.1)[ADDRESS_41936]  95% CI of ORR  will be estimated  using  the binomial  distribution.  The ORR  defined  
based  on irRECIST  criteria  will also be estimated  using  the binomial  distribution  and exact  
95%CI  will be provided.  Progression -free survival  will be measured  from the start of 
treatment with MEDI4736 until the documentation of disease progression or death due to any 
cause,  whichever  occurs  first. Progression -free survival  will be censored  on the date of last 
tumor  assessment  documenting  absence  of tumor  progression  for subjects  who are still alive 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -109 A(8)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_41937] date of treatment  with MEDI4736. Progression -free survival  will be 
evaluated  using  the Kaplan-Meier method(Kaplan  and Meier,  1958).  Overall  survival  will be 
determined  as the time from the start of treatment  with MEDI4736  until death.  For subjects  
who are alive at the end of study  or lost to follow -up, OS will be censored  on the last date 
when  subjects  are known  to be alive.  The OS will be evaluated  using  the Kaplan -Meier  
method.  
Safety and Tolerability Analyses 
 
All recorded  adverse  events  will be listed  and tabulated  by [CONTACT_2943],  preferred  
term and  treatment.  Any significant  vital signs  and clinical  laboratory  test results  will be listed  
and summarized.  Any significant  physical  examination  findings,  and clinical  laboratory  results  
will be listed.  
Biomarker Analysis 
 
Exploratory  research  studies  will be done  only on the 1st  stage  patients  to evaluate  the effect  
of this therapy  will be performed  using  research  blood  draws  and tumor  biopsies  at baseline  
and at week  8. Cohorts  [ADDRESS_41938]  of MEDI4736  on Tumor  Infiltrating  Lymphocytes  (TILs),  such  
as CD4+  and CD8+  T-cells,  and expression  of tumor  markers,  such  as PD-L1, will be 
assessed  by [CONTACT_40135],  and investigated  graphically  to explore  patterns  of change  
from pre-treatment  to post-treatment  specimens.  
 
The pharmacodynamic  effect  of MEDI4736  on markers  in peripheral  blood,  such  as ICOS,  
HLA-DR, PD-1, CTLA -4; and, serum  proteins,  such  as CXCL9;  CXCL10,  will be assessed  by 
[CONTACT_40135],  and investigated  graphically  to explore  patterns  of change  over time,  i.e.: 
pretreatment,  then week  2, week  4, and week  8. 
 
In addition,  the relationship  of TIL changes  and tumor  marker  expression  with measures  of 
peripheral  blood  markers  will be summarized  descriptively.  Fisher‟s exact  test will be 
employed  to assess  associations  between  categorical  variables  while  Spearman's  rank 
correlation  will be used  for continuous  variables.  Wilcoxon  signed  rank test will be used  to 
test for differences  in continuous  expression  tumor  markers  between  pre- and post-treatment  
specimens  while  McNemar‟s test will be used  to assess  these  relationships  for binary  
markers.  Fisher‟s exact  test will be employed  to assess  associations  between  categorical  
variables

Colorectal  adenocarcinoma  is an adult cancer.  Thus,  the relevance  of these  drug to the 
pediatric  population  has not been  established.  Lactating  and pregnant  women  are also 
excluded  because  of potential  anti-proliferative  effects  of chemotherapy  that may be harmful  
to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_40090].  
 
Benefits:  It is possible  that this treatment  will result  in shrinkage  of colorectal  cancer  or in a 
stabilization  of an otherwise  progressing  disease.  It is not known,  of course,  whether  these  or 
any other  favorable  events  will occur.  It is not known  whether  this treatment  will affect  the 
overall  survival  of the patients.  
 
Costs:  The patient  will be responsible  for the costs  of standard  medical  care,  including,  CT 
scans,  all drug administration  fees and all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  even  for complications  of 
treatment.  MEDI4736 will be supplied to patients by [CONTACT_40139].  Patients will 
not be responsible  for the costs  of  blood  procurement  obtained  for research  purposes  , the 
cost of special  testing  of any tissue  for research  purposes,   or the cost for obtaining  the

Study design
This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, extension study designed to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of a fixed 30 mg dose of benralizumab administered subcutaneously (SC).  
Patients who complete [ADDRESS_355630] been enrolled in this study, subsequent patients (up to a 
maximum of 2200 total for the study), who complete a minimum of 16 weeks, and no more than 40 weeks, in this study, will be given the option to transition to an open-label safety extension 
study, Study D3250C00037 (MELTEMI), which retains patients on the same treatment regimen 
as in this study and contains a simplified set of study assessments.  
Patients choosing to enter Study D3250C00037 will complete an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit in 
this study before transitioning.  Adolescent patients, patients from Japan and South Korea, and 
any patient who chooses not to enter Study D3250C00037 will remain in this study through IPD or EOT and FU.
Once the blind is broken in the predecessor studies, this study (BORA) becomes a single-blind 
design for those patients who had been on active treatment in the predecessor studies. The study will become single-blind for all remaining patients at the time of the Japanese EOT analysis. 
While the Sponsor will be unblinded to regimen for analysis purposes, study conduct and 
blinding at the site and patient level will remain unchanged. 
Adults
Patients previously assigned to an active treatment arm in the predecessor study
Patients previously randomized to the every 4 weeks (Q4W) regimen of benralizumab will 
continue injections of active drug every 4 weeks.

Date 16 December 2016
7(85)Adolescents within the EU who were randomized to placebo in the predecessor study will be 
assigned to benralizumab 30 mg Q8W in this study (every [ADDRESS_355632] 3 doses followed 
by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 8 weeks thereafter).  
After the first 3 doses, adolescent patients within the EU will be receiving open-label treatment 
with IP administered at their bimonthly visit; however, they will still follow an every 4 weeks 
study visit schedule (see Table of Assessments, Table 2 ).
Target patient population
Patients who complete Study D3250C00017, D3250C00018, or D3250C00020 on 
investigational product may be eligible for this study.  
Investigational product and mode of administration
Benralizumab 30 mg/mL solution for injection in an accessorized pre-filled syringe (APFS) OR 
matching placebo in an APFS will be administered SC at the study site according to the dosing 
regimens described below.
Dosage 
Refer to Study Design section above.
Duration of treatment
Adults: This is a 68-week study with the last dose of study drug administered at Week 52.  An 
end of treatment (EOT) visit will be conducted at Week 56.  A final follow-up visit will be 
conducted at Week 68, which is [ADDRESS_355633] dose of study drug.
The total planned study duration is 68 weeks.
Adolescents: This is a 120-week study with the last dose of study drug administered at Week 
104.  An EOT visit will be conducted at Week 108.  A final follow-up visit will be conducted at Week 120, which is [ADDRESS_355634] dose of study drug.
The total planned study duration is 120 weeks.
Statistical methods 
All safety and efficacy parameters will be analyzed descriptively based on the full analysis set.  
The full analysis set includes all randomized patients who received any dose of IP.
Patients that enter the predecessor study as an adolescent (at Visit 1 of the predecessor study) 
will continue to be considered as an adolescent throughout this study, and will thus be assigned to treatment regimen and assessments of an adolescent, irrespective of when they reach 18 years 
of age.  
Data from adult patients choosing to enter the safety extension study, D3250C00037, will be 
summarized separately from those remaining in this study.

18(85)1. INTRODUCTION
1.[ADDRESS_355645] tightness.  Asthma is a leading cause of morbidity with a 
global prevalence of approximately 300 million; it is estimated that the number of people with 
asthma may increase to 400-450 million people worldwide by 2025 ( Masoli
et al 2004 ).
The current approach to anti-inflammatory controller therapy in asthma is based on a stepwise 
intensification of a daily maintenance regimen primarily centered around inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), with the addition of long-acting β
2agonists (LABA) in patients with more severe asthma ( GINA 2015 , NAEPP 
2007 ).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_291374], up to 50% of patients have asthma that 
is not well-controlled ( Bateman et al 2010 ).  This results in considerable impact on quality of 
life, disproportionate use of healthcare resources, and adverse reactions from regular systemic 
steroid use.  Symptom control in children and adolescents with asthma can be similarly 
challenging, due in part to the limitations of current therapeutic modalities.  Longer treatment courses, over a period of months or years, and higher medication doses may be required to 
achieve the maximum possible improvement in lung function in children older than 5 years 
(GINA 2015 ).  Therefore, there remains an unmet medical need for patients whose asthma is 
not controlled by [CONTACT_291439][INVESTIGATOR_014].
The observed variability in clinical response to currently available asthma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_291375], in part, to distinctive inflammatory phenotypes ( Wenzel 2012 ).  In particular, 
asthma associated with eosinophilic inflammation in the airway (often referred to as 
eosinophilic asthma) is common (approximately 40% to 60% of asthmatics) with the degree of 
eosinophilia associated with clinical severity including the risk of asthma exacerbations (Bousquet et al 1990 ; Louis et al 2000 ; Di Franco et al 2003 ; Scott and Wardlaw 2006 , 
Simpson et al 2006 ; Zhang and Wenzel 2007 ).  Adjusting conventional ICS-based asthma 
therapy according to the degree of elevated sputum eosinophils as a marker of disease activity resulted in a reduction in the frequency of asthma exacerbations in prospective trials ( Green et 
al 2002 ; Jayaram et al 2006 ).
Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a cytokine factor essential for eosinophil trafficking and survival 
(Molfino et al 2011 ).  Clinical trials of neutralizing anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab and

completed 1 of the 3 predecessor studies: D3250C00017, D3250C00018, or D3250C00020. 
1.3 Rationale for study design, doses, and control groups
This is a global study designed to continue to investigate the safety of benralizumab in severe 
asthma patients on ICS-LABA therapy with or without chronic oral corticosteroids (OCS) and/or other asthma controllers.  All patients who were assigned to the placebo regimen 
during the predecessor study will be reassigned to receive active drug, while those who 
received active drug during the predecessor study will continue on that same regimen.  This will allow for the collection of safety and efficacy information in some patients for up to 2 
continuous years in adults and 3 continuous years in adolescents. 
Once the blind is broken in the predecessor studies, this study (BORA) becomes a single-blind 
design for those patients who had been on active treatment in the predecessor studies. The 
study will become single blind for all remaining patients at the time of the Japanese EOT 
analysis (see Section 8.5.4 ). While the Sponsor will be unblinded to regimen for analysis 
purposes, study conduct and blinding at the site and patient level will remain unchanged.
1.4 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
There are few treatment options for patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled on high-dose ICS-LABA ( GINA 2015 ).  The evidence base for oral add-on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ie, oral 
corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, and xanthenes) is extremely limited.  Anti-IgE therapy 
(ie, omalizumab) may improve control in patients with severe asthma and IgE-mediated 
allergy to a perennial allergen.  Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_96812] a long-acting bronchodilator that has recently been shown to produce improvement in lung function and exacerbation risk (pooled data) in 
patients with severe asthma, with inconsistent effects on other measures of asthma control 
(Kerstjens et al 2012 ).  As such, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_291377].
Revised Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D3250C00021Edition 4.0
Date 13 January 2016
20(85)In adult patients whose asthma was poorly controlled on medium-to-high dose ICS-LABA 
benralizumab, at fixed doses of ≥20 mg, produced improvements in multiple metrics of 
asthma control including the annual rate of asthma exacerbations, lung function, ACQ-6 
scores, and symptoms (Phase 2b MI-CP220 study, based on the interim analysis).  Clinical benefit appeared to be greatest in patients with blood eosinophil counts >300/ μL.  The blood 
eosinophil count below which benralizumab is generally not effective remains unclear at this 
point in time.
The efficacy and safety of benralizumab in asthmatic patients is being evaluated in studies 
D3250C00017, D3250C00018, and D3250C00020.  In this study, additional risk/benefit 
information will be generated with regard to the impact of benralizumab on asthma exacerbations, lung function, asthma control metrics, AEs and SAEs, and laboratory data.  
Additional information with regard to peripheral blood eosinophil levels and benefit/risk will 
be collected. 
Eosinophils are a prominent feature of the inflammatory response to helminthic parasitic 
infections, and the presence of infiltrating eosinophils has been circumstantially associated 
with a positive prognosis in certain solid tumors.  Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that prolonged eosinophil depletion may diminish the ability to defend against helminthic 
parasites, or negatively impact the natural history of certain malignant tumors.  Risk 
minimization measures include exclusion of patients with untreated parasitic infection and active or recent malignancy, in conjunction with the performance of routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  In addition, the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to 
benralizumab has been documented.  Theoretical risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_291378] (eg, anaphylaxis or immune complex disease).
A detailed assessment of the risk/benefit of benralizumab in patients with asthma is provided 
in the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.5 Overall study design
This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, study designed to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of a fixed 30 mg dose of benralizumab administered subcutaneously (SC).  
Eligible patients will transition from the predecessor study into this follow-on study at the 
End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit of the predecessor study.  Visit 1 of this extension study will be 
scheduled on the same day as the EOT visit of the predecessor study (see Section 4.1.1 ).  
Duplicate assessments will not be required.
Patients will be maintained on their currently prescribed ICS-LABA therapy(ies), throughout 
the treatment period, unless any changes are considered necessary/appropriate at the discretion of the Investigator.
In this study, patients will receive 56 weeks of study treatment (108 weeks for adolescents).  
Patients who enter the predecessor study as an adolescent (at Visit 1 of the predecessor study) will continue to be considered  an adolescent throughout this study, and will thus be assigned

21(85)to the treatment regimen and assessments of an adolescent, irrespective of when they reach 18 
years of age.
A follow-up visit will be conducted at Week 68 (Week 120 for adolescents), which is [ADDRESS_355650] 16 weeks and not more 
than 40 weeks, and will then be asked to transition to an open-label safety extension study, 
Study D3250C00037 (MELTEMI).  Investigators will be provided with the list of patients who will be asked to participate in Study D3250C00037.  
A minimum of [ADDRESS_355651] 3 active doses within this study before transitioning to MELTEMI.
Patients will begin to transition from BORA into this study only after the database lock of the 
initial study into which the individual patient was recruited has been reached, and a positive risk/benefit evaluation of the results from CALIMA & SIROCCO has taken place.  In order to 
maintain the blind of ZONDA, transition of patients that originate from that study will 
commence only after the database lock of ZONDA.  To ensure this strategy is followed, study sites will be instructed by [CONTACT_291440].
To meet certain health authority obligations, adolescent patients and patients from Japan and 
South Korea will remain in this study through IPD or EOT and FU.  Patients choosing not to 
transition into MELTEMI will be allowed to remain in this study through IPD or EOT and 
FU.

Study Code D3250C00021Edition 4.0
Date 13 January 2016
32(85)(d) An asthma-related event requiring mechanical ventilation
All patients who prematurely discontinue IP should return to the study center and complete 
the procedures described for the Premature Investigational Product Discontinuation Visit 
(IPD) within 4 weeks +[ADDRESS_355681] dose of IP and for the final Follow-up visit at 
16 weeks (±7 days) after the last dose of IP (see Table 1 and Table 2 ).  
Reasons for premature discontinuation of IP should be recorded in the eCRF.
3.7 Withdrawal from the study
3.7.1 Withdrawal of Informed Consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IP and assessments) without 
prejudice to further treatment. Patients who discontinue IP will be discontinued from the 
study.  
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any adverse events (AE).  The Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study.  
The enrolment/randomization code of the withdrawn patient cannot be reused.
If patient agrees, he/she will be asked to return to the study center and complete procedures 
described for the IPD and FU visits within 4 weeks (+7 days) and 16 weeks (±7 days) after the 
last dose of IP, respectively .
3.8 Withdrawal of informed consent for donated biological samples 
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be 
disposed of/destroyed and the action documented.  If samples are already analyzed ,
[COMPANY_008] is not obliged to destroy the results of this research.
As collection of the biological samples is an integral part of the study, then the patient is 
withdrawn from further study participation.
If the patient only withdraws consent for the retention of samples for future exploratory use, 
the patient will not be withdrawn from the study.
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461]:
! Ensures patients’ withdrawal of informed consent for the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to [COMPANY_008]
! Ensures that biological samples from that patient, if stored at the study center, are 
immediately identified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action documented
! Ensures the local laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed/destroyed
! Ensures that the patient and [COMPANY_008] are informed about the sample disposal.

42(85)4.1 Enrolment period
4.1.1 Randomization (Visit 1)
Each potential patient or parent/legal guardian (as applicable) will provide written informed 
consent prior to any study specific procedures and undergo assessments applicable for the visit 
(see Table 1 or Table 2 ).
In order to provide sufficient time for patients to consider participation in this study, and to 
ensure an uninterrupted dosing regimen as patients transition between the predecessor study and 
this study, patients will be provided with the ICF at/after the visit at which they receive their last 
dose of IP in the predecessor study and will be asked to sign the ICF at Visit 1 of this study, prior to any study-specific procedures being performed.  
Visit 1 of this study will be scheduled to ensure an uninterrupted dosing regimen as patients 
transition between the predecessor study and this safety extension study.  Therefore, if the actual EOT visit in the predecessor study occurs more than 7 days from the scheduled EOT visit, the 
patient will not be eligible to enrol in this study.  The End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit for the 
predecessor study and Visit [ADDRESS_355692] dose of IP for this study.  If IP cannot be administered at this visit, the patient will not be eligible 
for enrolment in this study.  
As Visit 1 coincides with the EOT visit of the predecessor study, repeated assessments (see 
Table 1 and Table 2 ) are not required, as data will be duplicated programmatically between the 2 
study databases, as applicable  As electronic patient-reported outcome (PRO) devices were used 
to capture ACQ6, AQLQ(S)+12, WPAI+CIQ, EQ-5D-5L in the predecessor studies, the patient does not need to complete the paper versions of these at Visit 1 of this safety extension study.
Registration of patient’s enrolment via IWRS/IVRS should occur on day when other Visit 1 
procedures are done.
Visit 1 assessments are primarily concerned with confirmation of the patient eligibility for the 
extension study 
4.2 Randomized treatment period
4.2.1 Patients that continue for duration of BORA
Patients that will continue for the duration of BORA (comprising the first approximately 1200 
adult patients enrolled in BORA), all patients in Japan and South Korea, and all adolescents will 
follow the procedures described below until completion of the study, or early withdrawal, as 
applicable.
4.2.[ADDRESS_355693] enrolled will be asked to 
transition into the separate safety extension study, MELTEMI, after completing a minimum of 
Revised Clinical Study Protocol

Date 13 January 2016
43(85)16 weeks and a maximum of 40 weeks in BORA (ie, patients may transition at Visit 5, 7, 9, or 
11).
Patients must transition from BORA into MELTEMI at the earliest possible odd-numbered 
BORA visit following all necessary approvals being in place at the study site, AND after 
database lock of the trial in which the patient entered this program (the latter will be confirmed 
to sites once this milestone is reached).  Patients may transition into MELTEMI only at Visits 5, 7, 9, or 11 of this study.
4.2.3 Dosing regimens
[IP_ADDRESS] AdultsPatients previously assigned to an active treatment arm in the predecessor study
Patients previously randomized to the Q4W regimen of benralizumab will continue injections of 
active drug every 4 weeks.  
Patients previously randomized to the Q8W regimen will continue to receive active drug every 8 
weeks with placebo (dummy) injections administered at the 4-week interim treatment visits in order to maintain the blind.
Patients previously assigned to the placebo arm in the predecessor study
All adult patients previously assigned to the placebo arm in the predecessor study will be 
re-randomized to either the Q4W or Q8W regimen (first 3 doses administered every 4 weeks 
followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 8 weeks thereafter).  Patients on the Q4W regimen will receive active drug 
every month.  Patients on the Q8W regimen will receive active drug at Visit 1 (Week 0), Visit 2 (Week 4), Visit 3 (Week 8), followed by [CONTACT_291447], eg, placebo at Visit 4 (Week 12), active drug at Visit 5 (Week 16), placebo at Visit 6 
(Week 20), and so on in order to maintain the blind relative to the Q4W regimen.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adolescents outside the European Union 
Adolescents previously assigned to an active treatment arm in the predecessor study
  Adolescents previously randomized to the Q4W regimen of benralizumab will continue 
injections of active drug every 4 weeks.  
Patients previously randomized to the Q8W regimen will continue to receive active drug every 8 
weeks with placebo (dummy) injections administered at the 4-week interim treatment visits in 
order to maintain the blind.
Adolescents previously assigned to the placebo arm in the predecessor study
Adolescents previously assigned to the placebo arm in the predecessor study will be 
re-randomized to either the Q4W or Q8W regimen (first 3 doses administered every 4 weeks followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 8 weeks thereafter).  Patients on the Q4W regimen will receive active drug

44(85)every 4 weeks.  Patients on the Q8W regimen will receive active drug at Visit 1 (Week 0), Visit 
2 (Week 4), Visit 3 (Week 8), followed by [CONTACT_291438], eg, placebo at Visit 4 (Week 12), active drug at Visit 5 (Week 16), placebo at Visit 6 (Week 20), and so on in order to maintain the blind relative to the Q4W regimen.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adolescents within the European Union 
Adolescents previously assigned to an active treatment arm in the predecessor study
Adolescents within the European Union (EU) will continue to receive only the Q8W dosing 
regimen as per the predecessor study.  In order to maintain the blind of the predecessor study, 
this group will receive the injections every [ADDRESS_355694] 3 doses (active drug at Visits 1 
and 3, placebo administered at Visit 2) followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 8 weeks thereafter (to match the regimen of the adolescents who were on placebo in the predecessor study).
Adolescents within the EU will thereafter be receiving open label treatment.  These adolescent 
patients will follow an every 4 weeks Study Visit schedule; however, investigational product (IP) will only be administered at every other visit after the first 3 doses as described above.
Adolescents previously assigned to the placebo arm in the predecessor study
Adolescents within the EU who were randomized to placebo in the predecessor study will be 
assigned to benralizumab 30 mg every 8 weeks in this safety extension study (every [ADDRESS_355695] 3 doses followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 8 weeks thereafter).
After the first 3 doses, adolescent patients within the EU will be receiving open label treatment 
with IP administered at their bimonthly visit.
With no placebo arm in this safety extension study, adolescent patients within the EU will thus 
be receiving open label treatment.  These adolescent patients will follow an every 4 weeks Study Visit schedule; however, IP will only be administered at every other visit after the first 3 doses as 
described above.
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomized treatment period assessments

serum chemistry, PK, ADA/nAb) may be performed [ADDRESS_355696] be done prior to IP administration.  The patient will receive 56 weeks treatment (108 weeks for adolescents), with the last dose of 
benralizumab administered at Visit 14 (Visit 27 for adolescents).  Adolescent patients in EU will 
be administered IP according to open-label schedule.
Patients will have scheduled visits at 4-week intervals to complete protocol-specific assessments 
and IP administration, as listed in Table 1 and Table 2 ; Restrictions as set out in Section 3.5.2
will continue to apply throughout the treatment period.  In case of an asthma worsening/exacerbation (see Section 5.1.1 ), patients should be evaluated at the study center,

45(85)when feasible, at an unscheduled visit, or ordinary visit if the worsening happens to fall within a 
scheduled visit window.
Patients’ lung function will be monitored at the site, as well as responses to questionnaires (see 
Section 5.3.2 for details).
At Week 56 (Week 108 for adolescents) patients will come to the center for the End of 
Treatment (EOT) visit.
Patients who prematurely discontinue IP (see Section 3.6) should return to the study center and 
complete procedures described for the IPD and Follow-up visits within 4 weeks ( +7days) and 16 
weeks (±7 days) after the last dose of IP, respectively.
Completion or early termination of the treatment will be registered via IWRS/IVRS for each 
patient.
4.3 Follow-up period
Patients who complete Visit 15, Week 56 (Visit 28, Week 108 for adolescents) will return at 
Week 68 (Week 120 for adolescents) for a final follow-up visit.

days, and/or an in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and/or emergency department or urgent care visit.
An asthma exacerbation that occurs ≤[ADDRESS_355698] dose of systemic steroids (oral, 
IM, IV), prescribed for a prior exacerbation, will be counted as the same exacerbation event.
The patient may remain in the study after an exacerbation and continue to receive IP if the 
Investigator judges that it is medically appropriate for the patient to do so.
Study center evaluations for asthma worsening may occur as an unscheduled visit or as part of an 
ordinary center visit if the worsening happens to be coincident with a scheduled visit window. A copy of the medical record should be obtained for exacerbations evaluated and treated at non-
study centers (eg, by [CONTACT_291448]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and details 
entered into the exacerbation eCRF in a timely fashion.  Changes in concomitant medication due to exacerbation must be recorded in the appropriate module of the eCRF.

53(85)Patients will be requested to complete 4 simple questionnaires during particular visits as per 
Table 1 or Table 2 , accordingly.  Data will be collected using a paper form provided to the 
patient by [CONTACT_291453].
[IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Control Questionnaire 
The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) is a shortened version of the ACQ that assesses 
asthma control (nighttime waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, 
wheezing, and short-acting β2 agonist use) omitting the FEV 1measurement from the original 
ACQ score.
Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by [CONTACT_20230] 
1 bronchodilator use question and 5 symptom questions.
Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely 
uncontrolled).  The mean ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses.  Mean scores of ≤0.75 
indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and ≤1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, 
and a score >1.5 indicates not well controlled asthma ( Juniper et al 2006 ).  Individual changes of 
at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.
The questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_291454] a paper questionnaire.Patients will be asked to complete the ACQ-6 at Visit 1 and then every 12 weeks thereafter 
throughout the treatment period including the EOT visit.
The Investigator/authorized delegate will check the patient’s adherence to the ACQ-6, as shown 
in Table 1 or Table 2 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 years and older 
The Standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 years and older (AQLQ(S)+12) is 
a questionnaire that measures the health-related quality of life experienced by [CONTACT_291455].
The questionnaire comprises 4 separate domains (symptoms, activity limitations, emotional 
function, and environmental stimuli).
Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each of the 
questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment).  The 
overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions.  The 4 individual domain scores 
(symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the domains.  Individual improvement in both the 
overall score and individual domain scores changes of ≥0.5 are considered clinically meaningful.
The questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_291456] a paper questionnaire. Patients will be asked to complete the AQLQ(S)+12 at Visit 1 and then every 12 weeks 
thereafter throughout the treatment period including the EOT visit.

refer to IWRS/IVRS manual for further details).
6.4 Accountability
The study drug provided for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol.
The study personnel will account for all study drugs dispensed to the patient.
The monitor will account for all study drugs received at the center, unused study drugs and for 
appropriate destruction.  Certificates of delivery, destruction, and/or return should be signed.
In the case of a malfunctioning APFS, the center should contact [CONTACT_291461] a 
product complaint process according to applicable guidelines. 
6.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
All adults globally, and adolescents outside the EU who were randomized to benralizumab in the 
predecessor study will be assigned to the same dosing regimen in this safety extension study as 
they received in the predecessor study.  Patients who were randomized to the placebo arm in the 
predecessor study will be randomized at Visit 1 of this safety extension study to 1 of the 2 benralizumab dose regimens (in a ratio of 1:1).  Randomization codes will be assigned strictly 
sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization in accordance with stratification in 
this study.  All adolescents within the EU will be assigned to the 30mg every 8 weeks dose regimen regardless of the treatment assignment in the lead-in study.
Patients who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria should not, under any circumstances, 
be enrolled or receive study medication.  There can be no exceptions to this rule.
6.6 Methods for ensuring blinding
[COMPANY_008] staff involved in the study, the patients, and the investigators involved in the 
treatment of the patients, or in their clinical evaluation, will not be aware of the dosing regimen allocation, except in the case of adolescents within EU (who only receive the every 8 weeks dosing regimen, and who therefore will be on open label treatment in this study).
Placebo solution will be visually matched with benralizumab solution.  Both benralizumab and 
placebo will be provided in an accessorized pre-filled syringe.
Center staff who are directly involved in the patient’s management should remain blinded to any 
eosinophil, basophil, and monocyte results included as part of outside lab reports up to and including Visit 2 in order to maintain the blind of the predecessor study.  To help ensure this, each investigational center will designate an individual (eg, administrator or another ancillary person) not directly involved in patient management, to receive and blind any eosinophil, basophil, and monocyte results prior to the report being handed over to the center staff involved in the patient’s management and prior to filing as a source document.  Similarly, eosinophil and basophil results must be redacted from all communications with the Sponsor.

59(85)After database lock has been declared in each of the predecessor studies (CALIMA, SIROCCO, 
and ZONDA), the treatment codes will be broken and the data from these studies will be analyzed and reported. Once the blind is broken in these studies, this study (BORA) becomes a single-blind design for those patients who had been on active treatment in the predecessor studies. The study will become single blind for all remaining patients at the time of the Japanese EOT analysis (see Section 8.5.4 ). While the Sponsor will be unblinded to regimen for analysis 
purposes, study conduct and blinding at the site and patient level will remain unchanged.
To prevent complete unblinding of this study, treatment-revealing information will not be shared 
with the study site or patients (patient-level listings, as well as other treatment-revealing information will be redacted from the Clinical Study Reports).
6.7 Methods for unblinding 
Individual treatment codes indicating the treatment dosing regimen randomization for each randomized patient will be available to the Investigator(s) or pharmacists at the study center from the IWRS/IVRS.  Further detail on how to unblind a patient’s treatment dosing regimen allocation will be described in the IWRS/IVRS user manual provided to each study center.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment dosing regimen randomization.  
The Investigator is to document and report the action to [COMPANY_008] without revealing the treatment given to patient to the [COMPANY_008] staff.
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to break the code for serious adverse events (SAEs) that are 
unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned 
analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual patient 
have been made and documented.
To protect the blind of this study and of the predecessor studies (CALIMA, SIROCCO, and 
ZONDA), patients who transition from this study into Study D3250C00037 (MELTEMI) will be 
unblinded to treatment regimen only after signing the ICF for MELTEMI, at which point they will have exited BORA.
6.[ADDRESS_355722] administration and treatment compliance
The administration of all study drugs (including IP) should be recorded in the appropriate 
sections of the CRF.
The IP will be administered at the study center on treatment visits and within visit windows as 
specified in Table 1 and Table 2 .  In cases when a treatment visit cannot be scheduled within the 
specified window, the IP administration should be skipped.  If 2 consecutive doses of the IP or 
more than 2 of the scheduled doses of IP are missed during course of the study the patient should be discontinued; please refer to Section 3.6.

60(85)If an Investigator decides to skip the IP administration due to exacerbations, the above rule does 
not apply.
Before investigational product administration
Prior to each IP administration:
! Investigator/authorized delegate will assess injection site as per standards of medical 
care
! For all WOCBP, including all adolescent females, a urine pregnancy test will be done.  
IP must only be administered when the result of the test is negative (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
IP administration
The IP will be administered by [CONTACT_737]/authorized delegate.  It is advised that the site of 
injection of the IP be rotated such that the patient receives IP at a different anatomical site at 
each treatment visit.  Suggested injection site rotation sequence is presented below (see Figure 
3).  The injection site must be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF at each treatment 
visit.
Figure 3 Injection sites and rotation scheme
In the case when rotation of the injection site is not favourable for the patient and/or Investigator, 
the reason should be recorded in the source documents.  The injection site of the IP should be recorded in the source documents and eCRF at each treatment visit.
Further details on IP administration are provided in the IP Handling Instruction.  IP 
administration must be carried out in line with the Instruction.
After investigational product administration
After IP administration, the patient should be observed for a minimum of 2 hours for the 
appearance of any acute drug reactions.

61(85)Conditions requiring investigational product administration rescheduling 
If any of the following should occur, the Investigator should reschedule the visit and the IP 
should not be administered until the rescheduled visit:
! The patient has an intercurrent illness, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_291420] (eg, viral illnesses)
! The patient, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is experiencing an acute or emerging

anaphylaxis management are provided in Appendix E .
Anaphylaxis will be defined as a serious reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death 
(Simpson et al 2006 ).  Anaphylaxis typi[INVESTIGATOR_96684] 1 of 3 clinical scenarios:
! The acute onset of a reaction (minutes to hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both, and at least 1 of the following: a) respi[INVESTIGATOR_291421] b) reduced blood pressure or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction
! Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_291422]: involvement of the 
skin/mucosal tissue, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], reduced blood pressure or associated 
symptoms, and/or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms
! Reduced blood pressure after exposure
Patients will have had a pre-assessment (ie, vital signs and lung function) prior to IP 
administration) and should be observed after IP administration for a minimum of 2 hours for the 
appearance of any acute drug reactions. 
In order to help understand the potential drug-relatedness of any acute reaction, a blood sample 
should be drawn during the event for additional ADA testing (if not already scheduled for this 
visit).  Serum tryptase or other blood or urine testing relevant to the diagnosis of anaphylaxis may be obtained at a local lab at the discretion of the Investigator.

62(85)7. SAFETY REPORTING
7.1 Adverse events
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153188].
7.1.1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An 
undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, 
enlarged liver), or the abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition 
occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been 
administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs.
7.1.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, 
washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
! Results in death
! Is immediately life-threatening
! Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
! Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions
! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
! Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see  Appendix B to the Clinical Study Protocol 
(CSP).
7.1.3 Recording of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Time period for collection of adverse eventsAll AEs, including SAEs, will be collected from the time the patient signs the informed consent 
at Visit 1 throughout the treatment period and including the follow-up period (Visit 16, Week 68 (Visit 29, Week 120 for adolescents).  AEs, including SAEs that started during the predecessor

63(85)study and are ongoing at the start of this safety extension study, will be followed up for the 
duration of the study and as long as medically indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at follow-up in the study will be followed up by [CONTACT_68484], but without further recording in the CRF.  [COMPANY_008] retains the 
right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of 
the study, if judged necessary.
The requirement to follow-up AEs is not intended to delay database lock or production of the 
Clinical Study Report (CSR).  These activities should proceed as planned with ongoing AEs if 
necessary.
Any follow-up information of ongoing SAEs after database lock will be reported to [COMPANY_008] 
(see Section 7.1.4 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Variables 
The following variables will be collected for each AE;
! AE (verbatim)
! The date when the AE started and stopped
! Maximum intensity of the AE
! Whether the AE is serious or not
! Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no)
! Action taken with regard to IP
! AE caused patient’s withdrawal from study (yes or no)
! Outcome
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 7.1.2 .  An AE of severe intensity need 
not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between the IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or 
‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_33249]?’
For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.

Study Code D3250C00021Edition 4.0
Date 13 January 2016
64(85)A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in  Appendix B to the CSP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_178556]: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last 
asked?’ , or revealed by [CONTACT_129158].  When collecting 
AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and 
symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded 
separately.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the 
clinical study report.  Deterioration as compared with baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory 
values and vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE 
criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP.
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will 
be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible, the reporting Investigator will use the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low hemoglobin value).  In the 
absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as 
compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
NB. Cases in which a patient shows an AST or ALT ≥3xULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN 
may need to be reported as SAEs (please refer to Appendix D  ‘Actions required in cases of 
combined increase of Aminotransferase and Total Bilirubin – Hy’s Law’, for further 
instructions).
[IP_ADDRESS] Symptoms of the disease under study
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list 
of signs and symptoms. Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, 
dyspnoea, breathlessness and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs only when:
! The sign or symptom is serious according to definitions, see Section 7.1.2
! The patient discontinues the study due to the sign or symptom 
! The sign or symptom is new to the patient or not consistent with the patient’s pre-
existing asthma history (defined as within 1 year of Visit 1) as judged by [CONTACT_1275].

symptom should also be recorded as an AE.
7.1.[ADDRESS_355724] to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the 
study procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other center personnel will 
inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 
24 hours from when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within 1
calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar days 
of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up will be undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other center personnel will inform 
[COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours from when he or she becomes aware of 
it.
Once the Investigators or other center personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert will be sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study center personnel is to 
report a SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_756].
The [COMPANY_008] representative will advise the Investigator/study center personnel how to 
proceed.
The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the [COMPANY_008] 
drug.
7.2 Overdose
! An overdose with associated AEs will be recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on 
the relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module
! An overdose without associated symptoms will be reported on the Overdose CRF 
module only
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators 
or other center personnel will inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours from when he or she becomes aware of it.

relevant information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site.
For overdoses associated with a SAE, standard reporting timelines apply, see Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_355725] 16 weeks (5 half-lives) after last administration of the IP.
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study IP should be discontinued 
immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_280819] a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.   The outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, 
or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient was 
discontinued from the study.
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other center personnel 
inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 
24 hours from when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 5 
days for SAEs (see Section 7.1.4 ) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.
The pregnancy (PREGREP) module in the CRF will be used to report the pregnancy and the 
pregnancy outcome (PREGOUT) module will be used to report the outcome of the pregnancy.
7.3.2 Paternal exposure 
Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 
weeks (5 half-lives) following the last dose.
Pregnancy of the patient’s partners will not be considered an AE.  However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented for conceptions occurring from

8. EVALUATION AND CALCULATION OF VARIABLES
8.1 Statistical considerations
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_244979].  The statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) will be prepared prior to first patient randomized.  Subsequent amendments will be 
documented ahead of database lock for the planned analyses (Section 8.5.4 ) if necessary.     
8.2 Sample size estimate
Patients who complete the double-blind treatment period on IP in 1 of the predecessor studies, 
D3250C00017, D3250C00018, and D3250C00020, may be eligible to enrol into this study.  With an estimated rollover rate of >90% from these preceding studies, this safety extension study 
will enrol approximately [ADDRESS_355726] 3 active doses within this study 
before transitioning to MELTEMI.
The study is not designed to power the statistical testing of any null hypothesis.
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets
In the analysis sets outlined below, data from adult patients choosing to enter the safety 
extension study, D3250C00037, will be summarized separately from those remaining in this 
study (BORA) unless otherwise noted in the SAP.

based on this analysis set.
8.4 Variables for analyses
8.4.1 Calculation or derivation of efficacy variables
All efficacy objectives will be evaluated for the treatment period, defined as the period after 
administration of IP at Visit 1 to the conclusion of the EOT visit, inclusive.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exacerbation rate
The annual asthma exacerbation rate will be used as an efficacy variable.
An asthma exacerbation is defined in Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_355728] day of a temporary increase in a stable oral corticosteroid background dose, or the date of discharge from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], whichever occurs later.  In the primary analysis, the number of exacerbations observed for a patient during the 56-week treatment period (108-weeks in adolescents) will be used as response variable.
Additional systemic corticosteroid treatments, emergency room /urgent care visits requiring use 
of systemic corticosteroids for at least [ADDRESS_355729] 7 days in which neither criterion is fulfilled.
Maximum on-treatment follow-up time for exacerbations for a patient is approximately 56 weeks 
(108 weeks for adolescents); defined as the time from first dose to the date of EOT.  For a patient lost to follow-up, this will be defined as the time from randomization to the time point after which an exacerbation could not be assessed.
For the production of summary statistics, the annual exacerbation rate in each treatment group 
will be calculated using the time-based approach.
Annual Exacerbation Rate=Total Number of Exacerbations*365.25/ Total duration of
follow-up within the treatment group (days).
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to first exacerbation 
Time to first exacerbation will only be calculated for the patients who were randomized to 
placebo in the lead-in study and is calculated as follows:

The time to first asthma exacerbation for patients who do not experience an asthma exacerbation 
during the treatment period will be censored at the date of their last visit for the treatment period, or at the time point after which an exacerbation could not be assessed (for lost-to-follow-up 
patients).
[IP_ADDRESS] Forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] [ADDRESS_355730]-randomization visits (post Visit 1 up to and 
including the EOT visit) will be used as secondary efficacy variables.  
The last measurement recorded prior to the first dose (Visit 1) will be used as baseline FEV
1. 
8.4.2 Calculation or derivation of safety variable(s)
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety variables
The following safety data will be collected: vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, 
hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and reported AEs.
Change from baseline to each post-treatment time point where scheduled assessments were made 
will be calculated for relevant measurements.  Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_153288].
8.4.3 Calculation or derivation of patient reported outcome variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Control Questionnaire In the ACQ-6 questionnaire the subjects are asked to recall the status of their asthma during the 
previous week with regards to symptom and BD.  The questionnaire includes questions on
!Awakened at night by [CONTACT_23805]
!Limitation of normal daily activities
!Waking in the morning with symptoms
!Dyspnoea
!Wheeze
!Daily rescue medication
The questions of the ACQ-6 are measured on a 7-point scale scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 
6 (severely uncontrolled).  The ACQ-6 score is computed as the un-weighted mean of the responses.
Asthma control responder status (Improved, No change, Deterioration) will be categorized 
according to the following limits ( Juniper et al 2005 ):
! ACQ-6 (End of treatment – baseline) ≤-0.5 → Improvement
! -0.5< ACQ-6 (End of treatment– baseline) <0.5 → No change

Asthma control status will be categorized according to their ACQ-6 end of treatment score as 
follows ( Juniper et al 2006 ):
! ACQ-6 (End of treatment) ≤0.75 → Well controlled
! 0.75< ACQ-6 (End of treatment) <1.5 → Partly controlled
! ACQ-6 (End of treatment) ≥1.5 → not well controlled
The primary outcome for those not previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor 
study will be improvement from baseline (Visit 1) in asthma control as defined above.  The 
primary outcome for those previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study will be 
maintenance of asthma control defined as either improvement or no change from baseline (Visit 1).
[IP_ADDRESS] Standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 years and older 
The AQLQ(s)+12 is a 32 question health-related quality of life assessment.  Respondents are 
asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each of the 32 
questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment).
The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions.  The 4 individual domain 
scores (4 domains assessing 1) symptoms, 2) activity limitations, 3) emotional function, and 4) environmental stimuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the domains.All patients will be categorized according to the following definitions:
! AQLQ(S)+12 (End of treatment – baseline) ≥0.5 → Improvement
! -0.5 < AQLQ(S)+12 (End of treatment – baseline) <0.5 → No change
! AQLQ(S)+12 (End of treatment – baseline) ≤-0.5 → Deterioration
The primary outcome for those not previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor 
study will be improvement from baseline (Visit 1) as defined above.  The primary outcome for 
those previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study will be maintenance of 
health-related quality of life defined as either improvement or no change from baseline (Visit 1).
[IP_ADDRESS] Health Care Utilization and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment 
The ten questions included in the WPAI+CIQ are as follows:
1 = currently employed (yes/no) 
2 = hours missed work due to health problems 3 = hours missed work due to other reasons 
4 = hours actually worked 
5 = degree health affected productivity while working (0-[ADDRESS_355731])6 = attends class in an academic setting (yes/no)

For the work related questions, the following calculations should be used to create the variables 
of interest:
! Number of work hours missed = Q2
! Absenteeism = Q2/(Q2+Q4) 
! Presenteeism = Q5/10 
! Work Productivity Loss = Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)] 
! Activity Impairment = Q10/[ADDRESS_355734]: 
! Number of class hours missed = Q7
! Absenteeism = Q7/(Q7+Q8) 
! Presenteeism = Q9/10 
! Absenteeism+Presenteeism = Q7/(Q7+Q8)+[(1-Q7/(Q7+Q8))x(Q9/10)]
! Activity Impairment = Q10/[ADDRESS_355735] described above (number of work/class hours 
missed, absenteeism, presenteeism, and work productivity loss and activity impairment) when 
comparing the values at the EOT to baseline (Visit 1).  The primary outcome for those previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study will be no change in the variables 
of interest when comparing values at the EOT visit to baseline (Visit 1).
[IP_ADDRESS] EQ-5D-5L
The distribution of responses for each of the five dimensions will be summarized by [CONTACT_765].  The 
change from baseline (Visit 1) on the visual analogue scale will also be evaluated.  The primary outcome for those not previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study will be a higher mean score on the visual analogue scale at the EOT visit compared with the baseline visit (Visit 1).  The primary outcome for those previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study will be no change in mean scores on the visual analogue scale at the EOT visit compared to the baseline visit (Visit 1).

Due to the limited sampling schedule, the PK assessment will be primarily based on the observed 
steady-state serum trough (predose) concentrations, C
trough.
8.4.5 Calculation or derivation of immunogenicity variables
ADA assessments will be conducted utilizing a tiered approach (screen, confirm, titer).  The 
presence of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) will be tested in all ADA-positive samples using a 
ligand binding assay.

73(85)[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis methods for safety variables
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_291466] (treatment period and 
follow-up period).  AEs will be listed for each patient and summarized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) assigned to the event by [CONTACT_61132].  Laboratory safety variables will be summarized using standard summary statistics and plots as appropriate.  Other safety variables will be summarized as appropriate.  Further details will be provided in the SAP.
Laboratory data for hematology and clinical chemistry will be summarized.  The frequency of 
changes with respect to normal ranges between baseline and each post-treatment time point will be tabulated.  Frequencies of clinically noteworthy values (defined in the SAP) occurring during the clinical study will also be given.  Shifts from normal to abnormal between baseline and each post-baseline time point will be evaluated for urinalysis.  Changes in vital signs and ECGs will be examined at each visit and at endpoint.  Frequencies of clinically noteworthy values (defined in the SAP) occurring during the clinical study will be presented.  Shifts from normal to abnormal between baseline and follow-up will be evaluated for the physical examination.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis methods for pharmacokinetic variables
The PK analyses will be performed at or under the guidance of [COMPANY_008] Research and 
Development.
Benralizumab serum concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics at each visit 
by [CONTACT_291465].
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis method for immunogenicity variables
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to benralizumab will be summarized using descriptive statistics at 
each visit by [CONTACT_291465].  ADA titers-time profiles of 
benralizumab by [CONTACT_291467]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis methods for healthcare utilization and patient reported outcomes
The ACQ-6 and AQLQ(s)+12 outcome variables for those not previously randomized to 
benralizumab in prior studies will be the change in scores (ACQ-6/AQLQ(s)+12 and domains) from baseline to Week 56/EOT (Week 108/EOT in adolescents).  Baseline is defined as the Visit 1 observation in this study (pre-treatment for these patients).  Additionally, subjects not previously randomized to benralizumab will be categorized by [CONTACT_291468] 56/EOT (Week 108/EOT in adolescents) (Juniper et al 2005 ; Juniper et al 2006 ).
The outcome variable for those previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study 
will be maintenance of asthma control status (ACQ-6) and health-related quality of life(AQLQ(s)+12) at Week 56/EOT (Week 108/EOT in adolescents). Maintenance of control status in these patients previously treated with benralizumab will be evaluated several ways: 
(i) The proportion of those with improvement or no change in ACQ-6 score from baseline 
to Week 56/EOT (Week 108/EOT in adolescents) will be compared with the 
Revised Clinical Study Protocol

Date 13 January 2016
74(85)proportion of those with deterioration from baseline at Week 56/EOT (Week 108/EOT 
in adolescents).  
(ii) The proportion of those patients with improvement or no change in ACQ-6 score from 
baseline to Week 56/EOT (Week 108/EOT in adolescents) will be calculated for each 
baseline state (well, partially, not well controlled).  
(iii) The proportion of post-baseline ACQ-[ADDRESS_355736]-baseline ACQ-6 observations indicating well or partially controlled 
asthma will be calculated for patients in those states at baseline and separately for those not well controlled at baseline.  
Asthma control responder status (Improved, No change, Deterioration) will be categorized 
according to the following limits ( Juniper et al 2005 ):
! ACQ-6 (End of treatment – baseline) ≤-0.5 → Improvement
! -0.5< ACQ-6 (End of treatment– baseline) <0.5 → No change
! ACQ-6 (End of treatment– baseline) ≥0.5 → Deterioration
Asthma control status will be categorized according to their ACQ-6 end of treatment score as 
follows ( Juniper et al 2006 ):
! ACQ-6 (End of treatment) ≤0.75 → Well controlled
! 0.75< ACQ-6 (End of treatment) <1.5 → Partly controlled
! ACQ-6 (End of treatment) ≥1.5 → not well controlled
To evaluate maintenance of HRQoL the proportion of those with improvement or no change in 
AQLQ(s)+12 total and domain scores from baseline to Week 56/EOT (Week 108/EOT in adolescents) will be calculated, as will the proportion of those with deterioration from baseline at Week 56/EOT (Week 108/EOT in adolescents).  These descriptive statistics will be calculated for each ACQ-6 control category as defined previously.  
Health-related quality of life responder status will be defined as (Juniper et al 1994):
! AQLQ(S)+12 (End of treatment – baseline) ≥0.5 → Improvement
! -0.5 < AQLQ(S)+12 (End of treatment – baseline) <0.5 → No change
! AQLQ(S)+12 (End of treatment – baseline) ≤-0.5 → Deterioration
For the ACQ-6, the distribution of patients who are well-controlled, partly controlled, and not 
well-controlled will be summarized descriptively for each of the visits in which the assessment was completed.  The level of improvement based on the ACQ-6 and the AQLQ(S)+12 will also 
be summarized descriptively for each of the visits in which the assessment was completed.

75(85)For the EQ-5D-5L, the distribution of responses for each of the 5 dimensions assessed will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_765].  The change from baseline (Visit 1) on the visual analogue scale will also be evaluated.  The primary outcome for those not previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study will be a higher mean score on the visual analogue scale at the EOT visit compared to the baseline visit (Visit 1).  The primary outcome for those previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study will be no change in mean scores on the visual analogue scale at the EOT visit compared to the baseline visit (Visit 1). 
The mean rates of healthcare utilization by [CONTACT_152985] (in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency 
department visits/urgent care visits combined, unscheduled outpatient visits, and all unscheduled 
healthcare encounters will be summarized over the treatment period.  The primary outcome for those previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study will be no change in the 
mean rate of healthcare encounters by [CONTACT_291469].  The primary outcome for those not previously treated with benralizumab in 
the predecessor study will be mean rates of healthcare encounters by [CONTACT_291470].
The number and percentage of patients employed and attending classes will be summarized for 
Visit 1 and the EOT visit.  The number of work hours missed and the number of class hours missed due to asthma as well as the 4 summary scores of absenteeism, presenteeism, absenteeism 
+ presenteeism combined, and activity impairment will also be summarized for Visit [ADDRESS_355737] (number of work/class hours 
missed, absenteeism, presenteeism, and work productivity loss and activity impairment) when 
comparing the values at the EOT to baseline (Visit 1).  The primary outcome for those previously treated with benralizumab in the predecessor study will be no change in the variables 
of interest when comparing values at the EOT visit to baseline (Visit 1).

subject’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_291427] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the s tudy, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study.
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
Examples of such events are:
• Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment
• Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatment with N-acetylcysteine
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
• Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

3A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CA[LOCATION_003]LITY QUESTION
The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable 
possibility” that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
• Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the 
suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?
• Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties?
• Dechallenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96699]?
• No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_291478], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
• Rechallenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally recommend or support 
arechallenge.
• Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship?
A “reasonable possibility” could be considered to exist for an AE where one or more of these 
factors exist.
In contrast, there would not be a “reasonable possibility” of causality if none of the above 
criteria apply or where there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course but any 
dechallenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous or there is another more likely cause of 
the AE.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
• Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug?
• Is there a known mechanism?
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a “reasonable possibility” of a causal 
relationship unless further evidence becomes available to refute this. Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified 
as no reasonable possibility.

International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 3 
categories 
(http://ww w.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.htm) .For 
transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk groups was 
removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edition (2005). Infectious 
substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt. There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:

Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A. Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2.  They are assigned the following UN

3(7)1. INTRODUCTION
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry.  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver 
biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_62684] (IMP).
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
2. DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) and Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any point during the study irrespective 
of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).  The elevations do not have to occur at the 
same time or within a specified time frame.
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN andTBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can 
be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, 
viral hepatitis, another drug.  The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a 
specified time frame.
3. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:
! ALT ≥ 3xULN
! AST ≥ 3xULN
! TBL ≥ 2xULN
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (M EDI-563)
Study Code D3250C00021Edition Number 1
Date 18 July 2014
4(7)When a patient meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the 
central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] 
representative).
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the 
identification criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
! Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by [CONTACT_2237]
! Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory CRF module(s) with the original 
local laboratory test result
When the identification criteria are met from central or local laboratory results the Investigator 
will without delay:
! Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section  2of this Appendix 
for definition) by [CONTACT_48886] (including 
both central and local laboratory results)
4. FOLLOW-UP
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Inform the [COMPANY_008] representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria.
! Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol.
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study Team 
The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact [CONTACT_48887]:
! Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated 
! Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (M EDI-563)
Study Code D3250C00021Edition Number 1
Date 18 July 2014
5(7)! Complete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
! If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures
5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW 
CASES
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
No later than [ADDRESS_355751] and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
! If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
! If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
! Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes. 
∀The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
∀As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (M EDI-563)
Study Code D3250C00021Edition Number 1
Date 18 July 2014
6(7)! Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and 
causality assessment as per above
! Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the 
outcome of the review
6. ACTIONS REQUIRED WHEN POTENTIAL HY’S LAW
CRITERIA ARE MET BEFORE AND AFTER STARTING STUDY TREATMENT 
This section is applicable to patients who meet PHL criteria on study treatment having 
previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment.
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being, even if there has been no 
significant change the patient’s condition# compared with pre-study treatment visits, the 
Investigator will:
! Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative who will inform the central Study Team. 
! Follow the subsequent process described is Section  4.2 of this Appendix.
# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.
7. ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR REPEAT EPI[INVESTIGATOR_291429]’S LAW
This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has 
already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.
The requirement to conduct follow-up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.  
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question:
! Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met 
chronic or progressing malignant disease << or did the patient meet PHL criteria

7(7)prior to starting study treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as 
described in Section  6>>?
If No: follow the process described in Section  4.2 of this Appendix
If Yes:
Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condition#compared with 
when PHL criteria were previously met
! If there is no significant change no action is required
! If there is a significant change follow the process described in Section 4.2 of this 
Appendix
# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.

2( 5 )1. INTRODUCTION
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. The World Health
Organization has categorized anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups, which are clinicallyindistinguishable: immunologic [IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated (eg, IgG and immunecomplex mediated) and nonimmunologic (Johansson et al, 2004). The clinical criteria fordefining anaphylaxis for this study are listed in section  2. A guide to the signs and symptoms
and management of acute anaphylaxis is provided in section 3. Appropriate drugs, such as
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc, and medical equipment to treat anaphylacticreactions must be immediately available at study sites, and study personnel should be trainedto recognize and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines.
If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a blood sample will be drawn from the patient as soon as
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for
analysis of serum tryptase.
2. CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR DEFINING ANAPHYLAXIS AND 
IMMUNE COMPLEX DISEASE
Anaphylaxis
In adults, anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:
1.  Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin,
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING(a) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
PEF, hypoxemia).
(b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction
(eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence).
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for
that patient (minutes to several hours):
(a) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush,
swollen lips-tongue-uvula).
(b) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
PEF, hypoxemia).

3( 5 )(c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope,
incontinence).
(d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting).
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several
hours): Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from
that patient’s baseline.
Immune Complex Disease
Immune complex disease or Hypersensitivity Type III is evoked by [CONTACT_291480]-antibody-complement complexes on cell surfaces, with subsequentinvolvement of breakdown products of complement, platelets, and polymorphonuclear
leukocytes, and development of vasculitis; serum sickness and nephritis is common.
3. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS AND MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE 
ANAPHYLAXIS
Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal multi-system allergic reaction in which some or
all of the following signs and symptoms occur:
!   Diffuse erythema
!  Pruritus
!  Urticaria and/or angioedema
!  Bronchospasm
!  Laryngeal edema
!  Hypotension
!  Cardiac arrhythmias
!  Feeling of impending doom
!  Unconsciousness
            !          Shock
Other earlier or concomitant signs and symptoms can include:

4.[ADDRESS_355752], breathing, circulation, and adequacy of mentation
2. Administer epi[INVESTIGATOR_291430] 5-15 minutes, in appropriate doses, as
necessary, depending on the presenting signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, to control signs
and symptoms and prevent progression to more severe symptoms such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506],
hypotension, shock and unconsciousness.
4.2  Possibly appropriate, subsequent measures depending on response          
to epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial Secondary:  
• To evaluate the steady -state safety profile of tazemetostat when co -administered as a 
single and  twice daily oral dose with rifampin in subjects with advanced malignancies.  
• To evaluate the steady -state PK of tazemetostat and its metabolites after administration 
alone and with rifampin.  
Study Design:  
This is a phase 1, 2 -part, multi -center, open -label , PK, and safety study.  
Methodology:  
This two -part study is designed to characterize the steady -state PK of oral tazemetostat and its 
metabolite EPZ 6930 when administered as a single and twice daily dose in subjects with advanced 
malignancies while taken alone or in combination with either itraconazole or rifampin ( Figure 1 ).  
Part 1: Tazemetostat and Itraconazole Drug Interaction  
Part 1 of the study will evaluate the drug- drug int eraction between tazemetostat and itraconazole in an 
open-label, fixed sequential cross over design (Figure  2).  
A scree
ning visit will occur within 30 days of signing an informed consent form (ICF). During the 
screening ph
ase, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility to participate in the study. Subjects who 
meet the protocol criteria may be admitted in the evening t o the clinical study center, or visit the 
clinic if staying locally, on day -1. For Cycle 1, subjects may be admitted to the clinical study center 
during PK sampling periods or must agree to stay locally with frequent clinic visits as required and optional  admission to the center, if available. Prior to dosing on day [ADDRESS_59680] eligibility 
will be reconfirmed. On day 1, a single oral dose of 400 mg tazemetostat will be administered in the 
morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) followed by 2 days of multiple blood sampling (day 1 – 3). From day 3 – 14, 
subjects will receive an oral 400 mg dose of tazemetostat twice daily (12 hours apart, once in the 
morning [eg, 7 – 9 am] and once in the evening [eg, 7 – 9 pm]). In the evening of day 14, subjects 
may be admitted to the clinical study center. On day 15, a single oral dose of 400 mg tazemetostat will be administered in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) followed by 3 days of multiple blood sampling 
(day 15 – 18). From day 18 – 20, a single dose of oral 200 mg itraconazole wi ll be administered daily 
in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal. In the evening of day 20, subjects may be admitted to the 
clinical study unit. From day 21 – 35, subjects will receive an oral 400 mg dose of tazemetostat twice 
daily, once in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) and once in the evening (eg, 7 – 9 pm), co-administered in 
the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal with a single dose of oral 200 mg itraconazole followed by 1 
day of multiple blood sampling (day 21 – 22). In the evening of day 35, subjects  may be admitted to 
the clinical study center. On day 36, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 400 mg tazemetostat co-administered in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal with a single dose of oral 200 mg 
itraconazole followed by 3 days of multiple blood sampling (day 36 – 39). Itraconazole will also be 
administered on day 37 and 38 as a single oral 200 mg daily dose in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a 
meal. Note:  Tazemetostat will not be administered on day [ADDRESS_59681] e 
collection, safety assessments will be conducted on day 39. Sparse PK samples will be collected pre-dose (0 hour) and [ADDRESS_59682] -dose on day 25, 28, 31, and 34.  
Subjects may discontinue from the study after completion of Cycle 1 or can continue treatme nt (Cycle 
2+ onwards) until Investigator -assessed clinical progression per standard practice, or unacceptable 
toxicity, or until another discontinuation criterion is met. For subjects continuing tazemetostat treatment at the recommended therapeutic dose (oral 800 mg tazemetostat twice daily [12 hours 
apart]), Cycle 2 will begin on day 40 (Cycle 2 Day 1) and each subsequent cycle from Cycle 2+ 
onwards will be of 28- day duration. Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the subject ’s 
participation.  Subjects will be instructed to report any adverse events that occur up to [ADDRESS_59683] at f or s af et y a s s e s s m e nt.

Note:  Laboratory results  obtained dur ing screening should be used to determine eligibility criteria. In 
situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted range, the Investigator may retest the subject and the subsequent within range screening result may be used to det ermine the subject ’s 
eligibility. Subjects may be retested once within [ADDRESS_59708]’s diagnosed type of advanced malignancy on complete blood count (CBC) 
testing. 
12. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test (beta-human chori
onic gonadotropin [β -hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL or 
equivalent units of β -hCG) at screening and within [ADDRESS_59709] dose of study 
drug. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are naturally postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutively amenorrhoeic [amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential] and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (ie, total hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, with surgery completed at least [ADDRESS_59710] dose of study drug).  
13. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must either practice complete abstinence or agree to use a highl
y effective method of contraception beginning at least [ADDRESS_59711] 
dose of study drug, during study treatment (including during dose interruptions), and for [ADDRESS_59712]. The 
following are examples of highly effective methods of contraception (result in a failure rate of 
<1% per year when used consistently and correctly):  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Hormonal (ovulation inhibitory combined [estrogen and progesterone]: oral, intravaginal, 
or transdermal; ovulation inhibitory progesterone -only: oral, injectable, or implantable)  
NOTE: Due to the potential of enzyme induction with tazemetostat, hormonal 
contracepti
on methods must  be supplemented with a barrier method of contraception 
(preferably male condom)  
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
• Partner ’s vasectomy (if medically confirmed [azoospermia] and sole sexual partner)  

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59713] 2021 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial NOTE: Female subjects of childbearing potential exempt from these contraception 
requirements are subjects who practice complete abstinence from heterosexual sexual contact. 
True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post -ovulation  
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
14. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (with medically confirmed azoospermia) OR must either practice complete abstinence or agree to use a latex or synthetic condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a female of childbearing potential (FCBP) from the first dose of study drug, during study treatment (including during dose interruptions), and for 3 
months after study drug discontinuation.

5.1. Background 
Post-translational modifications of histones, the core proteins of chromatin, play an important 
role in controlling the fidelity of cellular gene transcription patterns. One of the critical 
transcription -controlling histone modifications is methylation of specific lysine and arginine 
residues, catalyzed by [CONTACT_55368] (HMTs) which all use S -adenosyl methion ine 
(SAM) as a co -factor for the methylation reaction (Copeland, 2013) . Geneti c alterations in a 
number
 of HMTs or associated regulatory proteins have been identified in several human cancers 
where they are purported to be oncogenic. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic 
subunit of the multi-protein polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that catalyzes the mono-, di, 
and trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) ( Margueron, 2011).  
Enhancer of zeste homolog-2 mutation and/or over- expression  has been observed in several 
cancer types, leading to an aberrant H3K27 trimethyla tion (H3K27me3) state which is oncogenic 
(Chase, 2011) . For instance, somatic EZH2 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations at three hotspots 
(Y646, A682, and A692 [
NM_001203247]) are found in 10% to 20% of follicular lymphoma 
(FL) and diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL). These GOF mutations result in an oncogenic 
dependency on EZH2 production of abnormally high H3K27me3 levels, and resultant 
transcriptional reprogramming of the cell (Morin, 2010).  
5.1.1. Hematologic  Malignancies  
Somatic mutations within the EZH2 gene on 3 hotspots (Y646, A682, and A692 [NM_001203247]) a
re present in follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B -cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) and lead to high levels of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in these lymphomas. 
Those mutations of EZH2, therefore, have been proposed to be required for the development and 
maintenance of the mutation -bearing lymphomas. Inhibition of EZH2 leads to reduction in 
H3K27me3 and cell death in lymphoma cell lines bearing the mutation. In addition, loss of 
function of mixed lineage leukemia protein 2 (MLL2) and histone acetyl transfer ases (HATs) 
may generate abnormal methylation states of H3K27, potentially leading to a dependency on 
EZH2. In nonclinical models, inhibition of EZH2 leads to reduction in H3K27me3 in all 
lymphoma cell lines irrespective of their EZH2 mutation status. While cells with wild -type 
EZH2 are growth inhibited with EZH2 inhibition in vitro, only mutant bearing cells undergo cell 
death in culture ( Beguelin, 2013; Knutson, 2014).  
Changes to the tumor microenvironment, for instance those affecting antitumor immunity, are 
increasingly recognized as an important mechanism in lymphomagenesis, affecting all types of NHL ( Scott, 2014) . Epi[INVESTIGATOR_55334] (Wrangle, 2013) , and EZH2 inhibition may 
induce si
milar effects. In addition, loss of EZH2 has been described as affecting T helper cell 
plasticity ( Tumes, 2013)  and is proposed to inhibit the function of regulatory T cells ( Arvey, 

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59739] 2021 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial 2014; DuPage, 2015; Yang, 2015) , suggesting that EZH2 inhibition may contribute to enhancing 
antitumor i
mmunity.  
In summary, the available nonclinical data suggest that EZH2 mutant lymphomas should show 
the highest s
ensitivity to EZH2 inhibition, but wild- type cases could also be affected  through 
tumor cell autonomous mechanisms (mutations in MLL2, HATs, ubiquitously transcribed 
tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome [UTX], etc) and/or effects of EZH2 inhibitors on the 
tumor microenvironment.  
5.1.2.  Solid Tumo rs 
In addition to the EZH2 GOF activation mutations described above, overexpression or 
amplific
ation of EZH2 has been described in numerous tumor types, including but not limited to 
bladder, breast cancer, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, mesothelioma, uveal 
melanoma, renal carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and stomach cancer (Kuroki, 2014; LaFave, 
2015; Comet, 2016) . This is partially explained by [CONTACT_12363]2 gene expression by 
[CONTACT_12364]-E
2F pathway, which is dysregulated in many tumor types ( Bracken,  2003) . In many of 
these t
umors, EZH2 has been demonstrated to function as an oncogene ( Comet, 2016 ). For 
instance, EZ
H2 overex pression promotes anchorage-independent growth and cell invasion in 
breast cancer (Kleer, 2003), proliferation and epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer 
(Takawa, 2011; Tiwari, 2013) , and tumorigenesis and metastasis in prostate cancer (Min, 2010) .  
The
se dat
a suggest that inhibition of EZH2 might also be beneficial in solid tumors that 
overexpress
 EZH2 or contain amplifications of the EZH2 gene.  
5.2. Tazemetostat  
5.2.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Tazemetostat (EPZ -6438) is a h ighly selective small molecule inhibitor of the histone -lysine 
methyltransferase EZH2 gene. Tazemetostat inhibits both wild -type (WT) and mutant EZH2 
mutated at residues Y641, A677G and A687 with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) 
ranging from 2-38 nmol/L. The compound shows a 36- fold selectivity over the most closely 
related HMT, EZH1, and greater than a 4500- fold selectivity over other HMTs. It selectively 
inhibits intracellular H3K27 methylation in a concentration - and time- dependent manner in all 
cell lines tested in vitro to date.  
Additional details are provided in the current tazemetostat In vestigator ’s  Brochure (IB). 
5.2.2. Pharmacok inetics  
Tazemetostat is orally bioavailable in subjects with hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. 
The abso
rption is rapid with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) of 1 to 2 
hours. The mean absolute bioavailability was approximately 33% (Study EZH-103). In dose 
escalation studies in subjects with hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, tazemetostat 
exhibited a more than dose -proportional increase in exposure (area under the concentration- time 
curve [AUC] and maximum concentration [C max]). At the recommended therapeutic dose of 800 
mg twice daily, the mean steady state C max was 829 ng/mL and AUC from 0 to 12 hours (AUC 0-
12) was 3340 ng•hr/mL. The consistent t max and apparent elimination half- life (t 1/2) across the

in pediatric subjects (n=109). The risk of T- LBL/T-ALL in adults is not known; however, the 
incidence of treatment -related T -LBL/T-ALL in adults is expected to be uncommon. As of 12 
April 2021, over 954 subjects (adults and pediatric) have been  treated with tazemetostat as 
monotherapy and in combination with no other reported cases of T- LBL/T- ALL.  
As tazemetostat is a bromide salt, bromide levels  were measur ed in the phase 1 study of 
tazemetostat in adults (Study E7438-G000-101) and pediatric subjects (Study EZH-102). As of 
12 April 2021, bromide elevation was reported in 5 (5%) of [ADDRESS_59758]

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design 
This two -part study is designed to characterize the steady -state PK of oral tazemetostat and its 
metabolite EPZ 6930 when administered as a single and twice daily dose in subjects with 
advanced malignancies while taken alone or in combination with either itraconazole o r rifampin 
(Figure 1 ).  
Part 1: Taz
emetostat and Itraconazole Drug Interaction  
Part 1 of the study will evaluate the drug- drug in teraction between tazemetostat and itraconazole 
in an open-label, fixed sequential cross over design ( Figure 2) .  
A screening visit will occur within 30 days of signing an informed consent form (ICF). During the screening
 phase, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility to participate in the study. Subjects 
who meet the protocol criteria may be admitted in the evening to the clinical study center,  or visit 
the clinic if staying locally, on day -1. For Cycle 1, subjects may be admitted to the clinical study 
center during PK sampling periods or must agree to stay locally with frequent clinic visits as required and, optional admission to the center, if available. Prior to dosing on day [ADDRESS_59762] eligibility will be reconfirmed. O n day 1, a single oral dose of 400 mg tazemetostat will 
be administered in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) followed by 2 days of multiple blood sampling (day 1 – 3). From day 3 – 14, subjects will receive an oral 400 mg dose of tazemetostat twice daily (12 hour s apart, once in the morning [eg, 7 – 9 am] and once in the evening [eg, 7 – 9 pm]). 
In the evening of day 14, subjects may be admitted to the clinical study center. On day 15, a single oral dose of 400 mg tazemetostat will be administered in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) followed by 3 days of multiple blood sampling (day 15 – 18). From day 18 – 20, a single dose of oral 200 mg itraconazole will be administered daily in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal. In 
the evening of day 20, subjects may be admitted to the clinical study unit. From day 21 – 35, subjects will receive an oral 400 mg dose of tazemetostat twice daily, once in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) and once in the evening (eg, 7 – 9 pm), co-administered in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal with  a single dose of oral 200 mg itraconazole followed by 1 day of multiple blood 
sampling (day 21 – 22). In the evening of day 35, subjects may be admitted to the clinical study center. On day 36, subjects will receive a single oral dose of [ADDRESS_59763] at co -
administered in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal with a single dose of oral 200 mg itraconazole followed by 3 days of multiple blood sampling (day 36 – 39). Itraconazole will also be administered on day 37 and 38 as a single oral 200 mg daily dose in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal. Note:  Tazemetostat will not be administered on day 37 and 38. After the 72-
hour PK sample collection, safety assessments will be conducted on day 39. Sparse PK samples will be collected pre -dose (0 hour) and [ADDRESS_59764]-dose on day 25, 28, 31, and 34. 
Subjects may discontinue from the study after completion of Cycle 1 or can continue treatment (Cycle 2+  o
nwards) until Investigator- assessed clinical progression per standard practice, or 
unacceptable toxicity, or until another discontinuation criterion is met. For subjects continuing tazemetostat treatment at the recommended therapeutic dose (oral 800 mg tazemetostat twice daily [12 hours apart]), Cycle 2 will begin on day 40 (Cycle 2 Day 1) and each subsequent cycle from Cycle 2+ onwards will be of [ADDRESS_59765] ’s participation. Subjects will be instructed to report any adverse events

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59782] 2021 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial 7.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in the study assuming about a 40% drop out rate to 
achieve 12 subjects who complete each part of the study for a total of 24 completed subjects. 
Subjects will complete either Part 1 or Part 2, but not both.  
Subjects who require a tazemetostat dose interruption or reduction during Cycle 1 of either Part 1 
or Part 2 wi
ll be replaced. During Cycle 1, subjects who miss two or more consecutive 
tazemetostat/itraconazole/rifampin doses or more than three tazemetostat/itraconazole/rifampin 
doses in total will be replaced. Subjects who miss two or more consecutive PK blood sample 
collections during either part of Cycle [ADDRESS_59783] number and complete each eCRF. 
Subjects will be assigned to the study as follows: 
Part 1:  Tazemetostat and Itraconazole Drug Interaction ( Figure 2 ) 
P
art 2:  Tazemetostat and Rifampin Drug Interaction ( Figure 3) 
Part 1: Tazemetostat and Itraconazole Drug Interaction  
Subjects in Part 1 of the study will receive a single oral, 400 mg dose of tazemetostat on Day 1, 
15, and Day 36. The subjects will receive tazemetostat (oral 400 mg dose) tablets to be taken twice daily from Day 3 – 14 and Day 21 – 35. In addition, the subjects will receive oral 200 mg 
itraconazole once daily from Day 18 – 38. Detailed schedule of assessments is provided in 
Table  3.  
Note:  Subjects will not be dosed with tazemetostat on day 2, from day 16 – 20, 37, and 38.  
Part 2: Tazemetost at and Rifampin Drug Interaction  
Subjects in Part 2 of the study will receive a single, oral, 800 mg dose of tazemetostat on Day 1, 15 and Day 24. The subjects will receive tazemetostat (oral 800 mg dose) tablets to be taken 
twice daily from Day 3 – 14 and Day 17 – 23. In addition, the subjects will receive oral 600 mg 
rifampin once daily from Day 17 – 25. Detailed schedule of assessments is provided in  Table  4.  
Note:  Subjects will not be dosed with tazemetostat on day 2, 16, and 25. 
7.4. Restrictions During Study Treatment 
Subjects will abstain from ingesting Seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, and foods/beverages that contain those, for [ADDRESS_59784] 2021 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial Subjects should avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight while receiving study treatment. In 
addition, subjects should take other measures to avoid ultraviolet exposure including tanning 
beds. Use sunscreen, sunglasses, and protective clothing whenever outside. 
7.5. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
7.5.1. Dose Modification 
Tazemetostat dose interruptions and reductions will not be allowed in Cycle 1 (both Part 1 and Part 2). Dos
e modification only applies to Cycle [ADDRESS_59785] be discussed with the Medical Monitor before treatment can be resumed. Dose-
limiting toxicities are covered in Section  7.5.2.  
Toxicity will be managed by [CONTACT_12382] (as appropriate), treatment interruption, 
dose reducti
on, and treatment discontinuation, or a combination of these. During treatment with 
tazemetostat, dose interruption and reduction for subjects who experience tazemetostat- related 
toxicity will be in accordance with the instructions in  Table  2. If a case of adult T -LBL/T -ALL 
oc
curs enrollment will be suspended, and the benefit-risk of the drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_55369]. For any MDS/AML or oth er myeloid malignancies like MPN, tazemetostat will be 
discontinued.  
For subjects who require dose interruption due to tazemetostat -related to xicity after Cycle 1 of 
the study, the treatment may re -start once the toxicity has been resolved to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_59786] meet the following 
retreatment
 criteria:  
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75 × 109/L 
• Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be ≥1,000/mm3 (≥ 1.0 × 109/L) for

a Screening:  Screening should be performed within 30 days before day 1.  
b End of Study:  Subjects will have a safety follow -up visit, including disease assessment, 30 (±3) days after the last dose of tazemetostat, or prior to initiation of 
an investigational agent or cytotoxic chemotherapy, whichever occurs first. A blood sample will also be required for PK assessment.  
 c Prior to dosing, assessments must be performed to determine if subject continues to meet  eligibility criteria. If screening assessments are preformed within 24 
hours prior to day -1 (baseline assessments), ie, day -2, they do not need to be repeated on day -1. 
 d For Cycle [ADDRESS_59804] the option to be admitted to the clinical s tudy center in the evening of day -1, 14, 20, and 
35. During these admissions, laboratory assessments may be performed within 24 hours prior to when required on day 1, 15, 21,  and 36.  
e Clinic Vi sit: Subjects will visit the clinical study unit from day - 1 to day 3, from day 15 to 18, 21 to 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, and from day 36 to day 39 (Cycle 1). 
Cycle 2 day 1 will begin on day 40 (+ 3 days) and for subsequent cycles, clinic visit will be on day 1 (± 3 days). There will be a final clinic visit at the end of 
study.  
f Medical History/Current Medical Conditions:  General and disease -specific medical history including a history of past and current medical conditions will be 
recorded during screening. Current medical conditions will be updated on day -1. 
g Demographics:  Date of birth, gender, ethnicity, and race must be recorded.  
h Prior and Concomitant Medications: All prior medications administered 30 days before study drug administration will be recorded. Concomitant 
medications will be recorded throughout the study.  
i Pregnancy/Post -Menopausal Testing:  For all FCBP, a serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening and within 24 hours (day -1) of the first dose of 
study drug in Cycle 1. For Cycle 2+, pregnancy testing to be performed on day 1 of each cycle prior to dosing of study drug. Subsequent testing at Cycle 2+ 
and at the end of study visit can be either urine or serum. Any positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed with a serum test. Postmenopausal f emales: 
defined as 12 months with no menses prior to screening and a serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) >40 IU/L at screening only.  
j Vital signs:  Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and temperature (T) must always be measured after the subject has been sitting for 5 minutes. Vital signs will 
be assessed at screening and during each clinic visit. See Table  9 for timing window allowances. When vital signs are to be obtained concurrently with PK or 
other 
blood samples, the vital sign measurements will be performed before blood samples are collected in order to maximize the accuracy of blood sampling 
times while minimizing the potential effects of blood collection on other safety assessments.  
k ECG:  ECG collection will occur after a [ADDRESS_59805]- tazemetostat dose (Cycle 1 day 1, 15, 21, 25, 28, 31, 34, and day 36), prior to dosing at [ADDRESS_59806] -tazemetostat BID dose ( Cycle 1 day 22),

ion of 48 hour PK sample. A single ECG will be recorded unless there is an abnor mality, such as prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate using 
Fridericia ’s formula (QTcF) >[ADDRESS_59809] -dose. On  days when an ECG assessment and a PK blood sample collection are scheduled at the same time, the ECG assessment will 
be performed prior to collection of the PK blood sample.  
l PK Blood Sample:  Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained pre -dose (0 hour), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 (day 21 – 22), 36, 48 (day 1 – 3), and up to 
[ADDRESS_59810]- dose (day 15 – 18 and day 36 – 39). Sparse PK samples will be collected pre -dose (0 hours) and [ADDRESS_59811]-dos e timepoints that coincide with 
dosing of study drug(s) (ie, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hour) must be collected prior to dosing of the subject at that timepoint.  
m AEs/SAEs:  AEs/SAEs and non -serious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signs the consent form until the end of the safety reportin g 
period (or until screen failure). The safety reporting period ends [ADDRESS_59812].  
n Laboratory Assessments: Lab assessments for Cycle 1 will be performed at screening, day 1, 3, 15, 18, 21, 22, 36, and day 39. For all subjects, labor atory 
assessments may be performed within 24 hours prior to the day on which they are required (ie, day -1, 2, 14, 17, 20, 21, 35, and 38) to ensure results are 
available for review prior to dosing of study drug(s) the following day. For Cycle 2+, laboratory assessments will be perform ed at the beginning of each cycle 
on day [ADDRESS_59813] of the clinical laboratory tests to be conducted. In addition, a complete peripheral 
blood sm
ear morphology assessment (see Blood Smear Guidance  in laboratory manual) will be performed manually or automated along with routine 
hematology testing at screening and during the study by [CONTACT_12082]. If the peripheral blood smear morphology result s are abnormal and suggestive of 
MDS/AML or MPN, the subject will undergo a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy procedure. The bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy sample will then be analyze d by 
[CONTACT_55371] (eg , del 5q, chr 7, abn) and MPN (eg, 
JAK2 V617F). Additional local laboratory testing of genetic aberrations associated with MDS/AML or MPN can be conducted using  targeted next generation 
sequencing (NGS) of known disease genes, as necessary. If local testing  is unavailable or if results are inconclusive/indeterminate, the site will be required to 
ship samples for central laboratory testing. If the cytogenetic testing and, if conducted, DNA sequencing by [CONTACT_55372], tazemetostat will be discontinued. See Section  12.3.7  for further details.  
o Tazemetostat Administration (QD):  During Cycle 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 400 mg tazemetostat on day 1, 15, and day 36 in the morning 
(eg, 7 – 9 am).  
p Tazemetostat Administrat ion (multi- dose): Subjects will receive an oral 400 mg dose of tazemetostat twice daily during Cycle 1 from day 3 –14 and day 21 
– day 35. During subsequent cycles (Cycle 2+), dosing will begin on day 1 whereby [CONTACT_55373] 800 mg tazemetostat twi ce daily. Tazemetostat is to 
be taken twice daily 12 hours apart, once in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) and once in the evening (eg, 7 – 9 pm).  
q Itraconazole Administration (QD):  During Cycle, subjects will receive oral 200 mg itraconazole once daily from day 18 to 38 in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) 
after a meal.  
r Disease Assessment:  Disease progression (PD) will be determined through Inve stigator assessed review of clinical status.

a Screening:  Screening should be performed within 30 days before day 1.  
b End of Study:  Subjects will have a safety follow -up visit, including disease assessment, 30 (±3) days after the last dose of tazemetostat, or prior to initiation of 
an investigational agent or cytotoxic chemotherapy, whichever occurs first. A blood sample will also be required for PK assessment.  
 c Prior to dosing, assessments must be performed to determine if subject continues to meet eligibility criteria. If screening assessments are preformed within 24 
hours prior to day -1 (baseline assessments), ie, day -2, they do not need to be repeated on day -1. 
 d For Cycle [ADDRESS_59817] the option to be admitted to the clinical study center in the evening of day -1, 14, and 23. 
During these admissions, laboratory assessments may be performed within 24 hours prior to when required on day 1, 15 and 24.  
e Clinic Visit:  Subjects will visit the clinical study unit from day - 1 to day 3, from day 15 to 17, 19, 21, and from day 24 to day 26 (Cycle 1). Cycle 2 day 1 will 
begin on day 27 (+ 3 days) and for subsequent cycles, clinical visit will be on day 1 (± 3 day s). There will be a final clinic visit at the end of study.  
f Medical History/Current Medical Conditions:  General and disease -specific medical history including a history of past and current medical conditions will be 
recorded during screening. Current medical conditions will be updated on day -1. 
g Demographics:  Date of birth, gender, ethnicity, and race must be recorded.  
h Prior and Concomitant Medications: All prior medications administered 30 days before study drug will be recorded. Concomitant medications will be 
recorded throughout the study. 
i Pregnancy/Post -Menopausal Testing:  For all FCBP, a serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening and within 24 hours (day -1) of the first dose of 
study drug in Cycle 1. For Cycle 2+, pregnancy testing to be performed on day 1 of each cycle prior to dosing of study drug. Subsequent testing at Cycle 2+ 
and at the end of study visit can be either urine or serum. Any positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed with a serum test. Postmenopausal females: 
defined as 12 m onths with no menses prior to screening and a serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) >40 IU/L at screening only.  
j Vital signs:  Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and temperature (T) must al ways be measured after the subject has been sitting for [ADDRESS_59818] 2021 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial other blood samples, the vital sign measurements will be performed before blood samples are collected in order to maximize th e accur a cy of blood sampling 
times while minimizing the potential effects of blood collection on other safety assessments.  
k ECG:  ECG collection will occur after a [ADDRESS_59819]- tazemetostat dose (Cycle 1 day 1, 15, 17, 19, 21, and day 24), prior to dosing at [ADDRESS_59820] -tazemetostat QD dose (Cycle 1 day 3 and 26), 
beginning of each cycle (day 1) from Cycle 2 onwards, and at the end of study visit. As no study drugs are administered on day 26 of Cycle 1, perform ECG 
per 48-hour timepoint timing tolerance window in  Table  9 prior to collection of 48 hour PK sample. A single ECG will be recorded unless there is an 
abnorm
ali
ty, such as prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’ s formula (QTcF) >[ADDRESS_59821] -dose. On days when an ECG assessment and a PK blood 
sample collection are scheduled at the same time, the ECG assessment will be performed prior to collection o f the PK blood sample.  
l PK Blood Samples:  Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained pre- dose (0 hour), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and [ADDRESS_59822] -dose (day 1 – 3, day 
15 – 17 an d day 24 – 26). Sparse PK samples collected pre- dose and [ADDRESS_59823] -dose timepoints that coincide with dosing of study drug(s) (ie, 12, 24, 36, and 48 
hour) must be collected prior to dosing of the subject at that timepoint.  
m AEs/SAEs:  AEs/SAEs and non -serious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signs the consent form until the end of the safety reporting 
period (or until screen failure). The safety reporting period ends [ADDRESS_59824].  
n Laboratory Assessments:  Lab assessments for Cycle 1 will be performed at screening, day 1, 3, 15, 17, 24, and 26. For all subjects, laboratory assessments 
may be performed within 24 hours prior to the day on which they are required (ie, day -1, 2, 14, 16, 23, and 25) to ensure results are available for review prior 
to dosing of study drug(s) the following day. For Cycle 2+, laboratory assessments will be performed at the beginning of each cycle on day 1 and at the end of 
study. Refer to  Appendix 2  for a complete lis t of the  clinical laboratory tests to be conducted. In addition, a complete peripheral blood smear morphology 
assessment (see Blood Smear Guidance in laboratory manual) will be performed manually or automated along with routine hematol ogy testing at screen ing and 
during the study by [CONTACT_12082]. If the peripheral blood smear morphology results are abnormal and suggestive of MDS /AML or MPN, the subject will 
undergo a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy procedure. The bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy sample will then be analyzed by [CONTACT_55374] (eg, del 5q, chr 7, abn) and MPN (eg, JAK2 V617F). Additional local 
laboratory testing of genetic aberrations asso ciated with MDS/AML or MPN can be conducted using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of known 
disease genes, as necessary. If local testing is unavailable or if results are inconclusive/indeterminate, the site will be r equired to ship samples for ce ntral 
laboratory testing. If the cytogenetic testing and, if conducted, DNA sequencing by [CONTACT_55375], tazemetostat will be discontinued. See Section  12.3.7 for further details.  
o Tazemetostat Administration (QD):  During Cycle 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 800 mg tazemetostat on day 1, 15, and day 24 in the morning 
(eg, 7 – 9 am).  
p Tazemetostat Administration (multi -dose):  Subjects will receive an oral 800 mg dose of tazemetostat twice daily during Cycle 1 from da y 3 – 14 and day 17 
– 23. During subsequent cycles (Cycle 2+), dosing will begin on day 1 whereby [CONTACT_55373] 800 mg tazemetostat twice daily. Tazemetostat is to be 
taken twice daily 12 hours apart once in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) and once in the evening (eg, 7 – 9 pm).  
q Rifampin Administration (QD): During Cycle 1, subjects will receive oral 600 mg rifampin once daily from day 17 to 25 in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) one 
hour before a meal.  
r Disease Assessment:  Disease progression (PD) will be determined through Investigator assessed review of clinical status.

10.4. Study Drug Preparation  
No preparation for tazemetostat is needed. 

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59853] institutional procedures for administering an oral agent 
will be followed. An adequate supply will be provided with instructions on home administration. Tazemetostat (400 mg for Part 1 and 800 mg for Part 2) doses must be taken at least 12 hours 
apart at approximately the same time each day, for example between 7 – 9 am for the morning 
dose and 7 – [ADDRESS_59854] be one hour before a meal.  
Part 1: Tazemetostat and Itraconazole Drug Interaction  
Part 1 of the study will evaluate the drug- drug in teraction between tazemetostat and itraconazole 
in an open-label, fixed sequential cross over design ( Figure 2) .  
A screening visit will occur within 30 days of signing an informed consent form (ICF). During 
the scree
ning phase, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility to participate in the study. Subjects 
who meet the protocol criteria will be admitted in the evening to the clinical study center , or visit 
the clinic if staying locally, on day -1. Subjects may be admitted to the clinical study center for 
the entirely of Cycle [ADDRESS_59855] eligibility will be reconfirmed. On day 1, a single oral dose of 400 mg tazemetostat will be administered in the mo rning (eg, 7 – 9 am) followed by 2 days of multiple blood sampling (day 1 – 3). From day 
3 – 14, subjects will receive an oral 400 mg dose of tazemetostat twice daily (12 hours apart, once in the morning [eg, 7 – 9 am] and once in the evening [eg, 7 – 9 pm]). In the evening of day 14, subjects may be admitted to the clinical study center. On day 15, a single oral dose of 400 mg tazemetostat will be administered in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) followed by 3 days of multiple blood sampling (day 15 – 18). From day 18 – 20, a single dose of oral 200 mg itraconazole will be administered daily in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal. In the evening of day 20, subjects may be admitted to the clinical study unit. From day 21 – 35, subjects will receive an oral 400 mg dose of tazemetostat twice daily, once in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) and once in the evening (eg, 7 – 9 pm), co-administered in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal with a single dose of oral 200 mg itraconazole followed by 1 day of multiple blood sampling (day 21 – 22). In the evening of day 35, subjects may be admitted to the clinical study center. On day 36, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 400 mg tazemetostat co -administered in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 
am) after a meal with a single dose of oral 200 mg itraconazole followed by 3 days of multiple 
blood sampling (day 36 – 39). Itraconazole will also be administered on day 37 and 38 as a single oral 200 mg daily dose in the morning (eg, 7 – 9 am) after a meal. Note:  Tazemetostat will 
not be administered on day 37 and 38. After the 72-hour PK sample collection, safety assessments will be conducted on day 39. Sparse PK samples will be collected pre-dose (0 hour) and [ADDRESS_59856]-dose on day 25, 28, 31, and 34.

significant finding (eg, not noted at screening) occur s from the initial tazemetostat administration 
until the end of the study, an AE must be documented. In addition, resolution of any abnormal 
findings during the study will be noted in source document and the eCRF if clinically significant.

12.3.7. Laborato ry Assessments  
Lab assessments will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures 
(Table  3 and Table  4). Safety laboratory testing at screening and during study will be performed 
at local lab
s according to institutional procedures. Reference r anges will be supplied by [CONTACT_55387]. Abnormal laboratory values which are unexpected or not explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical condition should be repeated until confirmed, explained, or resolved. 
Laboratory value changes starting from the initial tazemetostat exposure will be recorded in the 
eCRF as an AE if clinically significant.  
In addition, a complete peripheral blood smear morphology assessment (see Blood Smear 
Guidance
 in laboratory manual) will be performed manually or automated along with routine 
hematology testing at screening and during the study by [CONTACT_12082]. If the peripheral 
blood smear morphology results are abnormal and suggestive of MDS/AML or MPN, the subject 
will undergo a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy procedure. The bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy sample 
will then be analyzed by [CONTACT_55371] (eg, del 5q, chr 7, abn) and MPN (eg, JAK2 
V617F). Additional local laboratory testing of genetic aberrations associated with MDS/AML or 
MPN can be conducted using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of known disease genes, as necessary. If local testing is unavailable or if results are inconclusive/indeterminate, the 
site will be required to ship samples for central laboratory testing.  
If the cytogenetic testing and, if conducted, DNA sequencing by [CONTACT_55388], tazemetostat will be discontinued.  
Specific clinical laboratory tests for hematology including coagulation profile, serum chemistrie
s, urinalysis, and viral serology are detailed in  Appendix [ADDRESS_59882] 2021

12.3.10. Pregnancy/ Post-Menopausal Testing  
For all FCBP, a serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening and within 24 hours (day -1) of the fi
rst dose of study drug in Cycle 1. For Cycle 2+, pregnancy testing to be performed on 
day 1 of each cycle prior to dosing of study drug. Subsequent testing at Cycle 2+ and at the end 
of study visit can be either urine or serum. Any positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed 
with a serum test. Post -menopausal females: defined as 12 months with no menses prior to 
screening and a serum FSH >40 IU/L at screening only.  
12.3.11. Pregnancy  
Ba
sed on findings from animal studies, tazemetostat may cause fetal harm when administered to 
a pregnant 
woman. There are no available data on the use of tazemetostat in pregnant and 
lactating women to inform a drug -associated risk. In rat and rabbit embryofetal development 
studies, evidence of a higher incidence of skeletal developmental abnormalities in fetuses from the pregnant animals relative to fetuses from the control animals were observed in both species, while tazemetostat -related visceral findings were noted only i n rabbits. Because there is potential 
risk for teratogenicity, tazemetostat should not be used during pregnancy or lactation.

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial 12.4. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
12.4.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administ
ered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a study drug , whether or not related to the study drug . 
Worsening of a pre- treatment ev ent, after initiation of any study drugs, must be recorded as a 
new AE. For example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dyspepsia prior to dosing of study drug, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and more frequent after the first dose of study 
drug, a new AE of severe worsening dyspepsia (with the appropriate date of onset) should be recorded in the eCRF.  
“Lack of efficacy ” or “f
 ailure of an expected pharmacological action” per se is not to be reported 
as an AE or SAE. However, any signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from “lack of efficacy ” will be reported as an AE or SAE, if they fulfill the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include: 
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to the 
procedure is
 an AE. 
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to
 a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
Anticip ated day- to-day fluc tuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected 
at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adv erse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, baseline, treatment, washout, or follow-
up), and at any dos
e of the study drug , comparator, or placebo, that fulfils one or more of the 
following:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -thr
eatening 
• NOTE: T
he term ‘ life-threateni ng’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• NOTE: In ge
neral, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] 
(usually i
nvolving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not  have been appropriate in the physician’ s 

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59890] 2021 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. 
If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the 
event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existi ng condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE. 
• Results in disability or incapacity.  
• NOTE: Th
e term disability means a substantial disruption of a person ’s ability to  
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption. 
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
• It is an i
mportant medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical
 intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such 
events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions (in subjects without pre-existing 
seizure disorder) that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Ab
 normalities 
A clinical laboratory AE is any laboratory value that is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_55390] a medical intervention or is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]. 
Laboratory abnormalities that have not required medical intervention should not be recorded as 
AEs and will be captured and reported in the laboratory section of the clinical study report 
(CSR). If a medical intervention occurs, it should be recorded as a treatment with the abnormal laboratory finding as the AE (eg, anemia with treatment required and blood transfusion recorded 
as a procedure, hyperglycemia with treatment required and change in insulin dose recorded on 
concomitant medications).  
All clinically significant lab values should be followed and recorded in the eCRF until return to 
baseline.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. O
ther Safe ty Assessment Abnormalities  
Other safety assessments (eg, ECGs, radiol ogical sc ans, vital signs measurements), including 
those that worsen from baseline and/or those considered to be clinically significant, are to be recorded as an AE or SAE, in accordance with the definitions provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], r 
espectively. 
Any other safety assessment that led to an intervention, including permanent discontinuation of study treat
ment, dose reduction, and/or dose interruption/delay is also to be recorded as an AE or 
SAE.  

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59891] 2021 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial [IP_ADDRESS]. Disease- Related Events  
Disease progression is not a SAE per se as it is an efficacy criterion. However, events that are 
associate
d with progression but are untoward (for a given patient or for the disease) and meet the 
criteria for seriousness should still be reported as SAEs.  
NOTE:  Disease progression should not be reported as an SAE event term. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Ad
ve rse Event (OAE)  
Adverse events associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error refer to 
AEs assoc
iated with uses of the study drug outside of that specified by [CONTACT_760]. Overdose, 
misuse, abuse, and medication error are defined as follows:  
• Overdose:  Accide ntal or intentional use of the study drug in an amount higher than 
the protocol-defined dose  
• Misuse:  Intenti onal and inappropriate use of study drug not in accordance with the 
protocol  
• Abuse:  Sporad ic or persistent intentional excessive use of study drug accompanied 
by [CONTACT_3584]  
• Medication error:  Any uninten tional event that causes or leads to inappropriate 
study drug use or subject harm while the study drug is in the control of site personnel 
or the subject.  
All AEs associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse,  or medica tion error should be captured on 
the AE eCRF. Both the adverse event (if any) and the dosing details should be reported using the procedures for reporting SAEs ( Section  12.7) . This process should be followed even if the there 
are no associ 
ated AE of if the associated AE does not meet serious criteria. Non -serious 
associated AE should be noted as non-serious on the SAE form and on the AE eCRF.  
12.4.2. Adverse Event s of Special Interest (AESIs)  
The following AESIs have been identified as requiring mitigation steps and monitoring to 
minimize the ris
k for the occurrence of these events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. T-Cell Lym phoblastic Lymphoma/T -Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  
Lymphoblastic lymphomas are considered thymus derived malignancies that have not yet 
completed T
-cell maturations. Approximately 90% of lymphoblastic lymphomas are the T -cell 
phenotype and typi[INVESTIGATOR_12335], accounting for 29% of pediatric and 2% of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a median age at diagnosis of 25 years (Lones, 
2007; Lai, 2013; Cortelazzo, 2017) . T-LBL is morphologically and immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_55353] 
t from T -ALL, with both diseases arising from precursor lymphoid cells of the T -cell 
lineage ( Portell, 2012; Patel, 2014 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_12337], significant yet 
unknown
 characteristics lead to differences in clinical presentations (Burkhardt, 2009) . Initial 
clinical ma
nifestation of both adult and pediatric T -LBL includes a mediastinal mass or 
lymphadenopathy with <25% bone marrow blasts. Adult T- LBL subjects tend  to have less 
thymic disease and greater lymph node disease and bone marrow involvement (Baleydier, 2008 ;

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial In the event that an AE is not covered by [CONTACT_12397], the assessment of severity  will be 
determined by [CONTACT_12398], as follows: 
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local,  or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age - appropriate 
instrumental ADL.a  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.b  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  
Abbreviations: ADL = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc  
b Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing, and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category 
used for rating the intensity of an event (as in ‘ mild’, ‘moderate’, or ‘ severe’); both AEs and 
SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is described as ‘ serious ’ when it meets one of the pre-
defined outcomes as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] which are based on patient/event outcome or 
action crit
eria associated  with events that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or functioning. 
12.5. Relatio nship to Study Drug  
A qualified Investigator must make the determination of relationship to study drug for each AE. 
The Investi
gator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_12371].  
The following should be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to study treatment: 
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the first dose o f study drug 
•
 The course of the event, considering especially the effect of discontinuation of study 
• treatment o
r the reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether
 the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other 
similar t
reatments  
• The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the event  
• T
he presence of non- study trea tment -related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event. 
Investigators must also systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the study drug 
using the 
following definitions (the decisive factor being the temporal relationship between the 
AE and administration of the study drug): 

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59898] 2021 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial • Probable:  A causal relationship is clinically/ biologically highly plausible, there is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the study 
drug, and there is a reasonable response on withdrawal. 
• Possible:  A cau sal relationship is clinically/biologically plausible and there  is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the study drug. 
• Unlikely: A causal relationship is improbable
 , and another documented cause of the 
AE is most plausible.  
• Unrelated:  A causal relat ionship can be definitively excluded,  and another 
documented cause of the AE is most plausible.  
12.6. Recording A dverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from the s
tudy personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235]. Clinically insignificant changes in laboratory values, BP, and pulse need not 
be reported as AEs. However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to discontinuation 
of administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE. Information about AEs 
will be collected from signing of the consent form until the end of the study. Serious Adverse Event information will be collected from signing of the informed consent until [ADDRESS_59899] medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, caus ality, 
action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study.  
Intensity will be assessed according to the CTCAE v5.[ADDRESS_59900] be reported and recorded on the Sponsor’s pregnancy form. Pregnancy i n i
tself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40958] a study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Study IMP will stop 
immediately for female subjects who become pregnant.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital a
bnormality) will be followed up (assuming consent) and documented even if the 
subject was discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be repo
rted and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
12.7. Reporting Adverse Events 
All AE and SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from the signing of consent form until 
the end of the safety reporting period (or until screen failure, [ADDRESS_59901]). Any SAEs considered possibly or probably related to the 
study drug  and 
discovered by [CONTACT_7201]. All SAEs must be 

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59902] complete, sign and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information 
recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy to the Sponsor.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be reported to the Sponsor. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], In
c. following the same reporting timeline as the initial report, and this should be 
completed on a follow- up SAE form and placed with the original SAE information an d kept with 
the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file. 
12.8. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_59903] promptly notify the Spons or or its designee of all SAEs in order 
that the legal obligations and ethical responsibilities of the sponsor or its designee are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory 
agencies about  the safety of the study drug  under clinical investigation. The Sponsor 
and its designee will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/EC/ CEC,  and Investigators. 
Any SAE that is unexpected (not consistent with the applicable product information) and 
considered r
elated to the study treatment by [CONTACT_737]-or the Sponsor, meets the definition 
of a S[LOCATION_003]R. S[LOCATION_003]Rs are prepared for expedited reporting according to local regulatory 
requirements and are forwarded to Investigators as necessary. The Sponsor is legally obligated to 
report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the regulatory authorities within 7 days for fatal or life -threatening events or 
15 days for all other events. 
An Investigator who receives an I nvestigato r safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will file it with the IB and 
will notify the IRB/EC/CEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
12.9. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Pregnancy will not be considered an SAE. Any report of pregnancy recorded for any female subject, or a female partner of a male subject should be reported. To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor or its designee within 2 weeks of learning of its 
occurrence using a clinical trial Pregnancy Report Form. A Pregnancy Report Form should be 
completed and submitted by [CONTACT_54769]/or fax to the Sponsor or its designee.  
The pregnant female subject must be withdrawn from the study . Every effor
 t should be made to 
gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until [ADDRESS_59904] be reported as an SAE. 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the Investigator’ s attention  after 
the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_55391], must be promptly reported to the Sponsor. 

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59905] be 
reported as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours f rom when the Investigator becomes 
aware of the event.  
12.11.  Reporting of Special Situations: Overdose, Misuse, Abuse, or 
Medication Error  
Report the special situation(s) of overdose, misuse, abuse, and/or medication error (described in 
Section  9.3.1) using one of the following sets of instructions according to whether the special 
situation oc
curred without any associated AEs, with an associated non-serious AE, or with an 
associated SAE:  
Special situation(s) without associated AE(s):  
• Report to Epi[INVESTIGATOR_55354] a paper Special Situations Form following the procedures for reporting
 SAE (Section  12.8) .   
Special situation(s) with an associated non -serious AE:  
• E
nter the non -serious  event on the AE eCRF and mark the SAE field, “ no”. SAE related 
narrative fields should not be completed. 
• Report to Epi [INVESTIGATOR_55355] g a paper Special Situations Form following the procedures for 
reporting SAE (Section  12.8) .  
Special situation(s) with an associated SAE: 
• Complete the AE eCRF per protocol for the associated SAE term ONLY (Special 
situati
ons are not adverse event terms in and of themselves); complete eCRF SAE fields.  
• Report to Epi[INVESTIGATOR_55356] a paper Special Situations Form and a paper Serious Adverse E
vent Form following the procedures for reporting SAE (Section  12.8) .

Summaries of continuous variables will present the number of subjects i ncluded in the analysis 
(N), the mean and standard deviation (SD), the median, the minimum, and the maximum 
statistics. Counts and percentages will be presented in summaries of categorical variables. The denominator for each percentage will be the number of subjects in the population unless 
otherwise specified. In general, missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise specified.  
All disposition, baseline demographics and disease characteristics will be descriptively 
summarized fo
r the Safety population  
Analyses will be done separately for each study part and overall.  
13.1. Study Design Considerations  
13.1.1. Determination of Sample Size  
A total of [ADDRESS_59907] of CYP3A4 inhibition by 
[CONTACT_55392].  
A point estimate and associated 90% confidence interval on the magnitude of the effect of the 
perpetrat
or drugs on the PK of the victim drugs will be provided. The default no effect boundary 
of 80 – 125% for the 90 % confidence interval for an effect size will be used as a reference. This 
is equivalent to a hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that there is a nonzero effect and alternative of no effect. If the 90% confidence interval for any effect tested in this study falls 
completely within 80 – 125%, it will be concluded that no significant differences are present.  
The sample size calculation is based on the underlying assumption that the within subject 
coefficie
nt of variation (CV) is 30%, a two -sided alpha lev el of 0.05, the underlying within-
subject correlation of subsequent measurements of the same PK parameter and geometric mean ratio. If the geometric mean ratio of itraconazole is 1.[ADDRESS_59908] is powered at 88% or higher.  
Calculations were performed using the Paired t- test for th
 e Equivalence of Log -Normal Means 
(Multiplicative Model) in nQuery version 8.0. 
13.2. PK analyses 
Plasma concentrations of tazemetostat and its metabolite (EPZ6930) will be determined by 
[CONTACT_55393]. Plasma concentrations of tazemetostat and its metabolite 
(EPZ6930) will be listed for each subject and summarized by [CONTACT_16051], treatment , day, and 
nominal time. Standard summary statistics will be calculated (ie, arithmetic mean, geometric 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for each endpoint.  
All PK parameters will be calculated with noncompartmental methods using actual times. The 
following PK
 parameters will be determined as data permit:  
Part 1:  Plasma AUC 0-72, Cmax, Tmax, and t ½ for tazemetostat alone on Day 15 – 18, and in the 
presence of itraconazole on Day 36 – 39.  

Clinical Study Protocol   EZH- [ADDRESS_59909] 2021 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301], Inc.  Confide n tial Part 2:  Plasma AUC 0-48, Cmax, Tmax, and t ½ for tazemetostat alone on Day 15 – 17, and in the 
presence of rifampin on Day 24 – 26. 
13.3. Safety analyses  
Safety analyses will be based on all subjects who receive at least 1 dose or partial dose of study 
drugs (Safety population). Drug exposure will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The 
severity of all adverse events is to be evaluated by [CONTACT_55394] (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 and verbatim terms will be coded to the preferred term (PT), higher level term (HLT), and system 
organ class (SOC) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version in 
use at the time of the analysis. The number and percentage of subjects with adverse events will  
be presented by [CONTACT_55366], relationship to study treatment, and severity. Clinical 
laboratory values also will be classified by [CONTACT_55395], version 5.0. 
Laboratory shift tables from baseline result to the worst post -baseline result will be provided. 
AEs will be summarized separately for: AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs 
leading to death, Grade 3, or higher AEs (per NCI CTCAE Version 5.0). Physical examination, 
vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and ECOG perfor mance status will be descriptively summarized based 
on marked abnormality criteria.  
Analyses will be done separately for each study part and overall.  
Complete details of the safety analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
13.4. Efficacy analysis  
No efficacy analysis will be performed.

Objectives:  Deficits in memory, attention, cognitive, and executive functions are the most 
common disabilities  after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Dopamine (DA) 
neurotransmission is implicated in these neural functions and dopaminergic pathways are 
recognized to be frequently disrupted after TBI.  One of the most widely used DAergic 
drugs is meth ylphenidate (Ritalin®).  Methylphenidate increases synaptic DA levels by 
[CONTACT_420572] (DAT) and blocking re -uptake. PET with 
methylphenidate challenge to measure tonic DA release provides valuable insight into the 
molecular basis of attention -deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and addiction, as well 
as practical information regarding likely effectiveness of therapy  1. The objectives of this 
study are to use PET imaging with [11C]-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, before and 
after administering  methylphenidate, to measure endogenous DA release in patients who 
are experiencing problems with cognition, attention and executive function in the chronic stage after TBI.  In addition, we will use TMS to test short intracortical inhibition, a 
gamma -amin obutyric acid receptor A ( GABA
A) - mediated phenomenon, which is under 
partial DA control, as a measure of dopaminergic activity on and off methylphenidate.   
 
Study population:  Males and females (n=30), between the ages of [ADDRESS_530559]-
concussive symptoms.  
Design :  
1. Study participants will be evaluated using brain MRI, psychometric measures  adapted 
from the TBI Common Data Elements, attention tests and information about details of the 
injury and experience of post -concussive symptoms will be recorded.  Transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS) with placebo and with methylphenidate ( 60 mg by [CONTACT_1966]) 
challenge will be performed to predict a stimulant respo nse.  
2. Subjects will be studied with [
11C]-raclopride PET in two imaging sessions.  One 
session will be after administration of  placebo and the other after methylphenidate, 60 mg 
by [CONTACT_1966].  Both placebo and methylphenidate will be given 60 minutes prior to injection 
of [11C]-raclopride to allow for peak uptake of methylpheni date in the brain .  The binding 
potential of [11C]-raclopride relative to a non -displaceable reference region  (cerebellum), 
BPND, will be used as a measure of D2/D3 receptor availabili ty.  The difference in BP ND 
between methylphenidate and placebo  (ΔBPND) is used to  measure of tonic DA release.  
3. Subjects will then be treated with oral methylphenidate , using a forced titration up to a 
dose of 30 mg given twice daily for 4  weeks.  At that point , the neuropsychologic tests 
are repeated . 
 
Outcome measures :  The primary outcome is change in information processing speed  
during neuropsychologic testing.

 1. Introduction  
 
Background/Preliminary Data: Dopaminergic pathways are recognized to be frequently disrupted after TBI.  In humans, there are three major dopaminergic fiber systems, all of which share the basic organization of cell bodies located in midline structures and long projection neurons innervating widespread cortical and subcortical regions (Fig 1).  Because of the organization of DA pathways, they are susceptible to 
shearing and rotational forces common in TBI.    
 
 
 
 
 
1. Evidence that DA pathways are damaged after TBI.   
 
There is  evidence to suggest that DA pathways are often disrupted as a result of trauma 2.  
First, patients with TBI frequently have problems with attention, concentration, 
processing speed, executive function, fatigue, and memory, functions that are recognized to involve DA pathways.  Second, brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, limbic  
structures and striatum, which are known to be rich in DA innervation, a re frequently 
injured after TBI 
3, 4.  Finally, a series of reports and small studies dating back 25 years 
indicate that neurostimulants working on the DA system are beneficial in improving cognitive and attentional deficits after TBI.  This evidence is reviewed below (Table 1) in 
more detail regarding methylphenidate, but similar data exist for amph etamine, 
amantadine, and bromocriptine (re viewed in detail by [CONTACT_420573] .) 
2.  
     Direct (but limited) evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction after TBI comes from 
SPECT studies using radioligands that bind the presynaptic DA transporter (DAT) and the DA D2 receptor (D2R).  Donnemiller et al .

TBI.  Frenette et al . 8 published a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on 
the efficacy and safety of DA agonists in TBI .  They concluded that significant clinical 
heterogeneity was observed between and within studies, which precluded any pooling of 
data. They stated that: “Considering the absence of consensus regarding clinical outcome, 
the lack of safety assessment, and the high risk of bias in the included trials, more research is warranted before DA can be recommended in TBI patients.”  
 3. Imaging of pre - and post -synaptic DA markers is useful for assessing DAergic function 
in neuropsychiatric disease, and for predicting response to therapy.    Several radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) and SPECT were recently 
developed and successfully applied to assess the integrity of presynaptic DA neurons and postsynaptic DA receptors in humans. Of these, [
11C]-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand 
whose specific binding is sensitive to competition by [CONTACT_231431], has been extensively  
 
 
used to indir ectly assess DA release ( Fig. 2) 1, 9-11.  This technique was  used to identify 
deficits in DA circuitry in ADHD and addiction disorders, but was never used to assess 
cognitive and behavioral deficits  after TBI. [CONTACT_420643]  has pi[INVESTIGATOR_420541] [ADDRESS_530565] of dopamine release

correlation between intravenous 
MP-induced changes in DA D2/D3 
receptor availability in ventral

long-term MP treatment) and the 
improved scores of symptoms of  
inattention (CAARS A).  (From 
Volkow et al 2012)  [ADDRESS_530566], executive function and addiction 13, 14.  Functional MRI (fMRI) in the 
resting state can identify functional brain networks such as the default mode network 
(DMN) which underlie complex behaviors such as cognitive control, salience processing, and reward -related brain activity. Recently, the fun ctional connectivity of the 
orbitofrontal cortex in the DMN was associated with D3 recept or availability in the 
midbrain 
15.  This observation provides the rationale for our proposal to investigate 
resting state functional network s, and to explore any changes in functional connectivity 
of the PFC as a result of methylphenidate therapy.  The ability to assess the integrity of 
DAergic circuits with fMRI would have major clinical implications, since fMRI is a 
much more widely available technology compared to [11C]-raclopride PET.     
 5.  Transcranial magnetic s timulation (TMS) of motor cortex as a biomarker of integrity 
of DA circuits.    The motor cortex (M1) receives direct dopaminergic input  
16 which inhibits corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_420542]  17. The response of the motor cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation 
(TMS) is affected by [CONTACT_420576]  [ADDRESS_530567] of methylphenidate and 
the specific NE reuptake inhibitor, atomoxetine , on the same measures in ADHD, where 
decreased M1 inhibition correlates with symptom severity  20, 21, suggesting deficient DA 
input.  These medications both produced an increase in inhibition similar to that seen with DA agonists. We propose using the same TMS paradigm to m easure M1 inhibition 
before  and after administration of methylphenidate.  Our expectation is that patients who 
respond to treatment  behaviorally and with greater [
11C]-raclopride displacement on PET 
will show a greater increase in M1 inhibition  on methylphenidate  than those who do not.  
Ideally, TMS might be used to  predict stimulant response. 
 5.  Behavioral effect of methylphenidate on motivation and rewardability in TBI.  Fatigue and loss of motivation are frequently observed after TBI  
22, 23, but are difficult to 
quantitate . This problem has been attributed to dysfunction in the dopaminergic reward 
system and there is a presumption that dopaminergic treatment can restore this function.  We have designed and tested a qu antitative way to measure the willingness of individuals 
to perform muscular contractions for  different  reward  values  and propose to use it here, 
on and off methylphenidate, as an exploratory measure of motivation and rewardability.   
 This study is sponsor ed by [CONTACT_420577] 
(CNRM). To address the profound issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of TBI, the [LOCATION_002] Congress, through Public Law 110- 252, established the Center for 
Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) as a collaborative intramural program in May 2008.  The Congressional Record of May 15, 2008, expressed Congressional intent that the CNRM study actual combat casualties cared for at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) and the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) using advanced neuroimaging technology in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

2. Study objectives  
 
Primary Objective:    
 
To assess the relationship between tonic DA release (assessed by [CONTACT_420578] [11C]

 (1). Assess  the relationship between D2/D3 receptor availability in the VS and PFC  with 
neuropsychological deficits in the chronic stage after TBI. (2). Assess the relationship between tonic DA release in the VS and PFC with 
neuropsychological deficits after TBI.  
(3). Determine  the relationship between D2/D3 receptor availability and functional 
connectivity of the PFC with nodes of the default mode network.   (4). Assess the relationship between TMS -induced short -interval cortical inhibition 
(SICI) of M1 and tonic DA release, as  well as response to methylphenidate therapy . 
(5).   To test  motivation and reward on and off methylphenidate in TBI patients. 
 Exploratory Objectives:  
(6).  Use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to explore  the relationship between structural 
connectivity between the VS, PFC, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) , and tonic DA 
release in patients in the chronic stage after TBI .

performed after administration of placebo or oral methylphenidate to measure endogenous DA release in TBI patients.  Structural MRI  will be performed before 
methylphenidate administration. TMS  after placebo or methylphenidate will be 
performed to measure intracortical inhibition and dopaminergic activity. Neuropsychological tests will be performed before and after methylphenidate administration for 4 weeks.  The participants will be individuals, who are experiencing chronic problems with fatigue, cognition, attention, and executive function after TBI.  
 
Site location:  NIH Clinical Center.  
 Length of participation in the study :  Participants enrolled in the study will have four 
outpatient st udy visits durin g an approximate  [ADDRESS_530569] from three 
to five hours. The study include s a diagnostic phase and an  interventional phase and 
consists of   three diagnostic  visits and one follow up visit.

  4.2 Recruitment  
 
Source of subjects and recruitment venues :  Study participants will be recruited from 
Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, National Intrepid Center of Excellence, 
Ft. Belvoir Community Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center in 
Richmond, Virginia, other area Veterans Administration clinics, the NIH, and CNRM’s Facebook website (Appendix C)  and Twitter  page  (Appendix A).  
They also may be recruited from among volunteers who participated in other CNRM studies who signed consent and indicated that they would like to be contact[CONTACT_420581].  How potential sub jects will be approached : Recruitment materials may be  distributed 
at educational presentations. The IRB -approved brochure (Appendix C) will be 
distributed with the permission of the clinics’ administration or IRB where applicable. Same recruitment brochure will be used as Facebook advertisement (Appendix C).   
One of the investigators or study coordinator named in the protocol may contact [CONTACT_420582].  Investigators from other CNRM studies in which volunteers consent to be contact[CONTACT_420583].  The study telephone number is on the front of the brochure and will be 
advertised on the CNRM website and twitter page.  We will also employ the NIH Clinical Center and the CNRM Recruitment Core resources.  They may refer patients who call the centers inquiring about TBI studies to our central study number. Otherwise it will be up 
to the participant to call the study number. Self- referral is also permitted.   
  Accrual Rate:  We plan to enroll 30 participants over a 2 -year period.   
Pre-screening questions for recruiters:  Pre-screening will be performed by [CONTACT_20234], investigators, and research assistants over the telephone or in-person. If the  
potential subject is unfamiliar with the details of the study and time requirements, the prescreener will use the pre- screening Script (Appendix D) along with the Eligibility 
Checklist to determine preliminary eligibility." The members of the research team who will be qualified to administer the Eligibility Checklist will have to complete a Good Clinical Practice course and the class, “Elements 
of a Successful Consent” offered by [CONTACT_420584].   If the potential participant  expresses interest in the study, the person doing the  pre- 
screening will ask if they have time to answer a short questionnaire that would allow him/her to evaluate their eligibility and safety for inclusion into the study (Eligibility checklist, Appendix F).  If based on this interaction, it appears that the subject might meet the inclusion criteria for the study, an appointment will be scheduled for the patient to come to NIH.  To prepare for this visit, the potential participant will be asked for his/her full name (first and last), address, telephone number, and date of birth to be entered into the Admissions and Travel and Vouchers program.   
  
17 
  
Research staff may ask for medical records (recent history, medication list, recent imaging and pertinent records related to the subject’s recent injury) to further evaluate their eligibility for the study. The subjects may bring their own medical records when they come to NIH for testing. The data may be reviewed by [CONTACT_420585], and if it is clear that the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria, we will contact [CONTACT_420586].  Data obtained in this manner may be used to refine our inclusion and exclusion criteria; however, it will not be used for any research purposes. We will send their medical records back to them if they do not meet 
criteria.   
 Identifying information will be destroyed within one week of learning about a potential participant’s pre- screening failure.  
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_530570] will undergo the following procedures:  1) Informed Consent:  One of the physician investigators will obtain consent before any research and screening procedures are conducted. The consent is written in language appropriate for the subject to comprehend. The study physician will discuss the study 
with the potential participant, review all parts of the consent form, answer questions about the study, give a copy of the consent form to the participant and ask them to review it, consider it, ask questions, and discuss it with friends or family.  If the participant decides to sign the form, a copy will be given to them to take home.  The study coordinator or research assistant may assist the physician in reviewing the consent form in detail and in collecting information from the patient in order to complete the case report forms.  
 2)  Screening by [CONTACT_420587] a Clinical Center requirement, an NIH staff nurse will take vital signs including pulse, temperature, blood pressure, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. The nurse may record a list of the 
participant’s current medications and a brief medical history. One of the study physicians will do a history and physical exam, including a neurological exam which will be e ntered 
into CRIS.   
  
18 
   
Screening includes:  
 
a.  Medical history including information about the traumatic brain injury  
b.    Interview with the study physician  
        c.    Urine pregnancy test if applicable.  
        d.    Physician’s determination of participant eligibility for the study  
 
Determination of Subject Eligibility:  Subject’s eligibility for the study will be 
documented using the Eligibility Checklist, which is based on the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria.  The checklist should be reviewed with each potential participant prior to the 
subject’s initial visit. Final determination of eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_263814], using the patient’s medical records, medical history, and in-person interview. Medical history including history of TBI will be collected from all subjects to assist the physician in eligibility determination. If medical records are unavailable, data such as time of injury, loss of consciousness, and post traumatic amnesia, are to be summarized f rom interviews with the subject.  
  Urine Pregnancy Test :  If applicable, the study participant will provide a urine 
pregnancy test required for screening women able to become pregnant , unless they have 
had a surgical procedure permanently preventing pregnancy.  This is  part of the 
eligibility requirement.  
 Enrolled or screen failed:  If the patient is deemed eligible by [CONTACT_093], then 
she/he will begin the study procedures. If the patient is not eligible, she/he will be considered a screen failure and will not go through study procedures.  Signed consent forms for screen failures will be maintained with study records in [CONTACT_420644]’s research office. The research records will be kept in locked cabinets and the office will be locked when not in use. Their contact [CONTACT_420588].   Volunteers who fail the enrollment criteria for this study will be co nsidered screening 
failures.  Screening failures will be counted separately than those that drop out for other reasons.  Subjects who come into the Clin ical Center will sign a consent form before 
engaging in any study procedures. If they do not meet eligibility for the study, even though they have signed a consent form, they will be considered screening failures. Once a participant has met eligibility criteria and engaged in a study procedure and chooses not to participate in the protocol, are lost to follow -up, or voluntarily withdraw 
or are involuntarily withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_093], they will be counted as drop- outs for statistical purpo ses.  
 Contraception:  Sexually active women who are able to become pregnant must agree to use an effective method of contraception (birth control) from the time they enroll in the study until [ADDRESS_530571] completed taking the study drug, methylphenidate.

 4.4 Study  Procedures  
Infor med consent  will be obtained before any study procedures. All evaluations and 
procedures are done  only for research purposes.  Table 2 is a schedule of procedures for 
each study visit.  While the stated target time points and assessment batteries will be 
attempted for subjects in this study, it is anticipated that some subjects will not be able to 
undergo all tests at all times and may refuse assessments. Procedures may be done in a different order after consent and de termination of eligibility depending on Imaging 
Center, Phlebotomy Center, and neuropsychometrician’s schedules and availability.

 Incidental findings on brain imaging, laboratory evaluation or physical examination: The physician will inform the patient ab out any finding that may require further 
evaluation or care. Evaluation or treatments of these conditions are  not provided at NIH. 
If needed, the study physician will refer the patient to a health care provider. The study team may not inform the patient ab out minor abnormalities that do not have importance 
for their health or well-being.     
4.4.2 Biospecimen Sample Collection  
 
  a. U rine sample:  Prior to MRI or PET  scanning  or TMS , urine specimens will be 
collected from women able to become pregnant  for pregnancy tests. A urine pregnancy 
test must be  done within [ADDRESS_530574] e: Venous blood samples will be collected from study participants by a 
trained phlebotomist or nurse at the Clinical Ce nter during V isits #1 and #4.  Blood 
samples will be drawn  for research purposes .  
 For research purpose s during this study, approximately 25 ml (approximately 5  
teaspoons) of blood will be collected from participants at V isits #1 and #4 . A total of 50 
ml (approx imately 11  teaspoons) will be collected  over the 4 weeks of the study. 
No specific genetic tests will be performed under this protocol because the sample size of this study is not sufficient to perform these studies. Since t he sample size of this study is 
relatively small, it is not possible to determine the type of genetic p olymorphism which 
will be analyzed in the future. The specimens will be transferred to the CNRM Biorepository and will be combined with similar type s of samples for future studies.  
 
  
21 
 Results of genetic testing obtained at NIH are often preliminary and difficult to interpret 
because the testing is being done for research purposes only and the laboratories are not CLIA -certified.  Results will not be shared with participants, their families, or insurance 
companies.  
 
4.4.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
  
1.  All women able to become pregnant  will provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test 
performed no more than 24 hours before MRI. Women who are discovered to be 
pregnant on their follow -up visit  #4 will not participate in the imaging portion of this 
study.  2.  The research coordinator or assistant will escort the participant to the Tesla MR System in the CNRM Neuroimaging Core, housed at the NIH Clinical Center and will monitor the participant throughout the procedure.   3.  Subjects will be screened for MRI safety using the Screening Questionnaire used by [CONTACT_420590] (Appendix F). Final approval to continue with study MRI procedures will be the responsibility of study investigators.  4. Subjects may be a sked to lie still for up to [ADDRESS_530575] .  They are 
not required to do any tasks during the structural MRI.  Sequences used for the structural MRI include T1 Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE),  Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), resting state functional connectivity (rfMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) to assess resting CBF, gradient echo (GRE) and/or T2* susceptibility 
weighted imaging (SWI).  If the image quality of a given sequence is inadequate due to 
patient motion for example, these may be repeated at the discretion of the MRI technologist or radiologist. The structural scan takes approximately [ADDRESS_530576] . Volkow in cocaine addiction participants showed that s hort-
term methylphenidate administration within 2 hours reduced an abnormally strong 
connectivity of the ventral striatum with the dorsal striatum (putamen/ globus pallidus) , 
suggesting that methylphenidate c an remodel abnormal circuitry  
24. Therefore, one month 
will be a sufficient interval between tw o fMRI scans to study functional connectivity 
after methylphenidate administration .  
For this purpose an fMRI scan is obtained while subjects rest with their eyes open in the scanner without any stimulation. A n echo -planar imaging (EPI) time series (TE/TR: 
20/1600 ms, 200 kHz bandwidth, 64 ×  64 matrix size, 20 ×  20-cm
2 field-of-view, 35 
coronal slices, 4 -mm thickness, 1- mm gap, 187 time points, scan time) will be acquired. 
RFC will take approximately [ADDRESS_530577].  We anticipate that the core phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_420545] 1 hour to complete.  These 
assessments will be  done on diagnostic visit #2 and follow up visit  # 4.  Baseline 
assessment can be done on visit #1.  Subjects will be given frequent rest breaks.  The subject may refuse to answer any question or to stop a test at any time and for any reason.  TBI phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_420546] (CDEs).  The subject 
will be interviewed, complete questionnaires, take pen -and-paper tests, and perform 
simple a ctions. 
   In this study , we will include the following selected subset of assessments taken from the 
CDE’s:  
1. Glasgow Outcome Scale- Extended (GOS -E): is an assessment of the 
general functioning.  This scale evaluates 8 categories: Dead, Vegetative State, Lo wer Severe Disability, Upper Severe Disability, Lower Moderate 
Disability, Upper Moderate Disability, Lower Good Recovery, and Upper Good Recovery (10 min).   
2. Learning trials portion of the [LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test (CVLT -II): 
measures long and short  delay free and cued recall , the  effects of 
interference, recognition, and efficiency of learning (5 min). 
3. The Trail Making Tests A and B (TMT):  visual conceptual and visual motor tracking motor speed and attention The test requires visual scanning, numer ic sequencing and visual motor speed  (5 min ). 
4. Subsets of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS -IV) (Digit 
Symbol and Symbol Search): perceptual organization and processing speed (10 min). 
5. Brief Symptom Inventory 18 ( BSI-18) is used to identify self -reported 
clinically relevant psychological symptoms in adolescents and adults.  The shortened form of the BSI instrument provides a highly sensitive assessment of  psychological factors (10 min). 
6. Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS): is a short 5 -item instrument designed 
to measure global cognitive judgments of satisfaction with one's life  (1 
min) .  
7. Word Reading subtest of Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) -4: 
measures the basic academic skills of reading, spellin g, and math 
computation (15 min). 
  
[ADDRESS_530578] -Concussion Symptom Questionnaire: rate the severity of 
16 different symptoms commonly found after a TBI (5 min). 
 
The attention tasks chosen according to Whyte (6) will be administer ed twice 
(approximately 60 min).  A neuropsychometrist or neuropsychologist will administer these tests to participants in a 
private room. Some of the tests are pencil/paper tests; others are computer tests; and some will be verbal question and answer tests. The participant may take breaks. These assessments will be pe rformed twice.  
 The tests used for measurement of various aspects of attention are shown below:  
 
1. Continuous Performance Test The Conners Continuous Performance Test 3rd Edition™ (Conners CPT 3™) is a task-oriented computeriz ed assessment of attention -related problems in individuals aged 8 
years and older. By [CONTACT_420591]’s performance in areas of inattentiveness, impulsivity, sustained attention, and vigilance, the Conners CPT 3 can be useful to the process of diagnosing Attention- Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) and other 
neurological conditions related to attention. Administration time: [ADDRESS_530579] (HRNB) . This is a test which requires the subject to attend to two 
rhythms which are played one after the other and determine if they are the same or different.  This test assesses auditory attention.   Administration time: [ADDRESS_530580] The Flanker task measures both a participant’s attention and inhibitory control. The test requires the participant to focus on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli  
(fish for ages 3 -7 or arrows for ages 8 -85) flanking it. Sometimes the middle stimulus is 
pointing in the same direction as the “flankers” (congruent) and sometimes in the opposite direction (incongruent). Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and  
reaction time, and the test takes approximately [ADDRESS_530581] is recommended for ages 3-85. Administration time: [ADDRESS_530582] psychometric tool in the TBI field, and is being used in two large recently launched multicenter studies (Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK -TBI) and Chronic 
Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC)).  It has been adapted in academic medical 
centers, VA, and Military Treatment F acilities.    
The NIH Toolbox was developed by [CONTACT_420592] 
  
24 
 site (http://assessmentcenter.net).  Investigators set up a password- protected accou nt with 
the Assessment Center, which is specific for each study.  Access to the study -specific 
website is only available to study personnel who are provided with a username [CONTACT_420638] [CONTACT_079] (PI). Testing is carried out through the  website. 
Participant files can include only a study number, age, and gender.  We will upload no protected health information to the Assessment Center website.  The software program administers the test and provides the scores, which are further normalized for age and 
gender.   
The assessment instruments reside on Northwestern University’s server and are only accessible through the secure Assessment Center website.  Assessments which have been administered remain on the Northwestern server and are available for use by [CONTACT_420593].  The Assessment Center staff does not look at 
the data for quality control purposes or any other purposes.   
For this study, we will use the NIH Toolbox tests (Flanker Inhibitory Control and 
Attention Test and the Patte rn Comparison Processing Speed Test)  as it has become the 
standard in the field, and particularly appropriate for measuring Processing Speed, using computerized assessment tools.  No PHI will be entered into the Assessment Center 
website.   
 
4. Processing  speed  
 Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test This test measures speed of processing by [CONTACT_327272]- by-side pi[INVESTIGATOR_327234]. Participants’ raw score is the number of items 
correct in a [ADDRESS_530583] is recommended for ages 7-85.  Administration time: 4 minutes .  
 Total Administration time for the attention  battery is 32 minutes.  
 The tests to be used to identify processing speed are the WAIS -IV Processing Speed 
Index (PSI) and the NIH Tool Box, Processing Speed (Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test).  The PSI is a TBI CDE and Pattern comparison is an NIH Tool Box component.   Both of these tests yield demographically adjusted standard scores with a mean of [ADDRESS_530584] Ed.(CPT 3), the SeaShore Rhythm Test (SSRT) from the HRNB and the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test from the NIH tool box.  The results from the CPT 3 
  
25 
 and the SSRT are reported as demographically adjusted T -scores (mean of 50 and SD or 
10).  While the NIH tool box reports scores in standard score format (mean of 100 and 
SD of 15).  In addition the CPT [ADDRESS_530585] than processing speed it is recommended that the various scores are all used independently to examine if the treatment differentially affects various aspects of attention.  Thus a unified score is not recommended for this cognitive domain.    
4.4.5. TMS  (measurement of  intracortical inhibition ) 
 
The TMS procedure will be performed before and 60 minutes after methylphen idate (60 
mg by [CONTACT_1966])  administration .  EMG electrodes will be applied to the optimum position 
for recording the MEP response from the abductor pollicis brevis or first dorsal 
interosseous muscle. TMS will be  delivered through a round coil at the optimal position 
for producing an MEP in the target muscle. Resting and active motor threshold (RMT 
and AMT) will be measured  after oral methylph enidate.  Then, short -interval cortical 
inhibition (SICI) will be measured with a conditioning pulse just before the test pulse.  
Twenty trials  at each interval and [ADDRESS_530586] pulses will be delivered in 
random order.    TMS with out and with oral methylphenidate will be performed on V isit #2. Tests with 
placebo or methylphenidate can be also administered separately  at visits #1 #2 or # 3.  
TMS with placebo and with methylphenidate requires [ADDRESS_530587]  task  (motivation test)  
 This experimental task  measures the subject’s preference for making hard and easy 
efforts (muscle contractions)  under differentially  rewarded conditions.  We consider the 
willingness to perform a given effort for a given reward values  a measure of motivation 
and rewardability.    In this task, visual feedback  showing the degree of muscle activation is given to subjects 
as they make a contraction with the left hand ; the EMG is recorded continuously with 
surface electrodes.  During each trial , two targets appear on a feedback display, 
corresponding to 20% and 60% of the individual’s maximum voluntary contraction.  Each target is  randomly assigned a monetary reward value: One target is labeled ‘$0.75’ 
and the other is labeled with a value ranging from $0.75 to $1.25, chosen from a random distribution of $0.75 – x  with mean of x = 0 (i.e., the mean difference between the target 
values is $0 across trials).  Subjects are asked to choose which monetary value they 
would like to earn by [CONTACT_7328] a contraction to bring the feedback bar to the corresponding target.  Rewards are given intermittently, such that in  half the trials (randomly assigned) , 
the subject receives the chosen value and for the other half,  they receive no money.  
  For each trial, the stimulus screen and the subject has up to [ADDRESS_530588] be held for 1.5s for the response to be 
  
26 
 registered.  As soon as a response is entered, the stimulus disappears.  The next scre en 
either reads, “You won $X.xx [the chosen value]” or “Sorry, no prize”.  Finally, after 2s, 
a fixation cross appears for 6s.    In previous exper iments in healthy subjects, we found a consistent preference for the 
lower effort and that the effort intensi ty choice is a function of the difference in reward 
values  associated  with the 20% and 60% contractions.  The probability of choosing the 
high effort at a given difference in reward values approximates a logistic function, which we would expect to shift to the left (higher likelihood of choosing high effort for a given 
difference in reward) when motivation and rewardability are higher. This study will be 
performed on Visit #2. Experiments can be performed on separate days. Part of the test 
can be also admin istered on visits #1 or #3 and requires 40 min. 
 4.4.7 Study Medication  
 Participants will take methylphenidate (Ritalin) , which is FDA -approved and used most 
often in children to treat  attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) .  
Methylphenidate is a drug acting on DA neurotransmission commonly used off label by [CONTACT_420574]. It acts by [CONTACT_420594] , as well as blocking catecholamine reuptake. In this study , the drug 
will be taken in a therapeutic dose which significantly increased extracellular DA in the 
brain  
11.  Duration of treatment is chosen bas ed  on a prior randomized controlled trial of  
oral methylphenidate in patients with chronic deficits after TBI,  which demonstrated 
increased processing speed after 3 weeks of oral administration  of methylphenidate 6. The 
dosage of methylphenidate 60 mg/day was given to moderate to severe TBI patients in this study . In this study the participants received methylphenidate in double blind, 
placebo -controlled study in dosage 0.3 mg/kg twice a day, with a range 15- 40 mg twice a 
day (30 mg twice a day mg per day per 100 kg body weight) for [ADDRESS_530589] recei ving methylphenidate 
withdrew (due to possible exacerbation of baseline hypertension). This study provides evidence that dosage of 60 mg/ day is safe in TBI participants.    The participants will receive oral methylphenidate 60 mg before the second TMS stu dy 
during V isit #2. The participants will receive oral methylphenidate 60 mg before the 
second PET scan during V isit #3. This single dose is chosen bas ed on evidence of 
increased intracellular DA after oral dose of methylphenidate 
11. Single dose of [ADDRESS_530590] study the researchers used PET with [ 11C]raclopride (D2 receptor ligand that competes with endogenous DA for binding to the receptor) to evaluate if oral  60 mg 
methylphenidate changes extracellular DA in 11 healthy controls. The study showed that oral  60 mg methylphenidate significantly increased extracellular DA in brain, as evidenced by  a significant reduction in Bmax/Kd (measure of D2 receptor availability) in 
striatum (20 ±12%; p <0.0005). These results provide evidence that oral methylphenidate at dose 60 mg significantly increases extracellular DA in human brain. No adverse events were reported (The Journal of Neuroscience, 2001, Vol. 21 RC121).  Another study by 
  
[ADDRESS_530591]. Volkow group showed that oral methylphenidate produced dose dependent blockage 
of dopamine transporter (measured by [CONTACT_420595] 11 cocaine) and the dose [ADDRESS_530592], up to 74 % blockage of dopamine transporters. No adverse events 
after 60 mg administration of methylphenidate were reported on healthy volunteers (Am J Psychiatry 1998; 155:1325–1331). The purpose of this part the study is to measure tonic DA release, which will be evaluated by [CONTACT_420596] 
(relative to non- displaceable reference region after placebo and methylphenidate 
administration). In order to be able to show the difference with placebo administration, the highest dosage which shown to be safe and effective (60 mg) in the cited studies will 
be used in our study.  The participants will receive the  study medication during V isit #3.   
The maximal dose of methylphenidate in this study will be  30 mg orally twice daily, the 
dosage was chosen according to Whyte et al. 
6. “Dose titration will be incremental within 
6 days (dose -escalation phase), starting at 5 mg orally twice daily for 2 days, and 10 mg 
twice daily for the next 2 days and then 20 mg twice daily for next 2 days”. Then the dose 
will be increased to 30 mg twice daily  starting from day 7  (Table 3).

the minimal dose 5 mg/day.   
 
 If participants do not experience adverse events, they will continue with this dose for  the 
remaining 3 weeks  of the study  (stable phase) . The participants will have two telephone 
follow ups during stable  dosing.  
 The target duration of intake of the medication in the stable  phase is 3 weeks.  In this 
study all visits can be scheduled within 2 weeks from the target date.  In order to provide sufficient medication for 3 weeks ’ treatment and 2 additional weeks for scheduling, t he 
  
29 
 patients will receive study medication for 5 weeks . The remain ing pi[INVESTIGATOR_420547] V isit #4 to evalua te compliance. The leftover drug will be 
destroyed through NIH CC pharmacy once a research participant completed all 
procedures, returned unused drugs, and all the data is recorded.   
  
4.4.8 PET Scanning and processing  
 
Scans will be performed with the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) which has a transverse resolution of about 2.[ADDRESS_530595] ’s head. It is used to monitor head position and movement during the scan; the 
information is used in the PET image reconstruction process to reduce any blurring of the PET images. Subjects will be positioned in the scanner with the brain in the field of view. Prior to the [
11C]raclopride administration, a transmission scan will be obtained with a 
rotating 137Cs source for attenuation correctio n. Subsequently, approximately 20 mCi of 
the [11C]raclopride will be injected through an intravenous catheter in an arm vein over 
about [ADDRESS_530596] ® pump and a 90- min dynamic scan will be obtained.  
 The PET imaging data from the placebo day will be used as a measure of baseline raclopride binding potential, calculated using the Simplified Reference Tissue Model . 
PET measurements taken following methylphenidate administration will be compared to those derived after placebo administration. This will permit measurement of the reduction in specific binding of raclopride due to competition with DA endogenously released by [CONTACT_420597] (10). The percent change from baseline was  proportional 
to the magnitude of DA rele ase.  
 Oral methylphenidate in a 60- mg dose or a placebo will be administered and th e scan will 
be done 60 min later , according to the schedule used by  [CONTACT_304092]. (11). The oral 
placebo will be administered before the first PET scan  and the methylphenidate  will be 
administered before the second one . The subjects will be blind as  to whether placebo or 
oral methylpheni date is administered. They will have about a 2-hr break between the PET 
scans, or PET scans can be performed on separate days. The participants  will have two 
90-min PET  scans  with [
11C]-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand 11.  
 Total PET scan time will be [ADDRESS_530597] 2 hrs. PET will be done 
on visit #3. PET with placebo and with methylphenidate can be done on separate days, on visit # 1 or visit #2.    The radionuclide (C11) half -life is [ADDRESS_530598] injection of raclopride to second 
injection 150 min, which time less than 0.75% of the 1st raclopride dose will be left.   Regions of interest (ROIs) are obtained directly from coregistered [
11C]-raclopride scans 
and structural MRIs as described previously.(1)  ROIs are identified for the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum (VS), and prefrontal cortex  (PFC) using multiple planes.  
  
30 
 D2/D3 receptor availability was measured as the binding potential relative to a 
nondisplaceable refer ence (BP ND), the ratio of the distribution volume in each ROI to that 
in cerebellum minus 1.  The difference in BP ND (∆BPND) between  MP and placebo was 
used as the measure of DA release.    
 Findings from the ROI analysis will be confirmed and extended using Voxel -Based 
Analysis and Statistical Parametric Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (SPM).(1)  SPM will also be used in exploratory analysis to assess the effect of MP on DA release in extrastriatal brain regions.  SPM analysis will be performed on BP
ND images (obtained by [CONTACT_420598][INVESTIGATOR_8070]).  A spatial normalization template matching the average BP ND 
image contrast in the brain was developed using the BP ND images from 20  healthy age-
matched controls who participated in prior [11C]-raclopride studies done by [CONTACT_6283]. Volkow 
and Hers covitch using the same instrument and scanning sequence.  A 12- parameter 
affine transformation with 16 nonlinear iterations will be used to register the images to the MNI template provided with the SPM package.   
 
 4.4.9 Summary of the study procedures   
 
Missed visits will be rescheduled within 2 weeks of the target date whenever possible.  
Study physicians may ask the patient to come in for an examination between visits if the patient has persistent side effects.  Investigators may refer the patients to their personal physicians to treat adverse side effects or for negative symptoms relating to the TBI.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Diagnostic Visit  #1:  
 During Visit #1, participant s will see a stu dy physician for examination and medical 
history. (30 min), will have blood collect ed (15 min), and urine samples will be taken 
from women  able to become pregnant . Participants will have structural MRI ( 45 min), 
and Res ting Functional Connectivity (15 min). Visit #1 requires approximately 2 hr 50 
min in total.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnostic Visit  #2: 
 
During Visit #2, urine pregnancy test will be repeated on the same day for women able to become pregnant . Participants have neuropsychological tests (60 min) , attention tests (60 
min) and TMS with motivation tasks without and w ith methylphenidate challenge (2  hr 
40 min), adverse events will be monitored (15 min).   Visit # 2 can be performed within two week s of V isit #1.    Neuropsychological tests (60 
min) and attention tests (60 min)  can be performed during Visit #1. Visit #2 requires 
approximately 5 hours in total.

4.4.9.3Diagnostic Visit # 3 : 
 
At Visit #3, women able to become pregnant  will have urine pregnancy test,  [11C]-
raclopride PET scan s after placebo  and after  oral meth ylphenidate will be performed (4  
hr). T he study drug will be dis pensed to participants (5 min) and adverse events will be 
monitored (15 min). Visit #3 requires approximately 4 hr 25  min of research time in total.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Telephone follow -ups: 
 
All participants will be contact[CONTACT_426] a research assistant or study coordina tor by 
[CONTACT_420599].   
 
1. The participants will have a telephone follow -up to evaluate adverse eve nts 
during dose -escalation part of interventional phase  of the study ( 1-6 days 
after initiation of methylphenidate administration).  
2. The first telephone follow up at the stable part  of interventional phase  of 
the study will be done 7- [ADDRESS_530599] common side effects.  If the participant reports any bothersome side effects, the research assistant or coordinator will inform one of the physician i nvestigators who will follow -up by [CONTACT_420600]-
person with the participant.  Instructions for following medication intake will be given, as described in 4.4.7.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow- up visit  # 4:   
 
At Visit #4, participant s will see a study physician (15 min) , have about 5 teaspoons of 
blood collected (15 min), have neuropsychological testing (2 hr). Women able to become 
pregnant will have urine pregnancy test. Participants  will have an MRI scan for restin g 
functional connectivity (15 min) and will be monitored for adverse effects (15 min).  T he 
MRI and neuropsychological testing tests will be done while patients are under the 
effects of their medication (methylphenidate taken 1 -3 hr before).  Patients will return 
unused study medication (20 min).  
 Total time for research  procedures during V isit #4 is approximately 3 hr 10 min.  The 
time will vary depending on how long it takes the patient to complete the neurocognitive testing if schedules are not running on time.

 4.5. End of Participation   
 
Participation will end upon completion of Visit #4 , unless there is an adverse event that 
needs to be resolved . Participants remain under the care of their own health care 
providers during study participation and after the end of participation.     
 4.5.1 Communication of Incidental Findings  
 
MRI:  A radiologist will officially read all MRI exams. Professional fees associated with research MRIs will be paid for by [CONTACT_420601]’ insurance. All imaging data that are germane to clinical interpretation will be interpreted by a credentialed neuroradiologist. Clinically relevant findings will be reviewed by [CONTACT_420602], in the context of the entire medical assessment, appropriate treatment and or follow -up will be recommended to the 
participant as indicated.  Unexpected findings on brain imaging that require clinical intervention may occur.  Therefore, any research findings on brain images, laboratory or other evaluation that may require further evaluation or impact the subject’s medical care  
will be shared with subjects and their health care providers by a physician investigator.  However, this study does not provide treatment and does not replace any therapy that a subject may be receiving as part of standard medical care for TBI.  
 The study physician/ investigator may share some of the results from the MRI and general 
feedback from the neuropsychological testing on the patient’s strengths and areas of difficulty.  There are no psychiatric tests in this battery.  Ther e is one checklist for 
depression.  If any question about suicidal ideation is answered in the affirmative, the study physician will talk with the patient and call in the CNRM p sychiatrist, [CONTACT_420645] 
or an NIH staff psychiatrist if there is a concern abo ut the patient’s stability and safety.  
NIH policy will be followed concerning a patient who may be a danger to himself.   Blood:  Blood samples are used for research purposes only.    
5.  Storage of Data and Samples

(Adjunct PI) laboratory at CNRM.  Any samples not immediately analyzed by [CONTACT_22888]-
investigator, [CONTACT_409662] -Arrastia, will be stored in the CNRM Biorepository. B iospecimens 
and data provided to the CNRM Repository, which is operated under USUHS Protocol No. CNRM -004 “Biorepository and Informatics Warehousing”, with [CONTACT_314506] M. Cox as 
PI, will be coded using a Global Unique Identifier (GUID).  Access to specimens maintained by [CONTACT_420603]. Cox.  An MTA is under negotiation between NINDS and DOD regarding the blood samples and data collected at NIH and stored at the CNRM Biorepository. Biorepository protocol (see

research program of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), and DOD is the custodian of the samples. The Uniformed Services University operates the CNRM and the USU IRB reviews the repository for patient protection and receives reports from a Biorepository Steering Committee on the operations of the repository. 
  
[CONTACT_420646] ssermann is responsible for samples  at the NIH and until they are received at 
the CNRM Biorepository. Before sending blood samples, we will remove the subject’s name [CONTACT_420640]; we will assign them a code. The key to the code will be kept in a separate, secure area. Once the coded samples arrive at the CNRM 
Biorepository, a repository manager will be responsible for maintaining the samples and sending them to others who may use the samples for research. Subject’s blood samples will only be accessible  by [CONTACT_420604] i nvestigators after approval by [CONTACT_420605].    The investigators may share data including imaging data, with outside investigators or 
collaborators but only after all identifying information is  removed.  The subject’s dat a, 
including imaging data, will be stored t the CNRM Image Processing Core database at NIH. Th ese data may be used for a variety of research purposes including future genetic 
research that we may not be able to specify at this time.    If a subject wishes to remove his samples, they may contact [CONTACT_16310], [CONTACT_420644], in writing or verbally. If the samples are in the CNRM Biorepository , this 
person will notify the CNRM of the subject’s code and his samples and all associated data, including processed images, will be removed from the repository and related databases and destroyed.  
 
5.1.1 Data identifiers – GUID  
 
The CNRM Informatics Core is ultimately responsible for storing all de -identified data 
collected under this protocol on behalf of the DoD. Prior to the transfer of the de -
identified data from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_420548], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_420549].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_420550]. The CNRM Informatics C ore 
does not have access to identified data.  The Informatics Core is led by a Principal Investigator, Yang Fann, PhD, who reports directly to the Informatics Core Steering Committee.  Data entry into the CNRM Informatics Core database will be limited to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_420551], [CONTACT_420647] and database administrative staff.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_420552] a designated 
database administrator will be responsible for uploading data to the CNRM database.  
  
34 
 All data will be coded ( de-identified ) by [CONTACT_258080] 18 specific elements of protected 
health information (PHI) as defined within the HIPAA Privacy Rule including: 
 1. Names.  
2. All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address, city, county, precinct, ZIP Code, and their equivalent geographical codes, except for the initial three digits of a ZIP Code if, according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: a. The geographic unit formed by [CONTACT_420606] 20,000 people. b. The initial three digits of a ZIP Code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people are changed to 000. 3. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, inclu ding 
birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age [ADDRESS_530603] numbers. 9. Health plan beneficiary numbers. 10. Account numbers. 11. Certificate/license numbers.  
12. Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers. 13. Device identifiers and serial numbers. 14. Web universal resource locators (URLs). 15. Internet protocol (IP) address numbers. 16. Biometric identifiers, including fingerprints and voiceprints. 17. Full-face photographic images and any comparable images.  
18. Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code, unless otherwise permitted by [CONTACT_280134] -identification.  
 
Of these 18 elements, the only one that represents a key clinical/scientific value is the date- related fields.  In the coded ( de-identified ) data submissions, age will be reflected as 
years, as permitted.   
 In order to de -identify the specimens, the CNRM Informatics Core will establish an 
encrypted system to generate a globally unique identifier (GUID) from PHI data.  The GUIDs approach was originally created for the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and the Simons Foundation Autism Research Ini tiative.  The GUID system of 
the CNRM was established in collaboration with the NDAR staff at the NIH Center for Information Technology, but operates independently of the existing NDAR GUID system, under the support of the CNRM Informatics Core.  The GUID is a computer -
generated alphanumeric code that is unique to each research participant and, through the use of a one -way hash algorithm, does not allow mappi[INVESTIGATOR_420553].  The 
  
[ADDRESS_530604] protected terminal(s) in locked rooms 
with limited access.  Electronic m aster key records will be backed up electronically at 
least weekly.  Physical printouts/copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] m aster keys will be kept in a lock ed cabinet in

more frequent intervals.  The mappi[INVESTIGATOR_420554], but by [CONTACT_420607] [CONTACT_7089] m aster keys.  
  All specimens and data will be stored linked to this GUID.  CNRM m aster keys will 
contain the following information: GUID, last name, last 4 digits SSN, date of birth, and/or medical record number.   The CNRM Biorepository will maintain a web -based Biorepository Information 
Management System. The system includes the following types of information: specimens received, specimens processed, method of specimen storage, method of speci men 
transport, contacts for specimen transport to specific studies, specimens distributed to other CNRM studies, as well as quality control information (acquisition of correct specimen, rapid specimen preservation, timely transportation to the Biorepository, routine and continuous monitoring).    Access to data will only be available to the CNRM Biorepository Manager, PI [INVESTIGATOR_47473], or designated staff on this protocol.  All data and samples under this protocol 
will be obtained in an identifying manner.  Once the specimens and pertinent clinical records or accompanying data are confirmed for quality care purposes, all specimens and data will be de -identified  (coded)  (maintained/stored remotely) without protected health 
identifiers.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_420555] s protocol will maintain m aster keys, matching de -identified 
(coded ) samples  and data. We will act consistently with the HIPAA regulations. The 
CNRM Bioinformatics Repository will provide for the imaging and CTDB data to be periodically transferred to NIH CIT, where the data repository is to be housed.  All paper records regarding subjects will be kept in folders in locked, secure areas.   5.3 Withdrawal and destruction of data and samples : Participants will be allowed to 
withdraw from the study at any point. The study investigators may also withdraw participants for medical, administrative or issues of noncompliance. If a participant withdraws voluntarily or is withdrawn from the study, any remaining unused samples and/or data identified as theirs will be d estroyed at their request. If they do not request 
that their samples and data be withdrawn/destroyed, they will continue to be used in the analysis as applicable.

 5.4 Repository for Samples   
 
The draft of MTA is in the process of being finalized. The samples belong to CNRM 
(collaboration between NIH and DOD) and will be stored at the CNRM Biorepository at [ADDRESS_530605], Rockville, MD, [ZIP_CODE].   The draft is attached as Appendix 
E. 
 
6.  Additional Considerations  
 
 6.1 Research  with Methylphenidate:  Investigational New Drug Exemption from FDA.  
FDA has granted an exemption from IND regulations for this study (see attached letter).  The number is (TBD)  (Appendix I) 
         6.1.1 Source of methylphenidate and placebo storage and handling: The research pharmacists at the NIH research pharmacy will manufacture the methylphenidate (30 mg) so that they are without markings. The storage bottl es will have 
child -proof caps. The NIH research pharmacists will be in charge of storing, 
randomizing, dispensing to study personnel, and destroying the study medication.  The 
study coordinator, research assistant, or i nvestigator may retrieve the medication from the 
NIH pharmacy and deliver it to the physician i nvestigator.  A licensed physician 
investigator listed in this protocol as having this privilege will dispense the study 
medication to subjects.  
 
6.1.2 Package Insert (Appendix B) 
 
6.2 Gene Therapy:  There is no gene therapy in this study.   
 
1. Risks/Discomforts  
 
7.1 The known risks and discomforts associated with the study procedures include the following:  
7.1.[ADDRESS_530606] pacemakers or other 
implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm 
clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_32284], heart valves, and cochlear implants), pe rmanent eyeliner, implanted delivery 
  
[ADDRESS_530607] is positive.   Steps taken to minimize risks associated with MRI:   Potential participants will be screened for safety by [CONTACT_420608].    During the MRI and PET scans, monitoring equipment (blood pressure, oxygen saturation and/or heart monitoring) will be utilized as medically indicated, and the subject can be observed directly through a window between two rooms or via closed circuit televi sion.  In addition, audible communication between the patient and the scanning 
personnel is possible via intercom.  S ubjects can be removed from the scanner 
immediately upon request or in case of medical necessity.  
All subjects having a research MRI will be fitted with hearing protection.  Pregnant women are excluded from this study.  
7.1.3 Neuropsychological Testing 
 
There are no known risks to participants answering questions about distress, pain, fatigue, depression or anxiety.  Possible adverse experiences include mild psychological distress or discomfort by [CONTACT_420609]’s distress or boredom from answering questions.    Steps taken to minimize risk:  Prior to testing, the investigator administering the tests will encourage subjects to try their best, remind them that no one performs perfectly on these tests, and that the tests may be stopped at any time and for any reason.  If a participant 
becomes emotionally distressed while completing any of the instruments, they will be informed that they may postpone or stop the procedure and decline participation altogether.  
 The psychological measures will be monitored by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator after administration for 
clinically significant symptoms.  If a participant discloses information during completion of the assessment form that suggests a danger to themselves or others, or suggests a need for psychiatric intervention, the PI w ill be notified and will offer referral as appropriate 
  
38 
 for psychiatric or other evaluation with a clinician and/or for psychiatric assistance with a 
provider in their home community together with follow -up by [CONTACT_420610].  Moreover, should the questionnaires in this study 
raise issues a participant would like to discuss further,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_420556].    
7.[ADDRESS_530608] common adverse reactions but are usually 
controlled by [CONTACT_420611].  Other reactions include : hypersensitivity (including skin rash, urticaria, fever, arthralgia, 
exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme w ith histopathological findings of 
necrotizing vasculitis, and thrombocytopenic purpura); anorexia; nausea; dizziness; palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]; headache; dyskinesia; drowsiness; blood pressure and pulse changes, both up and down; tachycardia; angina; cardiac arrhythmi a; abdominal pain; weight loss 
during prolonged therapy.   There have been rare reports of Tourette’s syndrome. Toxic psychosis has been reported. Although a definite causal relationship has not been established, the following have been reported in patients taking this drug: instances of abnormal liver function, ranging from transaminase elevation to hepatic coma; isolated  cases of cerebral arteritis and/or 
occlusion; leukopenia and/or anemia; transient depressed mood; aggressive behavior; a few instances o f scalp hair loss. There are very rare reports of neuroleptic malignant 
syndrome (NMS ), and, in most of these, patients were concurrently receiving therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420557] .

Steps taken to minimize risks of methylphenidate :   
 
There will be a telephone follow- up 2 weeks after Visit #[ADDRESS_530610] possible adverse interactions with methylphenidate. Licensed physician /investigators may 
prescribe medication for headache or other minor side effects.  Otherwise, patients will be instructed to seek medical attention from their personal  physician.  
 Emergen cy medical problems will be managed by [CONTACT_420612]. Participants will be evaluated and can be admitted to 7SWN Neurology Unit, or 3SWS Intensive Care Unit, as needed, under circumstances including, but not limited to:  
  
40 
 •Seizure 
•Severe psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, akathisia, psychosis •Any other unforeseen complication requiring acute medical stabilization 
 Care will be provided until the subject is stable, can continue research participation or until care can be transferred to the subject’s own health care providers. For medical  
problems or conditions that occur outside the NIH Clinical Center, participants will need to seek care and treatment from their primary care physician or a local emergency room.  
 To prevent risks of methylphenidate on the fetus, s exually active women who are able to 
become pregnant must agree to use an effective method of contraception as stated at 11.[ADDRESS_530611] 
data only and information obtained for research purposes will be stored in loc ked offices 
as described in Section 19, “Confidentiality”.   
7.4 Risks of sharing research data   
 
Samples and data provided to the CNRM Repository, which is operated under USUHS Protocol No. CNRM -004 “Biorepository and Informatics Warehousing”, [CONTACT_314506] M. 
Cox, PI [INVESTIGATOR_420558] a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) derived from PII and generated locally.  Re- identification of data and samples collected at the NIH would be 
possible if repository data and samples are released with the GUID to other CNRM investigators who have access to the same subjects PII through participation in other IRB 
approved studies as they will generate the same GUID at their site.  Re- identification is 
unlikely, however, as the CNRM Repository intends in most cases to release da ta and 
samples without the GUID.  
 
Steps taken to minimize risks of breach of conf identiality of records or data: 
The following measures will be made to minimize foreseeable risks: 
• All research procedures will be conducted by [CONTACT_420613] 8 and 11. • Confidentiality will be protected as described in Section 19. • Use of subject data that is re- identified through PHI used to generate a GUID is 
permitted only under IRB approved protocols with pre-defined research questions.      
 
 
  
41 
 7.5 Risk of TMS  
 
There is an extremely small but existent possibility of a seizure during TMS. The danger is even lower with non- repetitive single or paired pulse TMS (<1 Hz), as in this study. 
Extensive use in our laboratory has not resulted in any difficulties with the device that could pose a hazard to healthy volunteers or patients. TMS can  lead to  hearing loss in 
experimental animals by [CONTACT_420614]. However, we found no evidence of chronic hearing loss in several of our normal subjects who were  extensively studied with TMS, nor did 
we find transient changes in several subjects tested before, and immediately after, stimulation.  TMS does not appear to pose any hazard to the brain beyond that of electric 
stimulation, which has been in clinical use for decades. The procedure appears to be safe and without any side effects. Some of the or iginal subjects have been stimulated many 
thousands of times. The World Health Organization task group and the Food and Drug Administration concluded that brief exposure to static magnetic fields up to [ADDRESS_530612] is headache, which usually fade s over 
a few hours and responds well to non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs.  
 
7.6 Risk of PET  
 
Radiation exposure during the PET scan: This research study involves exposure to radiation from 2 PET scans that use a total of 20 mCi X  2 (40 mCi). 
of the [
11C]raclopride , plus a small amount of radiation from the transmission scan done 
to calibrate the scanner. The amount of radiation subjects  will receive in this study is 1.0 
rem which is below the guideline of 5 rem per year allowed for research subjects by [CONTACT_420615]. The average person in the [LOCATION_002] receives a 
radiation exposure of 0.3 rem per year  from natural sources, such as the sun, outer space, 
and the earth's air and soil. While there is no direct evidence that the amount of exposur e 
received from participating in this study is harmful, there is indirect evidence it may not be completely safe. There may be a very slight increase in the risk of cancer.   
 Risks of intravenous catheterization : Subjects may experience minor discomfort 
associated with intravenous catheterizations . Minor bruising or infection may occur at the 
site of needle entry.  There is a very small risk of fainting during the  procedure.  Standard 
procedures will be used, including seating the patient during the procedure and a short period of observation afterwards. There is no known allergy to raclopride.   
 
  
  
[ADDRESS_530613] pregnancy tests at each clinic visit.  
Participants remain under the care of their own physicians during participation in this study. Any adverse events reported to their own physicians will be recorded.  
 
8.2 Parameters  to be monitored    
 Physiological side effects (adverse events) of study medication will be monitored in this study. Medication administration compliance will also be monitored.  
 
8.3 Toxicity 
 
Signs and symptoms of acute overdosage, resulting principally from overstimulation of 
the central nervous system and f rom excessive sympathomimetic effects, may include the 
following: vomiting, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, convulsions 
(may be followed by [CONTACT_355797]), euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, sweating, flushing, headache, hyperpyrexi a, tachycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], cardiac arrhythmias, 
hypertension, mydriasis, and dryness of mucous membranes.  Treatment consists of appropriate supportive measures. The patient will be protected against self -injury and against external stimuli that would a ggravate overstimulation 
already present. Gastric contents may be evacuated by [CONTACT_420616]. In the presence of severe intoxication, a carefully titrated dosage of a short -acting barbiturate  will be used  
before performing gastric lavage. Other measures t o detoxify the gut include 
administration of activated charcoal. Intensive care will be provided to maintain adequate circulation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_320756]; external cooling procedures may be required for hyperpyrexia.

return the unused medications and will be terminated from the study.   
 Subjects will be allowed to withdraw from participation in the study at a ny point without 
adversely affecting their medical management.  Subjects may decline some of the procedures and tests and still participate in this research study.  The investigators may also withdraw subjects from the study for medical, administrative or issues of non-compliance.  If subjects withdraw, any remaining unused samples that can be identified as theirs will be discarded.  Subjects will be offered the opportunity to withdraw their data from the study.

 9. Outcome measures    
 
Outcome measures will be neuropsychological tests  of CDE (1 -8) and tests of various 
aspects of attention 6 (9-12). These tests will be administered twice, at the visit 2 initia l 
and after 4 weeks of methylphenidate therapy.

10.  Statistical Analysis 
 10.1 Analysis  of Data for Primary Objective Primary  Hypothesis: Tonic DA release 
(ΔBPND) will be associated with improvement over 4 weeks (i.e., patients with higher 
tonic DA release will demonstrate greater improvement in processing speed), independent of baseline DA D2/DR receptor binding.  Spearman correlation an alysis will 
be used to evaluate relationship of ΔBPND  in the striatum and the processing speed. 
Regression analysis will be used to  analyze relationship of tonic DA release in in 
additional anatomical structures (caudate, putamen, and PFC ROIs ) (left and right sides 
will be averaged) to the processing speed as a primary outcome measure.  
 The primary objective is to assess the relationship between tonic DA release and change in processing speed after 4 weeks of treatment with oral methylphenidat e. The primary 
endpoint of the study will be change of processing speed. Change of processing speed will be measured separately by [CONTACT_420618] -IV Processing Speed Index (PSI) and by [CONTACT_420619] (Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test) and will be used as a composite derived as an average of two scores.  NIH tool box tests have not been validated in TBI which justifies use of the composite and individual measures of processing speed.  We will use individual and composite scores for assessing processing 
speed.   
 The primary outcome is change in information processing speed during neuropsychologic testing.   
  
[ADDRESS_530617] of the enrolled participants for our outcome analysis.  The Conners  Continuous 
Performance (CPT) test and Toolbox Processing Speed were administered to [ADDRESS_530618] was successfully tested on 4,859 participants
33: the study found that it is appropriate for use in the age cohort 
of participants in our study and the test has good test- retest and discriminant 
validity.   Therefore, we propose to use the Conners CPT and Toolbox Processing Speed Test as outcome measures for measurements of processing speed and attention in this study.   This will allow us to use the data already collected from our patients with 
confidence that these measures will allow us to reach our outcome goals.  
 
Analysis plan:  
1.  We plan to analyze outcomes of all (enrolled and planned) participants using 
Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Processing Speed and the Conners 
CPT.  
2.  We will continue to colle ct all outcome measures of processing speed for all 
future participants when the study is once again open to recruitment.  
3. After we complete data collection, we plan to conduct data analysis including the [ADDRESS_530619] all data collected.  
 
  10.2 Power Analysis for Primary Objective.  
The change in processing speed over 4 weeks of methylphenidate therapy will be 
correlated using Spearman’s non- parametric test to ∆ BPND, a measure of tonic DA 
release.  We hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between the change (improvement) in processing  speed  and both the level of baseline DA receptor binding as 
well as with tonic DA release, but that the correlation will be stronger with the latter.  
  
47 
 With a sample size of 30, power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05, the study is powered to detect a 
correlation coefficient of 0.45.  This is considered a medium correlation, and is lower 
than the correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_530620]. Volkow et al 11. Power 
calculations done using web- based calculator found at : 
www.stattools.net/SSizcorr_Pgm.php . 
 The third and fourth secondary hypotheses are purely exploratory and there are insufficient preliminary data to allow a power calculation.    We initially excluded participants with BMI > [ADDRESS_530621] dopamine receptor availability for binding 
raclopride. Then we increased the allowable maximum body mass index (BMI) from [ADDRESS_530622] the statistical power to use BMI as an independent var iable.   
 
The initial sample size for the study was calculated based on a similar study 
conducted by [CONTACT_420620] (Volkow et al., 2001).  That study measured the correlation between dopamine release (as measured by 11C -raclopride PET) and improvement 
in attention tests after methylphenidate treatment and found a significant correlation with R = 0.55.  Initially, for the current study we calculated a sample size of 30 using a more conservative correlation of 0.45.  Based on this sample size calculation, we received funding from CNRM to enroll 30 patients.  
 During implementation of the protocol it was noticed that the attention tests which represent the main outcome of the study were inadvertently not collected on 6 of 11 patients, diminishing the number of subjects available for analysis of the main study outcome.   This was reported to the IRB as Problem Report III (submitted 
07/08/2015).   
 
Furthermore, after one year of the study the charges for PET studies which were significantly more than anticipated. The study is funded by [CONTACT_420621], and funding was 
allocated for 30 scans ($4000 each) or $120,[ADDRESS_530623] time at $164,877.[ADDRESS_530624] was not administered one of the neurocognitive tests.  Data on 8 participants were available for analysis. We measured non- displaceable binding potential (BPND) before and after 
administration of 60 mg methylphenidate (MP) in the ventral striatum (VS) as the change in BPND after administration of MP (BPND) is used as a measure of 
dopamine (DA) release.   We selected [ADDRESS_530625]. Dsurney, a CNRM Neuropsychology Director, a variable Detectability can be selected as the representative outcome.  We used Fisher's z Test for Pearson Correlation and SAS program for sample size calculation.  The Pearson correlation between DA release in 10 ROIs and change in Detectability was determined as r=0.[ZIP_CODE] (0.1039) (mean (SD)) and with range (0.8043-0.4646). This is very close to the value reported by [CONTACT_304092]. With r=0.56 and alfa=0.05 and power 0.8, 22 patients will be a sufficient sample size for our study.   
 
Therefore, our interim data analysis supports the use of correlation r=0.[ADDRESS_530626] selection:  Selection equitability:  Subject selection will be equitable.  
Participants will be recruited from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center 
(WRNMMC), National Institutes of Health Clinic al Center (NIH CC), CNRM 
Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_420562], CNRM Recruitment Core, regional Veterans Affairs (VA) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NiCOE).  Subject selection will be equitable. This study allows adults up to age [ADDRESS_530627] those of the clinical population affected by [CONTACT_420622].  No preference or 
exclusion will be granted according to gender or ethnic/racial background.  We anticipate that approximately 90% of the subjects will be male, because recruitment will include military individuals.   11.2  Justification for exclusion of children: Participants younger than [ADDRESS_530628] development and recovery of children’s  brain after TBI.   
 
  
49 
 11.3 Justification for the exclusion of vulnerable populations:  pregnant women, mentally 
ill, and cognitively imp aired subjects . We are uncertain whether methylphenidate, PET, 
MRI o r TMS  are  safe for a pregnant woman or a fetus ; thus, pregnant women are 
excluded from this research study cognitively impaired subjects are excluded because 
they would not be able to consent for themselves, follow instructions, complete the neurocogniti ve measures, and be responsible for study medication.  Potential participants 
with mental illness sufficiently severe to impair their ability to provide inf ormed consent 
will be excluded . 
  11.4   Justification for sensitive procedures: use of placebo This trial uses placebo  crossover design , but only for PET imaging  and for TMS . All 
participants will receive the active drug during the 4- week administration  phase.  
 11.[ADDRESS_530629] : Non-English speakers 
will be excluded because the neuropsychological assessment instruments we are using are not all validated or normed in other languages.  Furthermore, many of the tests we are performing would require a native -speaking psychometrist to administer ; such an 
individual is not available.    11.6 Safeguards for Vulnerable Subjects : Given the morbidity common in symptomatic 
chronic TBI, we anticipate that several medical or psychiatric complications might arise during the course of the study visits.  Participants who exhibit psychiatric complications 
will then undergo a structured interview by a qualified on- site professional and referred 
for appropriate medical care by [CONTACT_420623]. Other emergent psychiatric evaluation and treatment will be performed under the guidance of the NIMH Psychiatry Consultation Service. 11.7 Justification for exclusion of NIH Employees  
 We do not anticipate that NIH employees would be eligible for this study because they would be unlikely to fulfill the inclusion criteria of having a TBI with persistent memory and attention problems and significant impairment of social and/or occupational functioning and be employed full time at NIH.  Further, the study procedures are time -
consuming and are carried out during office hours over  a few days’ time.  This would 
require NIH employees to take [ADDRESS_530630] s 
will not undergo MRI. Contraception is required for women able  to become pregnant  as 
stated at 11.6 of the protocol.   Emergen cy medical problems will be managed by [CONTACT_420612]. Participants will be evaluated and can be admitted to 7SWN Neurology Unit, or 3SWS Intensive Care Unit, as needed, under circumstances including, but not limited to:  
  
50 
 •Seizure 
•Severe psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, akathisia, psychosis •Any other unforeseen complication requiring acute medical stabilization.  Care will be provided until the subject is stable, can continue research participation or until care can be transferred to the subject’s own health care providers.  
For medical problems or conditions that occur outside of the NIH Clinical Center, participants will need to seek care and treatment from their primary care physician or a local emergency room.  
 
Contraception requirement for females able to become pregnant  
   
Women able to become pregnant  will be required to have a pregnancy test at each clinic 
visit.  Sexually active women who are able to become pregnant must agree to use an 
effective method of contraception (birth control) from the t ime they enroll in the study 
until [ADDRESS_530631] completed taking the study drug, methylphenidate or placebo.  
Effective methods of contraception for this study include: 1. hormonal contraception (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injected hormones or vaginal ring)  
2. intrauterine device 3. barrier methods (condom or diaphragm) combined with spermicide.  4. surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or vasectomy in a partner.  It will be explained to them that it is important to know that no method of birth control is totally effective in preventing pregnancy except for surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men) and total abstinence from sexual relations.  
 If it is discovered that a woman is pregnant who has been taking study medication, we will stop medication.  She will be followed for the remainder of the study and will be referred to her physician for further follow -up.  This will be reported to the IRBs of 
record.  
Rationale for BMI>40 exclusion 
In the study we initially excluded participants with BMI > [ADDRESS_530632] dopamine receptor availability for binding raclopride.  Our concern came from a study of Volkow et al.
341 in 
obese people with BMI 42-60 (mean 51), compared to subjects with BMI 21-28 (mean 25).  They found that dopamine receptor availability was decreased in proportion to BMI in the obese participants.    Now, however, we are finding that BMI in the 30-[ADDRESS_530633] this in the 
literature .

[ADDRESS_530636]  Benefit  
The information we gain from this study may help us more effectively diagnose and treat subjects with TBI in the future.  P articipants may indirectly benefit from administration 
of methylphenidate , and that information may be of value in seeking medical care from 
their primary care physicians .   
13.  Classification of Risk  
 
This protocol is classified as a more than minimal risk study due to the use of methylphenidate and administration of [11C] -raclopride before PET.  Risk is reasonable 
in relation to an ticipated benefit.  
14.  Consent Documents and Process  
14.1 Designation of those obtaining consent:  Study investigators designated as able to 
obtain consent in section 11.6 above, will obtain informed consent.  14.2 Consent  procedures:  Informed consent will be obtained directly from the participant 
(no surrogate).  At the diagnostic  visit, the investigator able to obtain consent listed in 
section 11.[ADDRESS_530637]’s chart. All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures and potential risks of the study and of 
  
[ADDRESS_530638] the opportunity to carefully 
review the written consent form and ask questions regarding this study prior to signing.  14.3 Consent documents:  The standard  consent form contains all required elements. 
15. Data and Safety Monitoring  
 15. [ADDRESS_530639] acting as the independent Medical Monitor, 
will supervise patient safety.  
 15.2   Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  The independent Medical Monitor will monitor data and safety in an ongoing manner.  The Medical Monitor will be contact[CONTACT_420624] 
(SAE) that is related to the protocol and all deaths and at least quarterly for other SAEs in compliance with NIH and IRB requirements.  The study team will provide the Medical Monitor with a report every six months s o that he can check for any safety issues and 
threatening trends.  He will provide yearly reports.   As the principal  investigator, [CONTACT_420644] will be contact[CONTACT_420625]. The Medical Monitor, [CONTACT_420650], will also be notified of SAEs by [CONTACT_219437].  He will provide yearly reports that will be submitted to the NIH and USUHS IRBs with the continuing review.  He will promptly report discrepancies or problems to the IRB and shall have the authority to stop the study, remove individual subjects from the study, and take whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well -being of research subjects until the IRB can 
assess the independent medical monitor's report.  
15.[ADDRESS_530640] been satisfactorily addressed can the protocol be re- activated.  
There will be an annual continuing review of this study at the NIH and USUHS IRBs. 
  
55 
 16.  Quality Assurance 
This protocol will undergo periodic review by [CONTACT_316369] (QA) Audit 
Committee as outlined in the NINDS QA Standard Operating Procedure.  The purpose of the QA audit is to assess compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, good clinical practice guidelin es, NINDS policy, as well as to provide recommendations for 
improving the management of clinical research data.  The protocol will be audited according to the decision algorithm as described in the NINDS SOP . 
 In addition, the NINDS QA team will do extra Q A monitoring of the protocol.  After the 
first 3 -5 participants are enrolled and every 6 months afterwards, the team will monitor 
the protocol by [CONTACT_420626]. Any noted deviations and violations will be reported to the PI.  The team will issue complete reports of monitoring visits to the PI.   
17. Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events and 
Protocol Deviations  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_28874], documenting, and reporting unanticipated problems, adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), and deviations in accordance with NIH policy, IRB requirements, and federal regulations. Relatedness to the research of all serious adverse events will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_214597].   Serious unanticipated problems and serious protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB and CD as soon as possible and in writing on the Problem Report Form not more than [ADDRESS_530641] learns of the event.   All adverse events, deviations, and unanticipated problems will be summarized and reported at the time of Continuing Review.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_32306] 21 
CFR 312.64(b) and as agreed upon with the sponsor. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_420566]. There is no requirement from the sponsor to report non serious SAE's within specified time frame .  
 
  
[ADDRESS_530642] care 
for TBI from their own physician.  Subjects may choose not to participate in this study.  
An alternative may be for his or her own physician to prescribe methylphenidate off label.  
19. Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of patient files will be maintained at all times.  Paper records and case report forms will be maintained in locked rooms, or in computer files protected by  
[CONTACT_420627].  The collected data will be accessible only by [CONTACT_420628].  
In the presentation of research results, no information will be given that may reveal the identity of the research subjects.  The consent form will discuss patient confidentiality protection.  Confidentiality of the patient records will be protected to the extent possible under existing regulations and laws but cannot be guaranteed.  Complete confidentiality cannot be promised, especially to military personnel, because information bearing on their health may be required to be reported to appropriate medical or command authorities. Representatives of the study sponsor (CNRM), the Henry M Jackson Foundation, US Department of Defense (DoD), and NIH may have access to the study data for audit purposes.  Since we are collecting sensitive information, including data on patient’s functional 
capacity, there is a risk of the release of sensitive information.  The risk of breaches of patient confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_420629].  In addition, all identified clinical data will be stored in servers that are backed up and password protected, or in locked files in secure areas.  Only NIH study investigators will have access to the key to the codes and identifiable data.   
 Each study participant will be assigned a  study number that will be used on study data 
collection forms and samples. The link between the study number and participants’ identity will be kept on a password -protected computer.  Only study researchers and 
members of the IRB will have access to ident ified information.  Data transmitted to the 
Data Coordinating Center will be coded. Investigators at the clinical site where consent was obtained will have access to identifying information for the patients enrolled in the study at their site.  Only coded de- identified information will be shared with persons 
outside of the enrolling site, except for audits.   NIH will assign a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) to all data submitted to the CNRM Repository. The purpose of the GUID is to allow data on the same s ubject, from multiple 
protocols and from different institutions, to be identified as coming from a single individual and to be combined in the repository.  PII will be entered on a local server and a one -way encryption using a keyed- hash algorithm will be used to assign the GUID.  
CNRM will not receive PII.  The one -way encryption assures that the GUID cannot be 
used to back -generate PII.  Data that were delinked may then be sent to other non- CNRM 
Biorepository. 
  
[ADDRESS_530643] in the PI’s 
office and accessible only to his designees. Some information will be on a password-secured server in one of the Investigator’s offices on the NIH campus.  To help us protect the study participant’s privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. With this Certificate, the researchers cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify the participant, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The researche rs will use the Certificate to resist any 
demands for information that would identify the participant, except as explained below.  The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the [LOCATION_002] Government that is used  for auditing or evaluation of federally funded 
projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We explained in the consent form that a Certificate of Confidentiality d oes not prevent 
the participant or a member of their family from voluntarily releasing information about 
themselves  or their involvement in this research. If an insurer, employer, or other person 
obtains their written consent to receive research informatio n, then the researchers may 
not use the Certificate to withhold that information.  
 The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from disclosing voluntarily, without  consent, information that would identify them as a participant in t he 
research project if they discover child, spousal, or elder abuse or that the participant has an intent to hurt himself or others.   Military: In addition to the voluntary disclosures listed above, participants who are active members of the military  will not have guarantees that their information will be kept

We invite you to take part in a research study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  
First, we want you to know that:  
 Taking part in NIH research is entirely voluntary.  
 You may choose not to take part, or you may withdraw from the study at any time.  In either case, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  However, to receive care at the NIH, you must be taking part in a study or be under evaluatio n for study participation.  
 You may receive no benefit from taking part.  The research may give us knowledge that may help people in the future.  
Second, some people have personal, religious or ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of medical or research  treatments 
they would want to receive (such as blood transfusions).  If you have such beliefs, please discuss them with your NIH 
doctors or research team before you agree to the study.  
 
Now we will describe this research study.  Before you decide to take part, please take as much time as you need to ask 
any questions and discuss this study with anyone at NIH, or with family, friends or your personal physician or other health professional.  
  
Purpose  
 You are participating in this protocol because you have suffered a traumatic brain injury  (TBI) . You may have memory 
and attention problems  . We want to measure the effect of methylphenidate  (Ritalin®)  on your brain using various brain 
scans and memory and thinking  tests  and questionnaires . This will help us to know if methylphenidate  is affecting your 
brain.  
  
Background 
 
Problems  in memory, attention, and decision- making  are  very common after TBI. A brain chemical called dopamine  helps 
with attention and memory . A traumatic  brain injury  can affect this chemical, dopamine. . Increasing dopamine has been 
shown to improve attention and memory in some people.  Drug called  methylphenidate  (Ritalin) can increase dopamine 
levels It is used in people who have problems with attention. We want to see if methylphenidate  increases dopamine in a 
person who had a TBI .   
We will use a type of brain scan called positron emission tomography (PET) and another procedure called transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS).  These procedures will show us if methylphenidate is working on your dopamine levels.  
 We will use a brain scan called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It helps us see if you have any injury to your brain.

 MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_138379]. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder 
surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the MRI, you will lie on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. You will be in the scanner about 1 hour.  We may ask you to lie still for up to 15 minutes at a t ime. While in the scanner 
you will hear loud knocking noises, and you will be fitted with earplugs to muffle the sound. You will be able to 
communicate with the MRI staff at all times during your scan . You may ask to come out of the scanner  at any time . You 
do not do anything during the MRI.  
 
4) Neuropsychological Testing  
Neuropsychological testing may include tests of your memory, attention, concentration and thinking.  We may interview 
you and  ask you to complete questionnaires . You may also  take pen -and-paper or computerized tests and perform 
simple actions.  This will take about  [ADDRESS_530658] these tests two times during the study , which may be at 
visits 1,  or 2,  and  4.  
 
5) Study Drug   
 
DOSING:   The study drug will be methylphenidate  which you take  by [CONTACT_1966]. You will take  methylphenidate 60 mg or 
placebo on visit 2 before the TMS sessions.. You will take  methylphenidate 60 mg  or placebo on visit 3 before PET scans. 
You will not know when you will be taking the active drug and when you are taking the placebo. In addition, on visit 3,  
we will give you the study drug for  4 weeks . You will take 5 mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_420569]  a day  for 3 days and then 10 mg daily for 
the next 3 days. This is a gradual increase in dose over about a week’s time. We will call you one week after visit [ADDRESS_530659] had any side effects after taking t he drug.  If you get: a) allergic reactions, heart attack, stroke, 
stomach pain, psychosis, get uncontrolled movements in your body, hair loss or mood change , we will ask you to stop the 
drug. If you get : b) headache, change s in blood pressure or heart rate, or trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_420570]. If you do not have any side effects, you will take [ADDRESS_530660] 
side effects  mentioned earlier as a)  from  the drug, you  will stop  the drug. If you get side effects  as b), we will ask you to  
lower the dose . The doctor will tell you how to lower the dose. .  You will take this lower dose until the end of the study  
and not go back up .  .. You will take on the day of visit 4. You will return all unused pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. W e will count them on visit 4. 
You will stop taking the drug after visit 4 is completed.  
 
 
6) TMS   
 We will do this twice, once before and on ce after you take the study drug .  Each of the [ADDRESS_530661]  one movement. 
We will use these measurements of the movements as a baseline for your brain. We will compare them with  the 
movements that are made during the main part of the experiments.  TMS with and without the study drug can be done on 
separate visits (visits #1,  #2 or #3).

7) Effort task  
 
You will do this task  twice, once before and once  after you take the study drug. You will sit in front of a computer screen, 
which will give you the task instructions.  It will ask you to make a movement, which activates a hand muscle a lot or a little. The  computer screen will show you how much you are activating it.  Sometimes we will give you  the choice of how 
much to activate  it. W e will pay you different amounts of money to make the different activations.  However, you will not 
be paid every time you activate the muscle. The task tak es about 4 0 minutes . The tasks without and with the  study drug 
can be done on separate visits (visits #1, #2 or #3).   
 
8) PET Procedure  
 Before performing the PET scan, you will t ake one dose of methylphenidate [ADDRESS_530662] 
an intravenous catheter placed in your arm. This is done by [CONTACT_2329] a needle to guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into your elbow crease area. The needle will be removed, leaving only the catheter in the vein. The catheter will be taped to the skin to hold i t in place. The intravenous catheter will be used for the injection of a small amount of the radioactive 
substance [11C]raclopride. This substance travels to the brain and tells us where a chemical called dopamine is acting.  
  
During the time the catheter is in place, you need to keep your arm still. T he catheter should  not move. Once the 
catheter is in place, a swimming cap with small light reflectors will be put on your head. It is used to monitor the position  
of your head during the scan. You will be scanned for approximately [ADDRESS_530663] another infusion of 
raclopride through the cathete r in your arm, and repeat the 2 -hour PET scan.  We will ask you to urinate again after the 
second PET  scan.  The scans  with placebo and the study drug can be done on the same day or on different days (visits 
#1, #2 or #3) .  
 The study procedures are described below  visit- by-visit.  All visits will be done at the NIH Clinical Center .
 
 
Visit 1 ( will take approximately to 3  hours).   During your first visit, you will have the following procedures as 
described above:  
1) Study explanation and sign informed consent  
2) Blood draw  
3) Urine collection for pregnancy testing (if applicable)   
4) TBI history, surveys and medical history  
5) Neurological examination  
6) MRI  
 
Visit 2  (will take about  5 hours ). You will return to the NIH Neurology Clinic within [ADDRESS_530664] the  following :

3) The research assistant will review a list of symptoms with you.   
4) You will have an interview with one of the study doctors to discuss any symptoms you may have experienced.  
5) Neuropsychological testing  
6) MRI  
7) You will return unused  pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. 
 
Risks, Inconveniences and Discomforts    
 1) Blood Drawing:   You may have some discomfort and bruising at the site of needle entry. There is a very small risk 
of fainting. Infection in the area of the needle insertion is rare . 
 2) Risks  associated with MRI:   People are at risk for injury from the  MRI magnet if they have pacemakers or other 
implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_32284], heart valves, and cochlear implants), permanent 
eyeliner, implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments. Welders and metal workers are also at risk  for injury .  They 
may have  small metal fragments in the ir eye without knowing it.  You will be screened for these conditions before having 
any scan, and if you have any, you will not receive an MRI scan.  If you have a question about any metal objects being 
present in your body, you should inform the staff.  In addition, all magnet ic objects (for example, watches, coins, jewelry, 
and credit cards) must be removed before entering the MRI scan room.  
 It is not known if MRI is completely safe for a developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. Therefore, all women of  able to become pregnant  will 
have a pregnancy test performed no more than [ADDRESS_530667]  •  Adult Patient or    •  Parent, for Minor Patient

 people who already have hearing loss. Everyone having a research MRI scan will be fitted with hearing protection. If the 
hearing protect ion comes loose during the scan, you should let us know right away. Please notify the investigators if you 
have hearing or ear problems. You will be asked to complete an MRI screening form for each MRI scan you have. There 
are no known long -term risks of MRI scans. 
3) Risks associated with PET : Radiation exposure during the PET scan: This research study involves exposure to 
radiation from 2 PET scans that use a total of 24 millicuries of the [11C]raclopride, plus a small amount of radiation from the transmi ssion scan done to calibrate the scanner. This radiation exposure is not required for your medical care and is 
for research purposes only. The amount of radiation you will receive in this study is 0.6 rem which is below the guideline 
of 5 rem per year allowed for research subjects by [CONTACT_110712]. The average person in the 
[LOCATION_002] receives a radiation exposure of 0.3 rem per year from natural sources, such as the sun, outer space, and 
the earth's air and soil.  
If you would like more information about radiation, please ask the investigator for a copy of the pamphlet, An Introduction to Radiation for NIH Research Subjects.  
While there is no direct evidence that the amount of exposure received from participating in this study is harmful, there is 
indirect evidence it may not be completely safe. There may be a very slight increase in the risk of cancer.  
Please tell us if you have had any radiation exposure in the past year, either from other research studies or from medical tests or care, so we can make sure that you will not receive too much radiation. Radiation exposure includes x -rays taken 
in radiology departments, cardiac catheterization, and fluoroscopy as well as nuclear medicine scans in which radioactive materials were injected into your body.  
If you are pregnant,  you will not be permitted to participate in this research study. If you are breast feeding, you will not 
be permitted to participate. It is best to avoid radiation exposure to unborn or nursing infants since they are more 
sensitive to radiation than adults are. 
The radiopharmaceutical used, carbon -11 labeled raclopride, is being administered under an investigational new drug 
(IND) approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA ). Peter Herscovitch, M.D. is the sponsor . The sponsor and 
the FDA have acce ss to the medical records of the research subjects.  
4) Risks  associated with  methylphenidate:    
Side effects of methylphenidate may include nervousness, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], loss of appetite, weight loss, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, or blurred vis ion. Side effects may include allergic reactions, heart attack, abnormal h eart 
rate, stomach pain, stroke , mood  changes, loss of hair.  If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your study 
coordinator or study doctor promptly . You do not have to wait until a planned visit to report adverse events .  You can call 
1-855-2-OnPage ( or +1 (855) 266- 7243 24/7 hours/day.   You can the nearest emergency room in the event of life - 
threatening emergency . 
 
Pregnancy:   Methylphenidate  has not been studied in pregnant women .  We will give a pregnancy test to any woman 
who is  able to become pregnant before enrolling her  into the study .  We will repeat the urine pregnancy test before  MRI, 
PET or TMS .
 You will not be able to enroll in the study  if you are pregnant.   You are not able to  have any more 
methylphenidate , PTEs, TMSs  or MRIs  if the pregnancy test becomes  positive during the study .

 We do not know if the study drug  affects pregnancy or fetal development. Therefore,  sexually active women who are 
able to get pregnant must agree  to use an effective method of contraception (birth control) from the time you enroll in 
the study until  2 weeks  after you completed the study drug.   
 
Effective methods of contraception for this study in clude:  
1. hormonal contraception (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injected hormones or vaginal ring),  
2. intrauterine device  
3. barrier methods (condom or diaphragm) combined with spermicide  
4. surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation ), or vasectomy in a partner.  
 
It is important for you to know that no method of birth control is totally effective in preventing pregnancy except for 
surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men) and total abstinence from sexual 
relations. 
Nursing mothers:  It is not known whether methylphenidate goes into breast milk. As a precaution, nursing mothers 
cannot be in this study.  
5)  Neuropsychological testing: The neuropsychological tests are not harmful, but may be frustrating or stressful. 
We only ask that you try your best. No one performs perfectly on these tasks. You may refuse to answer any question 
or to stop a test at any time and for any reason.  
 6) Ri sks associated with loss of confidentiality : Any time we collect information , there is a potential risk for loss of 
confidentiality.  We will try to keep your information confidential, but this cannot be guaranteed.  If we learn that you are 
a danger to yourself or to others, we will have to report this to the appropriate authorities for your and others’ protection.  
 
Risks associated with TMS:  TMS is a safe procedure that has been used on thousands of patients throughout the 
world. Most people do not find  the stimulation painful, but sometimes strong contractions of scalp muscles can cause 
some discomfort or headache. If you find the procedure too uncomfortable, you may stop it at any time. Headaches 
usually go away promptly with nonprescription medication . The noise of the TMS magnet may affect hearing, so you will 
be fitted with earplugs to wear during TMS. Magnetic stimulation will not be done in people who have pacemakers, 
implanted pumps or stimulators, or who have metal objects inside the eye or skull. Please tell the investigators if you 
have any of these or known hearing loss.   If your pregnancy test is positive, you will not have TMS.  We do not know if 
there is any risk to you or your fetus, but we want to be careful to promote your safety.  
 Risks associated with computer tasks (effort task) : There are no risks from the effort tasks in this study  except 
fatigue or boredom . 
 
Anticipated Benefits : There will be no direct benefit to you from participating in this study . However, we hope to learn 
more about TBI .  
 
Right of Withdrawal and Conditions for Early Withdrawal   
You may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without loss of benefits or privileges to which you are 
otherwise entitled. The investigator can remove you from the study at any time if she or he believes that continuation is 
not in your best medical interest or if you are unable to comply with the requirements of the study.

 We will send your blood samples to a repository without any information that could be used to identify you.   We will not 
be able to destroy your samples if you choose to withdraw from this study because all identifiable information has been removed and will we not be able to tell who provided the sample.     
You might be able to stay in the study even if you find out that you cannot take methylphenidate or do any of the 
procedures.     
You can talk with or write to the study doctor  if you wish  to stop participati ng in the study.  
Results from  this Study  The researchers will not give you  the results of any research tests or evaluations . However, if 
information is developed from this study that may be important for your health, you will be info rmed when it becomes 
available. We will share it with your doctors at your written request.  
Genetic (DNA) Testing: The genetic testing is done for research purposes only.  It will not provide any information about your health or ancestry. It is our policy not to give you results of any genetic testing.  
 
Incidental findings    We will inform you a bout any finding that may require further evaluation or care. We are not able 
to provide evaluation or treatment for these conditions at NIH. If needed, we will refer you to a health care provider. We may not inform you about minor abnormalities that do not have importance for your health or well -being.  
 
Alternatives to Participation or Treatment  This study is for research only and does not replace any therapy that 
your own doctor is giving you.   You will remain under the care of your own doctor s while you are  in this study.   The 
alternative to participating in this study is not to participate.   
Confidentiality  To help us protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National 
Institutes of Health. With this Certificate,  the researchers cannot be forced to give out  information that may identify you, 
even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings.  
The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained below. 
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the [LOCATION_002] Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the 
requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of your family from 
volunta rily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. If an insurer, employer, or other 
person obtains your written consent to receive research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that informa tion.The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from disclosing voluntarily, 
without your consent, information that would identify you as a participant in the research project if they discover child, 
spousal, or elder abuse or that  you have an intent to hurt oneself or others  which is also mandatory MD Department of 
Health reporting.  
In addition to the voluntary disclosures listed above, if you are an active member of the military, you will not have guarantees that your in formation will be kept completely confidential. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this refers to HIV, illicit drug use, alcohol 
abuse, sexual misconduct or abuse, as well as serious criminal behavior, may also be reportable.

Your study information will be kept confidential to the extent possible under existing regulations and laws, but absolute 
confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. Complete confidentiality cannot be promised, especially to military personnel, because information bearing on their health may be required to be repo rted to appropriate medical or command 
authorities. Future research that uses your data may lead to new commercial products, but you will not receive payment for these products. Some future studies may need your health information (such as updated informat ion on your health) 
that we do not already have.  
 Paper records will be kept in locked rooms, or in computer files protected by  [CONTACT_420627].  The collected data 
will be accessible only by [CONTACT_2710].  When research results are presented, no information will be given that may reveal your identity.   
 This study is part of the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM), a joint federal program involving 
the [LOCATION_002] (US) Department of Defense  (DoD) and the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) joining physicians and 
scientists from different specialties to study new approaches to traumatic brain injury  (TBI) research.  The CNRM 
network will collect de -identified clinical data, imaging data, and blood samples contributed from us and other 
participating centers.  Members of the CNRM, Uniformed Services University, Henry M Jackson Foundation, US 
Department of Defense and NIH, may have access to the study data for auditing purposes.  
 If you choose to participate in this protocol, identifiable data collected for this study will be shared with Eric Wassermann, MD and other IRB -approved study investigators who a re working on this study.  
 We may share your data with outside investigators or collaborators but only after all information that can identify you has 
been removed.  This data may be used for a variety of research purposes that we may not be able to speci fy at this time.  
 Data and samples may be shared with other researchers by [CONTACT_456] (CNRM).  All data and samples will have 
personally- identifying information removed and will be coded. The same code will be used for your data and samples 
whenever you participate in a CNRM study.  If you participate in a CNRM study with researchers outside of NIH, those 
researchers may therefore be able to identify samples and data from NIH as yours.  Your samples and data may also be sent to other repositories for storage or additional use.  It will not be possible for other repositories to identify the 
samples or data as yours.  
 
Your blood samples will be stored in secured freezers at the CNRM Biorepository.   Your name [CONTACT_420641]; we will assign them a code. The key to the code will be kept in a separate, secure area. Once 
the samples and the code arrive at the CNRM Biorepository, a repository manager will be responsible for maintaining the 
samples and sending them to others who may use the samples for research. The samples will be stored for up to [ADDRESS_530668] it. The CNRM is a federal medical research 
program of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), and DOD is the custodian of the samples. The Uniformed Services 
University (USU) operates the CNRM and the USU IRB reviews the repository for patient protection and receives reports 
from a Biorepository Steering Committee on the operations of the repository.  
 [CONTACT_420644] is responsible for your samples here at NIH and until they are received at [CONTACT_409662]- Arrastia’s laboratory

Protocol #:17-[ADDRESS_1151074] Title: A randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled parallel study of tolerability and 
efficacy of Cannabidiol (CBD) on motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_127987], MD   
Version Date:   December 17 , 2019         
 I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :  
 
Parkinson disease (PD) is a relatively common, progressive, disabling disorder that responds partially to symptomatic treatments. Since cannabis has become legal in Colorado, many persons with PD have been trying it to see if it relieves any of their symptoms. Cannabis is composed of many cannabinoids, with delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) the major constituent. THC has been 
shown to induce a “high,” psychosis, cognitive dysfunction and anxiety – all of whic h would be 
problematic in PD. Cannabidiol (CBD) is also a component of cannabis, and, according to published reports, has potential beneficial medical uses in PD. However, the literature regarding the use of cannabis in PD is minimal and inconclusive.   There are many forms of cannabis being marketed, which range in potencies of THC and CBD. 
Since CBD is likely to be safer and more beneficial than THC, our study drug is primarily CBD, i.e., CBD:THC is 30:1. The dose used will deliver an amount of THC too low to cause a “high .” 
 
The major purpose is to assess the effect of CBD on motor symptoms in PD, and secondarily to study 
its safety , tolerability , and effect on other motor and non-motor symptoms that occur frequently in 
PD. This  is a parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 60 participants.   
Our Hypotheses  are:  
1. CBD has a significant treatment effect on PD motor symptoms.  
2. CBD  is safe and tolerated in PD.  
3. CBD has some beneficial effect on other conditions that occur in PD, including tremor, night-
time sleep, rigidity, emotional control, anxiety, pain, cognition, psychosis, and other motor and non-motor related PD signs . 
4. Plasma  cytokine levels (Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-2,4,6) elevate in PD 
and are neurotoxic during the progress of PD. CBD has some beneficial effect on reducing cytokine levels in PD. 
Our Specific Aims  are: 
Primary Specific Aim:  To evaluate the efficacy of CBD on motor symptoms in PD, specifically on 
the motor section of the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS- UPDRS).  
4 
 Secondary Specific Aim:  To assess the safety and tolerability of CBD in PD and to examine the 
effect of CBD on severity and  duration of intractable tremor, night- time sleep, rigidity, emotional 
dyscontrol, anxiety, and pain in PD. 
Exploratory Analyses:    
To study the efficacy of CBD on cognition, psychosis, sleep, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], mood, fatigue, 
impulsivity, bladder function, other motor and non-motor PD signs, restless legs syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder and quality of life.  To explore the effect of CBD on plasma  levels of cytokines in PD. 
 
II. Background and Significance :  
Parkinson disease 
Persons with PD have progressive disabling tremor, slowness, stiffness, balance impairment, cognitive deficits, psychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, and insomnia. Tremor may interfere with necessary daily and work functions. The disorder affects approximately seven million people globally [Yao, S.C, et al. 2013; de Lau LM, et al. 2006]. The total economic cost in the US is around 23 billion dollars [Findley LJ. 2007]. In addition to economic costs, PD reduce s quality of life 
of those affected and their caregivers.  
 Cognitive impairment is a common feature and ranges from delayed recall in early stages to global dementia in up to 80% at end stage. PD with dementia has been associated with reduced quality of life [Schrag A, et al. 2000], shortened survival [Nussbaum M, et al. 1998], and increased caregiver distress [Aarsland D, et al. 1999]. Community-based studies have estimated the point prevalence for dementia in PD to be 28% and 44% [Mayeux R, et al. 1992; Aarsland D, et al. 1996; Hobson P, et al. 2004; Marttila RJ, et al. 1976].  Depression, anxiety, and psychosis are also common and are particularly disabling in PD, even at the earliest stages. These symptoms have important consequences for quality of life and daily functioning, and are associated with increased career  burden and risk for nursing home admission. 
Anxiety affects up to 40% of patients with PD [Menza MA, et al. 1993; Richard IH. 2005; Leentjens AF, et al. 2008; Stein MB, et al. 1990; Nuti A, et al. 2004; Lauterbach EC, et al. 2004; Aarsland D, et al. 2009], and may predate motor symptoms by [CONTACT_72623]. The most common anxiety disorders in PD are panic attacks (often during off-periods), generalized anxiety disorder, and simple and social phobias. Psychotic symptoms vary in frequency according to the definition used. If mild forms are included, these affect up to 50% of patients [Aarsland D, et al. 2009, Soulas T, et al. 2008]. Visual hallucinations are the most common type. However, hallucinations occur in all sensory domains and delusions of various types are also relatively common. The impact of psychosis is substantial in that it is associated with dementia, depression, earlier mortality, greater caregiver strain, and nursing home placement.  Thus, it is crucial to treat these symptoms in order to optimize the management of 
PD patients.   In PD the levels of various cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)- 1beta, IL -
2, IL- 4, IL -6, epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF), transformi ng growth factor (TGF)- alpha, TGF -beta1) 
were found significantly increased in the striatum of the postmortem brain and in ventricular or spi[INVESTIGATOR_590118] [Nagatsu T, et al. 2000]. Cytokines may be initially neuroprotective, but may later become neurotoxic during the progress of PD [Sawada M, et al. 2006].   
[ADDRESS_1151075] problematic adverse effects [Poewe W. 2006].   
Cannabis use in PD 
Since treat ment of PD is often unsatisfactory and since cannabis has recently become legal and 
readily available in Colorado, persons with PD have been trying it. Patients have heard from the internet, support groups, and other sources that marijuana is helpful. Most are doing so on their own, without the supervision or even knowledge of their neurologist. In a survey conducted in the spring of 2014 in University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829502] 5% of 207 PD patients, average age 69, reported using  cannabis [Finseth TA. et al. 2015]. In another study Katerina 
Venderova and colleagues reported that 25% of PD patients had taken cannabis in the General University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_550271] [Venderova K, et al. 2004]. In our clinics, about 30% of the PD patient s have asked doctors during their clinic visits over the past six months about cannabis. In an 
anonymous web-based survey, 72% PD patients reported current or past use of medical cannabis, and 48% reported reducing prescription medication since beginning cannabis use [Kindred, et al. 2017].    PD mostly affects the elderly, and affected persons often have cognitive, psychiatric, and motor problems, such as being prone to falling. Cannabis is well documented to cause psychosis, anxiety, slowness, and incoordination. Studies have also shown that chronic users have structural and functional CNS alterations [Sneider  JT., et al. 2013; Matochik JA. , et al. 2005; Jager G. , et al. 2010; 
James A, et al. 2011; Battistella  G., et al. 2014; Gruber SA. , et al. 2005; Stone JM. , et al. 2012]. Thus 
cannabis is expected to be risky in persons with PD. Further, there are many components of cannabis, and the cannabis preparations being sold in Colorado vary widely in composition. There are no definitive data regarding the benefits and risks in of these various preparations in PD. Studies on safety and efficacy are greatly needed to protect this fragile Colorado population.  
THC vs. CBD  
Many clinicians who suspect cannabis may have a positive effect upon a particular patient group do not know the cannabinoid profile that is being used. Without knowing the composition, it is impossible to draw any conclusions simply because of the huge variety of strains utilized. CBD is present to a lesser extent in street marijuana, and has been shown to limit THC’s so called “psychoactive” effect [Bhattacharryya S et al, 2010; Hayakawa K, et al. 2008; Atakan Z. 2012], meaning the “high.”   
 CBD acts in some experimental models as an anti -inflammatory, anticonvulsant, anti -oxidant, anti-
emetic, anxiolytic , and antipsychotic agent, and therefore has potential beneficial medical uses 
[Zhornitsky S, et al. 2012; Crippa JA, et al. 2011; Iuvone T, et al. 2009; Vuolo F, et al. 2015]. Further, animal studies suggest that CBD is neuroprotective, perhaps due to reported anti-oxidative [Lastres -Becker I, et al. 2005; García-Arencibia M et al. 2007; Hayakawa K, et al. 2007] and anti-
inflammatory actions [Mecha M, et al. 2013]. The ratio of THC to CBD plays a role in the preparation ’s therapeutic outcome: strains of cannabis with higher concentrations of CBD did not 
produce short- term memory impairment vs. strains with similar concentrations of THC, but lower 
concentrations of CBD [Englund A et al. 2013]. THC is associated with psychosis, cognitive impairment, anxiety , and psychomotor slowing [Hall W., et al. 1998, Hindocha C., et al. 2017]. 
Thus, CBD has likely beneficial effects in PD, but THC may have harmful effects.  
[ADDRESS_1151076] notably, 7-hydroxy- CBD and CBD -7-oic acid [Agurell, S. et al. 1986; Harvey, D.J. 1990]. The 
half-life of CBD in humans was found to be between 2–5 days following oral administration. 
Bioavailability of oral CBD in h umans was found to be around 6%, [Agurell, S. et al. 1986; Consroe, 
P. et al. 1991; Ohlsson, A. et al. 1986; Guy, GW. et al. 2004]. Oral administration of CBD (~700 mg) over six weeks to 14 Huntington’s disease patients resulted in a low, narrow plasma range of 5.9–11.2 ng/mL [Consroe, P. et al. 1991].   
Literature review of studies of cannabis in neurological disorders, especially PD  
The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Guideline Development Subcommittee performed a systematic review of medical marijuana to address treatment of symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and movement disorders [Koppel BS, et al. 2014]. In patients with MS, oral cannabis extract is effective, and nabiximols  (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals, 1:1 ratio of CBD to THC, with a 
fixed dose of 2.7 mg THC and 2.5 mg CBD) and THC are probably effective for spasticity, central pain, or painful spasms; nabiximols is probably effective for reducing bladder voids/day. Oral 
cannabis extract is probably ineffective for treating levodopa- induced dyskinesia in patients with PD. 
Oral forms of cannabis are of unknown efficacy in non-chorea-related symptoms of Huntington disease, Tourette syndrome, cervical dystonia, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
 
A few studies have been reported that tested varied cannabis co mpositions in PD. A Class I double-
blind crossover study examined the effectiveness of an extract of cannabis sativa standardized to 2.5 mg of Δ
9 -THC and 1.25 mg of cannabidiol per capsule in the treatment of levodopa-induced 
dyskinesias in 19 patients [Carroll CB, et al. 2004] and concluded that cannabis is probably ineffective. Note that the CBD dose used was very low. In an open-label observational study, [ADDRESS_1151077] of cannabis on motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. There was significant improvement of sleep and pain scores. No significant adverse effects of the drug were observed [Lotan I, et al. 2014]. An anonymous questionnaire sent to all PD patients attending the Prague Movement Disorder Centre revealed that 85 (25%) out of 339 respondents had taken cannabis and 39 patients (45.9%) described mild or substantial alleviation of their PD symptoms in general, 26 (30.6%) improvement of rest tremor, 38 (44.7%) alleviation of bradykinesia, 32 (37.7%) alleviation of muscle rigidity, and 12 (14.1%) improvement of L-dopa-induced dyskinesias. Only 4 patients (4.7%) reported that cannabis actually worsened their symptoms [Venderová K, et al. 2004]. In another study, five patients with PD and severe tremor were given marijuana smoked as a cigarette in addition to other medications, including diazepam, levodopa/carbidopa and apomorphine. None of the patients experienced relief or demonstrated improvement of tremor  following marijuana [Frankel 
J.P., et al. 1990].  Also, a few studies have been reported that tested CBD in PD. In a double-blind trial [Chagas MH, et al. 2014], 21 PD patients without dementia or comorbid psychiatric conditions were assigned to three groups of seven participants each who were treated with placebo, CBD 75 mg/day or CBD 300 
mg/day for six weeks. The study found significant improvements in measures of functioning and well-being of PD patients treated with CBD 300 mg/day compared to a group t hat received placebo, 
with no psychiatric comorbidities. In another study, six PD patients with psychosis symptoms for at least three months were recruited in an open- label pi[INVESTIGATOR_127995], tolerability , 
7 
 and safety of CBD on PD patients who had psychosis. All patients received CBD in flexible doses 
(start ing with an oral dose of 150 mg/day) for four weeks, in addition to their usual therapy. The 
psychotic symptoms showed a significant decrease under CBD treatment. CBD did not worsen the motor function and decreased the total scores of the UPDRS. No adverse effect was observed during the treatment [Zuardi A.W., et al. 200 9].  
 
Literature review of safety and tolerability of CBD  
There are more than [ADDRESS_1151078] physiological parameters (heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature), a ffect gastrointestinal transit, or alter psychomotor or psychological functions 
[Zuardi AW, et al. 2009; Riedel G, et al. 2009; Scopi[INVESTIGATOR_127996], et al. 2011; Gomes FV, et al. 2013; Bergamaschi MM, et al. 2011; Bhattacharyya S, et al. 2010]. Also, chronic use and high doses up to 1,500 mg/day of CBD are reportedly well tolerated in humans [Zuardi AW, et al. 1995]. Conversely, some studies reported that this cannabinoid has adverse effects, including inhibition of hepatic drug metabolism, alterations of in vitro cell viability, and decreased fertilization capacity [Bergamaschi MM, et al. 2011; Bornheim LM, et al. 1994; Narimatsu S, et al. 1990],  Extensive reports of CBD administration across a wide range of concentrations did not detect important adverse or toxic effects [Bergamaschi MM, et al. 2011]. With a median Lethal Dose (LD50) of 212 mg/kg in rhesus monkeys, CBD has a low toxicity [Rosenkrantz H, et al. 1981]. Some studies investigated mutagenic or teratogenic effects and describe no such events [Matsuyama SS, Fu TK. 1981; Dalterio S, et al. 1984]. We reviewed the tolerability of CBD doses used in human studies to date – one study suggested over 300 mg per day may exacerbate bradykinesia [Consroe P, et al. 1986], but other studies used 7.5 to 1500 mg per day without significant adverse effects [Bergamaschi MM, et al. 2011; Zuardi AW, et al. 1995]. Most studies used doses in the range of 200 - 600 mg/day.   
Summary  
Human trials report that CBD decreases anxiety and causes sedation in healthy individuals, decre ases 
psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia [Zuardi AW, et al, 2006; Leweke FM et al. 2012] and PD [Zuardi AW, et al. 2009], and improves motor and non-motor symptoms and alleviates levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD [Venderova K. , et al. 2004; Lotan I, et al. 2014; Chaqas MH, et al. 2014; 
Zuardi AW, et al. 2009] . Given the current literature regarding CBD ’s possible neuroprotective 
effect, good tolerability, anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects and general lack of information in PD, including its effect on tre mor, we feel that it is important to study its use in PD further. We 
hypothesized that it would reduce tremor, anxiety, and psychosis, and would be well tolerated in PD.  
 III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:  
 
Rationale of study design 
With the long term goal of determining the safety and effects of CBD in PD, we designed our study to be conducted in two stages: an open label dose escalation study, to be followed by [CONTACT_829533], randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled study (RCT). H ere we provide 
a progress report that describes result of the open label study, and how the findings shape the design of the randomized, controlled parallel study.  
[ADDRESS_1151079] a study drug was needed: 
• We wanted a pure CBD product (as pure as possible) so that the results of the study could be assumed to be strictly from the CBD - not from THC, not from other cannabis components, and 
not from the “entourage’ effect. Also, we did not want to expose patients to the presumed risks of THC, described in the Background and  Significance, THC vs. CBD section.   
• Since w e would need to get an IND from the FDA the study drug would need to be of consistent 
good quality, made with good manufacturing processes (GMP).  
• We wanted an oral preparation, since smoking was not healthy and vaporization would be 
challenging for PD patients. Also it would be harder to give precise doses via smoking and 
vaporization compared to oral. Further the oral route has longer a half- life so  we could achieve a 
steady state with twice daily administration for a number of days that is feasible for this study.  
 
The usual source of cannabis for study in the US is the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), but 
only material with THC and with a CBD:THC ratio that was too low was available. Also, only plant material was available, which would need to be taken via smoking or vaporization.  GW Pharmaceuticals was conducting Phase III trials with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
®, a 99% pure CBD preparation, 
in pediatric e pi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]® was a good choice for our study because it had <0.1% THC, and the 
FDA already had the data it would require for an IND for use in our PD study. Further, it was an oil based solution that could be readily taken by [CONTACT_829534], and ther e existed reasonable data on 
dosing. GW was finding Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
® to be tolerated and beneficial in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_829503] 20-25 mg/kg/day. GW agreed to supply Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]® at no cost. 
 
We based our titration schedule and dosage on the dose that GW was finding to be effective in reducing seizures in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Here we present the design and findings of the first stage study. 
 
Overview of open label dose-escalation study goals and methodology 
We conducted a Phase IIa, open label dose -escalation tolerability study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in 13 PD 
patients at the University of Colorado between October 2016 and June 2017, using Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]®. The 
primary outcome was safety and tolerability, measured by [CONTACT_20721], changes in examinations, labs, EKGs and percentage of participants that discontinued study drug due to intolerability. The major secondary outcome measure was change in the total of two items on rest tremor in the MDS-UPDRS, and others were measures of most motor and non- motor symptoms th at occur in PD. 
Participants had a screening visit, a baseline visit within the next three weeks, a final dose assessment visit when they have been on the maximal tolerated or the targeted study dose for 10-15 days, and a safety visit 2 weeks later. From the baseline visit, qualified participants took Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
® 
in a [ADDRESS_1151080] in the pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_67513], and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
® had not been used in persons over 
age 50, we elected to be cautious and instructed participants not to drive while on study drug. 
 
CBD was started at 5 mg/kg/day and the dose could be increased or decreased by [CONTACT_8622] 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day until the study participants reached a maximum targeted dose (20-25 mg/kg/day) or experienced intolerable adverse events (AEs), in which case the dose would be dropped to the last 
[ADDRESS_1151081] of CBD on severity and duration of tremor and other conditions that occur in PD.  
Results  
Figure 1 shows the trial profile. Data from all participants that took the study drug were analyzed for safety and tolerability, while only data from those that completed a final dose assessment were analyzed for efficacy. Table 1 shows the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics of safety and efficacy analysis groups.  Figure 1 . Open label study profile

The demographics show that, in general, the participants had an age of onset consistent with the 
general population of persons with PD and they had early to early- middle stage PD. Generally they 
had mild bilateral motor symptoms, walked without assistance,  had disease for six years , and 
required a relatively low dose of medication for their motor symptoms. An entry criteria required them to have a relatively significant tremor, but it would be a resting tremor and thus as a general group these participants likely had very little disability. These participants had scored in the normal range on the entry cognitive screening test.    The original protocol was that participants start at 5 mg/kg/day and titrate up to 25 mg/kg/day. Participants were to remain on each dose for three days, until the maximal tolerated dose was 
reached, and they were to be on that dose for 10-[ADDRESS_1151082] five enrolled participants and the recommendations of the two PharmD s in our study, the protocol was changed to a slower titration and the maximal targeted dose 
was reduced from 25 to 20 mg/kg/day, since December 2016. There had been increased AEs and no evidence of additional benefit in the five participants beyond 20 mg/kg/day. Therefore, participants started at 5 mg/kg/day and increased every three to five d ays by 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day until reaching a 
maximal targeted dose (20 mg/kg/day) or experiencing intolerable adverse effects.   The mean maximum CBD dose was 19.23 mg/kg/day (SD 5.44) in the safety analysis group and 20.25 mg/kg/day (SD 3.43) in the efficacy analysis group. The average length of time (SD) on study drug was 26.8 (8.0) days in safety group and 28.5 (3.4) days in efficacy group.  AEs were reported in 1 3 (100%) of participants, and are shown in Table 2.

AEs were transient, and mild on average. Diarrhea, which increased with increasing doses: 1/13 (8%) 
at 5 mg/kg/day, 5/10 (50%) at 20 mg/kg/day, and 3/3 (100%) at 25 mg/kg/day, may be related to the increasing amount of sesame oil consumed at higher doses. There were no serious adverse events.  Elevated liver enzymes occurred in five (38.5%) participants, one symptomatic and four asymptomatic, were all  on 20-25 mg/kg/day, were transient, and resolved after discontinuation of the 
study drug. None were associated with elevated bilirubin or INR, thus suggesting no change in liver function. CBD002, the one symptomatic participant, also had a liver ultrasound, which was normal. The DSMB and a Hepatology consultant reviewed the findings as they occurred and recommended continuing the study with close monitoring.  There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, or physical and neurological exams or labs (complete blood count, renal function and liver function) other than the 
one symptomatic participant with elevated liver enzymes.  
 Three participants (23%) stopped study drug due to intolerability, one due to rash at 5 mg/kg/day, one to abdominal pain and gas at 17.5 mg/kg/day and one to fatigue, diarrhea, and elevated liver enzymes at 25 mg/kg/day.   The efficacy analysis found no change in the designated major secondary outcome, total of two items on rest tremor in the MDS -UPDRS, at the final maximal targeted dose compared with 
baseline. However, there were improvements in some motor signs, Table 3, and some non-motor signs, Table 4.   Table 3. Change in motor scores among efficacy analysis group (n=10)

The other motor and non-motor assessments were not changed – however, parti cipants had very little 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], fatigue, pain, cognitive dysfunction, psychosis, impulsivity, depressed mood, anxiety, levodopa induced dyskinesia, REM sleep behavior disorder, or restless legs syndrome, which often occur in PD. Thus our testing of these symptoms was not meaningful. Interestingly, although participants frequently reported daytime somnolence and fatigue, there was no change on the formal assessments tools.  
 Upon completion of the study each participant and their study partner was interviewed regarding driving. Responses were obtained from 12/[ADDRESS_1151083] couple of days when he started a new higher dose, due to somnolence. No participants reported feeling “high.” No study partners thought the participant got “high” from the study drug.  
Discussion  
The primary outcome was safety and tolerability. Generally, the study drug, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]®, was well 
tolerated. While adverse effects, mainly somnolence, fatigue, and diarrhea, were frequent, they were 
generally mild, and there was a relatively low percent of participants, i.e., 23%, that stopped study drug due to intolerability, and no clinically significant abnormalities in testing except for elevated liver enzymes.  
 Regarding the elevated liver enzymes, GW had seen elevations in their pediatric g roup, but the 
pattern was hepatocellular, not cholestatic as in our population. Perhaps age contributed to the difference, since GW had not used Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
® in persons over age 50. In our study liver enzymes 
were only checked on the highest dose and most of the affected participants were asymptomatic, so it is not clear at what dose the liver enzymes became elevated. Lisa Forman, MD, Hepatologist, reviewed detailed information on these participants and of all the liver function results in all participants, c ommented that  the changes may represent early liver injury and felt that with 
close monitoring it was reasonable to move on with the next study. She will be a consultant on the randomized controlled parallel study.  The DSMB also reviewed all the data and noted that all 
changes resolved with cessation of treatment and discussed the possibility the elevations may be related to medication vehicle, i.e., sesame oil. Most participants were talking [ADDRESS_1151084] benefit to risk ratio, compared to the higher dose that GW reports is useful in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Therefore, a lower dose will be used in the randomized controlled parallel study. 
GW declined to provide Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
® for the randomized controlled parallel study, as they are focused 
on getting FDA approval for it in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. We therefore searched for other study drug 
options. We want to give a dose that provides a reasonable dose of CBD, per the PI’s judgement, and that provides a low enough THC dose so that participants will not get “high.”    The PI ([CONTACT_829561]) considers the following to judge what would be a reasonable dose of  CBD:  
• That is <1/2 of what we were giving on the open label study, i.e., <12.5 mg/kg/day 
• That is at least the minimal amount that persons are likely getting from dispensaries, e.g., 
estimate that a minimal dose some persons see some benefit from would be 1.67 mg/kg/day mg 
pure CBD (if they could get pure CBD); this is based on my experience with what patients tell me they feel when they take specific products  
• that is in the range of 100-200 mg/day, since this is the range that [CONTACT_829562] 
has found to be effective based on his experience in a variety of medical illnesses [personal 
communication ] 
 
Several factors need to be considered when determining the minimal dose of THC that will cause a person to feel “high,” including route of delivery, peak and half- life of THC, active metabolite (11 -
OH-THC), co -existing CBD content, participant’s prior cannabis exposure, etc. The maximal oral 
dose of THC one would want to give that would not cause a person to feel high is approximately <5 mg, and varies depending on these many factors. Also the timing of repeated dosing should be ≤ 6 hours, given the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of THC [Raphael Mechoulam, personal communication, 2017; Colorado Department of Revenue, 2015; L.E. Hollister, et al. 1981; Grotenhermen F et al. 2003; Oviedo A et al. 1993].  Another consideration regarding selecting the study drug for the randomized controlled parallel study is that we have to use a study drug that is either from the only approved federal source, i.e., NIDA, or that the FDA has already evaluated and approved for use in clinical trials. Given that we have to complete this study before funding ends, June 2019, our timeframe does not all ow the time 
the FDA would probably needed to ensure any drug that has not yet been evaluated meets its requirements. Further, the DEA has restrictions on what cannabis products can be studied under a given, e.g., [CONTACT_829561]’s, Schedule 1 license.    We con sidered other factors while choosing a study drug to use in the randomized controlled parallel  
study. While Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
® was the best option for our open label dose-escalation study, we recognized 
that a disadvantage of using a pure CBD preparation and such a high dose is that it is different from what persons with PD obtain from local dispensaries. While local dispensaries sell cannabis that is 
[ADDRESS_1151085], e.g., the “entourage” effect, and this interaction may have a meaningful effect, which would not be occurring in Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
® since it is such a pure CBD product. 
 Therefore, we will use a cannabis  extract with 59.3% CBD and 1.96% THC (30:1 CBD:THC) from 
NIDA. We will give 1.25 mg/kg twice daily of CBD and 0.041 mg/kg twice daily of THC. This equals 2.11 mg/kg twice daily (4.22 mg/kg/day) of the NIDA extract. For our average sized PD participant (84 kg) in our prior trial this will be approximately 100 mg CBD and 3.3 mg THC twice daily (morning and evening - > 6 hours apart). Therefore, the THC dose is below the threshold, ~5mg, that is expected to cause a person to feel “high .” The interval of >[ADDRESS_1151086] to overlap/build up. The extract solution will be in a sesame oil formulation, 100 mg/ml of CBD, so the participant would ingest 1 ml (100 mg CBD) twice daily. This much smaller amount of CBD and of oil is expected to be better tolerated, including less likely to cause liver enzyme elevations, than the study drug in the open label study.  In comparison to the open label study, the amount of CBD in this study is less than 15% (19.23/2.5). This dose and the fact that there is a small amount of THC is in the product makes this study drug more similar to what persons are receiving from local dispensaries, although it may generally have a higher in CBD content. Therefore, the results of the study using this product will be more generalizable to the Colorado PD population.  Whether participants should be allowed to drive has been carefully considered: 
• Medical problems (motor and/or cognitive issues) can affect the ability of older adults to drive safely. Persons with PD are permitted to drive until they develop significant motor and/or 
cognitive issues, and this is monitored by [CONTACT_24018].  
• Colorado law prohibits driving while intoxicated with cannabis - because of the “high” produced 
by [CONTACT_829535]. CBD does not produce the high that occurs from THC [Niesink RJ, 2013].  
• The amount of THC in this randomized controlled parallel study is very unlikely to cause any “high” effect.  
• In the open label study participants and their study partners felt participants would have been safe to drive, and that study involved doses of CBD >7 times higher than participants in this 
randomized controlled parallel study will be taking. The only concern was from one participant regarding having somnolence with increases in the dosing. In the randomized controlled parallel 
study the dose will be started and increased only once, and, again, the dosage will be markedly 
lower.  
• Generally, medications that may cause somnolence or CNS adverse effects have warnings 
provided on the packaging. For example, patients who take opi[INVESTIGATOR_829504] a car or operating machinery. Persons are warned not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they know they are tolerating the effects of the medication and know how they will react to it. Patients who take clonazepam, a medication related to 
15 
 diazepam (Valium), are also told not to drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous 
activities until they know how the clonazepam affects them. This labeling was directed by [CONTACT_1622].   
Our study DSMB met October 29, 2017, considered the points above, and suggested that the study 
should include a clear statement that the effects of CBD on driving are not well known, that some users experience significant sedation but the effects vary among individuals, and that participants should not drive until they know how the drug will affect them. The DSMB also asked that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_198623] a systematic assessment of sedation after administration of the first dose of study drug. Therefore, our protocol includes: 
• To help the participant understand how the study drug affects them we will monitor them in clinic. A validated Alertness Scale will be administered before the dose and again when the 
blood level is expected to reach peak – in three hours.   
• We will have the following language in the consent form and will emphasize it verbally: “Whether or not the study drug affects driving ability is not known. You should not drive or operate heavy machinery  while taking study drug.” 
IV. Research  Methods  
A. Outcome Measure(s):  
Primary Specific Aim:  To evaluate the efficacy of CBD on motor symptoms in PD. 
Primary Outcome Measures: Change of MDS- UPDRS Part III (motor examination) from baseline 
to the end of 2.5 mg/kg/day of CBD. MDS- UPDRS Part III assesses the motor signs of PD.  
Secondary Specific Aim:  To examine safety and tolerability of CBD and the effect of CBD on 
severity and  duration of tremor, night-time sleep, rigidity, emotional dyscontrol, anxiety, and pain in 
PD. 
Secondary Outcome Measures :  
1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CBD in PD:  
1.1 By [CONTACT_128048]- related adverse events at each dose level  between the 
two groups (treatment vs. placebo). Adverse events are measured at study visits, starting with 
an open ended question (Do you notice any effects, good or bad, of the study drug?) and followed by a series of yes/no questions regarding adverse effects (including previously reported adverse effects of CBD and general common adverse effects of medications and the hepatotoxicity), and all the effects we hypothesize in the study. For each adverse and beneficial reported effect, further quest ions will be asked, such as when did the effect start 
and how is it progressing, etc. In addition, since a major dose limiting effect is somnolence, the daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_127998]-sleep is included. 
 Tolerability is judged and supervised by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_9814]-I (who are MDs), based on their clinical 
expertise.  
Abuse- related AEs will also be collected at screening, each dose assessment visit, liver 
function monitoring visit, and safety follow up visit. The abuse-related AEs is provided by [CONTACT_223539] (PTs), including: 
Euphoria-related terms: Euphoric mood, elevated mood, feeling abnormal, feeling drunk, feeling of relaxation, dizziness, thinking abnormal, hallucination, inappropriate affect. Terms indicative of impaired attention, cognition, and mood: Somnolence, mood disorders, and disturbances. 
16 
 Dissociative/psychotic terms: Psychosis, aggression, confusion, and disorientation. 
Related terms not captured elsewhere: Drug tolerance, habituation, drug withdrawal syndrome, substance-related disorders. The Abuse- related AEs will be collected and recorded on a CRF that includes timing of the 
event, duration, severity, indication if more than one event was observed simultaneously, if other drugs were taken by [CONTACT_829536], correlatio n between the onset of 
the event , and the use of study drug. 
Well trained i nvestigators will capture and report cases of abuse, misuse, or addiction and 
monitor for drug accountability discrepancies before starting trials. 
1.2 Liver monitoring plan: Liver function tests (including Alk Phos, ALT, AST, GGT, Total Bili) will be tested at each dose during treatment phase. Study participants will be asked to check for symptoms of hepatotoxicity when on study drug. A Hepatology consultant, Lisa Forman, MD., has agreed advise on liver function aspects of the study.   
1.3 By [CONTACT_128063], orthostatic blood pressures, physical exam, EKG, and labs (hematology, complete metabolic profile, and urinalysis) between the two groups. These are collected durin g study visits. 
1.4 By [CONTACT_128050], anxiety, psychosis, sleep, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], alertness, mood, fatigue, pain, impulsivity, suicidality, and motor and non-motor PD signs, restless legs syndrome, REM sleep behavior disorder, and quality of life during study visits. The change from baseline to each dose is compared. The assessment tools are:  
Cognition: 
• MoCA - is designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It 
assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, 
memory, language, visual-constructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation . [Freitas S, et al. 2013]. 
• Cognitive assessment battery: 
Intellectual Functioning Estimate  
1) Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) - Word reading tests are an established 
method of establishing a premorbid estimate of verbal intellectual functioning, which will 
serve as an estimate of premorbid cognitive reserve.  
Attention/Processing Speed/Executive Functioning 2) Grooved Pegboard Test: Manipulative dexterity, including finger speed, is assessed.  3) Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) - The SDMT is a measure of processing speed and working memory that has proven to be sensi tive to cognitive impairment in MS that 
has both oral and written trials (only the oral trial will be administered given the anticipated difficulty patients will have with tremor). Participants are presented with a key at the top of a page pairing unique symbols with single digits. Participants are required to provide the correct digit with symbols that are presented on the rest of the page. The number of correct responses provided in 90 seconds on the oral and written trials, respectively, is recorded.  
4) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) - The PASAT is a more complex measure of processing speed and working memory in which a series of digits is presented to participants at varying intervals (i.e., 2 seconds, 3 seconds). Participants must add each 
[ADDRESS_1151087] responses for each trial is recorded.  
5) Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) - The COWAT is a measure of speeded verbal fluency and word retrieval in which participants are asked to say as many words as they can that begin with each of three letters for 60 seconds. The total number of words generated across all three trials is recorded.  
Memory Functioning 6) Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised (HVLT -R) - The HVLT- R is a measure of 
verbal learning and memory in which participants are asked to learn a 12- item word list 
over three trials (total immediate learning). A delayed free recall trial is administered after 20 minutes, followed by a yes/no recognition trial.  
Visuospatial construction 7) Judgment of Line Orientation (JOLO) - The JOLO is test of visuospatial functioning which measures a person's ability to match the angle and orientation of lines in space. Patients are asked to match two angled lines to  a set of [ADDRESS_1151088] and separated 18 degrees from each other.  
Language Functioning  
8) Semantic Verbal Fluency – Semantic Verbal fluency is a measure of speeded verbal fluency and word retrieval in which participants are asked to say as many animal names/fruits and vegetables for 60 seconds. The total number of words generated across all three trials is recorded.  
 
Anxiety: 
• Anxiety short form - is component of the Neurol-QOL (Quality of Life in Neurological 
Disorders) Measurem ent System, which is a collaborative effort of the National Institute 
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and a number of partnering institutions. This 
measurement system was designed to be responsive to the needs of researchers in a variety of neurologic al disorders and to facilitate comparisons of data across clinical trials 
in different diseases. The short form is comprised of eight items that were selected from 
the respective item bank. Items have five response options (e.g., 1=Never, 2=Rarely, 
3=Somet imes, 4=Often, 5=Always). Respondents generally can answer five questions per 
minute.  
Psychosis: 
• Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) - is a valid and reliable scale. It was developed to 
provide a means of assessing neuropsychiatric symptoms and psychopathology of 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. It has proven to be sensitive to change and has been employed to capture treatment related behavioral. The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_829505] a caregiver/significant other who has detailed knowledge of the participant’s behavior. 
Sleep and  daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]:  
• Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson’s disease (SCOPA)sleep - is a valid, reliable, short 
scale for assessing nighttime sleep (NS) and daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (DS) in patients with PD 
[Marinus J,  et al. 2003]. The SCOPA-Sleep consists of two parts. The NS subscale 
addresses sleep problems and includes five items with four response options. Participants 
[ADDRESS_1151089] to indicate how much they were bothered by [CONTACT_128051], ranging 
from 0 (not a t all) to 3 (a lot). The five items address sleep initiation, sleep fragmentation, 
sleep efficiency, sleep duration, and early wakening. The maximum score of this scale is 15, with higher scores reflecting more severe sleep problems. One additional question evaluates overall sleep quality on a 7 -point scale. The DS subscale evaluates daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_128000], ranging from 0 (never) to 3 
(often). Participants indicate how often they fell asleep unexpectedly, fell a sleep in 
particular situations, how often they had difficulty staying awake, and whether falling 
asleep in the daytime was considered a problem. The maximum score is 18, with higher scores reflecting more severe sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. The average score for PD is 5.2 ± 4 for DS and 4.9 ± 4 for NS. 
• Stanford Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS): The Stanford Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_829506] a quick and easy way 
to assess how alert the participant is feeling. SSS is validated and probably the most 
widely used instrument for the assessment of participant’s sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] [Maclean AW,  et al. 
1992, Hoddes et al, 1972].  
Mood: 
• Depression short form - is a component of the Neurol- QOL (Quality of Life in 
Neurological Disorders) Measurement System, which is a collaborative effort of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and a number of partnering institutions. This measurement system was designed to be responsive to the needs of researchers in a variety of neurological disorders and to facilitate comparisons of data across clinical trials in different diseases. The short form is comprised of eight items that were selected from the respecti ve item bank. Items have five response options (e.g., 
1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, 4=Often, 5=Always). Respondents generally can 
answer five questions per minute. 
• Emotional and behavioral dyscontrol short form - is a component of the Neurol- QOL 
Measurem ent System, which is a collaborative effort of the National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke and a number of partnering institutions. This 
measurement system was designed to be responsive to the needs of researchers in a variety of neurologic al disorders and to facilitate comparisons of data across clinical trials 
in different diseases. The short form is comprised of eight items that were selected from the respective item bank. Items have five response options (e.g., 1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Somet imes, 4=Often, 5=Always). Respondents generally can answer five questions per 
minute.  
Fatigue:  
• Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) - is a self -report nine-item questionnaire with questions 
related to how fatigue interferes with certain activities and rates its severity. The items are scored on a seven point scale with 1= strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. The minimum score is 9 and maximum score possible is 63. The h igher the score, the greater 
the fatigue severity.  
Pain:  
• Pain Intensity 3a short form and Pai n Interference 4a short form - are components of the 
Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), which was 
[ADDRESS_1151090] been tested in more than 20,000 individuals drawn from the general US population. The Pain Intensity instrument assesses how much a person hurts. The Pain Interference instrument measures the self -reported consequences of pain 
on relevant aspects of one’s life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders 
engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. Each 
question has five response options ranging in value from one to five.  
Impulsivity: 
• Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease- Rating Scale (QUIP -RS) is a 
rating scale designed to measure severity of symptoms and support a diagnosis of impulse control disorders and related disorders in PD. QUIP -RS has four primary 
questions (pertaining to commonly reported thoughts, urges/desires, and behaviors associated with ICDs), each applied to the four ICDs (compulsive gambling, buying, 
eating, and sexual behavior) and three related disorders (med ication use, punding, and 
hobby[CONTACT_128053]). It uses a five -point Likert scale (score 0 -4 for each question) to gauge the 
frequency of behaviors, and instructs patients to answer questions based on behaviors that occurred in the preceding four weeks (or any four-week period in a designated time frame). Scores for each ICD and related disorder range from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating greater severity (ie, frequency) of symptoms. The total QUIP- RS score for all 
ICDs and related disorders combined ranges from 0 to 112 [Weintraub D, et al. 2012]. 
Suicidality:  
• The Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is a suicidal ideation rating scale. 
It rates an individual’s degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from “wish to be dead” to “active suicidal  ideation with specific plan and intent.” The scale identifies 
behaviors which may be indicative of an individual’s intent to commit suicide. The C-SSRS has been found to be reliable and valid in the identification of suicide risk in several research studies.  
Motor and  non-motor PD signs: 
• Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS- UPDRS) - 
The MDS UPDRS has four parts: Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living), Part II (motor experiences of daily living), Part III (motor examination) and Part IV (motor complications). Part I has two components: IA concerning a number of behaviors that are assessed by [CONTACT_829537], but 
independently of the investigator. It can, however, be reviewed by [CONTACT_829538]. Part II is designed to be a self- admi nistered questionnaire like Part IB, but 
can be reviewed by [CONTACT_128056]. Part III has instructions for the rater to give or demonstrate to the patient; it is completed by [CONTACT_29975]. Part IV has instructions for the rater and also instructions to be read to the patient. This 
20 
 part integrates patient -derived information with the rater’s clinical observations and 
judgments and is completed by [CONTACT_29975].  
• Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) is developed to evaluate involuntary 
movements often associated with treated Parkinson’s disease. There are two primary 
sections: Historical [Part 1 (On -Dyskinesia) and Part 2 (Off-Dystonia)] and Objective 
[Part 3 (Impairment) and Part 4 (Disability)]. On -Dyskinesia refer s to the choreic and 
dystonic movements described to the patient as “jerking or twisting movements that occur 
when your medicine is working.” Off-Dystonia should be described to the patient as “spasms or cramps that can be painful and occur when your Parki nson’s disease 
medications are not taken or are not working.” 
• Timed Up&Go (TUG)  test: The TUG test is a validated, widely used test for evaluating 
balance and walking ability associated with advancing age, neurological (especially PD) , 
or other disorders [Bohannon RW, et al. 2006].  
• Non-motor symptoms Scale for Parkinson’s disease (NMSS): NMSS is a validated 30-
item scale for the assessment of NMS in PD. NMSSS contains nine dimensions: cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems, attention/memory, gastrointestinal, urinary, sexual function, and miscellany. 
Restless Legs Syndrome: 
• International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale for restless legs syndrome (IRLS): IRLS is a ten-question instrument for measuring severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS). The scale reflects participants assessment of the primary features (reflected in questions 1 through 3 and 6 of the scale), intensity and frequency of the disorder (questions 7 and 8 of the scale) and associated sl eep problems (reflected in 
questions 4 and 5 of the scale). The scale also includes questions which probe the impact of symptoms on the patients’ mood and daily functioning (question 9 and 10 of the scale). Each question has a set of five response options graded from no RLS or impact (score=0) to very severe RLS or impact (score=4). This produced a total scale whose overall score could range from 0 to 40. IRLS sum score and subscales (symptoms in questions 1, 2, 4, and 6 through 8; symptoms impact in questions 5, 9, and 10) at every time point will be recorded. Item 3 is used for the total score for overall RLS severity. 
REM Sleep Behavior Disorders: 
• REM sleep behavior disorder screening questionnaire (RBDSQ) – is a 10 -item, patient 
self-rating instrument as sessing the participant’s sleep behavior with short questions that 
have to be answered by [CONTACT_5640] “yes” or “no”. Items 1 to 4 address the frequency and content of dreams and their relationship to nocturnal movements and behavior. Item 5 asks about self- injuries and injuries of the bed partner. Item 6 consists of four sub items 
assessing nocturnal motor behavior more specifically, e.g., questions about nocturnal vocalization, sudden limb movements, complex movements, or bedding items that fell down. Items 7 and 8 deal with nocturnal awakenings. Item 9 focuses on disturbed sleep in 
general and item 10 on the presence of any neurological disorder. The maximum total 
score of the RBDSQ is 13 points. 
Bladder function: 
21 
 • Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) is a validated self -administered 
questionnaire consisting of seven questions on a five-point Likert scale. Five questions 
are related to urinary urgency and two are related to daytime and nighttime urinary 
frequency.  
Quality of Life  
• Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ -39): is a reliable, valid, responsive, acceptable, 
and feasible as the tool for the assessment of quality of life in Parkinson’s disease 
patients. There are 39 questions in the long form Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire, with eight discrete scal es: mobility (10 items), activities of daily living ( six items), emotional 
well-being (six items), stigma ( four items), social support ( three items), cognitions ( four 
items), communication ( three items), and bodily discomfort ( three items). Patients are 
asked to think about their health and general well-being and to consider how often in the last month they have experienced certain events. Patients are asked to indicate the frequency of each event by [CONTACT_136596] (L ikert Scale): 
never/occasionally/sometimes/often/always or cannot do at all.  
• EuroQoL-5 Dimension- 5 level (EQ -5D-5L): consists of two pages -the EEQ -5D- 5L 
descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problem, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. This is a widely used well validated simple assess ment that is comparable across disease populations. 
1.5 By [CONTACT_829539] (treatment vs. placebo). 
2. Overall PD status - Change of total MDS UPDRS scores from baseline to the end of 2.5 
mg/kg/day visit. 
3. Tremor - Change of Severity and duration of tremor from baseline to the end of 2.5 mg/kg/day visit: Tremor is measured by [CONTACT_829540] 2.5 mg/kg/day between the two groups: 
3.1 Total of scores on items 3.17 and 3.18 in part III of the MDS- UPDRS in the ON state (when 
anti-PD medication is working). Item 3.[ADDRESS_1151091] tremor amplitude. Extremity ratings range 
from 0: Normal, No tremor to 4: Severe, >10 cm in maximal amplitude. Lip/Jaw ratings are similar but smaller amplitudes. Item 3.[ADDRESS_1151092] tremor: 0 (no tremor) to 4 (present >75% of the exam). 
3.2 Item 2.10 in part II of the MDS- UPDRS in the ON state. Item 2.10 is patient’s tremor 
experience: 0 (Not at all. I have no shaking or tremor) to 4 (Shaking or tremor causes problems with most or all activities).  
3.3 Total of scores on items 3.15 and 3.16 in part III of the MDS -UPDRS in the ON state. Item 
3.15 is postural tremor of the hands: 0: Normal (No tremor) to 4: Severe (Tremor is at least 10 cm in amplitude). Item 3.16 is kinetic tremor of the hands: 0: Normal (No tremor) to 4: Severe (Tremor is at least 10 cm in amplitude).  
3.4 Constancy and amplitude of tremor measured by [CONTACT_829541]: Tremor 
will be measured at clinic and at home (twice a day, two hours after breakfast dose and two hours after dinner dose, for 2 consecutive days after screening visit,  three consecutive days 
before baseline visit and each dose assessment visit). Each time tremor will be measured for 
22 
 90 seconds. The constancy (percentage of tremor per minutes) and amplitude will be 
recorded using the package. See Appendix 2. [CONTACT_829563] is collaborating on the tremor device.  
4. Motor sub- scores - Rigidity, bradykinesia, axial, and bulbar sub- scores will also be calculated –

7. Pain - Pain intensity short form score change from baseline to the end of 2.5 mg/kg/day visit. 
8. Sleep sub-study- The primary outcome is the change from baseline to the end of 2.5 mg/kg/day visit on wake after sleep onset (WASO, length of periods of wakefulness occurring after sleep onset), secondary outcomes are changes from baseline to the end of 2.5 mg/kg/day visit on: percentage of total sleep time spent in each sleep stage (N1, N2, N3, and REM), frequency of leg movements during REM, sleep efficiency (proportion of total time in bed spent asleep), total sleep time and the scales of SCOPA -night- time sleep, ISI, DBAS -16, and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8326].

8.2 Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): ISI is a verified seven -item self -report questionnaire assessing 
the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. A five -point Likert scale is used to rate each 
item (e.g., 0=no problem; 4=very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0- 7); sub -threshold 
insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28). 
8.3 Modified Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Questionnaire (DBAS-16): A 
validated self -reported questionnaire designed to identify and assess various sleep/insomnia-
related cognitions (e.g., beliefs, attitudes, expectations, appraisals, attributions). 
8.4 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]: is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and 
patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates “poor” from “good” sleep quality by [CONTACT_629657]: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133527], and daytime dysfunction over the last month. 
8.5 Home Sleep Monitoring: Polysomnography (PSG) will be performed using a Type II 
portable, unattended monitor in patients’ home. Study subjects will come to clinic to have electrodes and equipment attached by [CONTACT_829542] (EEG), electro -oculogram (EOG: bilateral), electrocardiogram (EKG), chin electromyogram (EMG), 
abdominal and thoracic effort belts, oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2; finger pulse oximetry; Nonin, Minneapolis, Minnesota), airflow (oral- nasal thermistor) , and pressure transducer. 
Explicit instructions will be reviewed with each subject prior to leaving clinic: directions, timing for completing each questionnaire and initiating sleep recording. A registered polysomnographic technologist (PRSGT) will download and inspect the quality of the recorded signal of the PSG prior to scoring the data. Drs. Russell Bowler and Greg Kinney are collaborating on conduct of the polysomnogra ms.

Exploratory Analyses: 
To study the efficacy of CBD on the aspects of PD listed in Section IV, 1.4 and plasma  levels of 
cytokine in PD.  
Exploratory Outcome Measures:  The efficacy of CBD on  these aspects of PD are measured by [CONTACT_829543] (listed in Section IV, 1.4). The effect of CBD is also measured by [CONTACT_123260] (CGI) and Patient Global Impression-improvement (PGI-I) and Change (PGI -C). CGI is a three -item observer -rated scale that measures illness severity 
(CGIS), global improvement or change (CGIC) and therapeutic response. The CGI is rated on a seven -point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) 
through to 7 (amongst the more severely ill patients). CGI-C scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse). Treatment response ratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacy and treatment -related adverse events and range from 0 (marked improvement 
and no side-effects) and 4 (unchanged or worse and side- effects outweigh the therapeutic effects). 
Each component of the CGI is rated separately. PGI -I is a global index that may be used to rate the 
response of a condition to a therapy (transition scale). It is a simple, direct, easy to use scale that is intuitively understandable to patients. PGI- C is rated on a seven -point scale, evaluating all aspects of 
patient’ health and determining if there has been an improvement or not. The change from baseline 
to the end of 2.5 mg/kg/day is compared between the two groups. 
Change of plasma  levels of cytokine from baseline to the end of 2.5 mg/kg/day will be compared 
between the two groups.  Table 5. Measurement tools perf ormed in current study.

 B. Description of Population to be Enrolled:   Parkinson disease - Persons with PD have progressive disabling tremor, slowness, stiffness, balance impairment, cognitive deficits, psychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, and insomnia. Tremor ma y interfere with necessary daily and work functions. The disorder affects approximately 
seven million people globally [Yao, S.C, et al. 2013; de Lau LM, et al. 2006]. PD usually begins around age 60, but it can start earlier. Treatment, typi[INVESTIGATOR_829507], improve early stage symptoms. As the disease progresses and dopaminergic neurons continue to be lost, these drugs become less effective, and levodopa produces disabling motor fluctuations in most patients. PD invariably progresses with time. Untreated individuals are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten 
years [Poewe W. 2006]. In people taking levodopa the progression of symptoms to a stage of high 
dependency from caregivers is on average [ADDRESS_1151094] a clinically significant reduction in MDS UPDRS Part III motor scores. This is a 1:1 parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
with 60 participants. We will be recruiting up to 75 participants; the goal is to have 60 participants (30 in CBD group and 30 in placebo group) complete the study.   QUIP -RS  X X

 See Appendix 1 Schedule of Events for more detail on study design. 
The study drug is obtained from NIDA. How the dose is started and escalated and what target dose is chosen is based on human literature and our open label study, as discussed in Section III under Discussion.   The study is a randomized, placebo controlled, double- blind parallel design with two treatment arms, 
each of approximately 2-3 weeks duration. In the 2-3 week treatment phase participants will start study drug and titrate up to the maximum tolerated or targeted dose (2.5 mg/kg/day of CBD). Each participant will have a screening visit, baseline visit within four weeks, 2 dose assessment visit s 
(1.25 mg/kg/day and 2.5 mg/kg/day), and a safety visit (5 visits total). Participants will be evaluated at each dose level for monitoring adverse events, as well as changes in medical history and concomitant medications. Further, in case CBD alters the reliability of self - report, repeated 
measures will be taken on the third to fifth day at each dose during the clinic visits or at home. The assessments include the assessment of tolerability and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, SCOPA -sleep, 
Anxiety short form, Depression short form, Emotional and behavioral dyscontrol short form, and EQ-5D-5L. Participants are called 3  and 7 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_829508]. At  dose assessment visits, urinary CBD and metabolites will be tested. To maximize 
compliance the coordinator calls the participant to remind them the next day’s clinical visit. To increase compliance with taking study drug, participants will be asked to fill out a diary at home. The diary will be a record of the date and time participants take study drug, dose of the study drug, and adverse and beneficial events. Study drug is dispensed at the baseline visit. Participants will measure their tremor using Tremor GUI MATLAB twice a day ( two hours after breakfast dose and two hours 
after dinner dose) for two consecutive days after screening visit, three consecutive days prior to baseline and each dose assessment visit, as well as during the clinic visits. To evaluate the possible somnolence effect of CBD, participants will be evaluated their alertness before and three hours after they take the study drug at baseline visit.

Participants will be consented that the effects of CBD on driving are not known, that some users experience significant sedation but the effects vary among individuals and that participants should not drive while taking the stu dy drug. A limited amount of Uber vouchers will be provided to 
subjects to assist with transportation needs during the treatment period. Alertness test will be done 
before and three hours after the first dosing is administered at baseline visit to judge th e alertness 
degree for driving.  
Dose escalation strategy:  
Study product (CBD or placebo) will be started at 1.25 mg/kg/day of CBD (once a day) for four days and then increase to 2.5 mg/kg/day of CBD (twice a day) for 10 (+4) days. Tolerability will be assessed at each dose during each clinic visit. Subjects may take a reduced dose for the duration of the study according to the investigator’s medical judgement.  Regarding possible drug interactions, study pharmacists will be provided the calculated dose bas ed 
on body weight, the list of the subject’s medications, and additional relevant clinical information. The final study drug dose will be that recommended by [CONTACT_829544].   
Assessment of tolerability of each dose level  
Tolerability will be assessed at each dose via collection of adverse events and administration of the standardized questionnaires by [CONTACT_829545]. Severity of adverse events will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which is published by [CONTACT_29630] (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH):  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; li miting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADLs. Instrumental ADLs refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care ADLs. Self -care ADLs refer to 
bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
28 
 Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  The protocol for dose adjustments, maintenance, and discontinuation based on adverse effects is as follows: 
• For participants with a grade 1 adverse event the dose will be increased by [CONTACT_8622] 1.25 mg/kg/day, or if they are on the maximal targeted dose (2.5 mg/kg/day) it will be continued.  
• For participants with a grade 2 adverse event the dose will be reduced by 1.25 mg/kg/day or less.  
• For participants with a grade 3 or 4 adverse event that the Investigator determines is unrelated, the dose will be continued. When the adverse event is stabilized or resolved, e.g., participant is 
stable after a hip fracture repair,  the dose will be increased unless they are already on the 
maximum targeted dose.  
• For participants with a grade [ADDRESS_1151097], is somnolence. To monitor for this closely, the daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_829511] -sleep will be administered during each clinic visit, thus before each increase in 
dose. A score of >7 (note that the average score for PD is 5.2 ± 4), if greater than before and considered problematic by [CONTACT_128049], would result in the participant being instructed to drop to the prior dose for five more days before increasing the dose.  Liver function test is done at the study visit on the third  to fifth  day of each dose. Additional 
assessments of safety and tolerability  is done at the study visit when the participant is on the 
maximum tolerated or targeted dose. The same protocol for dosing is applied for both adverse events found during study visits.  The CTCAE criteria are used to determine dose level adjustments and f or participant and study 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (Section IV C.5). Adverse events will be collected and reported as discussed in Section IV C.6.  
Urine collection, storage and transfer for cannabis and metabolites test:  The purpose of the urine 
cannabis and metabol ites test is to develop a methodology to quantitate CBD metabolites. 
Participants will be given two urine cups, 100 mL each, at the baseline visit, 1.25 mg/kg/day dose assessment  visit, and 2.5 mg/kg/day dose assessment visit. Urine cannabis and metabolite s test will 
be done at dose assessment visits (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day) and safety follow up visit. On the phone call before the day of dose assessment visits  and safety follow up visit , participants will be reminded 
to collect urine in the morning of the study visit. They are asked to fill each up at least three -quarters  
full if possible, and to bring them to the visit (no refrigeration needed). Upon arrival of the visit the study coordinator will collect and store the urine cups in a -80°C freezer until shipment. For shipment, samples for each individual will be placed onto a sealable plastic bag together with an absorption pad. All the individual bags will be placed into a large sealable plastic bag with contains absorption material. Samples will be placed  onto a Styrofoam box and will be shipped on dry ice. 
Urine samples will be labeled with the name [CONTACT_829559]. Urine samples will be shipped for analysis to [CONTACT_128090] at iC42 Clinical Research and 
Development. [CONTACT_829564] is in charge of analyzing the specimens as well as contributing to interpreting results and writing publications. He receives only coded specimens with no PHI.

Procedures at each visit  
Visit 1 -Screening visit: Decisional capacity to provide informed consent will be evaluated as much 
as possible during prescreening as well as  at screening visit during informed consent discussion. 
Capacity will be assessed by [CONTACT_829546]: Why is the study being done? What is the 
study asking you to do? What are the risks of the study? Is the study voluntary? Etc. If in PI’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_829512], legally authorized representative (LAR)  will be required to provide informed consent prior to any study procedures being completed.  
Prior to onsite screening visit, the research coordinator sends the consent form to the study participant through email or mail and schedules a time to explain the study and discuss the consent form with the participant via phone Zoom, or other HIPAA- compliant platform. The study 
participant doesn’t need to print the consent or sign the consent. We will finish the consent at on site screening visit with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_54720]- I. If the participant is unable to discuss the consent form in 
advance, consent discussion and review can be done in clinic. On site screening visit: Consent, demographics, concomitant medications,  family medical history, medical history and  physical examination (complete physical exam and detailed neurological exam), 
vital signs, orthostatic blood pressures, tremor evaluation, MDS- UPDRS II I, H&Y rating, MOCA,

profile and Liver Function Tests), blood cannabis analysis testing, plasma  cytokine level tests, serum 
pregnancy test (for women childbearing potential), and inclusion/exclusion criteria are done. Study participa nts are instructed not to take cannabis from outside source throughout the study. Tremor 
constancy and amplitude measure device (Tremor GUI MATLAB package) is dispatched and participants are instructed to use the Tremor GUI MATLAB package to measure their tremors in the clinic and will perform it independently before they leave the clinic. They will measure the tremors at home twice a day ( two hours after breakfast dose and two hours after dinner dose) for two days 
after screening visit and three days prior to the baseline visit.  To reduce in- person clinic visit time , part of the above procedures can be done remotely after onsite 
screening visit, including: demographics, concomitant medications, family medical history, medical history, safety assessments (C -SSRS, NPI, emotional and behavioral dyscontrol short form, drug 
abuse related AEs).

labs (hematology, Complete Metabolic Profile and Liver Function Tests) and blood cannabis analysis, urinalysis, ECG, and urine pregnancy test are done. Study drug compliance check, adverse event check and blinding assessment are done. Participants will take their study drug upon their arrival to the clinic and record the taking time. Blood is drawn for cannabis testing and s afety labs 
three hours after the dose. Participants will be monitored and vital signs and orthostatic blood pressures will be checked at one and three hours (2.5 mg/kg/day dose assessment visit) after taking the study drug. Home diary is collected and revi ewed.  Urine cups dispensed. 
In addition to the procedures above, for Visit 3 (3 -4 days, 1.25 mg/kg/day), participants are told to 
bring in empty, partially used, and unused bottles of study drug at next clinical visit. Participants will be told not to take the study drug on the day of the next visit, as they will take it upon arrival under instruction by [CONTACT_464]. Participants are instructed to measure their tremors at home for three days prior to 2.5 mg/kg/day dose assessment visit. Participants will be given the questionnaires of SCOPA -sleep, Anxiety short form, Depression short form, Emotional and behavioral dyscontrol 
short form, EQ-5D-5L, C- SSRS. Study staff will call the participants on the 3
rd to 5th day on 2.5 
mg/kg/day to  remind them to complete the questionnaires and bring it in at next clinic visit.

For 2.5 mg/kg/day dose assessment visit, participants will pi[INVESTIGATOR_829514], and perform PSG during the night after at least seven  days on the 2.5 mg/kg/day or 
tolerated max dose,  and until (and including) the third  night before the visit . Participants will 
complete Morning Daytime Dysfunction questionnaire and sleep diary on the morning after the sleep test. PSG equipment and data are collected before or at this visit.  Participants will also perform full 
cognitive assessment  battery tests and skin evaluation (DLQI and dermatology photography) during 
this visit. Study drug participants returned are disposed per the SOP at 2.5 mg/kg/day dose 
assessment visit. Plasma  cytokine levels test at 2.5 mg/kg/day visit.

C.2 Study Drug: CBD:  
The study drug is supplied by [CONTACT_133312]; see Appendix 4 for Certificate of Analysis (COA). T he study 
drug (CBD) is provided in the form of a thick liquid and will be diluted into a 100 mg/ml formulation with sesame oil. This procedure will be done by [CONTACT_829547] (Jacci Bainbridge, PharmD, Matthew Makelky, PharmD, and [CONTACT_829565] as a consultant) or PI, according to the protocol we develop with guidance from NIDA and the University of Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_829516] . The placebo will be made by [CONTACT_829548]. Because the placebo may be slightly different in appearance or taste, two study modifications are being done to preserve the blind. First, the study drug will be put into brown opaque bottles and the only study personnel to see the actual study drug will be the unblinded PharmD and the blinded CTRC PA that instructs the subject on how to take study drug. Further, the study drug is administered in a closed, vented room in the CTRC that removes the odor of cannabis within four minutes . After the study drug is administered and the study drug bottle closed, the PA 
will stay with the subject in the closed room while it is being vented for at least 10 minutes. T he 
study design of parallel groups is being used instead of the original crossover design that was planned.  ElSohy Laboratories, Incorporated (ELI) will perform the stability testing. The laboratory is 
registered with the FDA and the DEA (Manufacturing and Analytical), all the planned analytical 
32 
 procedures are validated , and the lab has extensive experience with th e drug substance (CBD 
extract) and with a very similar drug product to ours. Controls for both CBD and THC content are 
used. The stability testing will be done in real time.  The shelf life will be determined by [CONTACT_829549]. The final drug product will be stored at room temperature, 25°C.  The microbial testing for the final drug product will be carried out according to UPS 61 (total aerobic microbial count and total combined yeast/mold count) and USP 62 (for salmonella and E. coli), and the specification and acceptance criteria will be the same as recommended in USP <111> (microbiological examination of non- sterile products: Acceptance Criteria for Pharmaceutical 
Preparations and Substances for Pharmaceutical Use for non-sterile, non-aqueous products with oral administration) . This will be the same for the product and placebo. 
Microbial Specifications:  • Route of Administration: Nonaqueous preparations for oral use. • Total Aerobic Microbial Count:<103 cfu/mL • Total Combined Yeasts/Molds Count: <102 cfu/mL • Specified Microorganism(s): Absence of Escherichia coli (1 g or 1 mL) The CBD extract will be shipped and stored frozen. The final drug product will be prepared within [ADDRESS_1151100] in 60 ml amber bottles and take it orally for up to 20 days. The stability study will be carried out only at room temperature at the following time points: 0, [ADDRESS_1151101] and 
placebo and again at the end of one month to show that no change in bioburden occurred during the one month storage at room temperature. Three manufacturing batches will be prepared (validation lots). These will be subjected to analysis to show consistency of the manufacturing process. The analytical specification will be that the analytical value should be within 10% of the nominal concentration (i.e. 100 mg CBD/ml should analyze for 90-110 mg/ml). The analytical method is validated for Linearity, LOD, LOQ, accuracy and precision for both CBD and THC. The specification for the drug product will be:  
Appearance: Greenish -yellowish brown, oily solution 
Potency: CBD Concentration = 100mg/mL = 10% solution; ±10% variation in measured potency (90 to 110 mg/mL) is allowed due to manufacturing and analytical variation.  Other Cannabinoids: • THC not greater than 5 mg/mL (0.5% solution) • CBD:THC ratio not less than 20:1  We will provide the FDA with a final report with statistical analysis.  
We will prepare oral solution of 100 mg/ml CBD (10% CBD) and 3.31 mg/ml THC (0.33% THC) in [ADDRESS_1151102] weighs. • [ADDRESS_1151103] oral solution filled: Each bottle will have [ADDRESS_1151104] placed in it (3000 mg CBD), filled to 30 mL mark with sesame oil.  
• [ADDRESS_1151105] oral solution filled: Each bottle will have [ADDRESS_1151106] placed in it (4000 mg CBD), filled to 40 mL mark with sesame oil. Dosage Form and Strength 
33 
 Pre-dilution dosage unit: CBD Cannabis Extract (depending on the subject’s weight it will contain 
either 3 or 4 gms CBD) 
Diluted Unit: CBD Cannabis Oral Solution (100mg/ml CBD)  
 The FDA has approved our IND. T he DEA has  approved the PI’s amended DEA Schedule 1 license.  
Participants will be given bottles with 30/40 ml of study drug, at concentration of 100 mg/ml CBD or placebo and instructed how to take it. The study drug is best taken fasted, as food will increase Cmax and delay Tmax. The study drug could be taken with a small amount of food as needed if t he 
participants experience nausea. The s tudy drug will be taken orally, started at 1.25 mg/kg/day of 
CBD, once daily in the morning for four days, then increased to 2.5 mg/kg/day, twice daily at standard times, with a minimum of six hours apart (Figure 2 dosing plan). Participants are instructed to take it before breakfast (30 to 60 minutes) and the same before dinner. Participants are instructed not to drink grapefruit for seven days prior to the first dose of study medication and during the rest of the st udy. 
The study drug is taken as normal on the mornings of assessments. As far as practical, the same assessor carries out assessments at each visit. Assessment data are stored and not made available at subsequent visits.  Figure 2: Dosing plan.

 Participants take their routine anti-PD medication on the day of their clinical visit, and when ON (PD 
medications are working) the testing is done. CBD and metabolite levels will be measurements: Blood CBD and metabolite levels will be measured at screeni ng visit, each dose assessment visit, and safety follow up visit. Urinary CBD and 
metabolites levels will be tested at dose assessment visits  and safety follow up visit. 
Potential drug-drug interactions: 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_128011], PharmD , to study possible drug interactions . CBD 
concentrations and adverse events  will be  monitored in the presence  of concomitant  medications  
which  are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 2C19. 
There are many possible interactions, but some are more likely and clinically relevant. Thus, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_829517] . The following drugs may increase the level of CBD: fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, 
fluconazole, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] , and nefazodone . The following dugs may decrease the level of CBD:

[ADDRESS_1151107]. John’s Wort. The following drugs may 
interact with CBD to cause their levels to increase: alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam, 
oxazepam, temazepam, zo lpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_23028], narcotics (codeine, methadone, oxycodone, 
hydromorphone, morphine), cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, propranolol , and acetaminophen . 
Participants will be instructed not to take more than 1 gram per day of acetaminophen.   CBD is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19. The plasma level of clobazam, which is metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]2C19, therefore is expected to increase if CBD is added . Clobazam, per M icromedix, causes 
somnolence (16 -25%) . In a recent study, Lancet Neurology 2016;15:270- 278, using the a much 
higher dose of CBD study drug than as in our trial there was approximately twice as much 
somnolence AEs reported in participants on both CBD and cl ozabam than in participants on 
CBD and not clobazam . Thus clobazam will be exclusionary in this study.  
 The following is additional information relevant to the population of this study, Parkinson disease (PD).  CBD is metabolized by [CONTACT_128075]450 enzymes 2C19 and 3A4 and an inhibitor of these isoenzymes. Thus the expectation is that selegiline levels could increase. CBD may mildly induce the expression of 1A2, 2B6, and 3A4. Thus the expectation is that levels of rasagiline, ropi[INVESTIGATOR_11122], and selegiline may decrease.  CBD is a relatively potent inhibitor of UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 and has no significant effect on other UGT isoenzymes . The expectation is that the level of rotigotine may increase.  
 CBD is highly protein bound, so rasagiline, selegiline, and rotigotine levels may increase transiently.  
Checking plasma concentration levels of these anti- PD medications is not a routine clinical practice . 
Thus the PI [INVESTIGATOR_829518] . The most important 
and likely adver se effects of a clinically significant increase in the level of selegiline is anxiety, 
dyskinesia, agitation, insomnia, and hallucinations. The most important and likely adverse effects of a clinically significant decrease in the levels of rasagiline, ropi [INVESTIGATOR_11122], and selegiline is an increase in 
the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease, which are resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability . The most important and likely adverse effects of a clinically significant increase 
in rotigotine is low blood pressure, somnolence, and impulse control disorders. 
Instructions to Participants at the End of Each Stage: 
We will provide the following instructions about continued marijuana use at the end of the study to 
facilitate safety:  
Cannabis (marijuana) is composed of many substances. Street cannabis is high in 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which causes the “high” feeling. Street cannabis has lower concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD). The cannabis preparations sold at dispensaries have various concentrations of THC and CBD. The ratio of THC to CBD plays a role in a preparation’s beneficial and adverse effects . Studies to date suggest that THC is especially risky in person with PD, because 
it may worsen thinking and coordination and cause psychiatric symptoms . The precise effects of all 
the substances in cannabis is unknown. Using marijuana should be under the supervision of your physician, with monitoring the symptoms of PD and other diseases, as well as the interactions of marijuana and other drugs you t ake. 
 
C.3 Randomization and drug dispensation: 
35 
 Patients who consent will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (40-60 and 61-80) and disease severity (H&Y 1-2.5, 3-
5) and divided into blocks of a few patients each, depending on order of recruitment. Equal numbers from each block will be assigned to CBD or placebo group in random order.  [CONTACT_829561], the PI, will obtain an amended DEA Schedule 1 license prior to the shipment of the study drug and all procedures of drug handling will be according to DEA specifications and protocol provided by [CONTACT_513589] [CONTACT_33365]. Briefly, designated study personnel will receive the study drug, do the formulation procedure, store it, measure and label it. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_829519].   
C.4 Blinding assessment and Un- blinding procedures:  
Blinding assessment:  
Active drug and placebo will look and taste the same as much as possible. Participants and all study personnel except for [CONTACT_128092], [CONTACT_829566], and her fellow, are blinded. At the end of treatment phase visits, participants will be asked about the treatment allocation they think they were assigned. The answers are taken in forms with five responses of “strongly believe the treatment is drug ,” “Somewhat believe the treatment is drug.” “Somewhat believe the treatment is 
placebo ,” “Strongly believe the treatment is placebo ,” and “Don’t know.”  
Un-blinding procedures:  
The identity of the treatment assigned to individual participants can be revealed in an emergency only. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_829520]-blinding of treatment are stored safely, that their location is known, and that access is readily available to the relevant staff in case of an emergency. [CONTACT_128092], the statistician w ill provide the information when 
un-blinding is requested by [CONTACT_978]. As a back -up, [CONTACT_128092] will provide a file of sealed envelopes to 
the PI, which is kept in a locked file in her office. The location is known to the PI, sub-I, and coordinator. A sealed envelope coded with each participant number is provided. In the event that [CONTACT_128092] is not available to provide break the blind the PI [INVESTIGATOR_128019]. A participant’s treatment assignment should only be un-blinded when knowledge of the t reatment is 
essential for the safety of the participant. Un-blinding for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  
C.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]:  
Note there are no interim analyses planned.  
Participant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] : 
• If participant cannot tolerate t he study drug at any dose level 
• if participant develops a CTCAE criteria grade 3 or 4 adverse event per that the Investigator 
determines is related the study drug 
• Pregnancy or breast -feeding  
• Requested by [CONTACT_108335]  
• Failure by [CONTACT_829550] 
• Participant is at significant risk of failing to comply with the provisions of the protocol as to 
cause harm to self or seriously interfere with the validity of the study results 
• At the discretion of the IRB, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
If a participant is withdrawn from the study, all efforts will be made to complete the early 
termination visit that includes efficacy assessments and safety follow -up. In addition, women of 
childbearing potential will have a post-study pregnancy test performed at the early termination visit.  
[ADDRESS_1151108] treatment taken at time of withdrawal. Study medication discontinuations will be summarized in a similar fashion.  
 Participant s will be advised that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Reasons that 
participants may be withdrawn from the study include the following:  Participant discontinued study medication and wishes to withdraw. Participant consent is withdraw n. 
Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]  
• Participants are unable to be recruited  
• Study drug becomes unavailable 
• Participants are unable to tolerate the study drug at any dose level  
• Discovery (from this or other studies) of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable health  
hazard to participants, i.e., development of the same adverse event, CTCAE criteria grade ≥3, related to study drug in ≥2 participants  
• At the discretion of the IRB, Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
 
C.6 Adverse events assessments:  
Adverse events will be classified according to the grades defined in the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Any adverse event or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious  (see definition below) and occurs after administration of the investigational product will be documented by [CONTACT_1034]-Investigator within 24 hours of discovery of the event. 
Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of each AE/SAE will be classified into one of five defined grades. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline:  Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local, or n oninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADLs. Instrumental ADLs refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care ADLs. Self -care ADLs refer to 
bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  
The severity of the AE will be recorded in the appropriate section on the AE page of the CRF.  
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
The evaluation of severity will be distinguished from the evaluation of “seriousness.” A severe event 
might not meet the criteria for seriousness and a serious event might be evaluated as mild or moderate. For example, a participant might have a severe headache that does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128020]; or a participant might have a mild myocardial infarction that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_636918]. 
[ADDRESS_1151109] medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death during the period of protocol-defined surveillance. Death due to PD will not be 
considered an SAE. However, if a patient requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829521], the 
specific sign or symptom leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479946] r eported as an SAE. If death due to 
PD occurs outside of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128024]’s PD, no 
SAE report is required. The death will be recorded as part of PD and patient disposition. 
• Is life -threatening (NOTE: The term “ life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the participant, in the view of the Investigator, is at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might cause death if it was mor e severe) . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]*. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
*Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself an SAE, although 
the reasons for it might be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26179]/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the participant was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. It should be noted that for this study, participants with planned or anticipated surgery should not be enrolled into the study. 
Important Medic al Events: Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether a 
case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening 
or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, or incapacity but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious, and examples of such events are: 
• Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous hydrocortisone 
treatment  
• Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-
acetylcysteine  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
• Devel opment of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Unanticipated Adverse Events  
An unanticipated problem is any event or information that was unforeseen and indicates that the 
research procedures caused harm  (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) to 
participants or others or indicates that participants or others are at increased risk of harm than was 
previously known or recognized. An “ unexpected ” adverse reaction is one in which the nature or 
severity of which is not consistent with information in the relevant source document(s). Until source documents are amended, expedited reporting is required for additional occurrences of the reaction.  
Relati onship to Study Drug  
The relationship or association of the AE/SAE to study drug will be characterized as “related” or “not related .” An AE/SAE will be considered to be not related to the use of the study drug if any of 
the following criteria are met:   
• An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the product and the onset on 
the AE (e.g., the event occurred either before, or too long after administration of the product for it 
to be considered product- related);   
38 
 • A causal relationship between the product and the AE is biologically implausible (e.g., death as a 
passenger in an automobile accident);   
• A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the AE is present (e.g., typi[INVESTIGATOR_829522] a concomitant drug).  
Adverse events w ill be considered “related” to the use of the study drug if none of the “not related” 
criteria are met. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship of the 
AE/SAE to study drug. An AE/SAE may be related to the study drug, other concomitant medications, intercurrent illness, a procedure performed in the course of the study, or another reason. Among the potential etiologies, the Investigator will make a determination based on the most likely causal relationship. Alternative causes , such as the natural history of any underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study drug will be considered. The Investigator will also take into account the Investigator’s Brochure in the causality assessment. There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, the Investigator will make an assessment of causality prior to transmission of the SAE report to the Sponsor, as the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The Investigator may change the causality assessment in light of follow-up information by [CONTACT_636934]. SAEs that are considered related (i.e., determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related) to the investigational product by [CONTACT_1034]-Investigator will be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes. Any SAE that occurs after tre atment completion, and is considered by [CONTACT_1034]-
Investigator to be related to the investigational product, will be documented and reported as appropriate. 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Agencies 
Events meeting the following criteria will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as expedited IND Safety Reports according to the following guidance and timelines: [ADDRESS_1151110]’s Investigator Brochure. Such reports are to be 
telephoned or faxed to the appropriate review division at FDA and to the manufacturer of the investigational product within seven calendar days of first learning of the event. [ADDRESS_1151111].  Written IND Safety reports will include an Analysis of Similar Events in accordance with regulation 
21 CFR § 312.32. All safety reports previously filed by [CONTACT_1034]-Investigator with the IND concerning similar events will be analyzed and the significance of the new report in light of the previous, similar reports commented on. Written IND safety reports with Analysis of Similar Events will be submitted to the appropriate review division at the FDA, and the manufacturer of the investigational product within [ADDRESS_1151112] learning of the event, using FDA Form 3500A. Written IND Safety Reports will be submitted to the IRB(s) of record per IRB Guidelines.  
IND Annual Reports 
39 
 The Sponsor-Investigator will provide annual reports to the appropriate review division at the FDA 
within 60 days of the IND’s anniversary date, until the IND is withdrawn or terminated.  
C.7 Risks of Study Drug: 
A review of 25 studies on the safety and efficacy of CBD did not identify significant side effects across a wide range of  dosages, including acute and chronic dose regimens, using various modes of 
administration [Bergamaschi M.M., et al. 2011]. There are no rare but serious side effects reported. 
The most frequently occurring side effect was somnolence (i.e.drowsiness) (25%) . Other side 
effects, in order of prevalence, include: diarrhea (19%), decreased appetite (19%), fatigue (13%), convulsion  (11%), increased appetite (9%), status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (8%), lethargy (7%), weight increased (7%), and weight loss (6%) [Devinsky O, et al. 2016]. Other side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms, increased prolactin levels, weight gain, increased serum concentrations of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006], and elevated liver function tests.

 D. Description, Risks and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools: Patients could be uncomfortable about their survey of cannabis, drug, alcohol, and tobacco use that is administered during screening in both Stages. However, this information is essential for their safety, to check for history of addiction, and if this is found then the participant could be harmed by [CONTACT_829551]. In addition, this information is needed for scientific rigor. 
Federal funding sources are likely to want this information to understand the relevance and importance of future cannabis studies. The importance of having the information will be explained and the participant will be reminded that participation is voluntary.    CBD’s effect on many aspects of PD are being studied, besides the primary and major secondary outcome measur es. This makes the visits longer and may be tiring for some participants. To 
minimize discomfort participants will be offered sufficient breaks and maximal efforts for efficiency will be made to minimize visit time. The reason for the many assessments is twofold. First, PD is a complex disorder with many different disabling symptoms, and secondly, it is prudent to maximize the information from this study. Studies on cannabis are sorely needed, since many PD patients are taking this potentially dangerous drug as it becomes more available. Access is becoming more available throughout the US as more states are considering legalizing use of medical and recreational marijuana. Besides this lack of vital information, obtaining funding and getting through all the regulatory steps required for study of cannabis is very hard, thus we want to obtain maximal information when such a study (as this one) can be done. This information is vital to guide future studies. To minimize the risk in the study, the following procedures will be complied with: 1. The study will be conducted in compliance with the COMIRB approved protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements.  
2. The study will be overseen by [CONTACT_128081] a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) at University of Colorado. 
3. Each patient will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_829552] [ADDRESS_1151113], according to mandated guidelines. 
5. All adverse events and serious adverse events will be followed until resolution (or return to baseline status), or until the condition stabilizes or is otherwise explained, or until participant dies or is lost to follow -up. 
6. Safety assessments are comprehensive and include vital signs, history and  physical examination, 
concomitant medications collection, EKGs, safety labs (Hematology, Hemoglobin A1C, Complete Metabolic Profile and Liver Function Tests), blood and urinary cannabis and metabolites analysis, MoCA, QUIP -RS, C- SSRS, NPI, SCOPA -sleep, Anxiety short form, 
Depression short form, Emotional and behavioral dyscontrol short form, Fatigue Severity Scale, Pain Intensity and Interference short form, study drug compliance check, adverse event check, and urine and blood pregnancy testing.  
We will follow the FDA’s Guidance for evaluating and monitoring potential drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Participants with stable liver disease can be included if they have a normal total bilirubin and prothrombin time/INR at baseline. Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin) will be drawn at baseline and at each visit while participants are on the study drug. In addition, if these labs are abnormal at the end of the study visit they will be repeated at the safety follow up visit two weeks later and repeated until back to baseline values . During each visit that assesses the effects 
of the study drug, nonspecific symptoms of Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) will be checked, e.g., anorexia, nausea, fatigue, right upper abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. If symptoms indicative of DILI occur , the participant will return to clinic immediately for measurement of laboratory signs 
of hepatic injury, regardless of when the next visit or monitoring interval is scheduled. At any time  if 
aminotransferase enzymes are greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), we will repeat ALT, AST, ALP , and bilirubin within 48-[ADDRESS_1151114] or repeat testing 
shows aminotransferase >3xULN for participants with normal base line measures or two fold 
increases above baseline values for participants with elevated values before drug exposure, we will initiate close observation to determine whether the abnormalities are improving or worsening. Per the FDA, close observation includes:  
• Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly. Frequency of 
retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial drug has been discontinued and the participant is asymptomatic.  
• Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
• Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets.  
• Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; NASH; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease.  
• Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct bilirubin).  
• Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
 
[ADDRESS_1151115] may be unnecessary. The decision of whether to stop the study drug will be affected by [CONTACT_128082], the accumulating clinical experience, the clinical status of the patient, and many other factors. We will consult the UCH hepatology service and keep the following FDA guidance in mind. The FDA states that discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:  
ALT or AST >8xULN  
ALT or AST >5xULN for more than two weeks  
ALT or AST >3xULN and (TBL >2xULN or INR >1.5)  
ALT or AST >3xULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
 
Data collection tools:  
To protect the privacy of patients, the data collected in the study is stored completely de-identified. 
A code will be linked to the information provided, and answers are entered into a computer database using this code. No personal identifiers will be linked to the participant’s information in the database. All of this information in the computer is password protected. The code will be linked to the participant’s University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829523] a separate computer database. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_128028] a locked cabinet.  
 
E. Potential Scientific Problems:   To maximize scientific integrity this study was peer reviewed by [CONTACT_829553] (CDPHE) before receiving funding. We do not expect problems with recruitment because 
of the high level of interest and publicity regarding cannabis research, especially the CDPHE funded studies. In addition, we have a large population of PD patients, since we see over [ADDRESS_1151116] 14 movement disorders providers assisting recruitment.   F. Data Analysis Plan:   Intention to treat concept is followed. In order to minimize data entry errors a double data entry system will be used.  If study participant agrees, the de-identified data would be shared within CDPHE Marijuana grantee consortium for future research.   
The analysis will be performed in accordance with the analysis plan devised prior to unblinding. Baseline variables will be examined for equality between the two sequence groups. The primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes will be analyzed as below from baseline to the end of 2.5 mg/kg/day.  
Primary Specific Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of CBD on motor symptoms in PD. 
The data will be analyzed to compare two randomized independent samples, CBD and placebo. Means and confidence intervals will be presented for the pre and post outcome values by [CONTACT_3148], 
[ADDRESS_1151117] of CBD on 
severity and  duration of intractable tremor and other symptoms in PD. 
 Safety and tolerability and will be assessed in five ways:  
1.  Frequency of study- related adverse events at each dose level collected at study visits. 
Analysis (frequency of study- related adverse events at each dose level in the two groups, 
treatment vs. placebo) will be mostly descriptive and proportions and confide nce intervals 
will be calculated. Contrasts involving repeated measures on the same participants can be 
tested with McNemar’s test (for two correlated proportions) or GEE models/GLMMs. Contrasts for independent data can be tested with standard two sample proportions test and with GLMs. Proportions, logistic regression, and relative risk regression can be applied to 
binary outcomes over a fixed period of time, and Poisson models can be applied to counts or 
events over time.  
2. Vital signs, orthostatic blood pressures, physical exam, EKG, and labs (hematology, complete metabolic profile, urinalysis) will be done during study visits. For vital signs and labs, data will be analyzed as a simple two -period trial. Means and confidence intervals will 
be presented pre and post treatment by [CONTACT_1570], and for the change scores by [CONTACT_1570]. A two independent sample T- test will compare the means of the change 
scores between the treatment groups.  More complex situations can be analyzed with 
longitudinal regression models. 
3. Standardized assessment tools (MoCA, Cognition assessment battery, Anxiety short form, 
NPI, SCOPA -Sleep, ISI, DBAS -16, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272], RBDSQ, QUIP -RS, C-
SSRS, Depression short form, Emotional Behavioral dyscontrol short form, Fat igue severity 
scale, MDS UPDRS, UDysRS, Pain Intensity 3a short form and Pain Intensity 4a short form, 
IRLS, PDQ -39 and EQ- 5D-5L) and lab tests, the data will be analyzed as a simple two -
period trial.  Means and confidence intervals will be presented pre and post treatment by 
[CONTACT_829554]. A two independent sample T- test 
will compare the means of the change scores between the treatment groups . More complex 
situations can be analyzed with longitudinal regression models.   
4. Proportion of participants who drop out of the study due to study drug intolerance. Analysis (proportions of participants who drop out of the study due to study drug intolerance in the two treatment groups) will be mostly descriptive, and proportions and confidence intervals 
will be calculated . Proportion differences between groups can be compared with the standard 
test. 
 
Exploratory Outcome Measures: The efficacy of CBD on  cognition, psychosis, sleep, daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], mood, fatigue, pain, impulsivity, other motor and non-motor PD signs, restless legs syndrome, REM sleep behavior disorder, quality of life , and plasma  levels of cytokine are evaluated 
using the aforementioned assessment tools. The change from baseline to end of 2.5 mg/kg/day is compared.

Exploratory analyses: To study the efficacy of CBD on cognition, anxiety, psychosis, sleep, daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], mood, fatigue, pain, impulsivity, other motor and non-motor PD signs, restless legs 
syndrome, REM sleep behavior disorder, plasma  levels of cytokine, and seborrheic dermatitis.  
 
Exploratory outcomes include assessments of cognition, anxiety, psychosis, sleep, daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], mood, fatigue, pain, impulsivity, other motor and non-motor PD signs, restless legs syndrome, REM sleep behavior disorder , and plasma  levels  of cytokine. Continuous outcomes will 
be analyzed in the same way as tremor . Transforms or non- parametric methods will be applied as 
necessary . Non -continuous outcomes will be analyzed with generalized estimating equations models, 
generalized mixed models, and McNemar’s test for binary outcomes.   
 
Sample Size Justification  
Using preliminary data we estimate a standard deviation for the within treatment UPDRS  Motor 
change scores, post treatment compared to baseline, of 6.72, and a correlation between the p aired 
observations of the change score of 0.75. Consistent with the preliminary data we anticipate a mean baseline UPDRS Motor score of 23, so a 25% treatment effect would have a magnitude of 5.75, less than the within treatment mean change score of magnit ude 6.[ADDRESS_1151118], 
testing for a between treatment difference on the within treatment UPDRS Motor change scores, at alpha = 0.05, would require a total sample size of 46 patients for 80% power, and 60 patients for 90% power. Compensating for the possibility of 20% drop out, we would need to recruit 58 patients for 80% power, and 75 patients for 90% power. Thus we plan to recruit [ADDRESS_1151119] 60 patients complete the study.  Since other outcomes are either descriptive and/or exploratory, and sample size is limited, adjustment for multiple testing adjustments are not planned across different outcome variables. 
 
G. Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
Marijuana is one of the most used alternative medications. Since it became legal and readily available in Colorado, Parkinson disease (PD) and other movement disorders patients have been trying it, usually without the knowledge of or supervision of their neurologist. This study will promote the safety of our patients and provide data useful in evaluating the effect and safety of CBD on tremor, cognition, anxiety, psychosis, and other symptoms, including sleep, impulsivity, suicidality, mood, fatigue, restless legs syndrome, pain, bradykinesia, rigidity, balance, and dyskinesia in PD patients. Data from this study are essential to aid in designing future marijuana research.

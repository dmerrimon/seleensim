Section  Revision 
Table 8  Added treatment of asymptomatic bacteremia is prescribed 
based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]2 
 2 According to guidelines in both Europe and the United 
States, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (the presence of 
1 or more species of bacteria growing in the urine irrespective of the presence of pyuria, in the absence of signs or symptoms 
attributabl e to UTI) is in most cases not beneficial and may be 
harmful. Based on standard of care and protocol restrictions 
surrounding use of additional antibiotics, patients in this trial 
should not receive additional antibiotic for asymptomatic 
bacteriuria.  Addi tional therapy should only be given if signs 
and symptoms warrant ongoing treatment for symptomatic cUTI (i.e., based on their clinical course in the absence of 
microbiological data).

Title:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Active -controlled 
Noninferiority Study Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety, and 
Tolerability of Cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -[ADDRESS_142087] Infections , Including Acute Pyelonephritis  
Phase of Study:  Phase 3  
Target Population: Adult male and female patients with complicated urinary tract 
infection (cUTI) , including acute pyelonephritis  (AP)  
Number of Patients:  582 patients will be randomized into 2 groups in a 2:1 ratio 
(388 patients to cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133; 194 patients to 
meropenem)  
Number of Sites:  Approximately 122 sites in the [LOCATION_002] and other countries  
Study Duration:  Approximately 14 months  
Duration of Treatment:  7 days (up to 14 days for patients with bacteremia)  
Drug Administered:  Test:  Cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 (2 g/0.5 g intravenously [IV] every 
8 hours [q8h]) 
Active comparator:  Meropenem  (1 g IV q8h)  
Study Drug Administration:  All study drugs will be provided by [CONTACT_456].  
For c efepim e/VNRX-5133, cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_126227] (2 g/vial, 
sterile, white to pale yellow powder) and VNRX-5133 (0.5 g/vial 
sterile, white to yellow powder ) will each be reconstituted 
independently, then combined into a single IV bag, and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution for IV injection. Cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX-5133 will be administered q8h via IV pump over a 2-hour period. In order to maintain the blind, patients 
randomized to c efepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 will also receive meropenem 
placebo  (0.9% sodium chloride solution) administered via IV 
pump over 30 minutes. 
Meropenem (1 g/vial) will be reconstituted in a single IV bag and 
will serve as active comparator for IV injection. Meropenem will be administered q8h via IV pump over 30 minutes. In order to maintain the blind, patients randomized to meropenem will also receive cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 placebo (0.9% sodium chloride 
solution) administered via IV pump over a 2-hour period. 
Study drug and placebo IV bags as well as IV tubing will be 
blinded with sleeves.  
All patients will be treated for 7 days of IV therapy. Patients with bacteremia may receive up to 14 days of treatment at  the 
inves tigator ’s discretion.

staff will remain blinded to study drug. 
Objectives:  Primary objective:  
• To assess the efficacy  of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -[ADDRESS_142089] infection (UTI )-core symptoms ( or return 
to pre-morbid baseline ) at the T est of C ure (TOC) visit  
Secondary objectives:  
• To determine the efficacy of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -[ADDRESS_142090] to the per- patient 
microbiological response, per -pathogen microbiologic 
response, and symptomatic resolution of all UTI- core 
symptoms at various timepoints in various populations 
• To determine the efficacy of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -[ADDRESS_142091] to the per- patient 
microbiological response, pe r-pathogen microbiologic 
response, and symptomatic resolution of all UTI- core 
symptoms in patients with cUTI due to cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]- resistant 
pathogens at various timepoints in various populations  
• To evaluate the safety and to lerability profile of 
cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 compared with meropenem in the 
treatment of patients with a cUTI in the safety population  
• To evaluate the steady -state pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_126228] -5133 in patients using a population 
PK model  
Study Design:  Study VNRX-5133-201 is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double- blind , double-dummy, active- controlled noninferiority 
study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 compared with an a ctive control, 
meropenem , in adult patients with cUTI, including AP . Each 
patient is expected to complete the study within approximately 4 to 5 weeks.  
After obtaining  signed informed consent and confirming eligibility 
within 24 hours prior to randomization, pa tients will be 
randomized  in a 2 :1 ratio to receive either cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133

Confidential  Page 14 of 101   (2 g/0.5  g IV q8h) or the active comparator, meropenem  (1 g IV 
q8h) on Study D ay 1.  
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_126260] (AP only versus 
complicated lower UTI with or without AP ) and by [CONTACT_11338] (North 
America and Western Europe versus Eastern Europe versus rest of the world). At least 30% of the population will have AP .  
Patients may recei ve up to 24 hours of antibacterials for treatment 
of cUTI prior to randomization ; however, the number of patients 
with prior antibacterial use will be limited to approximately 25% 
of the population. Before receipt of study drug, a urine specimen 
and blood cultures will be obtained from all patients for culture and for in vitro  antibacterial  susceptibility testing. Patients with an 
indwelling catheter should have urine samples collected following the placement of a new catheter, or if the indwelling catheter cannot be removed, aseptic techniques should be used through a properly disinfected collection port. Patients with an indwelling 
catheter should be randomized only if they are expected to permanently discontinue use of the catheter prior to Study Day 5. 
Screening assessments will also include a Daily  Patient Symptom 
Questionnaire (D PSQ) and a Pre-morbid P atient Symptom 
Questionnaire (PPSQ) . The D PSQ will be administered at 
screening , daily while on study drug, and at End of T reatment 
(EOT ), TOC , and Late F ollow-up ( LFU ) visits to determine the 
presence and intensity of cUTI symptoms.  The PPSQ  will be 
administered once at screening  to determine whether a patient 
normally experiences urinary tract symptoms ( i.e., in the absence 
of a UTI) that may be attributable to other disease processes 
(e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH] ).  
Study drug will be administered  IV for [ADDRESS_142092] dose on Study Day 7 for patients without bacteremia . All patients (who do not require 
dosing adjustments for renal dysfunction) will receive at least [ADDRESS_142093] their treatment extended up to 14  days at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
Patients will be admitted at screening and remain at the study site or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_126229].  The EOT visit will be performed within  [ADDRESS_142094] dose of IV study drug. Patients may be discharged 
from the study site after the EOT visi t if clinically stable and at the 
investigator ’s discretion.

Cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_126233] a broad -spectrum, fourth- generation cephalosporin antibiotic administered 
intravenously (IV) that has been in clinical use for over [ADDRESS_142122] infections (cUTI s), and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs).

cUTI is defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_126266] a documented mi crobial 
pathogen on a culture of urine or blood accompanied by [CONTACT_126267], including fever, chills, malaise, flank pain, back pain, and/or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness, that occur in the presence of a functional or anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract or in the presence of catheterization. Patients with acute pyelonephritis (AP), regardless of underlying abnormalities of the urinary tract, are considered a subset of patients with cUTIs.

1.2 Study Rationale  
Cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX-5133 is being developed as an IV antibiotic formulation in combination for the 
treatment of patients with serious g ram-negative bacterial infections. The strategy of using 
β-lactam/ β-lactamase inhibitor combinations for treatment of infections caused by 
β-lactamases-producing pathogens has been successful in a variety of bacterial infections. 
Gram -negative pathogens, including those producing extended- spectrum β- lactamases ( ESBLs ), 
AmpC β -lactamases, and carbapenemases, are important causes of cUTIs. The spectrum of 
activity of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -[ADDRESS_142126] gram -negative pathogens isolated in cUTIs, including pyelonephritis. Although meropenem is 
approved for other indications, including cIAI, skin and soft tissue structure infections, and 
bacterial meningitis in pediatric patients , it is not approved f or use in cUTI in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US). However, meropenem is approved for cUTI in other geographic regions. Furthermore, 
carbapenems are the drug s of choice against ESBL -producing gram -negative pathogens, 
especially in serious infections. As such, it is an appropriate comparator to use when evaluating a new drug designed to treat infections due to bacteria harboring serine β-lactamases.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_142127] ion Rationale 
For the cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 treatment group, the selected dose and infusion duration of 
cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 selected are expected to provide drug exposure that will result in a high 
probability of the PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) target attainment . A number of in vitro  and in vivo  
PK/PD studies have been conducted to characterize the pharmacological basis of VNRX -[ADDRESS_142128] been to 1) identify the PK/PD index that best describes the exposure-response relationship of VNRX- 5133 administer ed 
in combination with cefepi[CONTACT_92727] 2) characterize the magnitude of the PK/PD index required for various degrees of bacterial killing.  In ad dition, the results from the nonclinical PK/PD studies 
conducted to date, the human PK data collected in Phase [ADDRESS_142129]  human therapeutic doses. Lastly, the probability of PK/PD target 
attainment in clinical efficacy studies was further explored by [CONTACT_126268] a population PK model based on Phase 1 data and use of Monte Carlo simulations. Taken together, these data 
demonstrate that a 0.5 g dose of VNRX-5133, when administered with cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048] 2 g every 8 hours (q8h), is expected to be highly effective, even after taking into account increased PK variability  expected  in a patient population compared to that observed in healthy volunteers in 
Phase 1 studies. 
Cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX-[ADDRESS_142130] Characteristics indicates that doses of 0.5 or 1 g meropenem q8h is appropriate for cUTI. 
Protocol VNRX -5133 -201 Amendment  2 VNRX -5133  
Cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -[ADDRESS_142131] pathogens that are more difficult to treat, the dose of 
1 g has been chosen. Although meropenem is not approved in the US for cUTI, the US prescribing information  indicates that 1  g meropenem q8h is appropriate for the treatment of 
patients with cIAI s and skin and soft tissue structure infections due to P aeruginosa, which is 
consistent with the goal to use a higher dose (i.e., 1 g) in more difficult- to-treat infections.  
Patient s with bacteremia at study entry may have their treatment extended up to 14 days at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
Additional details on human PK and clinical dosing regimen are provided in the IB.

1.2.2 Patient Selection Rationale  
The population enrolled into the study will include adult male and female patients with cUTI (AP or complicated lower urinary tract infection  [UTI]). At least 30% of patients will be 
diagnosed with AP. Before receipt of study drug, urine specimen and blood cultures will be 
obtained from all patients for culture and for in vitro  antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Patie nts 
known to have a pathogen with documented resistance to meropenem should be excluded from the study. 
1.[ADDRESS_142132] that is an effective treatment for cUTI in the face of the changing pattern of antibiotic resistance and the need for antibiotics to treat increasingly resistant bacteria. It is possible that cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 will not prove to be a sufficiently effe ctive treatment for cUTIs (i .e., not 
as effective as the comparator treatment). This risk is mitigated in that the patients will be  closely 
monitored and managed with appropriate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_126235]. 
The r isk considerations for this study should encompass the known and potential risks for the 
development product cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX-[ADDRESS_142133] meropenem. The risks for cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_126236] ; such risks will not 
be discussed in  this section.  
The risks for cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -[ADDRESS_142134] not been fully elucidated; however, it is assumed that 
known or potential risks for cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX-5133 should include those identified in the clinical study experience with cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX-5133, VNRX-5133 alone, and cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_126237]. Potential risks for cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 include the occurrence of events seen with cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_126238] a greater  frequency and/or severity than  those seen with cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]. In Phase 1 
studies, constipation and abdominal pain were reported. Additional risk information for

3.1 Study Design 
Study VNRX-5133-201 is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, 
active-controlled noninferiority study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 compared with an active control, meropenem , in adult patients with cUTI, 
including AP. Each patient is expected to complete the study within approximately 4 to 5 weeks.   
Patients with cUTI, including AP, will be enrolled. After obtaining signed informed consent and confirming eligibility within 24 hours prior to randomization, patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 (2 g/0.5 g IV q8h) infused over 2 hours plus 
meropenem placebo infused over 30 minutes  or the active comparator, meropenem (1 g IV q8h) 
infused over 30 minutes plus cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX-5133 placebo infused over 2 hours starting on Study Day 1.  
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_126260] (AP  only versus complicated lower UTI with or 
without AP) and by [CONTACT_11338] (North America and Western Europe versus Eastern Europe versus 
rest of the world). At least 30% of the p opulation will have AP .  
Patients may receive up to 24 hours of antibacterials for treatment of cUTI prior to randomization; however, the number of patients with prior antibacterial use will be limited to 
approximately 25% of the population. Before receipt of study drug, urine specimen and blood 
cultures will be obtained from all patients for culture and for in vitro  antibacterial susceptibility 
testing. Patients with an indwelling catheter should have urine samples collected following the placement of a new catheter, or if the indwelling catheter cannot be removed, aseptic techniques should be used through a properly disinfected collection port. Patients with an indwelling catheter should be randomized only if they are expected to permanently discontinue use of the catheter prior to Study Day  5. 
Screening assessmen ts will also include a Daily Patient Symptom Questionnaire (D PSQ) and a 
Pre-morbid Patient Symptom Questionnaire (PPSQ). The D PSQ will be administered at 
screening , daily while on study drug, and at End of Treatment ( EOT ), TOC, and Late Follow -up 
(LFU ) visits to determine the presence and intensity of cUTI symptoms. The PPSQ will be 
administered once at screening to determine whether a patient normally experiences urinary tract symptoms ( i.e., in the absence of a UTI) that may be attributable to other disease processes 
(e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH]).  
Study drug will be administered IV for [ADDRESS_142139] 
dose on Study Day 7 for patients witho ut bacteremia. All patients (who do not require dosing 
adjustments for renal dysfunction) will receive at least [ADDRESS_142140] their treatment extended up to 14  days at the investigator ’s discretion.  
Patients will be admitted at screening and remain at the study site or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_126239] . The EO T visit will be performed within 
[ADDRESS_142141] dose of IV study drug. Patients may be discharged from the study site after the EOT visit  if clinically stable and at the investigator ’s discretion.

prior to dosing. However,  because dosing recommendations for the study drugs vary depending 
on the patient’s renal function, the investigator should consider whether the  change in eGFR 
warrants a change in IV study drug dosage or frequency. Since a decline in renal function may be

5.3.2 Dose Adjustment for Patients with eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 
When clinically indicated, eGFR calculation should be repeated to determine whether dose adjustment is needed. If the dose is adjusted, local clinical laboratory and eGFR results should be 
recorded on the unscheduled/local laboratory electronic case report form (eCRF ). 
The dose regimen of all study drugs should be adjusted according to the guidelines detailed in Table  3 based on eGFR. Given the different eGFR requirements for dose change across the 
treatment regime nts, eGFR should be re-t ested before adjusting therapy if the e GFR is between 
50 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m

5.4 Treatment Duration  
All patients will receive 7 days of IV treatment.  Based on the scheduled study drug 
administration for patients without bacteremia, the patient could complete treatment on study day 
7 or study day 8.  
All non- bacteremic patients (who do not require dosing adjustments for renal dysfunction) will 
receive at least 19 doses and no more than 21 doses of study drug.

There is no oral stepdown therapy, and patients are not permitted to continue oral antibacterials 
at home after completion of IV study drug (e.g. prophylaxis). If prophylactic therapy is warranted  due to recurrent cUTIs, it should not be started until after the LFU  visit if possible.  
Patients who are known to require prophylactic therapy and for whom withholding therapy until the LFU visit is not in their best interest should not be e nrolled (see Exclusion Criterion  8).  The 
Investigator should continually assess whether the study drug has failed (i.e., the patient has signs and symptoms of cUTI that have not improved or have recurred such that additional antibiotic therapy is warranted) and rescue therapy is required.

All procedures will be performed in accordance with the schedule of assessments as detailed in  
Table  1. Detailed instructions for specific study procedures are provided in Section 7. De tailed 
requirements for reporting AEs and SAEs are provided in Section 8. 
6.1 Enrollment and Randomization  
After providing informed consent, patient s will be enrolled into the study, entered into the 
Interactive Web Response System/Interactive Voice Response System  (IWRS/IVRS ), and 
assigned a unique screening number from the IWRS /IVRS  for the screening process. After 
completing the screening process, pa tients who meet all eligibility criteria will be re -entered into 
the IWRS /IVRS  and assigned a unique randomization number and study drug randomly 
computer-generated by [CONTACT_8784] /IVRS . Randomization and screening numbers will not be 
reused. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive eit her cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 (2 g/0.5 g IV 
q8h) plus meropenem placebo, or the a ctive comparator,  meropenem (1 g IV q8h) plus 
cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048]/VNRX -5133 plac ebo, in a 2:[ADDRESS_142159] dose of study drug marks the start of Study Day 1. Therefore, randomization may occur on the same calendar day as Study Day 1 or on the previous calendar 
day.  
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_126260] (AP only versus complicated lower UTI with or 
without AP) and by [CONTACT_11338] (North America and Western Europe versus Eastern Europe versus rest of the world). At least 30% of the population will have AP . Patients may receive up to 
24 hours of antibacterial for treatment of cUTI prior to randomization ; however, the number of 
patients with prior antibacterial use will be limited to approximately 25% of the population.  
Patients w ho fail to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria should not be randomized or 
receive study drug. There will be no exceptions to this rule. Patients who fail to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will not be rescreened. Procedures for ineligible patients who are erroneously randomized are described in Section 6.1.1.

(separate from the other blinded monitors ) will also remain unblinded.  
The bioanalytical laboratory where the PK samples will be analyzed will b e provided treatment 
assignment information to facilitate analyzing samples using methods for only treatments 
administered . A third party pharmacokineticist responsible for the PK analysis may be unblinded 
in order to begin analysis of data prior to study completion. This pharmacokineticist will have no involvement in the conduct of the study. No one else will have access to the treatment assignment information. 
Procedures to maintain study blinding will be detailed in a separate blinding plan.

If the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) determines individual treatment assignment unblinding for patients is required to support an ad hoc meeting, an independent statistician will provide treatment information to the DSMB, and the DSMB will review unblinded data in the closed session.  
6.2 Study Restrictions and Prohibitions   
6.2.1 Restricted and Prohibited Medications  
Use of systemic antibacterials other than study drug therapy, including prophylactic antibacterials , is not permitted during the study except in the following circumstances : 
• If Enterococcus spp. or methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  is isolated  or 
suspected , then open-label vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin may be added to either 
of the study regimens according to the usual practice of the investigator.  
• When the investigator considers additio n of nonstudy antibacterials essential to the 
safety and well -being of the patient due to an AE (i.e., a new infection develops at 
another site). In this circumstance, if possible, the investigator should attempt to choose an antibacterial that will not have activity against the patient’s baseline cUTI pathogen(s) to avoid confounding the assessment of the effect of study drug.  
Patients who are known to require prophylactic therapy and for whom withholding therapy until LFU visit is not in their best interest should not be enrolled ( see Exclusion Criterion  8).

antibiotics . 
Valproic acid and divalproex sodium should not be administered. Valproic acid concentrations in 
the blood may drop below the therapeutic range when co -administered with meropenem.  
The following medications should be used with caution in all patients:  
• Aminoglycosides: Concomi tant administration of cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_126243]. 
Monitor renal function closely if aminoglycosides are administered  
• Diuretic  nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other 
cephalosporins with potent diuretics such as furosemide. Monitor renal function when cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_126244].

or age <50 years and ≥2 years without menses) or surgically sterilized. Male patients may not 
donate sperm from the first dose of study drug until [ADDRESS_142164] for >[ADDRESS_142165] be 
removed or replaced prior to collection of urine at screening for urinalysis and culture (unless removal or replacement is considered unsafe or is contraindicated due to a recent procedure or urological condition), so that the urine culture results are an accurate representation of th e 
pathogen(s) present.  
Patients should only be enrolled if the indwelling bladder catheter is expected to be permanently 
discontinued prior to Study Day 5.  
Indwelling bladder catheters should be maintained  as a sterile, closed drainage system, and the 
junction of the catheter and drainage tube should not be disconnected. Besides permanent 
catheter discontinuation, other indications for indwelling bladder catheter change may include malfunction or leakage, obstruction, and contamination of the system (breakage between the catheter and drainage tube).  
6.3 Premature Discontinuation  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study or study drug at any  time. Patients may also be 
prematurely discontinued from study drug or withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the 
investigator or sponsor at any time. Once a patient has been withdrawn from the study, they may

collected in the eC RF. 
6.3.1 Study Drug  Discontinuation  
Patients may be prematurely discontinued from study drug (i.e., before 7 full days of therapy and/or before cure of the infection [i.e., rescue therapy is necessary] ) for the following reasons:  
• Insufficient therapeutic effect of the study drug (i.e., requirement for additional nonstudy 
antibacterial therapy to treat cUTI based on the investigator’s clinical judgement ) 
• AE 
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_4676] (the patient is free to discontinue therapy at any time) 
• Physician decision (i.e., i n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , it is not in the best interest of 
the patient to continue study drug) 
• Sponsor decision 
• A decrease in eGFR to <30 mL/min/1.73 m
2 (An eGFR <30  mL/min/1.73 m2 should be 
rechecked and confirmed before discontinuation.) 
• AST or  ALT ≥10× ULN  
If a patient is prematurely discontinued from study drug, the EOT visit should be performed, and 
every effort should be made to retain the patient in the study and perform all assessments at the 
TOC and LFU visits. Patients withdrawn from study drug should receive rescue therapy (if appropriate) as determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
6.3.2 Study Withdrawal  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. A patient has the right to withdraw from the study 
at any time for any reason  without prejudice to further treatment (withdrawal of consent). Such 
patients will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If possible, the patient will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_126273]. If the patient has 
withdrawn from the study prior to completion of study therapy, every effort should be made to perform the EOT visit. AEs and SAEs will be followed up.  
6.4 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures defined in the protocol. 
All deviations will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_40177] a centralized location.

Deviations will be categorized by [CONTACT_126275]. Protocol 
deviation notification and reports are submitted to regulatory authorities and/or relevant institutional review boards ( IRBs ) according to applicable requirements/guidelines/law. 
6.5 Data Collection  
All c linical data, including AEs and prior/concomitant medications, will be collected for each 
patient by [CONTACT_126276] (EDC) system in an eCRF. Source data supporting EDC entries will be recorded in the patient’s medical records according to the standard practice of the study site.  
Investigators and study site personnel will be responsible for entering data within the eCRF and 
will respond to queries within the EDC system. Correction of any data errors and other such 
changes will be made within th e EDC system and captured in the electronic audit trail.

7.7 Efficacy E valuations  
7.7.1 Assessment of Symptomatic Clinical R esponse 
The symptomatic clinical success at TOC is one of the components of the primary outcome of this study; responses at EOT and LFU are secondary endpoints.  
During study conduct, patients will be required to report their cUTI symptoms on a series of 
formal questionnaires that will be administered by [CONTACT_126277].  The PPSQ will be 
administered once at screening  to determine whether a patient normally experiences urinary tract 
symptoms (i .e., in the absence of a UTI) that may be attributable to other disease processes 
(e.g., BPH ). The patients will be administered the D PSQ at screening, daily while on study drug, 
and at EOT, TOC , and LFU visits . The data collected from the questionnaires will be used to 
programm atically assess the symptomatic clinical response as defined in Table  4 and Table  5. 
Instructions for performing the PPSQ and DPSQ are detailed in Appendix 2. 
The DPSQ should also be performed at any unscheduled visit occurring for any reason between 
the EOT and TOC visits and/or between the TOC and LFU visits .

Confidential  Page 66 of 101   per-patient micro biological response in the microITT population at EOT and LFU and in ME 
population at EOT, TOC , and LFU are secondary outcomes. Microbiological response will be 
assessed per -pathogen and per -patient according to the definitions below. Microbiological 
outcome per- patient is assessed in a blinded manner.  It is based on outcome per-pathogen 
isolated at the initial visit (considered as causative ) and on the isolation of pathogens during the 
course of treatment or the posttreatment period. 
Each baseline pathogen will be categorized at EOT, TOC, and LFU visits according to the 
microbiological response  criteria shown in Table  6. 
Table  6 Microbiological Response Criteria  
Microbiological Response  Definition  
Eradication  Demonstration that the bacterial pathogen found at study entry 
(≥105 CFU/mL ) is eradicated  to <103 CFU/mL  
Persistence  Demonstration that the bacterial pathogen found at study entry 
(≥105 CFU/mL)  grows ≥103 CFU/mL  
Indeterminate microbiological response  Repeat cultures are not performed  
CFU=colony  forming unit.  
For patients from whom more than [ADDRESS_142175] sustained eradication at the LFU visit if their response was eradication at the TOC visit and is eradication at the LFU visit.  
Pathogens identified in blood will be assigned a per -pathogen microbiologic response . In 
instances of cUTI with bacteremia, a favorable outcome for a baseline pathogen will require a favorable microbiologic response from the urine sample  as well as the blood . 
7.7.3 Other Microbiological Outcomes

In patients with persistence, MICs of study drugs against pathogens isolated at baseline will be 
compared to MICs of study drugs against postbaseline pathogens. An outcome of persistence with increasing MIC is indicat ed by t he organism displaying a ≥4-fold higher MIC to study drug 
received in a urine or blood culture o btained at EOT or later compared to baseline.  
7.7.4 Specimen Collection and Analysis  
Detailed instructions for the collection, storage, and transport of specimens are provided in the laboratory manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Urine Specimen  
An adequate urine specimen for microbiologic evaluation must be obtained and sent to the local laboratory for culture, identification, and in vitro  antibacterial susceptibility testing per 
institutional operating procedures at screening  prior to randomization and at EOT, TOC, and 
LFU  visits . 
Urine samples should not be obtained from urinary catheter bags. Acceptable methods of collection of urine for culture include the following:  
• Midstream clean catch (straight catheterization using sterile technique is  preferred for 
female patients)   
• Straight catheter ization using sterile technique 
• Suprapubic specimen col lection using sterile  technique  
• Whenever possible, urine specimens should not be obtained from indwelling bladder catheters. When necessary, urine specimens in patients with indwelling bladder catheters should be obtained by [CONTACT_126280][INVESTIGATOR_126246] a needle and syringe if a port is not present.  
The urine specimen should be plated for culture within 2 hours from the collection time, if the specimen is kept at r oom temperature. Alternatively, these tests may be performed within 
24 hours of collection if the specimen is stored at 2°C to 8°C before processing. Refer to the laboratory manual for specimen storage and handling instructions.

samples from which more than 2 pathogens were isolated may be considered to represent contamination. 
All cultured isolates should be kept by [CONTACT_126282] y manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood C ultures  
Blood samples for microscopic evaluation, culture, identification , and in vitro  susceptibility 
testing will be collected at screening  for all patients  and processed at the local microbiology 
laboratory per institutional SOPs . Postbaseline, blood cultures will be performed as clinically 
indicated. For patients with positive baseline blood cultures, cultures will be repeated every 2 to 3 days until negative.  
Two sets of blood cultures should be collected from 2 different sites for aerobic incubation and, 
if possible, anaerobic incubation (i.e., 4 tubes). Each bottle should be inoculated with [ADDRESS_142177] 1 set of blood cultures 
should be obtained through a venipuncture. Details concerning the collection  and processing  of 
blood cultures are provided in the laboratory manual. 
Isolated pathogens will be sent to the central microbiology laboratory where pathogen 
identification will be confirmed and further susceptibility testing and characterization will be performed. Bacteria not considered pathogens (i.e., contaminants) should not be sent to the central laboratory.  
Blood specimens should be processed according to recognized methods for aerobic and 
anaerobic organisms (e.g., as found in Jorgensen JH  and Pfaller MA , Manual of Clinical 
Microbiology
5; Leber AL , Clinical Microbiology Procedures Handbook6) following the SOPs  of 
the qualified clinical microbiology laboratory at each study site. Microscopic evaluation and culture of specimens will be perfo rmed by [CONTACT_126283], along with 
susceptibility testing of pathogens cultured from the specimens if such testing is consistent with standard procedures at the institution.

judgment, has any of the following characteristics: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (This refers to an event in which the patient is at risk of death at the 
time of the event ; it do es not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it w as more severe) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a medical reason or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (T his refers to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_126252]. Note:

are ongoing at the time of the LFU visit will be followed until resolution, stabilization with 
sequelae, or death. SAEs that begin after the patient’s participation in the study is complete, but that the investigator considers to be related to study drug, should be reported. 
The investigator or study site personnel should notify the appropriate sponsor/contract research organization (CRO) pharmacovigilance representatives  of all SAEs , regardless of relationship to 
study drug, within [ADDRESS_142194] include the investigator ’s assessm ent of the relationship of the event to study drug  and must

8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events 
8.3.1 Assessment of Intensity  
The severity of AEs will be assessed  as mild , moderate, or severe according to the criteria below:  
• Mild: patient has awareness of signs or symptoms, but they are easily tolerated and of minor irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require treatment or medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are trans ient. 
• Moderate: event introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and may interfere with daily activities but is usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; the event may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe: event in terrupts the patient’s normal daily activities and generally requires 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment; the event may be incapacitating.  
It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of severity: thus, a severe AE is not necessarily serious. F or example, itching for several days may be rated as severe but may not be clinically 
serious.  
8.3.2 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator will assess the causal relationship between study drug and each AE and answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you cons ider that there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257] ?”

8.6.1 Laboratory Abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities should be reported as adverse events if the result is considered to be 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_093].  Clinically significant abnormal clinical laboratory 
findings or other abnormal assessments that are associated with the disease being  studied (unless 
judged by [CONTACT_126286]’s condition) or that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs. 
8.6.[ADDRESS_142196]  
Disease progression or deterioration of the patient’s condition due to lack of improvement or 
worsening of the cUTI may or may not reflect failure of the study drug. Insufficient therapeutic effect will be captured as an efficacy outcome. Therefore,  clinical and microbiologic al failures 
should not be reported as an AE. Further more , any event or extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_126255] (i.e., not by [CONTACT_126287]). Events that are a direct result of progression of the cUTI that progress to death will not be reported as SAEs but will instead be reported on a separate death  
form.

24 hours of becoming aware of either of the following findings based on local or central 
laboratory testing results:  
• AST or ALT ≥3× ULN and total bilirubin ≥2× ULN , OR  
• ALT or AST ≥10× ULN 
In cases meeting either of the above criteria (based on central or local laboratory results), the invest igator must complete the liver enzyme eCRF. Appendix [ADDRESS_142197] that should be considered. If any diagnostic testing is performed, the results should be reported in the eCRF. Liver laboratory results should be followed locally over several days until resolution or stabilization of the laboratory abnormalities and should be documented in

If a nonserious or serious AE is associated with the laboratory abnormalities, it should be reported separately as described in Section 8. 
9.2 Overdose  
Overdose is defined as administration of more than the intended dose in any given infusion of 
study drug or more than 4 infusions of study drug in a given 24-hour period. Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirmed) must be communicated to the sponsor or a specified designee within 24 hours and be fully documented. Overdose is not necessarily an AE, but if the consequences of the overdose result in a serious or nonserious AE, they should be reported as such, separate from the overdose. Details of any signs or symptoms and their management should be recorded including details of any antidote(s) administered.

Instructions to Read to the P atient : 
This questionnaire asks about symptoms you might be suffering from due to your current urinary 
tract infection . Some symptoms that we will ask about can be caused by [CONTACT_126302] a urinary tract infection. That’s why we want to know what you experience when you do not 
have a urinary tract infection.  
You may have some of these symptoms when you don’t have a urinary tract infection . In some 
cases, you may have some of these symptoms, but they could have gotten worse with your urinary tract infection .  
Please respond whether you have had any of the following symptoms before the start of your current urinary tract infection started and how severe those symptoms were.  In other words, tell 
us whether you have any of these symptoms when you are not suffering from a urinary tract infection. 
Answer each question by [CONTACT_126303]: no 
symptoms, mild symptoms, moderate symptoms, or severe symptoms. When answering these questions, don’t think about how you feel now. Think about how you felt before the start of your current urinary tract infection .

Confidential  Page 101 of 101   APPENDIX 3.  RECOMMENDED LABORATORY TESTING IN PATIENTS WITH 
ELEVATED LIVER ENZYM ES 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor or sponsor representative within 
24 hours of becoming aware of either of the following based on local or central laboratory testing results:  
• AST or ALT ≥ 3× ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2× ULN, OR  
• AST or ALT ≥ 10× ULN 
When the investigator indicates that either of these criteria have been met in the EDC system (Medidata/RA VE™), an automatic notification will be sent to the Covance PV  & DSS team.  
In all cases, the investigator should: 
• Assess the patient for risk factors for liver enzyme abnormalities (e.g., heavy alcohol use, history of intravenous drug use, hypertriglyceridemia, history of hepatitis B or C infection, other) 
• Evaluate for signs and symptoms of liver disease, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness, fever, or rash 
• Re-evaluate liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin [total, direct, 
and indirect]) at a local laboratory until resolution or stabilization. The suggested frequency is approximately every [ADDRESS_142218] improved and less often thereafter until resolution or stabilization. The local laboratory 
results should be documented in the local laboratory eCRF.  
In addition, the following recommended diagnostic tests may be considered: 
Hepatitis A (IgG, IgM)  Antinuclear antibodies  
Hepatitis B (HBsAb, HBcAb, HBeAg, HBsAg, HBV  DNA) Antimitochondrial antibodies  
Hepatitis C (HCV Ab, HCV RNA)  Iron studies (serum iron, serum ferritin, total 
iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation)  
Cytomegalovirus serology  Liver ultrasound  
Epstein -Barr virus serology   
DNA=deoxyribonucleic acid; HBcAb=hepatitis B core antibody; HBeAg=hepatitis B e antigen; HBsAb=hepatitis B; 
HBsAg=hepatitis B surface antibody; HBV=hepatitis B virus; HCV Ab=hepatitis C virus antibody; HCV  RNA=hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid; Ig=immunog lobulin.

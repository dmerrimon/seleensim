Protocol Title:   Extension Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Elagolix in Premenopausal 
Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Uterine Fibroids
Objective:
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of elagolix administered 
alone and in combination with add-back therapy (estradiol/norethindrone acetate or E2/NETA) to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids for up to 12 months (initial 6 months if on active treatment in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688] M12-815 or Study M12-817 and an additional 6 months in this Extension Study).
The study will also evaluate the effects of the treatment regimens on hypoestrogenic side effects, 
changes in bone mineral density (BMD) as assessed by [CONTACT_201215] X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), and vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flush.
Investigators:   Multicenter trial.  Investigator information is on file at [COMPANY_013].
Study Sites:   Approximately 250 sites
Study Population:   Subjects who completed the 6-month Treatment Period of their respective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_311884], have signed informed consent and meet eligibility criteria will be eligible for participation into this Extension Study.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 400
Methodology:
This Extension Study is designed to:
!Obtain 6 months of treatment data in subjects who were randomized to placebo in one of the 
two Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807366] 6 months of treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD.
!Obtain 12 months of continuous treatment data in subjects who received elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD for6 months in one of the two Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807367] 6 months of the same treatment in this study.
!Obtain data on endometrial health (TAU, TVU and endometrial biopsy).
!Assess bone mineral density, bone health and general safety with long-term treatment and recovery during Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period (up to 12-Months of 
Treatment and 12-Months of Post-Treatment Follow-Up).

Methodology (Continued):
Following completion of the 6-Month Treatment Period, all subjects will then enter into a 12-Month 
(48 weeks) Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  A pproximately 400 subjects will be enrolled in this 
Extension Study.  Among them, those subjects who received elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807368] a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two treatment groups:
!elagolix 300 mg BID 
!elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD
Study Duration:
The total duration for this Extension Study is approximately 18 months.
The study consists of 2 periods:
1.) 6-Month Treatment Period; and2.) 12-Month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.
Treatment Period:
!After providing informed consent and meeting eligibility criteria, subjects will enter a 6-Month 
(24 weeks) Treatment Period.
!Subjects who received placebo during the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807369] 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD during the Treatment Period.
!Subjects who received elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD during their respective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807370].
During the Treatment Period, subjects will be required to return to the study site monthly.  Study visits will occur at Day 1, and then monthly (28-day intervals) at Month [ADDRESS_1114864] Collection Visit or for a Premature Discontinuation Visit.
At each monthly visit during the Treatment Period, except Treatment Month 6, a 1-Month supply of 
study drug will be dispensed, urine and/or serum pregnancy testing will be performed, and contraception counseling will occur.  All subjects will self-administer study drug, elagolix 300 mg twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening approximately 12 hours apart) and E2/NETA or matching Placebo 
once daily (in the morning) orally throughout the 6-Month Treatment Period.

Treatment Period (Continued):
Treatment Period Assessments:
Sanitary product collection kits will continue to be dispensed at all Treatment Period Visits in this 
Extension Study.  Subjects will be required to collect all sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting and return them to the Clinical Study Site, either during a scheduled Monthly Visit or at a Product Collection Visit. Subjects must be instructed to collect and return all used or worn 
products even if there is no visible blood on the products.   If a subject does not return a sanitary 
product collection keg at any site visit (scheduled Monthly Visit, Product Collection Visit, Unscheduled Visit, or Premature Discontinuation Visit), the Site Staff will administer the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ) to record if subject had any bleeding or spotting since the last Study Visit.  If the subject had bleeding or spotting since the last Study Visit, the Site Staff will record the subjects response indicating why she did not collect products or return a sanitary product collection keg.
A pelvic ultrasound will be performed in all subjects at Month 3, Month [ADDRESS_1114865] fibroid, uterine volume, endometrial thickness and potential presence of ovarian and uterine pathology.  During the Treatment Period, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) in a subset of subjects will be conducted at Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation Visit, if applicable, to assess fibroid and uterine volume.  An endometrial biopsy will be performed in all subjects at the Month 6 or at the Premature Discontinuation Visit (if the subject prematurely discontinues after the Month 3 Visit).
Subjects who enter the Extension Study with BMD decrease < 5% in both spi[INVESTIGATOR_807371] 
a DXA scan at Month 6.  Subjects who enter the Extension Study with BMD decrease ≥ 5% in spi[INVESTIGATOR_807372] a DXA scan at Month 3 of this Extension Study.  If the Month 3 DXA scan shows BMD decrease < 8% in spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, and femoral neck, the subject can continue in the Extension Study with a DXA scan to be performed at Month 6.  If, however, the Month 3 DXA scan shows BMD decrease ≥8% in spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, or femoral neck, the subject must discontinue treatment and enter the Post-
Treatment Follow-Up Period.
Sites will continue to collect concomitant medications and assess for adverse events at every visit.
Subjects will be asked to complete several patient-re ported outcome questionnaires, such as the EQ-5D-
5L, Uterine Fibroid Symptom Questionnaire (UFS-QoL), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment 
(WPAI) questionnaire, Health Care Resource Utilization questionnaire (HCRU), C-SSRS – Since Last Visit questionnaire and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), based on bleeding and non-bleeding uterine fibroid symptoms.  Site Staff will administer the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ), as applicable and the HCRU. 
Pregnancy (urine and/or serum) tests will be performed at each visit throughout the study.  Subjects will 
continue to be required to participate in contraceptive counseling, and at each visit will be reminded of the importance of using appropriate and effective forms of dual non-hormonal contraceptives to promote pregnancy prevention.
During the Treatment Period, blood samples will be collected to assay for serum estradiol and 
progesterone, and to measure plasma concentrations of elagolix and NETA, as well as blood samples for clinical safety labs, (including lipid panel) will be collected during the study.

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids (leiomyomata) are the most common benign tumors in women and occur 
in up to 80% of women of reproductive age.[ADDRESS_1114895] of symptomatic uterine fibroids exceeds $2 billion per year in the [LOCATION_002].
4
The growth of uterine fibroids is highly dependent on both estrogen and progesterone.5
Although often asymptomatic, fibroids may cause symptoms severe enough to warrant therapy in 20% to 50% of women
3and the most common symptom is heavy or prolonged 
menstrual bleeding.  Other symptoms may include anemia, pelvic pressure and pelvic organ compression, back pain, and adverse reproductive outcomes.  Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) (menorrhagia, defined as > 80 mL per menstrual cycle)
1is extremely 
inconvenient, can significantly impact quality of life and may lead to iron-deficiency anemia.
The choice of treatment is based on individual symptoms, patient preference, and the 
desire to preserve either fertility or the uterus or both.  Histor ically, hysterectomy or 
myomectomy were the preferred treatment opti ons for women with symptomatic uterine 
fibroids.
2  However, surgery is also associated with risks such as infections, bleeding 
complications, thromboembolic effects, scarring/adhesions, and even increased mortality.[ADDRESS_1114896] been proposed and studied including semi-invasive procedures, such as uterine artery embo lization and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI)-guided high-intensi ty focused ultrasound ablation therapy as 
well as nonsurgical, medical treatments.  There is no long-term medical treatment for 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1

symptomatic uterine fibroids.  Treatment with GnRH agonists such as Lupron®is 
effective but induces full gonadal suppression and menopause-like symptoms that limit 
their use to 3 months of presurgical treatment.  High-dose progestins, oral contraceptives and tranexamic acid (Lysteda
®-an antifibrinolytic drug) are used for short-term 
management of heavy uterine bleeding only.  Recently, the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), ulipristal acetate, has been approved in the EU as a short-term preoperative treatment, as well as an extended intermittent treatment of women with of symptomatic uterine fibroids.
The ideal medical treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids, as an alternative to surgical 
interventions, should control HMB, improve non-bleeding symptoms and quality of life, 
and prove safe and tolerable as a chronic therapy.  Unfortunately, currently available medical options provide only short-term improvement of symptoms, and as such, are only indicated prior to surgery, and/or their side-effects limit their long-term use.  A safe and effective chronic medical therapy for the management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids, as an alternative to hysterectomy or other surgical intervention, has not yet been approved.
3.2 Elagolix
Elagolix is an orally active, non-peptide (GnRH ) antagonist that is being developed by 
[CONTACT_112736]-related pain and the chronic management of 
HMB associated with symptomatic uterine fi broids.  The initial preclinical and clinical 
evaluation of elagolix was conducted by [CONTACT_807411]. (NBI).  Safety 
results from these studies show that elagolix  is generally well tolerated.  Elagolix, unlike 
injectable GnRH analogs, produces a dose dependent suppression of pi[INVESTIGATOR_807380], i.e., from partial ovarian suppression at lower doses to full suppression at higher doses.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical t oxico logy, 
metabolism, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of elagolix in humans and a summary of clinical studies can be found in the Investigator's Brochure and is also discussed in lesser detail in Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.2.2 .

Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1

The initial 3-month, Phase 2a , dose-finding, POC study (Study M12-663) evaluated total 
daily doses (TDDs) of elagolix of 200, 400, and [ADDRESS_1114897] met the agreed-upon dos e selection criteria for Phase 2b and Phase 3 
(predicated on a dose in Phase 2a that provided the most robust response [responder rates of approximately > 80% for the composite bleed ing assessment] and an acceptable safety 
and bleeding profile for the majority of women).  It was known that to support long-term dosing with elagolix at these higher doses, low dose hormonal add-back therapy would be required to mitigate bone loss and minimize other hypoestrogenic adverse events, e.g., hot flush.
Subsequently, a 6-month safety and efficacy Phase 2b study (Study M12-813) evaluating 
elagolix TDD of 600 mg (administered as 300 mg BID in Cohort 1 or 600 mg QD in Cohort 2) with and without add-back thera py was conducted.  As add- back therapy, the 
study evaluated two doses of E2/NETA (low dose, 0.5 mg/0.[ADDRESS_1114898] dose, 1 mg/0.5 mg).  Preliminary results from Cohort 1 demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID alone and in combin ation with E2/NETA provided robust efficacy 
in controlling HMB associated with uterine fibroids and provided an acceptable safety/tolerability profile that could potentially support the proposed chronic use indication.  While similar efficacy results were noted in Cohort 2 (elagolix 600 mg QD),review of the totality of data (preclinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2) comparing two dosing regimens support selection of the 300 mg BID + standard dose E2/NETA as the regimen for Phase 3.
Additional details on rationale for dose selection are included in Section 5.6.4 .
3.2.1 Preclinical Experience
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicology
Elagolix has been well characterized in repeated-dose animal toxicity studies of up to 
15 weeks in mouse, 28 weeks in rat, 39 weeks (9 months) in dog and 13 weeks in monkey. 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
27
The safety margin for the 200 mg BID human dose for the endometriosis indication is 
approximately 8.6 (28 week rate study) and 7.5 (9 month dog study).
There were no significant findings from in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies.  Also, 
there was no significant increase in tumors in the 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study with 
elagolix sodium.  In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study increase in thyroid or liver tumors was rat specific with no risk anticipated for human.
Elagolix is not teratogenic (no fetal abnormalities in preclinical studies) based on data 
from the rat and rabbit Segment II studies).  However, there were non-teratogenic findings, e.g., observations of abortions in rabbit and post-implantation loss in rat at higher doses.  These could either be due to maternal toxicity or related to indirect pharmacological activity.  
Please refer to the most recent edition of the elagolix Investigator Brochure for complete 
information on toxicology studies for elagolix.
3.2.2 Clinical Experience
Refer to Edition 15 of the elagolix Investigator's Brochure (April [ADDRESS_1114899] recent 
version) for the complete information on clinical studies, exposure to study drug, and safety.
Clinical Program Overview
As of [ADDRESS_1114900] 1 dose of elagolix 
in clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_112738] (30 Phase 1 studies, 6 Phase 2 endometriosis studies, 2 Phase 2 uterine fibroid studies [Studi es M12-663 and M12-813], 
and 1 ongoing Phase 3 endometriosis extension study [Study M12-665] and 2 ongoing Phase 3 endometriosis extension studies [Studies M12-667 and M12-821]).  More than 
1,000 of these subjects were dosed for ≥ 6 weeks.  Of the 3,417 subjects, 95 were healthy 
men, 795 were healthy women, 1,296 were women with endometriosis, 221 were women with uterine fibroids, 16 were women with hepatic impairment, and 9 were women with

renal impairment.  In ongoing studies (including 2 extension studies mentioned above and 
excluding Study M12-671), more than 1,[ADDRESS_1114901] 1 dose of elagolix.
Twelve Phase 1 clinical studies (7 in healthy men and 5 in healthy women) and 6 Phase 2 
studies (in women with endometriosis) were  completed by [CONTACT_11148].  To date, [ADDRESS_1114902] been completed by [CONTACT_26282], Study M12-663 and Study M12-813.  The Phase 3 uterine fibroid registration program consists of 2 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_20533], Study M12-815 and Study M12-817, and a single planned associated 6-month safety/eff icacy extension study, Study M12-816.
Clinical Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Summary
Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies indicate that elagolix is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24577] (GI) with time to maximum plasma concentration (T
max) of 
approximately 1 hour for immediate rel ease (IR) tablet formulations.  The following 
points are key findings of elagolix PK:
●Elagolix exposure (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve 
[AUC] and maximum concentration in plasma [C max]) appears to be 
approximately dose-proportional across the daily dose range studied (25 to 
400 mg).  At single daily doses of 600 mg and a bove, more than dose 
proportional increases in elago lix exposures were observed.
●Elagolix displays biphasic disposition with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 4 – 6 hours.  Little or no accumulation resulted from BID 
(400 mg BID), or once daily (QD) (400 mg QD) dosing at steady state which is not deemed clinically relevant.
●Food decreases the AUC of the immediate-release tablet formulation by [CONTACT_3450] 25%.
Elagolix (ABT-620)

●Elagolix is a substrate of CYP3A and P-gp and may be a weak inducer of 
CYP3A enzymes.
●Elagolix is primarily excreted in feces as metabolites (64%) and parent compound (26%).  Less than 3% is excreted unchanged in the urine.  Plasma 
exposure of elagolix metabolites was low (< 3% of each metabolite) relative to the parent.
Pharmacodynamic data from the [COMPANY_013] multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study, 
Study M12-790, in premenopausal healthy female subjects showed a dose-dependent suppression of E2, reaching maximum suppression at approximately 200 mg BID.  Anovulatory progesterone levels were observed through Day 21 in all subjects at doses as low as 100 mg BID.  In addition, luteinizing hormone (LH) and fo llicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH) decline in a dose dependent manner, with maximal suppression and near 
maximal suppression, respectively, at [ADDRESS_1114903] 1 ovulation during the 3 months of elagolix treatment was 47.4% to 57.1%, and the percentage of subjects with ovulation was 28.1% to 33.3% within each month (28-day period).  In contrast, when ovulation rates are counted by [CONTACT_112739], the [ADDRESS_1114904] a slightly lower ovulation rate than 200 mg BID (27% versus 32%), and when the standard-dose estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg (standard-dose E2/NETA) was co-administered with elagolix 300 mg BID, the ovulation rate decreased further to approximately 10%. 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-[ADDRESS_1114905] common adverse events overall in the 3,417 subjects 
who received elagolix across all clinical studies were hot flush (598/3,417; 17.5%), headache (546/3,417; 16.0%), and nausea (411/3,417; 12%).  These are also the adverse events that most commonly resulted in discontinuation from study:  hot flush in 33 subjects (1.0%), headache in 15 subjects (0.4%), and nausea in 16 subjects (0.5%).
Adverse Events in Phase [ADDRESS_1114906] commonly reported adverse event in all the elagolix treatment cohorts was hot flush; this was reported for approximately 45% to 63% of the subjects in the cohorts in which elagolix was administered alone.  The use of both add-back therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [elagolix 200 mg BID + LD (low-dose) E2/NETA QD and elagolix 300 mg BID + cyclical EP] was associated with an approx imate 30% lower overall incidence of hot flush that was 
approximately 30% lower relative to the corresponding elagolix treatment regimen alone.
Other than hot flushes, the only other adverse events in the elagolix 300 mg BID group 
reported for more than 2 subjects were h eadache (6 subjects, 20%), and abdominal pain 
and dizziness (3 subjects each, 10%).  At the 600 mg QD dose of elagolix, the presence of nausea (9 subjects), headache (9 subjects), dizziness (6 subjects), and back pain (5 subjects) was more prevalent than in  the remaining elagolix treatment cohorts.
Study M12-813
Preliminary data from the completed Phase 2b study, Study M12-813, show that, overall, 
the percentage of subjects who reported treatment-emergent adverse events was generally similar across all treatment groups in both cohorts, ranging from 67.9% to 87.0%, with the highest values in the elagolix alone groups (300 mg BID, 80.0%; 600 mg QD, 87.0%).  
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-[ADDRESS_1114907] common adverse events in both cohorts were hot flush, insomnia, and headache.  
The rates for hot flush in Cohort 1 were 3.1% for placebo and 44.6% for elagolix [ADDRESS_1114908]-dose E2/NETA significantly decreased the rates by [CONTACT_3450] 20% and 34%, respectively (25.0% for elagolix 300 mg BID + low-dose E2/NETA and 10.8% for elagolix 300 mg BID + standard-dose E2/NETA).  In Cohort 2, the rates of hot flush were 5.1% for placebo and 49.4% for elagolix [ADDRESS_1114909]-dose E2/NETA significantly decreased the rates by [CONTACT_3450] 31% and 35%, respectively (18.4% for elagolix 600 mg QD + low-dose E2/NETA and 14.3% for elagolix 600 mg QD + standard-dose E2/NETA). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest in elagolix clinical studies include mood changing 
disorders (suicidality and depression), cutane ous adverse events, hot flush, ovarian-related 
events, BMD decrease and fractures, uterine bleeding and changes in serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  In the completed Phase 2 studies in uterine fibroids, there was a higher percentage of women experiencing cutaneous/hypersensitivity ev ents and hot flush with elagolix treatment 
compared with placebo.  Adverse events of special interest are monitored continuously in all clinical studies.
Serious Adverse Events
As of [ADDRESS_1114910] been reported by 92/3,417 (2.7%) subjects who received elagolix.  Serious adverse events in all completed studies and in ongoing Studies M12-[ADDRESS_1114911] common serious adverse event was pelvic pain occurring in 8 subjects (0.2%) followed by [CONTACT_807412] 4 subjects (0.2%) and spontaneous abortion and endometriosis, each occurring in 5 subjects (0.1%), and abdominal pain and uterine leiomyoma, each occurring in 4 subjects (0.1%).  Among women participating in elagolix clinical trials, one subject delivered an infant with congenital pneumonia.  During the Phase 2 clinical development

program in endometriosis, there were 2 pre gnancy-related serious adverse events 
(congenital malformations, i.e., 1 cleft palate and 1 tracheoesophageal fistula), which 
occurred during treatment and were assessed as unrelated to elagolix.
In the completed Phase 2a study in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids, 
there were [ADDRESS_1114912] dose in 8 subjects randomized to receive active treatment.  Four events occurred in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone arm [pulmonary embolis m, deep vein thrombosis (both events 
experienced by [CONTACT_112741]), menorrhagia and endometrial adenocarcinoma]; 2 events occurred in the 300 mg BID plus low-dose activella arm (uterine leiomyoma and hypertension), and [ADDRESS_1114913]-dose activella arm (anemia).
Effects of Elagolix on Bone Mineral Density (BMD)
The effects of elagolix [ADDRESS_1114914] 
dose E2/NETA were evaluated in the 6-month Phase 2b study (Study M12-813).  BMD was assessed at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1-L4), femoral neck, and total hip via DXA at Screening and at Month 6 of the Treatment Period, or Premature Discontinuation.
Preliminary results from the 6-month Phase 2b uterine fibroid study, Study M12-813, 
demonstrate that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID and 600 mg QD, significantly decrease BMD, which is partially mitigated by  [CONTACT_68016] E2/NETA in a dose-dependent 
manner.  In Cohort 1, the mean percentage change from Baseline to Month 6 in BMD in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_112699] 300 mg BI D alone group was –3.8% at Month 6; 19% of 
subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 25% had > 5% to < 8% BMD decrease, and 8% 
had a ≥ 8% BMD decrease.

While the addition of low-dose E2/NETA partially prevented BMD loss at the lumbar

In the E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) group 8.2% of subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, [ADDRESS_1114915] (2%) had a 5% – 8% BMD decrease and no subjects 
(0%) had ≥ 8% BMD decrease at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].
Effects of Elagolix on Clinical Laboratory Parameters
Data from the Phase 2 studies with elagolix in women with uterine fibroids showed dose-dependent increases in serum lipid parameters, corresponding to the degree of estrogen suppression and similar to those seen with other GnRH analogs.  Changes in serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], in particular total cholesterol and low-de nsity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), were 
observed in this study, similar to those observed in postmenopausal women
8and these 
changes, as expected, were somewhat attenuated by E2/NETA in a dose-dependent manner.  Mean percentage increases from Baseline in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C, and triglycerides were observed across each of 
the elagolix treatment groups over the 6-month treatment duration.  Ongoing clinical trials with elagolix suggest similar findings, again which are consistent with those noted with other GnRH analogs.  While the significance of these lipid changes in premenopausal women with low-risk baseline lipid values is unknown, further monitoring and evaluation is needed.  In all these studies, the increased lipid values usually occur during the first [ADDRESS_1114916] shown that overall, patients on elagolix experienced fewer days 
of bleeding per month, reduced bleeding intensity, and extended intervals between bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_807381].  Some subjects experienced periods

Of subjects who received elagolix and we re amenorrheic upon entering the Post-treatment 
Follow-Up Period, the majority of subjects (52% in Cohort 1 and 59% in Cohort 2) returned to menses at Month, and an additional 42% in Cohort 1 and 38% in Cohort 2 returned to menses at Month 2.
Endometrial Safety in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids
Study M12-813 
Endometrial biopsies were conducted at Baseline and at Month 6 in Study M12-813.  
Preliminary results from Cohort 1 show that, among subjects in elagolix treatment groups, 39% to 43% had normal quiescent/minimally stimulated endometrium and 14% to 28% had normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically significant findings were observed.
Preliminary results from Cohort 2 are similar.  Among subjects in elagolix treatment 
groups, 21% to 36% had normal quiescent/minimally stimulated endometrium and 20% to 32% had normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically significant findings were observed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy in Elagolix Studies
Pregnancies Outcomes (Across the Entire Elagolix Clinical Development Program)
The mechanism of action of elagolix, bleeding pattern, and the indirect evidence for 
follicular escapes (high E2 and progesterone values) indicate that elagolix does not consistently inhibit ovulation and as discussed in Section 3.2.[ADDRESS_1114918] been reported among women participating 
in elagolix clinical trials, including 104 that occurred off-treatment ([ADDRESS_1114919]-Treatment [had a conception date more than [ADDRESS_1114920] dose of study drug]) and 68 On-Treatment (i.e., had conception date during the Treatment Period with study drug or were deemed to have a conception date within [ADDRESS_1114921] dose of study drug).  Among the 68 on-treatment pregnancies, 21 subjects had no exposure to elagolix ([ADDRESS_1114922] treated with oral contraceptives only).  The remaining 47 on-treatment pregnancies were  in elagolix-treated 
subjects, and 21were carried to term, with 18 subjects delivering live infants without complications (1 pair of twins).  One subject delivered an infant with meconium aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499] (MedDRA preferred term = congenital pneumonia).  Two subjects who received 150 mg elagolix QD in Phase 2 e ndometriosis studies delivered infants with 
congenital anomalies:  [ADDRESS_1114923] been reported in Study M12-671.  In the aforementioned Phase 2b UF study, 1 on-treatment pregnancy has been reported.

Women should also be counseled on the unknown, thus potential, risk to children born to mothers exposed to elagolix during pregnancy, including the possibility of malformations.
Efficacy in Phase 2 Uterine Fibroid Studies
The main objectives of the uterine fibroids Phase 2 program in premenopausal women 
were as follows:  1) to select the most appropriate dose(s) of el agolix to evaluate in 
Phase 2b and Phase 3 from both an efficacy and safety perspective, and 2) to assess the need for, adequacy, and type of add-back therapy to be used in conjunction with elagolix.  The first objective was accomplished in the 3-month Phase 2a, dose-ranging POC study, Study M12-663, and the second objective was acco mplished in both Phase 2 studies (need 
for and type of add-back in Phase 2a a nd adequacy of add-back therapy in Phase 2b 
[6-month safety and efficacy study]).
The Phase 2a dose-finding, POC study evaluated TDDs of elagolix of 200, 400, and 
600 mg in premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  While it was anticipated that some women would likely benefit (reduction in menstrual bleeding), even with low doses (TDD of 200 mg) of elagolix, the agreed-upon dose selection criteria for Phase 2b was predicated on a dose in Phase 2a that provided the most robust response (responder rates of approximately > 80% for the composite bleeding assessment) and an acceptable safety and bleeding profile for the majority of women.  It was known that to support long-term dosing with elagolix at th ese higher doses, hormone add-back therapy 
would be required for all of these.

All elagolix doses resulted in statistically superior reductions in the mean percentage of 
menstrual blood loss (MBL) from baseline measured by [CONTACT_112742], with the largest effect noted with the [ADDRESS_1114925] to the primary endpoint, the add-back therapy with low-dose E2/NETA or cyclical EP ha d marginal effects on the efficacy of elagolix.  Furthermore, co-
administration of low-dose E2/NETA or cyclical EP (progesterone administered from Day 17 through Day 28 per treatment cycle) had comparable efficacy on the percentage change in MBL or the percentage of subjects who met the composite bleeding endpoint (MBL volume of < 80 mL at the Final Month [last 28 days of treatment], and≥ 50% 
reduction in MBL volume from Baseline to the Final Month [last 28 days of treatment]) relative to elagolix administration alone.  When co-administered with elagolix (200 or 300 mg BID), both add-back therapy regimens were efficacious in reducing the percentage of moderate-to-severe bleeding da ys, with increases in bleeding days being 
primarily due to spotting.
Based on data from the Phase 2a study, a TDD of 600 mg and 2 doses of E2/NETA add-
back therapy (low-dose E2/NETA and standard-dose E2/NETA) were selected for Phase 2b.
The Phase 2b study evaluated the safety and efficacy of elagolix TDD of 600 mg 
administered either (QD or BID regimens), alone and in combination with 2 different strengths of E2/NETA in premenopausal women age [ADDRESS_1114926]-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  Cohort 1 
utilized elagolix 300 mg BID dosing (with and without add-back therapy) while Cohort 2 utilized elagolix 600 mg QD dosing (with and without add-back therapy).
The primary efficacy endpoint was the per centage of subjects meeting a composite 
endpoint consisting of 2 bleeding assessments:  MBL volume of < 80 mL at the Final 
Month (last 28 days of treatment), and≥ 50% reduction in MBL volume from Baseline to 
the Final Month (last 28 days of treatmen t).  The key secondary efficacy endpoints 
include change in fibroid and uterine volume by [CONTACT_2207] (and MRI in a subset), other

key bleeding assessments, specific non-bleeding assessments based on a Non-Bleeding 
Symptoms Uterine Fibroid Questionnaire (NBUFSQ), and other QOL variables including UFS-QOL.  The safety and tolerability objectives include the assessment of standard safety parameters, in addition to hypoestrogenic adverse events of interest, including BMD loss as assessed by [CONTACT_11323] x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and vasomotor 
symptoms, such as hot flush.  Endometrial health via transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) and endometrial biopsy are also evaluated.
Preliminary results from Cohort 1 demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA showed the following:
●Robust efficacy in controlling HMB (composite bleeding endpoint of 91.9%, 
85.5%, and 79% in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone, elagolix 300 mg BID plus 
low-dose E2/NETA, and elagolix [ADDRESS_1114927]-dose E2/NETA treatment groups, respectively) assoc iated with uterine fibroids
●Clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life measures and symptom severity scores as assessed by [CONTACT_112743]-QOL
●Mitigation of BMD loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], with standard-dose E2/NETA
●Substantial dose-dependent reducti on in the incidence of vasomotor 
symptoms, e.g., hot flushes
●No evidence of endometrial safety concerns
●Overall safety profile remains unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings to date.
Overall, preliminary findings from the Phas e 2b study suggest that standard-dose 
E2/NETA as add-back therapy may be effective in preventing BMD loss during treatment 
with elagolix [ADDRESS_1114928] on primary efficacy bleeding endpoints in premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  This dosing regimen could potentially meet the objective of a long-term therapy for the management 
of symptomatic uterine fibroids in premenopausal women.

Preliminary results from Study M12-813 show that all treatment arms (both doses of 
elagolix [300 mg BID and 600 mg QD] alone or in combination with either strength of E2/NETA) met the primary endpoint, which is the proportion of subjects who achieved an MBL volume of < 80 mL at the Final Month and 50% or greater reduction in MBL 
volume from Baseline to the Final Month compared to that of placebo (all P < 0.001), as measured by [CONTACT_112744].
[COMPANY_013] Ongoing Phase 3 Clinical Studies
Endometriosis
The Phase 3 endometriosis clinical development program is comprised of two 6-month 
replicate, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Pi[INVESTIGATOR_20533] (Studies M12-665 and M12-667), each with complimentary 6-mont h safety/efficacy extension studies 
(Studies M12-667 and M12-821).  The extension studies are ongoing.  The primary objective of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807382], tolerability, and efficacy, of elagolix, administered QD or BID compared to placebo, in the management of moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain while taking into account the use of rescue analgesics.  Secondary efficacy objectives include assessments of other endometriosis-related symptoms, analgesic use, as well as quality of life (QoL) endpoints.  The 6-month 
extension studies assess the long-term safety and efficacy of elagolix for a total treatment duration of up to 12 months.
Phase 3 Clinical Development Program for Uterine Fibroids 
The overall objective of the registration clinical development program is to generate 
requisite safety, tolerability, and efficacy data in 2 replicate 6-month Phase 3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807383], Studies M12-815 and M12-817, and 1 safety and efficacy Extension Study, 
Study M12-816 (to receive up to a total of 12 months of treatment) to support use of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) for the intended indication of the chronic management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids. 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-[ADDRESS_1114929]  completed the 6-month Treatment Period in 
one of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_20533] (Studies M12-815 or M12-817).  In this study, they will receive 
6 months of therapy, for a total of up to 12 months of active treatment for those 
randomized in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807384] a total of 6 months of treatment for those randomized to placebo in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_20533].
The primary objective of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_807385] 300 mg BID in combination with add-back therapy (E2/NETA) as compared to placebo to reduce HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  The goal of the Extension Study is to generate data that supports long-term use of elagolix 300 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA.
Given the difficulties with extending placebo for periods beyond [ADDRESS_1114930] dose E2/NETA on BMD over a 12-month treatment period, therefore the primary objectives of this Extension 
Study are to:
●Evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of elagolix administered alone and 
in combination with E2/NETA
●Reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids for up to 12 months (initial 6 months if on active treatment in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_311884] M12-815 or Study M12-817 and an additional 6 months in this Extension Study), and
●Further characterize the impact of E2/NETA on the safety and tolerability 
(including bone mineral density and other hypoestrogenic effects and efficacy 
of elagolix. 
3.3 Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate
E2/NETA (1 mg E2 and 0.5 mg NETA) is a continuous combined oral estrogen/progestin 
regimen.  E2/NETA is approved in the [LOCATION_002] as postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms

E2/NETA is also approved in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of moderate to severe 
symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause.
3.[ADDRESS_1114931] efficacy in reducing HMB, and E2/NETA is the optimal regimen for managing and limiti ng BMD loss, such that longer-term dosing 
is feasible.
Continued assessments of this treatment regimen in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 trials will provide 
the requisite data to support registration of elagolix 300 mg BID + E2/NETA as safe and 
efficacious treatment for the chronic management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids.
3.[ADDRESS_1114932] common symptom in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids is heavy 
menstrual bleeding (HMB).  A safe and effective chronic pharmacologic therapy for 
symptomatic uterine fibroids, as an alternative to hysterectomy or other surgical intervention, has not yet been approved, which is the objective of the Elagolix Phase 3 Clinical Development Program.  Results from Phase 2 studies in women with HMB associated with uterine fibro ids demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
alone and in combination with E2/NETA provided robust efficacy in reducing HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Importantly, when co-administered with elagolix 300 mg 
BID, E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD mitigated BMD loss observed with elagolix 300 mg BID alone a nd substantially other hypoestrogenic adverse 
events such as hot flushes.  Also co-administration of elagolix and E2/NETA attenuated increases in serum lipid parameters observed with elagolix 300 mg BID alone.  Furthermore, there was no evidence of endometrial safety concerns and the overall safety profile remained unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings to date.

This therapeutic approach, if successful, could provide an alternative to surgical 
interventions, and/or semi-invasive procedures as a chronic pharmacologic treatment for HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Based on the totality of data to date from the Phase 2 clinical development program, the overall benefit/risk profile of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA appears to be favorable for the chronic management of HMB associated with uterine fibro ids, and will be further defined in this Phase 3 trial.
4.0 Study Objective
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of elagolix administered alone and in combination with add-back therapy (estradiol/norethindrone acetate or E2/NETA) to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids for up to 12 months (initial 6 months if on active treatment in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688] M12-815 or Study M12-817 and an additional 6 months in this Extension Study).
The study will also evaluate the effects of the treatment regimens on hypoestrogenic side 
effects, changes in bone mineral density (BMD) as assessed by [CONTACT_201215] X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), and vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flush.

Pregnancy tests (urine and/or serum) will be performed at each visit throughout the study 
and subjects will be counseled at each visit on appropriate and effective forms of dual non-hormonal contraception to promote pregnancy prevention. 
Sanitary product collection kits will continue to  be dispensed at all Treatment Period 
Visits.  Subjects will be required to collect all sanitary products on days with menstrual 
bleeding or spotting throughout the Treatment Period.  Subjects will return sanitary 
products to the Clinical Study Site, either during a scheduled monthly visit or at a Product Collection Visit.  There may be an option f or subjects to have a Product Collection Visit 
conducted at home by a Home Health Care Agent.
As in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_20533], when a Subject does not return a sanitary product collection keg 
at any site visit (scheduled monthly vis it or at time of Premature Discontinuation, Product 
Collection Visit or Unscheduled Visit) during the Treatment Period, the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ) will be administered by [CONTACT_112745].  If the subject had bleeding or spotting, she will be asked why she did not return a sanitary product collection keg.  The subject's responses will be recorded on the UBQ by [CONTACT_112746].
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed during the Treatment Period as 
outlined in Appendix C .
Subjects will continue the use of dual non-hormonal contraception and receive counseling on the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective use of birth control.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatmen t Period will be asked to complete 
Premature Discontinuation procedures and en ter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.

5.2.3 Contraception Recommendations and Pregnancy Testing
Contraception Counseling/Dispense Contraceptives
Subjects (excluding those subjects who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal 
occlusion) will continue to be counseled at every visit throughout their participation in the study on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the use of appropriate and effective 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-[ADDRESS_1114966] agree to use two forms of non-hormonal contraception (dual contraception) 
consistently throughout the Treatment Period and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods 
(Subjects may begin the use of hormonal contraception (e.g., oral or IUD) after completing the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month [ADDRESS_1114967] returned sanitary products for a full menses).
Acceptable methods of dual non-hormonal contraception include the following 
combinations:
●Condom with spermicide (foam, gel, or polymer film)
●Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
●Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
Subjects are not required to use dual contraception methods if:
●Sexual partner(s) is vasectomized at least 6 months prior to Screening
●Subject practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as the preferred 
lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence is not acceptable
●Subject had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage 
methods such as Essure
®) at least 4 months prior to Screening.
●Subject is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual relationship(s) with men requires the use of dual non-hormonal contracep tion as indicated above.
Subjects may begin the use of hormonal contraception in place of dual non- hormonal 
contraception during the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period if they meet both of the 
following: 
●Completed the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and
●Returned sanitary products for a full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Period

M12-[ADDRESS_1114968] to 
confirm in writing her full awarene ss that the potential risks of study drug 
(elagolix) on the unborn child are unknown and therefore she must not get pregnant during the entire time of study participation, and that she agrees to consistently use dual non-hormonal contracep tion throughout her study participation (during the 
Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.
2. The Investigator or designated study staff will counsel the subject that the study 
drug is not contraceptive, that ovulation may occur even though the study drug may 
have altered menstrual cyclicity, and that fetal abnormalities have been observed in women who have received elagolix in clinical studies that were not deemed to be related to elagolix based on the totalit y of data; however, it is unknown whether 
these abnormalities were the result of taking elagolix.
3. The Sponsor will provide training materials to the sites for instructing subjects on 
the types of protocol-allowed contracepti on methods, their effectiveness and proper 
use.
●The Sponsor will provide sites with a supply of materials to promote 
pregnancy prevention, including contraceptives (condoms and spermicides), 
and lubricants to provide to subjects at no charge.  Subjects should only use the pregnancy prevention materials provided by [CONTACT_112754].
●Subjects will be allowed to choose a contraception method of their choice from 
the contraceptives provided by [CONTACT_112755].  The site will a ssess the subject's basic understanding of 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
58
the proper use through discussion and demonstration of proper techniques, 
including proper diaphragm use.
●The site will dispense contraceptives to subjects throughout Treatment and through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Peri od, as needed.  Subjects may begin 
the use of hormonal medication after completion of the Post-Treatment 
Follow-Up Month [ADDRESS_1114969] full menses.
●The source documents will capture date contraception counseling was 
performed, whether the subject is se xually active with men, the type of 
contraceptive used, a change in contraceptive method, use of a non-study 
supply brand, contraceptives provided to the subject, and the date supplies 
were provided.
●As appropriate, the subject will be asked to attest by [CONTACT_112756], and in a stand-alone attestation form at Day 1 and at the Month 6 or 
Premature Discontinuation study visit that allowable methods of contraception, 
as described during the pregnancy prevention counseling, are being practiced.
●For subjects who have had a bilateral tubal occlusion, attestation is only 
required to be collected once at the time of consent.
4. Subjects will be reminded to use dual non-hormonal contraception.
5. The study drug will be dispensed as a monthly supply at the beginning of each 
month during the Treatment Period to promote frequent interaction with site staff 
and opportunities for continued education.
6. At each visit, subjects will be asked to name [CONTACT_112809].

12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
During the Treatment Period, a resting 12-lead ECG will be conducted at the Month 6 
Visit or Premature Discontinuation Vi sit (if applicable) as indicated in Appendix C , Study 
Activities.
The Investigator or qualified designee at the study site will determine if any findings 
outside the normal physiological variation are clinically significant (in consultation with a 
cardiologist if necessary), and document this on the ECG tracing/report with signature [CONTACT_596126].  The original ECG tracing or a certified copy of the original tracing with the physician's assessment will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.  For ECG with QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) > 450 msec, the correction formula used (i.e., Bazett's or Fridericia's) and the corrected result should be recorded in source documents and eCRF.  The study site should use the same correction formula used in the respective pi[INVESTIGATOR_807393].
Mammogram
All subjects who had a mammogram performed to determine eligibility into their 
respective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688], will have a mammogram performed at Treatment Period Month 6 or at the Premature Discontinuation Visit if it has been approximately 12 months since the screening mammogram was performed.
Central Imaging Procedures
Fibroid and uterine assessments will be obtained using pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) 
throughout the study.  In addition to the TAU a nd TVU, an MRI will continue to be 
performed in the subset of subjects who consented and participated in the MRI Subset during their respective pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397].  The MRI subset will continue to evaluate uterine fibroid size and volume and uterine volume using another technique in addition to

All ultrasound and MRI images will be sent to the Central Imaging Core Lab (ICL) for 
review to monitor safety during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU) and/or SIS and MRI (if applicable) will be performed 
by [CONTACT_807416]' or affiliated Radi ology Department.  The Ultrasonographer at 
each Investigative Site will be required to acquire the ultrasound and MRI (if applicable) images according to the Imaging Acquisition Guidelines provided by [CONTACT_3120].  Images should be sent/transmitted to the ICL for subject evaluation during the course of the study.  Refer to the Image Acquisition Guidelines for instructions on submitting images to the ICL.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU), and/or SIS and MRI (if applicable) will be assessed 
both locally and by [CONTACT_3120].  If images are unevaluable, the ICL will inform the Investigative Site and additional images will  need to be resubmitted.  If there is a 
discrepancy between the local assessment and the central reader's assessment, this should be brought to [COMPANY_013]'s attention and [COMPANY_013] will discuss the findings with the local site and central reader on a case-by-case basis.  The Investigator or designee should consult the local ultrasound and SIS reports and/or images in order to make any safety-related judgments concerning the subject.  The interpretation of the local report and/or images will be filed or recorded in the subject's source documents.  Data and/or local interpretation from the local ultrasound and SIS images will not be recorded in the eCRF unless associated with a significant finding or adverse event.
During the Treatment and Post-Treatment Periods, the ICL may issue a report if any 
significant changes are observed that may affect subject safety during the study.  In these cases, the Investigator should review the local ultrasound and/or MRI images and treat as per standard of care.

All laboratory samples (hematology, chemistry, uri nalysis, endocrine panel, lipid panel) 
will be assessed using a certified central laboratory and these data will be used for data 
analysis.  The central laboratory will provi de instructions regarding the collection 
(including any fasting requirements), processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_26172].  Blood draws should be performed after vital signs and ECG recordings are conducted at a visit.  All
clinical laboratory samples will be shipped to the central laboratory, with the exception of the venous blood sample for alkaline hematin analysis which will be sent to the alkaline hematin laboratory.  Residual serum samples remaining after chemistry testing has been 
performed will be stored frozen at the central laboratory for possible repeat testing or further analysis upon [COMPANY_013]'s request.
The laboratory results (except Apo A and Apo B) will be provided by [CONTACT_807418], signed and dated by [CONTACT_737].  For any value outside of the reference range, the Investigator will indicate on the report if the result is clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS).  The Investigator will assess clinically significant laboratory values per standard of care which may include repeating the test to verify the out-of-range value.  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities may be documented as adverse events, depending on the interpretation of the Investigator (Section 6.1).
The Investigator will receive Sponsor defined alerts from the central laboratory.  The Investigator will review the lab alerts and assess clinical significance for potential events.
Blood samples for Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis will be 
collected and processed as indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (PD) and Section 5.3.2 (PK).
Safety Laboratory Tests
Clinical safety laboratory tests consist of hematology, clinical chemistry, including lipid 
panel and urinalysis samples.  The clinical chemistry and lipid panel samples should be 
obtained in the morning following an overnight fast (minimum of 8 hours); however, there may be circumstances when a sample was not under fasting conditions.  If a sample

Endocrine Panel
The endocrine panel consists of the following analytes:  FSH, LH, reflexive TSH and 
thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG).
Sanitary Product Collection for Alkaline Hematin Assay
Quantitative measurement of the volume of MBL will be performed using the alkaline 
hematin method.  Menstrual blood loss will be assessed in all subjects using validated 
sanitary products, also referred to as "validated" products.  Validated products have 
undergone analytical testing by [CONTACT_807419] (ABT-620)
M12-[ADDRESS_1114999] collection bags, 
bar-coded labels and a keg with screw-on lid for storage as provided by [CONTACT_55899].  It is important that only the sanitary products provided for use during the study are used.  Validated sanitary products may include:
●Tampax tampons (Regular, Super or Super-Plus absorbency)
●Stayfree Maxi Pads (Regular, Super Long or Overnight absorbency)
●Carefree Original Long Unscented pantiliners
Subjects will be required to collect and retain all sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting (subjects must be instructed to collect and return all used or 
worn products even if there is no visible blood on the products or if non-validated products were used) as described in the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory Manual.
The dispensation and collection requirements in the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods are outlined in Figure 4 .

Subjects who do not return a sanitary produ ct collection keg at a site visit (scheduled 
monthly visit, PCV or Unscheduled Visit) w ill be administered the UBQ by [CONTACT_112746].  
The Site Staff will ask the subject if she had any bleeding or spotting since the previous 
visit.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting since the previous visit, the site staff will ask why the subject did not return sanitary products.  Responses to these questions will be documented on the UBQ by [CONTACT_112746].
Sanitary Product Collection During the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period
Subjects will be required to collect sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or 
spotting up through and including their first menses with full menstrual flow in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  Once a subject has submitted sanitary products from her 
first full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period she will no longer be required to collect sanitary products during her subsequent menses.
Subjects who have not returned to their first full menses and have not returned a sanitary 
product collection keg in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period will be administered the UBQ by [CONTACT_112746].  The Site Staff will ask the subject if she had any bleeding or spotting since the previous visit.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting since the previous visit, the site staff will ask why the subject has not returned for a Post-Treatment Product Collection Visit to return her sanitary products.  Responses to these questions will be documented on the UBQ by [CONTACT_112746].  Once a subject returns sanitary products from a full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, the Post-Treatment UBQ no longer needs to be completed.
Return of Sanitary Products to Alkaline Hematin Vendor

prematurely discontinue during the Treatment Period are expected to enter the 12-Month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, unless discontinui ng due to pregnancy.  Each 
subsequent monthly Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period Visit s hould be scheduled based 
on the date of the last dose of study drug.
In the event that a subject withdraws or is prematurely discontinued during the Post-
Treatment Follow-Up Period, the subject should complete the Post-Treatment Premature Discontinuation Visit as soon as possible and undergo study procedures as outlined in Appendix C , Study Activities.  These procedures should not interfere with the initiation of 
any new treatments or therapeutic modalities the Investigator determines are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  The reason(s) for the discontinuation from the study will be recorded in the eCRFs.
All used and unused study drug containers will be returned to the study site.

M12-[ADDRESS_1115011] temporarily discontinue study drug 
administration, which will be referred to as "treatment interruption."  The following are examples for reasons when the [COMPANY_013] TA MD must be notified in order to assess whether a subject should undergo temporary treatment interruption:
●Adverse event, that based on clinical judgment, requires temporary suspension 
of treatment or prevents a subject from taking study drug
●Due to malfunction of barrier contraception or unprotected intercourse
Additionally, there may be times when a subject has had treatment interruption due to 
having forgotten to take study drug, lost study drug, etc.  If the subject has missed 7 or more consecutive days of dosing (with either ABT-620 or elagolix plus E2/NETA), the [COMPANY_013] TA MD must be consulted to determine whether the subject may resume study drug administration or continue in the Treatment Period.

personnel at the Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4, Month 5 and Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation Visits during the Treatment Period.  The study site personnel will document compliance in the IRT system.
The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will dispense study 
drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in  accordance with  the protocol.  The study 
drug must not be used for reasons other than those described in the protocol.
Subjects should be advised of the importance of treatment compliance.  Study drug should 
be taken consistently at approximately the same time in the morning and evening each day.  Daily recordings of study drug dosing will be obtained using a compliance 
packaging blister card for all subjects (for both elagolix and E2/NETA/matching placebo).  [COMPANY_013] will provide training and study drug compliance materials  to sites for instructing 
subjects on study drug compliance.

M12-[ADDRESS_1115022] access to the dosing compliance 
data; sites are expected to scan all returned blister cards (used/unused/unopened) to obtain the dosing information at each of the Treatment Pe riod Visits when st udy drug is returned 
to the site by [CONTACT_423].  Any unused/unopened blister cards should be documented as such in the scanning technology source documen tation.  Sites are expected to use the 
compliance data to guide them in discussi ons with the subject regarding compliance.  
Upon reviewing the dosing data, if the date(s) and time(s) for any of the last 4 doses of study drug (elagolix or E2/NETA or matching placebo) prior to the monthly Treatment 
Period Visit or Premature Discontinuation Vis it are missing, the subject will be asked to 
confirm whether doses were taken and to provide the dates and approximate times of the last [ADDRESS_1115023], if the number of tablets/capsules to be taken and the number of tablets/capsules returned do not add up to the number of tablets/capsules dispensed, an  explanation should be provided by [CONTACT_112787].
If a subject missed more than [ADDRESS_1115024] may continue.
Compliance packaging data will be used for exposure response analysis.

The IRT will maintain a current and accurate inventory of all clinical drug supplies, 
accountability, reconciliation, returns and destruction for each site.  The IRT will also include the lot number, kit number, Proof of Receipt number, the number of blister cards/cartons dispensed, initials of person who dispensed the drug, and the date study drug was dispensed for each subject.  In addition to using IRT inventory, an accurate inventory of study drug can also be kept by [CONTACT_779].
An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by [CONTACT_807422].  Throughout the study and upon completion or termination of the study, all used and unused containers 
will be returned to [COMPANY_013] according to instructions from [COMPANY_013].
The study Investigator or his/her designated representative agrees not to supply study drug 
to any persons not enrolled in the study or not named as a Sub-Investigator.
Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in Appendix C , Study 
Activities.  Returned study drug should not be re-dispensed to the subject.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This Phase 3 extension study will be conduc ted as a double-blind, multi-center, study in 
premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  This study will 
continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elagolix 300 mg BID alone and elagolix 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
97
300 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA QD (1 mg/0.5 mg).  The elagolix alone arm 
in this extension study is b eing used as a reference arm in order to better understand the 
effects of add-back therapy on safety and efficacy parameters.  This allows a benchmark for efficacy, as well as safety in regards to BMD and hypoestrogenic effects.  In addition, 
for a long term treatment, this  will allow a better understanding of elagolix alone, as well 
as activella.
5.6.[ADDRESS_1115026] Population
Premenopausal women with HMB (> 80 mL per menstrual cycle) and uterine fibroids 
were selected for this study because th at is the population who suffer from HMB 
associated with uterine fibro ids.  No studies in males or in females outside of the 
reproductive years are necessary for this proposed indication.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
This is an extension study to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], Studies M12-815 and M12-817, therefore 
the doses used in this extension study are the same as those used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_807405]-randomized to active treatment, either elagolix 300 mg BID alone or elagolix 300 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA QD in  a 1:1 ratio, therefore all subjects in this

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illn ess is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities, and vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An adverse event of amenorrhea will be reported for subjects who do not return to menses 
by [CONTACT_112747]-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Phone Visit and the adverse event will be followed until resolution.  The onset date of the adverse event will be the date of the Follow-Up Month 2 Visit.
A BMD decrease at any anatomic lo cation (spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], to tal hip or femoral neck) during the 
Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period that leads to discontinuation from study 
or a BMD decrease at any anatomic lo cation with a T-score < – 1.5 should be reported as 
an adverse event.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is b eing performed for a pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly  during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1

earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_1115029]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-[ADDRESS_1115030] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-
threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonga tion of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest
Some adverse events, such as adverse events of special interest (AESI), such as 
rash/hypersensitivity, fracture, neuro-p sychiatric (de pression, mood swings, etc.), 
vasomotor symptoms (hot flush, night sweats) or serious adverse events.  [COMPANY_013] may require additional information, including family  history, to be collected and recorded in 
the eCRF.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not re ported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_26183], an "Other" cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_112789].
6.1.[ADDRESS_1115031]-Treatment Follow-Up Period, (if applicable) will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].  In addition, serious adverse events and protocol-related nonserious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent.
If a subject prematurely discontinues from the study, i.e., either prematurely discontinues 
from Treatment Period and does not enter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period or prematurely discontinues from the Post-Tr eatment Follow-Up Period, adverse events and 
serious adverse events will be collected up to [ADDRESS_1115032] dose of study drug.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 5 .

pregnancy test.  If a serum pregnancy test result is positive at any time during the Treatment Period of the study, the site will immediately inform the subject to discontinue 
study drug.  Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected for any study subject with a positive serum pregnancy test from the signing of the informed consent through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  The site will report a positive pregnancy test to the Sponsor, will 
follow the course of the subject's pregnancy, and report to the Sponsor on the health of the subject and fetus at each trimester and at the first post-delivery pediatrician visit.
If the subject becomes pregnant during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Periods of the study, an ultrasound examinatio n will be performed as early as possible 
during the first trimester of pregnancy to assess the conception date and document an intrauterine pregnancy.  The following information on the outcome of the pregnancy that occurred after signing of the informed consent, regardless of when the subject became pregnant (i.e., either during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods) should 
be collected: fetal outcome (e.g., spontaneous or elective abortion, live infant or still birth), date of delivery, birth weight, birth length, gender, birth defects, congenital anomaly and medically significant complications during pregnancy or labor or delivery.  For live infant births, information on the health of the infant will be collected [ADDRESS_1115034] be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.

8.1.7 Efficacy
Data will be summarized separately for each of the treatment groups of subjects described 
in Section 8.1.1 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Variable
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Primary Analysis
The primary endpoint will be the percentage of subjects meeting a composite endpoint 
consisting of two bleeding assessments:
●Menstrual blood loss (MBL) volume < 80 mL during the Final Month (the last 
28 days of treatment in the Extension Study), and
●50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from baseline to the Final Month 
(the last 28 days of treatment in the Extension Study).
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-[ADDRESS_1115042] who prematurely discontinues the study drug due to adverse events, "lack of 
efficacy," or "requires surgery or invasive in tervention for treatment of uterine fibroids" 
will be considered as a non-responder regardless whether she meets the two aforementioned responder criteria or not.
The baseline MBL volume is described in Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_1115043] dose date in this Extension 
Study.
The MBL volume used for the primary and sens itivity analyses is defined as the total 
combined volume of blood ascertained via the AH method from all used (validated and 
non-validated) sanitary products that a subject returns.  In case a subject does not return any used sanitary products and indicates on the UBQ that she experienced bleeding during the Final Month, the MBL volume will be imputed per the procedure described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 .
The percentage of subjects with MBL volume < 80 mL at the Final Month and 50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from baseline to the Final Month in the Extension 
Study will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Derivation of Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The Final Month MBL volume will be derived as follows:
●If a subject has any evaluable AH data reported during the Final Month 
(i.e., she has at least [ADDRESS_1115044] 28 days of treatment), then her primary endpoint w ill be based on AH d ata during the Final Month.  
The subject's Final Month MBL volume will be the total MBL volume which is the sum of the observed MBL volu me over the last 28 days of treatment.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
112
●If a subject is missing the Final Month AH data and the Uterine Bleeding 
Questionnaire is completed, then:
○A value of 0 will be assigned to the Final Month MBL volume if no 
bleeding or spotting, "Subject only had spotting that did not require the use 
of sanitary products" or "There was no visible blood on the sanitary products" is indicated on the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire 
(Appendix D ).
●Otherwise, the primary endpoint will be imputed using multiple imputation as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 .
A flow-chart showing how the primary endpoint will be derived is presented in Figure 6 .

The imputation model will include but is not limited to the following variables:  baseline 
MBL volume, treatment group, and 28-day MBL volume at each post-baseline treatment cycle.  The final imputation model will be specified in the SAP.
First, M"semi-complete" datasets will be imputed to produce monotone missing data via 
MCMC using SAS PROC MI.  Then, M"complete" datasets for the Final Month MBL 
volume will be generated based on each "semi-complete" dataset via linear regression 
using SAS PROC MI.  Mrepresents the number of imputed datasets and its value will be 
specified in the SAP.
Each subject's responder status will be derived based on the imputed Final Month MBL 
volume from the Mimputed datasets.  The percentage of responders will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_1570].
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Variable
The sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will use different approaches for 
handling prematurely discontinued subjects and different approaches for dealing with missing Final Month MBL volume.  The details of the sensitivity analyses will be specified in the SAP.
Unless otherwise specified, the analysis dataset used for sensitivity analysis is the full 
analysis set.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) w ill be 
summarized for each treatment group.  TEAEs are defined as AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of the study drug and within [ADDRESS_1115048] will be counted in the severity/relationship category of "unknown," even if the subject has a second occurrence of the same event with a severity/relationship present.  The only exception is if the subject 
has a second occurrence of the same event with the most extreme severity (i.e., "severe") 
or a relationship category of "reasonable possib ility."  In this case, the subject will be 
counted under these most extreme severity/relationship categories.

Uterine Fibroids V2.0 (WPAI:UF) – SAMPLE
The following questions ask about the effect of uterine fibroid symptoms on your ability 
to work and perform regular activities.  Please fill in the blanks or circle a number, as indicated.
1. Are you currently employed (working for pay)? _____ NO ___ YES
If NO, check "NO" and skip to Question 6.
The next questions are about the past seven days , not including today.
2. During the past seven days, how ma ny hours did you miss from work because of 
problems associated with your uterine fibroid symptoms?  Include hours you 
missed on sick days, times you went in late, left early, etc., because of your uterine fibroid symptoms.  Do not include time you missed to participate in this study.
_____ HOURS
3. During the past seven days, how many hours did you miss from work because of 
any other reason, such as vacation, holidays, time off to participate in this study?_____HOURS
4. During the past seven days, how many hours did you actually work?
_____ HOURS  (If "0," skip to question 6.)
5. During the past seven days, how much did your uterine fibroid symptoms affect 
your productivity while you were working?  Think about days you were limited in the amount or kind of work you could do, 
days you accomplished less than you would like, or days you could not do your work as carefully as usual.  If uterine fibroid symptoms affected your work only a little, choose a low number.  Choose a high number if uterine fibroid symptoms affected your work a great deal.

your ability to do your regular daily activities, other than work at a job?  
By [CONTACT_43681], we mean the usual activities you do, such as work around the 
house, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], childcare, exercising, studying, etc.  Think about times you were limited in the amount or kind of activities you could do and times you accomplished less than you would like.  If uterine fibroid symptoms affected your activities only a little, choose a low number.  Choose a high number if uterine fibroid symptoms affected your activities a great deal.
Consider only how much uterine fibroid symptoms affected your ability to do your 
regular daily activities, other than work at a job.

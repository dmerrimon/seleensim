SHORT TITLE:  
 Page 4 of 13   2.0 Objectives  
 
Phase 1: to identify students and families interested in walking to/from school. Phase 2: to provide support to students and families interested in walking to/from school, and determine acceptability and appropriateness of the supports. 
 
3.0 Background  
 
Increasing rates of walking to school can lead to improvements in children’s overall 
physical activity and health. Yet, few children walk to school. Walking school bus programs, often included in Safe Routes to School efforts, provide children an opportunity to walk to school in a group accompanied by [CONTACT_107119]. This improves safety and support for walking to school. Our community partner, BikeWalkKC, provides walking school bus programming at some local schools in the Kansas City area. However, it is diffic ult to engage students and families to join these walking school buses 
and walk to school in general.   The purpose of this study is to test the acceptability and appropriateness of a novel behavioral coaching intervention for increasing the number of students who participate in a walking school bus or walk to school through other means. This study will be conducted at one local school, Banneker Elementary School in KCPS, where BikeWalkKC is providing a walking school bus in the fall of 2019. The walking school bus and BikeWalkKC’s involvement is not part of the research study. The research activities, which are being conducted by [CONTACT_850111], involve a cross- sectional 
survey of all students in the school (Phase 1), and a behavioral coaching intervention to up to 30 students, aimed to transition them from driving to school to walking (either with the walking school bus or through other means).     
4.0 Study Endpoints  
4.1 Completion of P hase 1, then Phase 2 if selected.  
4.2 No primary safety Endpoint. 
 
5.0 Study Intervent ion/Investigational Agent  
5.1 Description: behavioral intervention only. See below:  
Intervention  
In general, Phase 2 will involve a behavioral coaching intervention. This will include handouts, text messages via Redcap  and Outlook (see Jaylene Weigel’s  letter of support 
and the Texting Protocol in IRB submission), phone/skype calls, and email message communications with families (students and parent(s)) for delivering motivational content. The content will be theoretically based and cover skills building, goal setting, and problem solving. 
 
SHORT TITLE:  
 Page [ADDRESS_1181836] in walking to school through various means. They survey also asks for the student’s name, home address, parent email, and parent phone number. The survey is included in this IRB application. It was designed specifically for this study and some items were adapted from the National Safe Ro utes to School Center’s parent 
survey.   
Phase 2. At the end of the intervention, a survey will be administered to families (student 
and parent(s)) to assess their acceptability and preferences around the intervention content, and its appropriateness.     
6.3 Describe:  
• Source surveys , slides with scripts  (these will include 
PowerPoint slides that are turned into videos by [CONTACT_7087] a voiceover and accessible from a study website), parent handouts, and module protocols will be uploaded to myIRB. 
• Materials will be ac cessible here

Phase 2: up to 30 parent/child dyads 
13.2 N/A 
13.3 N/A  
14.0 Screening and Recruitment Methods  
14.1 Phase 1: The survey will be sent home with all students. Banneker 
staff will give the survey to each student to take home.  
Phase 2: We will purposefully select survey respondents based on 
their survey responses to reach out to via various means to offer t he 
intervention (Phase 2). If the desired enrollment numbers are not 
reached using this approach, recruitment fliers will be send home 
SHORT TITLE:  
 Page [ADDRESS_1181841] will receive the flier.  
We did not receive very many returned screeners. Thus, we are 
going to recruit more broadly as described above. We will screen 
those who respond to the recruitment flier to determine their 
eligibility. These eligibility questions were asked in the Phase 1 
screener survey, but need to use the Phase 2 phone script as a 
screener because we won’t have Phase [ADDRESS_1181842] group of students selected based on their survey responses. A Letter of Support from the school is included in this IRB application .  
14.4 No identifiers will be collected prior to p/a /c by [CONTACT_850113].  
14.[ADDRESS_1181843] subset of survey 
respondents up to three times  to offer the intervention, and share the 
flier with other families (including those who did not respond to the screener)  until up to [ADDRESS_1181844], 
a recruitment letter will be sent in the mail and email. Next, we will call the parent on the phone and go over the details of the study and screening (if interested) . At this time, the parent and child will either 
agree to participate or decline. The intervention will start the Sunday after enrollment.  
 
15.0 Reimbursement, Payment and Tangible Property provided to

25.0 Permission/Assent/Consent Process  
25.1 Indicate whether you will you be obtaining 
permission/assent/consent, and if so describe: 
• The study staff requests an alteration of the permission/assent 
process, more specially to use a verbal permission/assent.  They 
have reviewed the checklist for Waiver of Alteration of Consent process and have concluded that the study meets the criteria for number 1.  
• Since this survey collects minimally identifying 
information (name, address, phone number, and 
email) and the intervention is minimal ( behavioral 
coaching ) the study team is requesting an “opt out” 
permission/assent process where the participants indicate they do not wish to participate by [CONTACT_850114]. 
• The recruitment/enrollment phone call for Phase [ADDRESS_1181853] their relationship with the school or CMH. The script also covers the details/requirements of the study. This script has been uploaded with this amendment 
submission. 
 
SHORT TITLE:  
 Page 12 of 13   26.0 Process to Document Permission/Assent/Consent  
26.1 We will be requesting a waiver via 26.2 .  
26.2 This research  presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects 
and involves no procedures for which written documentation of 
permission/assent/consent is normally required outside of the 
research context . The IRB will generally waive the requirement to 
obtain written documentation of permission/assent/consent. 
26.3 The study will obtain verbal permission/assent/consent, but not document permission/assent/consent in writing, therefore a permission, assent and or consent script s (e.g., Study Information 
Sheet , in this case wrapped up in the study survey ) will be developed 
and uploaded  in myIRB in lieu of full permission/assent/consent 
forms .  
Review HRP -[ADDRESS_1181854] the research.  
• The survey will be sent home with students. 
• The intervention will occur over the telephone/skype, text, and email . 
• For research conducted outside of the organization and its 
affiliates describe:  
• A letter of support has been  obtained from the 
participating school.

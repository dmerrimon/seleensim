 Page 5 of 23  Revised: September 30, 2017  2.0 Objectives * 
Suicide and suicidal behavior are leading causes of adolescent mortality and morbidity. 
Suicide ideation is one of the strongest predictors  of imminent suicide or suicide attempt. 
Among common psychiatric disorders, depression has the strongest association with suicide ideation and attempt, but anxiety, substance abuse, and disruptive disorders also elevate risk. Therefore, to identify adolesc ents at high suicidal risk, it makes sense to 
screen for depression AND for suicidal ideation, regardless of diagnosis. There is some evidence, mostly in adults, that brief interventions can reduce risk for suicidal behavior, whether through improved conne ction with services, increased sense of connection and 
social support, or via systematic follow -up, and while some brief interventions aimed at 
safety planning have been advanced, there are no brief interventions for adolescents. Furthermore, insufficient resources are available to guide clinicians in suicide risk assessment and management. In fact, a review of the literature for suicide prevention apps shows that of 123 available smartphone apps, none are geared to providing guidance for clinicians treatin g adolescents. This lack of resources is especially problematic 
because as primary care clinics implement depression screening for adolescents and enhance collaborative mental health (MH) care as recommended by [CONTACT_32914] (USPSTF), more youth with depression AND those with 
acute suicide risk will be identified. Adolescents receiving treatment from an embedded MH provider may also result in the identification of even more adolescents with acute suicide risk. Enhancing me ntal health screening and providing embedded mental health 
treatment in primary care may have the unintended negative consequence of increasing emergency referrals and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which reflect the absence of current suicide risk management practices in primary care. Emergency department (ED) referrals for further 
evaluation are among those least favored by [CONTACT_32915]’ motivation to access and engage in follow -up treatment. Thus, there is 
urgent need to e quip primary care with the capacity to assess and stabilize depressed and 
suicidal adolescents, in order to avoid unnecessary ED referrals and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32872], to reduce suicidal behavior upon follow-up. 
We will develop an app- based intervention, BRITEPath that enhances the 
capacity of pediatric primary care to effectively manage depressed and suicidal 
adolescents by [CONTACT_32916]. BRITEPath includes three 
components delivered by [CONTACT_32917], including (1.) an electronic on-boarding procedure tool that supports MH clinicians, Guide2Brite; (2.) the adolescents’ safety planning app, BRITE; and (3.) the clinician dashboard, BRITEBoard, to facilitate treatment planning and communication with other primary care providers.  
 
2.2 The aims and hypotheses related to this specific protocol and submission are 
below for Phase 1b. Aims of the previous phase are in a University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32873] (#PRO18050281) entitled ETUDES Phase 1a-
qualitative. Aims of later phases described briefly will be submitted in subsequent 
protocols.

and Emergent Suicidality Phase 1b-Study 3- BRITEPath  
 
 Page 6 of 23  Revised: September 30, [ADDRESS_32165] the feasibility of using BRITEPath in community  & pediatric 
practices using a stepped wedge design. We hypothesize that participants, parents, 
and clinicians will find the intervention usable and feasible to deploy. We will assess the impact of BRITEPath alone (compared to its impact as part of iCHART in later phases of the ETUDES Center, by [CONTACT_32918]- up phone assessments 
on suicidality, depression, and functional sta tus at 4 and 12 weeks after intake.  
 
Aim 1b (Phase 1b, Feasibility). We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_32874] a stepped wedge design (50 adolescents aged 12 -26 yo). Hypothesis 1b: The use of 
BRITEPath will decrease depressive symptoms, distress, and suicidal ity (any self-
injurious ideation, urges, or behavior) as well as improve overall functioning compared to TAU.  
 
Criterion for success: 75% of adolescents who receive BRITEPath will use it, and 75% of MH clinicians will use Guide2BRITE and BRITEBoard.  
 
3.0 Back ground* 
Drs. Stepp (PI) and Brent (Co -PI) are have expertise with all aspects of the 
proposed study: developi[INVESTIGATOR_32875], partnering with private companies to create smartphone apps to monitor suicide and other high risk behaviors in daily life as well as analyzing the intensive longitudinal data resulting from such research protocols, conducting randomized controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for suicidal adolescents, and evaluating long- term outcomes from lon gitudinal studies of high risk adolescents 
and families with excellent retention.  
 In a previous study, [CONTACT_32939] and colleagues developed a brief, inpatient- based, novel intervention with an accompanying safety planning app (BRITE) for psychiatrically hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], suicidal adolescents. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_32876] 66 adolescents, this app -supported intervention cut the incidence of recurrent suicide 
attempts by [CONTACT_2016] (Incidence rate ration [IRR] for attempts=0.47, 95%CI 0.12-1.56, p=0.18), with a stronger effect in the 80% of adolescents with a previous history of a suicide attempt (IRR=0.23, 95% CI, 0.05-1.09). The app was accessed an average of 29 times over a 6 -month period, 45.5% accessed the safety plan, and 
the more frequently the app was used, the greater the decline in suicidal ideation and increase in reasons for living (rho=0.36, p’s=0.08). Participants rated BRITE high on usability using the Post- Study Satisfaction and Usability Questionnaire 
(lower score indicates greater satisfaction, range 10 -70, mean scores 17.6-18.4). 
Moreover, clinicians who implanted the interventions wanted the app to guide 
them in formulating the safety plan and populating the app for use by [CONTACT_32919]. These data provide preliminary support for the clinical utility of an app-supported intervention to reduce suicide risk in adolescents. An important next step is to further develop BRITE for use in pediatric care clinics by

4.0 Study Endpoints* 
At anytime , the primary investigators may discontinue a participant's participation 
in this study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_32877] a participant off this study if their health or safety may be at risk; if they have not been following study instructions or because of a study administrative decision by [CONTACT_978]. 
 
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
Overview of the BRITEPath intervention There are three components of the BRITEPath intervention, each of which will be described: 1) BRITE, 2) GUIDE2BRITE and 3) BRITEBoard.  All participants assigned to the intervention components will receive each of these [ADDRESS_32167], the app is customizable to uniquely meet the adolescents' needs and preferences.  Adolescents will be encouraged to use the skills on the app on a daily basis. Additionally, the BRITE app will include an electronic version of a safety plan that will be developed in collaboration with the youth's therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  Safety plans, which contain copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], social supports, and crisis contacts are used as a standar d of care in the treatment of suicidal youth.  
Finally, on each screen of the app, there is a link to crisis contacts that will be programmed onto the app with the assistance of their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  
 
GUIDE2BRITE  
Embedded mental health providers, who will treat youth who have access to the BRITE 
app, will use GUIDE2BRITE to facilitate the process of orienting youth to the app.  GUIDE2BRITE will be an interactive website that leads the clinician through the process of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a safety plan and identifying appropriate content for the BRITE app with their adolescent patient.  During this process, providers will orient patients on the purpose and function of the app, demonstrating and practicing skills they will use as part of the app-based intervention. Guide2BRITE supports clinicians in the delivery of an intervention designed to: (a) identify likely triggers of suicidal and self -harm urges; assess 
lethality and restricting access to means; (b) teach skills via modeling and role -
play to cope with suicidal and self-harm urges and (c) identify professional resources to access in a crisis should others means of copi[INVESTIGATOR_32878].  A mock -up that 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Center for Enhancing Treatment & Utilization for Depression 
and Emergent Suicidality Phase 1b-Study 3- BRITEPath  
 
 Page 8 of 23  Revised: September 30, [ADDRESS_32168] is a web -based portal that tracks participants use of the app, e.g. tracking 
distress ratings and times in which they added/removed content, as well as changes in patient outcomes over time, e.g. depression ratings collected as part of the study.  In order to facilitate effectiv e communication within the participant's clinical team, information on 
this portal will be shared among the adolescents' providers within their practice, including the embedded therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], their primary care provider, and other providers within the office that are designated as part of the adolescents' care team.  
 
6.0 Procedures Involved* 
We will develop an app- based intervention, BRITEPath that enhances the 
capacity of pediatric primary care to effectively manage depressed and  suicidal 
adolescents by [CONTACT_32916]. BRITEPath  includes three 
components delivered by [CONTACT_32917], (as described previously in this protocol) including (1.) an electronic on-boarding procedure to that supports MH clinicians, Guide2Brite; (2.) the adolescents’ safety planning app, BRITE; and (3.) the clinician dashboard, BRITEBoard, to facilitate treatment planning and communication with other primary care providers. Increasing pediatric primary care’s ability to effectively intervene with these mental health problems is likely to lead to reductions in 1) adolescent distress, 2) suicidal and self -harm urges, 
thoughts, and behaviors, depressive symptoms, and 3) improvements in functioning.  Although primary care practices following USPTF recommendations to integrate depression screening and embed MH clinicians into routine care will also inevitability increase detection of depressed and suicidal youth, no effective intervention for the pediatric primary care setting exists to treat and manage these mental health  problems. We propose to address this gap in 
services by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_32879] a novel app- based intervention, 
BRITEPath, optimized for delivery by [CONTACT_32920].  
BRITEPath wil l include several highly innovative features that are responsive to 
the needs of both the MH clinician and the adolescent, including (1) brevity of BRITE onboarding (30 minutes); (2) low provider training costs (4 hours); (3) immediate service delivery upo n initiation of treatment for depression or 
suicidality; and (4) provision of services in pediatric primary care clinics where the majority of adolescents are served. Furthermore, the Guide2BRITE component is innovative because, to our knowledge, it is the only safety planning 
app aimed at helpi[INVESTIGATOR_32880] -supported intervention. 
Guide2BRITE could serve as a paradigm for electronic guides for managing a wide array of mental health problems and emergencies.  
This study has the potential to improve treatment outcomes by [CONTACT_32921], monitoring symptoms and skills use, and facilitating shared decision making between clinicians and with 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Center for Enhancing Treatment & Utilization for Depression 
and Emergent Suicidality Phase 1b-Study 3- BRITEPath  
 
 Page 9 of 23  Revised: September 30, 2017  parents and patients. The simplicity and flexibil ity of BRITEPath would allow for 
its dissemination to reach beyond specialty MH clinics and is consistent with the 
NIMH 2015 Strategic Plan emphasizing the need for individualized strategies to improve patient outcomes. 
It is impractical for MH clinicians to offer BRITEPath only sometimes and to 
some patients and not others. Although a cluster randomized trial could address this issue, this design is not feasible for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Thus, we will utilize a stepped wedge design in which all practices start wi th Treatment As Usual (TAU) 
initially and are randomly chosen to transition to BRITEPath at different times. All clinics will be initially monitored for at least two months during TAU for the main outcomes of fidelity to delivery of the intervention. This will be followed by a staggered adoption of BRITEPath. At each time period, a new clinic will begin implementing the intervention. Block randomization determines the order each clinic begins BRITEPath. Each time period (approximately 3 months), a web-based  system will be used to assign the next clinic to begin using BRITEPath. 
We recognize the limitations of the proposed stepped wedge study design for evaluating the effectiveness of BRITEPath, once a practice enters their intervention phase, assignment to BRITEPath cannot be concealed. This concern is somewhat mitigated by [CONTACT_32922]-up assessors. Alternative study designs (e.g., randomized control trial) pose significant implementation challenges. Clinicians may be hesitant to deliver TAU once the BRITEPath intervention is known, which could lead to study condition contamination (e.g.,BRITEPath 
strategies introduced into TAU condition) and nonrandom patient assignment to 
condition (e.g., more high acuity patients referred to BRITEPath). In a stepped wedge design these feasibility concerns are addressed by [CONTACT_32923]. Additionally, these designs are consistent with our broader goal of enhancing participant and community stakeholder engagement with the ETUDES Center. Results from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_32881] y care. If our initial results show promise, 
these effect size estimates would be used to design a larger and adequately powered randomized control trial of BRITEPath.  
 
SCREENING Trained r esearch staff or site staff will determine appropriate potential participants 
to refer and either refer via email, phone, or in person when staff person is on site. 
Site staff will review medical record or be made aware of the potential 
participant’s chief complaint at presentation to the clinical setting to determine eligibility.  At the time of identifying an eligible participant, trained research staff will complete verbal eligibility screen (with parent if a minor participant is involved or with adult participant).  Upon eligibility , trained research site staff 
will enter participant contact [CONTACT_32924][INVESTIGATOR_32882] a firewall.  This will create an “ID” which

and Emergent Suicidality Phase 1b-Study 3- BRITEPath  
 
 Page 10 of 23  Revised: September 30, 2017  will communicate with the electronic Guide2Brite to create a profile for the 
participant in the secure BRITEPath web app. 
 STUDY INTERVENTION  
Following informed consent discussion in the site’s clinical setting, trained 
research clinical staff will implement BRITEPath  intervention (described above), 
help participant download app, and schedule a follow up visit with the participant.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]/ETUDES Center research staff will follow up with site clinicians or a designated primary care provider if safety issues emerge during the research phone calls following management of imminent safety/risk.   
PI[INVESTIGATOR_32883]/ETUDES  CENTER  RESEARCH PHONE CALLS  & EMR 
DATA  
During [ADDRESS_32169]  
include: sociodemographic questions, the CSSRS scale & suicide scales, quality of life ratings, treatment history, barriers to treatment, readiness for treatment, attitudes toward seeking psychological help, anxiety & mania adaptive scales via the K- CAT mental health adaptive screen, substance use, depression history, 
treatment preferences, and if there's a family history of bipolar disorder that impacts the youth's risk for mental health problems. A waiver of HIPAA authorization to collect permission verbally over the phone will be used to ac cess 
and collect medical record data. Electronic medical record information will be used to supplement treatment and service utilization and uptake of the BRITEPath 
intervention via the RE- AIM framework described in statistical analysis. Parents 
will respo nd to questions about their child, not themselves and youth will answer 
about themselves. Phone calls will take about 30- [ADDRESS_32170] the study intervention will 
be collected. This will include diagnostic records, referral information, dates, times, outcomes of patient appointments, notes pertaining to patient appointments, who in the EMR prescribed/referred patients to use the intervention, PHQ -9 
responses & scores, Service utilization (# visits- PCP, Mental Health specialty, 
ER, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]); pharmac otherapy; medical/psychiatric comorbidity; 
insurance coverage, matching referrals provided by [CONTACT_32925][INVESTIGATOR_1649], Use of technical  components of interventions & webportals, # of providers engaging in 
training/intervention, % representation at practice s ite, # practices who deliver 
intervention, and any other information needed for cost analysis purposes. 
As with the informed consent & assent, it is not practical for researchers to 
conduct any ETUDES research activities, including the HIPAA authorization for BRITEPath on site due to the time and work flow constraints that emerged from formative qualitative data collection prior to this trial. The providers identified the time constraint of about 5 minutes of patient interaction that would be allowed for 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Center for Enhancing Treatment & Utilization for Depression 
and Emergent Suicidality Phase 1b-Study 3- BRITEPath  
 
 Page 11 of 23  Revised: September 30, 2017  researchers to implement eligibility screening only. Thus the BRITEPath 
intervention, including informed consent and obtaining any necessary HIPAA 
authorization, was developed based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_32884] 1a focus groups & interviews to be implemented without impacting the clinical work flows.  
Further, the vast majority of participants recruited across sites  are not near the 
research offices in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] .  It would put undue burden on the research 
participants to complete in -person consent, baseline, & follow up assessment 
visits to ask them to come to instead of using verbal consent in their "real world" setting ( especially due to telehealth activities since the COVID -19 pandemic). 
A cost analysis is a core pi[INVESTIGATOR_32885], thus access to the electronic medical record is required. The intervention being tested as part of the study requires an understanding of the diagnosis, health service utilization, comorbidity, insurance coverage, medication usage, and any other information needed to conduct a cost analysis. The intervention results will include a cost analysis of the service utilization and outcomes of diseases and comorbidity. The results will require information on how many individuals used the intervention and the impact on their service utilization and disease.  
Note -full set of data collection measures will be provided upon request.  A data 
use agreement will be developed with site in the event that site investigators plan 
to collaborate on publications and will have access to de- identified data to 
conduct analyses.  Both the site and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32886]/patient re cords to recruit 
subjects.  
PROCEDURES FOR MANAGING SUICIDAL RISK AT Multi -SITE Location 
In the event that an adolescent is not able to commit to a safety plan or if the clinician feels concerned that the patient is at high imminent risk, the clinician will follow their standard care procedures.   Standard care involves careful 
assessment to identify the presen ce of imminent risk. If the clinician and their 
supporting clinical team determine the adolescent is in imminent risk, they will communicate the level of risk to the parent/guardian. Additionally, Drs. Brent, Goldstein, or Stepp will also be available as n eeded. Depending on the level of 
clinical severity, the MH clinician has the option to call the phone crisis network  
either for phone support or to request a mobile crisis team, or to refer the adolescent directly to a local psychiatric emergency to be ass essed for inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
 
7.0 Data and Specimen Banking* 
During the data cleaning period at the end and following conclusion of the study, the data will be thoroughly searched for any identifiers, so that data storage on a long- term basis, 
will be  stripped of identifiers.

 Data we are sharing includes responses from the Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (CASA) that is administered to both parent and child participants at baseline and all follow up visits. A limited data set of the CASA will be shared including all service utilization fields except names of facilities/providers. We also recode any date 
into “days since baseline.” The investigators will collect electronic health record data 
including:  1) Service Utilization: # Visits (PCP, MH specialty, ER, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]); pharmacotherapy; medical/psychiatric comorbidit y; Insurance coverage;

14.0 Withdraw al of Subjects* 
Youth and young adult participants and parents may be formally withdrawn by [CONTACT_978]'s if 
they develop a condition that meets criteria for exclusion or if they show evidence of clinical deterioration that may require further hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] d uring the course of study 
participation. Participants who are at risk for suicide attempts may need to be psychiatrically hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], and this may occur at any time during the course of the study. Participants will be referred to their primary care physi cian and further for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32889], psychosis, current intoxication, 
mania, rapid cycling, or mixed state. With permission, the study team may consult an

youth if it is the clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_32890]. Participants will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_32930]. In cases of severe adverse effects, patients may be instructed to go to the nearest emergency department. Adverse events will be reported to the IRB in accordance with current procedures.  
 Research participants may also choose to voluntarily withdraw and should provide written notice to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32891].  Data collected up until the point of receiving this noti ce will still be included in the research study.  Partic ipants may choose not to 
authorize HIPAA verbally for the researchers to collect medical record information and still participate in the remainder of study activities.  
 
15.0 Risks to Subjects* 
Protection a gainst risk will begin with careful clinical management and education 
of patients and families. Informed consent will be obtained at the enrollment phone visit and include specific details of all risks, including consequences of psychiatric illnesses.  
 
Baseline & Follow Up Assessments conducted by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_9109]/ETUDES Center 
The risks due to phone interview assessments and self -reported questionnaires 
are: 1) discussion of potentially upsetting information, 2) loss of confidentiality, and 3) assessment burden. The interviewers will all be trained and skilled interviewers who can assess and monitor the reaction to questioning about sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]; interviewees will be given the option of not responding or ending the interview. The assessment has been streamlin ed to limit assessment burden by 
[CONTACT_32931] a few measures per outcome domain. Each phone assessment should 
take about 30- [ADDRESS_32174] to involve communication between study staff and primary care physicians if there are indicators of clinical deterioration (e.g. suicidal thoughts 
emerge in youth interview and youth cannot contract for safety), to protect 
confidentiality. Every effort will be made to schedule assessments at times that are suitable for participants and families (after school or work) as needed in order to minimize negative impact on  other important work, school, or social activities.

BRITE Intervention:  
Risk management procedures involve referral if symptoms worsen or patients do not make significant gains and procedures to protect confidentiality are in place.  Parents will be advised to monitor their youth's phone/device to avoid their access of explicit or unwanted material, as  they typi[INVESTIGATOR_32893]'s personal use. Additionally, study PI & CO- I will be available to 
consult with clinical staff  about the intervention in cases where the intervention 
may not be providing any gain to the patien t or if symptoms worsen.  If a mental 
health staff identifies that their patient is at imminent risk for suicidal behavior, 
they will follow their usual standard of care in managing these symptoms.  The BRITEPath intervention will in no way interfere with the usual standard of care practices of managing imminent risk in pediatric primary care.   
The app is meant to measure distress, not suicidality, so there is no time in which 
it will trigger response from providers in real-time or outside of work hours.  The app will direct patients to deploy their safety plan if they are in crisis, which includes numbers for 24- hour crisis hotlines.  The contents of the participant’s 
safety plan will be available, even when the participant does not have access to wifi/data.  Some portions of the app, e.g. portions that link to websites or youtube videos, will not be available without internet connection.  Warnings are programmed within the app to notify participants when a poor connection is in place that may limit their a ccess to certain parts of the app.  
Minimizing Risk of Suicidal Behavior 
Since participants may be eligible who exhibit current suicidal ideation, the 
biggest risk for these participants is their risk for suicidal ideation, behavior, or even suicide.  In relation to assessment, there is now clear evidence that asking about suicidal ideation and behavior will not increase the risk for such behavior. Further, through repeated assessments of psychopathology, suicidal ideation, and behavior, we provide an additional safety net for the participants and their families beyond that which would occur in clinical care. As noted above, the research team will be appropriately trained in clinical management of adolescent suicidal ideation and behavior. Both the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32894] (AACAP) Practice Parameters on Suicidal Behavior. These include risk assessment, identification/modification of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_32895], and safety planning. Suicide risk will be managed within the primary care setting for youth in both the TAU and intervention group.  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Center for Enhancing Treatment & Utilization for Depression 
and Emergent Suicidality Phase 1b-Study 3- BRITEPath  
 
 Page 17 of 23  Revised: September 30, 2017  The ETUDES Center will generate “protocol alerts” for the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]/ETUDES 
clinical  assessors to assist with the detection and management of suicidality 
among adolescents. If suicidal ideation or behavior is endorsed at follow-up 
phone visits, trained clinical interviewers will engage in assessment of the adolescent's risk of attempt. A safety plan will be developed with youth expressing any suicidal ideation, if he or she does not already have one. The parent will be notified and the clinical interviewer will make a decision as to whether the patient is at imminent risk or not. Assuming that the patient can commit to a safety plan and the parent is agreeable, we already have obtained consent to notify the pediatrician and we will obtain permission to contact [CONTACT_32932][INVESTIGATOR_32896]. If the patient cannot commit to a safety plan and/or the clinical interviewer is concerned that the patient is at hig h imminent 
risk, this will be discussed with the parent, and the clinician will set up a conference call with a crisis hot line to further evaluate the patient.  If the patient 
refuses or hangs up, then the crisis team will be contact[CONTACT_32933]. Outside of Allegheny County/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] , PA, the crisis 
line is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which can  provide on-phone 
support, and can access emergency visits to the home based on local resources. If the assessor is uncer tain about assessment of suicidal risk, he or she will contact 
[CONTACT_32934]- call clinicians to either consult or speak directly with the 
patient and family. Similar procedures have been operative in studies of [CONTACT_32939]’s including the Familial Pathways study (R01 MH056612), which assessed 
youth with parental loading of depression and suicide attempt and the EDSTARS 
study (U01 MH104311), which assessed adolescent’s suicide risk within pediatric EDs. If the interviewer is uncertain about how to proceed, the PI, [CONTACT_32940] or Co-I, [CONTACT_32939], will be available as a back up. 
All aspects of the research interaction with participants will be private. Research 
staff will complete the phone assessments in a private, confidential location. In addition, research staff will ask the parent and youth prior to the start of the phone assessment if they are in a private location where they feel comfortable reporting sensitive information to the interviewer. Additionally all identifiable information will be held eithe r in a locked filing cabinet or in a secure online database with 
security and  confidentiality measures implemented and maintained by [CONTACT_32935][INVESTIGATOR_32897] . 
In the event that additional risks are found out, participants will be notified  
immediately of any risk it may pose to them. A copy of the verbal consent script will be provided to participants in the form they request (i.e. mailed, emailed). 
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects * 
This research project provides a n immediate app -guided inter vention to reduce suicidal 
distress.   
 Participants may also derive a sense of accomplishment from participation in research and contributing to the knowledge of screening, triage, and management of adolescent /young adult depression and suicidal ideation and behavior.

17.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality  
 
A stepped wedge design was selected for both ethical considerations and feasibility. A stepped- wedge 
cluster randomized trial design involves the sequential random rollout of an intervention over multip le 
time periods following a “baseline” period when no cluster has been exposed. The crossover is typi[INVESTIGATOR_32898], from control to intervention, and continues until all of the clusters receive the intervention 
with observations taken from every c luster and at each time period. All 3 studies in the ETUDES Center, 
and specifically, BRITEPath, will utilize this design. Prior to study start, each site  will be randomly assigned 
to switch from . 
 
Treatment As Usual (TAU) to the intervention. In the propo sed stepped wedge design, all practices start 
with TAU (i.e.,PCP referral to embedded MH care) and are randomized to transition to implement BRITEPath at different times. All clinics will be initially monitored for at least 2 months during TAU, 
followed by  a staggered adoption of BRITEPath. During each time period, a new clinic will begin to use 
BRITEPath (order determined by [CONTACT_17188]. A webbased system will randomly assign the next clinic to begin.  
 
With regard to the stated hypothesis: We will perform multilevel modeling to explore time - and 
intervention -level factors associated with BRITEPath’s use. We will first conduct t -tests for continuous 
variables and chi -square tests for categorical variables to examine baseline differences in demographic 
and clinical variables. We will use generalized linear mixed models (nesting for site) to examine between intervention differences in readiness. Distinguishing characteristics will be included as covariates in 
models examining treatment effects.  
Due to t he pi[INVESTIGATOR_31093], sample size and power considerations center around the precision of 
confidence interval (CI) width estimation for feasibility outcomes. In this development phase (Aim 1), a sample size of 50 affords us a 95% CI width of no more than 0.28.  
 
We will evaluate uptake of BRITEPath by [CONTACT_32936] -AIM framework and 
determine implementation outcomes as follows: Reach: Compare demographic and clinical characteristics 
of those patients who do versus do n ot (opt -out) get BRITEPath in practice for sample representativeness. 
Efficacy: Measure the percentage of patients for whom clinically significant reductions in depressive symptoms and suicidality as well marked improvements in functioning are obtained. Ad option: The 
percentage and characteristics of MH clinicians who participate in the BRITEPath study. Implementation: 
The percentage and characteristics of MH clinicians who follow through with BRITEPath use procedures 
(examining different components of app use). Maintenance: Extent BRITEPath is utilized and predictors of 
utilization after research support has been withdrawn.  
 
Identifiers that will be collected via electronic data management include:   name, email address, 
phone numbers, medical record numbers, and social security numbers for payment only.  We will 
be collecting location data (addresses), date information (Date of Birth, admission dates, etc), and sensitive data (such as protected health information, etc).   
 
The data will be collected on a web -based database.  Data will not be stored with participant 
identifiers and will be coded with a participant ID #.  Data may be stored on UPMC owned or University owned computers in research offices.  Documents containing data will be deidentified and encrypted with a password to which only the research staff have access.  The following

18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects*  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
The study is designed to carefully monitor patient and participant safety and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32904]. During weekly  project meetings, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_32905], neglect,  
suicidality, data entry, safety and maintenance of confidentiality for all active  participants, course of adverse events, 
and ongoing symptoms of suicidality. They  will review participant enrollment, instrum ent completion and data 
collection and  determine if any breaches of confidentiality have occurred, or if participants have  disclosed concerns 
that have warranted referral for further assessment or treatment,  or if participants have made any complaints related 
to the conduct of the study. The  PI [INVESTIGATOR_32906]. In the event of a breach of confidentiality, 
the principal inves tigator will inform the involved  participant and his/her parents that the breach occurred. The 
affected participant will  be assigned a new ID number. The staff involved will continue to be counseled by  [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_32907]. Any breaches of  confidentiality will be reported to 
the IRB by [CONTACT_458]. All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the WPIC Institutional 
Review Board according to the regulations set forth by [CONTACT_1201]. As defined by [CONTACT_1622], an SAE is  any adverse 
experiencing occurring during the study or within 30 days from termination of the patient/participant from the study 
that results in the following outcomes: death, a life- threatening experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32908], persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
or based upon appropriate medical  judgement, may jeopardize the participant's health and may require medical or  
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
 Data Safety Monitoring Board  
A DSMB committee will be formed to periodically (semi -annually) review data,  management of data and patient 
safety, reporting procedures and any UAPs and  SAEs that emerge from the research. All UAPs and SAEs will be 
documented and reported to the DSMB & Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32909], once a participant’ s immediate safety and welfare  are addressed.

 Page 21 of 23  Revised: September 30, 2017  During the informed consent discussion, the site staff will speak with the parent to 
obtain permission to enroll the teen in this study and consent for her or his own participation. The staff  will also speak with the adolescent to obtain her or his 
assent.  The assessor will ask the family to take the phone call in a private location to decrease confidentiality breach es and discomfort about talking about 
sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  
During the consent process, research /site staff will make it clear that participation 
is voluntary to both the parent and child participants or adult participant if they are 18 at the time of enrollme nt. If a minor turns 18 years old during the course of 
the study an additional consent process will occur via the phone to ensure ongoing willingness to participate  that Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]/ETUDES trained research staff will 
conduct. During each baseline and follow up phone call, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]/ETUDES trained research staff will ascertain if the parent and child are still interested in participating in the study questions prior to collecting or updating data. Both the site staff and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]/ETUDES trained research st aff will make the family 
aware that they do not have to immediately make the decision to consent and can take the time to think and discuss participation after they receive all the necessary consent and risk information. The staff may also say that their participation will not influence their care or relationship with care providers. The staff  will 
encourage the family to discuss their participation and provide several minutes for adequate reflection time.  
Staff from both Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32911]- sites are trai ned to ascertain if a participant 
is adequately understanding what is being said during the informed consent discussion and the research questions. S taff will describe the study in wording to 
reflect appropriate literacy level of a teen and parent. S taff w ill ask if the family

2/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION A4:
RATIONA LE
Protocol GO27834 has been amended to implement the following changes:  
Language has been updated to include18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (18F-FDG -PET; hereafter referred to as PET) /computed tomography 
(CT) scans as a response assessment. Lugano Response Criteria is base d upon 
PET/CT as a modality.  PET/CT is a correction to comply with the standard Lugano 
Response Criiteria (C heson 2014 ;Sections 2.1, 2.2.2, 2.3.1, 3.3.3., 3.3.4, [IP_ADDRESS], 
and 4.10.4, and Appendices C 1 and C 2).
Section 3.4.4 ( Risks Associated with ADCETRIS[Brentuximab Ve dotin ])has been 
deleted and other sections re -numbe red accordingly.  Brentuximab is a drug 
produced by [CONTACT_95695]. It's safety profile was used as a benchmark for 
potential safety issues, but is now no longer considered relevant with the body of 
experience available for pi[INVESTIGATOR_766112] (DCDT2980S) and polatuzumab 
(DCDS4501A) .
Language has been updated t o include second malignancies as an adverse event 
ofspecial interest in all studies containing obinutuzumab (Section 5.1.3) .
Language has been updated t o state second malignancies will be recorded 
indefinitely (even if the study has been closed) for all subjects enrolled in the 
obinutuzumab containing cohorts and irrespective of new anti -lymphoma treatments 
(Sections 5.2.1. and 5.6 and Appendices A 1, A2, and A 3).
The Medical Monitor has changed a nd the contact [CONTACT_766177] 
(Section 5.4.1).
Appendix A [ADDRESS_1050515] visits to occur at 3-month and 6 -month 
intervals as opposed to the erroneous footnote which notes "two -month" and 
"four-month" intervals .
Additional mino r changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.   
Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
The protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the protocol, where 
applicable.
SECTION 2.1:  PRIMA RY OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of this study are the following:
To assess the anti -tumor activity of the combination of DCDS4501A and 
obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and DLBCL 
based on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG -PET; 
hereafter referred to as PET)/computed tomography (CT) CR at the end of 
treatment according to Independent Review Committee (IRC) per Lugano 2014 
response criteria
SECTION 2.2.2:  Activity Objectives
The secondary activity objectives for obinutuzumab -containing arms of the study are the 
following:
CR at end of treatment based on PET /CTalone , as determined by [CONTACT_093]
Objective response (OR; CR or PR) at end of treatment based on PET /CT, alone as 
determined by [CONTACT_766178] 
OR (CR or PR) at end of treatment based on CT only, as determined by [CONTACT_766179]
Best objective response (BOR, CR or PR) while on study bas ed on PET /CTalone or 
CT only, as determined by [CONTACT_766180] 2.3.1:  Efficacy  Objectives
The exploratory efficacy objectives for this study are to evaluate the long -term outcome 
of obinutuzumab -treated patients according to Lugano 2014 response criteria, as 
measured by [CONTACT_716]:
Duration of response based on PET/CT PET and/or CT scans , as determined by [CONTACT_1275]
Progression- free survival (PFS) based on PET /CTand/or CT scans , as determined 
by [CONTACT_20603]
Event -free survival (EFS) based on PET /CTand/or CT scans , as determined by [CONTACT_766181]2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
4/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4SECTION 3.3.3:  Activity Outcome Measures
The following activity outcome measures will be assessed for obinutuzumab -containing 
cohorts (Cohorts E, G, an d H) according t o Lugano 2014 Response Criteria 
(Cheson etal. 2014 ):
The primary activity outcome measure will be assessed by: 
CR at end of treatment (6 [ADDRESS_1050516] dose of study 
medication) based o n PET /CTalone , as determined by [CONTACT_766182]:
OR (CR or PR) at end of treatment based on PET /CT, alone as determined by [CONTACT_766179] 
BOR (CR or PR) while on study based on PET /CTalone or CT only, as determined 
by [CONTACT_766183] 3.3.4:  Exploratory  Outcome Measures
The following exploratory efficacy outcome measures will be assessed:
DOR, defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR 
or PR to the date of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause, for the 
subgroup of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR, based on PET /CT
and/or CT scans as determined by [CONTACT_766184].  For patients 
achieving a response who have not experienced disease progression, relapse, or 
died prior to the time of the analysis, the DOR will be censored on the date of last 
disease assessment.
PFS, defined as the time from date of randomization or first treatment (for 
G-containing arms) to the first occurrence of progression or relapse, or death from 
any cause , based on PET /CTand/or CT scans as determined by [CONTACT_766185].
EFS, defined as the time from date of randomization or first treatment (for 
G-containing arms) to any treatment failure including disease progression relapse, 
initiation of new anti -lymphoma therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs 
first, based on PET /CTand/or CT scans as determined by [CONTACT_766186] 3.4.4:  Risks A ssociated with A DCETRIS®(Brentuximab Vedotin)
An ADC using the same MMAE drug and linker as that used in DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A, but coupled to an antibody targeting the CD30 antigen (brentuximab 
vedotin, ADCETRIS, Seattle Genetics), was recently approved by [CONTACT_766187].  
The most common adverse reactions observed in studies with brentuximab vedotin 
(occurring in at least 20% of patients) were neutropen ia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
fatigue, nausea, anemia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], diarrhea, pyrexia, rash, 
thrombocytopenia, cough, and vomiting.  
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
5/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Serious adverse reactions were reported in 31% of patients receiving ADCETRIS.  The 
most commo n occurring in 2% of patients included peripheral motor neuropathy, 
abdominal pain, septic shock, supraventricular arrhythmia, pain in extremity, and urinary 
tract infection.  In addition, John Cunningham (JC) virus infection resulting in progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death has been reported.  
Because of the use of the same MMAE drug, it is possible that the adverse events 
observed with the use of brentuximab vedotin can also be observed with the use of 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  
Refer to the current version of the ADCETRISPrescribing Information for full and 
updated details.
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Tumor Response A ssessments
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and re -assessed at each 
subsequent tumor evaluation.  Re sponse assessments will be assessed by [CONTACT_1275], on the basis of physical examinations, CT scans , PET /CTscans, and/or 
MRI scans, and bone marrow examinations, using standard response criteria for NHL 
(Cheson etal. 2007; Cheson et al. 2014 ) (see A ppendix C-1 and C -2).  Specific response 
assessment criteria differ between the rituximab -containing arms/cohorts and the 
obinutuzumab -containing cohorts (see Section 4.5.1.8a. and 4.5.1.8b).
a.Radiographic A ssessments for Patients on Rituximab -Containing
Arms/Cohorts
A PET /CTscan is required during screening for all patients with DLBCL.  An additional 
PET /CTscan in DLBCL patients with DLBCL should be obtained at the 6 -month tumor 
assessment to ensure consistency of response assessment methodology at this 
timepoint for all patients.  PET /CTscans should additionally be obtained to confirm 
disappearance of metabolically active disease during study treatment and to confirm a 
CR upon discontinuation of study treatment.  
For patients with FL, PET /CTscans ar e not required but may be obtained on the basis 
of physician preference and if permitted by [CONTACT_72952].  Similarly, for patients 
with DLBCL, PET /CTscans on patients with FL should be obtained during screening; 
for patients whose tumors are P ETpositive during screening, an additional PET /CT
scan should be obtained at the 6 -month tumor assessment.  PET /CTscans should 
additionally be obtained to confirm disappearance of metabolically active disease during 
study treatment and to confirm a CR up on discontinuation of study treatment. 
For all patients regardless of disease subtype, combined PET /CT-CTscans may be 
used instead of CT alone if performed with contrast and if collected with resolution 
sufficient to allow accurate and consistent compari son of target lesion measurements 
with subsequent PET /CT-CTscans.  If a PET /CT-CTscan is t o be used during 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
6/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4screening, then PET /CT-CTscans should be performed for all subsequent tumor 
assessments in order to ensure their consistency across different time points.
b.Radiographic A ssessments for Patients on Obinutuzumab -Containing 
Cohorts
PET /CTscans should minimally extend from skull -base to mid- thigh.  Full -body PET 
scan should be performed when clinically appropriate.
PET /CTand CT scans are required for patients with follicular NHL and DLBCL patients 
at screening, after Cycle 4 of study treatment (i.e., between Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 
Day1), and at EOT.  The EOT response assessment should be performed 6 8weeks 
after Cycle [ADDRESS_1050517] scans without PET scans will be 
obtained every 6 months for 2 years, with use of Lugano 2014 Response Criteria for 
NHL (see Appendix C-2).
d.Schedule of Tumor Response A ssessments for Rituximab- Containing 
Arms/Cohorts
Tumor response assessments will be performed every 3 months ( 1week) from the 
initiation of study treatment until study treatment completion or early termination 
(e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1050518] 
eight 21 -day cycles of treatment) .  The schedule of tumor assessments isindependent 
of the study treatment dose schedule.  For patients enrolled inrituximab- containing 
arms/cohorts, the schedule of tumor response assessments is detailed in Appendix A-1.  
As stated above, for all patient swithDLBCL enrolled ina rituximab- containing 
arm/cohort, PET /CTscans are required during the screening period and at the [ADDRESS_1050519] a combined PET /CTand CT scan at screening, after Cycle 4 of 
treatment, and at EOT.  The schedule for tumor response assessments for patients 
enrolled in obinutuzuma b-containing cohorts is detailed in Appendix A -3.
SECTION 4.10.4:  Activity Analyses
For patients in the rituximab -containing arms/cohorts with DLBCL, primary assessment 
of tumor response will be based on diagnostic imaging scans for example, CT and/or 
MRI scans and PET /CTscans. For patients with FL enrolled in the rituximab -containing 
arms/cohorts, primary assessment of response will be based on CT scans only; the 
assessment of response in patients with FL based on PET /CTscans will be performed 
for exploratory purposes only.

Study Design
Description of Study
This is a Phase Ib/II, multicenter, open -label study.  Up to approximately 246patients with 
relapsed or refractory follicular ly mphoma (FL)and DLBCL will be enrolled at approximately 
3040 investigative sites worldwide.  Additional patients may  be enrolled in order to obtain 
additional safety and/or efficacy data. Arms A and B and Cohort C are no longer enrolling 
patients.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
21/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4For Obinutuzumab Cohorts:
Only investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002] will enroll patients into Cohort E.  Investigati onal 
sites in the [LOCATION_002] and worldwide willparticipate in Cohorts G and H.
The study will be composed of a randomized portion and a non -randomized portion, as 
described in the protocol.
Rituximab -Containing Regimens with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A
Randomized Portion of the Study ( ArmsA andB)Closed to Enrollment
Following determination of eligibility, patients within each disease group will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments:
Arm A:  Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S (2.4 mg/kg) every 21 days;
Arm B:  Rituximab (3 75mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A (2.4 mg/kg) every [ADDRESS_1050529] to the following 
stratification factors:
For patients with FL(see the protocol for definitions)
Rituximab refractory disease (no response or disease relapse 6months from last 
rituximab treatment) versus rituximab relapsed disease (disease relapse after 
response 6months from last rituximab treatment)
For patients with DLBCL (see the protocol for definitions)
Second -line versus third -line (or beyond) therapy
For second -line patients, disease relapse or no objective response ( CR, unconfirmed 
CR [CRu], or PR )<12months from the start of initial therapy versus disease relapse, 
after initial objective resp onse (CR, Cru, or PR), 12months from start of initial 
therapy 
For third -line patients, failure to achieve a CR or progression < 6months from start of 
most recent therapy versus CR or progression ≥ 6months from start of most recent 
therapy
No formal testing comparing the two treatment arms in the randomized portion of the study is 
planned.
Non-Randomized Portion of the Study with Rituximab (Cohorts C and D)Closed to 
Enro llment
Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the non -randomized portion of 
the study will enroll patients into these cohorts.
Patients with relapsed or refractory  follicular NHL will be enrolled in Cohorts C and D to receive 
rituximab (375 mg/m2) combined with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg.  The 
first day of treatment constitutes Day 1 of each c ycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766116] 21 days in duration.
The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s discretion and only after the 
enrollment of patients with FL into the randomized portion of the study is completed.  Patients 
will not be randomized to receive one treatment or the other.  It is anticipated that Cohort C 
andD will be opened sequentially.  
All Patients on Rituximab -Containing A rms/Cohorts
All patients on rituximab -containing regimens, regardless of assigned arm/cohort, will receive 
DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion on a 
21-daycycle.  For the first two cycles, rituximab will be administered by [CONTACT_95077]1 
and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A will be administered by [CONTACT_95077]2.  In the absence 
of any infusion -related adverse events, rituximab and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may  be 
administered on the same day ( Day1) in subsequent cy cles beginning with the third cycle.  In 
this instance, rituximab will be administered first, followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S or DCDS4501A.  In 
certain c ircumstances for example , infusion -related reactions ( IRRs) requiring interruption or 
slowing of infusion raterituximab may  be administered over 2 days (e.g., Day1 and Day2 of 
the cycle); in this case, DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be administered on Day2following 
completion of the rituximab infusion or on Day3 of the cy cle.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
22/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Patients may receive treatments for up to 1 year (17 cycles on an ever y-21-day schedule) if not 
discontinued because of significant toxicity, disease progression, or withdrawal from study.
Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the Schedules of Assessments 
outlined in the protocol.  Initial response assessments in this study will be performed ever y 
3months from the initiation of therapy until study treatment completion or early termination 
(e.g., between Day s14 and [ADDRESS_1050530] 
eight 21-day cycles of treatment).  Additional response assessments for patients who proceed 
to crossover treatment will be performed as described in the protocol ; response assessments 
for patients who discontinue study treatment (both initially assigned treatment and crossover 
treatment) for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as described in the 
protocol.
Responses to study  treatment will be based on investigator assessments.  In addition, tumor 
assessment data will be transmitted to an Independent Review Facility (IRF) for collection and 
possible independent review.
Obinutuzumab- Containing Regimens with DCDS4501A  (Coho rts E, G, and H)Closed to 
Enrollment
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg will be given in combination with obinutuzumab to patients with 
relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and DLBCL in two stages: (1) safety run -in and 
(2) expansion .
Study treatment will be given in [ADDRESS_1050531] cycle, obinutuzumab will be administered by 
[CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, and 15.  DCDS4501A will be given on Day 2 for Cycle 1.  In the
absence of any infusion -related adverse events, obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A may be 
administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent cy cles beginning with the second c ycle.  
Ifobinutuzumab and DCDS4501A are administered on the same day, the study drugs w ill be 
given sequentially.  Obinutuzumab will be administered first, followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A.  In 
certain circumstances for example, IRRs requiring interruption or slowing of infusion 
rateobinutuzumab may  be administered over 2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 o f the cycle); 
inthis case, DCDS4501A may be administered on Day 2 following completion of the 
obinutuzumab infusion.
Obinutuzumab- Containing Regimen in Phase Ib: Safety Run -In (Cohort E)
This portion of the study will consist of a safety run -in that will evaluate the safety of 
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in 6 patients (Cohort E).  The 
safety run -in is described in detail in the protocol.  
Obinutuzumab
-Containing Regimens in Phase II:  Expansion Stage (Cohorts G and H)
After the safety  run-in has demonstrated that DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with 
obinutuzumab is safe to administer, patients will be enrolled into two expansion cohorts based 
on histology of follicular NHL or DLBCL (Cohorts G and H respectively).  Forty pa tients will be 
enrolled into each expansion cohort.  A n additional cohort(s) may  be added in the future.

DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
24/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Crossover Treatment (Randomized Patients in A rms A  and B Only)
Patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B who develop progressive disease may be eligible to 
receive crossover treatment consisting of rituximab and the other antibody -drug conjugate 
(ADC) or the other ADC alone for example, Arm B treatment for patients who have disease 
progression while receiving Arm A treatment, and vice versa provided the following conditions 
are met:
Patients must not have experienced a toxicity requi ring the discontinuation of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment OR experienced toxicity during the last dose of study 
treatment that would preclude treatment with the crossover regimen.
Patients who had modifications to dosing and/or schedule on the initial stud y treatment 
will be permitted to receive crossover treatment in the absence of toxicities on the 
modified dose and/or schedule.  The dose and schedule of crossover treatment will be 
determined by [CONTACT_33495].
Patients who had rituximab discontinued and continued on single -agent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment may receive crossover treatment of single -agent 
DCDS4501A/ DCDT2980S.
Patients must have radiographically documented disease progression.
Patients must me et all inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the Inclusion Criteria 
and Exclusion Criteria sections below, except for those related to prior rituximab treatment.
Acceptable toxicity:  All study drug –related adverse events from the initial study treatment 
must have decreased to Grade [ADDRESS_1050535] day of treatment 
on the crossover regimen.  Exceptions may  be allowed after a careful assessment and 
discussion of the benefit -risk balance with the patient by [CONTACT_766195].
Administration of crossover treatment must be in the best interests of the patient as 
determined after a careful assessment and discussion of benefit -risk balance with the 
patient by [CONTACT_766196].
A tum or biops y (described in the protocol) will be required for patients with safely accessible 
site of disease, defined as requiring only local anesthesia and, in general, excluding the 
brain, lungs or any internal organs that may subject patients to significant risk. 
Patients for whom a safely accessible site of disease is not present may still receive 
crossover treatment without undergoing a biopsy.  Eligibility to receive crossover 
treatment should be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_27217].
A tum or biops y of a safely accessible site of disease is optional for patients who are 
not eligible for study cross over. 
Patients who are determined to be eligible for study cross over will be treated as follows:
Assessments obtained at the initial study  treatment discontinuation visit (described in the 
protocol) may be used as screening assessments for crossover treatment.  The following 
re-screening assessments must be repeated/obtained within 1 week prior to starting 
treatment on the crossover re gimen, in order to re -establish baseline pretreatment clinical 
and disease status:  targeted physical exam, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
status, and hematology and serum chemistry  laboratory tests.
Re-screening tests for hepatitis B and C do n ot need to be performed unless there is 
clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_136701] B and/or C positivity.
A radiographic tumor assessment must also be performed, unless already done to 
document disease progression, within 6 weeks prior to starting crossover treatment.
Crossover treatment will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1050536] dose of the prior study 
treatment.
Patients will be treated with the crossover treatment until a second disease progression event 
relative to the tumor assessment, documenting progressi ve disease on the initial study 
treatment, clinical deterioration, and/or intolerance to the crossover treatment for up to a 
maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an ever y-21-day schedule).  Patients will be evaluated for 
safety and efficacy  according to the sch edules of assessments outlined in the protocol.  
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
25/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than 
disease progression will be performed as described in the protocol .

study or the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034], whichever occurs first.  The analyses will be 
based on the safety evaluable population, defined as patients who received at least one dose of 
study treatme nt.  All summaries will be presented according to the disease -specific cohort, 
treatment group, and assigned dose level.
Analysis of the Conduct of the Study
Enrollment, major protocol violations, and reasons for discontinuations from the study will be 
summarized.
Demographic and baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, weight, duration of 
malignanc y, and baseline ECOG Performance Status, will be summarized using means, 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
30/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4standard deviations, medians, and ranges for continuous variables and proportions for 
categorical variables.  All summaries will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_1570], assigned 
dose level, and disease- specific cohort.
Study drug administration data will be listed by [CONTACT_90050] -specific cohorts described in the 
protoc ol.  Any dose modifications will be flagged.  Means and standard deviations will be used 
to summarize the total doses of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A ,rituximab, and obinutuzumab
received.  All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], assigned dose level, a nd 
disease -specific cohort.
Safety A nalysis
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory test 
results, changes in physical findings on phy sical examinations, and changes in vital signs.  All 
patients who receive any am ount of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A ,rituximab, or obinutuzumab will 
be included in the safety analy sis and will be assigned to the treatment group on the basis of 
the study treatment received.  Patients who have dose level changes from the initial assigned 
dose level will be summarized by [CONTACT_766204]2980S or DCDS4501A.
All adverse event data will be listed by [CONTACT_3885], patient number, treatment group, 
disease -specific cohort, and cycle.  All adverse events occurring on or after treat ment on Day 1 
of Cycle1 will be summarized by [CONTACT_570618], appropriate thesaurus levels, and 
NCICTCAE v4.0 toxicity grade.  In addition, all serious adverse events, including deaths will be 
listed separately and summarized.  
Selected laboratory data wi ll be listed, with values outside of normal ranges identified.  The 
incidence of antibodies to DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A will be summarized.
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic A nalyses
Individual and mean serum concentrations of total DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A antibody 
(conjugated and unconjugated antibody) and rituximab or obinutuzumab and plasma 
concentrations of acMMAE and free MMAE versus time data will be tabulated and plotted by 
[CONTACT_766205] (relapsed or refractory follicular NHL or DLBCL).  The ph arma cokinetics 
of the above analytes will be summarized by [CONTACT_570674] 
(e.g., AUC, C max, CL, V ss,and t 1/2).  Estimates for these parameters will be tabulated and 
summarized (mean, standard deviation, and range).  Non -compartme ntal, compartmental, 
and/or population methods will be used, as data allow. 
Exposure -response (safety and efficacy ) analysis may  be conducted with use of PK data and 
available drug effect (e.g., imaging, measures of tumor burden) and toxicity (e.g., clinical 
pathology) data, at the sponsor’s discretion.
In addition, population PK methods may  be employed to manage sparse data and to investigate 
the effects of certain covariates on the pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, as 
data allow, and at the sp onsor’s discretion.
Activity A nalyses
Best overall response, duration of response, and PFS will be listed for all patients.
Overall response rate (ORR) from the initial study treatment will be calculated on the basis of 
data from patients who received stud y treatm ent.  Objective response is defined as CR or PR 
as determined by [CONTACT_093], on the basis of physical examinations, radiographic scans, 
and bone marrow examinations, using modified response criteria for NHL and confirmed by 
[CONTACT_294862] 4weeks after initial documentation.  Any patient with insufficient data to 
determine response will be classified as a non -responder.
For patie ntsin the rituximab -containing arms/cohorts with DLBCL, primary  assessment of 
tumor response will be based on diagnostic imaging scans for example, CT and/or MRI scans 
and PET /CTscans. For patients with FL enrolled in the rituximab -containing arms/cohorts, 
primary  assessment of response will be b ased on CT scans only; the assessment of response 
in patients with FL based on PET /CTscans will be performed for exploratory purposes only.
For patients on obinutuzumab -containing cohorts, primary response assessment for both 
DLBCL and FL will be based on PET/CT scans using the updated 2014 Lugano Response 
Criteria. Patients in Cohorts E, G, a nd H will be evaluated with a PET /CT scan at screening, 
between C ycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1 , and at the end of treatment ( 6-8 weeks after 
completing treatment).   The efficacy  analysis for these cohorts will, therefore, be differe nt from 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
31/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4the analysis for Arms A B and Cohorts C D.  Subsequent imaging can be CT only.  Responses 
to study treatment will also be based on investigator assessments.
Among patients with an objective response, duration of response will be defined as the time 
from the initial documentation of a CR or PR to the time of disease progression or death.  If a 
patient does not experience death or disease progression before the end of the study, dura tion 
of response will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment.
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), PFS is defined as the time from the 
date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichev er 
occurs first.  If a patient has not experienced progressive disease or death, PFS will be 
censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.  Patients with no post -baseline tumor 
assessment will be censored on the date of randomization.  For the non -randomized portion of 
the study (Cohorts C through H), PFS is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to 
the date of disease progression or death from any  cause, whichever occurs first.
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), OS is defined as the time from the date 
of randomization to the date of death from any  cause.  For the non -randomized portion of the 
study (Cohorts C through H), OS is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to date 
of death from any cause.
Exploratory A nalyses
Assay results of possible predictive markers will be listed by [CONTACT_766206].
Frequencies and percentages of missing data for the PRO endpoints will be reported.  Dropouts 
(defined as patients withdrawing from treatment for reasons other than documented disease 
progression or death) will be summarized.
Summary  statistics of the MDASI items, scales, and their changes from baseline will be 
calculated at each assessment timepoint.  The mean, standard error, and median of the 
absolute scores and the mean changes from baseline (and 95% CI) within and between study 
arms will be reported for the MDASI scales and single items, as well as the weekly averages of 
the worst sy mptom rating.  For change scores in the MDASI from basel ine, patients without 
baseline scores will not be included in the analyses.  Line charts depi[INVESTIGATOR_766118].  
Repeated measures mixed -effects models will explore MDASI subscale scores with a b aseline 
score and appropriate covariates added, as appropriate.
Handling of Missing Data
For the endpoint of objective response, patients without a post -baseline tumor assessment will 
be considered non -responders in the all -treated population analy sis. 
For duration of response and PFS, data from patients who are lost to follow -up will be included 
in the analysis as censored observations on the last date that the patient is known to be 
progression free, defined as the date of the last tumor assessment, or , if no tumor assessments 
were performed, as the date of last study treatment plus 1 day.
Compliance to PRO data collection will be reported with summary  statistics, including 
frequencies of reasons for non -compliance such as patient refusal to complete PR O data 
collection.  
Determination of Sample Size
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), a target of 120 patients will be enrolled 
in two separate cohorts of patients (40 inthe follicular NHL cohort and 80 in the DLBCL cohort).  
The rando mized portion of this study is non -comparative in nature.  No formal hypothesis 
testing is planned to compare the treatment arms.  Moreover, there is insufficient power to 
detect minimum clinically meaningful differences between the two treatment arms.  Genentech 
has judged the proposed sample size to provide sufficient precision in estimating the anti -tumor 
activity of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab or DCDS4501A combined with rituximab as 
measured by [CONTACT_33966].  For example, with the assumption of an observed response 
rate of 40%, a 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be approximately 22% 58% 
(i.e., 40%  18%) for the follicular NHL cohort and approximately 27% 53% (i.e., 40% 13%) 
for the DLBCL cohort.  W ith 40 patients, there is an 87% chance of observing at least one 
adverse event with a true incidence of 5%.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
32/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4For the non -randomized portions of the study (Cohorts C and D), approximately 20 patients will 
be enrolled into each arm, for a total of 40 patients.   W ith 20 patients u nder an observed 
response rate of 40%, the exact Clopper -Pearson 90% confidence interval for the response rate 
would be 22% 61%.  With respect to the assessment of safety based upon a sample size of 
20patients, the chance of observing at least one adverse event with a true incidence of 10% is 
88%.
For the obinutuzumab safety run- in cohort (Cohort E), 6 patients will be enrolled.  For the 
obinutuzumab expansion cohorts (Cohorts G and H), 40 patients with follicular NHL and 
40patients with DLBCL will be enr olled at the RP2D to further evaluate safety and efficacy  of 
the combination.  Table 3 in the protocol provides asymptotic 90% confidence intervals for the 
true probability of response for a range of observed proportions based upon a sample of 
40patients.   A sample size of 40 patients is deemed sufficient to provide adequate precision on 
the point estimate and for the lower end of the 90% CI to rule out a clinically uninteresting rate 
of 45% assuming observed response rates of approximately 60% or higher ( ~24 responders 
observed among 40 patients).
Therefore, up to 252 patients may be enrolled in this study.

1.1 BACKGROUND ON DISEA SE 
B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders are a heterogeneous group of malignancies, ranging 
from slow -growing indolent and incurable diseases with a median survival of 810years 
(such as follicular non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL]) to more aggressive intermediate -to 
high-grade lymphomas (such as diffuse large -cell lymphoma), which can have a median 
survival of 6 months if left untreated or long -term remission in more than 50% of patients 
with appropriate treatment.  Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common 
type of NHL accounting for approximately 30% 40% of all new patients, whereas 
follicular lymphoma (FL) accounts for approximately 20% 25% of new lymphomas.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_766119]20 -specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) rituximab (Rituxan®,MabThera®) in 
combination with chemotherapy, indolent B -cell malignancies remain incurable ,as do 
approximately half of aggressive NHL patients.  Thus, there is still a need for treatments 
that can be combined with chemoimmunotherapy and can significantly extend 
disease- free and overall survival (OS) in these patients, with at least acceptable, if not 
superior, safety profiles.
1.2 BACKGROUND ON THE MO LECULES
1.2.1 DCDT2980S
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Preclinical Data
CD22 is a cell -surface antigen whose expression is restricted to all mature Bcells except 
plasma cells.  It is expressed in a majority of the B cellderived malignancies, including 
nearly all NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (C LL) samples tested (see Figure 1).  
Antibodies bound to CD22 are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570580], making CD22 i deally suited for 
targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents ( Shan and Press 1995 ).  
DCDT2980S is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of a potent anti -mitotic 
agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugated to a humanized im munoglobulin -G1 
(IgG1) anti -CD22 MAb, MCDT2219A, via a protease -labile linker, 
maleimidocaproyl -valine -citrulline -p-aminobenzoyloxycarbonyl (MC- VC-PABC).  
MMAE has a mode of action similar to vincristine, which is a component of standard 
chemotherapy used in lymphoma therapy.  This therapeutic approach takes advantage 
of the specific targeting capability of the antibody and the cytotoxic activity of MMAE.
Following internalization, the MMAE is deconjugated from DCDT2980S by [CONTACT_766207], binds to tubulin ,and disrupts the microtubule network, resulting in inhibition of 
cell division and cell growth and induction of apoptosis ( Doronina etal. 2003 ).

MCL (n20), and MZL (n 60). 
Comprehensive pharmacolog ic, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and 
toxicology evaluations were conducted to support the use of DCDT2980S in clinical 
trials. DCDT2980S binds human CD22 with a high affinity (equilibrium dissociation 
constant [K d]1.70.2nM) and showed similar binding affinity to cynomolgus monkey 
CD22.  No bindi ng activity was observed with mouse and rat peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  
The unconjugated antibody MCDT2219A did not appear to induce antibody -dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in vitro.  
Incontrast, DCDT2980S displayed potent and selective inhibition of cell proliferation in 
vitro ( 50% of the maximal inhibitory concentration [IC 50]0.33 nM) by [CONTACT_766209].  Efficacy studies conducted in murine xenograft models of human lymphoma 
(CD22 -positive W SU-DLCL2 and BJAB cell lines) showed that a single dose of 
DCDT2980S resulted in regression of tumor growth at doses ranging from 1 to 4 mg/kg.  
PD studies with DCDT2980S showed that a single dose of 1 6mg/kg resulted in partial 
depletion o f peripheral blood B cell s in cynomolgus monkeys with a corresponding 
depletion in germinal center B cell s in lymphoid tissue.0100020003000

39/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4The PK profiles of DCDT2980S were observed to be linear in rodents and moderately 
non-linear in cynomolgus monkeys over the tested dose range.  The non -linear 
clearance (CL) observed in cynomolgus monkeys with DCDT2980S is likely due to the 
contribution of B cell -mediated CL to the total CL.  The free MMAE concentrations in 
cynomolgus monkeys following DCDT2980S administration were generally [ADDRESS_1050548] relevant nonclinical species for the 
toxicology and PK/PD studies of DCDT2980S, given the comparable sequence 
homology of human and cynomolgus monkey CD22, similar binding affinity of 
DCDT2980S to human and cynomolgus monkey CD22, and comparable tissue 
cross- reactivity in both human and cynomolgus monkey tissues.   DCDT2980S was well 
tolerated at doses of up to 3 mg/kg (highest non-severely t oxic dose [HNSTD]) in 
monkeys and up to or greater than 10 mg/kg in rats (severely toxic dose to 10% [STD 10] 
of rats10mg/kg).  Reversible bone marrow toxicity and associated hematopoietic 
changes were observed in both rats and monkeys treated with DCDT 2980S or MMAE, 
suggesting that the toxicity of DCDT2980S is related to MMAE.  Additional effects on 
liver and lung in rats were minimal in sever ity and reversible and did not occur in 
cynomolgus monkeys, which may be due to differences in species sensitivi ty, exposure, 
and/or pharmacokinetics .

Investigator’s Brochure.
[IP_ADDRESS] DCDT2980S Clinical Data
a.Patient Enrollment
Both DCDT2980S monotherapy and combination therapy with rituximab have been 
studied in a Phase I study ( Study DCT4862g) of patients with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell malignancies expected to express CD22, including indolent NHL, DLBCL, mantle 
cell lymphoma (MCL), and CLL.
All data presented herein is based on a data entry cutoff of 22 February 2013, with 
clinical data available from 65 patients with NHL (excluding patients with CLL) enrolled in 
dose- escalation and expansion cohorts.  These include 49 patients who were treated 
with single -agent DCDT2980S at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg administered 
intravenously every 21 days and 16 patients who were enrolled into two Phase Ib 
cohorts with DCDT2980S administered at doses of 1.8 mg/kg (5 patients) and 2.4 mg/kg 
(11patients) in combination with 375 mg/m2rituximab.
Enrollment into CLL dose escalation cohorts was closed on 31 May 2013.  Refer to the 
DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure for details regarding clinical data in CLL patients.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
40/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4b.Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S have been character ized in the Phase I 
Study DCT4862g.  DCDT2980S was administered to patients with NHL at dose levels 
ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg every 3weeks (Q3W ).  Three analytes were quantified:
antibody -conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), total antibody, and free MMAE. 
Preliminary PK analysis based on available data as of 22 June 2012 is summarized 
below.  
The mean value of CL estimates of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level for 
doses of ≥1.0mg/kg ranged from 17.6 to 21.3 mL/day/kg and from 10.5 to 
16.2 mL/day/kg, respectively.  Similar CL estimates for doses 1.0mg/kg suggested 
dose- proportional increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposure.  CL estimates 
appeared to be slightly higher at doses 1.0mg/kg (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg), although 
data from these d ose levels are limited.  The CL of acMMAE was faster than that of total 
antibody at each dose level.  
In patients with NHL, the mean value of the steady -state volume of distribution (V ss) of 
acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level ranged from 69.2 to130mL/kg and from 
97.4 to 154 mL/kg, respectively, across the dose levels tested, approximating human 
serum volume.  V ssvalues did not appear to change substantially with dose.  The half -life 
for acMMAE and total antibody ranged from 2.9 to 7.0 days and from 4.4 to 13 days, 
respectively.  
For acMMAE and total antibody, the time to maximum concentration occurred 
immediately after infusion.  For free MMAE, the time to maximum concentration was 
approximately 2 to 3days after infusion. Maximum plasma and serum concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the concentration -time curve from Time 0 to infinity ( AUC inf) of free 
MMAE appeared to increase with dose across the dose levels tested.  A half -life of 
3-4days for free MMAE was observed, which is relatively long and similar to that of its 
parent conjugate, suggesting formation ratelimited kinetics of free MMAE.  No 
accumulation of free MMAE is expected for the Q3 Wregimen.  The C maxvalues of free 
MMAE in NHL patients were at least [ADDRESS_1050549] elimination once it is formed. 
Preliminary comparisons of pharmacokinetics between patients with NHL and CLL (for 
which patients are enrolled into sepa rate dose -escalation cohorts) treated with identical 
doses of DCDT2980S provide some insight into the factors that affect pharmacokinetics .  
Both acMMAE and total antibody were cleared faster in CLL patients than in NHL 
patients.  This observation is likel y to be related to the high number of circulating Bcells 
generally observed in CLL patients, which may result in significant target -mediat ed CLof 
DCDT2980S.  The free MMAE exposure in CLL patients was relatively low compared to 
that of its parent conjuga te.  
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
41/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4The exposure parameters (C maxand AUC inf) of total antibody, acMMAE ,and free MMAE 
were similar between DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S + rituximab at doses of 1.8 and 
2.4mg/kg, based on preliminary data.  This observation suggests that when given in 
combin ation, rituximab does not impact the pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S; the effect 
of DCDT2980S on rituximab pharmacokinetics will be assessed.
All observations will be verified with additional data from the ongoing Phase I study as 
well as this study.

c.Safety
Dose Limiting Toxicity
Study DCT4862g utilizes a standard 3 [ADDRESS_1050550] been 
observed for dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1050551] dose 
of DCDT2980S.  Any patient who did not complete the DLT observation period for any 
reason other than a DLT was replaced.
Separate dose- escalation cohorts enrolled patients with B -cell NHL and CLL.  For the 
NHL dose escalation, DLTs of Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient out of 
3DLT-evaluable patients in the 3.2 mg/kg single- agent cohort and 1 patient out of 
11DLT-evaluable patients in the 2.4 mg/kg + rituximab cohort.  Consequently, 
DCDT2980S at 2.4 mg/kg was determined to be the recommended Phase II dose 
(RP2D) as both monotherapy and in combination with rituximab.  
For the CLL dose -escalation cohorts, one DLT was reported to date.  This Grade 5 event 
of febrile neutropenia resulted in the patient’s death.  W hereas the contribution of the 
study drug to the neutropenia could not be completely ruled out, other factors, including 
bone marrow involvement of disease that resulted in baseline ane mia, thrombocytopenia 
and neutropenia, and clinical evidence of disease progression may have also played a 
contributory role.
Single -Agent DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S Combined with Rituximab in 
NHL
Forty -nine patients received single -agent DCDT2980S at a start ing dose of 1.8mg/kg 
(7at 1.8 mg/kg, 42 at 2.4 mg/kg); 16 patients received DCDT2980S at a starting dose 
of1.8mg/kg in combination with rituximab (5 at 1.8 mg/kg, 11 at 2.4 mg/kg).  Overall 
the safety profile of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab didnot differ from that of 
single -agent DCDT2980S.
Treatment -emergent hematologic and commonly reported nonhematologic adverse 
events forall grades in patients treated with single -agent DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S 
plus rituximab included neutropenia (29%), f ebrile neutropenia (3%), infection ( system

1.2.2 DCDS4501A
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Preclinical Data
CD79b is a cell -surface antigen whose expression is restricted to all mature 
Bcells except plasma cells.  It is expressed in a majority of B cellderived malignancies, 
including nearly all NHL and CLL samples tested (see Figure 2) (Dornan etal.2009 ).  
Antibodies bound to CD79b are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570580], making CD79b ideally suited 
fortargeted delivery of cytotoxic agents ( Polson et al. 2007 ,2009 ).  
Similar to DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A is an ADC that contains a humanized 
immunoglobulin -G1 (IgG1) anti human CD79b MAb (MCDS4409A) and MMAE linked 
through MC -VC-PABC.
Comprehensive pharmacologic, PK, PD, and toxicological evaluations were undertaken to 
support the entry of DCDS4501A into clinical trials.   Because DCDS4501A specifically 
recognizes CD79b on B cells of human but not on those of cynomolgus monkey, rat, or 
mouse, a surrogate ADC (DCDS5017A) that binds to cynomolgus monkey CD79b was 
generated to assess the antigen -dependent pharmacological, toxicological, and PK/PD 
activities in cynomolgus monkeys.  The structure, binding epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], and binding affinity of 
the surrogate ADC are similar to those of DCDS4501A.

FLfollicular lymphoma; MCL mantle cell ly mphoma; MFImean fluorescence intensity; 
MZLmarginal zone ly mphoma. 
CD79b expression levels (MFI) on B-cell tumor cells were assessed by [CONTACT_766208] B -cell ly mphomas:  CLL (n 49), DLBCL (n 59), FL (n 58), 
MCL (n20), and MZL (n 60).
DCDS4501A bound human CD79b with hig h affinity (K d1.830.26 nM); the surrogate 
ADC also showed similar high binding affinity to cynomolgus monkey CD79b.  
DCDS4501A displayed potent and selective inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in vitro 
(IC 500.071 nM0.01 nM) in cell viability assays.  Moderate ADCC but no CDC activity 
was observed with the unconjugated clinical candidate antibody MCDS4409A.  Both 
clinical and surrogate unconjugated antibodies showed no appreciable cytokine release 
when evaluated in in vitro cytokine release assays with PBMCs.  Moderate elevations 
ininterleukin ( IL)-1and interferon -inducible protein ( IP)-10were observed only with the 
unconjugated clinical antibody, however the clinical significance of these observations 
are not know n because IL-1and IP -10are not produced by B cell s, are not involved in 
B-cell signaling through CD79b, and are not associated with cytokine -release syndromes 
invivo.
Single intravenous (IV) doses of DCDS4501A resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in 
murine xenograft models of lymphoma.  Tumor regression was observed at doses 
ranging from 0.5 to 3mg/kg.  In contrast, MCDS4409A showed no activity.  DCDS4501A 
administered at 5 mg/kg demonstrated better anti -tumor activity compared to a current 
standard -of-care regimen (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
and prednisone [R -CHOP]) in xenograft models of NHL.  PD studies demonstrated that 
doses of the surrogate ADC ranging from 0.3 to 5mg/kg resulted in a decrease of 

DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
44/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4peripheral blood Bcells in cynomolgus monkeys.  A preferential decrease of proliferating 
B cell s (CD20Ki67) compared to the resting B cells (CD20Ki67) ) by [CONTACT_766211], in line with the expected mechanism of 
action of an anti-mitotic agent, MMAE.
Due to B cellmediated CL, non -linear pharmacokinetics were observed with the 
surrogate ADC in cynomolgus monkeys following single IV doses of 0.3 3mg/kg or four 
doses of 3 and5mg/kg given Q3 W.  The total antibody exposure aft er the fourth dose 
increased approximately 1.[ADDRESS_1050552] dose.  As expected, the 
toxicokinetic profile of the clinical ADC in rats and cynomolgus monkeys was linear in the 
tested dose range.  Consistent with the half -life of the cl inical ADC, minimal 
accumulation was observed following weekly dosing in rats and no accumulation was 
observed following Q3Wdosing in cynomolgus monkeys.  The free MMAE 
concentrations in plasma following administration of the clinical or surrogate ADCs we re 
generally low and overall did not exceed 2 ng/mL, regardless of dose.  The overall 
incidence of anti -therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) was 20% 67% following administration 
of the clinical or surrogate ADCs in cynomolgus monkeys; however, the ATAs did not 
appear to impact the toxicokinetic/ PK parameter estimates.
In repeat -dose toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, DCDS4501A and 
thesurrogate ADC were well tolerated in monkeys up to doses of 5mg/kg and 3 mg/kg 
respectively, with 3 mg/kg considered the HNSTD.  In rats, DCDS4501A was well 
tolerated up to 6 mg/kg (STD 1010mg/kg).  Thepredominant antigen -independent 
findings associated with DCDS4501A or surrogate ADC exposure were reversible bone 
marrow toxicity and associated periphe ral blood cell effects in both monkeys and rats.  
Administration of the surrogate ADC to monkeys also resulted in expected 
antigen -dependent reversible decreases in peripheral blood B cells and the 
disappearance of B -cell germinal centers in splenic lympho id follicles at doses 3mg/kg.   
Additional findings observed in rats but not in monkeys included thymic lymphoid 
depletion at 6mg/kg, minimal to mild liver toxicities (at 6mg/kg), lung toxicities at 
10mg/kg in male animals only, and a slight incre ase in apoptosis and mitoses in multiple 
tissues, including skin and adnexa.  Hepatobiliary toxicity consisted of transient 
dose- dependent liver enzyme elevations accompanied by [CONTACT_766212]- dependent increases in mitotic figures/apoptosis in hep atocytes, sinusoidal cells, 
and bile duct epi[INVESTIGATOR_766120] -dependent random focal 
hepatic necrosis.  Pulmonary toxicity was characterized by [CONTACT_766212]- dependent alveolar macrophage infiltration, sometimes accompanied by [CONTACT_766213]/hypertrophy.  These findings were consistent with 
the expected pharmacologic effect of MMAE on inducing mitotic arrest due to inhibition 
of tubulin polymerization.  Except for two individual instances ( onefemale given 
10mg/kg in the liver and one male given 10 mg/kg in the lung), these findings were 
completely reversible after a 6- week recovery period.  Non -reversible male reproductive 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
45/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4toxicity, characterized by [CONTACT_766214], was observed 
in rats at all doses.

[IP_ADDRESS] DCDS4501A  Clinical Data
a.Patient E nrollment
Both DCDS4501A monotherapy and combination therapy with rituximab are being 
studied in a Phase I study ( Study DCS4968g) of patients with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell malignancies expected to express CD79b, including indolent NHL, DLBCL, MCL, 
andCLL.  
All data presented herein is based on a data entry cutoff of 28 February 2013, with 
clinical data available from 60 patients with NHL (excluding patients with CLL) enrolled in 
dose- escalation and expansion cohorts.  These include 51 patients who we re treated 
with single -agent DCDS4501A ranging from 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg administered intravenously 
every 21 days and 9 patients who were enrolled into a single Phase Ib cohort with 
DCDS4501A administered at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg in combination with 375 mg/m2
rituximab.
Inthe CLL dose- escalation cohorts ,two DLTs were reported at the single -agent dose of 
1.8mg/kg.  Enrollment into the CLL cohorts was stopped on 7 January 2013.  Refer to 
the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure for details regarding clinical data in CLL patients.  
b.Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of DCDS4501A were characterized in the Phase I Study
DCDS4501A.  DCDS4501A was administered in patients with NHL at escalating doses 
of 0.1to 2.4 mg/kg Q3 Was monotherapy and following administrati on of rituximab in the 
Phase Ib cohort.  Three analytes were quantified: acMMAE, total antibody, and free 
MMAE. 
Preliminary PK analysis based on available data as of 22 June 2012 is summarized 
below.  The CL estimates of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level is in the 
range of 14.9 –21.2 mL/day/kg and 7.12– 27.9 mL/day/kg, respectively .  CL estimates 
were similar across doses of 0.1– 2.4mg/kg tested, suggesting dose -proportional 
increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposure.  The CL of acMMAE was faster than 
that of total antibody at each dose level.  
The mean value of V ssof acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level ranged from 
61to 80.8 mL/kg and from 59.4 to 114.3 mL/kg, respectively, across the dose levels 
tested, which approximated human serum volume. Vssvalues did not appear to change 
substantially with dose. The half -lives for acMMAE and total antibody are from 2.4 to 
5.5days and 2.9 to 7 days, respectively. 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
46/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4In a single -agent dose- escalation study, for acMMAE and total antibody, the t ime to 
maximum concentration occurred immediately after infusion.  For free MMAE, the time to 
maximum concentration was approximately 2 to 3days after infusion.  C maxand AUC infof 
free MMAE appear increased with dose across the dose levels.  A half -life of 3–4days 
for free MMAE was observed, which is relatively long and similar to acMMAE and 
suggests formation ratelimited kinetics for free MMAE.  No accumulation of free MMAE 
is expected for the Q3 Wregimen.  The C maxvalues of free MMAE in NHL patients were 
at least [ADDRESS_1050553] elimination 
once it is formed.  
Preliminary comparisons of pharmacokinetics between patients with NHL and CLL (for 
which patients are enrolled into separate dose -escalation cohorts) treated with identical 
doses of DCDS4501A provide some insight into the factors that affect pharmacokinetics .  
Both acMMAE and total antibody were cleared faster in CLL patients than in NHL 
patients.  This observation is likely to be related to the high number of circulating B cells 
generally observed in CLL patients, which may result in significant target -mediated CLof 
DCDS4501A. Thefree MMAE expos ure in CLL patients was relatively low compared 
with that of its parent conjugate.
To date, PK data for patients treated with DCDS4501A in combination with rituximab is 
limited.  Consequently, full comparison with single- agent DCDS4501A pharmacokinetics
isnot possible.  On the basis of very limited data from 3 patients , total antibody 
pharmacokinetics was comparable between 2.4 mg/kg of DCDS4501A administered as 
a single agent and following rituximab administration, suggesting that when given in 
combination, rituximab does not affect the pharmacokinetics of DCDS4501A; the effect 
of DCDS4501A on rituximab pharmacokinetics will be assessed.  
All observations will be verified with additional data from the ongoing Phase I study as 
well as this study.

48/Protocol GO27834 , Version A41.2.3 Rituximab
Rituximab has been shown to be an effective treatment for CD20 -positive B -cell 
malignancies and is commonly used both as a single agent and in combination with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Rituximab binds to CD20, a hydrophobic, transmembrane 
protein that is present on pre –B cells and mature B cells and in 90% of B -cell NHLs.  
Itexerts its cytotoxic effects via complement -mediated B- cell lysis, ADCC, and induction 
of apoptosis (Cartron et al. 2004).
In the [LOCATION_002], rituximab has been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the following indications in NHL : as a single agent for the 
treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low -grade or follicular, CD20 -positive 
B-cell NHL; for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, low -grade or follicular, 
CD20 -positive B -cell NHL, including initial treatment w eekly for eight doses and 
re-treatment (weekly for four doses) in patients who responded to an initial course of 
rituximab; for the treatment of low -grade, CD20- positive B -cell NHL, in combination with 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) in duction chemotherapy in 
previously untreated patients with follicular, CD20 -positive NHL; as treatment in 
previously untreated patients with low -grade, CD20- positive NHL who achieve an 
objective response or stable disease (SD) following CVP induction; and as maintenance 
therapy for previously untreated follicular CD20- positive B -cell NHL after achieving a 
response to a regimen including chemotherapy and rituximab.
Inthe European Union, rituximab (MabThera®) is approved for the treatment of the 
following indications in NHL: treatment of patients with Stage III–IV follicular NHL who 
are chemotherapy -resistant or in their second or subsequent relapse after 
chemotherapy; treatment of patients with CD20 -positive DLBCL in combination with 
cyclophosphamide, dox orubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy; as
front-line therapy in Stage III–IV follicular NHL in combination with CVP chemotherapy; 
as maintenance therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory, follicular NHL responding 
to induction tre atment with CHOP or R-CHOP; and as maintenance treatment for 
patients with FLwho have responded to initial treatment with rituximab plus 
chemotherapy.
Rituximab has also been approved for the treatment of CLL.  The European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) granted an approval for the use of rituximab in combination with 
chemotherapy for previously untreated CLL.  The FDA approved the use of rituximab in 
combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for patients with previously 
untreated and previously treated CD 20-positive CLL.  
Refer to the Rituxi mab Investigator’s Brochure for complete details regarding clinical 
data related to approved indications.  For rituximab safety information, refer to local 
rituximab prescribing information.

[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Mechanism of A ction
Obinutuzumab ([G], also known as RO5072759, GA101, Gazyva , and Gazyvaro ) is a 
humanized type II and glycoengineered anti-CD20 MAb, derived by [CONTACT_766216] B- Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent glycoengineering leading to the 
following characteristics ( Mössner et al. 2010 ; Gola y et al. 2013 ):
High-affinity binding to CD20 antigen on B cells
Type II binding mode to the CD20 antigen, leading to a more even distribution of 
bound antibody to the surface membrane of the B cell due to lack of CD20 
translocation into lipid rafts after antibody binding and low complement activation 
and low complement -dependent cytotoxicity related to the recognition of the CD20 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] 
Comp ared with the type I anti -CD20 antibodies rituximab or ofatumumab, increased 
ADCC and antibody -dependent cell -mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) related to an 
improved binding of obinutuzumab to the different allotypes of Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIIb 
expressed by [CONTACT_766217] (NK) cells , monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils
Compared with rituximab, increased direct cell-death induction related to an elbow 
hinge amino exchange of the Fab region and type II binding of the CD20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_766121] 2013 and EMA approval in 
July2014 on the basis of the CLL- 11 Study BO21004 for patients with relapsed Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia.  Obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil showed superiority over 
rituximab plus chlor ambucil in all efficacy parameters such as overall response rate 
(ORR) , complete remission rate ( CRR) , minimal residu aldisease ( MRD ), 
progression -free survival ( PFS), event -free survival ( EFS),and duration of response 
(DOR) ( Goede et al. 2014).
Obinutuzumab is currently being explored in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies 
such as agg ressive and indolent lymphomas (DLBCL, FL, and marginal zone lymphoma 
[MZL]).  Preliminary data suggest possible increased anti -lymphoma efficacy over 
rituximab, a hypothesis that is currently being explored in several randomized trials, 
including a Phase III study of R -CHOP versus G -CHOP in first-line treatment of DLBCL, 
a Phase III study of R -chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP, or bendamust ine) followed by 
[CONTACT_766218] G -chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine) 
followed by [CONTACT_766219]-linetreatment of FL and MZL,and a 
Phase III study of obinutuzumab combined with bendamustine compared with 
bend amustine in patients with rituximab -refractory indolent NHL.
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Toxicology
The nonclinical toxicology of obinutuzumab has been evaluated in repeat -dose studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys given weekly IV (30- minute infusion) up to 26weeks in duration 
and weekly SC injections for 4 weeks in duration.  The high dose of 50 mg/kg in the 
26-week study resulted in a steady -state area under the concentration- time curve from 0 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
50/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4to 24 hours ( AUC 024) exposure of 341,000 ghr/mL , which is approximately 61 -fold 
above that of the clinical exposure of 5584 ghr/mL.
Consistent with expected pharmacologic activity, obinutuzumab caused marked 
decreases in B cells ,with corresponding lymphoid depletion in spleen and lymph nodes.  
Circulating CD40 -positive mature B cells began to reverse after several months without 
treatment and maximally reversed to 7% 152% of baseline by 37 weeks.  In addition, 
transient decreases in NK cells were observed; this finding is consistent with the 
pharmacologic e ffect of FcRIIIa binding.  Suspected opportunistic infections in as many 
as three unscheduled deaths were considered a possible secondary result of B -cell 
depletion.
Obinutuzumab was immunogenic in the cynomolgus monkey, which led to reduced 
systemic exposures in several animals and abrogation of the pharmacologic activity. 
Hypersensitivity reactions were noted that included systemic inflammation and infiltrates 
consistent with immune complex mediated hypersensiti vity reactions such as 
arteritis/periarteritis, glomerulonephritis, and serosal/adventitial inflammation and led to 
unscheduled termination in six animals.
Both the clinical IV formulation and the SC formulation of obinutuzumab were locally well 
tolerated across studies.  No effects were present in male and female reproductive 
parameters included in the [ADDRESS_1050555] infusion related cytokine release in patients.
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Efficacy
Obinutuzumab has in vivo efficacy superior to rituximab in various human lymphoma 
xenograft models.  Both antibodies were tested in human SUDHL -4 cells (DLBCL model) 
injected subcuta neously in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice.  
Rituximab administration was started when tumors were established and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_766122].  Results showed that rituximab at 10 mg/kg inhibited tumor growth compared 
with rituximab at 1 mg/kg; howe ver, increasing the rituximab dose to 30 mg/kg did not 
result in increased efficacy and rituximab was not able to achieve complete tumor 
regression .  In contrast, obinutuzumab showed a dose- dependent increase in efficacy in 
the range of 1 30mg/kg.  Result s showed complete tumor regression in all animals and 
lasting tumor eradication in [ADDRESS_1050556] dose of 30 mg/kg and in 
1of10 animals at a dose of 10 mg/kg.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
51/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4In another experiment, SUDHL4 xenografts in SCID mice were first treated with w eekly 
rituximab 30 mg/kg. When the tumors became refractory to rituximab ( Day35), 
rituximab treatment was continued or changed to either weekly vehicle control or 
obinutuzumab 30 mg/kg. While tumors in control -and rituximab -treated mice continued 
to grow, obinutuzumab -treated mice showed control of tumor growth and lived until 
Day61 when control or rituximab- treated mice had already been sacrificed.  
Additional studies have also shown similar results, with obinutuzumab treatment 
controlling tumor grow th, whereas vehicle -and rituximab -treated tumors were not 
controlled ( Mössner et al. 2010 ).
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Clinical Experience
As of July 2013, more than [ADDRESS_1050557] 
been treated with obinutuzumab in clinical trials.  Clinical data for obinutuzumab are 
available from six clinical trials, including three Phase I and Phase II studies of 
obinutuzumab monotherapy, a Phase Ib chemotherapy combination study in NHL 
(Study BO21000), and two Phase III studies ( Study BO21004 in CLL and 
Study GAO4753g in NHL).
Infusion -related reactions (I RRs), mostly Grade s1 and 2, are the most common adverse 
events observed during therapy.  IRRs have been associated predominantly with the first 
infusion, generally occurring early during the infusion, shortly after the infusion, or ,in 
some cases, up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion.  In a few patients, 
concur rent signs of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were observed.  The 
incidence and intensity of IRRs decreased strongly with subsequent infusions of 
obinutuzumab.  On the basis of preliminary observations, extensive tumor burden, tumor 
factors, and host factors may be predisposing factors for the occurrence of IRRs. The 
frequency and severity of IRRs is also reduced in lymphomas compared with CLL.
Other frequently observed adverse events include infections and neutropenia.
Grade 3[ADDRESS_1050558] been 
reported with obinutuzumab, associated predominantly with treatment of CLL rather than 
NHL.  Given its anticipated mode of action ,which results in profound B -cell depletion, 
obinutuzumab may be assoc iated with an increased risk of infections during and after
treatment.
Data from Study BO20999 (obinutuzumab monotherapy) showed safety and efficacy of 
single -agent obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed indolent and aggressive 
lymphomas.  Responses were s een at both lower (400 mg) and higher (1600/800 mg) 
doses, although responses increased at the higher dose, with 54% of patients with 
indolent lymphoma and 32% of patients with aggressive lymphomas showing PR or CR 
at the end of treatment (EOT) (Morschhauser et al. 2013; Salles et al. 2013).  
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
52/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Study BO21000 (Ph ase Ib) evaluated obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy:  
obinutuzumab with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and obinutuzumab with CHOP 
(Radf ord et al. 2013).  Both chemotherapy combinations were shown to be feasible in 
patients with previously untreated or relapsed or refractory FL, with response rates of 
90% for both regimens.  Safety was acceptable, with no new or unexpected adverse 
events observed.  The most common adverse event was neutropenia.
Data from obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in CLL ( Phase III 
Study BO21004) showed increased efficacy of th iscombination over 
rituximab- chlor ambucil, with a hazard ratio of 0.39 for PFS.  IRRs were common (65% all 
grade s, 20% Grade 3 4, no fatal IRRs) and neutropenia occurred at increased 
frequency with the combination therapy (33% Grade 3 5), but there was no increase in 
infections or treatment -related deaths (Goede et al. 2014).
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on the clinical 
studies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
A two- compartment model comprising a time-varying CLpathway and a linear CL
pathway provides an adequate description of the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab 
following IV administration in Study BO20999 and Study BO21003.  Following the 
infusion of obinutuzumab , the elimination appears to be characterized by a linear CL
pathway that is dependent on time (i.e .,starting at a typi[INVESTIGATOR_27797] 630 mL/day and 
then gradually decreasing to an asymptote of 60
mL/day at steady state).  Tumor burden 
may potentially contribute significantly to the CLofobinutuzumab, especially at the 
beginning of treatment when CD20 -positive tumor cells are most abundant.  As tumor 
burden decreases, the CLreaches an asymptote, which is considered to be primarily a 
function of the proteolytic metabolic CL.  Some patients with a high tumor burden may 
appear to clear the drug from the plasma faster than patients with a low tumor burden 
because obinutuzumab binds to the CD20- positive tumor cells and is effectively 
removed from the plasma.  The CLof the drug will vary with time because repeated 
treatments with obinutuzumab will reduce the quantity of CD20 -positive tumor cells.  The 
number of times obinutuzumab is administered during the first cycle of treatment may be 
expected to reduce the number of CD20 -positive tumor cells, thus minimizing the impact 
of the time-varying CLpathway on obinutuzumab exposure.
Treatment with obinutuzumab resulted in extensive B -cell depletion, with all patients 
showing a reduction in B -cell counts to absolute zero at some stage of their treatment 
cycle.  Overall, there has been no notable increase in complement levels before and 
after infusion, but transient increases occurring during the administration of 
obinutuzumab have been observed in the levels of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF
)-, 
interleukin (IL) -6, IL-8, IL-10,and interferon ( IFN)-.

The goals of this study are to continue to assess the safety, tolerability, and biologic and 
clinical activity of the combinations of DCDT2980S and rituximab and DCDS4501A and 
rituximab in two specific NHL patient populations:  patients with relapsed or refractory 
follicular NHL and patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.  An additional goal of this 
study is to assess the safety, tolerability ,and potential biologic and clinical activity of 
DCDS4501A in combination with obinutuzumab , an anti -CD20 antibody, in the 
aforementioned NHL patient populations.  These patients continue to have an extremely 
poor prognosis with no curative options available.  Consequent ly,new therapeutic 
options are needed.  
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A , rituximab ,and obinutuzumab each target antigens specific 
to B-cell malignancies including follicu lar NHL and DLBCL (see Figure 1  and Figure 2). 
The randomized component of the Phase II stud y design permits an assessment of the 
clinical benefit provided by [CONTACT_766220], which 
has established clinical activity in B -cell malignancies both as monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy.  Data from this study will help inform the feasibility of 
the combination regimens in earlier lines of therapy ( e.g., as first-line therapy in newly 
diagnosed patients ).  
Thenon-randomized component of the study will further evaluate the safety and 
tolerability and c linical activity of DCDS4501A in combination with obinutuzumab in 
patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma or DLBCL and will also provide 
preliminary evidence as to which anti -CD20 agent, rituximab or obinutuzumab, in 
combination with DCDS4 501A, provides a better benefit -risk profile in the target 
population being studied. 
The feasibility of combining an ADC with rituximab has previously been tested clinically 
with the combination of another, different CD22 -specific ADC, inotuzumab ozogamic in 
(CMC -544), with results suggesting that the addition of rituximab may have increased 
clinical activity without significant increase in toxicity over the ADC alone in patients with 
aggressive NHL ( Fayad et al. 2006; Nam et al. 2009 ; Nina etal. 2010) .  As noted in 
Section 1.2.[ADDRESS_1050559] acceptable safety in patients with 
relapsed or refractory NHL in the Phase I studies ( Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g).  
Given the relatively poor prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic 
malignancies that have failed standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ,the nonclinical toxicity pro file 
associated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A treatment, and the clinical safety profile 
observed to date for both ADCs, the benefit -riskratio of a clinical study of DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A, each combined with rituximab or obinutuzumab , is considered 
acceptable. 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
54/Protocol GO27834 , Version A41.3.1 Rational e for A ssessing A DC Dose of 1.8 mg/kg Combined 
with Rituximab in iNHL
On the basis of available Phase I data (see Section 1.2.1 andSection 1.2.2 ), both 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A as single agents and combined with rituximab have 
shown early s igns of clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or
refract ory NHL.  However, early evidence in the Phase I studies indicate that duration of 
study treatment may be limited by [CONTACT_766221].  Specifically, for both ADCs, 
periphe ral sensory neuropathy has been identified as a known risk (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Notably, [ADDRESS_1050560] shown single -agent activity at the 1.8 mg/kg dose 
level ( Advani et al. 2012 ; Palanca -Wessels et al.2012 ), the purpose of enrolling 
additional cohorts of patients with FLis to determine whether lower doses of ADC in 
combination with standard doses of rituximab res ult in improved tolerability while 
maintaining efficacy in FL.  
In contrast to iNHL, treatment paradigms in relapsed orrefract ory aggressive 
lymphomas such as DLBCL continue to place a premium on anti -tumor activity and 
higher tolerance for treatment -related toxicity ,given that the duration of disease control 
and survival are substantially shorter and that treatment options are extremely limited.  
Early Phase I data suggest lower rates of study treatment discontinuation for adverse 
events among patients with DLBCL compared with patients with i NHL.  Taken together 
with anti -tumor activity observed to date, the benef it-riskprofile of the currently tested 
ADC dose of 1.8mg/kg is considered acceptable to combine with rituxminab in the 
treatment of patients with iNHL.
1.3.[ADDRESS_1050561] ory NHL
The development of next -generation anti -CD20 directed therapy may further enhance 
the efficacy of current standard regimens for NHL.  Obinutuzumab ,also known as 
RO5072759, GA101 ,and Gazyva /Gazyvaro , a novel type II and glycoengineered 
anti-CD20 antibody, has shown superiority over rituximab in a Phase III trial in first -line 
CLL ( Goede et al .2014 ).Obinutuzumab is c urrently being compared with rituximab in 
two large Phase III studies in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL (Study BO21005) 
and with previously untreated iNHL, including FL (Study BO21223).  Assuming these 
studies demonstrate greater clinical benefit with obinutuzumab -vs. rituximab- containing 
regimens, potentially altering the standard of care in NHL, it will be important to also 
assess the safety and efficacy of combining DCDS4501A with obinutuzumab -containing 
regimens.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY 
This is a Phase Ib/II, multicenter, open-label study.  Up to approximately 246 patients 
with relapsed or refractory  FL and DLBCL will be enrolled at approximately 
30−40 investi gative sites worldwide.  Additional patients may be enrolled in order to 
obtain additional safety and/or efficacy data.  Arms A and B and Cohort C are no longer 
enrolling patients . 
For Obinutuzumab Cohorts:  
Only investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002] will enroll patients into Cohort E.  
Investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002]  and worldwide will participate in Cohorts G 
and H.

[IP_ADDRESS] Randomized Portion of the Study (A rms A andB)Closed to 
Enrollment
Following determination of eligibility, patients within each disease group will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments:
Arm A: Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S (2.4 mg/kg) every 21 days;
Arm B: Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A (2.4 mg/kg) every [ADDRESS_1050562] to the 
following stratification factors:
For patients with FL(see Section 3.1.4 for definitions)
Rituximab refractory disease (no response or disease relapse 6months from 
last rituximab treatment) v ersus rituximab relapsed disease (disease relapse 
after response 6months from last rituximab treatment)
For patie nts with DLBCL (see Section 3.1.5 fordefinitions)
Second- line versus third-line (or beyond) therapy
For second- line patients, disease relapse or no objective response (CR,
unconfirmed CR [C Ru],or PR) <12months from the start of initial therapy versus 
disease relapse, after initial objective response (CR, unconfirmed response 
[CRu] or PR), 12months from start of initial therapy 
For third -line patients, failure to achieve a CR or progression < 6months from 
start of most recent therapy versus CR or progression ≥ 6months from start of 
most recent therapy
No formal testing comparing the two treatment arms in the randomized portion of the 
study is planned.
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-R andomized Portion of the Study with Rituximab 
(Cohort sC andD)Closed to Enrollment
Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the non -randomized 
portion of the study will enroll patients into these cohorts.
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled in Cohort sC and D to 
receive rituximab (375 mg/m2) combined with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A at a dose of 
1.8mg/kg.  The first day of treatment constitut es Day 1 of each cycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766123] 21 days in duration.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
60/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s discretion and only after 
the enrollment of patients with FL into the randomized portion of the study is completed.   
Patients will not be randomized to receive one treatment or the other.  It is anticipated 
that Cohort C and D will be opened sequentially.
3.1.2 All Patients on Rituximab -Containing A rms/Cohorts
All patients on rituximab -containing regimens , regardless of assigned arm/cohort ,will 
receive DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab administered by [CONTACT_766203] a 
21-daycycle.  For the first two cycles, rituximab will be administered by [CONTACT_398259]1 and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A will be administered by [CONTACT_95077]2.  
Inthe absence of any infusion- related adverse events, rituximab and DCDT2980S or 
DCDS4501A may be administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent cycles 
beginning with the third cycle.  In this instance, rituximab will be administered first, 
followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S or DCDS4501A.  In certain circumstances for example ,IRRs
requiring interruption or slowing of infusion rate rituximab may be administered over 
2days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the cycle ); in this case, DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A 
may be ad ministered on Day 2 following completion of the rituximab infusion or on Day 3 
of the cycle.
Patients may receive treatments for up to 1 year (17 cycles on an every -21-day 
schedule) if not discontinued because of significant toxicity, disease progression, or 
withdrawal from study.
Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the Schedules 
ofAssessments outlined in Appendices A-1, A-2,andA-4.  Initial response assessments 
in this study will be performed every 3 months from the initiation of therapy until study 
treatment completion or early termination (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1050563] eight 21-day cycles of treatment).  Additional 
response assessments for patients who proceed to cross over treatment 
(see Section 3.1.6 )will be performed as described in Appendix A-2; response 
assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment (both initia lly assigned 
treatment and crossover treatment) for reasons other than disease progression will be 
performed as described in Appendix A-4.
Responses to study treatment will be based on investigator assessments.  In addition, 
tumor assessment data will be transmitted to an Independent Review Facility (IRF) for 
collection and possible independent review.
3.1.3 Obinutuzumab -Containing Regimen with DCDS4501A  
(Cohorts E, G, and H)
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg will be given in combination with obinutuzumab to patients 
with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and DLBCL in two stages: (1) safety run -in and 
(2) expansion .
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
61/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Study treatment will be given in [ADDRESS_1050564] cycle, obinutuzumab will 
be administered by [CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, and 15.  DCDS4501A will be given on Day 
2 for Cycle 1.  In the absence of any infusion -related adverse events, obinutuzumab and 
DCDS4501A may be administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent cycles 
beginning with the second cycle.  If obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A are administered on 
the same day, the study drugs will be given sequentially.  Obinutuzumab will be 
administered first, followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A.  In certain circumstances for example, 
IRRs requiring interruption or slowing of infusion rate obinutuzumab may be 
administered over 2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the cycle); in this case, DCDS4501A 
may be administered on Day 2 following completion of the obinutuzumab infusion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab -Conta ining Regimen in Phase Ib: Safety  Run -In 
(Cohort E)
This portion of the study will consist of a safety run -in that will evaluate the safety of 
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in 6 patients (C ohort E).  
The safety run -in is described in detail in Section 3.4.  
Obinutuzumab -Containing Regimens in Phase II:  Expansion Stage 
(Cohorts G and H)
After the safety run -in has demonstrated that DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination 
with obinutuzumab is safe to administer, patients will be enrolled into two expansion 
cohorts based on histology of follicular NHL or DLBCL (Cohorts G and H ,respectively). 
Forty patients will be enrolled into each expansion cohort. An additional cohort(s) may 
be added in the future.
3.1.4 Follicular NHL Patients f or Rituximab -Containing 
Arms/Cohorts
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled into the study as 
defined by [CONTACT_716]:
Relapsed as documented history of response (CR, C Ru, or PR) of 6months in 
duration from completion of all prior rituximab- containing regimens.  A 
rituximab- containing regimen is defined as rituximab as a single agent during 
induction and/or maintenance or in combination with other agents during induction 
and/or maintenan ce.
Refractory to any prior regimen containing rituximab, defined as no response to or

patients must have received at least one full dose (375 mg/m2) of rituximab.
 
DCDT2980S  and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.  
62/Protocol GO27834, Version A4 Patients with no objective response (PR or CR) to a rituximab-containing regimen 
consisting of at least [ADDRESS_1050566] 4 cycles of  rituximab combined with chemotherapy  
 
Enrollment of patients with refractory disease as defined above may be limited to no 
greater than 60% of the total follicular NHL cohort, in order to avoid overrepresentation 
of the refractory disease population.

3.1.8 Crossover Treatment (Randomized Patients in Arms A and B
Only )
Patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B who develop progressive disease may be 
eligible to receive crossover treatment consisting of rituximab and the other ADC or the 
other ADC alone for example ,Arm B treatment for patients who have disease 
progression while receiving Arm A treatment ,and vice ver saprovided the following 
conditions are met:
Patients must not have experienced a toxicity requiring the discontinuation of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment OR experienced toxicity during the last dose of 
study treatment that would preclude treatment with th e crossover regimen.
Patients who had modifications to dosing and/or schedule on the initial study 
treatment will be permitted to receive crossover treatment in the absence of 
toxicities on the modified dose and/or schedule.  The dose and schedule of 
crossover treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_40906].
Patients who had rituximab discontinued and continued on single -agent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment may receive crossover treatment of 
single -agent DCDS4501A/ DCDT2980S .
Patients must have radiographically documented disease progression.
Patients must me et all inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Section 4.1.1
and Section 4.1.2 , except for those related to prior rituximab treatment.
Acceptable toxicity:  All study drug–related adverse events from the initial study 
treatment must have decreased to Grade [ADDRESS_1050568] 
day of treatment on the crossover regimen.  Exceptions may be allowed after a 
careful assessment and discussion of the benef it-riskbalance with the patient by [CONTACT_766223].
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
64/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Administration of crossover treatment must be in the best interests of the patient as
determined after a careful assessment and discussion of benefit -riskbalance with 
the patient by [CONTACT_766224].
A tumor biopsy ( see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be required for patients with safely 
accessible site of disease, defined as requiring only local anesthesia and ,in 
general ,excluding the brain, lungs or any internal organs that may subject patients 
to significant risk. 
Patients for whom a safely accessible site of disease is not present may still 
receive crossover treatment without undergoing a biopsy.  Eligibility to receive 
crossover treatment should be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_22955].
A tumor biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease is optional for patients who 
are not eligible for study cross over. 
Patients who are determined to be eligible for study cross over will be treated as follows:
Assessments obtained at the initial study treatment discontinuation visit 
(seeSection 4.5.4 ) may be used as screening assessments for crossover treatment.  
The following re- screening assessments must be repeated/obtained wi thin 1 week 
prior to starting treatment on the crossover regimen ,in order to re -establish baseline 
pretreatment clinical and disease status:  targeted physical exam, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG )status ,and hematology and serum chemistry 
laboratory tests.
Re-screening tests for hepatitis B and C do not need to be performed unless 
there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_136701] B and/or C positivity.
A radiographic tumor assessment must also be performed, unless already done 
to document disease progression, within 6 weeks prior to starting crossover 
treatment.
Crossover treatment will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1050569] dose of the prior 
study treatment.
Patients will be treated with the crossover treatment until a second disease progress ion 
event relative to the tumor assessment ,documenting progressive disease on the initial 
study treatment, clinical deterioration ,and/or intolerance to the crossover treatment for 
up to a maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an every -21-day schedule).  Patien ts will be 
evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules of assessments outlined in 
Appendices A -2.  Response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment 
for reasons other than disease progression w ill be performed as described in 
Appendix A-4. 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
65/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Clinical data and exploratory data derived from tumor biopsies obtained prior to 
crossover treatment will be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Genentech has the right to 
restrict o r suspend enrollment into crossover treatment at any time.  Reasons for this 
may include, but are not limited to, the following:
The incidence or severity of adverse events during crossover treatment indicates a 
potential safety hazard to patients.
Patient enrollment into crossover treatment is unsatisfactory.
Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete. 
Patients who are enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C, 
D,E, G, and H ) will not have the option to receive crossover treatment upon disease 
progression (see Section 3.2for rationale).
3.[ADDRESS_1050570] study treatment and following progressive disease will 
provide further understanding of disease biology, possible mechanisms of resistance to 
the study treatment ,and initial insights into tumor subtypes based on tumor biomarkers 
that are sensitive to study treatment.  Finally, the inclusion of study treatment crossover 
(seeSection 3.1.8 ) will address important questions regarding efficacy and tolerability of 
a second ADC -rituximab combination following diseas e progression on the initial 
ADC- rituximab combination. 
The primary rationale for the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohort s Cand D )is 
to assess the therapeutic index (i.e.,the balance of efficacy and tolerability of 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg in patients with relapsed or 
refractory follicular NHL ).  An informal comparison between patients with follicular NHL 
treated at the two doses of the ADC will help determine if tolerability is improved at the 
lower ADC dose without substa ntial compromise of efficacy. 
The clinical feasibility of an ADC -rituximab combination regimen in patients with relapsed
or refractory NHL has been previously studied.  Results from studies of rituximab in 
combination with a different CD22- specific ADC, i notuzumab ozogamicin, demonstrated 
that when combined with rituximab ,the ADC was able to be given at the single -agent 
MTD without the need for dose reduction of the ADC because of the lack of significant 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171] ( Fayad etal. 2006 ; Nam etal.2009 ; Nina et al. 2010 ).
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A were both evaluated as single agents and in combination 
with rituximab in thePhase I studies Study DCT4862g and Study DCS4968g, 
respectively.  Results from these trials have determined an MTD of 2.4 mg/kg for 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
66/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4single -agent DCDT2980S and an RP2D of 2.4 mg/kg for single -agent DCDS4501A in 
patients with mixed NHL.  In addition, the RP2D of DCT2980S and DCDS4501 each in 
combin ation with rituximab (375 mg/m 2) on an every -21-day schedule was determined 
to be 2.4 mg/kg.  
Study GO27834 will continue to assess the cumulative safety and longer -term tolerability 
of ADC -rituximab combination therapy.   Due to additional information abo ut the benefit -
risk profile of DCDS4501A at the 2.4 mg/kg dose, the Sponsor is no longer pursuing the 
2.4 mg/kg dose of DCDS4501A in the obinutuzumab -containing cohorts.
The primary rationale for the non- randomized Phase Ib/II obinutuzumab -containing 
cohor ts (Cohorts E H) is to assess safety and clinical activity for the combination of 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL (Cohorts E, G, 
and H ).  Obinutuzumab (also known as RO5072759, GA101 and Gazyva /Gazyvaro ), 
a novel typeII and glycoengineered anti -CD20 antibody, has shown superiority over 
rituximab in a Phase III trial in first -line CLL ( Goede et al .2014 ).  Obinutuzumab is 
currently being compared with rituximab in two large Phase III studies in patients with 
newly diagnosed DLBCL (Study BO21005) and previously untreated iNHL, including FL 
(Study BO21223).  Assuming these studies demonstrate greater clinical benefit with 
obinutuzumab -vs. rituximab- containing regimens, potentially altering the standard of 
care in NHL, it will be important to also assess the safety and efficacy of combining 
DCDS4501A with obinutuzumab -containing regimens.
Study drug dosing will occur on Days 1 or2 of each 21- day (or 28 -day) cycle to allow for 
recovery from pote ntial bone marrow toxicity.
3.2.[ADDRESS_1050571] of peripheral B-cellcounts, tumor 
burden, and t arget antigen expression on target -mediated drug CLover multiple doses 
ofDCDT2980S or DCDS4501A plus rituximab or obinutuzumab when the two drugs are 
given in combination, the drug levels of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A- related analytes 
and rituximab or obinutuzumab will be assessed in this combination study.  
In Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, single -agent DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A 
administered by [CONTACT_33433] 21 days were evaluated at doses ranging from 0.1 to 
3.2mg/kg for DCDT2980S and 0.1 mg/kgto 2.4 mg/kg for DCDS4501A in patients with 
NHL.  Intensive PK sampling of all patients in the ongoing Phase I studies will provide 
sufficient data to allow complete profiling of the distribution and elimination phases for 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A and the investigation of potential correlations between 
various PK parameters and efficacy and/or toxicity.  Consequently a reduced PK 
sampling scheme of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A will be used in this study. 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
67/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4The PK data collected in this study will allow fur ther ch aracterization of the PK properties 
of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  In addition, the DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A 
concentration results from this study will be compared with available data from the 
single -agent clinical studies to evaluate whether concurrent administration of rituximab 
affects the exposure of DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A.  
Rituximab serum concentration measurements from this study will be compared with 
PKdata from historical rituximab clinical studies to evaluate whether the combination 
with DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A affects the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. 
Limited sampling of serum concentrations of obinutuzumab will be assessed and 
compared with historical data to evaluate potential PK interactions with DCDS4501A.

• Measurements of protocol -specified hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory 
values  
• Measurements of protocol -specified vital signs  
• Assessment of ECGs  
• Assessment of physical findings on clinical physical examinations  
 
Patient s who have an ongoing study drug− related adverse event will be followed until 
the event has resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_766227], new  anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient 
withdraws consent, it is determined that the study treatment or participation is not the 
cause of the adverse event, or the study is terminated.  
See Section 5.2.3 for assessment of causality for adverse events.  
3.4.1 Safety Run -In Analysis  
As outlined in Figure 3 b and Section [IP_ADDRESS], a safety run-in analysis (Cohort E) will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_514866] (IMC) to evaluate the combination of DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg with obinutuzumab.  This analysis will include data 
from the first [ADDRESS_1050576] cycle.  The decision to enroll an additional 3 patients will be made by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor in consultation with the safety science leader, biostatistician, and participating investigators.  At the IMC’s discretion, and at any point 
during enrollment of the safety run-in, a decision could be made that more than 
6 patients are needed to evaluate safety.   Additional patients may also be enrolled at 
dose levels below 1.8 mg/kg of DCDS4501A (i.e. , 1.4 mg/kg) based upon review of all 
safety data.    
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
71/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Safety summaries will be assessed at the safety run- in for SAEs; Grade 3 -5treatment -
related AEs; all AEs; all Grade 3- 5 AEs; and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or 
dose modification/interruption .
During the 6-patient safety run- in, if any patient experiences a treatment -related 
death, then the obinutuzumab- containing portion of the study will be closed to 
further recruitment.
During the 6- patient safety run- in:
If [ADDRESS_1050577] 3 patients enrolled ex perience Grade 4 febrile neutropenia 
or serious (i.e., SAE) documented infection requiring IV antibio tics in the 
presence of Grade 3 4 neutropenia, then the obinutuzumab -containing portion of 
the study will be closed to further recruitment

Before the expans ion portion of the study can begin (enrollment of 
Cohorts Gand H), six patients must have compl eted the safety observation 
period (Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 2 Day 1 for a minimum of 21 days) in the safety 
run-in (Cohort E).
3.4.2 Internal Monitoring Committee
This study will employ an Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC). The purpose of the IMC 
will be to make recommendations regarding study conduct on the basis of trial safety 
data to ensure patient safety while receiving study treatment.
The IMC will include the [COMPANY_002]/Genentech Medical Monitor, at least one other Clinical 
Science representative who is not directly involved in the study , a Drug Safety Scientist, 
a biostatistician, and a statistical programmer.  Representatives from other Sponsor 
functional area s may be included as additional ad hoc members. In addition to the 
ongoing assessment of the incidence and nature of adverse events, serious adverse 
events, and laboratory abnormalities by [CONTACT_82171], the 
IMCwill review the a forementioned data at least twice during the study. 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
72/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Throughout the course of the study, the IMC will meet at regular intervals during the 
study and at the request of the Medical Monitor ( e.g., on the basis of unexpected safety 
signals).  The IMC may make recommendations regarding study conduct, including, but 
not limited to, performing additional safety analyses, amending the study protocol, 
holding patient enrollment to one or both treatment arms pending further safety 
evaluations, holding/discontinuing s tudy treatment, or terminating the study.
Specific operational details such as the committee’s composition, frequency and timing 
of meetings and members’ roles and responsibilities will be detailed in the IMC charter.
For Arms A and B: The first planned review will occur after approximately [ADDRESS_1050580] 6 weeks 
follow -up.
3.4.3 Risks A ssociated with DCDT2980S a nd DCDS4501A
The clinical safety profile of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A based on clinical data 
obtained in the ongoing Phase I studies are summarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Known and suspected risks, based on clinical data to date, are 
descri bed below.  Guidelines regarding the management of these risks through dose 
and schedule modifications are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  
Refer also to the Investigator’s Brochure for complete and updated details.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion -Related Events
Some MAbs may be associated with the development of allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions, to either the active protein or excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  True allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions are rare after the first dose of a product, as they require prior sensitization.   
Patients with true allergic or anaphylactic reactions should not receive further doses of 
the product.
MAbs may also be associated with reactions that are clinically indistinguishable from 
true allergic or anaphylactic reactions but are mediated through direct release of 
cytokines or other pro -inflammatory mediators.  Such reactions are often termed IRRs .  
IRRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_570587] a MAb product and are generally less 
frequent and/or less severe with subsequent infusions.  They can o ften be managed by 
[CONTACT_570664]/or pre -treatment with various medications.
Allergic or anaphylactic reactions and IRRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_766124].  The onset of symptoms may be rapid, and some reactions 
may be life threatening.
Patients should be monitored for these types of reactions during and after receiving 
DCDT2908S and DCDS4501A.  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A should be administered 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
73/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4in an environment under close supervision of a physician and w here full resuscitation 
facilities are immediately available.  Specific guidelines for additional precautions to be 
taken during and following DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A administration are provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome
There is a potential risk of TLS if treatment with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A results in 
the rapid destruction of a large number of tumor cells.  If any evidence of this occurs 
during the study, TLS prophylaxis measures will be instituted.  Patients who are 
considered to have a high tumor burden (e.g., lymphocyte count 25109/L)or bulky 
lymphadenopathy and who are considered to be at risk for TLS by [CONTACT_766228] (e.g., allopurinol 300mg/day orally or a suitable alternative 
treatment according to institutional practice starting 12 24hours prior to study 
treatment) and must be well hydrated prior to the initiation of study treatment at Cycle 1, 
Day1.  These patients should continue to receive repeated prophylaxis with allopurinol 
and adequate hydration prior to each subsequent infusion as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1275].
[IP_ADDRESS] Bone Marrow Toxicity /Neutropenia
Based on preclinical toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and clinical data 
from the ongoing P hase I Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, neutropenia has been 
identified as a known risk (adverse drug reaction) of both DCDT2908S and 
DCDS4501A.  Neutropenia and neutropenia -associated events were reversible but in 
some cases resulted in protocol -mandated dose reductions and/or delays.  
Adequate hematologic function should be confirmed before initiation of study treatment.  
Patients receiving study treatment will be regularly monitored for evidence of marrow 
toxicity with complete blood counts.  Study treatm ent may be delayed or modified due to 
hematologic toxicities , as described in Section 4.3.1 .
The use of G -CSF for neutropeni a is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Transfusion support 
for anemia and thrombocytopenia is also permitted at the discretion of the treating 
physician.
Febrile neutropenia is commonly associated with myelotoxicity, which is considered a 
class effect of MMAE because it is commonly reported with ADCETRIS, other similar 
ADCs, and vincristine sulfate.
Clinical data show that among the mos t common SAEs reported in both DCS4968g and 
DCT4862g studies were febrile neutropenia and pyrexia.
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity
As expected with any recombinant antibody, DCDT2980S ,DCDS4501A, a nd 
obinutuzumab may elicit an immune response and patients may develop antib odies 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
74/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4against DCDT2980S ,DCDS4501A , orobinutuzumab .  Patients will be closely monitored 
for any potential immune response to DCDT2980S ,DCDS4501A, and obinutuzumab .  
Appropriate screening and confirmatory assays will be employed to detect ATAs at 
multiple timepoints before, during, and after treatment with DCDT2980S , DCDS4501A, 
and obinutuzumab .  Considering the historically low immunogenicity rate of rituximab in 
NHL patients, ATAs against rituximab will not be monitored in this study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Neuropathy
On the basis of clinical data from the ongoing Phase I Studies DCT4862g and 
DCS4968g and data from brentuximab vedotin studies, an anti -CD30 -vc-MMAE ADC 
(see Section 3.4.2 ),peripheral neuropathy (sensory and motor) has been identified as a 
known risk (adverse drug reaction) for both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.
Careful clinical evaluation of patients for neuropathy should be conducted prior to 
initiation of study drug . Patients should be monitored for signs of peripher al neuropathy 
or worsening neuropathy and appropriate action taken per protocol guidelines.  Study 
treatment dose and schedule modifications for significant and prolonged neuropathic 
toxicity and dose -reduction are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reproduct ive Toxicity
Adverse effects on human reproduction and fertility are anticipated with the 
administration of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, given the mechanism of action of 
MMAE.  Standard exclusion criteria will be used to ensure that patients of childbearing 
potential (male or female) are using adequate contraceptive methods. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A as well as with other ADCs using the same vc -MMAE platform.  Several 
patients given both DCDT 2980S and DCDS4501A had abnormal fasting blood sugar 
(FBS) at screening with elevations of glucose following steroid administration prior to 
rituximab dose. Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing 
treatment of the ADCs and/or init iation or adjustment of anti-hyperglycemic medications.   
Emerging data suggest that hyperglycemia may occur more commonly in individuals 
with abnormal FBS values or known diabetes.  This is also reported for ADCETRIS 
(2013 SmPC and 2013 USPI).
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity
Elevations in transaminase and/or bilirubin levels requiring dose modifications and 
treatment discontinuations have been reported in the ongoing clinical studies.   
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
75/Protocol GO27834 , Version A43.4.3.9 Commonly Reported Side Effects
Other commonly reported side effects of both DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A in the 
Phase I clinical trials and within this study include fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, 
vomiting, hair thinning or loss, joint pains, loss of appetite, diarrhea, muscle aches, 
constipation, increases in blood glucose, and h eadaches.
3.4.4 Risks A ssociated with Rituximab Therapy  and Their 
Management
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reactions
In single -agent clinical trials of rituximab and in post -marketing surveillance studies, m ild
to moderate infusion reactions consisting of fever and chills/rigors occ urred in the 
majority of patients during the first rituximab infusion.  Other frequent infusion reaction 
signs and symptoms included nausea, pruritus, angioedema, asthenia, hypotension, 
headache, bronchospasm, throat irritation, rhinitis, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, 
dizziness, and hypertension.  These reactions generally occurred within 30 120minutes 
of beginning the first infusion, and they resolved with slowing or interruption of the 
rituximab infusion and with supportive care (diphenhydramine, 
acetaminophen/paracetamol, IV saline, meperidine, and vasopressors).  The incidence 
of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion and decreased with each 
subsequent infusion.
Rituximab has caused severe infusion reactions.  In some cases, thes e reactions were 
fatal.  These severe reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_766125] a time to 
onset of 30 120minutes.  Signs and symptoms of severe infusion reactions may include 
urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, or bronchospasm a ndmay require 
interruption of rituximab administration.  The most severe manifestations and sequelae 
include pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myocardial infarction, 
ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and anaphylactic a nd anaphylactoid events 
(see Appendix D).  Approximately 80% of fatal infusion reactions occurred in association 
with the first infusion of rituximab.  Because of this, patients should receive 
premedication with acetaminophen/paracetamol, antihistamines, or corticosteroids, in 
accordance with standard clinical practice, prior to rituximab infusions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Severe Infusion Reactions
Administration of rituximab will occur in a setting with emergency equipment and staff
who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  T herituximab 
infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions on the basis of clinical judgment.  
Medications and supportive care measures including, but not limited to, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
antihistamines, glucocorticoids, IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators and
acetaminophen/paracetamol should be available for immediate use and instituted as 
medically indicated for use in the event of a reaction during administration.  
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
76/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Inmost cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate ( e.g., from
100mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved.  Patients requiring 
close monitoring during all rituximab infusions include those with preexisting cardiac and 
pulmonar y conditions, those with prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary adverse 
events, and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells ( 25,000/ L) with or 
without evidence of high tumor burden.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome
Rapid reductions in tumor vol ume followed by [CONTACT_22702], hyperkalemia, 
hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hyperphosphatemia have been reported within 
1224hours after the first infusion of rituximab.  Rare instances of fatal outcome have 
been reported in the setting of TLS following treatment with rituximab.  Therisks of TLS 
appear to be greater in patients with high tumor burden.  Patients deemed to be at high 
risk for TLS complications may ,attheinvestigator’s discretion ,receive their initial dose 
of rituximab over 2 consecutive days (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Correction of electrolyte 
abnormalities, monitoring of renal function and fluid balance, and administration of 
supportive care, including di alysis, should be initiated as indicated.  Following complete 
resolution of TLS complications, rituximab has been tolerated when re -administered in
conjunction with prophylactic therapy for TLS in a limited number of cases.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatitis B Reactivation w ith Re lated Fulminant Hepatitis and 
Other Viral Infections
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death 
has been reported for some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with 
rituximab.  The majority of these patients received rituximab in combination with 
chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately 
4months after the initiation of rituximab and approximately [ADDRESS_1050581] dose 
ofrituximab.  Patients with serologic f indings consistent with chronic HBV ( hepatitis B 
surface antigen [HBsAg] positivity) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (HCV RNA or 
antibody positivity) are ineligible for this study.  Patients who are not chronically infected 
with HBV but have serologic evidence of prior infection at baseline (IgG hepatitis B core 
antibody[ anti-HBc]positive but HBV DNA negative) may be eligible (if believed to be in 
the patient’s best interest by [CONTACT_26791]) and would be 
monitored closely for perturbations in liver function during the period of rituximab 
treatment and every 2 4weeks thereafter.  Such patients would also be required to 
receive prophylactic anti -viral therapy with lamivudine for at least 6 months after 
completion of rituximab th erapy ( Yeoetal. 2009).
Additional serious viral infections, new, reactivated, or exacerbated ( e.g., infections 
caused by [CONTACT_27912], varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, 
parvovirus B19, John Cunningha m [JC]virus, and HCV) have been reported with 
rituximab, mainly in patients who had received rituximab in combination with 
chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Particular attention 
should be given to patients who have had sign ificant prior immunosuppressive treatment 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
77/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4such as high -dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.  JC virus infection resulting in 
PML and death has been observed in rituximab -treated patients with hematologic 
malignancies or with autoimmune diseases.  Mo st cases o f progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML)were diagnosed within 12 months of the patient’s last 
infusion of rituximab.  Physicians should consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient 
presenting with new -onset neurologic manifestations.  Evaluation of PML includes, but is 
not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , 
and lumbar puncture.  Physicians should discontinue rituximab (and DCDT2980S and/or 
DCDS4501A) and consider discontinuation or reduction of any immunosuppressive 
therapy in patients who develop PML.
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiovascular Events
Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious or life -threatening cardiac 
arrhythmias.  Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo
cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of rituximab.  Patients with 
preexisting cardiac conditions, including arrhythmias and angina ,who have had 
recurrences of these events during rituximab therapy should be monitored throughout
the infusion and the immediate post -infusion period.
[IP_ADDRESS] Bow el Obstruction and Perforation
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation, in some cases leading to death, 
were observed in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for 
DLBCL.  In post -marketing reports, which include patients with low -grade or follicular 
NHL and patients with DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days
(range, 177days ) in patients with documented gastrointestinal perforation.  Complaints 
of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a thorough 
diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunization
The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not 
been studied.  Patien ts who participate in this study may not receive either primary or 
booster with live virus vaccines for at least 28 days prior to initiation of rituximab or at 
any time during study treatment.  Investigators should review the status of potential 
study pati ents being considered for this study and follow the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention guidelines for adult with non -live vaccines intended to prevent 
infectious diseases prior to study therapy.
Refer to the Rituxan/MabThera(Rituximab ) Package Insert/ Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC )for additional safety information.
3.4.5 Risks A ssociated with Obinutuzumab Therapy
No evidence available at the time of the approval of this protocol indicates that special 
warnings or precautions are appropriate other than those noted in the Obinutuzumab 
Investigator’s Brochure and as described in the following sections.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
78/Protocol GO27834 , Version A43.4.5.1 Infusion -Related Reactions and Hy persensitivity Reactions 
(including A naphylaxis)
The commonly experienced IRRs have been characterized by [CONTACT_411], chills, flushing, 
nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, fatigue, and other symptoms.
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_570590] -related symptoms, such as hypoxia, dyspnea, bronchospasm, 
larynx and throat irritation, and laryngeal edema, have also been reported.  These IRRs 
were mostly mild or moderate (NCI CTCAE v 4.0, Grade 1 and 2events), and 10% of 
the events were severe (Grade 3 events), occurring predominantly during the first hour 
of the infusion or shortly after the first infusion had finished.  The events resolved with 
the slowing or interruption of the infusion and supportive care.  The incidence and 
severity of IRRs decreased with subsequent infusions.  Extensive tumor burden 
predominantly localized in the blood circulat ion (e.g., high peripheral lymphocyte count in 
patients with CLL) may be a predisposing factor for the development of IRRs.
IRRs may be clinically indistinguishable from IgE- mediated allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome
TLS has been rep orted with obinutuzumab administration.  Patients with a high tumor 
burden, including patients with a lymphocyte count 25109/L, particularly patients with 
B-cell CLL and MCL , are at increased risk for TLS and severe IRRs.   All patients with 
peripheral blood lymphocyte counts of 25109/L or bulky adenopathy must receive 
prophylaxis for TLS prior to the initiation of study treatment.  This includes appropriate 
hydration, consisting of fluid intake of approximately 3 L/day, starting 1 2days prior to 
the first dose of obinutuzumab, and administration of allopurinol (300 mg/day orally) or a 
suitable alternative (i.e., rasburicase) treatment, starting at least 1224hours prior to 
the first infusion of obinutuzumab (Cycle 1, Day 1).  All patients should then be carefully 
monitored during the initial weeks of treatment.  Patients still considered at risk for TLS 
because of persistently high tumor burden (i.e., peripheral blood lymphocyte counts 
25109/L) before the second and subsequen t infusions of obinutuzumab should 
receive continuous TLS prophylaxis with allopurinol or a suitable alternative (i.e., 
rasburicase) and adequate hydration until the risk is abated , as determined by [CONTACT_1275]. For treatment of TLS, correct electrol yte abnormalities, monitor renal 
function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as 
indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia
Cases of Grade [ADDRESS_1050582] Grade 2.  Use of G -CSF 
has been found to result in a rapid normalization of neutrophils, similar to what has been 
observed in patients treated with rituximab.  The use of G -CSF is allowed for treatmen t 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
79/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4of neutropenia in this study.  Primary prophylaxis with G -CSF is recommended 
according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ),European Organisation 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ), and European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, namely for patients who are 60years old and/or with 
co-morbidities ( Lyman et al. 2004 ).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia
Severe and life -threatening thrombocytopenia, including acute thrombocytopenia 
(occurring within 24 hours after the infusion), has been observed during treatment with 
obinutuzumab.  Fatal hemorrhagic events have also been reported in patients treated 
with obinutuzumab.  It seems that the first cycle is the greatest risk of hemorrhage in 
patients treated with obinutuzumab.  A clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and 
hemorrhagic events has not been established.  Patients treated with concomitant 
medication, which could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia -related events (e.g., platelet 
inhibitors and anticoagulants), may be at greater risk of bleeding.  Patients should be 
closely monitored for thrombocytopenia, especially during the first cycle; regular 
laboratory tests should be performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be 
considered in case of severe or life -threatening thrombocytopenia.  Transfusion of blood 
products (i.e., platelet transfusion) according to institutional practice is at the discretion 
of the treating physician. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infection
On the basis of its anticipated mode of action, resulting in profound B -cell depletion, 
obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections.  Infections have 
been reported in patients receiving obinutuzumab.  Therefore, obinutuzumab should not 
be administered to patients with active severe infections.
A “black -box” warning for obinutuzumab states that r eactivation of hepatitis B as well as 
other serious viral infections (e.g .,infections caused by [CONTACT_27912], Varicella zoster 
virus, herpes simplex virus, JC virus, and HCV) that were new, reactivated, or 
exacerbated have been reported with the B celldepleting antibody rituximab mainly in 
patients who had received the drug in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a 
hematopoietic SCT.  T he risk of such infections with obinutuzumab is unknown.  
Particular attention should be given to patients who have previously received significant 
immunosuppressive treatment, such as high -dose chemotherapy and SCT.
A “black -box” warning for obinutuzumab states that JC viral infection (including fatal) that 
resulted in PML with destructive infection of oligodendrocytes of the CNS wh ite matte
have been reported in patients treated with anti -CD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including rituximab and 
obinutuzumab.
The diagnosis of PML should be considered in any patient presenting with new -onset 
neurologic manifestations.  The symptoms of PML are unspecific and can vary 
depending on the affected region of the brain.  Motor involvement with corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_766126]2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
80/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4findings, sensory i nvolvement, cerebellar deficits, and visual field defects are common.  
Some syndromes regarded as cortical (e.g., aphasia or visual -spatial disorientation) 
canoccur.
Evaluation of PML includes ,but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain
MRI, and lumbar puncture (cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_570591]). 
Therapy with obinutuzumab should be withheld during the investigation of potential PML 
and permanently discontinued in case of confirmed PML.  Discontinuation or reduction of 
any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should also be 
considered.  The patient should be referred to a neurologist for the diagnosis and 
management of PML.
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunization
The safety of immunization with live virus vaccines following obinutuzumab therapy has 
not been studied.  Thus, vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended during 
treatment and until B -cell recovery.
[IP_ADDRESS] Worsening of Preexisting Cardiac Condition
In patients with underlying cardiac disease and treated with obinutuzumab, adverse 
events such as angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, heart 
failure, and arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmia, have been 
observed.  These events may occur as part of an IRR and can be fatal.  Ther efore, 
patients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely.  In addition, these 
patients should be hydrated with caution to prevent a potential fluid overload.
3.5 MINIMIZA TION OF BIA S
For the randomized, non -comparative, open -label portion of the study , patients were
randomly allocated to two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio through use of an interactive 
voice or web -based response system (IxRS).  A dynamic stratified randomization 
scheme wasemployed to ensure balance in the stratification fa ctors as specified in 
Section 3.1.  This portion of the study (Arms A and B) is now closed to enrollment .

DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
86/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Additional information/instructions regarding study drug administration will be provided in 
the Pharmacy Binder.
c.General Information
The total dose of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A for each patient will depend on the 
patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day1 of each cycle.  The patient weight 
obtained during screening may be used for dose determination at all treatment cycle s; if 
the patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day1 of a given treatment cycle differs 
by >10% from the weight obtained during screening, the new weight should be used to 
calculate the dose.
For both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, the initial dose will be administered to
well-hydrated (based on clinical judgment) patients over 90 (10)minutes.  
Prem edication with acetaminophen or paracetamol (e.g., 5001000 mg) and 
diphenhydramine (e.g., 50C100mg) per institutional standard practice may be 
administered prior to each infusion.  Administration of corticosteroids is permitted at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  Patients who do not receive prem edications prior to 
the first dose of DCDT 2980S and who develop an IRRduring the first dose should 
receive prem edications prior to subsequent doses (see Table 1 ).
The DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A infusion may be slowed or interrupted for patients 
experiencing infusion -associated symptoms.  Following the i nitial dose, patients will be 
observed for 90 minutes for fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, nausea, or other 
infusion- associated symptoms.  If the infusion is well -tolerated, subsequent doses of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A may be administered over 30 (10)minu tes, followed by a 
30-minute observation period post -infusion.  
Forinstructions on study drug preparation and administration, refer to the DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification
Patients should be assessed clinically for toxic ity prior to each dose using the 
NCICTCAE v4.0 grading scale.  Dosing will occur only if a patient’s clinical assessment 
and laboratory test values are acceptable.  Ifscheduled dosing coincides with a holiday 
that precludes dosing, dosing should commence on the nearest following date, with 
subsequent dosing continuing on a 21 -dayschedule as applicable.
Specific guidelines around dosage modifications for neutropenia and peripheral 
neuropathy are detailed below in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Patients who 
experience other treatment -related Grade 3 or4 toxicity or laboratory abnormalities will 
be allowed to delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab or 
obinutuzumab ) for up to 2weeks to allow for recovery.  Patients may continue to receive 
additional infusions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A per their treatment assignment 
provided that the toxicity has resolved to Grade 2 or 80% of the baseline value, 
 
DCDT2980S  and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.  
87/Protocol GO27834, Version A4 whichever is lower , within the 2− week delay period.  The decision for dose modification 
will be made on the basis of  the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit 
with continued study treatment and in consultation with the Medical Monitor.   
Once dose reductions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A are made for toxicity , dose 
re-escalation will not be allowed.    
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A , requiring its 
discontinuation, single-agent rituximab may be continued on the basis of  the 
investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit and with the approval of the 
Medical  Monitor.   Patients enrolled in obinutuzumab-containing cohorts will not continue 
on single-agent obinutuzumab unless approved by [CONTACT_1689] . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved to Grade ≤ 2 or ≥ 80% of baseline value, 
whichever is lower, may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks .  Dosing of 
both DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab should be held during 
this period.  If all study drug− related toxicities have resolved sufficiently, the patient may 
resume DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab dosing on the 
regular every -21-day schedule.   
A patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day  cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_570667] a patient’s dosing regimen from 21-day  to 28-day  cycles would provide 
sufficient time for recovery from a transient and reversible toxicity for example, 
cytopenia without requiring repeated treatment delays.  Modifications to the dosing 
schedule in this fashion must be made in consultation with and with the approval of the 
Medical Monitor.  
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for continuation of dosing after the 2-week delay may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes ( see 
Section 4.5.6).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed 
following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by 
[CONTACT_766231].  
Specific guidelines around schedule modifications for neutropenia and peripheral 
neuropathy are detailed below in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reaction 
Patients will be monitored during and after each DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A infusion for 
[ADDRESS_1050589] infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions in the 
absence of infusion-related adverse events.  Patients who experience infusion-related symptoms should be managed as des cribed in Table 1 .  Precautions for suspected 
anaphylactic reaction during study drug infusions are provided in Appendix  D.

90/Protocol GO27834 , Version A44.3.1.6 Neutropenia
Because neutropenia is a known risk of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501 A 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the use of growth factor support (G -CSF) as prophylactic and 
therapeutic indications is permitted (see Appendix F) in order to allow continued dosing 
of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A.  Dose modifications for patients who experience 
treatment -related Grade 34 neutropenia in the context of G -CSF usage are as follows:
Primary prophylaxis with G -CSF (i.e.,prior to the first dose of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A) is permitted for patients with clinical factors listed in 
Appendix For who otherwise are considered at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_766128].
Patients who experience treatment -related Grade 34 neutropenia will be allowed to 
delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab or obinutuzumab ) for up to 
twoweeks to allow for recovery.  Therapeutic G -CSF is permitted as clinically 
indicated (see Appendix F) and to facilitate neutrophil recovery to allow subsequent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dosing .
Subsequent dosing of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A and rituximab/obinutuzuma b is 
permitted provided that the neutropenia has resolved to Grade 2 or 80% of the 
baseline value, whichever is lower, within the 2 -week period.  
If prophylactic G -CSF was not adminis tered prior to the cycle in which the 
Grade 34 neutropenia developed, then prophylactic G -CSF may be administered 
prior to subsequent cycles without DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose reduction.  The 
dose schedule may be changed from 21-dayto 28 -daycycles to prov ide sufficient 
time for neutrophil recovery in subsequent cycles.  In the absence of prophylactic 
G-CSF or dose schedule modification, the dose of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A in 
subsequent cycles should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg for Arms A and B .  For Cohorts 
E, G,and H, patients will be giv en DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg ,andfurther 
dose reductions cannot be made .  
If Grade 34 neutropenia recurs with prophylactic G -CSF, the dose for subsequent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg for Arms A an d B.  
Prophylactic G -CSF and dose schedule modifications as described above are 
permitted in order to maintain the reduced DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose level and 
schedule.
If Grade 34 neutropenia recurs at the reduced dose despi[INVESTIGATOR_766129] G -CSF, then the patient should be discontinued from study treatment.  
For patients enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohort sC and D,
as well as Cohorts E, G ,and H ), dose reductions will not be allowed for neutropenia.  
Admini stration of therapeutic/prophylactic G -CSF and dose -schedule modifications 
as described above are allowed.  Patients who have persistent or recurrent 
Grade 34 neutropenia as defined above should be discontinued from study 
treatment.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
91/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4The determination of the dose and schedule modifications will be made on the basis of
the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continuing study treatment 
and with the approval of the Medical Monitor.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Neuropathy
Peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) is a known risk of DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A ( seeSection [IP_ADDRESS] ).  For new or worsening drug -related Grade 2 or3 
peripheral sensory and/or moto r neuropathy, dosing should be held for up to 2 weeks
until peripheral neuropathy improves to Grade 1 or baseline grade.  Continuation of 
study treatment following dose delays beyond 2 weeks will require consultation with and 
approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment of the benefit -riskanalysis of 
continuing to delay study treatment.
For patients enrolled inarms A or B f ollowing resolution of peripheral neuropathy
(sensory and/or motor) , subsequent doses of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A s hould be 
reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.  If worsening Grade 2 or3 peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or 
motor) recurs following dose reduction, study treatment should be discontinued.  For 
Grade 4peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), study treatment should be 
discontinued. 
Forpatients enrolled into Cohorts C and D ,dose modifications will n ot be allowed.  
Patients who have Grade 2 or3 peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), as 
defined above ,should be discontinued from study treatment.   
For patients enrolled inCohorts E, G, or H, following resolution of Grade 2 or Grade 3 
peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), subsequent doses of DCDS4501A should 
be permanently reduced from 1.8 mg/kg to 1.4 mg/kg.  If worsening Grade 2 or Grade 3 
peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) recurs following dose reduction, study 
treatment should be discontinued.  For Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or 
motor), study treatment should be discontinued.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia
Hyperglycemia has been observe d in patients treated with DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A as wel l as with other ADCs using the same vc -MMAE platform.  
Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs 
and/or initiation of improved anti -hyperglycemic medications ( seeSection [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
For symptomatic fasti ng Grade 3 (250 500mg/dL) or asymptomatic Grade 4 
(500mg/dL) hyperglycemia, medical management should be initiated immediately and 
consultation with a specialist should be considered.  If the hyperglycemia persists for 
1week after initiation of management, dose modification, sc hedule modification ,or 
discontinuation of study treatment should be considered.  In these cases, the study 
Medical Monitor should be consult ed to assess the benefit -riskbalance of continued 
study treatment.

92/Protocol GO27834 , Version A44.3.2 Rituximab
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation
Rituximab (Rituxan®/MabTh era®) is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative -free liquid 
concentrate for IV administration.  Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL 
in 500- mg (50 -mL) single -use vials.  A single -unit, 500 -mg carton contains one 50- mL 
vial of rituximab ( 10 mg/mL).  The product is formulated for IV administration in 
9.0mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, and 0.7 mg/mL 
polysorbate 80, after reconstitution with SWFI.  The pH is adjusted to 6.5.  Vials are for 
single use.  Each vial a ndcarton will contain a label (either single- panel or booklet) 
affixed to the vial or carton.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, A dministration, and Storage
Rituximab (Rituxan®, MabThera®)will be administered intravenously once per 3-week 
(or4-week) cycle.  The infusion at 375mg/m2for each dose will be based on the 
patient’s body surface area at screening and will remain the same throughout the study.  
If a scheduled dose of rituximab falls outside of the 2-daywindow for reasons other 
than an adverse event, the site mu st notify and have a discuss ionwith the Genentech 
Medical Monitor prior to rituximab administration.  Such dosing may not necessarily 
qualify as a protocol deviation, if deemed to be in the best interests of the patient, after 
consultation with the Medica l Monitor and agreed to in advance by [CONTACT_1689]. 
Rituximab should not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  Infusion reactions may 
occur.  Premedication consisting of acetaminophen (or paracetamol), diphenhydramine 
(or other suitable antihist amine), and a single dose of hydrocortisone (e.g., up to 100 mg 
or an equivalent dose of methylprednisolone) may also be administered beginning with 
the first infusion, per standard clinical practice.  Premedication may attenuate infusion 
reactions.  Becau se transient hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, 
consideration should be given to withholding antihypertensive medications for [ADDRESS_1050592] Infusion
The rituximab solution for infusion should be administered intravenously at an initial rate 
of 50mg/hr.  Rituximab should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs.  If infusion 
reactions do not occur, the infusion rate should be escalated in 50 mg/hr increments 
every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If aninfusion reaction develops, 
theinfusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted.  The infusion can continue at 
one-half the previous rate upon improvement of patient symptoms.  
b.Subsequent Infusions
If the patient tolerates the first infusion well, subsequent rituximab infusions may be 
administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr and increased in 100 mg/hr increments at 
30-minute intervals to a maximum of 400 mg/hr, as tolerated.  If the patient does not 
tolerate the first infusion well, the guideli nes for the first infusion should be followed.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
93/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4If a patient tolerates the first three cycles of study treatment without significant infusion 
reactions, rituximab may be administered as “rapid infusion” in accordance with local 
institutional guidelines.
c.Storage
Rituximab vials must be stored at 2 C8C (36 C46F).  Rituximab vials should be 
stored in the outer carton in order to protect them from light.  Rituximab solution for 
infusion may be stored at 2 C8C (36 C46F) for 24 hours and has been shown to be 
stable for an additional 12 hours at room temperature.  However, because rituximab 
does not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be stored refrigerated 
(2C8C).  No incompatibilities between rituximab and PVC or poly ethylene (PE) bags 
have been observed.
See the Rituxan® (Rituximab) Package Insert or SmPC (in the E uropean Union ) for 
additional information.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification
There will be no rituximab dose modification in this study.  Pat ients at high risk for 
TLS complications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive 
their initial dose of rituximab over 2 consecutive days (e.g., 125mg/m2on Day1, 
250mg/m2on Day2; with DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose potentially delayed to Day3).
Any NCI CTCAE (v4.0)toxicity Grade 3 in severity that is deemed related to rituximab 
treatment will require interruption of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab) until 
resolution to Grade 2 or 80% of baseline, whichever is lower.  Resumption of 
rituximab treatment may be considered in patients with resolution of toxicities to 
Grade 1 within 2 weeks at the discretion of the investigator, after consultation with the 
Medical Monito r.  Failure of such toxicities to resolve after 2 -week delay in study 
treatment will require permanent discontinuation of rituximab.  Continuation of rituximab 
treatment may be permitted on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit following a careful 
assessme nt and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766232].  
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to rituximab requiring its discontinuation, 
single -agent DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be contin ued on the basis of the 
investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit and with the approval of the Medical 
Monitor.
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved (i.e., to Grade 1 or 80% of  baseline) 
may have their study t reatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks .  If after the up to 2-week 
delay ,all study drug related toxicities have resolved sufficiently, the patient may receive 
the scheduled doses of rituximab.  In addition, a patient’s dosing may be changed to a 
28-daycycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_766233] a patient’s

(seeSection 4.5.1 ).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed 
followi ng a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by 
[CONTACT_766224].  In addition, delay of therapy 
because of toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation and will 
be discussed with the Medical Monitor.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reaction
Patients will be monitored during and after each rituximab infusion for [ADDRESS_1050594] infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions in the absence of 
infusion- related adver se events.  Patients who experience infusion -related symptoms 
should be managed as directe d inTable 1 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
In the event of a life -threatening IRR (which may include pulmonary or cardiac events) or 
IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction to ri tuximab, rituximab should be discontinued and 
no additional rituximab should be administered.  Patients who experience these 
reactions should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment and should be discontinued 
from study treatment.
4.3.3 Obinutuzumab
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation
Obinutuzumab (GA101/Gazyva /Gazyvaro) is a clear, colorless to slightly brownish 
liquid, provided as a single 1000 -mg dose liquid concentrate with a strength of 
25mg/mL.  It is supplied in 50 mL glass vials containing 40 mL of the 25mg/mL liquid 
concentrate.  In addition to the antibody, the liquid also contains histidine/histidine -HCl, 
trehalose, poloxamer 188, and highly purified water (HP W).
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, Administration ,and Storage
Obinutuzumab will be administered by [CONTACT_27920] (fla t) dose of 1000 mg 
in combination with DCDS4501A, as outlined in Section 3.1.3 .  Obinutuzumab will be 
administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 8(see Table 2 ).  
No dose modifications of obinutuzumab are allowed.
All obinutuzuma b infusions should be administered after premedication with oral 
acetaminophen and an antihistamine (see Section 4.4.1 ).  The prophylactic use of 
corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent) may also be considered 
for patients thought to be at high risk for IRRs ,if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093] ,
and should be administered prior to the obinutuzumab infusion.  On Cycle [ADDRESS_1050595] 60minutes prior to the obinutuzumab infusion.  
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
95/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Premedication with prednisone or prednisolone is mandatory in patients who had an IRR 
and should continue until IRRs no longer occur during antibody infusion.  For the 
management of IRRs and anaphylaxis, see Table 1 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
If it is the strong preference of the investigator or of the site (e.g., for logistical reasons) 
or if the patient is at increased risk for an IRR (high tumor burden, high peripheral 
lymphocyte count ), the administration of obinutuzumab infusion can be split over [ADDRESS_1050596] Infusion (Cy cle 1 Day 1) Subsequent Infusions
Begin infusion at an initial rate of 50mg/hr.
If no infusion -related or hypersensitivity 
reaction occurs, increase the infusion rate in 
50-mg/hour increments every 30 minutes to a 
maximum of 400 mg/hr.
If a reaction develops, stop or slow the 
infusion.  A dminister medications and 
supportive care in accordance with 
institutional guidelines.  If reaction has 
resolved, resume the infusion at a 
50% reduction in rate (i.e., 50% of rate used 
at the time the reaction occurred).If the patient experienced an infus ion-related 
or hypersensitivity reaction during the prior 
infusion, use full premedication including 
100mg prednisone/prednisolone (until no 
further IRRoccurs), begin infusion at an 
initial rate of 50 mg/hr, and follow instructions 
for first infusion.
Ifthe patient tolerated the prior infusion well 
(defined by [CONTACT_570644] 2 reactions 
during a final infusion rate of 100mg/hr), 
begin infusion at a rate of 100 mg/hr.
If no reaction occurs, increase the infusion 
rate in 100 -mg/hour increments every 
30minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.
If a reaction develops, stop or slow the 
infusion.  Administer medications and 
supportive care in accordance with 
institutional guidelines.  If reaction has 
resolved, resume the infusion at a 
50% reduction in rate (i.e ., 50% of rate used 
at the time the reaction occurred).
IRRinfusion -related reaction.
In all parts of the study, obinutuzumab must be administered in a clinical (inpatient or 
outpatient) setting.  Full emergency resuscitation facilities should be immediately 
available ,and patients should be under the close supervision of the investigator at all 
times.  For the management of IRRs and anaphylaxis, see Table 1 (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Obinutuzumab should be administered as a slow IV infusion through a dedi cated line.  
IVinfusion pumps should be used to control the infusion rate of obinutuzumab .  Do not 
administer as an IV push or bolus.  Administration sets with PVC, polyurethane ( PUR) , 
or PE as a product contact [CONTACT_26778] (PO), polypropylene ( PP), 
PVC, or PE as a product contact [CONTACT_570642].  Do not use 
an additional in -line filter because of potential adsorption.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
96/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4The recommended storage conditions for obinutuzumab drug product are between 2 °C 
and 8° C, protected from light.  For clinical formulation -specific and batch -specific 
instructions and information on in -use sta bility, see the packaging label.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification
There will be no obinutuzumab dose modification in this study.  Patients at high risk for 
TLS complications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive 
obinutuzumab over 2 consecutive days (with DCDS4501A dose potentially delayed to 
Day2 or Day3).
Any NCI CTCAE (v4.0) toxicity Grade 3 in severity that is de emed related to 
obinutuzumab treatment will require interruption of study treatment (both DCDS4501A 
and obinutuzumab ) until resolution to Grade 2 or 80% of baseline, whichever is lower.  
Resumption of obinutuzumab treatment may be considered in patient s with resolution of 
toxicities to Grade 1 within 2 weeks at the discretion of the investigator, 
afterconsultation with the Medical Monitor.  Failure of such toxicities to resolve after 
2-week delay in study treatment will require permanent discontinuat ion of obinutuzumab .  
Continuation of study treatment following dose delays beyond 2 weeks will require 
consultation with and approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment of the 
benefit -risk analysis of continuing to delay study treatment.
If a patient deve lops unacceptable toxicity to obinutuzumab requiring its discontinuation, 
single -agent DCDS4501A will not be permitted.
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved (i.e., to Grade 1 or 80% of  baseline) 
may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks .  Dosing of both DCDS4501A 
and obinutuzumab should be held during this period.  Ifall study drug related toxicities 
have resolved to Grade 1or80% of baseline, the patient may resume DCDS4501A 
and obinut uzumab dosing on the regular every 21day schedule.  In addition, a 
patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28 -daycycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_766234] a patient’s dosing regimen from [ADDRESS_1050597] 
elapsed may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for sa fety outcomes 
(see Section 4.5.6 ).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed 
following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by 
[CONTACT_766224].  In add ition, delay of therapy 
because of toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation and will 
be discussed with the Medical Monitor.

97/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Specific guidelines around schedule modifications for thrombocytopenia and febrile 
neutropenia are detailed below in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia is a known risk of obinutuzumab (seeSection [IP_ADDRESS] ).  If the clinical 
condition of a patient requires the use of concomitant anticoagulants, the patient is at 
increas ed risk of bleeding when the platelet count is 20,000/ L.  W hen possible, 
replace prior therapy withVitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin , with low-molecular 
weight heparin ( LMWH)or new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) before Cycle 1 Day1.  
Clinical decision making may be adjusted depending on the patient -specific assessment 
of benefit and risk.
In the event of severe thrombocyt openia (platelet count 10,000/ L) and/or symptomatic 
bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who a re not receiving concomitant 
anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors :
Hold obinutuzumab until thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding resolves .  If 
Cycle 1 Day 8 is delayed, then skip Day 8 and administer Day 15 as previously 
scheduled (if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding has resolved).  If Cycle 1 
Day 15 is delayed, then skip Day 15 dosing and administer Cycle 2 Day 1 of 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A as scheduled (if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic 
bleeding has resolved).
In the event of thrombocytop enia with platelet count 20,000/ L and/or symptomatic 
bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who are receiving concom itant 
anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors :
Hold obinutuzumab until thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding resolves . If 
Cycle 1 Day 8 is delayed, then ski p Day 8 and administer Day 15 as previously 
scheduled (if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding has resolved).  If Cycle 1 
Day 15 is delayed, then skip Day 15 dosing and administer Cycle 2 Day 1 of 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A as scheduled (if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic 
bleeding has resolved).
For patients who are on LM WHor NOACs , when platelet count 20,000/ L 
develops , reduce the dose of LM WH or NOACs used.
For patients who are on platelet inhibitors when throm bocytopenia with platelet 
count 20,000/ L develops , consideration should be given to temporarily paus ing
the useof platelet inhibitors .
[IP_ADDRESS] Febrile Neutropenia  
In the event of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia with infection, hold obinutuzumab until 
febrile neutropenia or neutropenia with infection resolves.  
If Cycle 1 Day 8 is delayed long enough that the patient is approaching Day 15, then 
skip Day 8 and administer Day 15 as previously scheduled (if infection or fever has 
resolved)

[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram Assessments
Twelve-lead digital ECG measurements will be obtained in triplicate, with immediately 
consecutive ECGs obtained until three e valuable ECGs are recorded, at the following 
timepoints:
Screening
3060 minutes before the start of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in Cycle 1
3060 minutes after the completion of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in 
Cycle 1
3060 minutes after the completion of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in 
Cycle 3
Day8 (1day) of Cycle 3 time matched (i.e.,obtained at the same time of day )with 
post-DCDT2980s/DCDS4501A infusion ECGs for Cycle 3
Treatment completion/early termination vi sit
Non-triplicate ECGs should also be performed when clinically indicated in any patient 
with evidence of or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_766132]. 
All ECGs as described above will be submitted to a Sponsor -designated ECG central 
laboratory for storage and potential analysis.  Detailed instructions on ECG acquisitions 
and transmissions to the ECG central laboratory will be provided in the ECG manual 
provided for this study.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
103/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Representative ECGs at each timepoint should be reviewed by [CONTACT_1720] a 
qualified designee.  Post -screening ECG measurements should be obtained as close as 
possible to scheduled serum and plasma PK samples (see Appendices B-1and B-2) 
and should be no more than 30 minutes apart.  If QTc prolongation ( 500ms and 
60ms longer than the pre- dose baseline value) is noted, ECGs should be repeated 
until the prolongation is reversed or stabilized.  If a PK sample is not scheduled at the 
timepoint where QTc prolongation is first observed, then an unscheduled sample should 
be obtained.  An evaluation for potential causes of QT prolongation for 
example ,electrolyte imbalances or concomitant medications should be performed, 
study t reatment dosing held, and the Medical Monitor notified.  Management of QT/QTc 
prolongation should be performed in accordance with institutional standard of care at the 
discretion of the treating physician.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic andPharmacody namic Assessments
Pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A will be characterized by [CONTACT_766237] (conjugated and unconjugated antibody), acMMAE, and free MMAE 
concentrations using validated methods (see Section 4.9).  Plasma samples may also be 
analyzed for other potential MMAE -containing catabolites, per sponsor’s discretion.  
Pharmacokinetics of rituximab will be characterized by [CONTACT_766238] a validated method (see Section 4.9).  Pharmacokinetics of 
obinutuzumab will be characte rized by [CONTACT_766239] a validated method (see Section 4.9).These assessments will allow for further 
characterization of pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, the assessment 
of the drug interaction potential whe n they are given in combination with rituximab or 
obinutuzumab , and the investigation of potential correlations between PK parameters 
andsafety and/or activity if data allow and at the sponsor’s discretion.  
Pharmacodynamics of obinutuzumab and DCS4501A m ay be assessed by [CONTACT_766240].
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity  Assessments
The immunogenicity evaluation will utilize a risk -based strategy and tiered approach 
(Rosenberg and Worobec 2004a ,2004b , 2005 ;Koren etal. 2008) designed to detect 
and characterize all ATA responses to DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  Patient samples 
will first be screened to det ect all antibody responses toward DCDT2980S or 
DCDS4501A.  Samples that screen positive will be analyzed in a confirmatory assay 
(competitive binding with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A) to assess the specificity of the 
positive response.  Titers will be determine d for confirmed positive samples. Further 
characterization will be assessed by [CONTACT_766241]2980S or DCDS4501A to characterize whether the ATA responses are primarily to 
the mAb or the linker -drug regions of the ADC.  Positive ATA samples will be stored for 
further characterization of ATA responses, ifnecessary.  
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
104/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4The schedule of sample collection for ATA assessment is outlined in Appendices B-1,
B-2, or B-3, depending on the schedule of study treatment administration.  Samples for 
ATA will not be collected during the crossover treatment period.
ATA responses to obinutuzumab will be detected and confirmed using a similar tiered 
approach.  Patient samples will first be screened to detect all antibody responses to 
obinutuzumab.  Samples that screen positive will be analyzed in a confirmatory assay 
(competitive binding with obinutuzumab) to assess the specificity of the positive 
respon se.  The relative levels of ATA in confirmed positive samples will be determined in 
a titering assay.  Positive ATA samples will be stored for further characterization of ATA 
responses, if necessary .
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Response A ssessments
All measurable disease must b e documented at screening and re -assessed at each 
subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response assessments will be assessed by [CONTACT_1275], on the basis of physical examinations, CT scans, PET /CTscans, and/or 
MRI scans, and bone marrow examinations, using standard response c riteria for NHL 
(Cheson etal. 2007; Cheson et al. 2014 ) (see Appendix C-1and C-2).  Specific response 
assessment criteria differ between the rituximab -containing arms/cohorts and the 
obinutuzumab -containing cohorts (see Section 4.5.1.8a . and 4.5.1.8b ).
a.Radiographic A ssessments for Patients on Rituximab -Containing 
Arms/Cohorts
CT scans with contrast should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis scans; CT scans of 
theneck should be performed at screening and followed only if disease is present at 
screening.  Post-screening radiographic assessments may be limited to areas of prior 
involvement only if required by [CONTACT_766242].
MRI scans may be used instead of CT scans in patients for whom CT scans with IV 
contrast are contraindicated.  Details regarding imaging procedures in these cases will be 
provided in the Imaging Manua l.
A PET /CTscan is required during screening for all patients with DLBCL.  An additional 
PET /CTscan in patients with DLBCL should be obtained at the 6- month tumor 
assessment to ensure consistency of response assessment methodology at this 
timepoint for all patients.  PET /CTscans should additionally be obtained to confirm 
disappearance of metabolically active disease during study treatment and to confirm a 
CR upon discontinuation of study treatment.  
For patients with FL, PET /CTscans are not requi red but may be obtained on the basis 
ofphysician preference and if permitted by [CONTACT_72952].  Similar ly,for patients 
with DLBCL, PET /CTscans on patients with FL should be obtained during screening; 
for patients whose tumors are PET positive during screening, an additional PET /CT
scan should be obtained at the 6 -month tumor assessment.  PET /CTscans should 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
105/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4additionally be obtained to confirm disappearance of metabolically active disease during 
study treatment and to confirm a CR upon disconti nuation of study treatment. 
For all patients regardless of disease subtype, combined PET /CTscans may be used 
instead of CT alone if performed with contrast and if collected with resolution sufficient to 
allow accurate and consistent comparison of target lesion measurements with 
subsequent PET /CTscans.  If a PET /CTscan is to be used during screening, then 
PET /CTscans should be performed for all subsequent tumor assessments in order to 
ensure their consistency across different timepoints.
All tumor asses sments will be submitted to an IRF for storage and possible independent 
centralized review.  Details related to submission of data to the IRF will be defined in a 
separate Imaging Manual.
b.Radiographic A ssessments for P atients on Obinutuzumab -Containing 
Cohorts
PET /CTscan sshould minimally extend from skull-base to mid- thigh.  Full -body PET 
scan should be performed when clinically appropriate.
CT scans with oral and IV contrast should include chest, abdomen ,and pelvic scans; CT 
scans of the neck should be included if clinically indicated.  CT scans for response 
assessment may be limited to areas of prior involvement only if required by [CONTACT_766243].  At the investigator’s discretion, CT scans may be repeated at any time if 
progressive disease is suspected.
In patients for whom contrast is contraindicated for example, patients with contrast 
allergy or impaired renal CLCT or combined PET/CT scans without contrast are 
permitted so long as they permit consistent and pr ecise measurement of target lesions 
during the study treatment period.  
PET /CTscans are required for patients with follicu lar NHL and DLBCL at screening, 
after Cycle 4 of study treatment (i.e. ,between Cycle 4Day15 and Cycle 5Day1), and
at EOT.  The EOT response assessment should be performed 6 8weeks after Cycle [ADDRESS_1050604] scans without PET scans will be obtained every 
6months for 2years, with use of Lugano 2014 Response Criteria for NHL
(see Appendix C-
2).  
c.Bone Marrow A ssessments
A bone marrow biopsy for morphology is required at screening and should reflect 
disease status in the bone marrow following documented relapse on the last prior 
therapy or within 3 months of Day1, whichever occurs later. For 
obinutuzu mab-containing cohorts, only follicular NHL patients are required to undergo a 
bone marrow biopsy at screening. If the bone marrow biopsy at screening demonstrates 
presence of tumor cells, a subsequent bone marrow examination is required only to 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
106/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4confirm a CR or if clinically indicated.  If the bone marrow biopsy at screening does not 
demonstrate presence of tumor cells, then subsequent bone marrow examination is 
required only if clinically indicated.
d.Schedule of Tumor Response A ssessments for Rituximab- Containing 
Arms/Cohorts
Tumor response assessments will be performed every 3months (1week) from the 
initiation of study treatment until study treatment completion or early termination
(e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1050605] 
eight 21 -day cycles of treatment ).  The schedule of tumor assessments isindependent 
of the study treatment dose schedule.  For patients enrolled inrituximab- containing 
arms/cohorts, the schedule of tumor response assessments is detailed in Appendix A-1.  
As stated above, for all patients withDLBCL enrolled ina rituximab- containing 
arm/cohort , PET/CTscans are required during the screening period and at t he 6-month 
tumor assessment timepoint .
The schedule for tumor response assessments for patients who proceed to crossover 
treatment is detailed in Appendix A-2.  
Additional response assessments, after the final dose of study treatment, for patients 
who discontinue from study treatment (either initial or crossover treatment) for reasons 
other than progressive disease ,will be performed as described in Appendix A
-4. 
Tumor assessments should also be performed within [ADDRESS_1050606] study drug 
infusion (both initial and crossover treatment) at the treatment completion/early 
termination visit.  Imaging scans are not required at the treatment completion/early 
termination visit if scans have been performed within the previous [ADDRESS_1050607] a combined PET /CTscan at screening, after Cycle 4 of treatment, 
and at EOT.  The schedule for tumor response assessments for patients enrolled in 
obinutuzumab -containing cohorts is detailed in Appendix A-
3.

107/Protocol GO27834 , Version A44.5.1.9 Exploratory  Research
a.Tumor Tissue Samples
Required Tumor Tissue Sam ples
Tumor tissue samples will be used for central pathologic laboratory review of CD20, 
CD22 ,and CD79b expression.  Additional studies to fulfill the exploratory objectives in 
Section 3.3.4 will be performed, including ,but not limited ,to the following:
Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling for sign atures of NHL biology, 
including prognostic subpopulations ( Alizadeh et al. 2000 ; Wright et al. 2003), target 
expression (CD20, CD22 and CD79b) ,and apoptotic response 
Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from co res taken from provided blocks for 
immunohistochemistry ( IHC)and in situ hybridization ( ISH)assessments
forbiomarker endpoints involved in response to chemotherapy including quantitation 
of Bcl-2 protein and genetic alterations of bcl -2 including gene rearrangements, 
amplifications ,and t(14;18) translocations. Additional IHC markers may include 
those related to the tumor microenvironment.
Tumor DNA to assess mutations that have been shown to be associated with NHL 
biology and activation of the B -cell r eceptor, including mutations in CD79b 
(Pasqualucci et al. 201 1)
For patients who develop progressive disease and are eligible to receive crossover 
treatment ( see Section 3.1.8 ),a biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease will be 
performed.  Tumor tissue samples obtained at this timepoint will be used to assess 
changes in biology, target expression ,and regulators of apoptosis as described above, 
which have occurred and may be linked to progression on initial study treatment.
Optional Tumor Tissue Samples (Requires Optional Research Informed 
Consent
For patients who provide informed consent, an optional tumor biopsy will be collected at 
time of progression from the following p atients:
Patients who develop disease progression following initial study treatment and do 
not proceed to receive crossover treatment
Patients who develop disease progression on crossover treatment
Tumor tissue samples obtained at these timepoint s will be used to assess changes in 
biology, target expression, and regulators of apoptosis, as described above, that have 
occurred and may be linked to progression on treatment.
b.Blood and Plasma Samples
A plasma sample will be collected prior to treatment.
Blood samples will be taken aligned with PK sampling to assess the pharmacodynamics 
response by [CONTACT_766244].
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
108/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4For patients who sign the Optional Research Informed Consent, an additional blood 
sample will also be taken prior to treatment .
The plasma and blood samples may be used for the assessment of specific tumor 
biologic markers, including proteins, circulating DNA, and microRNAs.  The information 
obtained from these samples will enable a better understanding of the biology of NHL 
and disease prognosis, identify potential predictors of response to treatment with 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A ,rituximab ,and/or obinutuzumab , improve diagnostic 
assessments, and identify and characterize mechanisms of resistance to DCDT2980S or 
DCDS4501A and rituxi mab or obinutuzumab activit y.  
Because tumorigenesis is a multiple- step process linked to somatic events, any DNA 
analysis will focus on sporadic mutations specifically found in tumor tissue and not on 
inherited changes found in the whole body.  For this purpose, some tumor -containing 
sections may be taken from the tissue block and used for the DNA extraction process.  
Assays on stored tissue samples may be performed at Genentech or at a central 
specialty laboratory.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient -Reported Outcome s
The MDASI (Cleeland et al., 2000 ; Appendix E) is a multi -symptom self-report measure 
for clinical and research use. The MDASI’s [ADDRESS_1050608]

115/Protocol GO27834, Version A4 4.10.[ADDRESS_1050624] overall response, duration of response, and PFS will be listed for all patients.  
ORR  from the initial study treatment will be calculated on the basis of data from patients 
who received study treatment.  Objective response is defined as CR or PR as 
determined by [CONTACT_093], on the basis of physical examinations, radiographic 
scans, and bone marrow examinations, using modified response criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007; see  Appendix  C) and confirmed by [CONTACT_294862] ≥
 4 weeks  
after initial documentation.  Any patient with insufficient data to determine response will be classified as a non-responder.  
For patients  in the rituximab- containing arms/cohorts  with DLBCL, primary assessment 
of tumor response will be based on diagnostic imaging scans for example, CT and/or 
MRI scans and PET/CT  scans.  For patients with FL enrolled in the rituximab-containing 
arms/cohorts , primary assessment of response will be based on CT scans only; the 
assessment of response in patients with FL based on PET/CT  scans w ill be performed 
for exploratory purposes only. 
For patients in the obinutuzumab-containing cohorts, primary response assessment for 
patients with  DLBCL or FL will be based on PET/CT scans  using the updated 2014 
Lugano Response Criteria as determined by [CONTACT_26708] .  Patients in Cohorts E, G , and H 
will be evaluated with a PET/ CT scan at screening, between Cycle 4 Day 15 and 
Cycle  5 Day 1, and at EOT (6−8 weeks after completing treatment).  The efficacy 
analysis for  these cohorts will, therefore, be different from the analys is for Arms A −B and 
Cohorts  C−D (Cheson, et al 2014) (see  Appendix C -2).  Subsequent imaging can be CT 
only.  Responses to study treatment will also be based on investigator assessments.  
Among patients with an objective response, duration of response will be defined as the 
time from the initial documentation of a CR or PR to the time of disease progression or death.  If a patient does not experience death or disease progression before the end of the study, duration of response will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
For the randomized portion of the study (Arm s A and B), PFS is defined as the time from 
the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  If a patient has not experienced progressive disease or death, PFS will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.  Patients with no 
post-baseline tumor assessment will be censored on the date of randomization.  For the 
non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C through H ), PFS is defined as the time 
from the date of study enrollment to the date of disease progression or death from any 
cause, whichever occurs first.

4.10.7 Determination of Sample Size
For the randomized portion of the study ( Arms A and B), a target of 120 patients will be 
enrolled in two separate cohorts of patients (40 inthe follicular NHL cohort and 80 in the 
DLBCL cohort).  The randomized portion of this study is non -comparative in nature. No 
formal hypothesis testing is planned to compare the treatment arms.  Moreover, there is 
insufficient power to detect minimum clinically meaningful differences between the two 
treatment arms.  Genentech has judged th e proposed sample size to provide sufficient 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
117/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4precision in estimating the anti -tumor activity of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab or 
DCDS4501A combined with rituximab as measured by [CONTACT_33966].  For example, 
with the assumption of an observed response rate of 40%, a 90% confidence interval for 
the respons e rate would be approximately 22% 58% (i.e., 40% 18%) for the follicular 
NHL cohort and approximately 27% 53% (i.e., 40% 13%) for the DLBCL cohort.   With 
40 patients, there is an 87% chance of observing at least one adverse event with a true 
incidence of 5%.
For the non -randomized portions of the study ( Cohorts C andD),approximately 
20patients will be enrolled into each arm ,for a total of 40patients.  With 20patients 
under an observed response rate of 40%, the exact Cl opper -Pearson 90% confidence 
interval for the response rate would be 22% 61%.  With respect to the assessment of 
safety based upon a sample size of [ADDRESS_1050626] one 
adverse event with a true incidence of 10% is 88%.
For the obinutuzumab safety run -in cohort (Cohort E), 6 patients will be enrolled.  For the 
obinutuzumab expansion cohorts (Cohorts G and H), 40 patients with follicular NHL, and 
40 patients with DLBCL will be enrolled at the RP2D to further evaluate safety and 
efficacy of the combination.   Table 3 provides asymptotic 90% confidence intervals for 
the true probability of response for a range of observed proportions based upon a 
sample of 40 patients. A sample size of 40 patients is deemed sufficient to provide 
adequate precision on the point estimate and for the lower end of the 90% CI to rule out 
a clinically uninteresting rate of 45% assuming observed response rates of 
approximately 60% or higher (~24 responders observed amo ng 40 patients).

5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.[ADDRESS_1050628] of monitoring and recording protocol -defined adverse 
events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); measurement of protocol -specified 
hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; measurement of 
protocol -specified vital signs; and physical examinations and other protocol -specified 
tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug(s).
Genentech or its designee is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the Competent 
Authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in 
accorda nce with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, European Clinical Trials Directive 
(Directive 2001/20/EC), and/or local regulatory requirements.
Genentech or its designee is responsible for reporting unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening events associated with th e use of the study drug to the regulatory 
agencies and competent authorities by [CONTACT_144530] 7 calendar days after 
being notified of the event.  Genentech or its designee will report other relevant SAEs 
associated with the use of the study medic ation to the appropriate competent authorities 
(according to local guidelines), investigators, and central Institutional Review 
Board/ethics committee ( IRBs/ECs ,except in the [LOCATION_002] where investigators are 
responsible for reporting to their IRBs pe r local requirements) by a written safety report 
within 15 calendar days of notification.  
5.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an IMP or other protocol -imposed intervention, regardless of 
attribution.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
119/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4This includes the following:
AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol -specified 
AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with the baseline 
hematologic malignancy (i.e., leukem ia or lymphoma) that were not present prior to 
the AE rep orting period (see Section 5.2.1 )
Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions 
(e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies)
AEs that occur prior to assignment of study trea tment that are related to a 
protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., medication washout, no treatment run -in, or 
invasive procedures such as biopsies)
Preexisting medical conditions other than the disease under study that are judged 
by [CONTACT_766249] e worsened in severity or frequency or changed in 
character during the protocol -specified AE reporting period
5.1.2 Serious A dverse Event
An SAE is any AE that is any of the following:
Fatal (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death)
Life threatening (i.e .,the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death)
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the pati ent’s ability to conduct normal life functions)
A congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
the investigational product(s)
Considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious A Es.
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers t o the intensity of 
an AE (as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and 
is based on patient or event outcome or action criteria u sually associated with events 
that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves 
as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and 
SAEs on the eCRF. 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
120/Protocol GO27834 , Version A45.1.[ADDRESS_1050629]/Non -
Serious Expedited Adverse Events
Non-serious adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_547479] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions), irrespective of regulatory seriousness 
criteria.  Adverse events of special interest for this s tudy include the following:
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinic al jaundice, as defined by 
[CONTACT_25742]’s Law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ; treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value 
in combination with total bilirubin 2ULN [of which 35% is direct bilirubin] )
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] ,as defined below:
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) of any grade, irrespective of causality
 Second arymalignancies 
5.2 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs (as defined in 
Section 5.1) are recorded on the eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with 
protocol instructions. 
5.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period
After informed con sent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs caused by a 
protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g., SAEs related to invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run- in).
After initiation of study drug (the Genentech product [s]or other IMP), all new AEs and 
SAEs regardless of attribution will be collected until [ADDRESS_1050630] 
administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is later.  
After this pe riod, investig ators should report only SAEs that are felt to be related to prior 
study treatment with the exception of second malignancies (see Section 5.6).  Second 
malignancies will be recorded indefinitely (even if the study has ended) and irrespective 
ofnew anti -lymphoma treatment ( NALT ).
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
121/Protocol GO27834 , Version A45.2.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ents
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all patient 
evaluation timepoint s should be adopted.  Examples of non -directive questions include:
“How have you felt s ince your last clinic visit?”
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?” 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1050631].  All AEs 
and SAE s, whether reported by [CONTACT_454787], will 
be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.
For each AE and SAE recorded on the applicable eCRF, the investigator will make an 
assessment o f seri ousness (see Section 5.1.2 for seriousness criteria), severity ,and 
causality.

Note:  Regardless of severity, some events may  also meet regulatory serious criteria.  
Refer to definiti ons of an SAE (see Section 5.1.2 ).
aUse these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or 
reported AE is not in the NCI CTCAE listing.
Toensure consistency of causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guidelines:
Table 5 Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the AE/SAE suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_362241], 
evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product administration 
makes a causal relationship possible, AND other drugs, therapeutic interventions 
or underlying conditions do not provide sufficient explanation for the AE/SAE.  
NO The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product administration 
makes a causal relationship unlikely, OR other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficien t explanation for the AE/SAE.  
AE=adverse event; SAE=serious adverse event.
The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the “Yes” or “No” causality assessment for 
individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against 
cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new 
safety findings to investigators and applicable regulatory authorities .  
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
123/Protocol GO27834 , Version A45.[ADDRESS_1050633] medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or 
SAEs on the eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
There is one eCRF page for recording AEs or SAEs.
Only one medical concept should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the eCRF rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver fail ure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot 
be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, 
each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If a diagnosis 
is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary  to Other Events
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade even ts or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe diarrhea is 
known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or 
SAE on the eCRF. 
However, medically significant AEs occur ring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For 
example, if a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events 
should be recorded separately on the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pers istent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient 
evaluation timepoint s.  Such events should only be recorded once in the eCRF unless 
their severity increases.  If a persistent AE become s more severe, it should be recorded 
again on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation timepoint s 
and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on Adverse Event 
eCRF.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
124/Protocol GO27834 , Version A45.3.1.4 Abnormal Labo ratory Values
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management, 
e.g., concomitant medication, will be recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF 
(e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose modification, discontinuation of study 
treatment, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.) .
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholecy stitis), only the 
diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If the 
laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term 
should be recorded as the AE or SAE.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level 
of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”
Specific to this study, l ymphopenia and leukopenia due to lymphopenia of any grade are 
expected PD effects of study drug and therefore are not considered to be AEs.  
However, complications of lymphopenia (e.g., infections) will need to be reported as 
AEs.  In addition, be cause monocytopenia is not reportable and neutropenia is already 
being monitored and reported as an AE, leukopenia does not need to be reported as a 
distinct AE.
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF, unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE.  A vital sign result must be reported 
as an AEif it meets any of  the following criteria:
Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (including a diagnostic evaluation not mandated in 
this protocol) or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an AE.
If a clinically significant vital sign abn ormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
125/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The findi ng of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  
Therefore, investigators must report as an AEthe occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin 2ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin)
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eC RF (see Section 5.3.1 ) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a n SAE or a non -serious adverse event of spe cial interest (see 
Section 5.4.2 )
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE rep orting period (see Section5.2.1 ) 
that are attributed by [CONTACT_766250].  All other on -study deaths, regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and expeditious ly reported to 
the Sponsor.
When recording a death on an eCRF, the event or condition that caused or contributed 
to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single m edical concept on the eCRF.  
Ifthe cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
record “Unexplained Death” on the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such 
conditions should be recorded on the Medical and Surgical History eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., “more frequent headaches”).

126/Protocol GO27834 , Version A45.3.1.9 Worsening of Baseline Hematologic Malignancy
Worsening and/or progression of the baseline hematologic malignancy (e.g. leukemia or 
lymphoma) should notbe recorded as an AE or SAE.  These data will be captured as 
efficacy assessment data only.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766136].  
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766137].  These scenarios include a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647511]:
Perform an efficacy measurement for the study
Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a preexisting medical 
condition that has not changed
Receive scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy
If a female patient becomes pregnant while receiving the study drug or within 12months 
after the last dose of study treatment , a Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed 
within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy report will aut omatically be 
generated and sent to Genentech’s Drug Safety Department or its designee.  Pregnancy 
should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Male patients must also be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if their 
partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 5months after the last dose of 
study drug.  If such an event occurs, it should be reported as described below.
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should always be classified as an SAE 
(as the Sponsor considers these medically significant), recorded on an Adverse Event 
eCRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed 
tostudy drug should be classified as an SAE, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and 
expeditiously reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).
After the study period, aborti ons, congenital anomalies/birth defects, and pregnancy 
outcomes should still be reported expeditiously to the Sponsor.  
In the event the EDC system is unavailable, a paper Pregnancy Report form and 
Pregnancy Fax Coversheet should be completed and faxed to Genentech’s Drug Safety 
Department or its designee within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy, at the fax 
numbers listed in Section 5.4.2 .

enrollment in the trial but is required prior to any optional research sample collection.  
Optional consent may be withdrawn at any time by [CONTACT_941] p atient.
6.[ADDRESS_1050641] be submitted to the IRB/EC by [CONTACT_766257].  In addition, any patient 
recruitment materials must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25685]/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the regulatory 
requirements and policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Investigators are 
also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol changes or 
amendments and of any unanti cipated problems involving risk to human patients 
orothers.
In addition to the requirements to report protocol -defined AEs to the Sponsor, 
investigators are required to promptly report to their respective IRB/EC all unanticipated 
problems involving risk t o human patients.  Some IRBs/ECs may want prompt 
notification of all SAEs, whereas others require notification only about events that are 
serious, assessed to be related to study treatment, and are unexpected.  Investigators 
may receive written IND safety reports or other safety -related communications from 
Genentech.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed 
and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements and with the policies and 
procedures established by [CONTACT_11577] /EC and archived in the site’s Study File. 
6.[ADDRESS_1050642] site 
facilities and equipment, study source data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The 
Princi pal Investigator will oversee all aspects of the conduct of this protocol and permit 
Genentech monitors/representatives and collaborators, the FDA, other regulatory 
agencies, Institutional Review Boards, and the respective national or local health 
authorit ies to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.
6.6 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS
eCRFS are to be completed using the EDC 
system.  Sites will receive training for appropriate eCRF completion.  eCRFs will be 
submitted electronically to Genentech and should be handled in accordance with 
instructions from Genentech.

DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
133/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_25755], trained personnel or the study 
coordinator as appropriate.  The eCRF should be reviewed and electronical ly signed and 
dated by [CONTACT_093].
In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her 
site in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.
6.7 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study m onitors will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that critical protocol data 
(i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], 
complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents are where original patient data are recorded and documented for the 
first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, patient diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy 
dispensing records, recorded data from auto mated instruments, certified accurate and 
complete copi[INVESTIGATOR_26671], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at th e pharmacy, laboratories, and medico -technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.
Original s ource documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of 
data entered into the eCRFs must never be obliterated or destroyed.
To facilitat e SDV, the investigator(s) and institution(s) must provide the Sponsor direct 
access to all applicable source documents and reports for trial -related monitoring, 
Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow inspection 
by [CONTACT_766258].
6.8 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s 
computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), 
theelectronic record can serve as t he source document if the system has been validated 
in accordance with FDA requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in 
clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system (for clinical 
research purposes) would be one that (1) allows data entry only by [CONTACT_766259]; (2) prevents the deletion or alteration of previously entered data and 
provides an audit trail for such data changes (e.g., modification of file); (3) protects the 
database from tampering; and (4) ensures d ata preservation.
In collaboration with the study monitor, Genentech’s Quality Assurance group may assist 
in assessing whether electronic records generated from computerized medical record 
systems used at investigational sites can serve as source documents for the purposes of 
this protocol.
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.
134/Protocol GO27834 , Version A4If a site’s computerized medical record system is not adequately validated for the 
purposes of clinical research (as opposed to general clinical practice), applicable 
hardcopy source documents must be maintained to ensur e that critical protocol data 
entered into the eCRFs can be verified.
6.9 STUDY MEDICA TION A CCOUNTA BILITY
All study drug required for completion of this study will be provided by [CONTACT_8229].  
Therecipi[INVESTIGATOR_766139] a ppropriate

Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL 
Adapted from:  Cheson BD, Pfistner B, Juweid ME, et al. Revised Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma. J Clin Oncol 2007;25:579– 86. 
Selection of Indicator (Target) Lesions  
Up to six of the largest dominant nodes or tumor masses selected according to all of the 
following:  
• Clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions  
Abnormal lymph nodes are those that are either 
> [ADDRESS_1050677] transverse diameter (GTD) regardless of the short axis 
diameter, or  
> 10 mm in short axis diameter regardless of long axis  
• If possible, they should be from disparate regions of t he body . 
• Should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these 
sites are involved  
• Extranodal lesions within the liver or spleen must be at least 1.0  cm in 
two perpendicular dimensions.  
 
PET Scans --Definition of a Positive PET scan  
Visual assessment currently is considered adequate for determining whether a PET 
scan is positive, and use of the standardized uptake value is not necessary.  In brief, a positive scan is defined as focal or diffuse FDG uptake above background in a location incompatible with normal anatomy or physiology, without a specific standardized uptake value cutoff.  Other causes of false -positive scans should be ruled out.  Exceptions 
include mild and diffusely increased FDG uptake at the site of moderate or large-sized masses with an intensity that is lower than or equal to the mediastinal blood pool, hepatic or splenic nodules 1.5  cm with FDG uptake lower than the surrounding 
liver/spleen uptake, and diffusely increased bone marrow uptake within weeks  after 
treatme nt. 
Complete Remission (CR)  
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease 
and disease- related symptoms if present prior to therapy.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma: in patients with no pre -treatment PET scan or 
when the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post -treatment residual mass 
of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.  
 
Appendix  C−1 (cont.) 
Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL 
DCDT2980S  and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.  
162/Protocol GO27834, Version A4 Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, the 
designation of CR requires all nodal indicator lesions to regress to the size of 
normal lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes that were > [ADDRESS_1050678] regress to ≤ 15 mm 
in GTD regardless of the short axis diameter.  Lymph nodes that were 11 to 15 mm in GTD and >
 [ADDRESS_1050679] regress to  ≤ 10 mm in the short axis diameter.  
2. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged prior to therapy on the basis of 
a physical examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination 
and should be considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and  nodules related to 
lymphoma should disappear.  However, determination of  splenic involvement is not 
always reliable because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain 
lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood 
volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or  causes other than lymphoma.  
3. If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_248287], the infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy.  The biopsy sample on which this determination is made must be adequate (>
 20 mm unilateral core).  If  the sample is 
indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064].  A sample that is negative by [CONTACT_766264] a small 
population of clonal lymphocytes by [CONTACT_766265] a CR until data 
become available demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.  
Partial Remission (PR)  
1. ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to [ADDRESS_1050680] dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes or masses should 
be selected according to the following: (a) they should be clearly measurable in 
at least 2 perpendicular dimensions; (b) if possible they should be from disparate 
regions of the body; (c) they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.  
2. No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen.  
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥
 50% in their SPD or, 
for single  nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter.  
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present.

DCDT2980S  and DCDS4501A —Genentech, Inc.  
163/Protocol GO27834, Version A4 5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive prior to treatment.  However, if positive, the cell type should be spec ified 
(e.g.,  large -cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells).  Patients who achieve a 
complete remission by [CONTACT_86950], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial responders.  
6. No new sites of disease should be observed (e.g.,  nodes >
 1.5 cm in any axis).  
7. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the 
PET scan was positive before therapy, the post -treatment PET should be positive in 
at least one previously involved site.  
8. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment P ET/CT scan, or if a pretreatment PET /CT scan was negative, CT 
criteria should be used.  
9. In patients with follicular lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated with one or at 
most two residual masses that have regressed by [CONTACT_726] 50% on CT; those with more than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be 
considered partial responders.  
Stable Disease (SD)  
1. Failing to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but not fulfilling those 
for progressive disease (see below).  
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphomas : the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease 
with no new areas of involvement on the post - treatment CT or PET.  
3. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the previous lesions on the post -treatment CT scan.  
Relapsed Disease (RD; after CR) or Progressive Disease (PD; for Patients 
with PR or SD)  
1. Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm, regardless 
of the short axis.  If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1− 1.5 cm, it should only be 
considered abnormal if its short axis is >  1.0.  Lymph nodes ≤ 1.0 cm by ≤ 1.0 cm will 
not be considered as abnormal for relapse or  progressive disease.  
2. Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of 
therapy, even if other lesions are decreasing in size.  Increased FDG uptake in a 
previously unaffected site should only be considered relapsed or progressive disease 
after confirmation with other modalities.

Revised Criteria for Response Assessment: The Lugano Classification (Cohorts E, G−H) 
Response should be determined on the basis of radiographic and clinical evidence of disease.  For the e nd-of-treatment response 
assessment, an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose −positron emission tomography  (FDG -PET)/computed tomography  (CT) scan will be 
performed 6−[ADDRESS_1050685] study treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_766266].  Assessment of PET/CT scan should follow the criteria described by [CONTACT_27856] (2014 ) presented below.   
Selection of measured dominant (indicator) lesions:  
• Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal  lesions selected should be clearly measurable in two 
diameters : 
A measurable node must have a longest transverse diameter of a lesion (LDi)  > 1.[ADDRESS_1050686] an LDi  > 1.0 cm.  
• Nodes should preferably be from disparate r egions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and 
retroperitoneal areas.  
• Non-nodal lesions should include those in solid organs (e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs), gastrointestinal involvement, 
cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation.  
• If possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body.  
• They s hould include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved. 
 
Selection of non- measured (non -indicator) lesions:  
• Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be considered not measured.   
These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not 
meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any 
site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural effusions, 
ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_9661].

Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
2/P GO27834-A3   PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION A 3: 
RATIONALE 
Protocol GO27834 has been amended to enable the following changes: 
• In addition to sites in the [LOCATION_002], sites worldwide will now participate in the 
enrollment of patients into the non-randomized expansion cohorts (G and H) of the 
obinutuzumab portion of the study.  Cohorts G and H will each contain 40 patients 
with a diagnosis of either follicular NHL (Cohort G) or DLBCL (Cohort H) and will 
receive DCDS4501A at 1.8mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab. 
• In Section 1.2.3, the reference for Rituximab was updated from Product 
Insert/Summary of Product Characteristics to Investigator’s Brochure because Rituximab is an IMP in the protocol. 
• The criteria for opening enrollment to the expansion portion of the study have been 
modified.  Six patients will complete the safety observation period in the safety run-
in phase of the study before the expansion portion of the study can begin, because 
sufficient safety data will be collected to determine whether the 1.8 mg/kg dose of DCDS4501A (polatuzumab vedotin) is safe in combination with obinutuzumab. 
• Guidelines for dose modification of DCDS4501A (polatuzumab vedotin) have been 
updated to allow for dose reductions to 1.4 mg/kg of polatuzumab vedotin for Grade 
2 or Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy.  Dose reductions below 1.8 mg/kg of 
polatuzumab vedotin for neutropenia will not be allowed.  
• ePRO MDASI assessments have been removed for the obinutuzumab cohorts, as 
no comparison will be made for ePRO between the obinutuzumab and rituximab 
cohorts.  Only the rituximab cohorts will be assessed for ePRO. 
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest for this study have been updated as 
described below.  The proposed update does not impact the routine collection and 
regulatory reporting of the adverse events that are removed from the AESI list. 
Peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) is already classified as an adverse 
drug reaction for polatuzumab vedotin.  Therefore, non-serious adverse events 
suggestive of the diagnosis or signs/symptoms of peripheral neuropathy no 
longer need to be reported immediately by [CONTACT_63405].  This administrative amendment does not change the Sponsor’s approach in close monitoring of data suggestive of peripheral neuropathy.  Comprehensive adverse event documentation of actions taken on occurrence of the diagnosis or signs/symptoms suggestive of sensory and/or motor neuropathy and the adverse 
event outcome will continue.  
In addition, revision was made to include tumor lysis syndrome, a program-wide 
AESI for obinutuzumab. 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.   This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
COVER PAGE 
The Medical Monitor has been changed from , M.D. to  
M.D. 
PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
The protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the protocol, where 
applicable. 
SECTION 1.2.3:  Rituximab  
Refer to the Rituximab Product Insert/Summary of Product Characteristics  Investigator’s 
Brochure for complete details regarding clinical data related to approved indications.   
SECTION 1.3.1:  Rationale for Asses sing ADC Dose of 1.8 mg/kg Combined 
with Rituximab in iNHL  
In contrast to iNHL, treatment paradigms in relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphomas such as DLBCL continue to place a premium on anti-tumor activity and 
higher tolerance for treatment-related toxicity, given that the durations
 of disease control 
and survival are substantially shorter and that treatment options are extremely limited.  
Early Phase I data suggest lower rates of study treatment discontinuation for adverse events among patients with DLBCL compared with patients with iNHL.  Taken together with anti-tumor activity observed to date, the benefit-risk profile of the currently tested 
ADC dose of 1.82.4
 mg/kg is considered acceptable to combine with rituxminab in the 
treatment of patients with iNHL.   
SECTION 2.1:  PRIMARY OBJECTIVES 
• To assess the anti-tumor activity of the combination of DCDS4501A and 
obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and DLBCL based 
on PET-CR at the end of treatment according to IRC per Lugano 2014 response criteria  
 
SECTION 2.2.2:  Activity Objectives  
The secondary activity objective for rituximab-containing arms  of the study is the 
following: 
• To compare the anti-tumor activity of the combination of DCT2980S and rituximab 
and DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab 
The secondary activity objectives for obinut uzumab-containing arms of the study are the 
following: 
• CR at end of treatment based on PET alone, as determined by [CONTACT_093] 
• Objective response (OR; CR or PR) at end of treatment based on PET alone as determined by 
[CONTACT_766178]  
• CR at end of treatment based on CT only as determined by [CONTACT_648640] 
• OR at end of treatment based on CT only as determined by [CONTACT_766267]:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
4/P GO27834-A3 • Best objective response (BOR, CR or PR) while on study based on PET alone or CT only, as 
determined by [CONTACT_766268] 2.3.1:  Efficacy Objectives  
The exploratory efficacy objectives for this stu dy are to evaluate the long-term outcome of 
obinutuzumab-treated patients according to Lugan o 2014 response criteria, as measured by [CONTACT_14504]: 
• Duration of response based on PET and/or CT scans 
• Progression-free survival (PFS) b ased on PET and/or CT scans  
• Event-free survival (EFS) based on PET and/or CT scans 
• Overall survival 
 
SECTION 2.3.3:  Patient-Reported Outcomes Objective  
• To assess patient-reported tolerability to study treatment and the impact of study 
treatment on patient functioning on the basis of PRO  in Rituximab cohorts only  
 
SECTION 3.1:  DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This is a Phase Ib/II, multicenter, open-label study.  Up to approximately 2 4652  patients 
with relapsed or refractory FL and DLBCL will be enrolled at approximately 
30−40 investigative sites worldwide.   
Only investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002] will enroll patients into Cohort E.  
Investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002] , and Canada  and worldwide  will participate in 
Cohorts G and H) .   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Randomized Portion of the Study (Arms A 
and B)  − Closed to Enrollment   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Randomized Port ion of the Study with Rituximab 
(Cohorts C and D)  − Closed to Enrollment   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Obinutuzumab-Contai ning Regiment in Phase Ib:  Safety 
Run-In (Cohort E)  
This portion of the study will consist of a safe ty run-in that will evaluate the safety of 
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in 6 patients (Cohort E).  
The safety run-in is described in detail in Section 3.4.  In case an amendment to the 
protocol allows to study higher doses of DCDS4501A, the safety run in for th e 1.8  mg/kg 
may be shortened to 3 patients.  
SECTION 3.2:  RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A are were both being  evaluated as single agents and in 
combination with rituximab in the ongoing  Phase I studies Study DCT4862g and 
Study DCS4968g, respectively.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
5/P GO27834-A3 Study GO27834 will continue to assess the cumulative safety and longer-term tolerability 
of ADC-rituximab combination therapy.  Due to additional information about the benefit-risk 
profile of DCDS4501A at the 2.4 mg/kg dose, th e Sponsor is no longer pursuing the 2.4 mg/kg 
dose of DCDS4501A in the obinutuzumab-containing cohorts.  
SECTION 3.3.3:  Activity Outcome Measures  
The following activity outcome measures will be assessed  for rituximab-containing 
arms/cohorts (Arms A and B, Cohort C) : 
The following activity outcome measures wi ll be assessed for obinutuzumab-containing 
cohorts (Cohorts E, G, and H) according to Lugano 2014 Response Criteria (Cheson et al. 
2014): 
The primary activity outcome measure will be assessed by:  
• CR at end of treatment (6 −[ADDRESS_1050690] dose of study medication) 
based on PET  alone, as determined by [CONTACT_766269]: 
• OR (CR or PR) at end of treatment based on PET alone as determined by [CONTACT_766189]  
• CR at end of treatment based on CT only, as determined by [CONTACT_648640]  
• OR (CR or PR) at end of treatment based on CT  only as determined by [CONTACT_766201]  
• BOR (CR or PR) while on study based on PET alone or CT only, as determined by [CONTACT_766270] 3.3.4:  Exploratory Outcome Measures  
• Treatment and disease symptom assessments using the M.D. Anderson Symptom 
Inventory (MDASI)  in rituximab-containing cohorts only  
 
The following exploratory efficacy outcome measures will be assessed: 
• DOR, defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR or PR to 
the date of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause, for the subgroup of patients 
with a best overall response of CR or PR, b ased on PET and/or CT scans as determined by 
[CONTACT_766184].  For patients ac hieving a response who have not experienced 
disease progression, relapse, or died prior to the time of the analysis, the DOR will be 
censored on the date of last disease assessment. 
• PFS, defined as the time from date of randomization or first treatment (for G-containing 
arms) to the first occurrence of progression or relapse, or death from any cause , based on 
PET and/or CT scans as determined by [CONTACT_766184]. 
• EFS, defined as the time from date of randomization or first treatment (for G-containing 
arms) to any treatment failure including di sease progression relapse, initiation of new 
anti-lymphoma therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, based on PET 
and/or CT scans as determined by  [CONTACT_766184]  
• OS, defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
6/P GO27834-A3 SECTION 3.4.1:  Safety Run-In Analysis  
As outlined in Figure 3b and Section [IP_ADDRESS], a safety run-in analysis (Cohort E) will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_514866] (IMC) to evaluate the combination of DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg with obinutuzumab.  This analysis will include data 
from the first [ADDRESS_1050691] cycle.  The decision to enroll an additional 3 patients will be 
made by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor in consultation with the safety science leader, biostatistician, and participating investigators.  At the IMC’s discretion, and at any 
point during enrollment of the safety run-in, a decision could be made that more than 
6 patients are needed to evaluate safety.  Additional patients may also be enrolled at dose 
levels below 1.8 mg/kg of DCDS4501A (i.e., 1.4 mg/kg) based upon review of all safety data.   In 
this case, the protocol will be amended to allow for more than [ADDRESS_1050692] additional doses the safety run in for 1.8 
mg/kg may be shortened to three patients.  
Before the expansion portion of the study can begin (enrollment of 
Cohorts G and H), the following criteria must be met:  
sSix patients must have completed enrollment the safety observation period 
(Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 2 Day 1 for a minimum of 21 days)  in the safety run-in 
(Cohort E). 
1. Three patients must have completed at least 4 cycles of treatment.  
SECTION 3.4.2:  Intern al Monitoring Committee  
The IMC will include the [COMPANY_002]/Genentech Medical Monitor, at least one other Clinical Science

SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Immunization 
The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied.  Patients who participate in this study may not receive either primary or 
booster vaccination
 with live virus vaccines for at least 28 days  6 months  prior to initiation 
of rituximab or at any time during study treatment.  Investigators should review the 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
7/P GO27834-A3 vaccination  status of potential study patients being considered for this study and follow 
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for adult vaccination  with 
non-live vaccines intended to prevent infectious diseases prior to study therapy. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
TLS has been reported with obinutuzumab administration.  Patients with a high tumor 
burden, including patients with a lymphocyte count ≥ 25  × 109/L, particularly patients with 
B-cell CLL and MCL, are at increased risk for TLS and severe IRRs.  All patients with peripheral blood lymphocyte counts of ≥
 25  × 109/L or bulky adenopathy must receive 
prophylaxis for TLS prior to the initiation of study treatment.  This includes appropriate hydration, consisting of fluid intake of approximately 3 L/day, starting 1
−[ADDRESS_1050693] dose of obinutuzumab, and administration of allopurinol (300 mg/day orally) or a 
suitable alternative (i.e., rasburicase) treatment, starting at least 12  − [ADDRESS_1050694] infusion of obinutuzumab (Cycle 1, Day 1).  All patients should then be carefully 
monitored during the initial weeks of treatment.  Patients still considered at risk for TLS because of persistently high tumor burden (i .e., peripheral blood lymphocyte counts 
≥
 25  × 109/L) before the second and subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab should 
receive continuous TLS prophylaxis with allopurinol or a suitable alternative (i.e., rasburicase) and adequate hydration until the risk is abated, as determi ned by [CONTACT_1275].  For treatment of TLS, correct electrolyte ab normalities, monitor renal function and 
fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Immunization 
The safety of immunization with live virus vaccines following obinutuzumab therapy has not been studied.  Thus, vaccination with live viru s vaccines is not recommended during treatment 
and until B-cell recovery. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Worsening of Preexisting Cardiac Condition 
In patients with underlying cardiac disease and tr eated with obinutuzumab, adverse events such 
as angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and tac hyarrhythmia, have been observed.  These events 
may occur as part of an IRR and can be fatal.  Therefore, patients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely.  In addition, these patients should be hydrated with caution to 
prevent a potential fluid overload. 
SECTION 4.1.2:  Exclusion Criteria  
• Vaccination with a live vaccine within 28 days prior to treatment 
  
SECTION 4.2:  METHOD OF  TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
For obinutuzumab-containing cohorts (Cohorts E, G, and H), patients with either relapsed or refractory follicular NHL or relapsed or refractory DLBCL will be enrolled.  After the safety run-in stage for DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with 
obinutuzumab, the  non-randomized dose-expansion portion of the study will enroll 40 
relapsed or refractory FL  patients  into Cohort G and 40 relapsed or refractory DLBCL 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
8/P GO27834-A3 patients into Cohort H.  will be enrolled into the dose expa nsion portion with 
40 patients in each histology group.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Do sage and Administration 
c. General Information 
The total dose of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A for each patient will depend on the 
patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of each cycle.  The patient weight obtained during screening may be used for dose determination at all treatment cycles; if the patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of a given treatment cycle differs by >10% from the weight obtained during screening, t
hen the new weight should be used to 
calculate the dose.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Dosage Modification 
Specific guidelines around dosage modifications for neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy are detailed below in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  Patients who experience other treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity
 or laboratory abnormalities  will be allowed 
to delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab or obinutuzumab) for up to 2 weeks to allow for recovery.  Patients may continue to receive additional infusions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A per their treatment assignment provided that the toxicity has resolved to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of the baseline value, whichever is lower, within the 
2−week delay period.  Upon resolution, the dose for subsequent infusi ons may be 
reduced to 1.8  mg/kg (in Cohorts C and D) .  If the toxicity that resulted in the dose 
reduction persists or recurs at the reduced dose, then the patient should be discontinued 
from study treatment.  The decision for dose modification will be made on the basis of 
the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continued study treatment and in consultation with the Medical Monitor.   
Once dose reductions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A are made for toxicity, dose 
re-escalation will not be allowed.  Patients who are enrolled in the 
nonrandomized 
portion of the study (Cohorts  C and  D), are dosed at an ADC dose of 1.8  mg/kg, and 
have progressive disease in the absence of any drug related toxicity may have their 
ADC dose increased to 2.4  mg/kg  if it is felt that there is reasonable justification for 
ongoing clinical benefit.  The decision to increase the dose must be made in consultation 
with and approval of the Medical Monitor.  Patients in Cohorts E, G, and H 
(obinutuzumab containing cohorts)  will not be eligible for dose escalation . 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Neutropenia 
• If prophylactic G-CSF was not administered prior to the cycle in which the 
Grade 3−4 neutropenia developed, then prophylactic G-CSF may be administered 
prior to subsequent cycles without DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose reduction.  The 
dose schedule may be changed from 21-day to 28-day cycles to provide sufficient 
time for neutrophil recovery in subsequent cycles.  In the absence of prophylactic G-CSF or dose schedule modification, the dose of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A in 
subsequent cycles should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg  for Arms A and B.  For Cohorts 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
9/P GO27834-A3 E, G, and H, patients will be given DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg, and further 
dose reductions cannot be made.   
• If Grade 3− 4 neutropenia recurs with prophylactic G-CSF, the dose for subsequent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg  for Arms A and B.  
Prophylactic G-CSF and dose schedule modifications as described above are permitted in order to maintain the reduced DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose level and schedule. 
• For patients enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C 
and D, as well as Cohorts E, G, and H), dose reductions modifications
 will not be 
allowed for neutropenia .  Administration of therapeutic/prophylactic G-CSF and 
dose-schedule modifications as described above are allowed.  Patients who have persistent or recurrent Grade 3 −4 neutropenia as defined above should be 
discontinued from study treatment. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Peripheral Neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) is a known risk of DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  For new or worsening drug-related Grade 2 or 3 
peripheral sensory and/or motor neuropathy, dosing should be held for up to 2 weeks until peripheral neuropathy (sensory or
 motor)  improves to Grade 1 or baseline grade.  
Continuation of study treatment followi ng dose delays beyond 2 weeks will require 
consultation with and approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment of the benefit-risk analysis of continuing to delay study treatment. 
For patients enrolled on arms A or B f F
ollowing resolution of peripheral neuropathy 
(sensory and/or motor), subsequent doses of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be 
reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.  DCDS4501A s hould not be reduced to a dose lower than 
1.8 mg/kg.   If worsening Grade 2 or 3 peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) 
recurs following dose reduction, study treatment should be discontinued.  For Grade 43 
peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), study treatment should be discontinued.  
For patients enrolled into  Cohorts C and D, the nonrandomized portion of the study 
(Cohorts  C and  D), dose modifications will not be allowed.  Patients who have Grade 2 
or 3 peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), as defi ned above, should be 
discontinued from study treatment.   
For patients enrolled on Cohorts E, G, or H, following resolution of Grade 2 or Grade 3 
peripheral neuropathy (sensory  and/or motor), subsequent  doses of DCDS4501A should 
be permanently reduced from 1.8 mg/kg to 1. 4 mg/kg.  If worsening Grade 2 or Grade 3 
peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) recurs following dose reduction, study treatment should be discontinued.  For Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), study treatment should be discontinued.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Schedule Modification 
Specific guidelines around schedule modifications for thrombocytopenia and febrile 
neutropenia are detailed below in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
10/P GO27834-A3 SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Thrombocytopenia 
In the event of severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 10,000/μ L) and/or symptomatic 
bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who are not receiving concomitant 
anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors: 
• Hold obinutuzumab until thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding resolves.  If 
Cycle 1 Day 8 is delayed, then skip Day 8 and administer Day 15 as previously scheduled 
(if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding has resolved).  If Cycle 1 Day 15 is delayed, 
then skip Day 15 dosing and administer Cycle 2 Day 1 of obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A 
as scheduled (if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding has resolved).  but do not skip 
any doses of obinutuzumab for the sake of maintaining the study treatment 
schedule.  
 
In the event of thrombocytopenia with platelet count < 20,000/μL and/or symptomatic 
bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who are receiving concomitant 
anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors: 
• Hold obinutuzumab until thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding resolves., but 
do not skip any doses of obinutuzumab for t he sake of maintaining the study 
treatment schedule.   If Cycle 1 Day 8 is delayed, then skip Day 8 and administer Day 15 
as previously scheduled (if thrombocytopeni a or symptomatic bleeding has resolved).  If 
Cycle 1 Day 15 is delayed, then skip Day 15 dosing and administer Cycle 2 Day 1 of 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A as schedule d (if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic 
bleeding has resolved). 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Febrile Neutropenia 
In the event of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia with infection, hold obinutuzumab until febrile 
neutropenia or neutropenia with infection resolves.   
• If Cycle 1 Day 8 is delayed long enough that the patient is approaching Day 15, then skip 
Day 8 and administer Day 15 as previously scheduled (if infection or fever has resolved) 
• If Cycle 1 Day 15 is delayed long enough that  the patient approaching Cycle 2, then skip 
Day 15 dosing and administer Cycle 2 Day 1 of DCDS4501 as scheduled (if infection or 
fever has resolved) 
• Note:  Obinutuzumab Patients will receive DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg 
or 2.4 mg/kg by [CONTACT_95077] 1 or Day  should not be held for neutropenia without 
fever or infection 
 
SECTION 4.4.1:  Concomitant Therapy  
For patients enrolled on obinutuzumab-containing regimens, it is recommended that 
corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent)   oral prednisone, prednisolone, 
or methylprednisolone  be given as premedication within [ADDRESS_1050695] 
60 minutes prior to, the obinutuzumab infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Laboratory Assessments 
Central Laboratory Assesssments 
• ATA assays 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
11/P GO27834-A3 ATAs to DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, or obinutuzumab will be determined at 
Genentech  using a  validated ELISA s (see Section 4.9).  
Local Laboratory Assesssments 
• Serum chemistry:  sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN or local equivalent), creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, 
total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
LDH, and uric acid, amylase, and lipase  
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Electrocardiogram Assessments 
• Day 8 ( ± 1 day) of Cycle 3 time matched (i.e., obtained at the same time of day) with 
post-DCDT2980s/DCDS4501A infusion ECGs for Cycle 3 only for 
rituximab containing arms/cohorts  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Tumo r Response Assessments 
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and re-assessed at each 
subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response assessments will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], on the basis of physical examinations, CT scans, PET scans, and/or MRI scans, and bone marrow examinations, using standard response criteria for NHL 
(Cheson et al. 2007 ; Cheson et al. 2014 ) (see Appendix C-1 and C-2). 
b. Radiographic Assessments for Patien ts on Obinutuzumab-Containing 
Cohorts  
PET and CT scans are required for follicular NHL and DLBCL patients at screening, after 
Cycle 4 of study treatment (i.e., between Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1), and at EOT.  The EOT response assessment should be performed 6
−[ADDRESS_1050696]  Rresponse 
Ccriteria for NHL (see Appendix C-2).   
c. Bone Marrow Assessments 
A bone marrow biopsy for morphology is required at screening and should reflect 
disease status in the bone marrow following documented relapse on the last prior 
therapy or within 3 months of Day 1, whichever occurs later.  For obinutuzumab-containing 
cohorts, only follicular NHL patients are required to undergo a bo ne marrow biopsy at screening.    
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Patient-Reported Outcomes 
PRO data will be elicited from all patients in this study (with the exception of Cohorts E, 
G, and H) to more fully characterize the clinical profile of study treatment.  The MDASI 
PRO instrument will be supplied in the local language of each participating country.  Electronic (handheld computers) will be used for the daily collection of symptoms derived from the MDASI.

SECTION 4.9.6:  Anti-Therapeutic Antibody  
ATAs against obinutuzumab in serum samples will be measured using a validated bridging antibody ELISA and characterized by a competitive binding assay . 
SECTION 4.9.7:  Biomarker Assays  
Tumor tissue assessment of biomarkers will be assayed using IHC, ISH, qPCR gene 
expression profiling using microarray and mutation detection assays.  Circulating Tumor 
DNA (ctDNA) in plasma samples maywill  be assessed using a next generation 
sequencing approach (CAPP-Seq) to detect and quantitate lymphoma specific markers (Newman et al. 2014).
 
SECTION 4.10.4:  Activity Analyses  
For patients with DLBCL or FL  on obinutuzumab-containing cohorts, primary response 
assessment for both DLBCL and FL will be primary assessment of tumor response will 
be based on PET/CT scans  using the updated 2014 Lugano Response Criteria.   Given 
the new Lugano Classification, 2014, criteri a which recommend that complete response 
(PET CR) be determined by [CONTACT_766271],scanResponse Criteria  as determined by [CONTACT_766272] (IRCF).   Ppatients in Cohorts E, G, and H will be 
evaluated with a PET- CT scan at screening, between Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 
1, and at the end of treatment ( 6-8 weeks after completing treatment ).  The efficacy 
analysis for these cohorts will, therefore, be different from the analysis for Arms A-B and 
Cohorts C-D (Cheson, et al 2014) (see Appendix C-2).   Subsequent imaging can be CT 
only.  Responses to study treatment will also be based on investigator assessments.  
SECTION 4.10.5:  Exploratory Analyses  
Frequencies and percentages of missing data for the PRO endpoints will be reported.  Dropouts 
(defined as patients withdrawing from treatment for reasons other than documented disease progression or death) will be summarized

Study Design  
Description of Study 
This is a Phase Ib/II, multicenter, open-l abel study.  Up to approximately 2 46 patients with 
relapsed or refractory FL and DLBC L will be enrolled at approximately 30 −40 investigative sites 
worldwide.  Additional patients may be enrolled in order to obtain additional safety and/or 
efficacy data. Arms A and B and Cohort C are no longer enrolling patients. 
For Obinutuzumab Cohorts:  
Only investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002] will enroll patients into Cohort E.  Investigational 
sites in the [LOCATION_002] and worldwide  will participate in Cohorts G and H). 
The study will be composed of a randomiz ed portion and a non-randomized portion, as 
described in the protocol.

27/P GO27834-A3 Rituximab-Containing Regimens with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A  
Randomized Portion of the Study (Arms A and B)  − Closed to Enrollment  
Following determination of eligibility, patients within each disease group will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments: 
• Arm A:  Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S (2.4 mg/kg) every 21 days; 
• Arm B:  Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A (2.4 mg/kg) every [ADDRESS_1050712] to the following 
stratification factors: 
• For patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) (see the protocol for definitions) 
Rituximab refractory disease (no response or disease relapse <  [ADDRESS_1050713] 
rituximab treatment) versus rituximab relapsed disease (disease relapse after response ≥
  [ADDRESS_1050714] rituximab treatment) 
• For patients with DLBCL (see the protocol for definitions) 
Second-line versus third-line (or beyond) therapy 
For second-line patients, disease relapse or no objective response (complete response 
[CR], unconfirmed CR [CRu], or partial respon se [PR]) <12 months from the start of 
initial therapy versus disease relapse, after initial objective response (CR, unconfirmed 
response [CRu] or PR), ≥ [ADDRESS_1050715]-line patients, failure to achieve a CR or progression < [ADDRESS_1050716] recent therapy versus CR or progression ≥ [ADDRESS_1050717] recent 
therapy 
No formal testing comparing the two treatment ar ms in the randomized portion of the study is 
planned. 
Non-Randomized Portion of the Study with Rituximab (Cohorts C and D)  − Closed to 
Enrollment 
Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the non-randomized portion of 
the study will enroll patients into these cohorts. 
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled in Cohorts C and D to receive 
rituximab (375 mg/m2) combined with DCDT2980S or DCDS450 1A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg.  The 
first day of treatment constitutes Day 1 of each cycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766116] 21 days in duration. The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s discre tion and only after the 
enrollment of patients with FL into the randomized portion of the study is completed.  Patients 
will not be randomized to receive one treatment or  the other.  It is anticipated that Cohort C 
and D will be opened sequentially.   
All Patients on Rituximab-Containing Arms/Cohorts
 
All patients on rituximab-containing regimens, regardless of assigned arm/cohort, will receive 
DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion on a 
21-day cycle.  For the first two cycles, rituxi mab will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 1 
and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A will be administered by  [CONTACT_95077] 2.  In the absence 
of any infusion-related adverse events, ri tuximab and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be 
administered on the same day (Day 1) in subseque nt cycles beginning with the third cycle.  In 
this instance, rituximab will be administered fi rst, followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S or DCDS4501A.  In 
certain circumstances ⎯for example, infusion-related reacti ons (IRRs) requiring interruption or 
slowing of infusion rate ⎯rituximab may be administered over 2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of 
the cycle); in this case, DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be administered on Day 2 following completion of the rituximab infusion or on Day 3 of the cycle. 
Patients may receive treatments for up to 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule) if not 
discontinued because of significant toxicity, di sease progression, or withdrawal from study. 
Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the Schedules of Assessments 
outlined in the protocol.  Initial response asse ssments in this study will be performed every 
3 months from the initiation of therapy until study treatment completion or early termination 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
28/P GO27834-A3 (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1050718] 
eight 21-day cycles of treatment).  Additional response assessments for patients who proceed 
to crossover treatment will be performed as described in the protocol; respon se assessments 
for patients who discontinue study treatment (bot h initially assigned treatment and crossover 
treatment) for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as described in the 
protocol. 
Responses to study treatment w ill be based on investigator assessments.  In addition, tumor 
assessment data will be transmitted to an Independen t Review Facility (IRF) for collection and 
possible independent review. 
Obinutuzumab-Containing Regimens with DCDS4501A (Cohorts E, G, and H)  
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg will be given in combination with obinutuzumab to patients with 
relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and DL BCL in two stages: (1) safety run-in and (2) 
expansion . 
Study treatment will be given in 21-day cycles fo r both follicular NHL and DLBCL.  Patients will 
be treated for up to a total of [ADDRESS_1050719] cycle, obinutuzumab will be administered by 
[CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, and 15.  DCDS4501A will be given on Day 2 for Cycle 1.  In the 
absence of any infusion-related adverse events, obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A may be 
administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent  cycles beginning with the second cycle.  If 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A are administered on the same day, the study drugs will be 
given sequentially.  Obinutuzumab will be admin istered first, followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A.  In 
certain circumstances ⎯for example, IRRs requiring interruption or slowing of infusion 
rate⎯obinutuzumab may be administered over 2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the cycle); in 
this case, DCDS4501A may be administered on Day 2 following completion of the 
obinutuzumab infusion. 
Obinutuzumab-Containing Regimen in Phase Ib: Safety Run-In (Cohort E) 
This portion of the study will consist of a safe ty run-in that will evaluate the safety of 
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in 6 patients (Cohort E).  The 
safety run-in is described in detail in the protocol.   
Obinutuzumab-Containing Regimens in Phase II:  Expansion Stage (Cohorts G and H) 
After the safety run-in has demonstrated that DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with 
obinutuzumab is safe to administer, patients w ill be enrolled into two expansion c ohorts based 
on histology of follicular NHL or DLBCL (Cohorts  G and H respectively).   Forty patients will be 
enrolled into each expansion cohort.  An additional cohort(s) may be added in the future. 
Follicular NHL Patients for Ri tuximab-Containing Arms/Cohorts  
Patients with relapsed or refrac tory follicular NHL will be enrolled into the study as defined by 
[CONTACT_716]: 
• Relapsed  to regimens containing rituximab, defined as documented history of response 
(CR, CRu, or PR) of ≥  6 months in duration from completion of all prior  rituximab-containing 
regimens.  A rituximab-containing regimen is defined as rituximab as a single agent during 
induction and/or maintenance or in combination with other agents during induction and/or maintenance.

≥ 6 months from start of prior therapy (third-line + relapsed ) 
 
Enrollment into any of the above four categorie s may be limited to no greater than 40% of the 
DLBCL cohort—and to no more than 60% of the two refractory categories combined—in order 
to avoid overrepresentation of any specific su bpopulation, refractory patients in particular. 
DLBCL Patients for Obinutuzumab-Containing Cohorts

Crossover Treatment (Randomized Patients in Arms A and B Only)  
Patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B who dev elop progressive disease may be eligible to 
receive crossover treatment consisting of ri tuximab and the other antibody-drug conjugate 
(ADC) or the other ADC alone ⎯for example, Arm B treatment for patients who have disease 
progression while receiving Ar m A treatment, and vice versa ⎯provided the following conditions 
are met: 
• Patients must not have experienced a to xicity requiring the discontinuation of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment OR experienced  toxicity during the last dose of study 
treatment that would preclude treatment with the crossover regimen. 
Patients who had modifications to dosing and/ or schedule on the initial study treatment 
will be permitted to receive cr ossover treatment in the absence of toxicities on the 
modified dose and/or schedule.  The dose and schedule of crossover treatment will be 
determined by [CONTACT_33495]. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
30/P GO27834-A3 Patients who had rituximab discontinued and continued on single-agent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment may rece ive crossover treatment of single-agent 
DCDS4501A/ DCDT2980S. 
• Patients must have radiographically documented disease progression. 
• Patients must meet all inclusion and exclusio n criteria described in the Inclusion Criteria 
and Exclusion Criteria sections below, except fo r those related to prior rituximab treatment. 
• Acceptable toxicity:  All study drug–related adv erse events from the initial study treatment 
must have decreased to Grade [ADDRESS_1050723] day of treatment 
on the crossover regimen.  Exceptions may be allowed after a careful assessment and discussion of the benefit-risk balance with the pat ient by [CONTACT_766276]. 
• Administration of crossover treatment must  be in the best interests of the patient as 
determined after a careful assessment and discussion of benefit-risk balance with the patient by [CONTACT_766277]. 
• A tumor biopsy (described in the protocol) will be required for pat ients with safely accessible 
site of disease, defined as requiring only loca l anesthesia and, in general, excluding the 
brain, lungs or any internal organs that may subject patients to significant risk.  
Patients for whom a safely ac cessible site of disease is not present may still receive 
crossover treatment without undergoing a biopsy.  Eligibility to receive crossover 
treatment should be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_1689]. 
A tumor biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease is optional for patients who are 
not eligible for study cross over.  
 Patients who are determined to be eligible for study cross over will be treated as follows: 
• Assessments obtained at the initial study treatment discontinuation visit (described in the 
protocol) may be used as screening assessm ents for crossover treatment.  The following 
re-screening assessments must  be repeated/obtained within 1 week prior to starting 
treatment on the crossover regimen, in order to  re-establish baseline pretreatment clinical 
and disease status:  targeted physical exam, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, and hematology and serum chemistry laboratory tests. 
Re-screening tests for hepatitis B and C do not need to be performed unless there is 
clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_136701] B and/or C positivity. 
A radiographic tumor assessment must also be performed, unless already done to 
document disease progression, within 6 we eks prior to starting crossover treatment. 
• Crossover treatment will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1050724] dose of the prior study 
treatment. 
 
Patients will be treated with the crossover treat ment until a second disease progression event 
relative to the tumor assessment, document ing progressive disease on the initial study 
treatment, clinical deterioration, and/or intole rance to the crossover treatment for up to a 
maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule).  Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules of assessments outlined in the protocol.  
Response assessments for patients who discontin ue study treatment for reasons other than 
disease progression will be performed as described in the protocol.  
Clinical data and exploratory data derived from  tumor biopsies obtained prior to crossover 
treatment will be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Ge nentech has the right to  restrict or suspend 
enrollment into crossover treatment at any time .  Reasons for this may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
• The incidence or severity of adverse events during crossover treatment indicates a potential 
safety hazard to patients. 
• Patient enrollment into crossove r treatment is unsatisfactory. 
• Data recording is inac curate or incomplete.  
• Patients who are enrolled into the non-randomiz ed portion of the study (Cohorts C, D, E, G, 
and H) will not have the option to receive cr ossover treatment upon disease progression.

Non-Investigational Medicinal Products  
Not applicable. Statistical Methods
 
The final analysis will be based on patient data collected until all patients discontinue from the 
study or the study is terminat ed by [CONTACT_1034], whichever oc curs first.  The analyses will be 
based on the safety evaluable population, defined as patients who received at least one dose of 
study treatment.  All summaries will be presented according to the disease-specific cohort, 
treatment group, and assigned dose level. 
Analysis of the Conduct of the Study 
Enrollment, major protocol violations, and reasons for discontinuations from the study will be 
summarized. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, weight, duration of 
malignancy, and baseline ECOG Performance Status, will be summarized using means, 
standard deviations, medians, and ranges fo r continuous variables and proportions for 
categorical variables.  All summaries will be pres ented overall and by [CONTACT_1570], assigned 
dose level, and disease-specific cohort. 
Study drug administration data will be listed by t he disease-specific cohor ts described in the 
protocol.  Any dose modifications will be flagged.  Means and standard deviations will be used 
to summarize the total doses of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A , rituximab, and obinutuzumab  
received.  All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], assigned dose level, and disease-specific cohort. 
Safety Analysis
 
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adv erse events, changes in laboratory test 
results, changes in physical findings on physica l examinations, and changes in vital signs.  All 
patients who receive any am ount of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A , rituximab,  or obinutuzumab will 
be included in the safety analysis and will be assigne d to the treatment group on the basis of 
the study treatment received.  Patients who have dose level changes from the initial assigned 
dose level will be summarized by [CONTACT_133069] a ssigned dose level of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A. 
All adverse event data will be listed by [CONTACT_82385], patient number,  treatment group, 
disease-specific cohort, and cycle.  All adverse  events occurring on or after treatment on Day 1 
of Cycle 1 will be summarized by [CONTACT_570618], appropriate thesaurus levels, and 
NCI CTCAE v4.0 toxicity grade.  In addition, a ll serious adverse events, including deaths will be 
listed separately and summarized.   
Selected laboratory data will be listed, with val ues outside of normal ranges identified.  The 
incidence of antibodies to DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A will be summarized. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
36/P GO27834-A3 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Individual and mean serum concentrations of  total DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A antibody 
(conjugated and unconjugated antibody) and rituximab  or obinutuzumab and plasma 
concentrations of acMMAE and free MMAE versus time data will be tabulated and plotted by 
[CONTACT_766205] (relapsed or refractory follicular NHL or DLBCL).  The pharmacokinetics 
of the above analytes will be summarized by [CONTACT_570674] 
(e.g., AUC, C max, CL, V ss, and t 1/2).  Estimates for these parameters will be tabulated and 
summarized (mean, standard deviation, and ra nge).  Non-compartmental, compartmental, 
and/or population methods will be used, as data allow.  
Exposure-response (safety and efficacy) analysis may be conducted with use of PK data and 
available drug effect (e.g., imaging, measures of tumor burden) and toxi city (e.g., clinical 
pathology) data, at the sponsor’s discretion. 
In addition, population PK methods may be employed to manage sparse data and to investigate 
the effects of certain covariates on the p harmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, as 
data allow, and at the sponsor’s discretion. 
Activity Analyses 
Best overall response, duration of respon se, and PFS will be listed for all patients. 
Overall response rate (ORR) from the initial st udy treatment will be calculated on the basis of 
data from patients who received st udy treatment.  Objective response is defined as CR or PR 
as determined by [CONTACT_093], on the basis of physical examinations, radiographic scans, 
and bone marrow examinations, using modified re sponse criteria for NHL and confirmed by 
[CONTACT_294862] ≥ 4 weeks after initial documentation.  Any patient with insufficient data to 
determine response will be classified as a non-responder. 
For patients with DLBCL, prim ary assessment of tumor resp onse will be based on diagnostic 
imaging scans ⎯for example, CT and/or MRI scans and positron emission tomography  (PET) 
scans.  For patients with FL  enrolled on rituximab-containing arms/cohorts, primary assessment 
of response will be based on CT scans only; the assessment of response in FL based on PET 
scans will be performed for exploratory purposes only. 
For patients on obinutuzumab-containing cohorts, primary response assessment for both 
DLBCL and FL will be  based on PET/CT scans using the updated [ADDRESS_1050734] scan at screening, 
between Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1, and at the end of treatment (6-8 weeks after completing treatment).  The efficacy  analysis for these cohorts will,  therefore, be different from 
the analysis for Arms A-B and Cohorts C-D. (Cheson, et al 2014) (see Appendix C-2).  
Subsequent imaging can be CT only.  Responses to study treatment will also be based on 
investigator assessments.  
Among patients with an objective response, duration of response will be defined as the time 
from the initial documentation of a  CR or PR to the time of disease progression or death.  If a 
patient does not experience death or disease progression before the end of the study, duration of response will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), PFS is defined as the time from the 
date of randomization to the date of disease pr ogression or death from any cause, whichever 
occurs first.  If a patient has not experienced progressive disease or death, PFS will be 
censored at the date of the last tumor asse ssment.  Patients with no post-baseline tumor 
assessment will be censored on the date of randomization.  For the non-randomized portion of 
the study (Cohorts C through H), PFS is defined as  the time from the date of study enrollment to 
the date of disease progression or death fr om any cause, whichever occurs first. 
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.  For the non-randomized portion of the 
study (Cohorts C through H), OS is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to date 
of death from any cause.

37/P GO27834-A3 Frequencies and percentages of missing data for the PRO endpoints will be reported.  Dropouts (defined 
as patients withdrawing from treatment for reasons other than documented disease progression or death) 
will be summarized. 
Summary statistics of the MDASI items, scale s, and their changes from baseline will be 
calculated at each assessment timepoint.  The mean, standard error, and median of the 
absolute scores and the mean changes from ba seline (and 95% CI) within and between study 
arms will be reported for the MDASI scales and single items, as well as the weekly averages of 
the worst symptom rating.  For change scores in the MDASI from baseline, patients without 
baseline scores will not be included in the analyse s.  Line charts depi[INVESTIGATOR_766118].   
Repeated measures mixed-effects models will explore MDASI subs cale scores with a baseline 
score and appropriate covariates added, as appropriate. 
Handling of Missing Data  
For the endpoint of objective response, patient s without a post-baseline tumor assessment will 
be considered non-responders in the all-treated population analysis.  
For duration of response and PFS, data from pat ients who are lost to follow-up will be included 
in the analysis as censored observations on t he last date that the patient is known to be 
progression free, defined as the date of the last  tumor assessment, or, if no tumor assessments 
were performed, as the date of last study treatment plus 1 day. 
Compliance to PRO data collection will be re ported with summary statistics, including 
frequencies of reasons for non-compliance such as patient refusal to complete PRO data 
collection.   Determination of Sample Size 
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), a target of 120 patients will be enrolled 
in two separate cohorts of patient s (40 in the follicular NHL cohort  and 80 in the DLBCL cohort).  
The randomized portion of this study is non-co mparative in nature.  No formal hypothesis 
testing is planned to compare the treatment arms .  Moreover, there is insufficient power to 
detect minimum clinically meaningful differences between the two treatment arms.  Genentech has judged the proposed sample size to provide su fficient precision in estimating the anti-tumor 
activity of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab or DCDS4501A combined with rituximab as measured by [CONTACT_33966].  For example, with the assumption of an observed response 
rate of 40%, a 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be approximately 22% −58% 
(i.e., 40% ±  18%) for the follicular NHL cohort and approximately 27% −53% (i.e., 40% ± 13%) 
for the DLBCL cohort.  With 40 patients, there is an 87% chance of observing at least one adverse event with a true incidence of 5%. 
For the non-randomized portions of the study (Cohorts C and D), approximately 20 patients will 
be enrolled into each arm, for a total of 40 pat ients.   With 20 patients under an observed 
response rate of 40%, the exact Clopper-Pearson 90%  confidence interval for the response rate 
would be 22% −61%.  With respect to the assessment of safety based upon a sample size of 
[ADDRESS_1050735] one adverse event with a true incidence of 10% is 
88%. For the obinutuzumab safety run-in cohort (Co hort E), 6 patients will be enrolled.  For the 
obinutuzumab expansion cohorts (Cohorts G and H), 40 patients with follicular NHL and 
40 patients with DLBCL will be enrolled at the RP2D  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of 
the combination.  Table 3 in the protocol provid es asymptotic 90% confidence intervals for the 
true probability of response for a range of observed proportions based upon a sample of 
40 patients.  A sample size of 40 patients is deemed sufficient to provide adequate precision on 
the point estimate and for the lower end of the 90% CI to rule out a clinically uninteresting rate 
of 45% assuming observed response rates of approximately 60% or higher (~24 responders 
observed among 40 patients). 
Therefore, up to 252 patients may be enrolled in this study.

42/P GO27834-A3 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON DISEASE  
B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders are a heterogeneous group of malignancies,  ranging 
from slow-growing indolent and incurable diseases with a median survival of 8 −10 years 
(such as follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL ]) to more aggressive intermediate- to 
high-grade lymphomas (such as diffuse large-cell lymphoma), which can have a median 
survival of 6 months if left untreated or l ong-term remission in more than 50% of patients 
with appropriate treatment.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL accounting for approximately 30% −40% of all new patients, whereas 
follicular lymphoma (FL) accounts for approximately 20% −25% of new lymphomas.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_766148]20-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) rituximab (Rituxan
®, MabThera®) in 
combination with chemotherapy, indolent B-cell malignancies remain incurable, as do approximately half of aggressive NHL patients.  Thus, there is still a need for treatments that can be combined with chemoimmunotherapy and can significantly extend disease-free and overall survival (OS) in thes e patients, with at least acceptable, if not 
superior, safety profiles. 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON THE MOLECULES 
1.2.1 DCDT2980S  
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Preclinical Data 
CD22 is a cell-surface antigen whose expression is restricted to all mature B cells except 
plasma cells.  It is expressed in a majority of the B cell −derived malignancies, including 
nearly all NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukem ia (CLL) samples tested (see Figure 1 ).  
Antibodies bound to CD22 are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570580], making CD22 ideally suited for targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents (Shan and Press 1995).   
DCDT2980S is an antibody −drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of a potent anti-mitotic 
agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) c onjugated to a humanized immunoglobulin-G1 
(IgG1) anti-CD22 MAb, MCDT2219A, via a protease-labile linker, 
maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-am inobenzoyloxycarbonyl (MC-VC-PABC).  
MMAE has a mode of action similar to vincristine, which is a component of standard chemotherapy used in lymphoma therapy.  This therapeutic approach takes advantage 
of the specific targeting capability of the antibody and the cytotoxic activity of MMAE.  Following internalization, the MMAE is deconjugated from DCDT2980S by [CONTACT_570622], binds to tubulin, and disrupts the microtubule network, resulting in inhibition of cell division and cell growth and induction of apoptosis (Doronina et al. 2003).

CLL  = chronic lymphocytic leukemia; DLBCL  = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; FL  = follicular 
lymphoma; MCL  = mantle cell lymphoma; MFI  = mean fluorescence intensity; MZL  =  marginal 
zone lymphoma. 
CD22 expression levels (MFI) on B-cell tumor cells were assessed by [CONTACT_766208] B-cell lymphomas:  CLL (n  = 49), DLBCL (n  = 59), FL (n  = 58), 
MCL (n  = 20), and MZL (n  = 60).  
 
Comprehensive pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and 
toxicology evaluations were conducted to support the use of DCDT2980S in clinical trials.  DCDT2980S binds human CD22 with a high affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant [K
d] = 1.7  ± 0.2 nM) and showed similar binding a ffinity to cynomolgus monkey 
CD22.  No binding activity was observed with mouse and rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).   
The unconjugated antibody MCDT2219A did not appear to induce antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in vitro.  In contrast, DCDT2980S displayed potent and selective inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro (50% of the maximal inhibitory concentration [IC
50] = 0.33 nM) by [CONTACT_766209].  Efficacy studies conducted in murine xenograft models of human lymphoma 
(CD22-positive WSU-DLCL2 and BJAB cell lines) showed that a single dose of DCDT2980S resulted in regression of tumor growth at doses ranging from 1 to 4 mg/kg.  PD studies with DCDT2980S showed that a single dose of 1 −6 mg/kg resulted in partial 
depletion of peripheral blood B cells in cynomolgus monkeys with a corresponding depletion in germinal center B cells in lymphoid tissue. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
44/P GO27834-A3 The PK profiles of DCDT2980S were observed to be linear in rodents and moderately 
non-linear in cynomolgus monkeys over the tested dose range.  The non-linear 
clearance (CL) observed in cynomolgus monk eys with DCDT2980S is likely due to the 
contribution of B cell-mediated CL to the total CL.  The free MMAE concentrations in cynomolgus monkeys following DCDT2980S administration were generally 10,[ADDRESS_1050739] relevant nonclinical species for the 
toxicology and PK/PD studies of DCDT2980S, given the comparable sequence homology of human and cynomol gus monkey CD22, similar binding affinity of 
DCDT2980S to human and cynomolgus monk ey CD22, and comparable tissue 
cross-reactivity in both human and cynomol gus monkey tissues.  DCDT2980S was well 
tolerated at doses of up to 3 mg/kg (highest non-severely toxic dose [HNSTD]) in monkeys and up to or greater than 10 mg/kg in rats (severely toxic dose to 10% [STD
10] 
of rats ≥ 10 mg/kg).  Reversible bone marrow toxicity and associated hematopoietic 
changes were observed in both rats and m onkeys treated with DCDT2980S or MMAE, 
suggesting that the toxicity of DCDT2980S is related to MMAE.  Additional effects on liver and lung in rats were minimal in severity and reversible and did not occur in cynomolgus monkeys, which may be due to differ ences in species sensitivity, exposure, 
and/or pharmacokinetics.   
Complete details of preclinical studies of DCDT2980S can be found in the DCDT2980S 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] DCDT2980S Clinical Data 
a. Patient Enrollment 
Both DCDT2980S monotherapy and combination therapy with rituximab have been 
studied in a Phase I study (Study DCT4862g) of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies expected to express CD22, including indolent NHL, DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and CLL. 
All data presented herein is based on a data entry cutoff of 22 February 2013, with 
clinical data available from 65 patients with NHL (excluding patients with CLL) enrolled in dose-escalation and expansion cohorts.  These include 49 patients who were treated with single-agent DCDT2980S at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg administered intravenously every 21 days and 16 patients who were enrolled into two Phase Ib cohorts with DCDT2980S administered at doses of 1.8 mg/kg (5 patients) and 2.4 mg/kg (11 patients) in combination with 375 mg/m
2 rituximab. 
Enrollment into CLL dose escalation cohorts was closed on 31 May 2013.  Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure for details regarding clinical data in CLL patients. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
45/P GO27834-A3 b. Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S have bee n characterized in the Phase I 
Study DCT4862g.  DCDT2980S was administered to patients with NHL at dose levels 
ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w).  Three analytes were quantified:  antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), total antibody, and free MMAE.  
Preliminary PK analysis based on available data as of 22 June 2012 is summarized 
below.   
The mean value of CL estimates of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level for 
doses of ≥
 1.0 mg/kg ranged from 17.6 to 21.3 mL/day/kg and from 10.5 to 
16.2 mL/day/kg, respectively.  Similar CL estimates for doses ≥ 1.0 mg/kg suggested 
dose-proportional increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposure.  CL estimates appeared to be slightly higher at doses <
 1.0 mg/kg (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg), although 
data from these dose levels are limited.  The CL of acMMAE was faster than that of total antibody at each dose level.   
In patients with NHL, the mean value of the steady-state volume of distribution (V
ss) of 
acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level ranged from 69.2 to 130 mL/kg and from 
97.4 to 154 mL/kg, respectively, across the dose levels tested, approximating human serum volume.  V
ss values did not appear to change substantially with dose.  The half-life 
for acMMAE and total antibody ranged from 2. 9 to 7.0 days and from 4.4 to 13 days, 
respectively.   
For acMMAE and total antibody, the time to maximum concentration occurred 
immediately after infusion.  For free MMAE, the time to maximum concentration was approximately 2 to 3 days after infusion.  Maximum plasma and serum concentration (C
max) and area under the concentration-time curve from Time 0 to infinity (AUC inf) of free 
MMAE appeared to increase with dose across the dose levels tested.  A half-life of 3-4 days for free MMAE was observed, which is relatively long and similar to that of its parent conjugate, suggesting formation rate −limited kinetics of free MMAE.  No 
accumulation of free MMAE is expected for the q3w regimen.  The C
max values of free 
MMAE in NHL patients were at least 100-fold lower than acMMAE concentrations at each dose level, suggesting a slow release of free MMAE from acMMAE and potentially fast elimination once it is formed.  
Preliminary comparisons of pharmacokinetics between patients with NHL and CLL (for 
which patients are enrolled into separate dose-escalation cohorts) treated with identical doses of DCDT2980S provide some insight into the factors that affect pharmacokinetics.  Both acMMAE and total antibody were cleared faster in CLL patients than in NHL patients.  This observation is likely to be related to the high number of circulating B cells generally observed in CLL patients, which may result in significant target-mediated CL of DCDT2980S.  The free MMAE exposure in CLL patients was relatively low compared to that of its parent conjugate.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
46/P GO27834-A3 The exposure parameters (C max and AUC inf) of total antibody, acMMAE, and free MMAE 
were similar between DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S + rituximab at doses of 1.8 and 
2.4 mg/kg, based on preliminary data.  This observation suggests that when given in combination, rituximab does not impact the pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S; the effect of DCDT2980S on rituximab pharmacokinetics will be assessed. 
All observations will be verified with additional data from the ongoing Phase I study as 
well as this study.  
Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure for complete and updated details. 
c. Safety 
Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Study DCT4862g utilizes a standard 3  + [ADDRESS_1050740] been 
observed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1050741] dose of DCDT2980S.  Any patient who did not complete the DLT observation period for any reason other than a DLT was replaced. 
Separate dose-escalation cohorts enrolled patients with B-cell NHL and CLL.  For the 
NHL dose escalation, DLTs of Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient out of 3 DLT-evaluable patients in the 3.2 mg/kg single-agent cohort and 1 patient out of 11 DLT-evaluable patients in the 2.4 mg/kg + rituximab cohort.  Consequently, DCDT2980S at 2.4 mg/kg was determined to be the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) as both monotherapy and in combination with rituximab.   
For the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, one DLT was reported to date.  This Grade 5 event 
of febrile neutropenia resulted in the patient’s death.  Whereas the contribution of the study drug to the neutropenia could not be completely ruled out, other factors, including bone marrow involvement of disease that resulted in baseline anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and clinical evidence of disease progression may have also played a contributory role. 
Single-Agent DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S Combined with Rituximab in 
NHL 
Forty-nine patients received single-agent DCDT2980S at a starting dose of  ≥ 1.8 mg/kg 
(7 at 1.8 mg/kg, 42 at 2.4 mg/kg); 16 patients received DCDT2980S at a starting dose of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg in combination with rituximab (5 at 1.8 mg/kg, 11 at 2.4 mg/kg).  Overall 
the safety profile of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab did not differ from that of single-agent DCDT2980S. 
Treatment-emergent hematologic and commonly reported nonhematologic adverse 
events for all grades in patients treat ed with single-agent DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S 
plus rituximab included neutropenia (29%), febrile neutropenia (3%), infection (system organ class; 43%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (12%), peripheral neuropathy 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
47/P GO27834-A3 (28%), diarrhea (40%), pyrexia (14%), nausea (34%), and fatigue (55%).  
Treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included neutropenia (25%), febrile 
neutropenia (3%), infection (system organ class; 11%), anemia (5%), peripheral neuropathy (3%), diarrhea (5%), pyrexia (2%), and fatigue (3%).  Serious adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_766210]2980S were reported in 21% of patients.   Dose discontinuations for adverse events were reported in 20% of patients. 
Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator’s Brochure for complete and updated details 
related to safety.  
d. Efficacy in Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
Investigator-based objective responses were observed in 17 of 43 (40%) patients trea ted 
with single-agent DCDT2980S and 5 of 15 (33%) patients treated with DCDT2980S combined with rituximab.  Among patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, 11 of 28 (39%) objective responses (5 complete re sponses [CR] and 6 partial responses [PR]) 
were observed with single-agent DCDT2980S and 3 of 7 (43%; 2 CR, 1 PR) with DCDT2980S combined with rituximab.  Among patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL (iNHL), 6 of 13 (46%) objective responses (2 CR, 4 PR) were observed with single-agent DCDT2980S and 1 of 4 (PR) with DCDT2980S combined with rituximab.   
Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure for complete and updated details related 
to anti-tumor activity. 
1.2.2 DCDS4501A  
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Preclinical Data 
CD79b is a cell-surface antigen whose expression is restricted to all mature B cells except plasma cells.  It is expressed in a majority of B cell −derived malignancies, 
including nearly all NHL and CLL samples tested (see Figure 2) (Dornan et al. 2009 ).  
Antibodies bound to CD79b are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570580], making CD79b ideally suited for targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents (Polson et al. 2007, 2009).   
Similar to DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A is an ADC that contains a humanized immunoglobulin-G1 (IgG1) anti −human CD79b MAb (MCDS4409A) and MMAE linked 
through MC-VC-PABC.   
Comprehensive pharmacologic, PK, PD, and toxicological evaluations were undertaken to 
support the entry of DCDS4501A into clinical  trials.  Because DCDS4501A specifically 
recognizes CD79b on B cells of human but not on those of cynomolgus monkey, rat, or 
mouse, a surrogate ADC (DCDS5017A) that binds to cynomolgus monkey CD79b was generated to assess the antigen-dependent pharmacological, toxicological, and PK/PD activities in cynomolgus monkeys.  The structure, binding epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], and binding affinity of the surrogate ADC are similar to those of DCDS4501A.

CLL  = chronic lymphocytic leukemia; DLBCL  = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 
FL  = follicular lymphoma; MCL  = mantle cell lymphoma; MFI  = mean fluorescence intensity; 
MZL  = marginal zone lymphoma.  
CD79b expression levels (MFI) on B-cell tumor cells were assessed by [CONTACT_766208] B-cell lymphomas:  CLL (n  = 49), DLBCL (n  = 59), FL (n  = 58), 
MCL (n  = 20), and MZL (n  = 60). 
 
DCDS4501A bound human CD79b with high affinity (K d = 1.83±  0.26 nM); the surrogate 
ADC also showed similar high binding affinity to cynomolgus monkey CD79b.  
DCDS4501A displayed potent and selective inhibiti on of tumor cell proliferation in vitro 
(IC50 = 0.071 nM  ± 0.01 nM) in cell viability assays.  Moderate ADCC but no CDC activity 
was observed with the unconjugated clinical candidate antibody MCDS4409A.  Both clinical and surrogate unconjugated antibodies showed no appreciable cytokine release when evaluated in in vitro cytokine release assays with PBMCs.  Moderate elevations 
in interleukin (IL)-1 α and interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10 were observed only with the 
unconjugated clinical antibody, however the clinical significance of these observations are not known because IL-1 α and IP-10 are not produced by B cells, are not involved in 
B-cell signaling through CD79b, and are not associated with cytokine-release syndromes in vivo. 
Single intravenous (IV) doses of DCDS4501A resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in 
murine xenograft models of lymphoma.  Tumor regression was observed at doses 
ranging from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg.  In contrast, MCDS4409A showed no activity.  DCDS4501A administered at 5 mg/kg demonstrated better anti-tumor activity compared to a current standard-of-care regimen (rituximab plus cy clophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
and prednisone [R-CHOP]) in xenograft models of  NHL.  PD studies demonstrated that 
doses of the surrogate ADC ranging from 0.3 to 5 mg/kg resulted in a decrease of 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
49/P GO27834-A3 peripheral blood B cells in cynomolgus monkeys.   A preferential decrease of proliferating 
B cells (CD20+ Ki67+) compared to the resting B cells (CD20+ Ki67−) ) by [CONTACT_766211], in line with the expected mechanism of 
action of an anti-mitotic agent, MMAE. 
Due to B cell− mediated CL, non-linear pharmacokinetics were observed with the 
surrogate ADC in cynomolgus monkeys following single IV doses of 0.3 −3 mg/kg or four 
doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg given q3w.  The total antibody exposure after the fourth dose 
increased approximately 1.2- to 1.5-fold compared to the first dose.  As expected, the 
toxicokinetic profile of the clinical ADC in rats and cynomolgus monkeys was linear in the tested dose range.  Consistent with the half-life of the clinical ADC, minimal accumulation was observed following weekly dosing in rats and no accumulation was observed following q3w dosing in cynomolgus  monkeys.  The free MMAE concentrations 
in plasma following administration of the clinical or surrogate ADCs were generally low and overall did not exceed 2 ng/mL, regardless of dose.  The overall incidence of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) was 20% −67% following administration of the clinical 
or surrogate ADCs in cynomolgus monkeys; however, the ATAs did not appear to impact 
the toxicokinetic/PK parameter estimates. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, DCDS4501A and 
the surrogate ADC were well tolerated in monkeys up to doses of 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg respectively, with 3 mg/kg considered the HNSTD.  In rats, DCDS4501A was well tolerated up to 6 mg/kg (STD
10 = 10 mg/kg).  The predominant antigen-independent 
findings associated with DCDS4501A or surrogate ADC exposure were reversible bone marrow toxicity and associated peripheral blood cell effects in both monkeys and rats.  Administration of the surrogate ADC to monkeys also resulted in expected antigen-dependent reversible decreases in peripheral blood B cells and the disappearance of B-cell germinal centers in splenic lymphoid follicles at doses ≥
 3 mg/kg.  
Additional findings observed in rats but not in monkeys included thymic lymphoid depletion at ≥
 6 mg/kg, minimal to mild liver toxicities (at ≥ 6 mg/kg), lung toxicities at 
10 mg/kg in male animals only, and a slight increase in apoptosis and mitoses in multiple tissues, including skin and adnexa.  Hepatobiliary toxicity consisted of transient dose-dependent liver enzyme elevations accompanied by [CONTACT_766282]-dependent increases in mitotic figures/apoptosis in hepatocytes, sinusoidal cells, and bile duct epi[INVESTIGATOR_766120]-dependent random focal hepatic necrosis.  Pulmonary toxicity was characterized by [CONTACT_766282]-dependent alveolar macrophage infiltration, sometimes accompanied by [CONTACT_766283]/hypertr ophy.  These findings were consistent with 
the expected pharmacologic effect of MMAE on inducing mitotic arrest due to inhibition of tubulin polymerization.  Except for two individual instances (one female given 10 mg/kg in the liver and one male given 10 mg/kg in the lung), these findings were completely reversible after a 6-week recovery period.

[IP_ADDRESS] DCDS4501A Clinical Data 
a. Patient Enrollment 
Both DCDS4501A monotherapy and combination therapy with rituximab are being 
studied in a Phase I study (Study DCS4968g) of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies expected to express CD79b, including indolent NHL, DLBCL, MCL, and CLL.   
All data presented herein is based on a data entry cutoff of 28 February 2013, with 
clinical data available from 60 patients with NHL (excluding patients with CLL) enrolled in dose-escalation and expansion cohorts.  These include 51 patients who were treated with single-agent DCDS4501A ranging from 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg administered intravenously 
every 21 days and 9 patients who were enrolled into a single Phase Ib cohort with DCDS4501A administered at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg in combination with 375 mg/m
2 
rituximab. 
In the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, two DLTs were reported at the single-agent dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.   Enrollment into the CLL cohorts was stopped on 7 January 2013.  Refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure for details regarding clinical data in CLL patients.   
b. Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of DCDS4501A were characterized in the Phase I Study DCDS4501A.  DCDS4501A was administered in patients with NHL at escalating doses of 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg q3w as monotherapy and following administration of rituximab in the Phase Ib cohort.  Three analytes were quantified:  acMMAE, total antibody, and free MMAE.  
Preliminary PK analysis based on available data as of 22 June 2012 is summarized 
below.  The CL estimates of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level is in the 
range of 14.9–21.2 mL/day/kg and 7.12–27.9 mL/day/kg, respectively.  CL estimates 
were similar across doses of 0.1–2.4 mg/kg tested, suggesting dose-proportional increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposure.  The CL of acMMAE was faster than 
that of total antibody at each dose level.   
The mean value of V
ss of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level ranged from 
61 to 80.8 mL/kg and from 59.4 to 114.3 mL/kg, respectively, across the dose levels 
tested, which approximated human serum volume.  V ss values did not appear to change 
substantially with dose.  The half-lives for acMMAE and total antibody are from 2.4 to 
5.5 days and 2.9 to 7 days, respectively.  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
51/P GO27834-A3 In a single-agent dose-escalation study, for acMMAE and total antibody, the time to 
maximum concentration occurred immediately after infusion.  For free MMAE, the time to maximum concentration was approximately 2 to 3 days after infusion.  C
max and AUC inf of 
free MMAE appear increased with dose across the dose levels.  A half-life of 3–4 days for free MMAE was observed, which is relatively long and similar to acMMAE and suggests formation rate −limited kinetics for free MMAE.  No accumulation of free MMAE 
is expected for the q3w regimen.  The C
max values of free MMAE in NHL patients were at 
least 100-fold lower compared with acMMA E concentrations at each dose level, 
suggesting a slow release of free MMAE from acMMAE and potentially fast elimination once it is formed.   
Preliminary comparisons of pharmacokinetics between patients with NHL and CLL (for 
which patients are enrolled into separate dose-escalation cohorts) treated with identical doses of DCDS4501A provide some insight into t he factors that affect pharmacokinetics.  
Both acMMAE and total antibody were cleared faster in CLL patients than in NHL patients.  This observation is likely to be related to the high number of circulating B cells generally observed in CLL patients, which may result in significant target-mediated CL of DCDS4501A.  The free MMAE exposure in CLL patients was relatively low compared with that of its parent conjugate. 
To date, PK data for patients treated with DCDS4501A in combination with rituximab is 
limited.  Consequently, full comparison wi th single-agent DCDS4501A pharmacokinetics 
is not possible.  On the basis of very limited data from 3 patients, total antibody pharmacokinetics was comparable between 2.4 mg/kg of DCDS4501A administered as a single agent and following rituximab administration, suggesting that when given in combination, rituximab does not affect the pharmacokinetics of DCDS4501A; the effect of DCDS4501A on rituximab pharmacokinetics will be assessed.   
All observations will be verified with additional data from the ongoing Phase I study as 
well as this study.

c. Safety 
Dose-Limiting Toxicities  
Study DCS4968g utilizes a standard 3  + [ADDRESS_1050742] dose of DCDS4501A.  Any patient who did not complete the DLT observation period for any reason other t han 
a DLT was replaced. 
DLT of Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient out of 10 DLT-evaluable patients in the 
2.4 mg/kg single-agent cohort and 1 patient out of 9 DLT-evaluable patients in the 2.4 mg/kg +  rituximab cohort.  Doses of DCDS4501A greater than 2.4 mg/kg as 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
52/P GO27834-A3 monotherapy or in combination with rituximab were not assessed.  Consequently, 
DCDS4501A at 2.4 mg/kg was therefore determined to be the RP2D as both monotherapy and in combination with rituximab.   
In the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, two DLTs were reported at the single-agent dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.  One patient had a Grade 4 neutropenia, and 1 patient had a Grade 4 invasive fungal infection.   
Single-Agent DCDS4501A and DCDS4501A Combined with Rituximab  
Fifty-two  patients received single-agent DCDS4501A at a starting dose of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg 
(6 at 1.8 mg/kg, 45 at 2.4 mg/kg); an additional 9 patients received DCDS4501A at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg in combination with rituximab.  Overall, the safety profile of DCDS4501A combined with rituximab did not differ from that of single-agent DCDS4501A. 
Treatment-emergent hematologic and commonly reported non-hematologic adverse 
events of all grades in patients treated with single-agent DCDS4501A and DCDS4501A plus rituximab included neutropenia (50%), febrile neutropenia (5%), infection (system organ class; 35%), anemia (13%), thrombocytopenia (18%), peripheral neuropathy (32%), diarrhea (43%), pyrexia (37%), nausea (35%), and fatigue (18%).  Treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included neutropenia (43%), febrile 
neutropenia (5%), infection (system organ class; 10%), anemia (8%), peripheral neuropathy (7%), diarrhea (3%), pyrexia (2%), and fatigue (5%).   Serious adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_766215]4501A were reported in 20% of patients.   Dose discontinuations for adverse events were reported in 33% of patients. 
Refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator’s Brochure for complete and updated details 
related to safety.   
d. Efficacy 
Investigator-based objective responses were observed in 28 of 49 (57%) patients trea ted 
with single-agent DCDS4501A and 7 of 9 patients (78%) treated with DCDS4501A combined with rituximab.  Among patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, objective responses were observed in 16 of 30 (53%; 4 CR, 12 PR) patients treated with DCDS4501A; 1 patient with DLBCL was treated with DCDS4501A combined with rituximab and achieved a PR.  Among patients with relapsed or refractory iNHL, objective responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%; 2 CR, 5 PR) patients treated with single-agent DCDS4501A and 5 of 5 (100%; 2 CR, 3 PR) patients treated with DCDS4501A plus rituximab.

53/P GO27834-A3 1.2.3 Rituximab  
Rituximab has been shown to be an effective treatment for CD20-positive B-cell 
malignancies and is commonly used both as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Rituximab binds  to CD20, a hydrophobic, transmembrane 
protein that is present on pre–B cells and mature B cells and in ≥ 90% of B-cell NHLs.  
It exerts its cytotoxic effects via complem ent-mediated B-cell lysis, ADCC, and induction 
of apoptosis (Cartron et al. 2004). 
In the [LOCATION_002], rituximab has been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the following indications in NHL:  as a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive B-cell NHL; for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive B-cell NHL, including initia l treatment weekly for eight doses and 
re-treatment (weekly for four doses) in patients who responded to an initial course of rituximab; for the treatment of low-grade, CD20-positive B-cell NHL, in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) induction chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with follicular, CD20-positive NHL; as treatment in previously untreated patients with low- grade, CD20-positive NHL who achieve an 
objective response or stable disease (SD) following CVP induction; and as maintenance therapy for previously untreated follicular CD20-positive B-cell NHL after achieving a 
response to a regimen including chemotherapy and rituximab. 
In the European Union, rituximab (MabThera
®) is approved for the treatment of the 
following indications in NHL:  treatment of patients with Stage III–IV follicular NHL who 
are chemotherapy-resistant or in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy; treatment of patients with CD20-positive DLBCL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy; as front-line therapy in Stage III–IV follicular NHL in combination with CVP chemotherapy; as maintenance therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory, follicular NHL responding to induction treatment with CHOP or R-CHOP; and as maintenance treatment for patients with FL who have responded to initial treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy. 
Rituximab has also been approved for the treatment of CLL.  The European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) granted an approval for the use of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated CLL.  The FDA approved the use of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for patients with previously untreated and previously treated CD20-positive CLL.   
Refer to the Rituximab Investigator’s Brochure  for complete details regarding clinical data 
related to approved indications.  For rituximab safety information, refer to local rituximab 
prescribing information.

54/P GO27834-A3 1.2.4 Obinutuzumab  
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Mechanism of Action 
Obinutuzumab ([G], also known as RO5072759, GA101, Gazyva ™, and Gazyvaro ™) is a 
humanized type II and glycoengineered anti-CD20 MAb, derived by [CONTACT_766284] B-Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent glycoengineering leading to the 
following characteristics (Mössner et al. 2010; Golay et al. 2013): 
• High-affinity binding to CD20 antigen on B cells 
• Type II binding mode to the CD20 antigen, leading to a more even distribution of 
bound antibody to the surface membrane of the B cell due to lack of CD20 
translocation into lipid rafts after antibody binding and low complement activation 
and low complement-dependent cytotoxicity related to the recognition of the CD20 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]  
• Compared with the type I anti-CD20 antibodies rituximab or ofatumumab, increased 
ADCC and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) related to an improved binding of obinutuzumab to the different allotypes of Fc γRIIIa and Fc γRIIIb  
expressed by [CONTACT_113921] (NK) ce lls , monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils 
• Compared with rituximab, increased direct cell-death induction related to an elbow 
hinge amino exchange of the Fab region and type II binding of the CD20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_766149] 2013 and EMA approval in 
July 2014 on the basis of the CLL-11 Study BO21004 for patients with relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.  Obinutuzumab plus  chlorambucil showed superiority over 
rituximab plus chlorambucil in all efficacy parameters such as overall response rate (ORR), complete remission rate (CRR), minimal residual disease (MRD), progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS), and duration of response 
(DOR) (Goede et al. 2014). 
Obinutuzumab is currently being explored in  the treatment of lymphoid malignancies 
such as aggressive and indolent lymphomas (DLBCL, FL, and marginal zone lymphoma 
[MZL]).  Preliminary data suggest possible increased anti-lymphoma efficacy over 
rituximab, a hypothesis that is currently  being explored in several randomized trials, 
including a Phase III study of R-CHOP versus G-CHOP in first-line treatment of DLBCL, a Phase III study of R-chemotherapy (CHO P, CVP, or bendamustine) followed by 
[CONTACT_766218] G-chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine) followed by [CONTACT_766285]-line treatment of FL and MZL, and a 
Phase III study of obinutuzumab combined with bendamustine compared with bendamustine in patients with rituximab-refractory indolent NHL. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology of obinutuzumab has been evaluated in repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys given week ly IV (30-minute infusion) up to 26 weeks in duration 
and weekly SC injections for 4 weeks in duration.  The high dose of 50 mg/kg in the 26-week study resulted in a steady-state area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
55/P GO27834-A3 24 hours (AUC 0−24) exposure of 341,000 μ g•hr/mL, which is approximately 61-fold above 
that of the clinical exposure of 5584 μg•hr/mL. 
Consistent with expected pharmacologic activity, obinutuzumab caused marked 
decreases in B cells, with corresponding lymphoid depletion in spleen and lymph nodes.  Circulating CD40-positive mature B cells began to reverse after several months without treatment and maximally reversed to 7% −152% of baseline by 37 weeks.  In addition, 
transient decreases in NK cells were observed; this finding is consistent with the pharmacologic effect of Fc γRIIIa binding.  Suspected opportunistic infections in as many 
as three unscheduled deaths were considered a possible secondary result of B-cell depletion. 
Obinutuzumab was immunogenic in the cynomolgus monkey, which led to reduced 
systemic exposures in several animals and abrogation of the pharmacologic activity.  Hypersensitivity reactions were noted that included systemic inflammation and infiltrates consistent with immune complex −mediated hypersensitivity reactions such as 
arteritis/periarteritis, glomerulonephritis, and serosal/adventitial inflammation and led to unscheduled termination in six animals. 
Both the clinical IV formulation and the SC formulation of obinutuzumab were locally well 
tolerated across studies.  No effects were present in male and female reproductive parameters included in the 26-week IV dose study.  No obinutuzumab-related effects were observed on CNS, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or cardiovascular function. 
In vitro assays using undiluted human whole blood measured significant increases in 
cytokine secretion caused by [CONTACT_766286], indicating that obinutuzumab has an increased propensity to trigger first infusion −related cytokine release in patients. 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Efficacy 
Obinutuzumab has in vivo efficacy superio r to rituximab in various human lymphoma 
xenograft models.  Both antibodies were tested in human SUDHL-4 cells (DLBCL model) injected subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice.  Rituximab administration was started when tumors were established and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_8320].  Results showed that rituximab at  10 mg/kg inhibited tumor growth compared 
with rituximab at 1 mg/kg; however, increasing the rituximab dose to 30 mg/kg did not result in increased efficacy and rituximab was not able to achieve complete tumor regression.  In contrast, obinutuzumab showed a dose-dependent increase in efficacy in the range of 1− 30 mg/kg.  Results showed complete tumor regression in all animals and 
lasting tumor eradication in [ADDRESS_1050743] dose of 30 mg/kg and in 1 of 10 animals at a dose of 10 mg/kg. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
56/P GO27834-A3 In another experiment, SUDHL4 xenografts in SCID mice were first treated with weekly 
rituximab 30 mg/kg.  When the tumors became refractory to rituximab (Day 35), rituximab treatment was continued or changed to either weekly vehicle control or obinutuzumab 30 mg/kg.  While tumors in control- and rituximab-treated mice continued to grow, obinutuzumab-treated mice showed control of tumor growth and lived until Day [ADDRESS_1050744] also shown similar results, with obinutuzumab treatment 
controlling tumor growth, whereas vehicle- and rituximab-treated tumors were not controlled ( Mössner et al. 2010). 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Clinical Experience 
As of July 2013, more than [ADDRESS_1050745] been treated with obinutuzumab in clinical trials.  Clinical data for obinutuzumab are available from six clinical trials, including three Phase I and Phase II studies of obinutuzumab monotherapy, a Phase Ib chemotherapy combination study in NHL (Study BO21000), and two Phase III studies (Study BO21004 in CLL and Study GAO4753g in NHL). 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs), mostly Grades [ADDRESS_1050746] 
infusion, generally occurring early during the infusion, shortly after the infusion, or, in some cases, up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion.  In a few patients, concurrent signs of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were observed.  The incidence and intensity of IRRs decreased strongly with subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab.  On the basis of preliminary observations, extensive tumor burden, tumor factors, and host factors may be predisposing factors for the occurrence of IRRs.  The frequency and severity of IRRs is also reduced in lymphomas compared with CLL. 
Other frequently observed adverse events include infections and neutropenia.  
Grade 3−[ADDRESS_1050747] been 
reported with obinutuzumab, associated predominantly with treatment of CLL rather than NHL.  Given its anticipated mode of action, which results in profound B-cell depletion, obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections during and after treatment. 
Data from Study BO20999 (obinutuzumab m onotherapy) showed safety and efficacy of 
single-agent obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed indolent and aggressive 
lymphomas.  Responses were seen at both lower (400 mg) and higher (1600/800 mg) doses, although responses increased at the higher dose, with 54% of patients with indolent lymphoma and 32% of patients with aggressive lymphomas showing PR or CR 
at the end of treatment (EOT) (Morschhauser et al. 2013; Salles et al. 2013).   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
57/P GO27834-A3 Study BO21000 (Phase Ib) evaluated obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy:  
obinutuzumab with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and obinutuzumab with CHOP (Radford et al. 2013).  Both chemotherapy combinations were shown to be feasible in patients with previously untreated or relapsed or refractory FL, with response rates of >
 90% for both regimens.  Safety was acceptable, with no new or unexpected adverse 
events observed.  The most common adverse event was neutropenia. 
Data from obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in CLL (Phase III 
Study BO21004) showed increased efficacy of this combination over rituximab-chlorambucil, with a hazard ratio of 0.39 for PFS.  IRRs were common (65% all grades, 20% Grade 3− 4, no fatal IRRs) and neutropenia occurred at increased 
frequency with the combination therapy (33% Grade 3 −5), but there was no increase in 
infections or treatment-related deaths (Goede et al. 2014). 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on the clinical 
studies. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Pharmaco kinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
A two-compartment model comprising a time-varying CL pathway and a linear CL pathway provides an adequate description of the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab following IV administration in Study BO20999 and Study BO21003.  Following the 
infusion of obinutuzumab, the elimination appears to be characterized by a linear CL pathway that is dependent on time (i.e., starting at a typi[INVESTIGATOR_27797] 630 mL/day and then gradually decreasing to an asymptote of 60 mL/day at steady state).  Tumor burden 
may potentially contribute significantly to the CL of obinutuzumab, especially at the beginning of treatment when CD20-positive tumor cells are most abundant.  As tumor burden decreases, the CL reaches an asymptote, which is considered to be primarily a function of the proteolytic metabolic CL.  Some patients with a high tumor burden may appear to clear the drug from the plasma faster than patients with a low tumor burden because obinutuzumab binds to the CD20-pos itive tumor cells and is effectively 
removed from the plasma.  The CL of the drug will vary with time because repeated treatments with obinutuzumab will reduce the quantity of CD20-positive tumor cells.  The number of times obinutuzumab is administered during the first cycle of treatment may be expected to reduce the number of CD20-positive tumor cells, thus minimizing the impact of the time-varying CL pathway on obinutuzumab exposure. 
Treatment with obinutuzumab resulted in ext ensive B-cell depletion, with all patients 
showing a reduction in B-cell counts to absolute zero at some stage of their treatment 
cycle.  Overall, there has been no notable increase in complement levels before and after infusion, but transient increases occurring during the administration of obinutuzumab have been observed in the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α, 
interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)- γ.

58/P GO27834-A3 1.3 RATIONALE FOR DOING THIS STUDY 
The goals of this study are to continue to assess the safety, tolerability, and biologic and 
clinical activity of the combinations of DCDT2980S and rituximab and DCDS4501A and rituximab in two specific NHL patient populations:  patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.  An additional goal of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and potential biologic and clinical activity of DCDS4501A in combination with obinutuzumab, an anti-CD20 antibody, in the aforementioned NHL patient populations.  These patients continue to have an extremely poor prognosis with no curative options available.  Consequently, new therapeutic options are needed.   
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab, and obinutuzumab each target antigens specific 
to B-cell malignancies including follicular NHL and DLBCL (see Figures 1 and 2).  
The randomized component of the Phase II study design permits an assessment of the 
clinical benefit provided by [CONTACT_766220], which has established clinical activity in B- cell malignancies both as monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy.  Data from this study will help inform the feasibility of the combination regimens in earlier lines of therapy (e.g., as first-line therapy in newly diagnosed patients).   
The non-randomized component of the study will further evaluate the safety and 
tolerability and clinical activity of DCDS4501A in combination with obinutuzumab in 
patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma or DLBCL and will also provide preliminary evidence as to which anti-CD20 agent, rituximab or obinutuzumab, in combination with DCDS4501A, provides a better benefit-risk profile in the target population being studied.  
The feasibility of combining an ADC with ritu ximab has previously been tested clinically 
with the combination of another, different CD22-specific ADC, inotuzumab ozogamicin 
(CMC-544), with results suggesting that the addition of rituximab may have increased 
clinical activity without significant increase in toxicity over the ADC alone in patients with aggressive NHL (Fayad et al. 2006; Nam et al. 2009; Nina et al. 2010).  As noted in 
Section 1.2.[ADDRESS_1050748] acceptable safety in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL in the Phase I studies (Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g).   
Given the relatively poor prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic 
malignancies that have failed standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the nonclinical toxicity profile associated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A treatm ent, and the clinical safety profile 
observed to date for both ADCs, the benefit-risk ratio of a clinical study of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, each combined with rituximab or obinutuzumab, is considered acceptable.

59/P GO27834-A3 1.3.1 Rationale for Assessing ADC Dose of 1.8 mg/kg Combined with 
Rituximab in iNHL  
On the basis of available Phase I data (see Section 1.2.1 and Section 1.2.2), both 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A as single agents and combined with rituximab have shown early signs of clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory NHL.  However, early evidence in the Phase I studies indicate that duration of 
study treatment may be limited by [CONTACT_766221].  Specifically, for both ADCs, peripheral sensory neuropathy has been identified as a known risk (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Notably, [ADDRESS_1050749] shown single-agent activity at the 1.8 mg/kg dose level (Advani et al. 2012; Palanca-Wessels et al. 2012), the purpose of enrolling additional cohorts of patients with FL is to determine whether lower doses of ADC in combination with standard doses of rituximab result in improved tolerability while maintaining efficacy in FL.   
In contrast to iNHL, treatment paradigms in relapsed or refractory aggressive 
lymphomas such as DLBCL continue to place a premium on anti-tumor activity and 
higher tolerance for treatment-related toxicity, given that the duration of disease control 
and survival are substantially shorter and that  treatment options are extremely limited.  
Early Phase I data suggest lower rates of study treatment discontinuation for adverse 
events among patients with DLBCL compared with patients with iNHL.  Taken together with anti-tumor activity observed to date, the benefit-risk profile of the currently tested 
ADC dose of 1.8 mg/kg is considered acceptable to combine with rituxminab in the 
treatment of patients with iNHL.   
1.3.2 Rationale for Assessing DCD S4501A in Combination with 
Obinutuzumab in Relapsed or Refractory NHL  
The development of next-generation anti-CD20 −directed therapy may further enhance 
the efficacy of current standard regimens for NHL.  Obinutuzumab, also known as 
RO5072759, GA101, and Gazyva ™/Gazyvaro ™, a novel type II and glycoengineered 
anti-CD20 antibody, has shown superiority over rituximab in a Phase III trial in first-line 
CLL (Goede et al. 2014).  Obinutuzumab is currently being compared with rituximab in two large Phase III studies in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL (Study BO21005) and with previously untreated iNHL, including FL (Study BO21223).  Assuming these studies demonstrate greater clinical benefit with obinutuzumab- vs. rituximab-containing regimens, potentially altering the standard of care in NHL, it will be important to also assess the safety and efficacy of combining DCDS4501A with obinutuzumab-containing regimens.

DCDS4501A  
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomized Portion of the Study (Arms A and B)  − Closed to 
Enrollment  
Following determination of eligibility, patients within each disease group will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments: 
• Arm A:  Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S (2.4 mg/kg) every 21 days; 
• Arm B:  Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A (2.4 mg/kg) every [ADDRESS_1050750] to the 
following stratification factors: 
• For patients with FL (see Section 3.1.4 for definitions) 
Rituximab refractory disease ( no response or disease relapse <  [ADDRESS_1050751] rituximab treatment) versus rituximab relapsed disease (disease relapse 
after response ≥  [ADDRESS_1050752] rituximab treatment) 
• For patients with DLBCL (see Section 3.1.5 for definitions) 
Second-line versus third-line (or beyond) therapy 
For second-line patients, disease relapse or no objective response (CR, 
unconfirmed CR [CRu], or PR) <12 months from the start of initial therapy versus disease relapse, after initial objective response (CR, unconfirmed response 
[CRu] or PR), ≥  [ADDRESS_1050753]-line patients, failure to achieve a CR or progression < [ADDRESS_1050754] recent therapy versus CR or progression ≥ [ADDRESS_1050755] recent therapy 
No formal testing comparing the two treatment arms in the randomized portion of the study is planned. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Randomized Portion of the Study with Rituximab 
(Cohorts C and D)  − Closed to Enrollment  
Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the non-randomized portion of the study will enroll patients into these cohorts. 
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled in Cohorts C and D to 
receive rituximab (375 mg/m
2) combined with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A at a dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.  The first day of treatment constitutes Day 1 of each cycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766116] 21 days in duration. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
65/P GO27834-A3 The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s discretion and only after 
the enrollment of patients with FL into the randomized portion of the study is completed.  Patients will not be randomized to receive one treatment or the other.  It is anticipated that Cohort C and D will be opened sequentially.   
3.1.2 All Patients  on Rituximab-Containing Arms/Cohorts   
All patients on rituximab-containing regimens, regardless of assigned arm/cohort, will receive DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab administered by [CONTACT_766203] a 21-day cycle.  For the first two cycles, rituximab will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 1 and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 2.  In the absence of any infusion-related adverse events, rituximab and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent cycles beginning with the third cycle.  In this instance, rituximab will be administered first, 
followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S or DCDS4501A.  In certain circumstances
⎯for example, IRRs 
requiring interruption or slowing of infusion rate ⎯rituximab may be administered over 
2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the cycle); in this case, DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A 
may be administered on Day 2 following completion of the rituximab infusion or on Day 3 of the cycle. 
Patients may receive treatments for up to 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day 
schedule) if not discontinued because of significant toxicity, disease progression, or withdrawal from study. 
Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the Schedules 
of Assessments outlined in Appendices A-1, A-2, and A-4.  Initial response assessments 
in this study will be performed every 3 months  from the initiation of therapy until study 
treatment completion or early termination (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1050756] eight  21-day cycles of treatment).  Additional 
response assessments for patients who proceed to crossover treatment (see Section 3.1.6) will be performed as described in Appendix A-2; response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment (both initially assigned treatment and crossover treatment) for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as described in Appendix A-4. 
Responses to study treatment will be based on investigator assessments.  In addition, 
tumor assessment data will be transmitted to an Independent Review Facility (IRF) for collection and possible independent review. 
3.1.3 Obinutuzumab-Containi ng Regimen with DCDS4501A 
(Cohorts E, G, and H)  
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg will be given in combination with obinutuzumab to patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and DLBCL in two stages:  (1) safety run-in and (2) expansion. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
66/P GO27834-A3 Study treatment will be given in 21-day cy cles for both follicular NHL and DLBCL.  
Patients will be treated for up to a total of [ADDRESS_1050757] cycle, obinutuzumab will 
be administered by [CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, and 15.  DCDS4501A will be given on Day 2 for Cycle 1.  In the absence of any infusion-related adverse events, obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A may be administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent cycles beginning with the second cycle.  If obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A are administered on the same day, the study drugs will be given sequentially.  Obinutuzumab will be 
administered first, followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A.  In certain circumstances
⎯for example, 
IRRs requiring interruption or slowing of infusion rate ⎯obinutuzumab may be 
administered over 2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the cycle); in this case, DCDS4501A may be administered on Day 2 following completion of the obinutuzumab infusion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab-Containing Regi men in Phase Ib: Safety Run-In 
(Cohort E) 
This portion of the study will consist of a safety run-in that will evaluate the safety of DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in 6 patients (Cohort E).  The safety run-in is described in detail in Section 3.4.   
Obinutuzumab-Containing Regimens in Phase II:  Expansion Stage 
(Cohorts G and H) 
After the safety run-in has demonstrated that DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab is safe to administer, patients will be enrolled into two expansion cohorts based on histology of follicular NHL or DLBCL (Cohorts G and H, respectively).  
Forty patients will be enrolled into each expansion cohort.  An additional cohort(s) 
may be added in the future.  
3.1.4 Follicular NHL Patients  for Rituximab-Containing 
Arms/Cohorts  
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled into the study as defined by [CONTACT_716]: 
• Relapsed
 as documented history of response (CR, CRu, or PR) of ≥ 6 months in 
duration from completion of all prior  rituximab-containing regimens.  A 
rituximab-containing regimen is defined as rituximab as a single agent during 
induction and/or maintenance or in combination with other agents during induction 
and/or maintenance. 
• Refractory  to any prior  regimen containing rituximab, defined as no response to or 
progression within [ADDRESS_1050758] dose of rituximab therapy 
(either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy), including: 
Patients with progressive disease while receiving rituximab monotherapy, rituximab combined with chemotherapy, or rituximab maintenance therapy; 
patients must have received at least one full dose (375 mg/m
2) of rituximab. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
67/P GO27834-A3 Patients with no objective response (PR or CR) to a rituximab-containing regimen 
consisting of at least [ADDRESS_1050759] 4 cycles of rituximab combined with chemotherapy 
 
Enrollment of patients with refractory disease as defined above may be limited to no 
greater than 60% of the total follicular NHL cohort, in order to avoid overrepresentation of the refractory disease population. 
3.1.5 Follicular NHL Patients fo r Obinutuzumab-Containing Cohorts  
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled into the study as defined by [CONTACT_716]:

CRu, or PR) of ≥ 6 months in duration from completion of regimen(s)   
• Refractory  to any prior regimen, defined as no response to the prior therapy, or 
progression within [ADDRESS_1050760] dose of therapy 
 
3.1.6 DLBCL Patients for Ri tuximab-Containing Arms/Cohorts  
Patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are determined by [CONTACT_766193]-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue/stem cell transplant (SCT) will be enrolled into the study as defined by [CONTACT_716]: 
• Second-line SCT-ineligible patients with progressive disease or no response 
(SD) <

• Third-line (or beyond) SCT-ineligible patients with disease relapse after initial 
response ≥  6 months from start of prior therapy (third-line + relapsed ) 
 
Enrollment into any of the above four categories may be limited to no greater than 40% 
of the DLBCL cohort—and to no more than 60% of the two refractory categories combined—in order to avoid overrepresentation of any specific subpopulation, refractory patients in particular.

response ≥  6 months from start of prior therapy (third-line + relapsed ) 
 
3.1.8 Crossover Treatment (Randomized Patients in Arms A and B  
Only) 
Patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B who develop progressive disease may be 
eligible to receive crossover treatment consisting of rituximab and the other ADC or the other ADC alone ⎯for example, Arm B treatment for patients who have disease 
progression while receiving Arm A treatment, and vice versa ⎯provided the following 
conditions are met: 
• Patients must not have experienced a toxicity requiring the discontinuation of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment OR experienced toxicity during the last dose of 
study treatment that would preclude treatment with the crossover regimen. 
Patients who had modifications to dosing and/or schedule on the initial study treatment will be permitted to receive crossover treatment in the absence of 
toxicities on the modified dose and/or schedule.  The dose and schedule of 
crossover treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_33495]. 
Patients who had rituximab discontinued and continued on single-agent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment may receive crossover treatment of 
single-agent DCDS4501A/ DCDT2980S. 
• Patients must have radiographically documented disease progression. 
• Patients must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Section 4.1.1 
and Section 4.1.2, except for those related to prior rituximab treatment. 
• Acceptable toxicity:  All study drug–relat ed adverse events from the initial study 
treatment must have decreased to Grade [ADDRESS_1050761] 
day of treatment on the crossover regimen.  Exceptions may be allowed after a 
careful assessment and discussion of the benefit-risk balance with the patient by [CONTACT_766224]. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
69/P GO27834-A3 • Administration of crossover treatment must be in the best interests of the patient as 
determined after a careful assessment and discussion of benefit-risk balance with 
the patient by [CONTACT_766224]. 
• A tumor biopsy (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be required for patients with safely 
accessible site of disease, defined as requiring only local anesthesia and, in 
general, excluding the brain, lungs or any internal organs that may subject patients to significant risk.  
Patients for whom a safely accessible site of disease is not present may still receive crossover treatment without undergoi ng a biopsy.  Eligibility to receive 
crossover treatment should be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_1689]. 
A tumor biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease is optional for patients who 
are not eligible for study cross over.  
 
Patients who are determined to be eligible for study cross over will be treated as follows: 
• Assessments obtained at the initial study treatment discontinuation visit 
(see Section 4.5.4) may be used as screening assessments for crossover treatment.  
The following re-screening assessments must be repeated/obtained within 1 week 
prior to starting treatment on the crossover regimen, in order to re-establish baseline 
pretreatment clinical and disease status:  targeted physical exam, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, and hematology and serum chemistry 
laboratory tests. 
Re-screening tests for hepatitis B and C do not need to be performed unless there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_136701] B and/or C positivity. 
A radiographic tumor assessment must also be performed, unless already done 
to document disease progression, within 6 weeks prior to starting crossover 
treatment. 
• Crossover treatment will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1050762] dose of the prior 
study treatment. 
 
Patients will be treated with the crossover treatment until a second disease progression 
event relative to the tumor assessment, documenting progressive disease on the initial study treatment, clinical deterioration, and/or intolerance to the crossover treatment for up to a maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule).  Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules of assessments outlined in Appendices A-2.  Response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment 
for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as described in Appendix A-4 .  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
70/P GO27834-A3 Clinical data and exploratory data derived from tumor biopsies obtained prior to 
crossover treatment will be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Genentech has the right to restrict or suspend enrollment into crossover treatment at any time.  Reasons for this may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The incidence or severity of adverse events during crossover treatment indicates a 
potential safety hazard to patients. 
• Patient enrollment into crossover treatment is unsatisfactory. 
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.  • Patients who are enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C, 
D, E, G, and H) will not have the option to receive crossover treatment upon 
disease progression (see Section 3.2 for rationale). 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1050763] study treatment and following progressive disease will provide further understanding of disease biology, possible mechanisms of resistance to the study treatment, and initial insights into tumor subtypes based on tumor biomarkers that are sensitive to study treatment.  Finally , the inclusion of study treatment crossover 
(see Section 3.1.8) will address important questions regarding efficacy and tolerability of a second ADC-rituximab combination following disease progression on the initial ADC-rituximab combination.  
The primary rationale for the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and D) is 
to assess the therapeutic index (i.e., the balance of efficacy and tolerability of 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL).  An informal comparison between patients with follicular NHL treated at the two doses of the ADC will help determine if tolerability is improved at the lower ADC dose without substantial compromise of efficacy.  
The clinical feasibility of an ADC-rituximab combination regimen in patients with relapsed 
or refractory NHL has been previously studied.  Results from studies of rituximab in 
combination with a different CD22-specific ADC, inotuzumab ozogamicin, demonstrated that when combined with rituximab, the ADC was able to be given at the single-agent 
MTD without the need for dose reduction of the ADC because of the lack of significant 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171] (Fayad et al. 2006; Nam et al. 2009; Nina et al. 2010). 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A were both evaluated as single agents and in combination 
with rituximab in the Phase I studies Study DCT4862g and Study DCS4968g, 
respectively.  Results from these trials have determined an MTD of 2.4 mg/kg for 
single-agent DCDT2980S and an RP2D of 2.4 mg/kg for single-agent DCDS4501A in 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
71/P GO27834-A3 patients with mixed NHL.  In addition, the RP2D of DCT2980S and DCDS4501 each in 
combination with rituximab (375 mg/m2) on an every-21-day schedule was determined to 
be 2.4 mg/kg.   
Study GO27834 will continue to assess the cumulative safety and longer-term tolerability 
of ADC-rituximab combination therapy.  Due to additional information about the benefit-risk 
profile of DCDS4501A at the 2.4 mg/kg dose, th e Sponsor is no longer pursuing the 2.4 mg/kg 
dose of DCDS4501A in the obinutuzumab-containing cohorts.  
The primary rationale for the non-randomized Phase Ib/II obinutuzumab-containing 
cohorts (Cohorts E −H) is to assess safety and clinical activity for the combination of 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL (Cohorts E, G, and H).  Obinutuzumab (also known as RO5072759, GA101 and Gazyva™ /Gazyvaro ™), 
a novel type II and glycoengineered anti-CD20 antibody, has shown superiority over rituximab in a Phase III trial in first-line CLL (Goede et al. 2014).  Obinutuzumab is currently being compared with rituximab in two large Phase III studies in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL (Study BO21005) and previously untreated iNHL, including FL (Study BO21223).  Assuming these studies demonstrate greater clinical benefit with obinutuzumab- vs. rituximab-containing regimens, potentially altering the standard of 
care in NHL, it will be important to also assess the safety and efficacy of combining DCDS4501A with obinutuzumab-containing regimens. 
Study drug dosing will occur on Days 1 or 2 of each 21-day (or 28-day) cycle to allow for 
recovery from potential bone marrow toxicity. 
3.2.[ADDRESS_1050764] of peripheral B-cell counts, tumor burden, and target antigen expression on target -mediated drug CL over multiple doses 
of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A plus rituximab or obinutuzumab when the two drugs are given in combination, the drug levels of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A-related analytes and rituximab or obinutuzumab will be assessed in this combination study.   
In Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, single-agent DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A 
administered by [CONTACT_33433] 21 days we re evaluated at doses ranging from 0.1 to 
3.2 mg/kg for DCDT2980S and 0.1 mg/kg to 2.4 mg/kg for DCDS4501A in patients with NHL.  Intensive PK sampling of all patients in the ongoing Phase I studies will provide sufficient data to allow complete profiling of the distribution and elimination phases for DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A and the investigation of potential correlations between various PK parameters and efficacy and/or toxicity.  Consequently a reduced PK sampling scheme of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A will be used in this study.  
The PK data collected in this study will allow further characterization of the PK properties 
of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  In addition, the DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A concentration results from this study will be compared with available data from the 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
72/P GO27834-A3 single-agent clinical studies to evaluate whether concurrent administration of rituximab 
affects the exposure of DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A.   
Rituximab serum concentration measurements from this study will be compared with 
PK data from historical rituximab clinical studies to evaluate whether the combination 
with DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A affects the pharmacokinetics of rituximab.  
Limited sampling of serum concentrations of obinutuzumab will be assessed and 
compared with historical data to evaluate potential PK interactions with DCDS4501A. 
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES 
3.3.1 Safety Outcome Measures  
The safety and tolerability of the combination of DCDT2980S and rituximab and 
DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab will be assessed using the following safety 
outcome measures: 
• Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events 
• Incidence of anti-DCDT2980S, anti-DCDS4501A, or anti-obinutuzumab 
antibodies 
• Changes in vital signs 
• Changes in laboratory values 
  
3.3.2 Pharmacokinetic/Pharm acodynamic Outcome Measures  
The following PK parameters will be derived from the serum concentration–time profiles 
of total antibody (the sum of conjugated and unconjugated antibody), including rituximab or obinutuzumab, and plasma concentration-time profiles of acMMAE and free MMAE following administration of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A, when appropriate, as data allow: 
• Total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) 
• Maximum plasma and serum concentration (C
max) 
• CL 
• Terminal half-life (t 1/2) 
• V ss 
 
Compartmental, non-compartmental, and/or population methods may be used.  Other 
parameters, such as accumulation ratio and trough plasma and serum concentration (C
min), may also be calculated. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
73/P GO27834-A3 The following PD outcome measures will be assessed when appropriate, as data allow:

measurements are taken, B-cell data will be listed for each patient by [CONTACT_766225]: 
Absolute blood cell counts 
Percent change relative to the baseline blood counts 
CD19+ B-cell recovery, defined as the timepoint when the values return to 
baseline levels or ≥ 50% of baseline levels 
• Assessment of the kinetics of circulating tumor DNA 
 
3.3.3 Activity Outcome Measures  
The following activity outcome measures will be assessed  for rituximab-containing 
arms/cohorts (Arms A and B, Cohort C) : 
• Objective response, defined as a PR or CR 
• Duration of objective response, defined as the duration of time from the first 
occurrence of a documented objective response to time of relapse or death from 
any cause 
• PFS, defined as the duration from randomization to the first occurrence of 
progression or death within [ADDRESS_1050765] 
• OS, defined as the duration from the date of randomization/enrollment to the date

Objective response and disease progression will be determined using standard criteria 
for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007, 2014; see Appendix C-1 and Appendix C-2).  
The following activity outcome measures wi ll be assessed for obinutuzumab-containing 
cohorts (Cohorts E, G, and H) according to Lugano 2014 Response Criteria (Cheson et al. 2014): 
The primary activity outcome measure will be assessed by:  
• CR at end of treatment (6
−[ADDRESS_1050766] dose of study medication) 
based on PET  alone, as determined by [CONTACT_766269]: 
• OR (CR or PR) at end of treatment based on PET alone as determined by [CONTACT_766189]  
• CR at end of treatment based on CT only, as determined by [CONTACT_648640]  
• OR (CR or PR) at end of treatment based on CT  only as determined by [CONTACT_766201]  
• BOR (CR or PR) while on study based on PET alone or CT only, as determined by [CONTACT_766287]:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
74/P GO27834-A3  
3.3.4 Exploratory Outcome Measures   
The exploratory outcome measures will include, but will not be limited to, the following:  
• Confirmation and quantitation of CD22, CD79b, and CD20 expression levels in 
either archival or freshly obtained (w hen available) tumor specimens (tumor 
biopsies, bone marrow biopsies, peripheral  blood) by [CONTACT_9064]/flow 
cytometry/quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
• Additional assessments related to the understanding of the mechanism of action of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab, and obinutuzumab, e.g., assessment of 
circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) to monitor response, mechanisms of resistance to DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab, and obinutuzumab, and/or NHL pathogenesis 
may be included. 
• Treatment and disease symptom assessments using the M.D. Anderson Symptom 
Inventory (MDASI)  in rituximab-containing cohorts only  
 
The following exploratory efficacy outcome measures will be assessed: 
• DOR, defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR or PR to 
the date of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause, for the subgroup of patients 
with a best overall response of CR or PR, b ased on PET and/or CT scans as determined by 
[CONTACT_766184].  For patients ac hieving a response who have not experienced 
disease progression, relapse, or died prior to the time of the analysis, the DOR will be 
censored on the date of last disease assessment. 
• PFS, defined as the time from date of randomization or first treatment (for G-containing 
arms) to the first occurrence of progression or relapse, or death from any cause , based on 
PET and/or CT scans as determined by [CONTACT_766184].

anti-lymphoma therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, based on PET 
and/or CT scans as determined by  [CONTACT_766184]  
• OS, defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause 
 
3.4 SAFETY PLAN  
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study. 
Safety will be evaluated through the monitoring of the following: 
• Serious adverse events that are attributed to protocol-mandated interventions from 
the time of signing of the Informed Consent Form until the first dose of study 
treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1 
• All adverse events from Cycle 1, Da y [ADDRESS_1050767] dose of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab, or obinutuzumab, whichever is later, including doses that were administered as part of crossover treatment 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
75/P GO27834-A3 • All serious adverse events from Cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_1050768] dose of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab, or obinutuzumab, whichever is later, 
including doses that were administered as part of crossover treatment 
• All serious adverse events from the last dose of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, 
rituximab, or obinutuzumab, whichever is later, including doses that were 
administered as part of crossover treatment, and which are judged to be caused by [CONTACT_766191]2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab, or obinutuzumab, regardless of time of 
onset 
• Measurements of protocol-specified hem atology and clinical chemistry laboratory 
values 
• Measurements of protocol-specified vital signs 
• Assessment of ECGs • Assessment of physical findings on clinical physical examinations 
 
Patients who have an ongoing study drug −related adverse event will be followed until 
the event has resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_766227], new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, it is determined that the study treatment or participation is not the 
cause of the adverse event, or the study is terminated. 
See Section 5.2.3 for assessment of causality for adverse events. 
3.4.1 Safety Run-In Analysis  
As outlined in Figure 3b and Section [IP_ADDRESS], a safety run-in analysis (Cohort E) will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_514866] (IMC) to evaluate the combination of 
DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg with obinutuzumab.  This analysis will include data 
from the first [ADDRESS_1050769] cycle.  The decision to enroll an additional 3 patients will be made by [CONTACT_429]’s Medical Monitor in consultation with the safety science leader, biostatistician, and participating investigators.  At the IMC’s discretion, and at any 
point during enrollment of the safety run-in, a decision could be made that more than 
6 patients are needed to evaluate safety.  Additional patients may also be enrolled at dose 
levels below 1.8 mg/kg of DCDS4501A (i.e., 1.4 mg/kg) based upon review of all safety data.    
Safety summaries will be assessed at the safety run-in for SAEs; Grade 3-5 treatment-
related AEs; all AEs; all Grade 3-5 AEs; and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or dose modification/interruption. 
• During the 6-patient safety run-in, if any patient experiences a treatment-related 
death, then the obinutuzumab-containing portion of the study will be closed to 
further recruitment. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
76/P GO27834-A3 • During the 6-patient safety run-in: 
If [ADDRESS_1050770] 3 patients enrolled experience Grade 4 febrile neutropenia 
or serious (i.e., SAE) documented infection requiring IV antibiotics in the presence of Grade 3 −[ADDRESS_1050771] 3 patients enrolled experiences Grade 4 febrile neutropenia or 
serious (i.e., SAE) documented infection requiring IV antibiotics in the presence of Grade 3− [ADDRESS_1050772] 3 patients experience Grade 4 febrile neutropenia or serious (i.e., SAE) infection with Grade 3− [ADDRESS_1050773] 6 patients to be enrolled experiences Grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia or serious (i.e., SAE) documented infection requiring IV antibiotics in the presence of Grade 3 −4 neutropenia, then the obinutuzumab-containing 
portion of the study will be closed to further recruitment. 
Before the expansion portion of the study can begin (enrollment of 
Cohorts G and H), six patients must have completed the safety observation period 
(Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 2 Day 1 for a minimum of 21 days)  in the safety run-in 
(Cohort E). 
 
3.4.2 Internal Monitoring Committee  
This study will employ an Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC).  The purpose of the I MC 
will be to make recommendations regarding study conduct on the basis of trial safety data to ensure patient safety while receiving study treatment. 
The IMC will include the [COMPANY_002]/Genentech Medical Monitor, at least one other Clinical Science 
representative who is not directly involved in the study , a Drug Safety Scientist, a 
biostatistician, and a statistical programmer.  Representatives from other Sponsor 
functional areas may be included as additional ad hoc members. In addition to the ongoing assessment of the incidence and nature of adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities by [CONTACT_82171], the IMC will review the aforementioned data at least twice during the study.  
Throughout the course of the study, the IMC will meet at regular intervals during the 
study and  at the request of the Medical Monitor (e.g., on the basis of unexpected safety 
signals).  The IMC may make recommendations regarding study conduct, including, but not limited to, performing additional safety analyses, amending the study protocol, holding patient enrollment to one or both treatment arms pending further safety evaluations, holding/discontinuing study treatment, or terminating the study. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
77/P GO27834-A3 Specific operational details such as the committee’s composition, frequency and timing 
of meetings and members’ roles and responsibilities will be detailed  in the IMC 
charter. 
For Arms A and B:  The first planned review will occur after approximately [ADDRESS_1050774] 6 weeks follow-up.   
3.4.3 Risks Associated with  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  
The clinical safety profile of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A based on clinical data obtained in the ongoing Phase I studies are summarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Known and suspected risks, based on clinical data to date, are described below.  Guidelines regarding the management of these risks through dose and schedule modifications are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
Refer also to the Investigator’s Brochure for complete and updated details. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-Related Events 
Some MAbs may be associated with the development of allergic or anaphylactic reactions, to either the active protein or excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  True allergic or anaphylactic reactions are rare after the first dose of a product, as they require prior sensitization.  Patients with true allergic or anaphylactic reactions should not receive further doses of the product.  
MAbs may also be associated with reactions that are clinically indistinguishable from true allergic or anaphylactic reactions but are mediated through direct release of cytokines or other pro-inflammatory mediator s.  Such reactions are often termed IRRs.  
IRRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_570587] a MAb product and are generally less frequent and/or less severe with subsequent infusions.  They can often be managed by [CONTACT_570664]/or pre-treatment with various medications. 
Allergic or anaphylactic reactions and IRRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_766150].  The onset of symptoms may be rapid, and some reactions may be life threatening. 
Patients should be monitored for these types of reactions during and after receiving 
DCDT2908S and DCDS4501A.  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A should be administered in an environment under close supervision of a physician and where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available.  Specific guidelines for additional precautions to be taken during and following DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A administration are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
78/P GO27834-A3 [IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
There is a potential risk of TLS if treatment with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A results in 
the rapid destruction of a large number of tumor cells.  If any evidence of this occurs during the study, TLS prophylaxis measures will be instituted.  Patients who are considered to have a high tumor burden (e.g., lymphocyte count ≥
 25  × 109/L) or bulky 
lymphadenopathy and who are considered to be at risk for TLS by [CONTACT_766228] (e.g., allopurinol ≥ 300 mg/day orally or a suitable alternative 
treatment according to institutional practice starting 12 −24 hours prior to study 
treatment) and must be well hydrated prior to the initiation of study treatment at Cycle 1, Day 1.  These patients should continue to receive repeated prophylaxis with allopurinol and adequate hydration prior to each subsequent infusion as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bone Marrow Toxicity/Neutropenia 
Based on preclinical toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and clinical data from the ongoing Phase I Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, neutropenia has been identified as a known risk (adverse drug reaction) of both DCDT2908S and DCDS4501A.  Neutropenia and neutropenia-associated events were reversible but in some cases resulted in protocol-mandated dose reductions and/or delays.   
Adequate hematologic function should be confirmed before initiation of study treatment.  
Patients receiving study treatment will be r egularly monitored for evidence of marrow 
toxicity with complete blood counts.  Study  treatment may be delayed or modified due to 
hematologic toxicities, as described in Section 4.3.1.  
The use of G-CSF for neutropenia is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Transfusion support 
for anemia and thrombocytopenia is also permitted at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Febrile neutropenia is commonly associated with myelotoxicity, which is considered a 
class effect of MMAE because it is commonly reported with ADCETRIS
®, other similar 
ADCs, and vincristine sulfate. 
Clinical data show that among the most common SAEs reported in both DCS4968g and 
DCT4862g studies were febrile neutropenia and pyrexia. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity 
As expected with any recombinant antibody, DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, and 
obinutuzumab may elicit an immune response and patients may develop antibodies against DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, or obinutuzumab.  Patients will be closely monitored for any potential immune response to DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, and obinutuzumab.  Appropriate screening and confirmatory assays will be employed to detect ATAs at multiple timepoints before, during, and after treatment with DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
79/P GO27834-A3 and obinutuzumab.  Considering the historically low immunogenicity rate of rituximab in 
NHL patients, ATAs against rituximab will not be monitored in this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral  Neuropathy 
On the basis of clinical data from the ongoing Phase I Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g and data from brentuximab vedotin studies, an anti-CD30-vc-MMAE ADC (see Section 3.4.2), peripheral neuropathy (sensory and motor) has been identified as a known risk (adverse drug reaction) for both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A. 
Careful clinical evaluation of patients for neuropathy should be conducted prior to 
initiation of study drug.  Patients should be monitored for signs of peripheral neuropathy or worsening neuropathy and appropriate action taken per protocol guidelines.  Study treatment dose and schedule modifications for significant and prolonged neuropathic toxicity and dose-reduction are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reproductive Toxicity 
Adverse effects on human reproduction and fertility are anticipated with the administration of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, given the mechanism of action of MMAE.  Standard exclusion criteria will be used to ensure that patients of childbearing potential (male or female) are using adequate contraceptive methods.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A as well as with other ADCs using the same vc-MMAE platform.  Several patients given both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A had abnormal fasting blood sugar (FBS)  at screening with elevations of glucose following steroid administration prior to rituximab dose.  Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs and/or initiation or adjustment of anti-hyperglycemic medications.  Emerging data suggest that hyperglycemia may occur more commonly in individuals with abnormal FBS values or known diabetes.  This is also reported for ADCETRIS ® 
(2013 SmPC and 2013 USPI).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity 
Elevations in transaminase and/or bilirubin levels requiring dose modifications and treatment discontinuations have been reported in the ongoing clinical studies.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Commonly Repor ted Side Effects 
Other commonly reported side effects of both DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A in the Phase I clinical trials and within this study include fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, hair thinning or loss, joint pains, loss of appetite, diarrhea, muscle aches, constipation, increases in blood glucose, and headaches. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
80/P GO27834-A3 3.4.4 Risks Associated with ADCETRIS® (Brentuximab Vedotin)  
An ADC using the same MMAE drug and linker as that used in DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A, but coupled to an antibody ta rgeting the CD30 antigen (brentuximab 
vedotin, ADCETRIS®, Seattle Genetics), was recently approved by [CONTACT_766288]-cell lymphoma.   
The most common adverse reactions observed in studies with brentuximab vedotin 
(occurring in at least 20% of patients) were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, anemia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], diarrhea, pyrexia, rash, thrombocytopenia, cough, and vomiting.   
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 31% of patients receiving ADCETRIS
®.  The 
most common occurring in > 2% of patients included peripheral motor neuropathy, 
abdominal pain, septic shock, supraventricular arrhythmia, pain in extremity, and urinary 
tract infection.  In addition, John Cunningham (JC) virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death has been reported.   
Because of the use of the same MMAE drug, it is possible that the adverse events 
observed with the use of brentuximab vedotin can also be observed with the use of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.   
Refer to the current version of the ADCETRIS
® Prescribing Information for full and 
updated details. 
3.4.5 Risks Associated with Rituximab Therapy and Their 
Management  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reactions 
In single-agent clinical trials of rituximab and in post-marketing surveillance studies, mild 
to moderate infusion reactions consisting of fever and chills/rigors occurred in the majority of patients during the first rituximab infusion.  Other frequent infusion reaction signs and symptoms included nausea, pruritus, angioedema, asthenia, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, throat irritation, rhinitis, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, and hypertension.  These reactions generally occurred within 30− [ADDRESS_1050775] infusion, and they resolved with slowing or interruption of the rituximab infusion and with supportive care (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen/paracetamol, IV saline, meperidine, and vasopressors).  The incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion and decreased with each subsequent infusion. 
Rituximab has caused severe infusion reactions.  In some cases, these reactions were 
fatal.  These severe reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_766125] a time to onset of 30 −120 minutes.  Signs and symptoms of severe infusion reactions may include 
urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, or bronchospasm and may require 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
81/P GO27834-A3 interruption of rituximab administration.  The most severe manifestations and sequelae 
include pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, 
ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events (see Appendix D).  Approximately 80% of fatal infusion reactions occurred in association 
with the first infusion of rituximab.  Because of this, patients should receive premedication with acetaminophen/paracetamol, antihistamines, or corticosteroids, in accordance with standard clinical practice, prior to rituximab infusions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Severe Infusion Reactions 
Administration of rituximab will occur in a setting with emergency equipment and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  The rituximab infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions on the basis of clinical judgment.   
Medications and supportive care measures ⎯including, but not limited to, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
antihistamines, glucocorticoids, IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators and 
acetaminophen/paracetamol⎯should be available for immediate use and instituted as medically indicated for use in the event of a reaction during administration.   
In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 
100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved.  Patients requiring close monitoring during all rituximab infusions include those with preexisting cardiac and pulmonary conditions, those with prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary adverse events, and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥
 25,000/μ L) with or 
without evidence of high tumor burden. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Rapid reductions in tumor volume followed by [CONTACT_22702], hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hype rphosphatemia have been reported within 
12−[ADDRESS_1050776] 
been reported in the setting of TLS following treatment with rituximab.  The risks of TLS appear to be greater in patients with high tumor burden.  Patients deemed to be at high risk for TLS complications may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive their initial dose of rituximab over 2 consecutive days (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Correction of electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function and fluid balance, and administration of supportive care, including dialysis, should be initiated as indicated.  Following complete resolution of TLS complications, rituximab has been tolerated when re-administered in conjunction with prophylactic therapy for TLS in a limited number of cases. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatitis B Reactivation with  Related Fulminant Hepatitis and 
Other Viral Infections 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported for some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of these patients received rituximab in combination with 
chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
82/P GO27834-A3 [ADDRESS_1050777] dose of 
rituximab.  Patients with serologic findings consistent with chronic HBV (hepatitis B 
surface antigen [HBsAg] positivity) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (HCV RNA or antibody positivity) are ineligible for this study.  Patients who are not chronically infected with HBV but have serologic evidence of prior infection at baseline (IgG hepatitis B core antibody[anti-HBc] positive but HBV DNA negative) may be eligible (if believed to be in the patient’s best interest by [CONTACT_26791]) and would be monitored closely for perturbations in liver function during the period of rituximab treatment and every 2 −[ADDRESS_1050778] 6 months after completion of rituximab therapy (Yeo et al. 2009 ). 
Additional serious viral infections, new, reactivated, or exacerbated (e.g., infections caused by [CONTACT_27912], varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, parvovirus B19, JC virus, and HCV) have been reported with rituximab, mainly in patients who had received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Particular attention should be given to patients who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment such as high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.  JC virus infection resulting in PML and death 
has been observed in rituximab-treated patients with hematologic malignancies or with autoimmune diseases.  Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of the patient’s last infusion of rituximab.  Physicians should consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations.  Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture.  Physicians should discontinue rituximab (and DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A) and consider discontinuation or reduction of any immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiovascular Events 
Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of rituximab.  Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including arrhythmias and angina, who have had recurrences of these events during rituximab therapy should be monitored throughout the infusion and the immediate post-infusion period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bowel Obstruction and Perforation 
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation, in some cases leading to death, were observed in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL.  In post-marketing reports, which include patients with low-grade or follicular NHL and patients with DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days (range, 1−77 days) in patients with documented gastrointestinal perforation.  Complaints 
of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
83/P GO27834-A3 [IP_ADDRESS] Immunization 
The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not 
been studied.  Patients who participate in this study may not receive either primary or 
booster with live virus vaccines for at least 28 days  prior to initiation of rituximab or at any 
time during study treatment.  Investigators should review the status of potential study 
patients being considered for this study and follow the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for adult with non-live vaccines intended to prevent infectious diseases prior to study therapy.

3.4.6 Risks Associated wi th Obinutuzumab Therapy  
No evidence available at the time of the approval of this protocol indicates that special 
warnings or precautions are appropriate other than those noted in the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure and as described in the following sections. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions 
(including Anaphylaxis) 
The commonly experienced IRRs have been characterized by [CONTACT_411], chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, fatigue, and other symptoms. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_570590]-related symptoms, such as hypoxia, dyspnea, bronchospasm, 
larynx and throat irritation, and laryngeal edema, have also been reported.  These IRRs were mostly mild or moderate (NCI CTCAE v4.0, Grade 1 and 2 events), and
 < 10% of 
the events were severe (Grade 3 events), occurring predominantly during the first hour of the infusion or shortly after the first infusion had finished.  The events resolved with the slowing or interruption of the infusion and supportive care.  The incidence and severity of IRRs decreased with subsequent infusions.  Extensive tumor burden predominantly localized in the blood circulation (e.g., high peripheral lymphocyte count in patients with CLL) may be a predisposing factor for the development of IRRs. 
IRRs may be clinically indistinguishable fr om IgE-mediated allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
TLS has been reported with obinutuzumab administration.  Patients with a high tumor 
burden, including patients with a lymphocyte count ≥ 25  × 109/L, particularly patients with 
B-cell CLL and MCL, are at increased risk for TLS and severe IRRs.  All patients with peripheral blood lymphocyte counts of ≥
 25  × 109/L or bulky adenopathy must receive 
prophylaxis for TLS prior to the initiation of study treatment.  This includes appropriate hydration, consisting of fluid intake of approximately 3 L/day, starting 1
−[ADDRESS_1050779] dose of obinutuzumab, and administration of allopurinol (300 mg/day orally) or a 
suitable alternative (i.e., rasburicase) treatment, starting at least 12  − 24 hours prior to the 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
84/P GO27834-A3 first infusion of obinutuzumab (Cycle 1, Day 1).  All patients should then be carefully 
monitored during the initial weeks of treatment.  Patients still considered at risk for TLS because of persistently high tumor burden (i .e., peripheral blood lymphocyte counts 
≥
 25  × 109/L) before the second and subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab should 
receive continuous TLS prophylaxis with allopurinol or a suitable alternative (i.e., rasburicase) and adequate hydration until the risk is abated, as determi ned by [CONTACT_1275].  For treatment of TLS, correct electrolyte ab normalities, monitor renal function and 
fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
Cases of Grade [ADDRESS_1050780] Grade 2.  Use of G-CSF has been found to result in a rapid normalization of neutrophils, similar to what has been observed in patients treated with rituximab.  The use of G-CSF is allowed for treatment of neutropenia in this study.  Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is recommended according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, namely for patients who are ≥
 60 years old and/or with co-
morbidities ( Lyman et al. 2004).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia 
Severe and life-threatening thrombocytopenia, including acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within 24 hours after the infusion), has been observed during treatment with obinutuzumab.  Fatal hemorrhagic events have also been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab.  It seems that the first cycle is the greatest risk of hemorrhage in patients treated with obinutuzumab.  A clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events has not been established.  Patients treated with concomitant medication, which could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia-related events (e.g., platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants), may be at greater risk of bleeding.  Patients should be closely monitored for thrombocytopenia, especially during the first cycle; regular laboratory tests should be performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be considered in case of severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia.  Transfusion of blood products (i.e., platelet transfusion) according to institutional practice is at the discretion of the treating physician.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infection 
On the basis of its anticipated mode of action, resulting in profound B-cell depletion, obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections.  Infections have been reported in patients receiving obinutuzumab.  Therefore, obinutuzumab should not be administered to patients with active severe infections. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
85/P GO27834-A3 A “black-box” warning for obinutuzumab states that reactivation of hepatitis B as well as 
other serious viral infections (e.g., infections caused by [CONTACT_27912], Varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, JC virus, and HCV) that were new, reactivated, or exacerbated have been reported with the B cell
−depleting antibody rituximab mainly in 
patients who had received the drug in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic SCT.  The risk of such infections with obinutuzumab is unknown.  Particular attention should be given to patients who have previously received significant immunosuppressive treatment, such as high-dose chemotherapy and SCT. 
A “black-box” warning for obinutuzumab states that JC viral infection (including fatal) that 
resulted in PML with destructive infection of oligodendrocytes of the CNS white matte have been reported in patients treated with anti-CD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including rituximab and obinutuzumab. 
The diagnosis of PML should be considered in any patient presenting with new-onset 
neurologic manifestations.  The symptoms of PML are unspecific and can vary depending on the affected region of the brain.  Motor involvement with corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_380619], sensory involvement, cerebellar deficits, and visual field defects are common.  Some syndromes regarded as cortical (e.g., aphasia or visual-spatial disorientation) can occur. 
Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain 
MRI, and lumbar puncture (cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_570591]).  
Therapy with obinutuzumab should be withheld during the investigation of potential PML 
and permanently discontinued in case of confirmed PML.  Discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should also be considered.  The patient should be referred to a neurologist for the diagnosis and management of PML. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunization 
The safety of immunization with live virus vaccines following obinutuzumab therapy has not been studied.  Thus, vaccination with live viru s vaccines is not recommended during treatment 
and until B-cell recovery. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Worsening of Preexisting Cardiac Condition 
In patients with underlying cardiac disease and tr eated with obinutuzumab, adverse events such 
as angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and tac hyarrhythmia, have been observed.  These events 
may occur as part of an IRR and can be fatal.  Therefore, patients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely.  In addition, these patients should be hydrated with caution to 
prevent a potential fluid overload.

86/P GO27834-A3 3.5 MINIMIZATION OF BIAS  
For the randomized, non-comparative, open-label portion of the study, patients were 
randomly allocated to two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio through use of an Interactive Voice and Web Response System (IXRS).  A dynamic stratified randomization scheme was employed to ensure balance in the stratification factors as specified in Section 3.1.  This portion of the study (Arms A and B) is now closed to enrollment. 
3.[ADDRESS_1050781] Research Organization (CRO) will be utilized  to perform project management, study 
management, and clinical monitoring.  G enentech will conduct CRO oversight, approve 
patient eligibility, and perform dose escalation decision-making, medical monitoring, and statistical programming and analysis.  An IMC (see Section 3.4) will provide an additional level of safety monitoring for the study.  
Approximately 40 study centers in the [LOCATION_002], Canada, and Europe will 
participate in the study to enroll approximately 252 patients.  Additional patients may be enrolled in order to obtain additional safety and/or efficacy data. 
Electronic data capture (EDC) will be utilized for this study.  An IXRS will be used to 
assign patient numbers.  A central laboratory will be used for sample management and storage until shipment to one of several specialty laboratories or Genentech for analysis.  An IRF will be used for the collection and possible assessment of radiographic images from tumor assessments.  Additional vendors for ECG collection and possible analysis and for PRO collection and data entry will be used. 
3.7 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the FDA regulations, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable local, state, and federal laws, as well as other applicable country laws.

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
This is an open-label study.  After written informed consent has been obtained and 
preliminary eligibility has been established, the study site will submit documentation 
supporting eligibility to the Sponsor via facsimile and obtain the Sponsor’s approval to enroll the patient.  Once the Sponsor reviews and approves the patient for enrollment, the patient number will be assigned via IXRS.  
As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], only select investigator sites that have agreed to 
participate in the non-randomized (Cohorts C and D) portion of the study w ill enroll 
patients into these cohorts.  Cohorts C and D will be opened sequentially following 
completion of the randomized portion of the study for patients with FL. 
For obinutuzumab-containing cohorts (Cohorts E, G, and H), patients with either 
relapsed or refractory follicular NHL or relapsed or refractory DLBCL will be enrolled.  After the safety run-in stage for DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with 
obinutuzumab, the  non-randomized dose-expansion portion of the study will enroll 
40 relapsed or refractory FL  patients  into Cohort G and 40 relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL patients into Cohort H.   
Personnel responsible for performing PK and ATA assays will receive participants’ 
treatment assignments to identify appropriate PK and ATA samples to be analyzed in the appropriate corresponding assays.  
4.3 STUDY TREATMENT  
4.3.1 DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation and Storage 
a. DCDT2980S 
DCDT2980S will be provided as a lyophilized powder in a single-use 20-cc vial.  
The solution for reconstitution is Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI), and the reconstitution 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
90/P GO27834-A3 volume is 2.6 mL to yield a final concentration of 20 mg/mL DCDT2980S in 40 mM 
L-histidine hydrochloride, 240 mM sucrose, and 0.02% polysorbate 20, pH 6.0. 
Reconstituted DCDT2980S should be further diluted with sterile 0.9% NaCl to a total 
volume of [ADDRESS_1050788] be refrigerated at 2 °C−8°C (36°F−46°F) upon receipt until use.  
DCDT2980S should not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_242652].  Vial contents should not be frozen or shaken and should be protected from direct sunlight.  After reconstitution, DCDT2980S vials may be stored at room temperatures (>
 8°C−25°C [> 46°F−77°F]) for up to 4 hours or at refrigerated 
temperatures (2 °C−8°C [36°F−46°F]) for up to 8 hours prior to use.  Once DCDT2980S 
has been diluted with sterile 0.9% NaCl, the solution should be used within 4 hours at room temperature or within 8 hours at refrigerated temperature.  Vials are intended for single use only; therefore, any remaining solution should be discarded. 
For further details, refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator’s  Brochure. 
b. DCDS4501A 
DCDS4501A is provided as a liquid formulati on and contains no preservatives.  Each 
single-use 20-cc vial is filled to deliver [ADDRESS_1050789] is 
formulated as 10 mg/mL DCDS4501A in 20 mM L-histidine acetate, 240 mM sucrose, 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20, pH 5.5.  
DCDS4501A will be administered to patients intravenously via syringe pump with an 
IV infusion set containing a 0.22 −µm in-line filter with a final volume of DCDS4501A 
determined by [CONTACT_570641].  DCDS4501A vials must be refrigerated at 2 °C−8°C (36°F−46°F) upon receipt until use.  
DCDS4501A vials may be stored at room temperature ( > 8°C−25°C [46°F −77°F]) for up 
to [ADDRESS_1050790] sunlight.  Vials are intended for single use only; therefore, any remaining solution should be discarded. 
Once the DCDS4501A dose solution has been prepared, the solution should be used 
within 4 hours at room temperature ( > 8 °C−25°C [46°F−77°F]) or within 8 hours 
refrigerated at 2°C −8°C (36°F −46°F).  Because the drug product contains no 
preservatives, the Sponsor recommends using DCDS4501A in a syringe and extension set as soon as possible to reduce the risk of microbial contamination.   
For further details, refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
91/P GO27834-A3 [IP_ADDRESS] Dosage and Administration 
a. DCDT2980S-Specific Information 
DCDT2980S will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_16228].  Compatibility testing has 
shown that DCDT2980S is stable when diluted in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags to a concentration at or above 0.04 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl diluent.  The drug product will be delivered following dilution in 0.9% NaCl with a final DCDT2980S concentration determined based on dose and patient weight.  The study drug will be diluted in a PVC bag and delivered using a 0.22 µm in-line filter on the IV infusion set. 
Additional information/instructions regarding study drug administration will be provided in 
the Pharmacy Binder. 
b. DCDS4501A-Specific Information 
DCDS4501A will be administered to patients intravenously via syringe pump with an 
IV infusion set containing a 0.22 µm in-line filter with a final volume of DCDS4501A determined by [CONTACT_570641].  Compatibility testing has shown that DCDS4501A is stable both in syringes made of polypropylene (PP) and in standard extension sets with 0.22 µm in-line filter, when stored neat or diluted with 0.9% NaCl saline.   
Additional information/instructions regarding study drug administration will be provided in 
the Pharmacy Binder. 
c. General Information 
The total dose of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A for each patient will depend on the patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of each cycle.  The patient weight obtained during screening may be used for dose determination at all treatment cycles; if the patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of a given treatment cycle differs by >10% from the weight obtained during screening, the new weight should be used to calculate the dose.   
For both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, the initial dose will be administered to 
well-hydrated (based on clinical judgment) patients over 90 (±
 10) minutes.  
Premedication with acetaminophen or paracetamol (e.g., 500 −1000 mg) and 
diphenhydramine (e.g., 50 °C−100 mg) per institutional standard practice may be 
administered prior to each infusion.  Administration of corticosteroids is permitted at the discretion of the treating physician.  Patients who do not receive premedications prior to the first dose of DCDT2980S and who develop an IRR during the first dose should receive premedications prior to  subsequent doses (see Table 1). 
The DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A infusion may be slowed or interrupted for patients experiencing infusion-associated symptoms.  Following the initial dose, patients will be observed for 90 minutes for fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, nausea, or other infusion-associated symptoms.  If the infusion is well-tolerated, subsequent doses of 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
92/P GO27834-A3 DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A may be administered over 30 ( ± 10) minutes, followed by a 
30-minute observation period post-infusion.   
For instructions on study drug preparation and administration, refer to the DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification 
Patients should be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to each dose using the 
NCI CTCAE v4.0 grading scale.  Dosing will occur only if a patient’s clinical assessment and laboratory test values are acceptable.  If scheduled dosing coincides with a holiday that precludes dosing, dosing should commence on the nearest following date, with subsequent dosing continuing on a 21-day schedule as applicable. 
Specific guidelines around dosage modifications for neutropenia and peripheral 
neuropathy are detailed below in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Patients who 
experience other treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity
 or laboratory abnormalities  will 
be allowed to delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab or obinutuzumab) for up to 2 weeks to allow for recovery.  Patients may continue to receive additional infusions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A per their treatment assignment provided that the toxicity has resolved to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of the baseline value, 
whichever is lower, within the 2− week delay period.  The decision for dose modification 
will be made on the basis of the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continued study treatment and in consultation with the Medical Monitor.   
Once dose reductions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A are made for toxicity, dose 
re-escalation will not be allowed.   
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to DCDT2980S or DCDS4501 A, requiring its 
discontinuation, single-agent rituximab may be continued on the basis of the 
investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit and with the approval of the Medical Monitor.  Patients enrolled in obinutuzumab-containing cohorts will not continue on single-agent obinutuzumab unless approved by [CONTACT_1689]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved to Grade ≤ 2 or ≥ 80% of baseline value, 
whichever is lower, may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  Dosing of both DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab should be held during this period.  If all study drug −related toxicities have resolved sufficiently, the 
patient may resume DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab dosing on the regular every-21-day schedule.   
A patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_570667] a patient’s dosing regimen from 21-day to 28-day cycles would provide 
sufficient time for recovery from a transient and reversible toxicity ⎯for example, 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
93/P GO27834-A3 cytopenia without requiring repeated treatment delays.  Modifications to the dosing 
schedule in this fashion must be made in consultation with and with the approval of the 
Medical Monitor. 
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for continuation of dosing after the 2-week delay 
may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes (see Section 4.5.6).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].  
Specific guidelines around schedule modifications for neutropenia and peripheral 
neuropathy are detailed below in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reaction 
Patients will be monitored during and after each DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A infusion for [ADDRESS_1050791] infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions in the absence of infusion-related adverse events.  Patients who experience infusion-related symptoms should be managed as described in Table 1.  Precautions for suspected anaphylactic reaction during study drug infusions are provided in Appendix D. 
In the event of a life-threatening IRR, which may include pulmonary or cardiac events, or 
an IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction, administration of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be immediately discontinued.  Patients who experience these reactions should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment and are not eligible to receive any additional study treatment. 
Premedication prior to DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A with acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
antihistamines, or corticosteroids per standard clinical practice is permitted⎯for example, in patients with substantial tumor burden and where the risk of cytokine release syndrome is high.  In patients who do not receive premedication prior to any given dose of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A and who develop any Grade ≥
 2 
infusion-related toxicity, premedication should be administered prior to subsequent doses.

Adverse Events. 
a Refer to the NCI CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_1050795] ed in the text preceding this table. 
b Supportive treatment:  Patients should be treated with acetaminophen/paracetamol and an 
antihistamine such as diphenhydramine if they  have not been received in the last 4 hours.  
IV saline may be indicated.  For bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, patients may require 
antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids (e .g., 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent), 
and/or bronchodilators.  Patients with hypotens ion requiring vasopressor support must be 
permanently discontinued from study drug. 
c Infusion rate escalation after re-initiation:  Upon complete resolution of symptoms, the infusion 
may be resumed at 50% of the rate achieved prior to interruption.  In the absence of 
infusion-related symptoms, the rate of infusion ma y be escalated in increments of 50 mg/hr every 
30 minutes.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
Because neutropenia is a known risk of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the use of growth factor support (G-CSF) as prophylactic and therapeutic indications is permitted (see Appendi x F) in order to allow continued dosing 
of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A.  Dose modifications for patients who experience treatment-related Grade 3− 4 neutropenia in the context of G-CSF usage are as follows: 
• Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF (i.e., prior to the first dose of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A) is permitted for patients with clinical factors listed in 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
95/P GO27834-A3 Appendix F or who otherwise are considered at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_766128]. 
• Patients who experience treatment-related Grade 3− 4 neutropenia will be allowed to 
delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab or obinutuzumab) for up 
to two weeks to allow for recovery.  Therapeutic G-CSF is permitted as clinically 
indicated (see Appendix F) and to facilitate neutrophil recovery to allow subsequent DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dosing. 
• Subsequent dosing of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A and rituximab/obinutuzumab is 
permitted provided that the neutropenia has resolved to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of the 
baseline value, whichever is lower, within the 2-week period.   
• If prophylactic G-CSF was not administered prior to the cycle in which the 
Grade 3− 4 neutropenia developed, then prophylactic G-CSF may be administered 
prior to subsequent cycles without DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose reduction.  The dose schedule may be changed from 21-day to 28-day cycles to provide sufficient 
time for neutrophil recovery in subsequent cycles.  In the absence of prophylactic 
G-CSF or dose schedule modification, the dose of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A in 
subsequent cycles should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg  for Arms A and B .  For 
Cohorts E, G, and H, patients will be given DCDS4501A at a dose of 
1.8 mg/kg, and further dose reductions cannot be made.   
• If Grade 3− 4 neutropenia recurs with prophylactic G-CSF, the dose for subsequent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg  for Arms A and B.  
Prophylactic G-CSF and dose schedule modifications as described above are 
permitted in order to maintain the reduced DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose level and 
schedule. 
• If Grade 3− 4 neutropenia recurs at the reduced dose despi[INVESTIGATOR_766151] G-CSF, then the patient should be discontinued from study treatment.   
• For patients enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C 
and D, as well as Cohorts E, G, and H), dose reductions  will not be allowed for 
neutropenia .  Administration of therapeutic/prophylactic G-CSF and dose-schedule 
modifications as described above are allo wed.  Patients who have persistent or 
recurrent Grade 3 −4 neutropenia as defined above should be discontinued from 
study treatment. 
 
The determination of the dose and schedule modifications will be made on the basis of 
the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continuing study treatment and with the approval of the Medical Monitor.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) is a known risk of DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  For new or worsening drug-related Grade 2 or 3 peripheral sensory and/or motor neuropathy, dosing should be held for up to 2 weeks until peripheral neuropathy improves to Grade 1 or baseline grade.  Continuation of study treatment following dose delays beyond 2 weeks will require consultation with and 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
96/P GO27834-A3 approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment of the benefit-risk analysis of 
continuing to delay study treatment. 
For patients enrolled on arms A or B f ollowing resolution of peripheral neuropathy 
(sensory and/or motor), subsequent doses of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be 
reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.  If worsening Grade 2 or 3 peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) recurs following dose reduction, study treatment should be discontinued.  For 
Grade 4  peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), study treatment should be 
discontinued.  
For patients enrolled into  Cohorts C and D,  dose modifications will not be allowed.  
Patients who have Grade 2 or 3 peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), as 
defined above, should be discontinued from study treatment.    
For patients enrolled on Cohorts E, G, or H, following resolution of Grade 2 or Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy (sensory  and/or motor), subsequent  doses of DCDS4501A should 
be permanently reduced from 1.8 mg/kg to 1. 4 mg/kg.  If worsening Grade 2 or Grade 3 
peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) recurs following dose reduction, study treatment should be discontinued.  For Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), study treatment should be discontinued.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A as well as with other ADCs using the same vc-MMAE platform.  Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs and/or initiation of improved anti-hyperglyce mic medications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
For symptomatic fasting Grade 3 ( >
 250− 500 mg/dL) or asymptomatic Grade 4 
(> 500 mg/dL) hyperglycemia, medical management  should be initiated immediately and 
consultation with a specialist should be considered.  If the hyperglycemia persists for >
 1 week after initiation of management, dose modification, schedule modification, or 
discontinuation of study treatment should be considered.  In these cases, the study 
Medical Monitor should be consulted to assess the benefit-risk balance of continued study treatment. 
4.3.2 Rituximab  
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation 
Rituximab (Rituxan®/MabThera®) is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid 
concentrate for IV administration.  Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in 500-mg (50-mL) single-use vials.  A single-unit, 500-mg carton contains one 50-mL vial of rituximab (10 mg/mL).  The product is formulated for IV administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL s odium citrate dihydrate, and 0.7 mg/mL 
polysorbate 80, after reconstitution with SWFI.  The pH is adjusted to 6.5.  Vials are for 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
97/P GO27834-A3 single use.  Each vial and carton will contain a label (either single-panel or booklet) 
affixed to the vial or carton.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, Admini stration, and Storage 
Rituximab (Rituxan®, MabThera®) will be administered intravenously once per 3-week 
(or 4-week) cycle.  The infusion at 375 mg/m2 for each dose will be based on the 
patient’s body surface area at screening and will remain the same throughout the study.   
If a scheduled dose of rituximab falls outside of the ±  2-day window for reasons other 
than an adverse event, the site must notify and have a discussion with the Genentech 
Medical Monitor prior to rituximab administ ration.  Such dosing may not necessarily 
qualify as a protocol deviation, if deemed to be in the best interests of the patient, after consultation with the Medical Monitor and agreed to in advance by [CONTACT_1689].  
Rituximab should not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  Infusion reactions may 
occur.  Premedication consisting of acetaminophen (or paracetamol), diphenhydramine (or other suitable antihistamine), and a single dose of hydrocortisone (e.g., up to 100 mg or an equivalent dose of methylprednisolone) may also be administered beginning with the first infusion, per standard clinical practice.  Premedication may attenuate infusion reactions.  Because transient hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding antihypertensive medications for [ADDRESS_1050796] Infusion 
The rituximab solution for infusion should be administered intravenously at an initial rate of 50 mg/hr.  Rituximab should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs.  If infusion reactions do not occur, the infusion rate should be escalated in 50 −mg/hr increments 
every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted.  The infusion can continue at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of patient symptoms.   
b. Subsequent Infusions 
If the patient tolerates the first infusion well, subsequent rituximab infusions may be administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr and increased in 100 −mg/hr increments at 
30-minute intervals to a maximum of 400 mg/hr, as tolerated.  If the patient does not tolerate the first infusion well, the guidelines for the first infusion should be followed. 
If a patient tolerates the first three cycles of study treatment without significant infusion 
reactions, rituximab may be administered as “rapid infusion” in accordance with local institutional guidelines. 
c. Storage 
Rituximab vials must be stored at 2 °C−8°C (36°C−46°F).  Rituximab vials should be 
stored in the outer carton in order to protect them from light.  Rituximab solution for 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
98/P GO27834-A3 infusion may be stored at 2 °C−8°C (36°C−46°F) for 24 hours and has been shown to be 
stable for an additional 12 hours at room temperature.  However, because rituximab 
does not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be stored refrigerated (2°C−8°C).  No incompatibilities between rituximab and PVC or polyethylene (PE) bags 
have been observed. 
See the Rituxan
® (Rituximab) Package Insert or SmPC (in the European Union) for 
additional information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification 
There will be no rituximab dose modification in this study.  Patients at high risk for 
TLS complications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive their initial dose of rituximab over 2 consecutive days (e.g., 125 mg/m
2 on Day 1, 
250 mg/m2 on Day 2; with DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose potentially delayed to Day 3). 
Any NCI CTCAE (v4.0) toxicity Grade ≥ 3 in severity that is deemed related to rituximab 
treatment will require interruption of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab) until resolution to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of baseline, whichever is lower.  Resumption of 
rituximab treatment may be considered in patients with resolution of toxicities to Grade ≤
 1 within 2 weeks at the discretion of the investigator, after consultation with the 
Medical Monitor.  Failure of such toxiciti es to resolve after 2-week delay in study 
treatment will require permanent discontinuation of rituximab.  Continuation of rituximab 
treatment may be permitted on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].   
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to rituximab requiring its discontinuation, 
single-agent DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be continued on the basis of the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit and with the approval of the Medical Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved (i.e., to Grade ≤  1 or ≥  80% of baseline) 
may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  If after the up to −2-week 
delay, all study drug −related toxicities have resolved sufficiently, the patient may receive 
the scheduled doses of rituximab.  In addition, a patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_766233] a patient’s dosing regimen from 21-day to  28-day cycles would provide sufficient time for recovery 
from transient cytopenias without requiring repeated treatment delays. 
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for dosing after the additional [ADDRESS_1050797] 
elapsed may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes (see Section 4.5.1).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by 
 
[CONTACT_1738]:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
99/P GO27834-A3 the investigator and approval from the Medical Monitor.  In addition, delay of therapy 
because of toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation and will be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reaction 
Patients will be monitored during and after each rituximab infusion for [ADDRESS_1050798] infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions in the absence of infusion-related adverse events.  Patients who experience infusion-related symptoms should be managed as directed in Table 1 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
In the event of a life-threatening IRR (which may include pulmonary or cardiac events) or 
IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction to rituximab, rituximab should be discontinued and no additional rituximab should be administered.  Patients who experience these reactions should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment and should be discontinued from study treatment. 
4.3.3 Obinutuzumab  
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation 
Obinutuzumab (GA101/Gazyva ™/Gazyvaro) is a clear, colorless to slightly brownish 
liquid, provided as a single 1000-mg dose liquid concentrate with a strength of 25 mg/mL.  It is supplied in 50 −mL glass vials containing 40 mL of the 25 mg/mL liquid 
concentrate.  In addition to the antibody, the liquid also contains histidine/histidine-HCl, trehalose, poloxamer 188, and highly purified water (HPW). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, Admini stration, and Storage 
Obinutuzumab will be administered by [CONTACT_27920] (flat) dose of 1000 mg in combination with DCDS4501A, as outlined in Section 3.1.3.  Obinutuzumab will be administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 −8 (see Table 2).  
No dose modifications of obinutuzumab are allowed. 
All obinutuzumab infusions should be administered after premedication with oral 
acetaminophen and an antihistamine (see Section 4.4.1).  The prophylactic use of corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent) may also be considered for patients thought to be at high risk for IRRs, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093], and should be administered prior to the obinutuzumab infusion.  On Cycle [ADDRESS_1050799] 60 minutes prior to the obinutuzumab infusion.  Premedication with prednisone or prednisolone is mandatory in patients who had an IRR and should continue until IRRs no longer occur during antibody infusion.  For the management of IRRs and anaphylaxis, see Table 1 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
If it is the strong preference of the investigator or of the site (e.g., for logistical reasons) 
or if the patient is at increased risk for an IRR (high tumor burden, high peripheral lymphocyte count), the administration of obinutuzumab infusion can be split over 2 days.

100/P GO27834-A3 Table [ADDRESS_1050800] Infusion (Cycle 1 Day 1)  Subsequent Infusions  
• Begin infusion at an initial rate of 50 mg/hr. 
• If no infusion-related or hypersensitivity 
reaction occurs, increase the infusion rate in 
50-mg/hour increments every 30 minutes to a 
maximum of 400 mg/hr. 
• If a reaction develops, stop or slow the 
infusion.  Administer medications and supportive care in accordance with institutional guidelines.  If reaction has resolved, resume the infusion at a 50% reduction in rate (i.e., 50% of rate used 
at the time the reaction occurred).
 • If the patient experienced an infusion-related 
or hypersensitivity reaction during the prior 
infusion, use full premedication including 100 mg prednisone/prednisolone (until no further IRR occurs), begin infusion at an initial rate of 50 mg/hr,  and follow instructions 
for first infusion. 
• If the patient tolerated the prior infusion well 
(defined by [CONTACT_570644] 2 reactions during a final infusion rate of 
≥ 100 mg/hr), 
begin infusion at a rate of 100 mg/hr. 
• If no reaction occurs, increase the infusion 
rate in 100-mg/hour increments every 
30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. 
• If a reaction develops, stop or slow the 
infusion.  Administer medications and supportive care in accordance with institutional guidelines.  If reaction has resolved, resume the infusion at a 50% reduction in rate (i.e., 50% of rate used 
at the time the reaction occurred).
 
IRR  = infusion-related reaction.  
In all parts of the study, obinutuzumab must be administered in a clinical (inpatient or 
outpatient) setting.  Full emergency resuscitation facilities should be immediately available, and patients should be under the close supervision of the investigator at all times.  For the management of IRRs and anaphylaxis, see Table 1 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Obinutuzumab should be administered as a slow IV infusion through a dedicated line.  
IV infusion pumps should be used to control the infusion rate of obinutuzumab.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus.  Administration sets with PVC, polyurethane (PUR), or PE as a product contact [CONTACT_26778] (PO), polypropylene (PP), PVC, or PE as a product contact [CONTACT_570642].  Do not use an additional in-line filter because of potential adsorption. 
The recommended storage conditions for obinutuzumab drug product are between 2°C 
and 8°C, protected from light.  For clinical formulation-specific and batch-specific instructions and information on in-use stability, see the packaging label.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification 
There will be no obinutuzumab dose modification in this study.  Patients at high risk for TLS complications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive obinutuzumab over 2 consecutive days (with DCDS4501A dose potentially delayed to Day 2 or Day 3). 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
101/P GO27834-A3 Any NCI CTCAE (v4.0) toxicity Grade ≥ 3 in severity that is deemed related to 
obinutuzumab treatment will require interr uption of study treatment (both DCDS4501A 
and obinutuzumab) until resolution to Grade ≤ 2 or ≥ 80% of baseline, whichever is lower.  
Resumption of obinutuzumab treatment may be considered in patients with resolution of 
toxicities to Grade ≤ 1 within 2 weeks at the discretion of the investigator, 
after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  Failure of such toxicities to resolve after 2-week delay in study treatment will require permanent discontinuation of obinutuzumab.  Continuation of study treatment followi ng dose delays beyond 2 weeks will require 
consultation with and approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment of the benefit-risk analysis of continuing to delay study treatment.  
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to obinutuzumab requiring its discontinuation, 
single-agent DCDS4501A will not be permitted.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved (i.e., to Grade ≤ 1 or ≥ 80% of baseline) 
may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  Dosing of both DCDS4501A 
and obinutuzumab should be held during this period.  If all study drug −related toxicities 
have resolved to Grade  ≤ 1 or ≥ 80% of baseline, the patient may resume DCDS4501A 
and obinutuzumab dosing on the regular every −21−day schedule.  In addition, a 
patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_766233] a patient’s dosi ng regimen from 21-day to 28-day cycles 
would provide sufficient time for recovery from transient cytopenias without requiring repeated treatment delays. 
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for dosing after the additional [ADDRESS_1050801] 
elapsed may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes (see Section 4.5.6).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].  In addition, delay of therapy because of toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation and will be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
Specific guidelines around schedule modifications for thrombocytopenia and febrile 
neutropenia are detailed below in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia is a known risk of obinutuzumab (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  If the clinical 
condition of a patient requires the use of concomitant anticoagulants, the patient is at increased risk of bleeding when the platelet count is 
< 20,000/μL.  When possible, 
replace prior therapy with Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) before Cycle 1 Day 1.  Clinical decision making may be adjusted depending on the patient-specific assessment of benefit and risk. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
102/P GO27834-A3 In the event of severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 10,000/μ L) and/or symptomatic 
bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who are not receiving concomitant 
anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors: 
• Hold obinutuzumab until thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding resolves.  If 
Cycle 1 Day 8 is delayed, then skip Day 8 and administer Day 15 as previously scheduled 
(if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding has resolved).  If Cycle 1 Day 15 is delayed, 
then skip Day 15 dosing and administer Cycle 2 Day 1 of obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A 
as scheduled (if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding has resolved).   
 
In the event of thrombocytopenia with platelet count < 20,000/μL and/or symptomatic 
bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who are receiving concomitant 
anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors: 
• Hold obinutuzumab until thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding resolves.  If 
Cycle 1 Day 8 is delayed, then skip Day 8 an d administer Day 15 as previously scheduled (if 
thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding has resolved).  If Cycle 1 Day 15 is delayed, then 
skip Day 15 dosing and administer Cycle 2 Day 1 of obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A as scheduled (if thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding has resolved).  
• For patients who are on LMWH or NOACs, when platelet count 
< 20,000/μL 
develops, reduce the dose of LMWH or NOACs used. 
• For patients who are on platelet inhibitors when thrombocytopenia with platelet 
count < 20,000/μ L develops, consideration should be given to temporarily pausing 
the use of platelet inhibitors.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Febrile Neutropenia   
In the event of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia with infection, hold obinutuzumab until febrile 
neutropenia or neutropenia with infection resolves.   
• If Cycle 1 Day 8 is delayed long enough that the patient is approaching Day 15, then skip 
Day 8 and administer Day 15 as previously scheduled (if infection or fever has resolved) 
• If Cycle 1 Day 15 is delayed long enough that  the patient approaching Cycle 2, then skip 
Day 15 dosing and administer Cycle 2 Day 1 of DCDS4501 as scheduled (if infection or 
fever has resolved)

4.4 CONCOMITANT AND EXCLUDED THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_5165]  
4.4.1 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutriti onal 
supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to the scr eening evaluation to the 
end of study visits.  All concomitant medica tions should be reported to the investigator 
and recorded on the appropriate electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, or other maintenance therapy should continue their use.  Concomitant use of  hematopoietic growth factors is allowed 
in accordance with instructions provided in the package inserts. 
Patients who experience infusion-related temperature elevations of >
 38.5°C (> 101.3°F) 
or other minor infusion-related symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen/paracetamol ( ≥ 500 mg) and/or H1 and H2 histamine-receptor 
antagonists (e.g., diphenhydramine, ranitidine).  Serious infusion-related events manifested by [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, wheez ing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced 
oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_766130] (e.g., supplemental oxygen, β2-agonists, and/or corticosteroids) as clinically 
indicated according to standard clinical practice (see Table 1 ).   
For patients enrolled on obinutuzumab-containing regimens, it is recommended that 
corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent)  be given as premedication 
within [ADDRESS_1050803] obinutuzumab infusion, additional glucocorticoids are allowed at the investigator’s discretion.  For patients who did not experience infusion-related symptoms with their previous infusion, premedication at subsequent infusions may be omitted at the investigator’s discretion. 
Infusion reaction prophylaxis with medications (e.g., acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids) may be instituted at any point in the study if it is determined to be in the best interest of the patient on the basis of the observation of IRRs in patients already enrolled in the study.  Patients with Grade [ADDRESS_1050804] be premedicated prior to retreatment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Patients with 
hypotension requiring vasopressor support or with Grade [ADDRESS_1050805] be permanently discontinued from study treatment. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
104/P GO27834-A3 4.4.2 Excluded Therapy  
Use of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_27789]: 
• Cytotoxic chemotherapy 
• Radiotherapy 
• Immunotherapy including immunosuppressive therapy • Radioimmunotherapy 
• Hormone therapy (other than contracept ives, hormone-replacement therapy, or 
megestrol acetate) 
• Biologic agents (other than hematopoietic growth factors, which are allowed 
if clinically indicated and used in accordance with instructions provided in the 
package inserts); guidelines for the use of G-CSF are detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix F. 
• Any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766131], whether 
approved by [CONTACT_766289].  Patients who are discontinued from study treatment will be followed for safety 
outcomes for 30 days following the patient’s last dose of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A or rituximab or obinutuzumab, whichever is later, or until the patient receives another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. 
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
4.5.1 Definitions of Study Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical Hist ory and Demographics 
Medical history includes all clinically signifi cant diseases, prior cancer history, prior 
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649], and all medications used by [CONTACT_25701] 7 days 
preceding the screening visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a sitting or semi-supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], pulse oximetry, pulse rate, and body temperature.  Every effort will be made to ensure that vital signs are obtained from patients in a consistent manner and position.  The timing of vital sign collection on the days of study treatment administration is as follows: 
• For the administration of rituximab or obinutuzumab, vital signs should be 
assessed prior to the start of the infusion, every 15 (±
 5) minutes during the first hour

of the infusion, and every 30 ( ± 10) minutes for [ADDRESS_1050806]-infusion following 
dosing at Cycle 1 and 30 ( ± 10) minutes following dosing in subsequent cycles.  
Additional monitoring of vital signs should be performed if clinically indicated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination should inclu de the evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.   
Targeted physical examinations should be limited to systems of clinical relevance 
(i.e., cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and any system that might be associated with tumor assessment, such as lymph nodes, liver, and spleen) and those systems associated with symptoms. 
Changes from baseline should be recorded at each subsequent physical examination.  
New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events if appropriate. 
Resolution or any change in grade of peripheral neuropathy AEs and SAEs (with dates) 
should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification (SDV).  This also applies to AEs for which study drug was discontinued or for patients in the follow-up phase after last dose of study treatment with either ongoing AEs or new onset of an AE.  For the AEs referring to the follow-up phase newly initiated, relevant treatments need to be documented with treatment dates.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Laborat ory Assessments 
On days of study drug administration, pre- infusion laboratory samples should be drawn 
within 4 hours prior to the start of infusion, unless otherwise specified.  Local laboratory assessments may be obtained up to 72 hours prior to the start of study treatment administration (see below and Section 4.5.3).  Instruction manuals and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments. 
Central Laboratory Assessments 
Samples for flow cytometry, PK, bone marrow, and anti-DCDT2980S, anti-DCDS4501A, or anti-obinutuzumab antibody assessments will be sent to one or several laboratories or to Genentech for analyses (see Section 3.6).  The following assessments will be conducted:

the first dose of study treatment for exploratory research. 
• Tumor tissue sample (archival or fresh) will be collected from patients for central 
pathologic review as described in Section 4.1.1 and Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Local Laboratory Assessments 
Samples for hematology, serum chemistry, liver function, and pregnancy will be 
analyzed at the study site’s local laboratory.  Local laboratory assessments may be obtained up to 72 hours prior to start of study treatment administration on Day 1 of the treatment cycle.   
• Hematology:  includes complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell

107/P GO27834-A3 [IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram Assessments 
Twelve-lead digital ECG measurements will be obtained in triplicate, with immediately 
consecutive ECGs obtained until three evaluable ECGs are recorded, at the following timepoints: 
• Screening 
• 30− 60 minutes before the start of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in Cycle 1 
• 30− 60 minutes after the completion of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in 
Cycle 1 
• 30− 60 minutes after the completion of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in 
Cycle 3 
• Day 8 ( ±
 1 day) of Cycle 3 time matched (i.e., obtained at the same time of day) with 
post-DCDT2980s/DCDS4501A infusion ECGs for Cycle 3   
• Treatment completion/early termination visit 
 
Non-triplicate ECGs should also be performed when clinically indicated in any patient 
with evidence of or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_766152].  
All ECGs as described above will be submitted to a Sponsor-designated ECG central 
laboratory for storage and potential analysis.  Detailed instructions on ECG acquisitions and transmissions to the ECG central laboratory will be provided in the ECG manual provided for this study. 
Representative ECGs at each timepoint should be reviewed by [CONTACT_1720] a 
qualified designee.  Post-screening ECG measurements should be obtained as close as possible to scheduled serum and plasma PK samples (see Appendices B-1 and B-2) and should be no more than 30 minutes apart.  If QTc prolongation ( >
 500 ms and 
> 60 ms longer than the pre-dose baseline value) is noted, ECGs should be repeated 
until the prolongation is reversed or stabilized.  If a PK sample is not scheduled at the timepoint where QTc prolongation is first observed, then an unscheduled sample should be obtained.  An evaluation for potential causes of QT prolongation ⎯for 
example, electrolyte imbalances or concomitant medications ⎯should be performed, 
study treatment dosing held, and the Medical Monitor notified.  Management of QT/QTc prolongation should be performed in accordance with institutional standard of care at the discretion of the treating physician. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic and  Pharmacodynamic  Assessments 
Pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  will be characterized by [CONTACT_766237] (conjugated and unconjugated antibody), acMMAE, and free MMAE concentrations using validated methods (see Section 4.9).  Plasma samples may also be analyzed for other potential MMAE-containing catabolites, per sponsor’s discretion.  Pharmacokinetics of rituximab will be characterized by [CONTACT_766290] a validated method (see Section 4.9).  Pharmacokinetics of 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
108/P GO27834-A3 obinutuzumab will be characterized by [CONTACT_766291] a validated method (see Section 4.9).  These assessments will allow for further 
characterization of pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, the assessment of the drug interaction potential when they are given in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab, and the investigation of potential correlations between PK parameters and safety and/or activity if data allow and at the sponsor’s discretion.  Pharmacodynamics of obinutuzumab and DCS4501A may be assessed by [CONTACT_766292]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity Assessments 
The immunogenicity evaluation will utilize a risk-based strategy and tiered approach (Rosenberg and Worobec 2004a, 2004b, 2005; Koren et al. 2008) designed to detect 
and characterize all ATA responses to DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  Patient samples will first be screened to detect all antibody responses toward DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A.  Samples that screen positive will be analyzed in a confirmatory assay (competitive binding with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A) to assess the specificity of the positive response.  Titers will be determined for confirmed positive samples.  Further characterization will be assessed by [CONTACT_766293]2980S or DCDS4501A to characterize whether the ATA responses are primarily to the mAb or the linker-drug regions of the ADC.  Positive ATA samples will be stored for further characterization of ATA responses, if necessary.   
The schedule of sample collection for ATA assessment is outlined in Appendices B-[ADDRESS_1050808] all antibody responses to obinutuzumab.  Samples that screen positive will be analyzed in a confirmatory assay (competitive binding with obinutuzumab) to assess the specificity of the positive response.  The relative levels of ATA in confirmed positive samples will be determined in a titering assay.  Positive ATA samples will be stored for further characterization of ATA responses, if necessary. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Response Assessments 
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and re-assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response assessments will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], on the basis of physical examinations, CT scans, PET scans, and/or MRI scans, and bone marrow examinations, using standard response criteria for NHL 
(Cheson et al. 2007 ; Cheson et al. 2014 ) (see Appendix C-1  and C-2). 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
109/P GO27834-A3 a. Radiographic Assessments for Pa tients on Rituximab-Containing 
Arms/Cohorts 
CT scans with contrast should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis scans; CT scans of 
the neck should be performed at screening and followed only if disease is present at screening.  Post-screening radiographic assessments may be limited to areas of prior involvement only if required by [CONTACT_72952]. 
MRI scans may be used instead of CT scans in patients for whom CT scans with IV 
contrast are contraindicated.  Details regarding imaging procedures in these cases will be provided in the Imaging Manual. 
An 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose− positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) (hereafter 
referred to as PET) scan is required during screening for all patients with DLBCL.  An 
additional PET scan in DLBCL patients should be obtained at the 6-month tumor assessment to ensure consistency of response assessment methodology at this timepoint for all patients.  PET scans should additionally be obtained to confirm disappearance of metabolically active disease during study treatment and to confirm a CR upon discontinuation of study treatment.   
For patients with FL, PET scans are not required but may be obtained on the basis of 
physician preference and if permitted by [CONTACT_72952].  Similarly, for DLBCL, PET scans on patients with FL should be obtained during screening; for patients whose tumors are PET positive during screening, an additional PET scan should be obtained at the 6-month tumor assessment.  PET scans should additionally be obtained to confirm disappearance of metabolically active disease during study treatment and to confirm a CR upon discontinuation of study treatment.  
For all patients regardless of disease subtype, combined PET-CT scans may be used 
instead of CT alone if performed with contrast and if collected with resolution sufficient to allow accurate and consistent comparison of target lesion measurements with subsequent PET-CT scans.  If a PET-CT scan is to be used during screening, then PET-CT scans should be performed for all subsequent tumor assessments in order to ensure their consistency across different timepoints. 
All tumor assessments will be submitted to an IRF for storage and possible independent 
centralized review.  Details related to submission of data to the IRF will be defined in a separate Imaging Manual. 
b. Radiographic Assessments for Patien ts on Obinutuzumab-Containing 
Cohorts  
PET scans should minimally extend from skull-base to mid-thigh.  Full-body PET scan should be performed when clinically appropriate. 
CT scans with oral and IV contrast should include chest, abdomen, and pelvic scans; CT 
scans of the neck should be included if clinically indicated.  CT scans for response 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
110/P GO27834-A3 assessment may be limited to areas of prior involvement only if required by [CONTACT_405737].  At the investigator’s discretion, CT scans may be repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected. 
In patients for whom contrast is contraindicated
⎯for example, patients with contrast 
allergy or impaired renal CL ⎯CT or combined PET/CT scans without contrast are 
permitted so long as they permit consistent and precise measurement of target lesions 
during the study treatment period.   
PET and CT scans are required for follicular NHL and DLBCL patients at screening, after 
Cycle 4 of study treatment (i.e., between Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1), and at EOT.  The EOT response assessment should be performed 6
−[ADDRESS_1050809] scans without PET scans will be obtained every 
6 months for 2  year s, with use of Lugano 2014  Response C riteria for NHL 
(see Appendix C-2).   
c. Bone Marrow Assessments 
A bone marrow biopsy for morphology is required at screening and should reflect 
disease status in the bone marrow following documented relapse on the last prior 
therapy or within 3 months of Day 1, whichever occurs later.  For obinutuzumab-containing 
cohorts, only follicular NHL patients are required to undergo a bo ne marrow biopsy at screening.   
If the bone marrow biopsy at screening demonstrates presence of tumor cells, 
a subsequent bone marrow examination is required only to confirm a CR or if clinically indicated.  If the bone marrow biopsy at screening does not demonstrate presence of tumor cells, then subsequent bone marrow examination is required only if clinically indicated. 
d. Schedule of Tumor Response Asses sments for Rituximab-Containing 
Arms/Cohorts 
Tumor response assessments will be performed every 3 months ( ± 1 week) from the 
initiation of study treatment until study treatment completion or early termination (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1050810] eight 21-day cycles of treatment).  The schedule of tumor assessments is independent of the study treatment dose schedule.  For patients enrolled on rituximab-containing arms/cohorts, the schedule of tumor response assessments is detailed in Appendix A-1.  As stated above, for all DLBCL patients enrolled on a rituximab-containing arm/cohort, PET scans are required during the screening period and at the 6-month tumor assessment timepoint. 
The schedule for tumor response assessments for patients who proceed to crossover 
treatment is detailed in Appendix A-2.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
111/P GO27834-A3 Additional response assessments, after the final dose of study treatment, for patients 
who discontinue from study treatment (either initial or crossover treatment) for reasons other than progressive disease, will be performed as described in Appendix A-[ADDRESS_1050811] study drug infusion (both initial and crossover treatment) at the treatment completion/early termination visit.  Imaging scans are not required at the treatment completion/early termination visit if scans have been performed wi thin the previous [ADDRESS_1050812] scan at screening, after Cycle 4 of treatment, and at EOT.  The schedule for tumor response assessments for patients enrolled on obinutuzumab-containing cohorts is detailed in Appendix A-3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Explor atory Research 
a. Tumor Tissue Samples 
Required Tumor Tissue Samples  
Tumor tissue samples will be used for central pathologic laboratory review of CD20, 
CD22, and CD79b expression.  Additional studies to fulfill the exploratory objectives in Section 3.3.4 will be performed, including, but not limited, to the following: 
• Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling for signatures of NHL biology, 
including prognostic subpopulations (Alizadeh et al. 2000; Wright et al. 2003), target 
expression (CD20, CD22 and CD79b), and apoptotic response  
• Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from cores taken from provided blocks for 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assessments 
for biomarker endpoints involved in response to chemotherapy including quantitation 
of Bcl-2 protein and genetic alterations of bcl-2 including gene rearrangements, amplifications, and t(14;18) translocations. Additional IHC markers may include 
those related to the tumor microenvironment. 
• Tumor DNA to assess mutations that have been shown to be associated with NHL 
biology and activation of the B-cell receptor, including mutations in CD79b 
(Pasqualucci et al. 2011) 
 
For patients who develop progressive disease and are eligible to receive crossover 
treatment (see Section 3.1.8), a biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease will be performed.  Tumor tissue samples obtained at this timepoint will be used to assess changes in biology, target expression, and regulators of apoptosis as described above, which have occurred and may be linked to progression on initial study treatment. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
112/P GO27834-A3 Optional Tumor Tissue Samples (Requires Optional Research Informed 
Consent  
For patients who provide informed consent, an optional tumor biopsy will be collected at 
time of progression from the following patients: 
• Patients who develop disease progression following initial study treatment and do 
not proceed to receive crossover treatment 
• Patients who develop disease progression on crossover treatment 
 
Tumor tissue samples obtained at these timepoints will be used to assess changes in 
biology, target expression, and regulators of  apoptosis, as described above, that have 
occurred and may be linked to progression on treatment. 
b. Blood and Plasma Samples 
A plasma sample will be collected prior to treatment. 
Blood samples will be taken aligned with PK sampling to assess the pharmacodynamics 
response by [CONTACT_766244]. 
For patients who sign the Optional Research Informed Consent, an additional blood 
sample will also be taken prior to treatment. 
The plasma and blood samples may be used for the assessment of specific tumor 
biologic markers, including proteins, circulating DNA, and microRNAs.  The information obtained from these samples will enable a better understanding of the biology of NHL and disease prognosis, identify potential predictors of response to treatment with DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab, and/or obinutuzumab, improve di agnostic 
assessments, and identify and characterize mechanisms of resistance to DCDT2980S or 
DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab activity.   
Because tumorigenesis is a multiple-step process linked to somatic events, any DNA 
analysis will focus on sporadic mutations specifically found in tumor tissue and not on inherited changes found in the whole body.  For this purpose, some tumor-containing sections may be taken from the tissue block and used for the DNA extraction process.  Assays on stored tissue samples may be performed at Genentech or at a central specialty laboratory.

119/P GO27834-A3 parameters will be tabulated and summarized (mean, standard deviation, and range).  
Non-compartmental, compartmental, and/or population methods will be used, as data allow.  
Exposure-response (safety and efficacy) analys is may be conducted with use of PK data 
and available drug effect (e.g., imaging, measures of tumor burden) and toxicity 
(e.g., clinical pathology) data, at the sponsor’s discretion. 
In addition, population PK methods may be employed to manage sparse data and to 
investigate the effects of certain covariates on the pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, as data allow, and at the sponsor’s discretion. 
4.10.[ADDRESS_1050831] overall response, duration of response, and PFS will be listed for all patients. 
ORR from the initial study treatment will be calculated on the basis of data from patients 
who received study treatment.  Objective response is defined as CR or PR as determined by [CONTACT_093], on the basis of physical examinations, radiographic scans, and bone marrow examinations, using modified response criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007; see Appendix C) and confirmed by [CONTACT_294862] ≥
 4 weeks 
after initial documentation.  Any patient with insufficient data to determine response will be classified as a non-responder. 
For patients with DLBCL, primary assessment of tumor response will be based on 
diagnostic imaging scans ⎯for example, CT and/or MRI scans and PET scans.  For 
patients with FL enrolled on rituximab-containing arms/cohorts, primary assessment of response will be based on CT scans only; the assessment of response in FL based on PET scans will be performed for exploratory purposes only. 
For patients on obinutuzumab-containing cohorts, primary response assessment for both 
DLBCL and FL will be based on PET/CT scans  using the updated 2014 Lugano 
Response Criteria  as determined by [CONTACT_147075]  (IRC).  Patients 
in Cohorts E, G, and H will be evaluated with a PET -CT scan at screening, between 
Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1, and at the end of treatment ( 6-8 weeks after 
completing treatment ).  The efficacy analysis for these cohorts will, therefore, be 
different from the analysis for Arms A-B and Cohorts C-D (Cheson, et al 2014) 
(see Appendix C-2).   Subsequent imaging can be CT only.  Responses to study 
treatment will also be  based on invest igator assessments.  
Among patients with an objective response, duration of response will be defined as the 
time from the initial documentation of a CR or PR to the time of disease progression or death.  If a patient does not experience death or disease progression before the end of the study, duration of response will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
120/P GO27834-A3 For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), PFS is defined as the time from 
the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  If a patient has not experienced progressive disease or death, PFS will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.  Patients with no 
post-baseline tumor assessment will be censored on the date of randomization.  For the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C through H), PFS is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), OS is defined as the time from 
the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.  For the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C thro ugh H), OS is defi ned as the time from the date of 
study enrollment to date of death from any cause. 
4.10.5 Exploratory Analyses  
Assay results of possible predictive markers will be listed by [CONTACT_766294]. 
Frequencies and percentages of missing data for the PRO endpoints will be reported.  Dropouts 
(defined as patients withdrawing from treatment for reasons other than documented disease progression or death) will be summarized 
Summary statistics of the MDASI items, scales, and their changes from baseline will be 
calculated at each assessment timepoint.  The mean, standard error, and median of the absolute scores and the mean changes from baseline (and 95% CI) within and between study arms will be reported for the MDASI scale s and single items, as well as the weekly 
averages of the worst symptom rating.  For change scores in the MDASI from baseline, patients without baseline scores will not be included in the analyses.  Line charts depi[INVESTIGATOR_260293].

4.10.7 Determination of Sample Size  
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), a target of 120 patients will be enrolled in two separate cohorts of patients (40 in the follicular NHL cohort and 80 in the DLBCL cohort).  The randomized portion of this st udy is non-comparative in nature.  No 
formal hypothesis testing is planned to compar e the treatment arms.  Moreover, there is 
insufficient power to detect minimum clinically meaningful differences between the two treatment arms.  Genentech has judged the proposed sample size to provide sufficient precision in estimating the anti-tumor activi ty of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab or 
DCDS4501A combined with rituximab as measured by [CONTACT_33966].  For example, 
with the assumption of an observed response rate of 40%, a 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be approximately 22% −58% (i.e., 40% ±  18%) for the follicular 
NHL cohort and approximately 27% −53% (i.e., 40% ±  13%) for the DLBCL cohort.  With 
40 patients, there is an 87% chance of observing at least one adverse event with a true incidence of 5%. 
For the non-randomized portions of the study (Cohorts C and D), approximately 
20 patients will be enrolled into each arm, for a total of 40 patients.  With 20 patients under an observed response rate of 40%, the exact Clopper-Pearson 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be 22%
−61%.  With respect to the assessment of 
safety based upon a sample size of [ADDRESS_1050833] one adverse event with a true incidence of 10% is 88%. 
For the obinutuzumab safety run-in cohort (Cohort E), 6 patients will be enrolled.  For the 
obinutuzumab expansion cohorts (Cohorts G and H), 40 patients with follicular NHL, and 40 patients with DLBCL will be enrolled at the RP2D to further evaluate safety and efficacy of the combination.  Table 3  provides asymptotic 90% confidence intervals for 
the true probability of response for a range of observed proportions based upon a 
sample of 40 patients.  A sample size of 40 patients is deemed sufficient to provide 
adequate precision on the point estimate and for the lower end of the 90% CI to rule out 
a clinically uninteresting rate of 45% assuming observed response rates of 
approximately 60% or higher (~24 responders observed among 40 patients).

Genentech will perform oversight of the data management of this trial.  Genentech will 
produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central Laboratory data and other
 electronic data will be sent 
directly to Genentech, using Genentech’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.  eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  System backups for data stored at Genentech and records retention for the study data will be consistent with Genentech’s standard procedures. 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY

Genentech or its designee is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the Competent 
Authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, European Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC), and/or local regulatory requirements. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
123/P GO27834-A3 Genentech or its designee is responsible for reporting unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening events associated with the use of the study drug to the regulatory agencies and competent authorities by [CONTACT_144530] 7 calendar days after being notified of the event.  Genentech or its designee will report other relevant SAEs 
associated with the use of the study medication to the appropriate competent authorities (according to local guidelines), investigators, and central Institutional Review Board/ethics committee (IRBs/ECs, except in the [LOCATION_002] where investigators ar e 
responsible for reporting to their IRBs per local requirements) by a written safety report within 15 calendar days of notification.   
5.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. 
This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol-specified 
AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with the baseline 
hematologic malignancy (i.e., leukemia or lymphoma) that were not present prior to the AE reporting period (see Section 5.2.1) 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions 
(e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
• AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a 
protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., medication washout, no treatment run-in, or 
invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
• Preexisting medical conditions other than the disease under study that are
 judged 
by [CONTACT_657161]-specified AE reporting period 
 
5.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that is any of the following: 
• Fatal (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death) 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
the investigational product(s) 
• Considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
124/P GO27834-A3  
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs. 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous .  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an AE (as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and 
SAEs on the eCRF.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_1050836] (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_547479] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions), irrespective of regulatory seriousness criteria.  Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
[CONTACT_25742]’s law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]; treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × baseline value 
in combination with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN [of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin]) 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] , as defined below: 
Any organism, virus, or infectious part icle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only  
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected. 
• Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) of any grade, irrespective of causality  
 
5.2 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs (as defined in 
Section 5.1) are recorded on the eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with protocol instructions.  
5.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs caused by a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g., SAEs related to invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run-in). 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
125/P GO27834-A3 After initiation of study drug (the Genentech product(s) or other IMP), all new AEs and 
SAEs regardless of attribution will be collected until [ADDRESS_1050837] administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is later.  After this period, investigators should report only SAEs that are felt to be related to prior study treatment (see Section 5.6).   
5.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all patient evaluation timepoints should be adopted.  Exam ples of non-directive questions include: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1050838].  All AEs 
and SAEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_766295], will 
be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
For each AE and SAE recorded on the applicable eCRF, the investigator will make an 
assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.1.2 for seriousness criteria), severity, and causality.   
Table [ADDRESS_1050839](s).  
The AE grading (severity) scale found in the NCI CTCAE v4.0 will be used for AE

Note:  Regardless of severity, some events ma y also meet regulatory serious criteria.  
Refer to definitions of an SAE (see Section 5.1.2). 
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or 
reported AE is not in the NCI CTCAE listing.  
To ensure consistency of causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guidelines: 
Table 5  Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the AE/SAE suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_362241], 
evidence, science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product administration 
makes a causal relationship possible, A ND other drugs, therapeutic interventions 
or underlying conditions do not provide sufficient explanation for the AE/SAE.   
NO The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product administration 
makes a causal relationship unlikely, OR other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the AE/SAE.   
AE=adverse event; SAE=serious adverse event.  
The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the “Yes” or “No” causality assessment for individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators and applicable regulatory authorities.

127/P GO27834-A3 5.[ADDRESS_1050840] medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or 
SAEs on the eCRF.  Avoid co lloquialisms and abbreviations. 
There is one eCRF page for recording AEs or SAEs. 
Only one medical concept should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnos is or syndrome at the time of reporting, 
each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  
However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hem orrhage leads to renal failure, both events 
should be recorded separately on the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once in the eCRF unless their severity increases.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it should be recorded again on the Adverse Event eCRF.   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
128/P GO27834-A3 [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management, 
e.g., concomitant medication, will be recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF 
(e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.) 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5
 × ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term 
should be recorded as the AE or SAE.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Specific to this study, lymphopenia and l eukopenia due to lymphopenia of any grade are 
expected PD effects of study drug and therefore are not considered to be AEs.  
However, complications of lymphopenia (e.g., infections) will need to be reported as AEs.  In addition, because monocytopenia is not reportable and neutropenia is already being monitored and reported as an AE, leukopenia does not need to be reported as a distinct AE. 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF, unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE.  A vital sign result must be reported as an AE if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (including a diagnostic evaluation not mandated in 
this protocol) or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an AE. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
129/P GO27834-A3 Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin (>  2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  Therefore, investigators must report as an AE the occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN (of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin) 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours aft er learning of 
the event), either as an SAE or a non-serious adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
Deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period (see Section 5.2.1 ) that are attributed by [CONTACT_766296].  All other on-study deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor. 
When recording a death on an eCRF, the event or condition that caused or contributed 
to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such 
conditions should be recorded on the Medical and Surgical History eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if  the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent
 headaches”).

lymphoma) should not  be recorded as an AE or SAE.  These data will be captured as 
efficacy assessment data only.

There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766137].  These scenarios include a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281914]: 
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study 
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a preexisting medical 
condition that has not changed 
• Receive scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
If a female patient becomes pregnant while receiving the study drug or within [ADDRESS_1050841] dose of study treatmen t, a Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed 
within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy report will automatically be 
generated and sent to Genentech’s Drug Safety Department or its designee.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Male patients must also be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if their 
partner becomes pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_1050842] dose of 
study drug.  If such an event occurs, it should be reported as described below. 
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should always be classified as an SAE 
(as the Sponsor considers these medically significant), recorded on an Adverse Event eCRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2). 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed 
to study drug should be classified as an SAE, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2). 
After the study period, abortions, congenital anomalies/birth defects, and pregnancy 
outcomes should still be reported expeditiously to the Sponsor.   
In the event the EDC system is unava ilable, a paper Pregnancy Report form and 
Pregnancy Fax Coversheet should be completed and faxed to Genentech’s Drug Safety Department or its designee within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy, at the fax numbers listed in Section 5.4.2.

If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language. 
All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in each patient’s study file and must 
be available for verification by [CONTACT_9534]. 
The Informed Consent Form should be revised whenever there are changes to 
procedures outlined in the informed consent or  when new information becomes available 
that may affect the willingness of the patient to participate. 
For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history for each patient shall 
document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained for the updated/revised Consent Form for continued participation in the study.  The final revised IRB/EC-approved Informed Consent Form must be provided to Genentech for regulatory purposes. 
If the site utilizes a separate Authorization Form for patient authorization to use and 
disclose personal health information under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, the review, approval, and other processes 
outlined above apply except that IRB/IEC review and approval may not be required per study site policies. 
Optional Research Informed Consent 
Informed consent for the collection and use of fresh tumor tissue at time of progression for optional research described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be documented in a section of the main Informed Consent Form.  This section provides patients with the option to authorize 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
136/P GO27834-A3 the collection and use of these samples and personal health information for additional 
research purposes.  Agreement to participate in the optional research (by [CONTACT_766298]) is not required for enrollment in the trial but is required prior to any optional research sample collection.  Optional consent may be withdrawn at any time by [CONTACT_102]. 
6.[ADDRESS_1050850] be submitted to the IRB/EC b y the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_766155].  In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25685]/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the regulatory requirements and policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol changes or amendments and of any unanticipated problem s involving risk to human patients 
or others. 
In addition to the requirements to report protocol-defined AEs to the Sponsor, 
investigators are required to promptly
 report to their respective IRB/EC all unanticipated 
problems involving risk to human patients.  Some IRBs/ECs may want prompt notification of all SAEs, whereas others require notification only about events that are serious, assessed to be related to study treatment, and are unexpected.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety-related communications from Genentech.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements and with the policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and archived in the site’s Study File.  
6.[ADDRESS_1050851] site facilities and equipment, study source data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_766156] c onduct of this protocol 
and permit G enentech monitors/representatives and collaborators, the FDA, other 
regulatory agencies, Institutional Review Boards, and the respective national or local health authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 
6.6 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS 
eCRFS are to be completed using the  EDC 
system.  Sites will receive training for appropriate eCRF completion.  eCRFs will be submitted electronically to Genentech and should be handled in accordance with instructions from Genentech. 

 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
137/P GO27834-A3 All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_25755], trained personnel or the study 
coordinator as appropriate.  The eCRF should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. 
In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her 
site in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records. 
6.7 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents are where original patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, certified accurate and 
complete copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Original source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of 
data entered into the eCRFs must never be obliterated or destroyed. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigator(s) and institution(s) must provide the Sponsor direct 
access to all applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_112103]. 
6.8 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the sour ce document if the system has been validated 
in accordance with FDA requirements per taining to computerized systems used in 
clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system (for clinical research purposes) would be one that (1) allows data entry only by [CONTACT_4539]; (2) prevents the deletion or alteration of previously entered data and provides an audit trail for such data changes (e.g., modification of file); (3) protects the database from tampering; and (4) ensures data preservation. 
In collaboration with the study monitor, Genentech’s Quality Assurance group may assist 
in assessing whether electronic records generated from computerized medical record systems used at investigational sites can serve as source documents for the purposes of this protocol. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
138/P GO27834-A3 If a site’s computerized medical record system is not adequately validated for the 
purposes of clinical research (as opposed to general clinical practice), applicable hardcopy source documents must be maintained to ensure that critical protocol data entered into the eCRFs can be verified. 
6.9 STUDY MEDICATION ACCOUNTABILITY 
All study drug required for completion of this study will be provided by [CONTACT_8229].  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_27834].  Damaged supplies will be replaced. 
Accurate records of all study drug received at, dispensed from, returned to and disposed 
of by [CONTACT_473501]. 
Study drug will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s 
institutional standard operating procedure or returned to Genentech with the appropriate documentation, as determined by [CONTACT_3452] .  If the study site chooses to destroy 
study drug, the method of destruction must be documented. 
Genentech must evaluate and approve the study site’s drug destruction standard 
operating procedure prior to the initiation of drug destruction by [CONTACT_3452]. 
6.[ADDRESS_1050852] parties as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate authorization to use and disclose personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_9536]. 
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare for treatment purposes. 
Data generated by [CONTACT_27961], national and local health authorities, Genentech monitors/representativ es and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for 
each study site, if appropriate. 
6.11 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) and the ICH Guideline for GCP (see Section 4.9 of the guideline) require that records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational drug, including eCRFs, consent forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_8178] [ADDRESS_1050853].

Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL 
Adapted from:  Cheson BD, Pfistner B, Juweid ME, et al. Revised Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma. J Clin Oncol 2007;25:579–86. 
Selection of Indicator (Target) Lesions  
Up to six of the largest dominant nodes or tumor masses selected according to all of the following: 
• Clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions 
Abnormal lymph nodes are those that are either 
>
 [ADDRESS_1050891] transverse diameter (GTD) regardless of the short axis 
diameter, or 
> 10 mm in short axis diameter regardless of long axis 
• If possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body. 
• Should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites 
are involved 
• Extranodal lesions within the liver or spleen must be at least 1.0 cm in 
two perpendicular dimensions. 
 
PET Scans--Definition of a Positive PET scan  
Visual assessment currently is considered adequate for determining whether a PET scan is 
positive, and use of the standardized uptake value is not necessary.  In brief, a positive scan is defined as focal or diffuse FDG uptake above background in a location incompatible with normal anatomy or physiology, without a specific standardized uptake value cutoff.  Other causes of false-positive scans should be ruled out.  Exceptions include mild and diffusely 
increased FDG uptake at the site of moderate or large-sized masses with an intensity that is lower than or equal to the mediastinal blood pool, hepatic or splenic nodules 1.5 cm with FDG uptake lower than the surrounding liver/spleen uptake, and diffusely increased bone marrow uptake within weeks after treatment. 
Complete Remission (CR)  
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease 
and disease-related symptoms if present prior to therapy.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid lymphoma: in patients with no pre-treatment PET scan or when 
the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any 
size is permitted as long as it is PET negative. 
Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, the designation

Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
166/P GO27834-A3 of CR requires all nodal indicator lesions to regress to the size of normal lymph 
nodes.  Lymph nodes that were > [ADDRESS_1050892] regress to ≤  15 mm in GTD 
regardless of the short axis diameter.  Lymph nodes that were 11 to 15 mm in GTD and >
 [ADDRESS_1050893] 
regress to ≤ 10 mm in the short axis diameter. 
2. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged prior to therapy on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be 
considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to lymphoma should disappear.  However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable 
because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an 
enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma. 
3. If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_248287], the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy.  The biopsy sample on which this determination 
is made must be adequate ( >
 20 mm unilateral core).  If the sample is indeterminate by

Partial Remission (PR)  
1. ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to [ADDRESS_1050894] 
dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes or masses should be selected 
according to the following: (a) they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 
perpendicular dimensions; (b) if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; (c) they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever 
these sites are involved. 
2. No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen. 
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥
 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, 
in the greatest transverse diameter. 
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present. 
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive prior to treatment.  However, if positive, the cell type should be specified 
(e.g., large-cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells).  Patients who achieve a complete 
remission by [CONTACT_86950], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow 
involvement will be considered partial responders. 
6. No new sites of disease should be observed (e.g., nodes > 1.5 cm in any axis). 
7. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma : for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the

least one previously involved site. 
8. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown : for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be used. 
2. In patients with follicular lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated with one or at most 
two residual masses that have regressed by [CONTACT_726] 50% on CT; those with more than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be considered 
partial responders. 
Stable Disease (SD)  
1. Failing to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but not fulfilling those for progressive 
disease (see below). 
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphomas : the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with 
no new areas of involvement on the post- treatment CT or PET. 
3. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown : for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size 
of the previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan. 
Relapsed Disease (RD; after CR) or Progressive Disease (PD; for Patients 
with PR or SD)  
1. Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is >  1.5 cm, regardless of 
the short axis.  If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 −1.5 cm, it should only be 
considered abnormal if its short axis is > 1.0.  Lymph nodes ≤  1.0 cm by ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1050895] a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD  of any previously involved nodes, or in a

RATIONALE 
Protocol GO27834 has been amended to enable the following changes: 
• Obinutuzumab, a novel type II and glyc oengineered anti-CD20 antibody, is currently 
being compared with rituximab in two large Phase III studies in patients with diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (iNHL), 
potentially altering the standard of care in NHL.   A Phase Ib/II portion of the study 
will be added using obinutuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin 
(DCDS4501A).  Initially, a safety run-in of 6 patients with either relapsed or 
refractory follicular NHL or DLBCL will be treated with DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in 
combination with obinutuzumab (denoted as Cohort E).  Only patients in the [LOCATION_002] will participate in this portion of the study. If this cohort safely clears, 
the expansion portion of the study will furt her evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
clinical activity of DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in 
patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL or DLBCL.  The expansion cohorts 
will contain 40 patients for each histology, follicular NHL or DLBCL (denoted 
Cohorts G and H).  Only investigator sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada will participate in this portion of the study. 
• For obinutuzumab-containing cohorts (Cohorts E , G, and  H), PET/CT scans will be 
required for both follicular NHL and DLBCL at screening, interim response assessment (between Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1), and end of treatment (EOT) assessment.  In the post-treatment follow-up period, patients will be followed 
for response for up to [ADDRESS_1050904] infusion of study treatment. 
• The response criteria for NHL have been updated in Appendix C-2. 
• DCDT2980S is also known as pi[INVESTIGATOR_766162]2980S throughout this protocol. 
• DCDS4501A is also known as polatuzumab vedotin and will be referred to as 
DCDS4501A throughout this protocol.  
• Arms A and B are no longer open and no longer enrolling patients. 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.

SECTION 1.2.4:  Obinutuzumab  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Mechanism of Action  
Obinutuzumab ([G], also known as RO5072759, GA101, Gazyva ™, and Gazyvaro ™) is 
a humanized type II and glycoe ngineered anti-CD20 MAb, de rived by [CONTACT_177205] B-Ly1 mouse antibody and subs equent glycoengineering leading to the 
following characteristic s (Mössner et al. 2010; Golay et al. 2013): 
• High-affinity binding to CD20 antigen on B cells 
• Type II binding mode to the CD20 antigen, leading to a more even distribution of 
bound antibody to the surface membrane of the B cell due to lack of CD20 
translocation into lipid rafts after antibody binding and low complement activation and low complement-dependent cytotoxicity related to the recognition of the CD20 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]  
• Compared with the type I anti-CD20 antibodies rituximab or ofatumumab, 
increased ADCC and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) 
related to an improved binding of obinutuzumab to the different allotypes of 
Fc
γRIIIa and Fc γRIIIb  expressed by [CONTACT_113921] (NK) cells , 
monocytes/macrophage s and neutrophils 
• Compared with rituximab, increased direct cell-death induction related to an elbow 
hinge amino exchange of the Fab region and type II binding of the CD20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_766163] [ADDRESS_1050905] udy BO21004 for patients with relapsed

4/P GO27834-A2  Summ progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS), and duration of response 
(DOR) (Goede et al. 2014). 
Obinutuzumab is currently being explored in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies 
such as aggressive and indolent lymphomas (DLBCL, FL, and marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]).  Preliminary data suggest possible increased anti-lymphoma efficacy over rituximab, a hypothesis that is  currently being explored in  several random ized trials, 
including a Phase III study of R-CHOP versus G-CHOP in first-line treatment of DLBCL, a Phase III study of R-chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine) followed 
by [CONTACT_766218] G-chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine) followed by [CONTACT_766219]-line treatment of FL and MZL, and a Phase III study of obinutuzum ab combined with bendamustine compared 
with bendamustine in patients with rituximab-refractory indolent NHL. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Toxicology  
The nonclinical toxicology of obinutuzumab has been evaluated in repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys given weekly IV (30-minute infusion) up to 26 weeks in 
duration and weekly SC injections for 4 we eks in duration.  The high dose of 50 mg/kg 
in the 26-week study resulted in a steady-state area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC
0−24) exposure of 341,000 μg•hr/mL, which is approximately 
61-fold above that of the clinical exposure of 5584 μg•hr/mL. 
Consistent with expected pharmacologic activity, obinutuzumab caused marked decreases in B cells, with corresponding lymp hoid depletion in spleen and lymph nodes.  
Circulating CD40-positive mature B cells began to reverse after several months without treatment and maxima lly reversed to 7%
−152% of baseline by 37 weeks.  In addition, 
transient decreases in NK cells were observed; this finding is consistent with the pharmacologic effect of Fc
γRIIIa binding.  Suspected opportunistic infections in as 
many as three unscheduled deaths were considered a possible secondary result of B-cell depletion. 
Obinutuzumab was immunogenic in the cy nomolgus monkey, which led to reduced 
systemic exposures in several animals and abrogation of the pharmacologic activity.  
Hypersensitivity reactions were noted that included systemic inflammation and infiltrates consistent with immune complex
−mediated hypersensitivity reactions such 
as arteritis/periarteritis, glomerulonephr itis, and serosal/adventitial inflammation and 
led to unscheduled termination in six animals. 
Both the clinical IV formulation and the SC  formulation of obinutuzumab were locally 
well tolerated across studies.  No effects were present in male and female reproductive 
parameters included in the 26-week IV dose study.  No obinutuzumab-related effects were observed on CNS, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or cardiovascular function. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
5/P GO27834-A2  Summ In vitro assays using undiluted human whol e blood measured significant increases in 
cytokine secretion caused by [CONTACT_766286], indicating that obinutuzumab has an 
increased propensity to trigger first infusion −related cytokine release in patients. 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Efficacy  
Obinutuzumab has in vivo efficacy superior to rituximab in various human lymphoma xenograft models.  Both antibodies were tested in human SUDHL-4 cells (DLBCL model) injected subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice.  Rituximab administration was started when  tumors were esta blished and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_766122].  Results showed that rituximab at 10 mg/kg inhibited tumor growth compared with rituximab at 1 mg/kg; however, increasi ng the rituximab dose to 30 mg/kg did not 
result in increased efficacy and rituximab was not able to achieve complete tumor 
regression.  In contrast, obin utuzumab showed a dose-depen dent increase in efficacy in 
the range of 1
−30 mg/kg.  Results showed complete tumor regression in all animals and 
lasting tumor eradication in [ADDRESS_1050906] dose of 30 mg/kg and in 1 of 10 animals at a dose of 10 mg/kg. 
In another experiment, SUDHL4 xenografts in SCID mice were first treated with 
weekly rituximab 30 mg/kg.  When the tumors became refractory to rituximab (Day 35), rituximab treatment was contin ued or changed to either weekly vehicle 
control or obinutuzumab 30 mg/kg.  While tumors in control- and rituximab-treated 
mice continued to grow, obinutuzumab-treated mice showed control of tumor growth and lived until Day [ADDRESS_1050907] also shown similar results, with obinutuzumab treatment 
controlling tumor growth, whereas vehicle- and rituximab-treated tumors were not controlled (Mössner et al. 2010). 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Clinical Experience  
As of July 2013, more than [ADDRESS_1050908] 
been treated with obinutuzumab in clinical trials.  Clinical data for obinutuzumab are 
available from six clinical trials, including three Phase I and Phase II studies of 
obinutuzumab monotherapy, a Phase Ib chemotherapy combination study in NHL (Study BO21000), and two Phase III studies (Study BO21004 in CLL and Study GAO4753g in NHL). 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs), mostly Grades [ADDRESS_1050909] infusion, generally occurring early during the infusion, shortly after the infusion, 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
6/P GO27834-A2  Summ or, in some cases, up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion.  In a few patients, 
concurrent signs of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were observed.  The incidence and intensity of IRRs decreased strongly with subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab.  On the basis of preliminary observations, extensive tumor burden, tumor factors, and host factors may be predisposing factors for the occurrence of IRRs.  The frequency and severity of IRRs is also reduced in lymphomas compared with CLL. 
Other frequently observed adverse events include infections and neutropenia.

reported with obinutuzumab, associated predominantly with treatment of CLL rather than NHL.  Given its anticipated mode of action, which results in profound B-cell depletion, obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections during and after treatment. 
Data from Study BO20999 (obinutuzumab monotherapy) showed safety and efficacy of 
single-agent obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed indolent and aggressive lymphomas.  Respons es were seen at both lower (400 mg) and higher (1600/800 mg) 
doses, although responses increased at the higher dose, with 54% of patients with indolent lymphoma and 32% of patients with  aggressive lymphomas showing PR or CR 
at the end of treatment (EOT) (Morschhaus er et al. 2013; Salles et al. 2013).   
Study BO21000 (Phase Ib) evaluated obinutuzum ab in combination with chemotherapy:  
obinutuzumab with fludarabine and cyclop hosphamide and obinutuzumab with CHOP 
(Radford et al. 2013).  Both chemotherapy co mbinations were shown to be feasible in 
patients with previously untreated or relapsed or refractory FL, with response rates of 
> 90% for both regimens.  Safety was acceptable, with no new or unexpected adverse 
events observed.  The most common adverse event was neutropenia. 
Data from obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in CLL (Phase III 
Study BO21004) showed increased ef ficacy of this combination over 
rituximab-chlorambucil, with a hazard ratio of 0.39 for PFS.  IRRs were common 
(65% all grades, 20% Grade 3 −4, no fatal IRRs) and neutropenia occurred at increased 
frequency with the combination therapy (33% Grade 3 −5), but there was no increase in 
infections or treatment-related deaths (Goede et al. 2014). 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on the clinical studies. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
A two-compartment model comprising a time-varying CL pathway and a linear CL pathway provides an adequate description of the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab following IV administration in Study BO20999 and Stud y BO21003.  Following the 
infusion of obinutuzumab, the elimination appears to be characterized by a linear CL pathway that is dependent on time (i.e., st arting at a typi[INVESTIGATOR_27797] 630 mL/day and 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
7/P GO27834-A2  Summ then gradually decreasing to an asymptote of 60 mL/day at steady state).  Tumor 
burden may potentially contribute significantly to the CL of obinutuzumab, especially at the beginning of treatment  when CD20-positive tumor cells are most abundant.  As 
tumor burden decreases, the CL reaches an asymptote, which is considered to be primarily a function of the proteolytic metabolic CL.  Some patients with a high tumor burden may appear to clear the drug from the plasma faster than patients with a low tumor burden because obinutuzumab binds to the CD20-positive tumor cells and is effectively removed from the plasma.  The CL  of the drug will vary with time because 
repeated treatments with obinutuzumab will reduce the quantity of CD20-positive tumor cells.  The number of times obinutuzum ab is administered during the first cycle 
of treatment may be expected to reduce the number of CD20-positive tumor cells, thus minimizing the impact of the time-varyin g CL pathway on obinutuzumab exposure. 
Treatment with obinutuzumab resulted in extensive B-cell depletion, with all patients showing a reduction in B-cell counts to absolute zero at some stage of their treatment cycle.  Overall, there has been no notable increase in complement levels before and after infusion, but transient increases occurring du ring the administration of obinutuzumab 
have been observed in the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-
α, interleukin (IL)-6, 
IL-8, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)- γ. 
SECTION 1.3:  RATIONALE FOR DOING THIS STUDY  
The goals of this Phase  II study are to continue to assess the safety, tolerability, and 
biologic and clinical activity of the combinations of DCDT2980S and rituximab and DCDS4501A and rituximab in two specific NHL patient populations:  patients with 
relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.  An 
additional goal of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and potential biologic 
and clinical activity of DCDS4501A in comb ination with obinutuz umab, an anti-CD20 
antibody, in the aforementioned NHL patient populations.  These patients continue to 
have an extremely poor prognosis with no cura tive options available.  Consequently, 
new therapeutic options are needed.   
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A and
, rituximab,  and obinutuzumab each target antigens 
specific to B-cell malignancies including follicular NHL and DLBCL (see Figures 1 
and 2).  
The randomized component of the Phase II study design permits an assessment of the 
clinical benefit provided by [CONTACT_766220], which 
has established clinical activity in B- cell malignancies both as monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy.  Data from this study will help inform the feasibility of the combination regimens in earlier lines of therapy (e.g., as first-line therapy in newly diagnosed patients).   
The non-randomized component of the study will further evaluate the safety and 
tolerability and clinical activity of DCDS 4501A in combination wi th obinutuzumab in 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
8/P GO27834-A2  Summ patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma or DLBCL and will also 
provide preliminary evidence as to which anti-CD20 agent, rituximab or obinutuzumab, in combination with DCDS4501A, provides a better benefit-risk profile 
in the target population being studied.  
Given the relatively poor prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies that have failed standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the nonclinical toxicity profile associated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A treatm ent, and the clinical safety profile 
observed to date for both ADCs, the benefit-risk ratio of a clinical study of DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A, each combined with rituximab or obinutuzumab , is considered 
acceptable. 
SECTION 1.3.2:  Rationale for Assessing DCDS4501A in Combination 
with Obinutuzumab in Relapsed or Refractory NHL  
The development of next-generation anti-CD20 −directed therapy may further enhance 
the efficacy of current standard regimens for NHL.  Obinutuzumab, also known as 
RO5072759, GA101, and Gazyva ™/Gazyvaro ™, a novel type II and glycoengineered 
anti-CD20 antibody, has shown superiority over rituximab in a Phase III trial in first-line CLL (Goede et al. 2014).  Obinutuzumab is cu rrently being compared with 
rituximab in two large Phase III studies in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL (Study BO21005) and with previous ly untreated iNHL, including FL 
(Study BO21223).  Assuming these studies de monstrate grea ter clinical benefit with 
obinutuzumab- vs. rituximab-containing regimens, potentially altering the standard of care in NHL, it will be important to also  assess the safety and efficacy of combining 
DCDS4501A with obinutuzumab-containing regimens. 
The goals of the non-randomized portion of the Phase Ib/II study are to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and pote ntial biologic and clinical activity of DCDS4501A at 
1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL or DLBCL.  The RP2D, the Phase II dose-expansion portion of the study, will further evaluate the safety and tolerability and clinical activity of DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in pati ents with relapsed 
or refractory follicular NHL or DLBCL.

SECTION 3.1.2:  All Patients  on Rituximab-Containing Arms/Cohorts  
All patients on rituximab-containing regimens , regardless of assigned arm/cohort, will 
receive DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab administered by [CONTACT_766203] a 21-day cycle. 
Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the Schedules 
of Assessments outlined in Appendices A-1, A-2,  and 
 A3-4.  Initial response 
assessments in this study will be performed every 3 months from the initiation of therapy 
until study treatment completion or early termination (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1050911] eight 21-day cycles of treatment).  Additional response assessments for patients who proceed to crossover treatment (see Section 3.1.6) will be performed as described in Appendix A-2; response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment (both initially assigned treatment and crossover treatment) for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as 
described in Appendix A

with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL an d DLBCL in two stages:  (1) safety run-in 
and (2) expansion. 
Study treatment will be given in 21-day cycl es for both follicular NHL and DLBCL.  
Patients will be treated for up to a total of  [ADDRESS_1050912] cycle, obinutuzumab 
will be administered by [CONTACT_766299] 1, 8, and 15.  DCDS4501A will be given 
on Day 2 for Cycle 1.  In the absence of any infusion-related adverse events, 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A may be admini stered on the same day (Day 1) in 
subsequent cycles beginning with the second cycle.  If obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A are administered on the same day, the study drugs will be given sequentially.  Obinutuzumab will be administered first , followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A.  In certain 
circumstances
⎯for example, IRRs requiring interruption or slowing of infusion 
rate⎯obinutuzumab may be administered over 2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the 
cycle); in this case, DCDS4501A may be admini stered on Day 2 following completion of 
the obinutuzumab infusion.

11/P GO27834-A2  Summ SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Obinutuzumab-Containing Regimens in Phase Ib:  Safety 
Run-in (Cohort E) 
This portion of the study will consist of a safety run-in that will evaluate the safety of 
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in 6 patients (Cohort E).  
The safety run-in is described in detail in Section 3.4.  In case an amendment to the protocol allows to study higher doses of  DCDS4501A, the safety run-in for the 
1.8 mg/kg may be shor tened to 3 patients.

After the safety run-in has demonstr ated that DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in 
combination with obinutuzumab is safe to administer, patients will be enrolled into two expansion cohorts based on histology of follicular NHL or DLBCL (Cohorts G and H, 
respectively).  Forty patients will be enrolled into each expansion cohort.  An 
additional cohort(s) may be added in the future.

SECTION 3.1.8:  Crossover Tr eatment (Randomized Patients in Arms A and 
B Only)  
Patients will be treated with the crossover treatment until a second disease progression 
event relative to the tumor assessment, documenting progressive disease on the initial study treatment, clinical deterioration, and/or intolerance to the crossover treatment for up to a maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule).  Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules of assessments outlined in Appendices A-2.  Response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment 
for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as described in 
Appendix A-[ADDRESS_1050914] or suspend enrollment into crossover treatment at any time.  Reasons for this may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Patients who are enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C, 
D, E, G, and H ) will not have the option to receive crossover treatment upon 
disease progression (see Section 3.2 for rationale). 
 
SECTION 3.2:  RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
The primary rationale for the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and D)  is 
to assess the therapeutic index (i.e., the balance of efficacy and tolerability of 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL).  An informal comparison between patients with follicular NHL treated at the two doses of the ADC will help determine if tolerability is improved at the lower ADC dose without substantial compromise of efficacy.   
The primary rationale for the non-randomized Phase Ib/II obinutuzumab-containing 
cohorts (Cohorts E
−H) is to assess safety and clinical activity for the combination of 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A in patients wi th relapsed/refractor y NHL (Cohorts E, 
G, and H).   Obinutuzumab (also known as RO5072759, GA101 and 
Gazyva™/Gazyvaro ™), a novel type II and glycoeng ineered anti-CD20 antibody, has 
shown superiority over rituximab in a Phase III trial in first-line CLL (Goede et al. 
2014).  Obinutuzumab is curr ently being compared with rituximab in two large 
Phase III studies in patients with ne wly diagnosed DLBCL (Study BO21005) and 
previously untreated iNHL, including FL (S tudy BO21223).  Assuming these studies 
demonstrate greater clinical benefit with obinutuzumab- vs. rituximab-containing 
regimens, potentially altering th e standard of care in NHL, it will be important to also 
assess the safety and efficacy of combining DCDS4501A with obinutuzumab-
containing regimens. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
13/P GO27834-A2  Summ Study drug dosing will occur on Days 1 or and  2 of each 21-day (or 28-day) cycle to 
allow for recovery from potential bone marrow toxicity. 
SECTION 3.2.1:  Rationale for the PK Sample Schedule  
PK data obtained in this study will be important in informing potential future trials with 
this combination.  Given the likely changing effect of peripheral B-cell counts, tumor burden, and target antigen expression on target -mediated drug CL over multiple doses 
of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A plus rituximab or obinutuzumab  when the two drugs are 
given in combination, the drug levels of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A-related analytes 
and rituximab or obinutuzumab  will be assessed in this combination study.   
In Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, single-agent DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A 
administered by [CONTACT_33433] 21 days we re evaluated at doses ranging from 0.1 to 
3.2 mg/kg for DCDT2980S and 0.1 mg/kg to 2.4 mg/kg for DCDS4501A in patients with NHL.  Intensive PK sampling of all patients in the ongoing Phase I studies will provide sufficient data to allow complete profiling of the distribution and elimination phases for DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A and the investigation of potential correlations between various PK parameters and efficacy and/or toxicity.  Consequently a reduced PK sampling scheme of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A will be used in this Phase
 II study.  
The PK data collected in this Phase  II study will allow further characterization of the 
PK properties of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  In addition, the DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A concentration results from this study will be compared with available data from the single-agent clinical studies to evaluate whether concurrent administration of rituximab affects the exposure of DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A.   
Limited sampling of serum concentrations of obinutuzumab will be assessed and 
compared with historical data to evaluate potential PK interactions with DCDS4501A.  
SECTION 3.3.1:  Safety Outcome Measures  
The safety and tolerability of the combination of DCDT2980S and rituximab and 
DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab will be assessed using the following safety 
outcome measures: 
• Incidence of anti-DCDT2980S or , anti-DCDS4501A, or anti-obinutuzumab  
antibodies 
SECTION 3.3.2:  Pharmacokinetic/ Pharmacodynamic Outcome Measures

of total antibody (the sum of conjugated and unconjugated antibody), including rituximab  
or obinutuzumab , and plasma concentration-time profiles of acMMAE and free MMAE 
following administration of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A, when appropriate, as data allow: 
The following PD outcome measures will be assessed when appropriate, as data allow:

SECTION 3.3.4:  Exploratory Outcome Measures  
The exploratory outcome measures will include, but will not be limited to, the following:  
• Additional assessments related to the understanding of the mechanism of action of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, and rituximab, and obinutuzumab, e.g., assessment of 
circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) to monitor response , mechanisms of resistance to 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A and , rituximab,  and obinutuzumab, and/or NHL 
pathogenesis may be included. 
• Quality of life Treatment and disease symptom  assessments using the M.D.

SECTION 3.4.1:  Safety Run-In Analysis 
As outlined in Figure 3b and Section [IP_ADDRESS], a safety run-in analysis (Cohort E) will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_514866] (IMC) to evaluate the combination of DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg with obinutuzumab.  This analysis will include data from the first [ADDRESS_1050918] cycle.  At the IMC’s discretion, and at any 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
15/P GO27834-A2  Summ point during enrollment of the safety run-in, a decision could be made that more than 
[ADDRESS_1050919] additional doses the safety run-in for 1.8 mg/kg may be shortened to three patients. 
Safety summaries will be assessed at the safety run-in for SAEs; Grade 3-5 treatment-related AEs; all AEs; all Grade 3-5 AEs;  and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or dose modification/interruption. 
• During the 6-patient safety run-in, if any patient experiences a treatment-related 
death, then the obinutuzumab-containing portion of the study will be closed to 
further recruitment. 
• During the 6-patient safety run-in:

in the presence of Grade 3 −4 neutropenia, then the obinutuzumab-containing 
portion of the study will be closed to further recruitment. 
Before the expansion portion of the study can begin (enrollment of Cohorts G 
and H), the following criteria must be met: 
Six patients must have competed enrollment in the safety run-in 
(Cohort E). 
Three patients must have completed at least 4 cycles of treatment. 
 
SECTION 3.4.2:  Intern al Monitoring Committee  
In addition to the ongoing assessment of the incidence and nature of adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities by [CONTACT_82171], the IMC will review the aforementioned data at least twice during the study.   
Throughout the course of the study, the IMC will meet , as needed , at the request of the 
Medical Monitor (e.g., on the basis of unexpected safety signals).  The IMC may make

Febrile neutropenia is commonly associated with myelotoxicity, which is considered a class effect 
of MMAE because it is commonly reported with ADCETRIS®, other similar ADCs, and 
vincristine sulfate. 
Clinical data show that among the most common SAEs reported in both DCS4968g and 
DCT4862g studies were febrile neutropenia and pyrexia. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Immunogenicity 
As expected with any recombinant antibody, DCDT2980S , and DCDS4501A , and 
obinutuzumab may elicit an immune response and patients may develop antibodies 
against DCDT2980S , and DCDS4501A , or obinutuzumab.  Patients will be closely 
monitored for any potential immune response to DCDT2980S , and DCDS4501A, and 
obinutuzumab .  Appropriate screening and confirmatory assays will be employed to 
detect ATAs at multiple timepoints before, during, and after treatment with DCDT2980S,  
or DCDS4501A , and obinutuzumab .  Considering the historically low immunogenicity rate 
of rituximab in NHL patients, ATAs against rituximab will not be monitored in this study. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
17/P GO27834-A2  Summ SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Peripheral Sensory  Neuropathy 
On the basis of clinical data from the ongoing Phase I Studies DCT4862g and 
DCS4968g and data from brentuximab vedotin studies, an anti-CD30-vc-MMAE ADC 
(see Section 3.4.2), peripheral sensory  neuropathy  (sensory and motor)  has been 
identified as a known risk (adverse drug reaction) for both DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A. 
Careful clinical evaluation of patients for neuropathy should be conducted prior to 
initiation of study drug.  Patients should be monitored for signs of peripheral neuropathy 
or worsening neuropathy and appropriate action taken per protocol guidelines.  Study treatment dose and schedule modifications for significant and prolonged neuropathic toxicity and dose-reduction are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A as well as with other ADCs using the same vc-MMAE platform.  Several 
patients given both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A had abnormal fasting blood sugar (FBS)  at screening with elevations of glucose following steroid administration prior to rituximab dose.  
Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs 
and/or initiation or adjustment of anti-hyperglycemic medications.  Emerging data suggest 
that hyperglycemia may occur more commonly in  individuals with abnormal FBS values or 
known diabetes.  This is also reported for ADCETRIS
® (2013 SmPC and 2013 USPI).   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity is a potential risk of the ADCs.  Definitive attribution of hepatotoxicity to 
the ADCs has not been established.  Transient dose related increases in hepatic 
enzyme levels were observed in rats treated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.   
Elevations in transaminase and/or bilirubin levels requiring dose modifications and 
treatment discontinuations  have been reported in the ongoing clinical studies.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Commonly Reported Side Effects  
Other commonly reported side effects of both  DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A in the Phase I clinical 
trials and within this study include fatigue, na usea, decreased appetite, vomiting, hair thinning 
or loss, joint pains, loss of appetite, diarrhea, muscle aches, constipation, increases in blood 
glucose, and headaches. 
SECTION 3.4.6:  Risks Associated with Obinutuzumab Therapy  
No evidence available at the time of the app roval of this protocol indicates that special 
warnings or precautions are appropriate other than those noted in the Obinutuzumab 
Investigator’s Brochure and as described in the following sections. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Infusion-Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity 
Reactions (includ ing Anaphylaxis)  
The commonly experienced IRRs have been characterized by [CONTACT_411], chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, hypotensio n, hypertension, fatigu e, and other symptoms. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
18/P GO27834-A2  Summ Respi[INVESTIGATOR_570590] -related symptoms, such as hypoxia, dyspnea, bronchospasm, 
larynx and throat irritation, and laryngeal edema, have also been reported.  These IRRs 
were mostly mild or moderate (NCI CTCAE v3.0, Grade 1 and 2 events), and < 10% of 
the events were severe (Grade 3 events), occurring predominantly during the first hour of the infusion or shortly after the first infusion had finished.  The events resolved with the slowing or interruption of the infusion and supportive care.  The incidence and severity of IRRs decreased with subsequent infusions.  Extensive tumor burden predominantly localized in the blood circulat ion (e.g., high peripheral lymphocyte count 
in patients with CLL) may be a predisposing factor for the development of IRRs. 
IRRs may be clinically indi stinguishable from IgE-mediat ed allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
TLS has been reported with obinutuzumab administration.  Patients with a high tumor 
burden, including patients with a lymphocyte count ≥ 25  × 109/L, particularly patients 
with B-cell CLL and MCL, are at increased ri sk for TLS and severe IRRs.  All patients 
with peripheral blood lymphocyte counts of ≥ 25  × 109/L or bulky adenopathy must 
receive prophylaxis for TLS prior to the initiation of study treatment.  This includes appropriate hydration, consisting of fluid intake of approx imately 3 L/day, starting 
1
−[ADDRESS_1050925] dose of obinutuzumab, and administration of allopurinol 
(300 mg/day orally) or a suitab le alternative (i.e ., rasburicase) treatment, starting at 
least [ADDRESS_1050926] infusion of obinutuzumab (Cycle 1, Day 1).  All patients should then be carefully monitored during the initial weeks of treatment.  Patients still considered at risk for TLS because of persistently high tumor burden (i.e., peripheral blood lymphocyte counts 
≥ 25  × 109/L) before the second and subsequent 
infusions of obinutuzum ab should receive continuous T LS prophylaxis with allopurinol 
or a suitable alternative (i.e., rasburicase) and adequate hydration until the risk is abated, as determined by [CONTACT_093].  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
19/P GO27834-A2  Summ SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Neutropenia 
Cases of Grade [ADDRESS_1050927] Grade 2.  Use of G-CSF 
has been found to result in a rapid normalization of neutrophils, similar to what has been observed in patients treated with rituximab.  The use of G-CSF is allowed for treatment of neutropenia in this study.   Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is 
recommended according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, namely for patients who are 
≥ 60 years old and/or with co-morbidities (Lyman et al. 2004).   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Thrombocytopenia 
Severe and life-threatening thrombocytopenia, including acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within 24 hours after the infusion), has been observed during treatment with obinutuzumab.  Fatal hemorrhagic events have also been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab.  It seems that the first cycle is the greatest risk of hemorrhage in patients treated with obinutuzumab.  A clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events has not been established.  Patients treated with concomitant medication, which could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia-related events (e.g., platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants), may be at greater risk of bleeding.  Patients should be closely monitored for th rombocytopenia, especially during the first 
cycle; regular laboratory tests should be performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be considered in case of severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia.  Transfusion of blood products (i.e., platelet transfusion) according to institutional practice is at the discretion of the treating physician.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Infection 
On the basis of its anticipated mode of action, resulting in profound B-cell depletion, obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections.  Infections have been reported in patients receiving obinutuzumab.  Therefore, obinutuzumab should not be administered to patients with active severe infections. 
A “black-box” warning for obinutuzumab states that reactivation of hepatitis B as well 
as other serious viral infections (e.g., infections caused by [CONTACT_27912], Varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, JC virus, and HCV) that were new, reactivated, or exacerbated have been reported with the B cell
−depleting antibody rituximab mainly in 
patients who had received the drug in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic SCT.  The risk of such infections with obinutuzumab is unknown.  Particular attention should be given to patients who have previously received significant immunosuppressive treatment, such as high-dose chemotherapy and SCT. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
20/P GO27834-A2  Summ A “black-box” warning for obinutuzumab states that JC viral infection (including 
fatal) that resulted in PML with destructive infection of oligodendrocytes of the CNS white matter) have been reported in patients treated with anti-CD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including rituximab and obinutuzumab. 
The diagnosis of PML should be considered  in any patient presenting with new-onset 
neurologic manifestations.  The sympto ms of PML are unspecific and can vary 
depending on the affected region of the br ain.  Motor involvement with corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_766164], sensory involvement, cerebellar deficits, and visual field defects are 
common.  Some syndromes regarded as cort ical (e.g., aphasia or visual-spatial 
disorientation) can occur. 
Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, 
brain MRI, and lumbar puncture (cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_570591]).  
Therapy with obinutuzumab should be withheld during the investigation of potential 
PML and permanently discontinued in case of confirmed PML.  Discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should also be considered.  The patient should be referred to a neurologist for the diagnosis and management of PML. 
SECTION 3.5:  MINI MIZATION OF BIAS 
For theThis is a  randomized, non-comparative, open-label  portion of the  study ,.  
pPatients werewill be  randomly allocated to two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio through use 
of an Interactive Voice and Web Response System (IXRS).  A dynamic stratified 
randomization scheme waswill be  employed to ensure balance in the stratification factors 
as specified in Section 3.1.  This portion of the study (Arms A and B) is now closed to 
enrollment.  
SECTION 3.6:  ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE  
Approximately 40 study centers in the [LOCATION_002], Canada, and Europe will 
participate in the study to enroll approximately 252120 patients.  Additional patients may 
be enrolled in order to obtain additional safety and/or efficacy data. 
SECTION 4.1.1:  Inclusion Criteria  
Patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible for study entry: 
• For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with female partners 
of childbearing potential, agreement to use one highly effective form of nonhormonal 
contraception or two effective forms of nonhormonal contraception, including at 
least one method with a failure rate of < 1% per year, through the course of 
study treatment and for ≥ [ADDRESS_1050928] dose of 
DCDT2980S or , DCDS4501A or , rituximab, or obinutuzumab (whichever is later) in 
women and at least [ADDRESS_1050929] dose of DCDT2980S  or, DCDS4501A 
or, rituximab, or obinutuzumab  (whichever is later) in men 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
21/P GO27834-A2  Summ Males must agree to abstain from sperm donation for at least [ADDRESS_1050930] dose of DCDT2980S or , DCDS4501A or , rituximab,  or obinutuzumab  
(whichever is later). 
 
SECTION 4.2:  METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT  
As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], only select investigator sites that have agreed to 
participate in the non-randomized (Cohorts C and D)  portion of the study will enroll 
patients into these cohorts.  Cohorts C and D will be opened sequentially following 
completion of the randomized portion of the study for patients with FL. 
For obinutuzumab-containing cohorts (Cohorts E, G, and H), patients with either 
relapsed or refractory follicular  NHL or relapsed or refractory DLBCL will be enrolled.  
After the safety run-in stage for DCDS 4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in  combination with 
obinutuzumab, the patients will be enrolled into the dose-expansion portion with 40 patients in each histology group.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Dosage Modification  
Specific guidelines around dosage modifications for neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy are detailed below in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  Patients who experience other treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity
 or laboratory abnormalities  will be allowed 
to delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab  or obinutuzumab ) for up to 
2 weeks to allow for recovery.  Patients may continue to receive additional infusions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A per their treatment assignment provided that the toxicity has resolved to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of the baseline value, whichever is lower, within the 
2−week delay period.  Upon resolution, the dose for subsequent infusions may be 
reduced to 1.8 mg/kg (in Cohorts C and D) .  If the toxicity that resulted in the dose 
reduction persists or recurs at the reduced dose, then the patient should be discontinued from study treatment.  The decision for dose modification will be made on the basis of the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continued study treatment and in consultation with the Medical Monitor.   
Once dose reductions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A are made for toxicity, dose 
re-escalation will not be allowed.  Patients who are enrolled in the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and D), are dosed at an ADC dose of 1.8 mg/kg, and have progressive disease in the absence of any drug-related toxicity may have their 
ADC dose increased to 2.4 mg/kg if it is felt that there is reasonable justification for ongoing clinical benefit.  The decision to increase the dose must be made in consultation 
with and approval of the Medical Monitor.   Patients in Cohorts E, G, and H 
(obinutuzumab-containing cohorts) will not be eligible for dose escalation.  
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to DCDT2980S or DCDS4501 A, requiring its 
discontinuation, single-agent rituximab may be continued on the basis of the 
investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit and with the approval of the Medical 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
22/P GO27834-A2  Summ Monitor.   Patients enrolled in obinutuzumab-containing cohorts will not continue on 
single-agent obinutuzumab unless approved by [CONTACT_1689].  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Schedule Modification  
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved to Grade ≤ 2 or ≥ 80% of baseline value, 
whichever is lower, may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  Dosing of 
both DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab should be held during 
this period.  If all study drug −related toxicities have resolved sufficiently, the patient may 
resume DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab dosing on the 
regular every-21-day schedule.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Neutropenia  
Because neutropenia is a known risk of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the use of growth factor support (G-CSF) as prophylactic and therapeutic indications is permitted (see Appendi x F) in order to allow continued dosing 
of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A.  Dose modifications for patients who experience treatment-related Grade 3− 4 neutropenia in the context of G-CSF usage are as follows: 
• Patients who experience treatment-related Grade 3− 4 neutropenia will be allowed to 
delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab  or obinutuzumab ) for up 
to two weeks to allow for recovery.  Therapeutic G-CSF is permitted as clinically 
indicated (see Appendix F) and to facilitate neutrophil recovery to allow subsequent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dosing. 
• Subsequent dosing of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A and rituximab/obinutuzumab is 
permitted provided that the neutropenia has resolved to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of the 
baseline value, whichever is lower, within the 2-week period.   
• If prophylactic G-CSF was not administered prior to the cycle in which the 
Grade 3− 4 neutropenia developed, then prophylactic G-CSF may be administered 
prior to subsequent cycles without DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose reduction.  The dose schedule may be changed from 21-day to 28-day cycles to provide sufficient 
time for neutrophil recovery in subsequent cycles.  In the absence of prophylactic 
G-CSF or dose schedule modification, the dose of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A in 
subsequent cycles should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.   For Cohorts E, G, and H, 
patients will be given DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg, and further dose 
reductions cannot be made .   
• For patients enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C 
and D , as well as Cohorts E, G, and H ), dose modifications will not be allowed.  
Administration of therapeutic/prophylactic G-CSF and dose-schedule modifications 
as described above are allowed.  Patients who have persistent or recurrent 
Grade 3− 4 neutropenia as defined above should be discontinued from study 
treatment. 
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Peripheral Sensory /Motor Neuropathy  
Peripheral sensory  neuropathy (sensory or motor) is a known risk of DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  For new or worsening drug-related Grade 2 or 3 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
23/P GO27834-A2  Summ peripheral sensory and/or motor neuropathy, dosing should be held for up to 2 weeks 
until peripheral sensory  neuropathy (sensory or motor)  improves to Grade 1 or baseline 
grade.  Continuation of study treatment following dose delays beyond 2 weeks will 
require consultation with and approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment 
of the benefit-risk analysis of continuing to delay study treatment. 
Following resolution of peripheral sensory  neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) , 
subsequent doses of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.  
DCDS4501A should not be reduced to a dose lower than 1.8 mg/kg.   If worsening 
Grade 2 or 3 peripheral sensory  neuropathy (sensory and/or motor)  recurs following 
dose reduction, study treatment should be discontinued.  For Grade 34 peripheral 
sensory  neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) , study treatment should be discontinued.  
For patients enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and D), 
dose modifications will not be allowed.  Patients who have Grade 2 or 3 peripheral 
sensory  neuropathy  (sensory and/or motor),  as defined above , should be discontinued 
from study treatment.   
SECTION 4.3.3:  Obinutuzumab  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Formulation 
Obinutuzumab (GA101/Gazyva ™/Gazyvaro) is a clear, colorless to slightly brownish 
liquid, provided as a single  1000-mg dose liquid concentr ate with a strength of 
25 mg/mL.  It is supplied in 50 −mL glass vials containing 40 mL of the 25 mg/mL 
liquid concentrate.  In addition to the antibody, the liquid also contains 
histidine/histidine-HCl, trehalose, poloxame r 188, and highly purified water (HPW). 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Dosage, Administration and Storage 
Obinutuzumab will be administered by [CONTACT_766303] (flat) dose of 
1000 mg in combination wi th DCDS4501A, as outlined in Section 3.1.3.  
Obinutuzumab will be administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2
−8 (see Table 2).  No do se modifications of obinutuzumab are allowed. 
All obinutuzumab infusions should be administered after premedication with oral acetaminophen and an antihi stamine (see Section 4.4.1).  The prophylactic use of 
corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent) may also be considered for patients thought to be at high risk for IRRs, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093], and should be administered prior to the obinutuzumab infusion.  On Cycle [ADDRESS_1050931] 
60 minutes prior to the obinutuzumab infusion.  Premedication with prednisone or prednisolone is mandatory in patients who had an IRR and should continue until IRRs no longer occur during antibody infusion.  For the management of IRRs and anaphylaxis, see Table 1 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
24/P GO27834-A2  Summ If it is the strong preference of the investigator or of the site (e.g., for logistical reasons) 
or if the patient is at increased risk for an IRR (high tumor burden, high peripheral lymphocyte count), the administration of obinutuzumab infusion can be split over [ADDRESS_1050932] be administered in a clinical (inpatient or 
outpatient) setting.  Full emergency resuscitation facilities should be immediately available, and patients should be under the close supervision of the investigator at all times.  For the management of IRRs and anaphylaxis, see Table 1 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Obinutuzumab should be administered as a slow IV infusion through a dedicated line.  IV infusion pumps should be used to control the infusion rate of obinutuzumab.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus.  Ad ministration sets with PVC, polyurethane 
(PUR), or PE as a product contact [CONTACT_26778] (PO), polypropylene (PP), PVC, or PE as a product contact [CONTACT_570642].  Do not use an additional in-line filter because of potential adsorption. 
The recommended storage conditions for obinutuzumab drug product are between 2°C 
and 8°C, protected from light.  For clinic al formulation-specific and batch-specific 
instructions and information on in-use stability, see the packaging label.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Dosage Modification 
There will be no obinutuzumab dose modificatio n in this study.  Patients at high risk 
for TLS complications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive obinutuzumab over 2 consecutive days (with DCDS4501A dose potentially delayed to Day 2 or Day 3). 
Any NCI CTCAE (v4.0) toxicity Grade 
≥ 3 in severity that is deemed related to 
obinutuzumab treatment will require in terruption of study treatment (both 
DCDS4501A and obinutuzumab) un til resolution to Grade ≤ 2 or ≥ 80% of baseline, 
whichever is lower.  Resumption of obinutuzumab treatment may be considered in 
patients with resolution of toxicities to Grade ≤ 1 within 2 weeks at the discretion of the 
investigator, after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  Failure of such toxicities to resolve after 2-week delay in study treatment will require permanent discontinuation of obinutuzumab.  Continuation of study treatment following dose delays beyond 2 weeks will require consultation with and approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment of the benefit-risk analysis of continuing to delay study treatment.  
If a patient develops una cceptable toxicity to obinutuzumab requiring its 
discontinuation, single-agent DC DS4501A will not be  permitted.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved (i.e., to Grade ≤ 1 or ≥ 80% of baseline) 
may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  Dosing of both DCDS4501A 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
25/P GO27834-A2  Summ and obinutuzumab should be held during this period.  If all study drug −related 
toxicities have resolved to Grade  ≤ 1 or ≥ 80% of baseline, the patient may resume 
DCDS4501A and obinutuzumab do sing on the regular every −21−day schedule.  In 
addition, a patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_766304] a patient’s dosing regimen from 21-day to 28-day cycles would provide sufficient time for recovery from transient cytopenias without requiring repeated treatment delays. 
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for dosing after the additional [ADDRESS_1050933] 
elapsed may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes (see Section 4.5.6).  Exceptions on the basi s of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed 
following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].  In addition, delay of therapy because of toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation and will be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
Specific guidelines around schedule mod ifications for thrombocytopenia are detailed 
below in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia is a known risk of obinutuzumab (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  If the clinical 
condition of a patient requires the use of concomitant anticoagulants, the patient is at increased risk of bleeding when the platelet count is 
< 20,000/μL.  When possible, 
replace prior therapy with Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) before Cycle 1 Day 1.  Clinical decision making may be adjusted depending on the patient-specific assessment of benefit and risk. 
In the event of severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count 
< 10,000/μL) and/or 
symptomatic bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who are not receiving 
concomitant anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors: 
• Hold obinutuzumab until thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding resolves, but 
do not skip any doses of obinutuzumab for the sake of maintaining the study 
treatment schedule. 
 
In the event of thrombocytopenia with platelet count < 20,000/μL and/or symptomatic 
bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who are receiving concomitant 
anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors: 
• Hold obinutuzumab  until thrombocytopeni a or symptomatic bleeding resolves, but 
do not skip any doses of obinutuzumab for the sake of maintaining the study 
treatment schedule. 
• For patients who are on LMWH or NOACs, when platelet count < 20,000/μL 
develops, reduce the dose of LMWH or NOACs used. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
26/P GO27834-A2  Summ • For patients who are on platelet inhibitors when thrombocytopenia with platelet 
count < 20,000/μL develops, consideration should be given to temp orarily pausing 
the use of platelet inhibitors. 
 
SECTION 4.3.4:  Investigational Medicinal  Product Ac countability 
All investigational medicinal products (IMPs ) required for completion of this study 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_524660] [DCDT2980S], polatuzumab vedotin [DCDS4501A], rituximab, 
and obinutuzumab) will be provided by [CONTACT_76971].  The study site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs to confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be replaced.  
IMPs will be either disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s 
institutional standard operating procedure or returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate documentation.  The site's method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by [CONTACT_1034].  The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before any IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form. 
Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of by

SECTION 4.4.1:  Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs,  medications or  
over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements)  
preparations  used by a patient frombetween the  7 days prior to preceding  the screening 
evaluation and to the end of study visits.  All concomitant medications should be 
reported to the investigator and recorded on the appropriate electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, or other maintenance therapy should continue their use.  Concomitant use of hematopoietic growth factors is allowed in accordance with instructions provided in the package inserts. 
For patients enrolled on obinutuzumab-containing regimens, it is recommended that 
oral prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone be given as premedication within [ADDRESS_1050934] obinutuzumab infusion, additional glucocorticoids are allowed at the investigator’s discretion.  For patients who did not experience infusion-related symptoms with their previous infusion, premedication at subsequent infusions may be omitted at the investigator’s discretion. 
SECTION 4.4.2:  Excluded Therapy  
Patients who require the use of any of these agents will be discontinued from all study treatment.  Patients who are discontinued from study treatment will be followed for safety 
outcomes for 30 days following the patient’s last dose of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A or 
rituximab or obinutuzumab , whichever is later, or until the patient receives another 
anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.

27/P GO27834-A2  Summ SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure while the 
patient is in a sitting or semi-supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], pulse oximetry, pulse rate, and body temperature.  Every effort will be made to ensure that vital signs are obtained from patients in a consistent manner and position.  The timing of vital sign collection on the days of study treatment administration is as follows: 
• For the administration of rituximab  or obinutuzumab, vital signs should be assessed 
prior to the start of the infusion, every 15 ( ±
 5) minutes during the first hour of the 
infusion, as clinically indicated during the remainder of the infusion, and following 
the completion of the infusion.  
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Ph ysical Examination 
Resolution or any change in grade  of peripheral  neuropathy AEs and SAEs (with dates) should 
be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source 
data verification (SDV).  This also applies to AEs for which study drug was discontinued or for 
patients in the follow-up phase after last dose of  study treatment with either ongoing AEs or new 
onset of an AE.  For the AEs referring to the follow-up phase newly initiated, relevant treatments 
need to be documented with treatment dates.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Laboratory Assessments  
Central Laboratory Assessments 
Samples for flow cytometry, PK, bone marrow, and anti-DCDT2980S or , 
anti-DCDS4501A,  or anti-obinutuzumab  antibody assessments will be sent to one or 
several laboratories or to Genentech for analyses (see Section 3.6).  The following 
assessments will be conducted: 
• ATA assays 
ATAs to DCDT2980S or , DCDS4501A,  or obinutuzumab  will be determined at 
Genentech using a validated ELISA (see Section 4.9).  
• PK and PD  assays (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• A plasma sample and blood samples  will be collected from patients for exploratory 
research as indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Electrocardiogram Assessments 
Twelve-lead digital ECG measurements will be obtained in triplicate, with immediately 
consecutive ECGs obtained until three evaluable ECGs are recorded, at the following timepoints: 
• Day 8 ( ±
 1 day) of Cycle 3 time matched (i.e., obtained at the same time of day) with 
post-DCDT2980s/DCDS4501A infusion ECGs for Cycle 3  only for 
rituximab-containing arms/cohorts 
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic  Assessments 
Pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  will be characterized by [CONTACT_766237] (conjugated and unconjugated antibody), acMMAE, and free MMAE 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
28/P GO27834-A2  Summ concentrations using validated methods (see Section 4.9).  Plasma samples may also be 
analyzed for other potential MMAE-containing catabolites, per sponsor’s discretion.  Pharmacokinetics of rituximab will be characterized by [CONTACT_766238] a validated method (see Section 4.9).  Pharmacokinetics of 
obinutuzumab will be characterized by [CONTACT_766305] a validated method  (see Section 4.9).  These assessments will allow for further 
characterization of pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, the assessment 
of the drug interaction potential when they are given in combination with rituximab or 
obinutuzumab , and the investigation of potential correlations between PK parameters 
and safety and/or activity if data allow and at the sponsor’s discretion.  
Pharmacodynamics of obinutuzumab and DCS4501A may be assessed by [CONTACT_766240].  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Imm unogenicity Assessments 
The schedule of sample collection for ATA assessment is outlined in Appendices B-[ADDRESS_1050935] all antibody responses to 
obinutuzumab.  Samples that screen positive will be analyzed in a confirmatory assay (competitive binding with obinutuzumab) to assess the specificity of the positive response.  The relative levels of ATA in confirmed positive samples will be determined in a titering assay.  Positive ATA samples w ill be stored for further characterization of 
ATA responses, if necessary. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Tumo r Response Assessments 
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and re-assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response assessments will be assessed by [CONTACT_1275], on the basis of physical examinations, CT scans, PET scans, and/or MRI 
scans, and bone marrow examinations, using standard response criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007) (see Appendix C -1 and C-2 ). 
a. Radiographic Assessments for Patients on Ri tuximab-Containing 
Arms/Cohorts  
b. Radiographic Assessments for Patients on Obinutuzumab-Containing 
Cohorts 
PET scans should minimally extend from skul l-base to mid-thigh.  Full-body PET scan 
should be performed when clinically appropriate. 
CT scans with oral and IV contrast should include chest, abdomen, and pelvic scans;  
CT scans of the neck should be included if clinically indicated.  CT scans for response assessment may be limited to areas of prior involvement only if required by [CONTACT_766306]:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
29/P GO27834-A2  Summ authorities.  At the investigator’s discretion, CT scans may be repeated at any time if 
progressive disease is suspected. 
In patients for whom contrast is contraindicated ⎯for example, patients with contrast 
allergy or impaired renal CL ⎯CT or combined PET/CT scans without contrast are 
permitted so long as they permit consistent and precise measurement of target lesions 
during the study treatment period.   
PET and CT scans are required for follicular  NHL and DLBCL patients at screening, 
after Cycle 4 of study treatment (i.e., be tween Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1), and 
at EOT.  The EOT response assessment should be performed 6 −[ADDRESS_1050936] response criteria for NHL (see Appendix C-2).   
cd. Schedule of Tumor Response Assessments for Rituximab-Containing 
Arms/Cohorts  
Tumor response assessments will be performed every 3 months ( ± 1 week) from the 
initiation of study treatment until study treatment completion or early termination (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1050937] 
eight 21-day cycles of treatment).  The schedule of tumor assessments isshould be
 
independent of the study treatment dose schedule.  For patients enrolled on 
rituximab-containing arms/cohorts, the schedule of tumor response assessments is 
detailed in Appendix A-1.  As stated above, for all DLBCL patients  enrolled on a 
rituximab-containing arm/cohort , PET scans are required during the screening period 
and at the 6-month tumor assessment timepoint. 
Additional response assessments, after the final dose of study treatment, for patients 
who discontinue from study treatment (either initial or crossover treatment) for reasons 
other than progressive disease, will be performed as described in Appendix A- 34.  
e. Schedule of Tumor Response Assessm ents for Obinutuzumab-Containing 
Cohorts 
All follicular NHL and DLBCL patients enrolled in obinutuzumab-containing cohorts 
are required to have a combined PET and CT scan at screening, after Cycle 4 of treatment, and at EOT.  The schedule for tumor response assessments for patients enrolled on obinutuzumab-containing cohorts is detailed in Appendix A-3. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Exploratory Research 
a. Tumor Tissue Samples 
Required Tumor Tissue Samples  
• Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from cores taken from provided blocks for 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybr idization (ISH) assessments , including

response to chemotherapy including quantitation of Bcl-2 protein and genetic 
alterations of bcl-2 including gene rearrangements, amplifications, and t(14;18) translocations. Additional IHC markers may include those related to the tumor 
microenvironment. 
b. Blood and Plasma Samples 
Blood samples will be taken aligned with PK sampling to assess the pharmacodynamics 
response by [CONTACT_766244].  
The plasma and blood samples may be used for the assessment of specific tumor 
biologic markers, including proteins, circulating DNA, and microRNAs.  The information obtained from these samples will enable a better understanding of the biology of NHL and disease prognosis, identify potential predictors of response to treatment with 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, and/or 
rituximab, and/or obinutuzumab , improve diagnostic 
assessments, and identify and characterize mechanisms of resistance to DCDT2980S or 
DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab activity.

32/P GO27834-A2  Summ Following discontinuation of study treatment,  patients will be followed for survival 
approximately every 6 months until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or 
study termination.  
SECTION 4.8:  POST-TRIAL ACCESS 
Genentech does not have any plans to provide DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab, obinutuzumab , or other study interventions to patients after the conclusion of the study 
or if the study is terminated or for patients who withdraw early from the study or complete their study treatment.  Genentech will evaluate the appropriateness of 
continuing to provide DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, or 
rituximab, or obinutuzumab  to study 
patients after evaluating the safety and activity data from the study.   
SECTION 4.9.5:  Obinutuzumab ELISA  
Obinutuzumab will be measured in serum samples using a validated ELISA.    
SECTION 4.9.6:  Anti-Therapeutic Antibody  
ATAs against obinutuzumab in serum samples will be measured using a validated 
bridging antibody ELISA. 
SECTION 4.9.7:  Biomarker Assays  
Tumor tissue assessment of biomarkers will be assayed using IHC, ISH, qPCR gene 
expression profiling using microarray and  mutation detection assays.  and flow 
cytometry.  Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) in pl asma samples will be assessed using 
a next generation sequencing approach (CAP P-Seq) to detect and quantitate lymphoma 
specific markers (Newman et al. 2014).  
SECTION 4.10:  STATISTICAL METHODS 
The final analysis will be based on patient data collected through patient discontinuation  
until all patients discontinue  or from the  study discontinuation  or the study is 
terminated by [CONTACT_1034] , whichever occurs first.  The analyses will be based on the 
safety evaluable population, defined as patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.  All summaries will be presented according to the disease-specific cohort, treatment group, and assigned dose level. 
SECTION 4.10.1:  Analysis of  the Conduct of the Study  
Study drug administration data will be listed by [CONTACT_90050]-specific cohorts described in Sections 3.1.[ADDRESS_1050945] 
deviations will be used to summarize the total doses of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A and
, 
rituximab, and obinutuzumab received.  All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_6490], assigned dose level, and disease-specific cohort. 
SECTION 4.10.2:  Safety Analysis  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory 
test results, changes in physical findings on physical examinations, and changes in vital 
signs.  All patients who receive any amount of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A or , rituximab, 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
33/P GO27834-A2  Summ or obinutuzumab  will be included in the safety analysis and will be assigned to the 
treatment group on the basis of the study treatment received.  Patients who have dose 
level changes from the initial assigned dose level will be summarized by [CONTACT_766204]2980S or DCDS4501A. 
SECTION 4.10.3:  Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Individual and mean serum concentrations of total DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A antibody 
(conjugated and unconjugated antibody) and rituximab  or obinutuzumab  and plasma 
concentrations of acMMAE and free MMAE versus time data will be tabulated and 
plotted by [CONTACT_766205] (relapsed or refractory follicular NHL or DLBCL).  The 
pharmacokinetics of the above analytes will be summarized by [CONTACT_570674] (e.g., AUC, C
max, CL, V ss, and t 1/2).  Estimates for these 
parameters will be tabulated and summarized (mean, standard deviation, and range).  Non-compartmental, compartmental, and/or population methods will be used, as data allow.  
SECTION 4.10.4:  Activity Analyses  
ORR from the initial study treatment will be calculated on the basis of data from patients who received study treatment and had at least one post
baseline response assessment .  
Objective response is defined as CR or PR as determined by [CONTACT_093], on the basis of physical examinations, radiographic scans, and bone marrow examinations, using modified response criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007; see Appendix C) and confirmed by [CONTACT_294862] ≥
 4 weeks after initial documentation.  Any patient with 
insufficient data to determine response will be classified as a non-responder. 
For patients with DLBCL, primary assessment of tumor response will be based on 
diagnostic imaging scans ⎯for example, CT and/or MRI scans and PET scans.  For 
patients with FL  enrolled on rituximab-containing arms/cohorts , primary assessment of 
response will be based on CT scans only; the assessment of response in FL based on PET scans will be performed for exploratory purposes only. 
For patients with DLBCL or FL on ob inutuzumab-containing cohorts, primary 
assessment of tumor response will be based on PET/CT scans.  Given the new Lugano 
Classification, 2014, criteria  which recommend that comp lete response (PET-CR) be 
determined by [CONTACT_10052]-CT scan, patients in Cohorts E, G, and H will be evaluated with a PET-CT scan at screening, between Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1 , and at 6-8 weeks 
after completing treatment.  The efficacy analysis for these cohorts will, therefore, be different from the analysis for Arms A- B and Cohorts C-D. (Cheson, et al 2014) 
(see Appendix C-2).  
Among patients with an objective response, duration of response will be defined as the 
time from the initial documentation of a CR or PR to the time of disease progression or 
death.  If a patient does not experience death or disease progression before the end of 
the study, duration of response will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
34/P GO27834-A2  Summ For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), PFS is defined as the time from 
the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  If a patient has not experienced progressive disease or death, 
PFS will be censored at the day 
date of the last tumor assessment.  Patients with no 
post-baseline tumor assessment will be censored on the date of randomization.  For the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and
 Dthrough H ), PFS is defined as the 
time from the date of study enrollment to the date of disease progression or death from 
any cause, whichever occurs first. 
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), OS is defined as the time from 
the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.  For the non-randomized 
portion of the study (Cohorts C and Dthrough H ), OS is defined as the time from the 
date of study enrollment to date of death from any cause. 
SECTION 4.10.7:  Determination of Sample Size  
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), a target of 120 patients will be 
enrolled in two separate cohorts of patients (40 in the follicular NHL cohort and 80 in the 
DLBCL cohort).  Genentech has  judged this The randomized portion of this study is 
non-comparative in nature.  No formal hypothesis testing is planned to compare the 
treatment arms.  Moreover, there is insuffic ient power to detect minimum clinically 
meaningful differences between the two treatment arms.  Genentech has judged the proposed  sample size to provide sufficient precision in estimating the anti-tumor activity of 
DCDT2980S combined with rituximab or DCDS4501A combined with rituximab as measured by [CONTACT_33966].  For example, with the assumption of an observed response rate of 40%, a 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be approximately 22% −58% (i.e., 40% ±  18%) for the follicular NHL cohort and approximately 
27%−53% (i.e., 40% ±  13%) for the DLBCL cohort.   With 40 patients, there is an 87% 
chance of observing at least one adverse event with a true incidence of 5%.  
This is a non
comparative hypothesis generating study.  There is no formal hypothesis 
testing planned to compare the treatment arms .  Specifically, f or the randomized portion 
of the study,  there is insufficient power to detect minimum clinically meaningful differences 
between the two treatment arms. For the non-randomized portions of the study (Cohorts C 
and D), approximately 20 patients will be enrolled into each arm, for a total of 40 patients.   With 20 patients under an observed response rate of 40%, the exact Clopper-Pearson 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be 22%
−61%.  
With respect to the assessment of safety based upon a sample size of [ADDRESS_1050946] one adverse event with a true incidence of 10% is 88%. 
For the obinutuzumab safety run-in cohort (Cohort E), 6 patients will be enrolled.  For 
the obinutuzumab expansion cohorts (Cohorts G and H), 40 patients with follicular NHL and the other with 20
−40 patients with DLBCL, will be enrolled at the RP2D to further 
evaluate safety and efficacy of the combination.  Table 3 provides asymptotic 90% confidence intervals for the true probability of response for a range of observed p roportions based upon a 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
35/P GO27834-A2  Summ sample of 40 patients.  A sample size of 40 patients is d eemed sufficient to provide adequate 
precision on the point estimate and for the lower end of the 90% CI to rule out a clinically 
uninteresting rate of 45% assuming observed resp onse rates of approximately 60% or higher (~24 
responders observed among 40 patients). 
Therefore, up to 252 patients may be enrolled in this study.

The secondary activity objective of the study is the following: 
• To compare the anti-tumor activity of the combination of DCT2980S and rituximab and 
DCDS4501A and rituximab  or obinutuzumab  
 
Pharmacokinetic Objectives The pharmacokinetic (PK) objectives of this study are the following: 
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and rituximab in patients with 
relapsed or refractory NHL when the two drugs are given in combination 
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics of DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab in 
patients with relapsed or refractory NHL wh en the two drugs are given in combination 
 
Patient- Reported Outcome Objectives 
The objective of this study related to assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) is the 
following: 
• To assess patient -reported tolerability to study treatment and the impact of study treatment 
on patient functioning, on the basis of PRO 
 
Biomarker Objectives  
The objectives of this study related to asse ssment of biologic markers are the following: 
• To make a preliminary assessment of biologic markers that might act as predictors of 
DCDT2980S  + rituximab combination anti-tumor activity and allow assessment of response 
in different prognostic subgroups of DLBCL and follicular NHL 
• To make a preliminary assessment of biologic markers that might act as predictors of 
DCDS4501A  + rituximab or obinutuzumab combination anti-tumor activity and allow 
assessment of response in different progno stic subgroups of DLBCL and follicular NHL 
 
Study Design  
Description of Study This is a Phase Ib/ II, multicenter, open-label study.  Up to approximately 252  patients with 
relapsed or refractory FL and  DLBCL will be enrolled at approximately 30 −40 investigative sites 
worldwide.  Additional patients may be enrolled in order to obtain additional safety and/or 
efficacy data. Arms A and B and Cohort C are no longer enrolling patients . 
For Obinutuzumab Cohorts:
 
Only investigational sites in the United Stat es will enroll patients into Cohort E.  
Investigational sites in the Un ited States and Canada will participate in Cohorts G and H).  
The study will be composed of a randomiz ed portion and a non-randomized portion, as 
described in the protocol. 
Rituximab-Containing Regimens with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A  
Randomized Portion of the Study (Arms A and B) 
Following determination of eligibility, patients within each disease group will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments: 
• Arm A:  Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S (2.4 mg/kg) every 21 days; 
• Arm B:  Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A (2.4 mg/kg) every [ADDRESS_1050964] day of treatment constitutes Day 1 of each cycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766166] 21 days in duration. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
51/P GO27834-A2 A dynamic hierarchical randomization scheme will be employed with respect to the following 
stratification factors: 
• For patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) (see the protocol for definitions) 
Rituximab refractory disease (no response or disease relapse < [ADDRESS_1050965] 
rituximab treatment) versus rituximab relapsed disease (disease relapse after response ≥
  [ADDRESS_1050966] rituximab treatment) 
• For patients with DLBCL (see the protocol for definitions) 
Second-line versus third-line (or beyond) therapy 
For second-line patients, disease relapse or no objective response (complete response 
[CR], unconfirmed CR [CRu], or partial respon se [PR]) <12 months from the start of 
initial therapy versus disease relapse, after initial objective response (CR, unconfirmed response [CRu] or PR), ≥ [ADDRESS_1050967]-line patients, failure to achieve a CR or progression < [ADDRESS_1050968] recent therapy versus CR or progression ≥ [ADDRESS_1050969] recent 
therapy 
No formal testing comparing the two treatment ar ms in the randomized portion of the study is 
planned. 
Non-Randomized Portion of the Study with Rituximab  (Cohorts C and D) 
Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the non-randomized portion of 
the study will enroll patients into these cohorts. 
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled in Cohorts C and D to receive 
rituximab (375 mg/m2) combined with DCDT2980S or DCDS450 1A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg.  The 
first day of treatment constitutes Day 1 of each cycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766116] 21 days in duration. The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s discre tion and only after the 
enrollment of patients with FL into the randomized portion of the study is completed.  Patients 
will not be randomized to receive one treatment or  the other.  It is anticipated that Cohort C 
and D will be opened sequentially.   
All Patients  on Rituximab-Containing Arms/Cohorts
 
All patients on rituximab-containing regimens, regardless of assigned arm/cohort, will receive 
DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion on a 
21-day cycle.  For the first two cycles, rituxi mab will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 1 
and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A will be administered by  [CONTACT_95077] 2.  In the absence 
of any infusion-related adverse events, ri tuximab and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be 
administered on the same day (Day 1) in subseque nt cycles beginning with the third cycle.  In 
this instance, rituximab will be administered fi rst, followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S or DCDS4501A.  In 
certain circumstances ⎯for example, infusion-related reacti ons (IRRs) requiring interruption or 
slowing of infusion rate ⎯rituximab may be administered over 2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of 
the cycle); in this case, DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be administered on Day 2 following completion of the rituximab infusion or on Day 3 of the cycle. 
Patients may receive treatments for up to 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule) if not 
discontinued because of significant toxicity, di sease progression, or withdrawal from study. 
Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the Schedules of Assessments 
outlined in the protocol.  Initial response asse ssments in this study will be performed every 
3 months from the initiation of therapy until study treatment completion or early termination 
(e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1050970] 
eight 21-day cycles of treatment).  Additional response assessments for patients who proceed 
to crossover treatment will be performed as described in the protocol; respon se assessments 
for patients who discontinue study treatment (bot h initially assigned treatment and crossover 
treatment) for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as described in the 
protocol. 
Responses to study treatment w ill be based on investigator assessments.  In addition, tumor 
assessment data will be transmitted to an Independen t Review Facility (IRF) for collection and 
possible independent review.  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
52/P GO27834-A2 Obinutuzumab-Containing Regimens with DCDS4501A (Cohorts E,  G, and H)  
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg will be given in combin ation with obinutuzumab to patients with 
relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and DLBC L in two stages: (1) safety run-in and (2) 
expansion . 
Study treatment will be given in 21-day cycles for both follicular NHL and DLBCL.  Patients 
will be treated for up to a to tal of [ADDRESS_1050971] cycle, obinutuzumab will be 
administered by [CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, and 15.  DCDS4501A will be given on Day 2 for 
Cycle 1.  In the absence of any infusion-related adverse events, obinutuzumab and 
DCDS4501A may be administered on the same da y (Day 1) in subsequent cycles beginning 
with the second cycle.  If obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A are administered on the same day, 
the study drugs will be given sequentially.  Obinutuzumab will be administered first, followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A.  In certain circumstances
⎯for example, IRRs requiring 
interruption or slowing of infusion rate ⎯obinutuzumab may be administered over 2 days 
(e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the cycle); in this  case, DCDS4501A may be administered on Day 2 
following completion of the obinutuzumab infusion. 
Obinutuzumab-Containing Regimen in Phase Ib: Safety Run-In (Cohort E) 
This portion of the study will consist of a safe ty run-in that will evaluate the safety of 
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with ob inutuzumab in 6 patients (Cohort E).  The 
safety run-in is described in detail in the protocol.  In case an amendment to the protocol 
allows to study higher doses of DCDS4501A, the safety run-in for the 1.8 mg/kg may be shortened to 3 patients. 
Obinutuzumab-Containing Regimens in Phase II:  Expansion Stage (Cohorts G and H ) 
After the safety run-in has demonstrated that  DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with 
obinutuzumab is safe to administer, patients will be enrolled into two expansion cohorts based 
on histology of follicular NHL or DLBCL (Cohor ts G and H respectively).  Forty patients will 
be enrolled into each expansion cohort.  A n additional coho rt(s) may be added in the future.

Crossover Treatment (Randomized Patients in Arms A and B  Only) 
Patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B who dev elop progressive disease may be eligible to 
receive crossover treatment consisting of ri tuximab and the other antibody-drug conjugate 
(ADC) or the other ADC alone ⎯for example, Arm B treatment for patients who have disease 
progression while receiving Ar m A treatment, and vice versa ⎯provided the following conditions 
are met: 
• Patients must not have experienced a to xicity requiring the discontinuation of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment OR experienced  toxicity during the last dose of study 
treatment that would preclude treatment with the crossover regimen. 
Patients who had modifications to dosing and/ or schedule on the initial study treatment 
will be permitted to receive cr ossover treatment in the absence of toxicities on the 
modified dose and/or schedule.  The dose and schedule of crossover treatment will be 
determined by [CONTACT_33495]. 
Patients who had rituximab discontinued and continued on single-agent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment may rece ive crossover treatment of single-agent 
DCDS4501A/ DCDT2980S. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
54/P GO27834-A2 • Patients must have radiographically documented disease progression. 
• Patients must meet all inclusion and exclusio n criteria described in the Inclusion Criteria 
and Exclusion Criteria sections below, except fo r those related to prior rituximab treatment. 
• Acceptable toxicity:  All study drug–related adv erse events from the initial study treatment 
must have decreased to Grade [ADDRESS_1050975] day of treatment 
on the crossover regimen.  Exceptions may be allowed after a careful assessment and 
discussion of the benefit-risk balance with the pat ient by [CONTACT_766276]. 
• Administration of crossover treatment must  be in the best interests of the patient as 
determined after a careful assessment and discussion of benefit-risk balance with the patient by [CONTACT_766277]. 
• A tumor biopsy (described in the protocol) will be required for pat ients with safely accessible 
site of disease, defined as requiring only loca l anesthesia and, in general, excluding the 
brain, lungs or any internal organs that may subject patients to significant risk.  
Patients for whom a safely ac cessible site of disease is not present may still receive 
crossover treatment without undergoing a biopsy.  Eligibility to receive crossover 
treatment should be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_1689]. 
A tumor biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease is optional for patients who are 
not eligible for study cross over.  
 Patients who are determined to be eligible for study cross over will be treated as follows: 
• Assessments obtained at the initial study treatment discontinuation visit (described in the 
protocol) may be used as screening assessm ents for crossover treatment.  The following 
re-screening assessments must  be repeated/obtained within 1 week prior to starting 
treatment on the crossover regimen, in order to  re-establish baseline pretreatment clinical 
and disease status:  targeted physical exam, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, and hematology and serum chemistry laboratory tests. 
Re-screening tests for hepatitis B and C do not need to be performed unless there is 
clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_136701] B and/or C positivity. 
A radiographic tumor assessment must also be performed, unless already done to 
document disease progression, within 6 we eks prior to starting crossover treatment. 
• Crossover treatment will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1050976] dose of the prior study 
treatment. 
 
Patients will be treated with the crossover treatment until a second disease progression event relative to the tumor assessment, documenting progressive disease on the initial study 
treatment, clinical deterioration, and/or intole rance to the crossover treatment for up to a 
maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule).  Patients will be evaluated for 
safety and efficacy according to the schedules of assessments outlined in the protocol.  
Response assessments for patients who discontin ue study treatment for reasons other than 
disease progression will be performed as described in the protocol.  
Clinical data and exploratory data derived from  tumor biopsies obtained prior to crossover 
treatment will be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Ge nentech has the right to  restrict or suspend 
enrollment into crossover treatment at any time .  Reasons for this may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
• The incidence or severity of adverse events during crossover treatment indicates a potential 
safety hazard to patients. 
• Patient enrollment into crossove r treatment is unsatisfactory. 
• Data recording is inac curate or incomplete.  
• Patients who are enrolled into the non-randomiz ed portion of the study (Cohorts C, D, E , 
G, and H ) will not have the option to receive cros sover treatment upon disease progression.

[CONTACT_766205] (relapsed or refractory follicular NHL or DLBCL).  The pharmacokinetics 
of the above analytes will be summarized by [CONTACT_570674] 
(e.g., AUC, C max, CL, V ss, and t 1/2).  Estimates for these parameters will be tabulated and 
summarized (mean, standard deviation, and ra nge).  Non-compartmental, compartmental, 
and/or population methods will be used, as data allow.  
Exposure-response (safety and efficacy) analysis may be conducted with use of PK data and 
available drug effect (e.g., imaging, measures of tumor burden) and toxi city (e.g., clinical 
pathology) data, at the sponsor’s discretion. 
In addition, population PK methods may be employ ed to manage sparse data and to investigate 
the effects of certain covariates on the p harmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, as 
data allow, and at the sponsor’s discretion. 
Activity Analyses 
Best overall response, duration of respon se, and PFS will be listed for all patients. 
Overall response rate (ORR) from the initial st udy treatment will be calculated on the basis of 
data from patients who received st udy treatment.  Objective response is defined as CR or PR 
as determined by [CONTACT_093], on the basis of physical examinations, radiographic scans, 
and bone marrow examinations, using modified re sponse criteria for NHL and confirmed by 
[CONTACT_294862] ≥ 4 weeks after initial documentation.  Any patient with insufficient data to 
determine response will be classified as a non-responder. 
For patients with DLBCL, prim ary assessment of tumor resp onse will be based on diagnostic 
imaging scans ⎯for example, CT and/or MRI scans and positron emission tomography  (PET) 
scans.  For patients with FL  enrolled on rituximab-containing arms/cohorts , primary 
assessment of respon se will be based on CT scans only; t he assessment of response in FL 
based on PET scans will be performed for exploratory purposes only. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
60/P GO27834-A2 For patients with DLBCL or FL on obinutuzumab-containing cohorts, primary assessment of 
tumor response will be based on PET/CT scans.   Given the new Lugano Classification, 2014, 
criteria which recommend that complete response (PET-CR) be determined by [CONTACT_10052]-CT scan, patients in Cohorts E, G, and H will be evaluated with a PET-CT scan at screening, between 
Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1 , and at 6-8 weeks after completing treatment.  The efficacy 
analysis for these cohorts will, therefore, be different from the analysis for Arms A-B and Cohorts C-D. (Cheson, et al 2014) (see Appendix C-2)  
Among patients with an objective response, duration of response will be defined as the time 
from the initial documentation of a CR or PR to the time of disease progression or death.  If a 
patient does not experience death or disease progression before the end of the study, duration of response will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
For the randomized portion of t he study (Arms A and B), PFS is defined as the time from the 
date of randomization to the date of disease pr ogression or death from any cause, whichever 
occurs first.  If a patient has not experienced progressive disease or death, PFS will be 
censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.  Pa tients with no post-baseline tumor 
assessment will be censored on the date of randomi zation.  For the non-randomized portion of 
the study (Cohorts C through H ), PFS is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment 
to the date of disease progression or death  from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
For the randomized portion of t he study (Arms A and B), OS is defined as the time from the date 
of randomization to the date of death from any cause.  For the non-randomized portion of the 
study (Cohorts C through H ), OS is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to 
date of death from any cause. 
Exploratory Analyses 
Assay results of possible predictive markers w ill be listed by [CONTACT_766281]. 
Summary statistics of the MDASI items, scale s, and their changes from baseline will be 
calculated at each assessment timepoint.  The mean, standard error, and median of the 
absolute scores and the mean changes from ba seline (and 95% CI) within and between study 
arms will be reported for the MDASI scales and single items, as well as the weekly averages of 
the worst symptom rating.  For change scores in the MDASI from baseline, patients without 
baseline scores will not be included in the analyse s.  Line charts depi[INVESTIGATOR_766118].   
Frequencies and percentages of missing data fo r the PRO endpoints will be reported.  Dropouts 
(defined as patients withdrawing from treatm ent for reasons other than documented disease 
progression or death) will be summarized. Repeated measures mixed-effects models will explore MDASI subs cale scores with a baseline 
score and appropriate covariates added, as appropriate. 
Handling of Missing Data
 
For the endpoint of objective response, patient s without a post-baseline tumor assessment will 
be considered non-responders in the all-treated population analysis.  
For duration of response and PFS, data from pat ients who are lost to follow-up will be included 
in the analysis as censored observations on t he last date that the patient is known to be 
progression free, defined as the date of the last  tumor assessment, or, if no tumor assessments 
were performed, as the date of last study treatment plus 1 day. 
Compliance to PRO data collection will be re ported with summary statistics, including 
frequencies of reasons for non-compliance such as patient refusal to complete PRO data 
collection.   
Determination of Sample Size 
For the randomized portion of t he study (Arms A and B), a target of 120 patients will be enrolled 
in two separate cohorts of patient s (40 in the follicular NHL cohort  and 80 in the DLBCL cohort).  
The randomized portion of this study is non-comparative in nature.  No formal hypothesis 
testing is planned to compare the treatment ar ms.  Moreover, there is insufficient power to 
detect minimum clinically meaningful differences between the two treatment arms.  
Genentech has judged the proposed  sample size to provide sufficient precision in estimating the 
anti-tumor activity of DCDT2980S combined wi th rituximab or DCDS4501A combined with 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
61/P GO27834-A2 rituximab as measured by [CONTACT_33966].  For example, with the assumption of an 
observed response rate of 40%, a 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be 
approximately 22%− 58% (i.e., 40% ± 18%) for the follicular NHL cohort and approximately 
27%−53% (i.e., 40% ± 13%) for the DLBCL cohort.   With 40 patients, there is an 87% chance 
of observing at least one adverse event with a true incidence of 5%.  
For the non-randomized portions of the study (Cohorts C and D), approximately 20 patients 
will be enrolled into each arm, for a total of 40 patients.   With 20 pati ents under an observed 
response rate of 40%, the exact Clopper-Pearson 90% confidence interval for the response rate 
would be 22% −61%.  With respect to the assessment of safety based upon a sample size of 
[ADDRESS_1050985] one adverse event with a true incidence of 10% is 
88%. 
For the obinutuzumab safety run-in cohort (Coh ort E), 6 patients will be enrolled.  For the 
obinutuzumab expansion cohorts (Cohorts G and H), 40 patients with follicular NHL and 
40 patients with DLBCL wi ll be enrolled at the RP2D to further evaluate safety and efficacy 
of the combination.  Table 3 in the protocol provides asymptotic 90% confidence intervals for the true 
probability of response for a range of observed pr oportions based upon a sample of 40 patients.  A sample 
size of 40 patients is deemed su fficient to provide adequate precision on the point estimate and for the 
lower end of the 90% CI to rule out a clinically uninteresting rate of 45% assuming observed response 
rates of approximately 60% or higher (~24 responders observed among 40 patients). 
Therefore, up to 252 patients may be enrolled in this study.

66/P GO27834-A2 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON DISEASE  
B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders are a heterogeneous group of malignancies,  ranging 
from slow-growing indolent and incurable diseases with a median survival of 8 −10 years 
(such as follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL ]) to more aggressive intermediate- to 
high-grade lymphomas (such as diffuse large-cell lymphoma), which can have a median 
survival of 6 months if left untreated or l ong-term remission in more than 50% of patients 
with appropriate treatment.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL accounting for approximately 30% −40% of all new patients, whereas 
follicular lymphoma (FL) accounts for approximately 20% −25% of new lymphomas.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_766148]20-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) rituximab (Rituxan
®, MabThera®) in 
combination with chemotherapy, indolent B-cell malignancies remain incurable, as do approximately half of aggressive NHL patients.  Thus, there is still a need for treatments that can be combined with chemoimmunotherapy and can significantly extend disease-free and overall survival (OS) in thes e patients, with at least acceptable, if not 
superior, safety profiles. 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON THE MOLECULES 
1.2.1 DCDT2980S  
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Preclinical Data 
CD22 is a cell-surface antigen whose expression is restricted to all mature B cells except 
plasma cells.  It is expressed in a majority of the B cell −derived malignancies, including 
nearly all NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukem ia (CLL) samples tested (see Figure 1).  
Antibodies bound to CD22 are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570580], making CD22 ideally suited for targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents (Shan and Press 1995).   
DCDT2980S is an antibody −drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of a potent anti-mitotic 
agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) c onjugated to a humanized immunoglobulin-G1 
(IgG1) anti-CD22 MAb, MCDT2219A, via a protease-labile linker, 
maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-am inobenzoyloxycarbonyl (MC-VC-PABC).  
MMAE has a mode of action similar to vincristine, which is a component of standard chemotherapy used in lymphoma therapy.  This therapeutic approach takes advantage 
of the specific targeting capability of the antibody and the cytotoxic activity of MMAE.  Following internalization, the MMAE is deconjugated from DCDT2980S by [CONTACT_570622], binds to tubulin, and disrupts the microtubule network, resulting in inhibition of cell division and cell growth and induction of apoptosis (Doronina et al. 2003).

CLL  = chronic lymphocytic leukemia; DLBCL  = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; FL  = follicular 
lymphoma; MCL  = mantle cell lymphoma; MFI  = mean fluorescence intensity; MZL  =  marginal 
zone lymphoma. 
CD22 expression levels (MFI) on B-cell tumor cells were assessed by [CONTACT_766208] B-cell lymphomas:  CLL (n  = 49), DLBCL (n  = 59), FL (n  = 58), 
MCL (n  = 20), and MZL (n  = 60).  
 
Comprehensive pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and 
toxicology evaluations were conducted to support the use of DCDT2980S in clinical trials.  DCDT2980S binds human CD22 with a high affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant [K
d] = 1.7  ± 0.2 nM) and showed similar binding a ffinity to cynomolgus monkey 
CD22.  No binding activity was observed with mouse and rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).   
The unconjugated antibody MCDT2219A did not appear to induce antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complem ent-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in vitro.  
In contrast, DCDT2980S displayed potent and selective inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro (50% of the maximal inhibitory concentration [IC
50] = 0.33 nM) by [CONTACT_766209].  Efficacy studies conducted in murine xenograft models of human lymphoma 
(CD22-positive WSU-DLCL2 and BJAB cell lines) showed that a single dose of DCDT2980S resulted in regression of tumor growth at doses ranging from 1 to 4 mg/kg.  PD studies with DCDT2980S showed that a single dose of 1 −6 mg/kg resulted in partial 
depletion of peripheral blood B cells in cynomolgus monkeys with a corresponding depletion in germinal center B cells in lymphoid tissue. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
68/P GO27834-A2 The PK profiles of DCDT2980S were observed to be linear in rodents and moderately 
non-linear in cynomolgus monkeys over the tested dose range.  The non-linear 
clearance (CL) observed in cynomolgus monk eys with DCDT2980S is likely due to the 
contribution of B cell-mediated CL to the total CL.  The free MMAE concentrations in cynomolgus monkeys following DCDT2980S administration were generally 10,[ADDRESS_1050989] relevant nonclinical species for the 
toxicology and PK/PD studies of DCDT2980S, given the comparable sequence homology of human and cynomolgus monkey CD22, similar binding affinity of DCDT2980S to human and cynomolgus monk ey CD22, and comparable tissue 
cross-reactivity in both human and cynomol gus monkey tissues.  DCDT2980S was well 
tolerated at doses of up to 3 mg/kg (highest non-severely toxic dose [HNSTD]) in monkeys and up to or greater than 10 mg/kg in rats (severely toxic dose to 10% [STD
10] 
of rats ≥  10 mg/kg).  Reversible bone marrow toxicity and associated hematopoietic 
changes were observed in both rats and m onkeys treated with DCDT2980S or MMAE, 
suggesting that the toxicity of DCDT2980S is related to MMAE.  Additional effects on liver and lung in rats were minimal in severity and reversible and did not occur in cynomolgus monkeys, which may be due to differ ences in species sensitivity, exposure, 
and/or pharmacokinetics.   
Complete details of preclinical studies of DCDT2980S can be found in the DCDT2980S 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] DCDT2980S Clinical Data 
a. Patient Enrollment 
Both DCDT2980S monotherapy and combination therapy with rituximab have been 
studied in a Phase I study (Study DCT4862g) of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies expected to express CD22, including indolent NHL, DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and CLL. 
All data presented herein is based on a data entry cutoff of 22 February 2013, with 
clinical data available from 65 patients with NHL (excluding patients with CLL) enrolled in dose-escalation and expansion cohorts.  These include 49 patients who were treated with single-agent DCDT2980S at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg administered intravenously every 21 days and 16 patients who were enrolled into two Phase Ib cohorts with DCDT2980S administered at doses of 1.8 mg/kg (5 patients) and 2.4 mg/kg (11 patients) in combination with 375 mg/m
2 rituximab. 
Enrollment into CLL dose escalation cohorts was closed on 31 May 2013.  Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure for details regarding clinical data in CLL patients. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
69/P GO27834-A2 b. Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S have bee n characterized in the Phase I 
Study DCT4862g.  DCDT2980S was administered to patients with NHL at dose levels 
ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w).  Three analytes were quantified:  antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), total antibody, and free MMAE.  
Preliminary PK analysis based on available data as of 22 June 2012 is summarized 
below.   
The mean value of CL estimates of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level for 
doses of ≥
 1.0 mg/kg ranged from 17.6 to 21.3 mL/day/kg and from 10.5 to 
16.2 mL/day/kg, respectively.  Similar CL estimates for doses ≥ 1.0 mg/kg suggested 
dose-proportional increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposure.  CL estimates appeared to be slightly higher at doses <
 1.0 mg/kg (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg), although 
data from these dose levels are limited.  The CL of acMMAE was faster than that of total antibody at each dose level.   
In patients with NHL, the mean value of the steady-state volume of distribution (V
ss) of 
acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level ranged from 69.2 to 130 mL/kg and from 
97.4 to 154 mL/kg, respectively, across the dose levels tested, approximating human serum volume.  V
ss values did not appear to change substantially with dose.  The half-life 
for acMMAE and total antibody ranged from 2. 9 to 7.0 days and from 4.4 to 13 days, 
respectively.   
For acMMAE and total antibody, the time to maximum concentration occurred 
immediately after infusion.  For free MMAE, the time to maximum concentration was approximately 2 to 3 days after infusion.  Maximum plasma and serum concentration (C
max) and area under the concentration-time curve from Time 0 to infinity (AUC inf) of free 
MMAE appeared to increase with dose across the dose levels tested.  A half-life of 3-4 days for free MMAE was observed, which is relatively long and similar to that of its parent conjugate, suggesting formation rate −limited kinetics of free MMAE.  No 
accumulation of free MMAE is expected for the q3w regimen.  The C
max values of free 
MMAE in NHL patients were at least 100-fold lower than acMMAE concentrations at each dose level, suggesting a slow release of free MMAE from acMMAE and potentially fast elimination once it is formed.  
Preliminary comparisons of pharmacokinetics between patients with NHL and CLL (for 
which patients are enrolled into separate dose-escalation cohorts) treated with identical doses of DCDT2980S provide some insight into the factors that affect pharmacokinetics.  Both acMMAE and total antibody were cleared faster in CLL patients than in NHL patients.  This observation is likely to be related to the high number of circulating B cells generally observed in CLL patients, which may result in significant target-mediated CL of DCDT2980S.  The free MMAE exposure in CLL patients was relatively low compared to that of its parent conjugate.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
70/P GO27834-A2 The exposure parameters (C max and AUC inf) of total antibody, acMMAE, and free MMAE 
were similar between DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S + rituximab at doses of 1.8 and 
2.4 mg/kg, based on preliminary data.  This observation suggests that when given in combination, rituximab does not impact the pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S; the effect of DCDT2980S on rituximab pharmacokinetics will be assessed. 
All observations will be verified with additional data from the ongoing Phase I study as 
well as this study.  
Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure for complete and updated details. 
c. Safety 
Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Study DCT4862g utilizes a standard 3  + [ADDRESS_1050990] been 
observed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1050991] dose of DCDT2980S.  Any patient who did not complete the DLT observation period for any reason other than a DLT was replaced. 
Separate dose-escalation cohorts enrolled patients with B-cell NHL and CLL.  For the 
NHL dose escalation, DLTs of Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient out of 3 DLT-evaluable patients in the 3.2 mg/kg single-agent cohort and 1 patient out of 11 DLT-evaluable patients in the 2.4 mg/kg + rituximab cohort.  Consequently, DCDT2980S at 2.4 mg/kg was determined to be the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) as both monotherapy and in combination with rituximab.   
For the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, one DLT was reported to date.  This Grade 5 event 
of febrile neutropenia resulted in the patient’s death.  Whereas the contribution of the study drug to the neutropenia could not be completely ruled out, other factors, including bone marrow involvement of disease that resulted in baseline anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and clinical evidence of disease progression may have also played a contributory role. 
Single-Agent DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S Combined with Rituximab in 
NHL 
Forty-nine patients received single-agent DCDT2980S at a starting dose of  ≥ 1.8 mg/kg 
(7 at 1.8 mg/kg, 42 at 2.4 mg/kg); 16 patients received DCDT2980S at a starting dose of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg in combination with rituximab (5 at 1.8 mg/kg, 11 at 2.4 mg/kg).  Overall 
the safety profile of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab did not differ from that of single-agent DCDT2980S. 
Treatment-emergent hematologic and commonly reported nonhematologic adverse 
events for all grades in patients treat ed with single-agent DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S 
plus rituximab included neutropenia (29%), febrile neutropenia (3%), infection (system organ class; 43%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (12%), peripheral neuropathy 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
71/P GO27834-A2 (28%), diarrhea (40%), pyrexia (14%), nausea (34%), and fatigue (55%).  
Treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included neutropenia (25%), febrile 
neutropenia (3%), infection (system organ class; 11%), anemia (5%), peripheral neuropathy (3%), diarrhea (5%), pyrexia (2%), and fatigue (3%).  Serious adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_766210]2980S were reported in 21% of patients.   Dose discontinuations for adverse events were reported in 20% of patients. 
Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator’s Brochure for complete and updated details 
related to safety.  
d. Efficacy in Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
Investigator-based objective responses were observed in 17 of 43 (40%) patients trea ted 
with single-agent DCDT2980S and 5 of 15 (33%) patients treated with DCDT2980S combined with rituximab.  Among patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, 11 of 28 (39%) objective responses (5 complete re sponses [CR] and 6 partial responses [PR]) 
were observed with single-agent DCDT2980S and 3 of 7 (43%; 2 CR, 1 PR) with DCDT2980S combined with rituximab.  Among patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL (iNHL), 6 of 13 (46%) objective responses (2 CR, 4 PR) were observed with single-agent DCDT2980S and 1 of 4 (PR) with DCDT2980S combined with rituximab.   
Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure for complete and updated details related 
to anti-tumor activity. 
1.2.2 DCDS4501A  
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Preclinical Data 
CD79b is a cell-surface antigen whose expression is restricted to all mature B cells except plasma cells.  It is expressed in a majority of B cell −derived malignancies, 
including nearly all NHL and CLL samples tested (see Figure 2) (Dornan et al. 2009).  Antibodies bound to CD79b are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570580], making CD79b ideally suited for targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents (Polson et al. 2007, 2009).   
Similar to DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A is an ADC that contains a humanized 
immunoglobulin-G1 (IgG1) anti −human CD79b MAb (MCDS4409A) and MMAE linked 
through MC-VC-PABC.   
Comprehensive pharmacologic, PK, PD, and toxicological evaluations were undertaken to 
support the entry of DCDS4501A into clinical  trials.  Because DCDS4501A specifically 
recognizes CD79b on B cells of human but not on those of cynomolgus monkey, rat, or 
mouse, a surrogate ADC (DCDS5017A) that binds to cynomolgus monkey CD79b was generated to assess the antigen-dependent pharmacological, toxicological, and PK/PD activities in cynomolgus monkeys.  The structure, binding epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], and binding affinity of the surrogate ADC are similar to those of DCDS4501A.

CLL  = chronic lymphocytic leukemia; DLBCL  = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 
FL  = follicular lymphoma; MCL  = mantle cell lymphoma; MFI  = mean fluorescence intensity; 
MZL  = marginal zone lymphoma.  
CD79b expression levels (MFI) on B-cell tumor cells were assessed by [CONTACT_766208] B-cell lymphomas:  CLL (n  = 49), DLBCL (n  = 59), FL (n  = 58), 
MCL (n  = 20), and MZL (n  = 60). 
 
DCDS4501A bound human CD79b with high affinity (K d = 1.83± 0.26 nM); the surrogate 
ADC also showed similar high binding affinity to cynomolgus monkey CD79b.  
DCDS4501A displayed potent and selective inhibiti on of tumor cell proliferation in vitro 
(IC50 = 0.071 nM  ± 0.01 nM) in cell viability assays.  Moderate ADCC but no CDC activity 
was observed with the unconjugated clinical candidate antibody MCDS4409A.  Both clinical and surrogate unconjugated antibodies showed no appreciable cytokine release when evaluated in in vitro cytokine release assays with PBMCs.  Moderate elevations 
in interleukin (IL)-1 α and interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10 were observed only with the 
unconjugated clinical antibody, however the clinical significance of these observations are not known because IL-1 α and IP-10 are not produced by B cells, are not involved in 
B-cell signaling through CD79b, and are not associated with cytokine-release syndromes in vivo. 
Single intravenous (IV) doses of DCDS4501A resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in 
murine xenograft models of lymphoma.  Tumor regression was observed at doses 
ranging from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg.  In contrast, MCDS4409A showed no activity.  DCDS4501A administered at 5 mg/kg demonstrated better anti-tumor activity compared to a current standard-of-care regimen (rituximab plus cy clophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
and prednisone [R-CHOP]) in xenograft models of  NHL.  PD studies demonstrated that 
doses of the surrogate ADC ranging from 0.3 to 5 mg/kg resulted in a decrease of

73/P GO27834-A2 peripheral blood B cells in cynomolgus monkeys.   A preferential decrease of proliferating 
B cells (CD20+ Ki67+) compared to the resting B cells (CD20+ Ki67−) ) by [CONTACT_766211], in line with the expected mechanism of 
action of an anti-mitotic agent, MMAE. 
Due to B cell− mediated CL, non-linear pharmacokinetics were observed with the 
surrogate ADC in cynomolgus monkeys following single IV doses of 0.3 −3 mg/kg or four 
doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg given q3w.  The total antibody exposure after the fourth dose 
increased approximately 1.2- to 1.5-fold compared to the first dose.  As expected, the 
toxicokinetic profile of the clinical ADC in rats and cynomolgus monkeys was linear in the tested dose range.  Consistent with the half-life of the clinical ADC, minimal accumulation was observed following weekly dosing in rats and no accumulation was observed following q3w dosing in cynomolgus  monkeys.  The free MMAE concentrations 
in plasma following administration of the clinical or surrogate ADCs were generally low and overall did not exceed 2 ng/mL, regardless of dose.  The overall incidence of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) was 20% −67% following administration of the clinical 
or surrogate ADCs in cynomolgus monkeys; however, the ATAs did not appear to impact 
the toxicokinetic/PK parameter estimates. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, DCDS4501A and 
the surrogate ADC were well tolerated in monkeys up to doses of 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg respectively, with 3 mg/kg considered the HNSTD.  In rats, DCDS4501A was well tolerated up to 6 mg/kg (STD
10 = 10 mg/kg).  The predominant antigen-independent 
findings associated with DCDS4501A or surrogate ADC exposure were reversible bone marrow toxicity and associated peripheral blood cell effects in both monkeys and rats.  Administration of the surrogate ADC to monkeys also resulted in expected antigen-dependent reversible decreases in peripheral blood B cells and the disappearance of B-cell germinal centers in splenic lymphoid follicles at doses ≥
 3 mg/kg.  
Additional findings observed in rats but not in monkeys included thymic lymphoid depletion at ≥
 6 mg/kg, minimal to mild liver toxicities (at ≥ 6 mg/kg), lung toxicities at 
10 mg/kg in male animals only, and a slight increase in apoptosis and mitoses in multiple tissues, including skin and adnexa.  Hepatobiliary toxicity consisted of transient dose-dependent liver enzyme elevations accompanied by [CONTACT_766282]-dependent increases in mitotic figures/apoptosis in hepatocytes, sinusoidal cells, and bile duct epi[INVESTIGATOR_766120]-dependent random focal hepatic necrosis.  Pulmonary toxicity was characterized by [CONTACT_766282]-dependent alveolar macrophage infiltration, sometimes accompanied by [CONTACT_766283]/hypertr ophy.  These findings were consistent with 
the expected pharmacologic effect of MMAE on inducing mitotic arrest due to inhibition of tubulin polymerization.  Except for two individual instances (one female given 10 mg/kg in the liver and one male given 10 mg/kg in the lung), these findings were completely reversible after a 6-week recovery  period.  Non-reversible male reproductive

[IP_ADDRESS] DCDS4501A Clinical Data 
a. Patient Enrollment 
Both DCDS4501A monotherapy and combination therapy with rituximab are being 
studied in a Phase I study (Study DCS4968g) of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies expected to express CD79b, including indolent NHL, DLBCL, MCL, and CLL.   
All data presented herein is based on a data entry cutoff of 28 February 2013, with 
clinical data available from 60 patients with NHL (excluding patients with CLL) enrolled in dose-escalation and expansion cohorts.  These include 51 patients who were treated with single-agent DCDS4501A ranging from 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg administered intravenously 
every 21 days and 9 patients who were enrolled into a single Phase Ib cohort with DCDS4501A administered at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg in combination with 375 mg/m
2 
rituximab. 
In the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, two DLTs were reported at the single-agent dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.   Enrollment into the CLL cohorts was stopped on 7 January 2013.  Refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure for details regarding clinical data in CLL patients.   
b. Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of DCDS4501A were characterized in the Phase I Study DCDS4501A.  DCDS4501A was administered in patients with NHL at escalating doses of 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg q3w as monotherapy and following administration of rituximab in the Phase Ib cohort.  Three analytes were quantified:  acMMAE, total antibody, and free MMAE.  
Preliminary PK analysis based on available data as of 22 June 2012 is summarized 
below.  The CL estimates of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level is in the 
range of 14.9–21.2 mL/day/kg and 7.12–27.9 mL/day/kg, respectively.  CL estimates 
were similar across doses of 0.1–2.4 mg/kg tested, suggesting dose-proportional increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposure.  The CL of acMMAE was faster than 
that of total antibody at each dose level.   
The mean value of V
ss of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level ranged from 
61 to 80.8 mL/kg and from 59.4 to 114.3 mL/kg, respectively, across the dose levels 
tested, which approximated human serum volume.  V ss values did not appear to change 
substantially with dose.  The half-lives for acMMAE and total antibody are from 2.4 to 
5.5 days and 2.9 to 7 days, respectively.  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
75/P GO27834-A2 In a single-agent dose-escalation study, for acMMAE and total antibody, the time to 
maximum concentration occurred immediately after infusion.  For free MMAE, the time to maximum concentration was approximately 2 to 3 days after infusion.  C
max and AUC inf of 
free MMAE appear increased with dose across the dose levels.  A half-life of 3–4 days for free MMAE was observed, which is relatively long and similar to acMMAE and suggests formation rate −limited kinetics for free MMAE.  No accumulation of free MMAE 
is expected for the q3w regimen.  The C
max values of free MMAE in NHL patients were at 
least 100-fold lower compared with acMMA E concentrations at each dose level, 
suggesting a slow release of free MMAE from acMMAE and potentially fast elimination once it is formed.   
Preliminary comparisons of pharmacokinetics between patients with NHL and CLL (for 
which patients are enrolled into separate dose-escalation cohorts) treated with identical doses of DCDS4501A provide some insight into t he factors that affect pharmacokinetics.  
Both acMMAE and total antibody were cleared faster in CLL patients than in NHL patients.  This observation is likely to be related to the high number of circulating B cells generally observed in CLL patients, which may result in significant target-mediated CL of DCDS4501A.  The free MMAE exposure in CLL patients was relatively low compared with that of its parent conjugate. 
To date, PK data for patients treated with DCDS4501A in combination with rituximab is 
limited.  Consequently, full comparison wi th single-agent DCDS4501A pharmacokinetics 
is not possible.  On the basis of very limited data from 3 patients, total antibody pharmacokinetics was comparable between 2.4 mg/kg of DCDS4501A administered as a single agent and following rituximab administration, suggesting that when given in combination, rituximab does not affect the pharmacokinetics of DCDS4501A; the effect of DCDS4501A on rituximab pharmacokinetics will be assessed.   
All observations will be verified with additional data from the ongoing Phase I study as 
well as this study. 
Refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure for complete and updated details. 
c. Safety 
Dose-Limiting Toxicities  
Study DCS4968g utilizes a standard 3  + [ADDRESS_1050992] dose of DCDS4501A.  Any patient who did not complete the DLT observation period for any reason other t han 
a DLT was replaced. 
DLT of Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient out of 10 DLT-evaluable patients in the 
2.4 mg/kg single-agent cohort and 1 patient out of 9 DLT-evaluable patients in the 2.4 mg/kg +  rituximab cohort.  Doses of DCDS4501A greater than 2.4 mg/kg as 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
76/P GO27834-A2 monotherapy or in combination with ritu ximab were not assessed.  Consequently, 
DCDS4501A at 2.4 mg/kg was therefore determined to be the RP2D as both 
monotherapy and in combination with rituximab.  Patients are currently being enrolled in monotherapy expansion cohorts for various types  of NHL in order to collect and further 
characterize both single-agent and combination safety data.  
In the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, two DLTs were reported at the single-agent dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.  One patient had a Grade 4 neutropenia, and 1 patient had a Grade 4 invasive fungal infection.   
Single-Agent DCDS4501A and DCDS4501A Combined with Rituximab  
Fifty-one patients received single-agent DCDS4501A at a starting dose of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg 
(6 at 1.8 mg/kg, 45 at 2.4 mg/kg); an additional 9 patients received DCDS4501A at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg in combination with rituximab.  Overall, the safety profile of DCDS4501A combined with rituximab did not differ from that of single-agent DCDS4501A. 
Treatment-emergent hematologic and commonly reported non-hematologic adverse 
events of all grades in patients treated with single-agent DCDS4501A and DCDS4501A plus rituximab included neutropenia (50%), febrile neutropenia (5%), infection (system organ class; 35%), anemia (13%), thrombocytopenia (18%), peripheral neuropathy (32%), diarrhea (43%), pyrexia (37%), nausea (35%), and fatigue (18%).  Treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included neutropenia (43%), febrile 
neutropenia (5%), infection (system organ class; 10%), anemia (8%), peripheral neuropathy (7%), diarrhea (3%), pyrexia (2%), and fatigue (5%).   Serious adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_766215]4501A were reported in 20% of patients.   Dose discontinuations for adverse events were reported in 33% of patients. 
Refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator’s Brochure for complete and updated details 
related to safety.   
d. Efficacy 
Investigator-based objective responses were observed in 28 of 49 (57%) patients trea ted 
with single-agent DCDS4501A and 7 of 9 patients (78%) treated with DCDS4501A combined with rituximab.  Among patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, objective responses were observed in 16 of 30 (53%; 4 CR, 12 PR) patients treated with DCDS4501A; 1 patient with DLBCL was treated with DCDS4501A combined with rituximab and achieved a PR.  Among patients with relapsed or refractory iNHL, objective responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%; 2 CR, 5 PR) patients treated with single-agent DCDS4501A and 5 of 5 (100%; 2 CR, 3 PR) patients treated with DCDS4501A plus rituximab.

1.2.3 Rituximab  
Rituximab has been shown to be an effective treatment for CD20-positive B-cell malignancies and is commonly used both as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Rituximab binds  to CD20, a hydrophobic, transmembrane 
protein that is present on pre–B cells and mature B cells and in ≥ 90% of B-cell NHLs.  
It exerts its cytotoxic effects via complem ent-mediated B-cell lysis, ADCC, and induction 
of apoptosis (Cartron et al. 2004). 
In the [LOCATION_002], rituximab has been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the following indications in NHL:  as a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive B-cell NHL; for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive B-cell NHL, including initia l treatment weekly for eight doses and 
re-treatment (weekly for four doses) in patients who responded to an initial course of rituximab; for the treatment of low-grade, CD20-positive B-cell NHL, in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) induction chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with follicular, CD20-positive NHL; as treatment in previously untreated patients with low- grade, CD20-positive NHL who achieve an 
objective response or stable disease (SD) following CVP induction; and as maintenance therapy for previously untreated follicular CD20-positive B-cell NHL after achieving a 
response to a regimen including chemotherapy and rituximab. 
In the European Union, rituximab (MabThera
®) is approved for the treatment of the 
following indications in NHL:  treatment of patients with Stage III–IV follicular NHL who 
are chemotherapy-resistant or in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy; treatment of patients with CD20-positive DLBCL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy; as front-line therapy in Stage III–IV follicular NHL in combination with CVP chemotherapy; as maintenance therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory, follicular NHL responding to induction treatment with CHOP or R-CHOP; and as maintenance treatment for patients with FL who have responded to initial treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy. 
Rituximab has also been approved for the treatment of CLL.  The European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) granted an approval for the use of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated CLL.  The FDA approved the use of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for patients with previously untreated and previously treated CD20-positive CLL.

1.2.4 Obinutuzumab  
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Mechanism of Action 
Obinutuzumab ([G], also known as RO5072759, GA101, Gazyva ™, and Gazyvaro ™) is 
a humanized type II and glycoe ngineered anti-CD20 MAb, de rived by [CONTACT_177205] B-Ly1 mouse antibody and subs equent glycoengineering leading to the 
following characteristics (Mössner et al. 2010; Golay et al. 2013): 
• High-affinity binding to CD20 antigen on B cells 
• Type II binding mode to the CD20 antigen, leading to a more even distribution of 
bound antibody to the surface membrane of the B cell due to lack of CD20 
translocation into lipid rafts after antibody binding and low complement activation 
and low complement-dependent cytotoxicity related to the recognition of the CD20 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]  
• Compared with the type I anti-CD20 antibodies rituximab or ofatumumab, 
increased ADCC and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) 
related to an improved binding of obinutuzumab to the different allotypes of 
FcγRIIIa and Fc γRIIIb  expressed by [CONTACT_113921] (NK) cells , 
monocytes/macrophage s and neutrophils 
• Compared with rituximab, increased direct cell-death induction related to an elbow 
hinge amino exchange of the Fab region and type II binding of the CD20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_766163] [ADDRESS_1050993] udy BO21004 for patients with relapsed 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.  Obinutuzum ab plus chlorambucil showed superiority 
over rituximab plus chlorambucil in all e fficacy parameters such as overall response 
rate (ORR), complete remi ssion rate (CRR), minimal residual disease (MRD), 
progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS), and duration of response 
(DOR) (Goede et al. 2014). 
Obinutuzumab is currently being explored in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies 
such as aggressive and indolent lymphomas (DLBCL, FL, and marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]).  Preliminary data suggest possible increased anti-lymphoma efficacy over rituximab, a hypothesis that is  currently being explored in  several random ized trials, 
including a Phase III study of R-CHOP versus G-CHOP in first-line treatment of DLBCL, a Phase III study of R-chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine) followed 
by [CONTACT_766218] G-chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine) followed by [CONTACT_766219]-line treatment of FL and MZL, and a Phase III study of obinutuzum ab combined with bendamustine compared 
with bendamustine in patients with rituximab-refractory indolent NHL.

79/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology of obinutuzumab has been evaluated in repeat-dose studies 
in cynomolgus monkeys given weekly IV (30-minute infusion) up to 26 weeks in 
duration and weekly SC injections for 4 we eks in duration.  The high dose of 50 mg/kg 
in the 26-week study resulted in a steady-state area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC
0−24) exposure of 341,000 μg•hr/mL, which is approximately 
61-fold above that of the clinical exposure of 5584 μg•hr/mL. 
Consistent with expected pharmacologic activity, obinutuzumab caused marked decreases in B cells, with corresponding lymp hoid depletion in spleen and lymph nodes.  
Circulating CD40-positive mature B cells began to reverse after several months without treatment and maxima lly reversed to 7%
−152% of baseline by 37 weeks.  In addition, 
transient decreases in NK cells were observed; this finding is consistent with the pharmacologic effect of Fc
γRIIIa binding.  Suspected opportunistic infections in as 
many as three unscheduled deaths were considered a possible secondary result of B-cell depletion. 
Obinutuzumab was immunogenic in the cy nomolgus monkey, which led to reduced 
systemic exposures in several animals and abrogation of the pharmacologic activity.  
Hypersensitivity reactions were noted that included systemic inflammation and infiltrates consistent with immune complex
−mediated hypersensitivity reactions such 
as arteritis/periarteritis, glomerulonephr itis, and serosal/adventitial inflammation and 
led to unscheduled termination in six animals. 
Both the clinical IV formulation and the SC  formulation of obinutuzumab were locally 
well tolerated across studies.  No effects were present in male and female reproductive 
parameters included in the 26-week IV dose study.  No obinutuzumab-related effects were observed on CNS, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or cardiovascular function. 
In vitro assays using undiluted human whol e blood measured significant increases in 
cytokine secretion caused by [CONTACT_766286], indicating that obinutuzumab has an 
increased propensity to trigger first infusion
−related cytokine release in patients. 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Efficacy 
Obinutuzumab has in vivo efficacy superior to rituximab in various human lymphoma xenograft models.  Both antibodies were tested in human SUDHL-4 cells (DLBCL model) injected subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice.  Rituximab administration was started when  tumors were esta blished and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_766122].  Results showed that rituximab at 10 mg/kg inhibited tumor growth compared with rituximab at 1 mg/kg; however, increasi ng the rituximab dose to 30 mg/kg did not 
result in increased efficacy and rituximab was not able to achieve complete tumor 
regression.  In contrast, obin utuzumab showed a dose-depen dent increase in efficacy in 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
80/P GO27834-A2 the range of 1 −30 mg/kg.  Results showed complete tumor regression in all animals and 
lasting tumor eradication in [ADDRESS_1050994] dose of 30 mg/kg and in 
1 of 10 animals at a dose of 10 mg/kg. 
In another experiment, SUDHL4 xenografts in SCID mice were first treated with 
weekly rituximab 30 mg/kg.  When the tumors became refractory to rituximab (Day 35), rituximab treatment was contin ued or changed to either weekly vehicle 
control or obinutuzumab 30 mg/kg.  While tumors in control- and rituximab-treated 
mice continued to grow, obinutuzumab-treated mice showed control of tumor growth and lived until Day [ADDRESS_1050995] also shown similar results, with obinutuzumab treatment 
controlling tumor growth, whereas vehicle- and rituximab-treated tumors were not controlled (Mössner et al. 2010). 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Clinical Experience 
As of July 2013, more than [ADDRESS_1050996] 
been treated with obinutuzumab in clinical trials.  Clinical data for obinutuzumab are 
available from six clinical trials, including three Phase I and Phase II studies of 
obinutuzumab monotherapy, a Phase Ib chemotherapy combination study in NHL (Study BO21000), and two Phase III studies (Study BO21004 in CLL and Study GAO4753g in NHL). 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs), mostly Grades [ADDRESS_1050997] infusion, generally occurring early during the infusion, shortly after the infusion, or, in some cases, up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion.  In a few patients, concurrent signs of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were observed.  The incidence and intensity of IRRs decreased strongly with subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab.  On the basis of preliminary observations, extensive tumor burden, tumor factors, and host factors may be predisposing factors for the occurrence of IRRs.  The frequency and severity of IRRs is also reduced in lymphomas compared with CLL. 
Other frequently observed adverse events include infections and neutropenia.  
Grade 3

reported with obinutuzumab, associated predominantly with treatment of CLL rather than NHL.  Given its anticipated mode of action, which results in profound B-cell depletion, obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections during and after treatment. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
81/P GO27834-A2 Data from Study BO20999 (obinutuzumab monotherapy) showed safety and efficacy of 
single-agent obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed indolent and aggressive lymphomas.  Respons es were seen at both lower (400 mg) and higher (1600/800 mg) 
doses, although responses increased at the higher dose, with 54% of patients with indolent lymphoma and 32% of patients with  aggressive lymphomas showing PR or CR 
at the end of treatment (EOT) (Morschhaus er et al. 2013; Salles et al. 2013).   
Study BO21000 (Phase Ib) evaluated obinutuzum ab in combination with chemotherapy:  
obinutuzumab with fludarabine and cyclop hosphamide and obinutuzumab with CHOP 
(Radford et al. 2013).  Both chemotherapy co mbinations were shown to be feasible in 
patients with previously untreated or relapsed or refractory FL, with response rates of 
> 90% for both regimens.  Safety was acceptable, with no new or unexpected adverse 
events observed.  The most common adverse event was neutropenia. 
Data from obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in CLL (Phase III 
Study BO21004) showed increased ef ficacy of this combination over 
rituximab-chlorambucil, with a hazard ratio of 0.39 for PFS.  IRRs were common 
(65% all grades, 20% Grade 3 −4, no fatal IRRs) and neutropenia occurred at increased 
frequency with the combination therapy (33% Grade 3 −5), but there was no increase in 
infections or treatment-related deaths (Goede et al. 2014). 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on the clinical studies. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab Pharmacokine tics and Pharmacodynamics 
A two-compartment model comprising a time-varying CL pathway and a linear CL pathway provides an adequate description of the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab following IV administration in Study BO20999 and Stud y BO21003.  Following the 
infusion of obinutuzumab, the elimination appears to be characterized by a linear CL pathway that is dependent on time (i.e., st arting at a typi[INVESTIGATOR_27797] 630 mL/day and 
then gradually decreasing to an asymptote of 60 mL/day at steady state).  Tumor burden may potentially contribute significantly to the CL of obinutuzumab, especially at the beginning of treatment  when CD20-positive tumor cells are most abundant.  As 
tumor burden decreases, the CL reaches an asymptote, which is considered to be primarily a function of the proteolytic metabolic CL.  Some patients with a high tumor burden may appear to clear the drug from the plasma faster than patients with a low tumor burden because obinutuzumab binds to the CD20-positive tumor cells and is effectively removed from the plasma.  The CL  of the drug will vary with time because 
repeated treatments with obinutuzumab will reduce the quantity of CD20-positive tumor cells.  The number of times obinutuzum ab is administered during the first cycle 
of treatment may be expected to reduce the number of CD20-positive tumor cells, thus minimizing the impact of the time-varyin g CL pathway on obinutuzumab exposure.

showing a reduction in B-cell counts to absolute zero at some stage of their treatment cycle.  Overall, there has been no notable increase in complement levels before and after infusion, but transient increases occurring du ring the administration of obinutuzumab 
have been observed in the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-
α, interleukin (IL)-6, 
IL-8, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)- γ. 
1.3 RATIONALE FOR DOING THIS STUDY 
The goals of this study are to continue to assess the safety, tolerability, and biologic and clinical activity of the combinations of DCDT2980S and rituximab and DCDS4501A and rituximab in two specific NHL patient populations:  patients with relapsed or refractory 
follicular NHL and patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.  An additional goal of this 
study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and potential biologic and clinical activity of 
DCDS4501A in combination wi th obinutuzumab, an anti-CD20 antibody, in the 
aforementioned NHL patient populations.  These patients continue to have an 
extremely poor prognosis with no curative options available.  Consequently, new 
therapeutic options are needed.   
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A , rituximab, and obinutuzumab each target antigens specific 
to B-cell malignancies including follicular NHL and DLBCL (see Figures 1 and 2).  
The randomized component of the Phase II study design permits an assessment of the 
clinical benefit provided by [CONTACT_766220], which 
has established clinical activity in B- cell malignancies both as monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy.  Data from this study will help inform the feasibility of the combination regimens in earlier lines of therapy (e.g., as first-line therapy in newly diagnosed patients).   
The non-randomized component of the study will further evaluate the safety and 
tolerability and clinical activity of DCDS 4501A in combination wi th obinutuzumab in 
patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma or DLBCL and will also provide preliminary evidence as to which anti-CD20 agent, rituximab or obinutuzumab, in combination with DCDS4501A, provides a better benefit-risk profile 
in the target population being studied.  
The feasibility of combining an ADC with ritu ximab has previously been tested clinically 
with the combination of another, different CD22-specific ADC, inotuzumab ozogamicin 
(CMC-544), with results suggesting that the addition of rituximab may have increased clinical activity without significant increase in toxicity over the ADC alone in patients with aggressive NHL (Luis et al. 2006; Nam et al. 2009; Nina et al. 2010).  As noted in Sections 1.2.[ADDRESS_1050999] acceptable safety in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL in the Phase I studies (Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g).   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
83/P GO27834-A2 Given the relatively poor prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic 
malignancies that have failed standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the nonclinical toxicity profile associated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A treatm ent, and the clinical safety profile 
observed to date for both ADCs, the benefit-risk ratio of a clinical study of DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A, each combined with rituximab or obinutuzumab , is considered 
acceptable.  
1.3.1 Rationale for Assessing ADC Dose of 1.8 mg/kg Combined with 
Rituximab in iNHL  
On the basis of available Phase I data (see Sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2), both DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A as single agents and combined with rituximab have shown early signs of clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory NHL.  However, early evidence in the Phase I studies indicate that duration of study treatment may be limited by [CONTACT_766221].  Specifically, for both ADCs, peripheral sensory neuropathy has been identified as a known risk (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Notably, [ADDRESS_1051000] shown single-agent activity at the 1.8 mg/kg dose level (Advani et al. 2012; Palanca-Wessels et al. 2012), the purpose of enrolling additional cohorts of patients with FL is to determine whether lower doses of ADC in combination with standard doses of rituximab result in improved tolerability while maintaining efficacy in FL.   
In contrast to iNHL, treatment paradigms in relapsed or refractory aggressive 
lymphomas such as DLBCL continue to place a premium on anti-tumor activity and higher tolerance for treatment-related toxicity, given that durations of disease control and survival are substantially shorter and that tr eatment options are extremely limited.  Early 
Phase I data suggest lower rates of study treatment discontinuation for adverse events among patients with DLBCL compared with patients with iNHL.  Taken together with anti-tumor activity observed to date, the benefit-risk profile of the currently tested ADC dose of 2.4 mg/kg is considered acceptable  
1.3.2 Rationale for Assessing DCDS 4501A in Combination with 
Obinutuzumab in Relapsed or Refractory NHL  
The development of next-generation anti-CD20 −directed therapy may further enhance 
the efficacy of current standard regimens for NHL.  Obinutuzumab, also known as RO5072759, GA101, and Gazyva
™/Gazyvaro ™, a novel type II and glycoengineered 
anti-CD20 antibody, has shown superiority over rituximab in a Phase III trial in first-line CLL (Goede et al. 2014).  Obinutuzumab is cu rrently being compared with 
rituximab in two large Phase III studies in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL (Study BO21005) and with previous ly untreated iNHL, including FL 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
84/P GO27834-A2 (Study BO21223).  Assuming these studies de monstrate grea ter clinical benefit with 
obinutuzumab- vs. rituximab-containing regimens, potentially altering the standard of 
care in NHL, it will be important to also  assess the safety and efficacy of combining 
DCDS4501A with obinutuzumab-containing regimens. 
The goals of the non-randomized portion of the Phase Ib study are to assess the safety, 
tolerability, and potential biol ogic and clinical activity of DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in 
combination with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL 
or DLBCL.  The RP2D, the Phase II dose-expansion portion of the study, will further evaluate the safety and tolerability and clinic al activity of DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in 
combination with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL 
or DLBCL.

DCDS4501A  
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomized Portion of the Study (Arms A and B)  
Following determination of eligibility, patients within each disease group will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments: 
• Arm A:  Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S (2.4 mg/kg) every 21 days; 
• Arm B:  Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A (2.4 mg/kg) every [ADDRESS_1051001] to the 
following stratification factors: 
• For patients with FL (see Section 3.1.4 for definitions) 
Rituximab refractory disease ( no response or disease relapse <  [ADDRESS_1051002] rituximab treatment) versus rituximab relapsed disease (disease relapse 
after response ≥  [ADDRESS_1051003] rituximab treatment) 
• For patients with DLBCL (see Section 3.1.5 for definitions) 
Second-line versus third-line (or beyond) therapy 
For second-line patients, disease relapse or no objective response (CR, 
unconfirmed CR [CRu], or PR) <12 months from the start of initial therapy versus disease relapse, after initial objective response (CR, unconfirmed response 
[CRu] or PR), ≥  [ADDRESS_1051004]-line patients, failure to achieve a CR or progression < [ADDRESS_1051005] recent therapy versus CR or progression ≥ [ADDRESS_1051006] recent therapy 
No formal testing comparing the two treatment arms in the randomized portion of the study is planned. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Randomized Portion of the Study with Rituximab  
(Cohorts C and D)  
Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the non-randomized portion of the study will enroll patients into these cohorts. 
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled in Cohorts C and D to 
receive rituximab (375 mg/m
2) combined with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A at a dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.  The first day of treatment constitutes Day 1 of each cycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766116] 21 days in duration. 
The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s discretion and only after 
the enrollment of patients with FL into the randomized portion of the study is completed.  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
89/P GO27834-A2 Patients will not be randomized to receive one treatment or the other.  It is anticipated 
that Cohort C and D will be opened sequentially.   
3.1.2 All Patients  on Rituximab-Cont aining Arms/Cohorts   
All patients on rituximab-containing regimens , regardless of assigned arm/cohort, will 
receive DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab administered by [CONTACT_766203] a 21-day cycle.  For the first two cycles, rituximab will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 1 and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 2.  In the absence of any infusion-related adverse events, rituximab and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent cycles beginning with the third cycle.  In this instance, rituximab will be administered first, 
followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S or DCDS4501A.  In certain circumstances
⎯for example, IRRs 
requiring interruption or slowing of infusion rate ⎯rituximab may be administered over 
2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the cycle); in this case, DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A 
may be administered on Day 2 following completion of the rituximab infusion or on Day 3 of the cycle. 
Patients may receive treatments for up to 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day 
schedule) if not discontinued because of significant toxicity, disease progression, or withdrawal from study. 
Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the Schedules 
of Assessments outlined in Appendices A-1, A-2,  and A-4.  Initial response assessments 
in this study will be performed every 3 months  from the initiation of therapy until study 
treatment completion or early termination (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1051007] eight  21-day cycles of treatment).  Additional 
response assessments for patients who proceed to crossover treatment (see Section 3.1.6) will be performed as described in Appendix A-2; response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment (both initially assigned treatment and crossover treatment) for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as 
described in Appendix A -4. 
Responses to study treatment will be based on investigator assessments.  In addition, 
tumor assessment data will be transmitted to an Independent Review Facility (IRF) for collection and possible independent review.  
3.1.3 Obinutuzumab-Containing Regime n with DCDS4501A (Cohorts E, 
G, and H)  
DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg will be given in comb ination with obinutuzumab to patients 
with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL an d DLBCL in two stages:  (1) safety run-in 
and (2) expansion. 
Study treatment will be given in 21-day cycl es for both follicular NHL and DLBCL.  
Patients will be treated for up to a total of  [ADDRESS_1051008] cycle, obinutuzumab 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
90/P GO27834-A2 will be administered by [CONTACT_766299] 1, 8, and 15.  DCDS4501A will be given 
on Day 2 for Cycle 1.  In the absence of any infusion-related adverse events, 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A may be admini stered on the same day (Day 1) in 
subsequent cycles beginning with the second cycle.  If obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A are administered on the same day, the study drugs will be given sequentially.  Obinutuzumab will be administered first , followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A.  In certain 
circumstances
⎯for example, IRRs requiring interruption or slowing of infusion 
rate⎯obinutuzumab may be administered over 2 days (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the 
cycle); in this case, DCDS4501A may be admini stered on Day 2 following completion of 
the obinutuzumab infusion. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Obinutuzumab-Containing Re gimen in Phase Ib: Safety 
Run-In (Cohort E) 
This portion of the study will consist of a safety run-in that will evaluate the safety of DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in combination with obinutuzumab in 6 patients (Cohort E).  
The safety run-in is described in detail in Section 3.4.  In case an amendment to the protocol allows to study higher doses of  DCDS4501A, the safety run-in for the 
1.8 mg/kg may be shor tened to 3 patients. 
Obinutuzumab-Containing Regimens  in Phase II:  Expansion Stage 
(Cohorts G and H) 
After the safety run-in has demonstr ated that DCDS4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in 
combination with obinutuzumab is safe to administer, patients will be enrolled into two expansion cohorts based on histology of follicular NHL or DLBCL (Cohorts G and H, 
respectively).  Forty patients will be enrolled into each expansion cohort.  An 
additional cohort(s) may be added in the future.  
3.1.4 Follicular NHL Patients for Rituximab-Containing 
Arms/Cohorts  
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled into the study as defined by [CONTACT_716]: 
• Relapsed
 as documented history of response (CR, CRu, or PR) of ≥ 6 months in 
duration from completion of all prior  rituximab-containing regimens.  A 
rituximab-containing regimen is defined as rituximab as a single agent during 
induction and/or maintenance or in combination with other agents during induction 
and/or maintenance. 
• Refractory  to any prior  regimen containing rituximab, defined as no response to or 
progression within [ADDRESS_1051009] dose of rituximab therapy (either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy), including:

3.1.8 Crossover Treatment (Randomized Patients in Arms A and B  
Only) 
Patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B who develop progressive disease may be 
eligible to receive crossover treatment consisting of rituximab and the other ADC or the other ADC alone ⎯for example, Arm B treatment for patients who have disease 
progression while receiving Arm A treatment, and vice versa ⎯provided the following 
conditions are met: 
• Patients must not have experienced a toxicity requiring the discontinuation of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment OR experienced toxicity during the last dose of 
study treatment that would preclude treatment with the crossover regimen. 
Patients who had modifications to dosing and/or schedule on the initial study treatment will be permitted to receive crossover treatment in the absence of 
toxicities on the modified dose and/or schedule.  The dose and schedule of crossover treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_40906]. 
Patients who had rituximab discontinued and continued on single-agent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment may receive crossover treatment of 
single-agent DCDS4501A/ DCDT2980S. 
• Patients must have radiographically documented disease progression. 
• Patients must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Sections 4.1.1 
and 4.1.2, except for those related to prior rituximab treatment. 
• Acceptable toxicity:  All study drug–relat ed adverse events from the initial study 
treatment must have decreased to Grade [ADDRESS_1051012] 
day of treatment on the crossover regimen.  Exceptions may be allowed after a careful assessment and discussion of the benefit-risk balance with the patient by [CONTACT_766223]. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
93/P GO27834-A2 • Administration of crossover treatment must be in the best interests of the patient as 
determined after a careful assessment and discussion of benefit-risk balance with 
the patient by [CONTACT_766224]. 
• A tumor biopsy (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will be required for patients with safely 
accessible site of disease, defined as requiring only local anesthesia and, in 
general, excluding the brain, lungs or any internal organs that may subject patients to significant risk.  
Patients for whom a safely accessible site of disease is not present may still receive crossover treatment without undergoi ng a biopsy.  Eligibility to receive 
crossover treatment should be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_1689]. 
A tumor biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease is optional for patients who 
are not eligible for study cross over.  
 
Patients who are determined to be eligible for study cross over will be treated as follows: 
• Assessments obtained at the initial study treatment discontinuation visit 
(see Section 4.5.4) may be used as screening assessments for crossover treatment.  
The following re-screening assessments must be repeated/obtained within 1 week 
prior to starting treatment on the crossover regimen, in order to re-establish baseline 
pretreatment clinical and disease status:  targeted physical exam, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, and hematology and serum chemistry 
laboratory tests. 
Re-screening tests for hepatitis B and C do not need to be performed unless there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_136701] B and/or C positivity. 
A radiographic tumor assessment must also be performed, unless already done 
to document disease progression, within 6 weeks prior to starting crossover 
treatment. 
• Crossover treatment will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1051013] dose of the prior 
study treatment. 
 
Patients will be treated with the crossover treatment until a second disease progression 
event relative to the tumor assessment, documenting progressive disease on the initial study treatment, clinical deterioration, and/or intolerance to the crossover treatment for up to a maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule).  Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules of assessments outlined in Appendices A-2.  Response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment 
for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as described in 
Appendix A- 4.  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
94/P GO27834-A2 Clinical data and exploratory data derived from tumor biopsies obtained prior to 
crossover treatment will be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Genentech has the right to restrict or suspend enrollment into crossover treatment at any time.  Reasons for this may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The incidence or severity of adverse events during crossover treatment indicates a 
potential safety hazard to patients. 
• Patient enrollment into crossover treatment is unsatisfactory. 
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.  • Patients who are enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C, 
D, E, G, and H ) will not have the option to receive crossover treatment upon 
disease progression (see Section 3.2 for rationale). 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1051014] study treatment and following progressive disease will provide further understanding of disease biology, possible mechanisms of resistance to the study treatment, and initial insights into tumor subtypes based on tumor biomarkers that are sensitive to study treatment.  Finally , the inclusion of study treatment crossover 
(see Section 3.1.8) will address important questions regarding efficacy and tolerability of a second ADC-rituximab combination following disease progression on the initial ADC-rituximab combination.  
The primary rationale for the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and D)  is 
to assess the therapeutic index (i.e., the balance of efficacy and tolerability of 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL).  An informal comparison between patients with follicular NHL treated at the two doses of the ADC will help determine if tolerability is improved at the lower ADC dose without substantial compromise of efficacy.   
The clinical feasibility of an ADC-rituximab combination regimen in patients with relapsed 
or refractory NHL has been previously studied.  Results from studies of rituximab in 
combination with a different CD22-specific ADC, inotuzumab ozogamicin, demonstrated that when combined with rituximab, the ADC was able to be given at the single-agent 
MTD without the need for dose reduction of the ADC because of the lack of significant 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171] (Luis et al. 2006; Nam et al. 2009; Nina et al. 2010). 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A are both being evaluated as single agents and in 
combination with rituximab in the ongoing Phase I studies Study DCT4862g and 
Study DCS4968g, respectively.  Results from these trials have determined an MTD of 
2.4 mg/kg for single-agent DCDT2980S and an RP2D of 2.4 mg/kg for single-agent 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
95/P GO27834-A2 DCDS4501A in patients with mixed NHL.  In addition, the RP2D of DCT2980S and 
DCDS4501 each in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m2) on an every-21-day 
schedule was determined to be 2.4 mg/kg.  Study GO27834 will continue to assess the cumulative safety and longer-term tolerability of ADC-rituximab combination therapy. 
The primary rationale for the non-randomized Phase Ib/II obinutuzumab-containing 
cohorts (Cohorts E
−H) is to assess safety and clinical activity for the combination of 
obinutuzumab and DCDS4501A in patients wi th relapsed/refractor y NHL (Cohorts E, 
G, and H).   Obinutuzumab (also known as RO5072759, GA101 and 
Gazyva™/Gazyvaro ™), a novel type II and glycoeng ineered anti-CD20 antibody, has 
shown superiority over rituximab in a Phase III trial in first-line CLL (Goede et al. 
2014).  Obinutuzumab is curr ently being compared with rituximab in two large 
Phase III studies in patients with ne wly diagnosed DLBCL (Study BO21005) and 
previously untreated iNHL, including FL (S tudy BO21223).  Assuming these studies 
demonstrate greater clinical benefit with obinutuzumab- vs. rituximab-containing 
regimens, potentially altering th e standard of care in NHL, it will be important to also 
assess the safety and efficacy of combining DCDS4501A with obinutuzumab-
containing regimens. 
Study drug dosing will occur on Days 1 or 2 of each 21-day (or 28-day) cycle to allow for 
recovery from potential bone marrow toxicity. 
3.2.[ADDRESS_1051015] of peripheral B-cell counts, tumor burden, and target antigen expression on target -mediated drug CL over multiple doses 
of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A plus rituximab or obinutuzumab  when the two drugs are 
given in combination, the drug levels of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A-related analytes 
and rituximab or obinutuzumab  will be assessed in this combination study.   
In Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, single-agent DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A 
administered by [CONTACT_33433] 21 days we re evaluated at doses ranging from 0.1 to 
3.2 mg/kg for DCDT2980S and 0.1 mg/kg to 2.4 mg/kg for DCDS4501A in patients with NHL.  Intensive PK sampling of all patients in the ongoing Phase I studies will provide sufficient data to allow complete profiling of the distribution and elimination phases for DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A and the investigation of potential correlations between various PK parameters and efficacy and/or toxicity.  Consequently a reduced PK sampling scheme of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A will be used in this study.  
The PK data collected in this study will allow further characterization of the PK properties 
of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  In addition, the DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A concentration results from this study will be compared with available data from the single-agent clinical studies to evaluate whether concurrent administration of rituximab affects the exposure of DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
96/P GO27834-A2 Rituximab serum concentration measurements from this study will be compared with 
PK data from historical rituximab clinical studies to evaluate whether the combination 
with DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A affects the pharmacokinetics of rituximab.  
Limited sampling of serum concentrations of obinutuzumab will be assessed and 
compared with historical data to evaluate potential PK interactions with DCDS4501A.  
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES 
3.3.1 Safety Outcome Measures  
The safety and tolerability of the combination of DCDT2980S and rituximab and 
DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab will be assessed using the following safety 
outcome measures: 
• Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events 
• Incidence of anti-DCDT2980S , anti-DCDS4501A, or anti-obinutuzumab  antibodies 
• Changes in vital signs 
• Changes in laboratory values 
  
3.3.2 Pharmacokinetic/Pharm acodynamic Outcome Measures  
The following PK parameters will be derived from the serum concentration–time profiles 
of total antibody (the sum of conjugated and unconjugated antibody), including rituximab  
or obinutuzumab , and plasma concentration-time profiles of acMMAE and free MMAE 
following administration of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A, when appropriate, as data allow: 
• Total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) 
• Maximum plasma and serum concentration (C
max) 
• CL • Terminal half-life (t
1/2) 
• V ss 
 
Compartmental, non-compartmental, and/or population methods may be used.  Other 
parameters, such as accumulation ratio and trough plasma and serum concentration (C
min), may also be calculated. 
The following PD outcome measures will be assessed when appropriate, as data allow: 
• Peripheral blood B-cell depletion and recovery.  For each visit at which CD19+ B-cell 
measurements are taken, B-cell data will be listed for each patient by [CONTACT_766225]: 
Absolute blood cell counts 
Percent change relative to the baseline blood counts 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
97/P GO27834-A2 CD19+ B-cell recovery, defined as the timepoint when the values return to 
baseline levels or ≥ 50% of baseline levels 
• Assessment of the kinetics of circulating tumor DNA  
 
3.3.3 Activity Outcome Measures  
The following activity outcome measures will be assessed: 
• Objective response, defined as a PR or CR 
• Duration of objective response, defined as the duration of time from the  first 
occurrence of a documented objective response to time of relapse or death from 
any cause 
• PFS, defined as the duration from randomization to the first occurrence of 
progression or death within [ADDRESS_1051016] 
• OS, defined as the duration  from the date of randomization /enrollment  to the date 
of death from any cause 
 
Objective response and disease progression will be determined using standard criteria 
for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007, 2014; see Appendix C-1 and Appendix C-2). 
3.3.4 Exploratory Outcome Measures   
The exploratory outcome measures will include, but will not be limited to, the following:  
• Confirmation and quantitation of CD22, CD79b, and CD20 expression levels in 
either archival or freshly obtained (w hen available) tumor specimens (tumor 
biopsies, bone marrow biopsies, peripheral  blood) by [CONTACT_9064]/flow 
cytometry/quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
• Additional assessments related to the understanding of the mechanism of action of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab,  and obinutuzumab, e.g., assessment of 
circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) to monitor response , mechanisms of resistance to 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A , rituximab, and obinutuzumab, and/or NHL pathogenesis 
may be included. 
• Treatment and disease symptom  assessments using the M.D. Anderson Symptom 
Inventory (MDASI) 
 
3.4 SAFETY PLAN  
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study. 
Safety will be evaluated through the monitoring of the following: 
• Serious adverse events that are attributed to protocol-mandated interventions from 
the time of signing of the Informed Consent Form until the first dose of study 
treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
98/P GO27834-A2 • All adverse events from Cycle 1, Da y [ADDRESS_1051017] dose of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A , rituximab, or obinutuzumab,  whichever is later, 
including doses that were administered as part of crossover treatment 
• All serious adverse events from Cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_1051018] dose of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A , rituximab, or obinutuzumab,  whichever is later, 
including doses that were administered as part of crossover treatment 
• All serious adverse events from the last dose of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A , 
rituximab, or obinutuzumab,  whichever is later, including doses that were 
administered as part of crossover treatment, and which are judged to be caused by 
[CONTACT_766191]2980S, DCDS4501A , rituximab, or obinutuzumab , regardless of time of onset 
• Measurements of protocol-specified hem atology and clinical chemistry laboratory 
values 
• Measurements of protocol-specified vital signs 
• Assessment of ECGs 
• Assessment of physical findings on clinical physical examinations 
 
Patients who have an ongoing study drug −related adverse event will be followed until 
the event has resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_766227], new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, it is determined that the study treatment or participation is not the 
cause of the adverse event, or the study is terminated. 
See Section 5.2.3 for assessment of causality for adverse events.  
3.4.1 Safety Run-In Analysis  
As outlined in Figure 3b and Section [IP_ADDRESS], a safety run-in analysis (Cohort E) will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_514866] (IMC) to evaluate the combination of DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg with obinutuzumab.  This analysis will include data from the first [ADDRESS_1051019] cycle.  At the IMC’s discretion, and at any point during enrollment of the safety run-in, a decision could be made that more than [ADDRESS_1051020] additional doses the safety run-in for 1.8 mg/kg may be shortened to three patients. 
Safety summaries will be assessed at the safety run-in for SAEs; Grade 3-5 treatment-related AEs; all AEs; all Grade 3-5 AEs;  and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or dose modification/interruption. 
• During the 6-patient safety run-in, if any patient experiences a treatment-related 
death, then the obinutuzumab-containing portion of the study will be closed to 
further recruitment. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
99/P GO27834-A2 • During the 6-patient safety run-in: 
If [ADDRESS_1051021] 3 patients enrolled experience Grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia or serious (i.e., SAE) docume nted infection requiring IV antibiotics 
in the presence of Grade 3 −[ADDRESS_1051022] 3 patients enrolled experiences Grade 4 febrile neutropenia or 
serious (i.e., SAE) documented infection requiring IV antibiotics in the presence of Grade 3 −[ADDRESS_1051023] 3 patients experience Grade 4 febrile neutropenia or serious (i.e., SAE) infection with Grade 3 −[ADDRESS_1051024] 6 patients to be enrolled experiences Grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia or serious (i.e., SAE) docume nted infection requiring IV antibiotics 
in the presence of Grade 3 −4 neutropenia, then the obinutuzumab-containing 
portion of the study will be closed to further recruitment. 
Before the expansion portion of the study can begin (enrollment of Cohorts G 
and H), the following criteria must be met: 
Six patients must have competed enrollment in the safety run-in 
(Cohort E). 
Three patients must have completed at least 4 cycles of treatment. 
 
3.4.2 Internal Monitoring Committee  
This study will employ an Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC).  The purpose of the I MC 
will be to make recommendations regarding study conduct on the basis of trial safety 
data to ensure patient safety while receiving study treatment. 
The IMC will include a sponsor Medical Monitor not affiliated with the study, a 
Drug Safety Scientist, a biostatistician, and a statistical programmer.  Representatives from other Sponsor functional areas may be included as additional ad hoc members. In addition to the ongoing assessment of the incidence and nature of adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities by [CONTACT_82171], the IMC will review the aforementioned data at least twice during the study.  
Throughout the course of the study, the IMC will meet , as needed , at the request of the 
Medical Monitor (e.g., on the basis of unexpected safety signals).  The IMC may make recommendations regarding study conduct, including, but not limited to, performing 
additional safety analyses, amending the study protocol, holding patient enrollment to one or both treatment arms pending further safety evaluations, holding/discontinuing study treatment, or terminating the study. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
100/P GO27834-A2 Complete details of the IMC will be described in the IMC charter. 
For Arms A and B: The first planned review will occur after approximately [ADDRESS_1051025] 6 weeks follow-up.   
3.4.3 Risks Associated with  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  
The clinical safety profile of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A based on clinical data obtained in the ongoing Phase I studies are summarized in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  Known and suspected risks, based on clinical data to date, are described below.  Guidelines regarding the management of these risks through dose and schedule modifications are described in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].   
Refer also to the Investigator Brochure for complete and updated details. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-Related Events 
Some MAbs may be associated with the development of allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions, to either the active protein or excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  True allergic or anaphylactic reactions are rare after the first dose of a product, as they require prior sensitization.  Patients with true allergic or anaphylactic reactions should not receive further doses of the product.  
MAbs may also be associated with reactions that are clinically indistinguishable from true allergic or anaphylactic reactions but are mediated through direct release of cytokines or other pro-inflammatory mediator s.  Such reactions are often termed IRRs.  
IRRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_570587] a MAb product and are generally less frequent and/or less severe with subsequent infusions.  They can often be managed by [CONTACT_570664]/or pre-treatment with various medications. 
Allergic or anaphylactic reactions and IRRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_766150].  The onset of symptoms may be rapid, and some reactions may be life threatening. 
Patients should be monitored for these types of reactions during and after receiving 
DCDT2908S and DCDS4501A.  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A should be administered in an environment under close supervision of a physician and where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available.  Specific guidelines for additional precautions to be taken during and following DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A administration are provided in Sections [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
There is a potential risk of TLS if treatment with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A results in the rapid destruction of a large number of tumor cells.  If any evidence of this occurs 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
101/P GO27834-A2 during the study, TLS prophylaxis measures will be instituted.  Patients who are 
considered to have a high tumor burden (e.g., lymphocyte count ≥ 25  × 109/L) or bulky 
lymphadenopathy and who are considered to be at risk for TLS by [CONTACT_766228] (e.g., allopurinol ≥ 300 mg/day orally or a suitable alternative 
treatment according to institutional practice starting 12 −24 hours prior to study 
treatment) and must be well hydrated prior to the initiation of study treatment at Cycle 1, Day 1.  These patients should continue to receive repeated prophylaxis with allopurinol and adequate hydration prior to each subsequent infusion as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bone Marrow Toxicity/Neutropenia 
Based on preclinical toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and clinical data from the ongoing Phase I Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, neutropenia has been identified as a known risk (adverse drug reaction) of both DCDT2908S and DCDS4501A.  Neutropenia and neutropenia-associated events were reversible but in some cases resulted in protocol-mandated dose reductions and/or delays.   
Adequate hematologic function should be confirmed before initiation of study treatment.  
Patients receiving study treatment will be r egularly monitored for evidence of marrow 
toxicity with complete blood counts.  Study treatment may be delayed or modified due to 
hematologic toxicities,  as described in Section 4.3.1.  
The use of G-CSF for neutropenia is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Transfusion support 
for anemia and thrombocytopenia is also permitted at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Febrile neutropenia is commonly associated with myelotoxicity, which is considered a class effect 
of MMAE because it is commonly reported with ADCETRIS
®, other similar ADCs, and 
vincristine sulfate. 
Clinical data show that among the most common SAEs reported in both DCS4968g and 
DCT4862g studies were febrile neutropenia and pyrexia. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity 
As expected with any recombinant antibody, DCDT2980S , DCDS4501A, and 
obinutuzumab may elicit an immune response and patients may develop antibodies 
against DCDT2980S , DCDS4501A, or obinutuzumab .  Patients will be closely monitored 
for any potential immune response to DCDT2980S , DCDS4501A , and obinutuzumab .  
Appropriate screening and confirmatory assays will be employed to detect ATAs at 
multiple timepoints before, during, and after treatment with DCDT2980S , DCDS4501A, 
and obinutuzumab.  Considering the historically low immunogenicity rate of rituximab in 
NHL patients, ATAs against rituximab will not be monitored in this study. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
102/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral  Neuropathy 
On the basis of clinical data from the ongoing Phase I Studies DCT4862g and 
DCS4968g and data from brentuximab vedotin studies, an anti-CD30-vc-MMAE ADC 
(see Section 3.4.2), peripheral neuropathy  (sensory and motor)  has been identified as a 
known risk (adverse drug reaction) for both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A. 
Careful clinical evaluation of patients for neuropathy should be conducted prior to 
initiation of study drug.  Patients should be monitored for signs of peripheral neuropathy 
or worsening neuropathy and appropriate action taken per protocol guidelines.  Study treatment dose and schedule modifications for significant and prolonged neuropathic toxicity and dose-reduction are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reproductive Toxicity 
Adverse effects on human reproduction and fertility are anticipated with the administration of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, given the mechanism of action of MMAE.  Standard exclusion criteria will be used to ensure that patients of childbearing potential (male or female) are using adequate contraceptive methods.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A as well as with other ADCs using the same vc-MMAE platform.  Several 
patients given both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A had abnormal fasting blood sugar (FBS)  at screening with elevations of glucose following steroid administration prior to rituximab dose.  
Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs 
and/or initiation or adjustment of anti-hyperglycemic medications.  Emerging data suggest 
that hyperglycemia may occur more commonly in  individuals with abnormal FBS values or 
known diabetes.  This is also reported for ADCETRIS
® (2013 SmPC and 2013 USPI).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity 
Elevations in transaminase and/or bilirubin levels requiring dose modifications and 
treatment discontinuations  have been reported in the ongoing clinical studies.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Commonly Reported Side Effects  
Other commonly reported side effects of both  DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A in the Phase I clinical 
trials and within this study include fatigue, na usea, decreased appetite, vomiting, hair thinning 
or loss, joint pains, loss of appetite, diarrhea, muscle aches, constipation, increases in blood 
glucose, and headaches. 
3.4.4 Risks Associated with ADCETRIS® (Brentuximab Vedotin)  
An ADC using the same MMAE drug and linker as that used in DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A, but coupled to an antibody ta rgeting the CD30 antigen (brentuximab 
vedotin, ADCETRIS®, Seattle Genetics), was recently approved by [CONTACT_766288]-cell lymphoma.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
103/P GO27834-A2 The most common adverse reactions observed in studies with brentuximab vedotin 
(occurring in at least 20% of patients) were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, anemia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], diarrhea, pyrexia, rash, thrombocytopenia, cough, and vomiting.   
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 31% of patients receiving ADCETRIS
®.  The 
most common occurring in > 2% of patients included peripheral motor neuropathy, 
abdominal pain, septic shock, supraventricular arrhythmia, pain in extremity, and urinary 
tract infection.  In addition, John Cunningham (JC) virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death has been reported.   
Because of the use of the same MMAE drug, it is possible that the adverse events 
observed with the use of brentuximab vedotin can also be observed with the use of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.   
Refer to the current version of the ADCETRIS
® Prescribing Information for full and 
updated details. 
3.4.5 Risks Associated with Rituximab Therapy and Their 
Management  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reactions 
In single-agent clinical trials of rituximab and in post-marketing surveillance studies, mild 
to moderate infusion reactions consisting of fever and chills/rigors occurred in the majority of patients during the first rituximab infusion.  Other frequent infusion reaction signs and symptoms included nausea, pruritus, angioedema, asthenia, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, throat irritation, rhinitis, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, and hypertension.  These reactions generally occurred within 30 −[ADDRESS_1051026] infusion, and they resolved with slowing or interruption of the rituximab infusion and with supportive care (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen/paracetamol, IV saline, meperidine, and vasopressors).  The incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion and decreased with each subsequent infusion. 
Rituximab has caused severe infusion reactions.  In some cases, these reactions were 
fatal.  These severe reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_766125] a time to onset of 30 −[ADDRESS_1051027] severe manifestations and sequelae include pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, 
ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events (see Appendix D).  Approximately 80% of fatal infusion reactions occurred in association 
with the first infusion of rituximab.  Because of this, patients should receive premedication with acetaminophen/paracetamol, antihistamines, or corticosteroids, in accordance with standard clinical practice, prior to rituximab infusions. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
104/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Management of Severe Infusion Reactions 
Administration of rituximab will occur in a setting with emergency equipment and staff 
who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  The rituximab infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions on the basis of clinical judgment.   
Medications and supportive care measures ⎯including, but not limited to, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
antihistamines, glucocorticoids, IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators and 
acetaminophen/paracetamol⎯should be available for immediate use and instituted as medically indicated for use in the event of a reaction during administration.   
In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 
100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved.  Patients requiring close monitoring during all rituximab infusions include those with preexisting cardiac and pulmonary conditions, those with prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary adverse events, and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥
 25,000/μ L) with or 
without evidence of high tumor burden. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Rapid reductions in tumor volume followed by [CONTACT_22702], hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hype rphosphatemia have been reported within 
12−[ADDRESS_1051028] 
been reported in the setting of TLS following treatment with rituximab.  The risks of TLS appear to be greater in patients with high tumor burden.  Patients deemed to be at high risk for TLS complications may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive their initial dose of rituximab over 2 consecutive days (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Correction of electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function and fluid balance, and administration of supportive care, including dialysis, should be initiated as indicated.  Following complete resolution of TLS complications, rituximab has been tolerated when re-administered in conjunction with prophylactic therapy for TLS in a limited number of cases. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatitis B Reactivation with  Related Fulminant Hepatitis and 
Other Viral Infections 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported for some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of these patients received rituximab in combination with 
chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately [ADDRESS_1051029] dose of 
rituximab.  Patients with serologic findings consistent with chronic HBV (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positivity) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (HCV RNA or antibody positivity) are ineligible for this study.  Patients who are not chronically infected with HBV but have serologic evidence of prior infection at baseline (IgG hepatitis B core antibody[anti-HBc] positive but HBV DNA negative) may be eligible (if believed to be in the patient’s best interest by [CONTACT_26791]) and would be monitored closely for perturbations in liver function during the period of rituximab 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
105/P GO27834-A2 treatment and every 2 −[ADDRESS_1051030] 6 months after 
completion of rituximab therapy (Yeo et al. 2009). 
Additional serious viral infections, new, reactivated, or exacerbated (e.g., infections 
caused by [CONTACT_27912], varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, parvovirus B19, JC virus, and HCV) have been reported with rituximab, mainly in patients who had received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Particular attention should be given to patients who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment such as high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.  JC virus infection resulting in PML and death 
has been observed in rituximab-treated patients with hematologic malignancies or with autoimmune diseases.  Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of the patient’s last infusion of rituximab.  Physicians should consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations.  Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture.  Physicians should discontinue rituximab (and DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A) and consider discontinuation or reduction of any immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiovascular Events 
Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of rituximab.  Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including arrhythmias and angina, who have had recurrences of these events during rituximab therapy should be monitored throughout the infusion and the immediate post-infusion period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bowel Obstruction and Perforation 
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation, in some cases leading to death, were observed in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL.  In post-marketing reports, which include patients with low-grade or follicular NHL and patients with DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days (range, 1−77 days) in patients with documented gastrointestinal perforation.  Complaints 
of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunization 
The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied.  Patients who participate in this study may not receive either primary or booster vaccination with live virus vaccines for at least 6 months prior to initiation of rituximab or at any time during study treatment.  Investigators should review the vaccination status of potential study patients being considered for this study and follow

3.4.6 Risks Associated with Obinutuzumab Therapy  
No evidence available at the time of the app roval of this protocol indicates that special 
warnings or precautions are appropriate other than those noted in the Obinutuzumab 
Investigator’s Brochure and as described in the following sections. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-Related Reactions a nd Hypersensitivity Reactions 
(including Anaphylaxis) 
The commonly experienced IRRs have been characterized by [CONTACT_411], chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, hypotensio n, hypertension, fatigu e, and other symptoms. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_570590] -related symptoms, such as hypoxia, dyspnea, bronchospasm, 
larynx and throat irritation, and laryngeal edema, have also been reported.  These IRRs were mostly mild or moderate (NCI CTCAE v4.0, Grade 1 and 2 events), and
 < 10% of 
the events were severe (Grade 3 events), occurring predominantly during the first hour of the infusion or shortly after the first infusion had finished.  The events resolved with the slowing or interruption of the infusion and supportive care.  The incidence and severity of IRRs decreased with subsequent infusions.  Extensive tumor burden predominantly localized in the blood circulat ion (e.g., high peripheral lymphocyte count 
in patients with CLL) may be a predisposing factor for the development of IRRs. 
IRRs may be clinically indi stinguishable from IgE-mediat ed allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
TLS has been reported with obinutuzumab administration.  Patients with a high tumor 
burden, including patients with a lymphocyte count ≥ 25  × 109/L, particularly patients 
with B-cell CLL and MCL, are at increased ri sk for TLS and severe IRRs.  All patients 
with peripheral blood lymphocyte counts of ≥ 25  × 109/L or bulky adenopathy must 
receive prophylaxis for TLS prior to the initiation of study treatment.  This includes appropriate hydration, consisting of fluid intake of approx imately 3 L/day, starting 
1
−[ADDRESS_1051031] dose of obinutuzumab, and administration of allopurinol 
(300 mg/day orally) or a suitab le alternative (i.e ., rasburicase) treatment, starting at 
least [ADDRESS_1051032] infusion of obinutuzumab (Cycle 1, Day 1).  All patients should then be carefully monitored during the initial weeks of treatment.  Patients still considered at risk for TLS because of persistently high tumor burden (i.e., peripheral blood lymphocyte counts 
≥ 25  × 109/L) before the second and subsequent 
infusions of obinutuzum ab should receive continuous T LS prophylaxis with allopurinol 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
107/P GO27834-A2 or a suitable alternative (i.e., rasburicase) and adequate hydration until the risk is 
abated, as determined by [CONTACT_093].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
Cases of Grade [ADDRESS_1051033] Grade 2.  Use of G-CSF 
has been found to result in a rapid normalization of neutrophils, similar to what has been observed in patients treated with rituximab.  The use of G-CSF is allowed for treatment of neutropenia in this study.  Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is recommended according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, namely for patients who are 
≥ 60 years old and/or with co-morbidities (Lyman et al. 2004).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia 
Severe and life-threatening thrombocytopenia, including acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within 24 hours after the infusion), has been observed during treatment with obinutuzumab.  Fatal hemorrhagic events have also been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab.  It seems that the first cycle is the greatest risk of hemorrhage in patients treated with obinutuzumab.  A clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events has not been established.  Patients treated with concomitant medication, which could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia-related events (e.g., platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants), may be at greater risk of bleeding.  Patients should be closely monitored for th rombocytopenia, especially during the first 
cycle; regular laboratory tests should be performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be considered in case of severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia.  Transfusion of blood products (i.e., platelet transfusion) according to institutional practice is at the discretion of the treating physician.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infection 
On the basis of its anticipated mode of action, resulting in profound B-cell depletion, obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections.  Infections have been reported in patients receiving obinutuzumab.  Therefore, obinutuzumab should not be administered to patients with active severe infections. 
A “black-box” warning for obinutuzumab states that reactivation of hepatitis B as well 
as other serious viral infections (e.g., infections caused by [CONTACT_27912], Varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, JC virus, and HCV) that were new, reactivated, or exacerbated have been reported with the B cell
−depleting antibody rituximab mainly in 
patients who had received the drug in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic SCT.  The risk of such infections with obinutuzumab is unknown.  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
108/P GO27834-A2 Particular attention should be given to patients who have previously received 
significant immunosuppressive treatment, such as high-dose chemotherapy and SCT. 
A “black-box” warning for obinutuzumab states that JC viral infection (including 
fatal) that resulted in PML with destructive infection of oligodendrocytes of the CNS white matte have been reported in patients treated with anti-CD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including rituximab and obinutuzumab. 
The diagnosis of PML should be considered  in any patient presenting with new-onset 
neurologic manifestations.  The sympto ms of PML are unspecific and can vary 
depending on the affected region of the br ain.  Motor involvement with corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_766164], sensory involvement, cerebellar deficits, and visual field defects are 
common.  Some syndromes regarded as cort ical (e.g., aphasia or visual-spatial 
disorientation) can occur. 
Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, 
brain MRI, and lumbar puncture (cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_570591]).  
Therapy with obinutuzumab should be withheld during the investigation of potential 
PML and permanently discontinued in case of confirmed PML.  Discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should also be considered.  The patient should be referred to a neurologist for the diagnosis and management of PML. 
3.5 MINIMIZATION OF BIAS  
For the randomized, non-comparative, open-label  portion of the  study , patients were 
randomly allocated to two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio through use of an Interactive Voice and Web Response System (IXRS).  A dynamic stratified randomization scheme 
was employed to ensure balance in the stratification factors as specified in Section 3.1.   
This portion of the study (Arms A and B) is now closed to enrollment.  
3.[ADDRESS_1051034] 
Research Organization (CRO) will be utilized  to perform project management, study 
management, and clinical monitoring.  G enentech will conduct CRO oversight, approve 
patient eligibility, and perform dose escalation decision-making, medical monitoring, and statistical programming and analysis.  An IMC (see Section 3.4) will provide an additional level of safety monitoring for the study.  
Approximately 40 study centers in the [LOCATION_002], Canada, and Europe will 
participate in the study to enroll approximately 252 patients.  Additional patients may be 
enrolled in order to obtain additional safety and/or efficacy data. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
109/P GO27834-A2 Electronic data capture (EDC) will be utilized for this study.  An IXRS will be used to 
assign patient numbers.  A central laboratory will be used for sample management and storage until shipment to one of several specialty laboratories or Genentech for analysis.  An IRF will be used for the collection and possible assessment of radiographic images from tumor assessments.  Additional vendors for ECG collection and possible analysis and for PRO collection and data entry will be used. 
3.7 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the FDA regulations, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable local, state, and federal laws, as well as other applicable country laws.

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
This is an open-label study.  After written informed consent has been obtained and 
preliminary eligibility has been established, the study site will submit documentation 
supporting eligibility to the Sponsor via facsimile and obtain the Sponsor’s approval to enroll the patient.  Once the Sponsor reviews and approves the patient for enrollment, the patient number will be assigned via IXRS.  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
112/P GO27834-A2 As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], only select investigator sites that have agreed to 
participate in the non-randomized (Cohorts C and D)  portion of the study will enroll 
patients into these cohorts.  Cohorts C and D will be opened sequentially following 
completion of the randomized portion of the study for patients with FL.  
For obinutuzumab-containing cohorts (Cohorts E, G, and H), patients with either relapsed or refractory follicular  NHL or relapsed or refractory DLBCL will be enrolled.  
After the safety run-in stage for DCDS 4501A at 1.8 mg/kg in  combination with 
obinutuzumab, the patients will be enrolled into the dose-expansion portion with 40 patients in each histology group.  
Personnel responsible for performing PK and ATA assays will receive participants’ treatment assignments to identify appropriate PK and ATA samples to be analyzed in the appropriate corresponding assays.  
4.3 STUDY TREATMENT  
4.3.1 DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation and Storage 
a. DCDT2980S 
DCDT2980S will be provided as a lyophilized powder in a single-use 20-cc vial.  
The solution for reconstitution is Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI), and the reconstitution volume is 2.6 mL to yield a final concentration of 20 mg/mL DCDT2980S in 40 mM L-histidine hydrochloride, 240 mM sucrose, and 0.02% polysorbate 20, pH 6.0. 
Reconstituted DCDT2980S should be further diluted with sterile 0.9% NaCl to a total 
volume of [ADDRESS_1051041] be refrigerated at 2 °C−8°C (36°F−46°F) upon receipt until use.  
DCDT2980S should not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_242652].  Vial contents should not be frozen or shaken and should be protected from direct sunlight.  After reconstitution, DCDT2980S vials may be stored at room temperatures ( >
 8°C−25°C [> 46°F−77°F]) for up to 4 hours or at refrigerated 
temperatures (2 °C−8°C [36°F−46°F]) for up to 8 hours prior to use.  Once DCDT2980S 
has been diluted with sterile 0.9% NaCl, the solution should be used within 4 hours at room temperature or within 8 hours at refrigerated temperature.  Vials are intended for single use only; therefore, any remaining solution should be discarded. 
For further details, refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
113/P GO27834-A2 b. DCDS4501A 
DCDS4501A is provided as a liquid formulati on and contains no preservatives.  Each 
single-use 20-cc vial is filled to deliver [ADDRESS_1051042] is 
formulated as 10 mg/mL DCDS4501A in 20 mM L-histidine acetate, 240 mM sucrose, 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20, pH 5.5.  
DCDS4501A will be administered to patients intravenously via syringe pump with an 
IV infusion set containing a 0.22 −µm in-line filter with a final volume of DCDS4501A 
determined by [CONTACT_570641].  
DCDS4501A vials must be refrigerated at 2 °C−8°C (36°F−46°F) upon receipt until use.  
DCDS4501A vials may be stored at room temperature ( > 8°C−25°C [46°F −77°F]) for up 
to [ADDRESS_1051043] sunlight.  Vials are intended for single use only; therefore, any remaining solution should be discarded. 
Once the DCDS4501A dose solution has been prepared, the solution should be used 
within 4 hours at room temperature ( > 8 °C−25°C [46°F−77°F]) or within 8 hours 
refrigerated at 2°C −8°C (36°F −46°F).  Because the drug product contains no 
preservatives, the Sponsor recommends using DCDS4501A in a syringe and extension set as soon as possible to reduce the risk of microbial contamination.   
For further details, refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage and Administration 
a. DCDT2980S-Specific Information 
DCDT2980S will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_16228].  Compatibility testing has 
shown that DCDT2980S is stable when diluted in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags to a concentration at or above 0.04 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl diluent.  The drug product will be delivered following dilution in 0.9% NaCl with a final DCDT2980S concentration determined based on dose and patient weight.  The study drug will be diluted in a PVC bag and delivered using a 0.22 µm in-line filter on the IV infusion set. 
Additional information/instructions regarding study drug administration will be provided in 
the Pharmacy Binder. 
b. DCDS4501A-Specific Information 
DCDS4501A will be administered to patients intravenously via syringe pump with an 
IV infusion set containing a 0.22 µm in-line filter with a final volume of DCDS4501A determined by [CONTACT_570641].  Compatibility testing has shown that DCDS4501A is stable both in syringes made of polypropylene (PP) and in standard extension sets with 0.22 µm in-line filter, when stored neat or diluted with 0.9% NaCl saline.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
114/P GO27834-A2 Additional information/instructions regarding study drug administration will be provided in 
the Pharmacy Binder. 
c. General Information 
The total dose of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A for each patient will depend on the patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of each cycle.  The patient weight obtained during screening may be used for dose determination at all treatment cycles; if the patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of a given treatment cycle differs by >10% from the weight obtained during screening, then the new weight should be used to calculate the dose.   
For both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, the initial dose will be administered to 
well-hydrated (based on clinical judgment) patients over 90 (±
 10) minutes.  
Premedication with acetaminophen or paracetamol (e.g., 500 −1000 mg) and 
diphenhydramine (e.g., 50 °C−100 mg) per institutional standard practice may be 
administered prior to each infusion.  Administration of corticosteroids is permitted at the discretion of the treating physician.  Patients who do not receive premedications prior to the first dose of DCDT2980S and who develop an IRR during the first dose should receive premedications prior to  subsequent doses (see Table 1). 
The DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A infusion may be slowed or interrupted for patients experiencing infusion-associated symptoms.  Following the initial dose, patients will be observed for 90 minutes for fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, nausea, or other infusion-associated symptoms.  If the infusion is well-tolerated, subsequent doses of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A may be administered over 30 ( ±
 10) minutes, followed by a 
30-minute observation period post-infusion.   
For instructions on study drug preparation and administration, refer to the DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification 
Patients should be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to each dose using the 
NCI CTCAE v4.0 grading scale.  Dosing will occur only if a patient’s clinical assessment and laboratory test values are acceptable.  If scheduled dosing coincides with a holiday that precludes dosing, dosing should commence on the nearest following date, with subsequent dosing continuing on a 21-day schedule as applicable. 
Specific guidelines around dosage modifications for neutropenia and peripheral 
neuropathy are detailed below in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  Patients who experience other treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity
 or laboratory abnormalities  will be allowed 
to delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab  or obinutuzumab ) for up to 
2 weeks to allow for recovery.  Patients may continue to receive additional infusions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A per their treatment assignment provided that the toxicity has resolved to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of the baseline value, whichever is lower, within the 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
115/P GO27834-A2 2−week delay period.  Upon resolution, the dose for subsequent infusions may be 
reduced to 1.8 mg/kg  (in Cohorts C and D) .  If the toxicity that resulted in the dose 
reduction persists or recurs at the reduced dose, then the patient should be discontinued 
from study treatment.  The decision for dose modification will be made on the basis of the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continued study treatment and in consultation with the Medical Monitor.   
Once dose reductions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A are made for toxicity, dose 
re-escalation will not be allowed.  Patients who are enrolled in the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and D), are dosed at an ADC dose of 1.8 mg/kg, and have progressive disease in the absence of any drug-related toxicity may have their 
ADC dose increased to 2.4 mg/kg if it is felt that there is reasonable justification for ongoing clinical benefit.  The decision to increase the dose must be made in consultation 
with and approval of the Medical Monitor.   Patients in Cohorts E, G, and H 
(obinutuzumab-containing cohorts) will not be eligible for dose escalation.  
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to DCDT2980S or DCDS4501 A, requiring its 
discontinuation, single-agent rituximab may be continued on the basis of the 
investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit and with the approval of the Medical 
Monitor.   Patients enrolled in obinutuzumab-containing cohorts will not continue on 
single-agent obinutuzumab unless approved by [CONTACT_1689].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved to Grade ≤ 2 or ≥ 80% of baseline value, 
whichever is lower, may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  Dosing of both DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab should be held during 
this period.  If all study drug −related toxicities have resolved sufficiently, the patient may 
resume DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab dosing on the 
regular every-21-day schedule.   
A patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_570667] a patient’s dosing regimen from 21-day to 28-day cycles would provide 
sufficient time for recovery from a transient and reversible toxicity ⎯for example, 
cytopenia without requiring repeated treatment delays.  Modifications to the dosing 
schedule in this fashion must be made in consultation with and with the approval of the Medical Monitor. 
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for continuation of dosing after the 2-week delay 
may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes (see Section 4.5.6).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
116/P GO27834-A2 Specific guidelines around schedule modifications for neutropenia and peripheral 
neuropathy are detailed below in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reaction 
Patients will be monitored during and after each DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A infusion for [ADDRESS_1051044] infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions in the absence of infusion-related adverse events.  Patients who experience infusion-related symptoms should be managed as described in Table 1.  Precautions for suspected anaphylactic reaction during study drug infusions are provided in Appendix D. 
In the event of a life-threatening IRR, which may include pulmonary or cardiac events, or 
an IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction, administration of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be immediately discontinued.  Patients who experience these reactions should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment and are not eligible to receive any additional study treatment. 
Premedication prior to DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A with acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
antihistamines, or corticosteroids per standard clinical practice is permitted⎯for example, in patients with substantial tumor burden and where the risk of cytokine release syndrome is high.  In patients who do not receive premedication prior to any given dose of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A and who develop any Grade ≥
 2 
infusion-related toxicity, premedication should be administered prior to subsequent doses.

antihistamine such as diphenhydramine if they  have not been received in the last 4 hours.  
IV saline may be indicated.  For bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, patients may require 
antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids (e .g., 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent), 
and/or bronchodilators.  Patients with hypotens ion requiring vasopressor support must be 
permanently discontinued from study drug. 
c Infusion rate escalation after re-initiation:  Upon complete resolution of symptoms, the infusion 
may be resumed at 50% of the rate achieved prior to interruption.  In the absence of 
infusion-related symptoms, the rate of infusion ma y be escalated in increments of 50 mg/hr every 
30 minutes.

118/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
Because neutropenia is a known risk of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the use of growth factor support (G-CSF) as prophylactic and therapeutic indications is permitted (see Appendi x F) in order to allow continued dosing 
of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A.  Dose modifications for patients who experience treatment-related Grade 3− 4 neutropenia in the context of G-CSF usage are as follows: 
• Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF (i.e., prior to the first dose of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A) is permitted for patients with clinical factors listed in 
Appendix F or who otherwise are considered at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_766128]. 
• Patients who experience treatment-related Grade 3− 4 neutropenia will be allowed to 
delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab  or obinutuzumab ) for up 
to two weeks to allow for recovery.  Therapeutic G-CSF is permitted as clinically 
indicated (see Appendix F) and to facilitate neutrophil recovery to allow subsequent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dosing. 
• Subsequent dosing of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A and rituximab/obinutuzumab is 
permitted provided that the neutropenia has resolved to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of the 
baseline value, whichever is lower, within the 2-week period.   
• If prophylactic G-CSF was not administered prior to the cycle in which the 
Grade 3− 4 neutropenia developed, then prophylactic G-CSF may be administered 
prior to subsequent cycles without DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose reduction.  The 
dose schedule may be changed from 21-day to 28-day cycles to provide sufficient time for neutrophil recovery in subsequent cycles.  In the absence of prophylactic 
G-CSF or dose schedule modification, the dose of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A in 
subsequent cycles should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.   For Cohorts E, G, and H, 
patients will be given DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg, and further dose 
reductions cannot be made .   
• If Grade 3− 4 neutropenia recurs with prophylactic G-CSF, the dose for subsequent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.  Prophylactic G-CSF 
and dose schedule modifications as described above are permitted in order to maintain the reduced DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose level and schedule. 
• If Grade 3− 4 neutropenia recurs at the reduced dose despi[INVESTIGATOR_766151] G-CSF, then the patient should be discontinued from study treatment.   
• For patients enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C 
and D , as well as Cohorts E, G, and H ), dose modifications will not be allowed.  
Administration of therapeutic/prophylactic G-CSF and dose-schedule modifications as described above are allowed.  Patients who have persistent or recurrent Grade 3− 4 neutropenia as defined above should be discontinued from study 
treatment. 
 
The determination of the dose and schedule modifications will be made on the basis of 
the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continuing study treatment and with the approval of the Medical Monitor.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
119/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral  Neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy  (sensory or motor)  is a known risk of DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  For new or worsening drug-related Grade 2 or 3 
peripheral sensory and/or motor neuropathy, dosing should be held for up to 2 weeks 
until peripheral neuropathy  (sensory or motor)  improves to Grade 1 or baseline grade.  
Continuation of study treatment followi ng dose delays beyond 2 weeks will require 
consultation with and approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment of the 
benefit-risk analysis of continuing to delay study treatment. 
Following resolution of peripheral  neuropathy  (sensory and/or motor), subsequent doses 
of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.  DCDS4501A should not 
be reduced to a dose lower than 1.8 mg/kg.   If worsening Grade 2 or 3 peripheral  
neuropathy (sensory and/or motor)  recurs following dose reduction, study treatment 
should be discontinued.  For Grade 3  peripheral  neuropathy  (sensory and/or motor) , 
study treatment should be discontinued.  
For patients enrolled into the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and D), 
dose modifications will not be allowed.  Patients who have Grade 2 or 3 peripheral 
neuropathy  (sensory and/or motor),  as defined above , should be discontinued from 
study treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A as well as with other ADCs using the same vc-MMAE platform.  Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs and/or initiation of improved anti-hyperglyce mic medications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
For symptomatic fasting Grade 3 ( >
 250− 500 mg/dL) or asymptomatic Grade 4 
(> 500 mg/dL) hyperglycemia, medical management  should be initiated immediately and 
consultation with a specialist should be considered.  If the hyperglycemia persists for >
 1 week after initiation of management, dose modification, schedule modification, or 
discontinuation of study treatment should be considered.  In these cases, the study 
Medical Monitor should be consulted to assess the benefit-risk balance of continued study treatment. 
4.3.2 Rituximab  
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation 
Rituximab (Rituxan®/MabThera®) is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid 
concentrate for IV administration.  Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in 500-mg (50-mL) single-use vials.  A single-unit, 500-mg carton contains one 50-mL vial of rituximab (10 mg/mL).  The product is formulated for IV administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL s odium citrate dihydrate, and 0.7 mg/mL 
polysorbate 80, after reconstitution with SWFI.  The pH is adjusted to 6.5.  Vials are for 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
120/P GO27834-A2 single use.  Each vial and carton will contain a label (either single-panel or booklet) 
affixed to the vial or carton.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, Admini stration, and Storage 
Rituximab (Rituxan®, MabThera®) will be administered intravenously once per 3-week 
(or 4-week) cycle.  The infusion at 375 mg/m2 for each dose will be based on the 
patient’s body surface area at screening and will remain the same throughout the study.   
If a scheduled dose of rituximab falls outside of the ±  2-day window for reasons other 
than an adverse event, the site must notify and have a discussion with the Genentech 
Medical Monitor prior to rituximab administ ration.  Such dosing may not necessarily 
qualify as a protocol deviation, if deemed to be in the best interests of the patient, after consultation with the Medical Monitor and agreed to in advance by [CONTACT_1689].  
Rituximab should not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  Infusion reactions may 
occur.  Premedication consisting of acetaminophen (or paracetamol), diphenhydramine (or other suitable antihistamine), and a single dose of hydrocortisone (e.g., up to 100 mg or an equivalent dose of methylprednisolone) may also be administered beginning with the first infusion, per standard clinical practice.  Premedication may attenuate infusion reactions.  Because transient hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding antihypertensive medications for [ADDRESS_1051048] Infusion 
The rituximab solution for infusion should be administered intravenously at an initial rate of 50 mg/hr.  Rituximab should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs.  If infusion reactions do not occur, the infusion rate should be escalated in 50 −mg/hr increments 
every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted.  The infusion can continue at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of patient symptoms.   
b. Subsequent Infusions 
If the patient tolerates the first infusion well, subsequent rituximab infusions may be administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr and increased in 100 −mg/hr increments at 
30-minute intervals to a maximum of 400 mg/hr, as tolerated.  If the patient does not tolerate the first infusion well, the guidelines for the first infusion should be followed. 
If a patient tolerates the first three cycles of study treatment without significant infusion 
reactions, rituximab may be administered as “rapid infusion” in accordance with local institutional guidelines. 
c. Storage 
Rituximab vials must be stored at 2 °C−8°C (36°C−46°F).  Rituximab vials should be 
stored in the outer carton in order to protect them from light.  Rituximab solution for 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
121/P GO27834-A2 infusion may be stored at 2 °C−8°C (36°C−46°F) for 24 hours and has been shown to be 
stable for an additional 12 hours at room temperature.  However, because rituximab 
does not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be stored refrigerated (2°C−8°C).  No incompatibilities between rituximab and PVC or polyethylene (PE) bags 
have been observed. 
See the Rituxan
® (Rituximab) Package Insert or SmPC (in the European Union) for 
additional information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification 
There will be no rituximab dose modification in this study.  Patients at high risk for 
TLS complications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive their initial dose of rituximab over 2 consecutive days (e.g., 125 mg/m
2 on Day 1, 
250 mg/m2 on Day 2; with DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose potentially delayed to Day 3). 
Any NCI CTCAE (v4.0) toxicity Grade ≥ 3 in severity that is deemed related to rituximab 
treatment will require interruption of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab) until resolution to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of baseline, whichever is lower.  Resumption of 
rituximab treatment may be considered in patients with resolution of toxicities to Grade ≤
 1 within 2 weeks at the discretion of the investigator, after consultation with the 
Medical Monitor.  Failure of such toxiciti es to resolve after 2-week delay in study 
treatment will require permanent discontinuation of rituximab.  Continuation of rituximab 
treatment may be permitted on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].   
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to rituximab requiring its discontinuation, 
single-agent DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be continued on the basis of the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit and with the approval of the Medical Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved (i.e., to Grade ≤  1 or ≥  80% of baseline) 
may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  If after the up to −2-week 
delay, all study drug −related toxicities have resolved sufficiently, the patient may receive 
the scheduled doses of rituximab.  In addition, a patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_766233] a patient’s dosing regimen from 21-day to  28-day cycles would provide sufficient time for recovery 
from transient cytopenias without requiring repeated treatment delays. 
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for dosing after the additional [ADDRESS_1051049] 
elapsed may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes (see Section 4.5.1).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by 
 
[CONTACT_1738]:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
122/P GO27834-A2 the investigator and approval from the Medical Monitor.  In addition, delay of therapy 
because of toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation and will be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reaction 
Patients will be monitored during and after each rituximab infusion for [ADDRESS_1051050] infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions in the absence of infusion-related adverse events.  Patients who experience infusion-related symptoms should be managed as directed in Table 1 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
In the event of a life-threatening IRR (which may include pulmonary or cardiac events) or 
IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction to rituximab, rituximab should be discontinued and no additional rituximab should be administered.  Patients who experience these reactions should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment and should be discontinued from study treatment. 
4.3.3 Obinutuzumab  
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation 
Obinutuzumab (GA101/Gazyva ™/Gazyvaro) is a clear, colorless to slightly brownish 
liquid, provided as a single  1000-mg dose liquid concentr ate with a strength of 
25 mg/mL.  It is supplied in 50 −mL glass vials containing 40 mL of the 25 mg/mL 
liquid concentrate.  In addition to the antibody, the liquid also contains histidine/histidine-HCl, trehalose, poloxamer 188, and highly purified water (HPW). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, Administration and Storage 
Obinutuzumab will be administered by [CONTACT_766303] (flat) dose of 
1000 mg in combination wi th DCDS4501A, as outlined in Section 3.1.3.  
Obinutuzumab will be administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2
−8 (see Table 2).  No do se modifications of obinutuzumab are allowed. 
All obinutuzumab infusions should be administered after premedication with oral acetaminophen and an antihi stamine (see Section 4.4.1).  The prophylactic use of 
corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent) may also be considered for patients thought to be at high risk for IRRs, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093], and should be administered prior to the obinutuzumab infusion.  On Cycle [ADDRESS_1051051] 
60 minutes prior to the obinutuzumab infusion.  Premedication with prednisone or prednisolone is mandatory in patients who had an IRR and should continue until IRRs no longer occur during antibody infusion.  For the management of IRRs and anaphylaxis, see Table 1 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
If it is the strong preference of the investigator or of the site (e.g., for logistical reasons) or if the patient is at increased risk for an IRR (high tumor burden, high peripheral 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
123/P GO27834-A2 lymphocyte count), the administration of obinutuzumab infusion can be split over 
[ADDRESS_1051052] Infusion (Cycle 1 Day 1) Subsequent Infusions 
• Begin infusion at an initial rate of 
50 mg/hr. 
• If no infusion-related or hypersensitivity reaction occurs, increase the infusion rate in 50-mg/hour increments every 30 minutes to 
a maximum of 400 mg/hr. 
• If a reaction develops, stop or slow the 
infusion.  Administer medications and supportive care in accordance with institutional guidelines.  If reaction has resolved, resume the infusion at a 50% reduction in rate (i.e., 50% of rate used
 
at the time the reaction occurred).  • If the patient experienced an 
infusion-related or hypersensitivity reaction 
during the prior infusion, use full premedication including 100 mg prednisone/prednisolone (until no further IRR occurs), begin infusion at an initial rate of 50 mg/hr, and follow instructions for 
first infusion. 
• If the patient tolerate d the prior infusion 
well (defined by [CONTACT_570644] 2 
reactions during a final infusion rate of 
≥ 100 mg/hr), begin infusion at a rate of 
100 mg/hr. 
• If no reaction occurs, increase the infusion rate in 100-mg/hour increments every 
30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. 
• If a reaction develops, stop or slow the 
infusion.  Administer medications and supportive care in accordance with institutional guidelines.  If reaction has resolved, resume the infusion at a 50% reduction in rate (i.e., 50% of rate used
 
at the time the reaction occurred).  
IRR  = infusion-related reaction.  
In all parts of the study, obinutuzumab must be administered in a clinical (inpatient or 
outpatient) setting.  Full emergency resuscitation facilities should be immediately available, and patients should be under the close supervision of the investigator at all times.  For the management of IRRs and anaphylaxis, see Table 1 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Obinutuzumab should be administered as a slow IV infusion through a dedicated line.  IV infusion pumps should be used to control the infusion rate of obinutuzumab.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus.  Ad ministration sets with PVC, polyurethane 
(PUR), or PE as a product contact [CONTACT_26778] (PO), polypropylene (PP), PVC, or PE as a product contact [CONTACT_570642].  Do not use an additional in-line filter because of potential adsorption. 
The recommended storage conditions for obinutuzumab drug product are between 2°C 
and 8°C, protected from light.  For clinic al formulation-specific and batch-specific 
instructions and information on in-use stability, see the packaging label.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
124/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification 
There will be no obinutuzumab dose modificatio n in this study.  Patients at high risk 
for TLS complications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive 
obinutuzumab over 2 consecutive days (with DCDS4501A dose potentially delayed to Day 2 or Day 3). 
Any NCI CTCAE (v4.0) toxicity Grade 
≥ 3 in severity that is deemed related to 
obinutuzumab treatment will require in terruption of study treatment (both 
DCDS4501A and obinutuzumab) un til resolution to Grade ≤ 2 or ≥ 80% of baseline, 
whichever is lower.  Resumption of obinutuzumab treatment may be considered in 
patients with resolution of toxicities to Grade ≤ 1 within 2 weeks at the discretion of the 
investigator, after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  Failure of such toxicities to resolve after 2-week delay in study treatment will require permanent discontinuation of obinutuzumab.  Continuation of study treatment following dose delays beyond 2 weeks will require consultation with and approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment of the benefit-risk analysis of continuing to delay study treatment.  
If a patient develops una cceptable toxicity to obinutuzumab requiring its 
discontinuation, single-agent DC DS4501A will not be  permitted.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved (i.e., to Grade ≤ 1 or ≥ 80% of baseline) 
may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  Dosing of both DCDS4501A 
and obinutuzumab should be held during this period.  If all study drug −related 
toxicities have resolved to Grade  ≤ 1 or ≥ 80% of baseline, the patient may resume 
DCDS4501A and obinutuzumab do sing on the regular every −21−day schedule.  In 
addition, a patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_766304] a patient’s dosing regimen from 21-day to 28-day cycles would provide sufficient time for recovery from transient cytopenias without requiring repeated treatment delays. 
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for dosing after the additional [ADDRESS_1051053] 
elapsed may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes (see Section 4.5.6).  Exceptions on the basi s of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed 
following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].  In addition, delay of therapy because of toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation and will be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
Specific guidelines around schedule mod ifications for thrombocytopenia are detailed 
below in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
125/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia is a known risk of obinutuzumab (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  If the clinical 
condition of a patient requires the use of concomitant anticoagulants, the patient is at increased risk of bleeding when the platelet count is 
< 20,000/μL.  When possible, 
replace prior therapy with Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) before Cycle 1 Day 1.  Clinical decision making may be adjusted depending on the patient-specific assessment of benefit and risk. 
In the event of severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count 
< 10,000/μL) and/or 
symptomatic bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who are not receiving 
concomitant anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors: 
• Hold obinutuzumab until thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding resolves, but 
do not skip any doses of obinutuzumab for the sake of maintaining the study 
treatment schedule. 
 
In the event of thrombocytopenia with platelet count < 20,000/μL and/or symptomatic 
bleeding (irrespective of platelet count) in patients who are receiving concomitant 
anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors: 
• Hold obinutuzumab until thrombocytopenia or symptomatic bleeding resolves, but 
do not skip any doses of obinutuzumab for the sake of maintaining the study 
treatment schedule. 
• For patients who are on LMWH or NOACs, when platelet count < 20,000/μL 
develops, reduce the dose of LMWH or NOACs used. 
• For patients who are on platelet inhibitors when thrombocytopenia with platelet 
count < 20,000/μL develops, consideration should be given to temp orarily pausing 
the use of platelet inhibitors.

126/P GO27834-A2 4.4 CONCOMITANT AND EXCLUDED THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_5165]  
4.4.1 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs,  over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements)  used by a patient 
from 7 days prior to  the screening evaluation to the end of study visits.  All concomitant 
medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the appropriate 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, or other maintenance therapy should continue their use.  Concomitant use of hematopoietic growth factors is allowed in accordance with instructions provided in the package inserts. 
Patients who experience infusion-related temperature elevations of >
 38.5°C (> 101.3°F) 
or other minor infusion-related symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen/paracetamol ( ≥ 500 mg) and/or H1 and H2 histamine-receptor 
antagonists (e.g., diphenhydramine, ranitidine).  Serious infusion-related events manifested by [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, wheez ing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced 
oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_766130] (e.g., supplemental oxygen, β2-agonists, and/or corticosteroids) as clinically 
indicated according to standard clinical practice (see Table 1).   
For patients enrolled on obinutuzumab-containing regimens, it is recommended that 
oral prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone be given as premedication within [ADDRESS_1051055] obinutuzumab infusion, additional glucocorticoids are allowed at the investigator’s discretion.  For patients who did not experience infusion-related symptoms with their previous infusion, premedication at subsequent infusions may be omitted at the investigator’s discretion. 
Infusion reaction prophylaxis with medications (e.g., acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids) may be instituted at any point in the study if it is determined to be in the best interest of the patient on the basis of the observation of IRRs in patients already enrolled in the study.  Patients with Grade [ADDRESS_1051056] be premedicated prior to retreatment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Patients with hypotension requiring vasopressor support or with Grade [ADDRESS_1051057] be permanently discontinued from study treatment. 
4.4.2 Excluded Therapy  
Use of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_27789]:

• Radiotherapy • Immunotherapy including immunosuppressive therapy 
• Radioimmunotherapy 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
127/P GO27834-A2 • Hormone therapy (other than contracept ives, hormone-replacement therapy, or 
megestrol acetate) 
• Biologic agents (other than hematopoietic growth factors, which are allowed 
if clinically indicated and used in accordance with instructions provided in the 
package inserts); guidelines for the use of G-CSF are detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
and Appendix F. 
• Any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766131], whether 
approved by [CONTACT_766289].  Patients who are discontinued from study treatment will be followed for safety 
outcomes for 30 days following the patient’s last dose of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A or 
rituximab or obinutuzumab , whichever is later, or until the patient receives another 
anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. 
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
4.5.1 Definitions of Study Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical Hist ory and Demographics 
Medical history includes all clinically signifi cant diseases, prior cancer history, prior 
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649], and all medications used by [CONTACT_25701] 7 days 
preceding the screening visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a sitting or semi-supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], pulse oximetry, pulse rate, and body temperature.  Every effort will be made to ensure that vital signs are obtained from patients in a consistent manner and position.  The timing of vital sign collection on the days of study treatment administration is as follows: 
• For the administration of rituximab  or obinutuzumab, vital signs should be assessed 
prior to the start of the infusion, every 15 ( ±
 5) minutes during the first hour of the 
infusion, as clinically indicated during the remainder of the infusion, and following 
the completion of the infusion.  
• For the administration of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A, vital signs should be assessed 
prior to the start of the infusion, every 15 ( ± 5) minutes during the infusion, at the end 
of the infusion, and every 30 ( ± 10) minutes for [ADDRESS_1051058]-infusion following 
dosing at Cycle 1 and 30 ( ± 10) minutes following dosing in subsequent cycles.  
Additional monitoring of vital signs should be performed if clinically indicated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination should inclu de the evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.

[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram Assessments 
Twelve-lead digital ECG measurements will be obtained in triplicate, with immediately 
consecutive ECGs obtained until three evaluable ECGs are recorded, at the following timepoints: 
• Screening 
• 30− 60 minutes before the start of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in Cycle 1 
• 30− 60 minutes after the completion of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in 
Cycle 1 
• 30− 60 minutes after the completion of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in 
Cycle 3 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
130/P GO27834-A2 • Day 8 ( ± 1 day) of Cycle 3 time matched (i.e., obtained at the same time of day) with 
post-DCDT2980s/DCDS4501A infusion ECGs for Cycle 3  only for 
rituximab-containing arms/cohorts 
• Treatment completion/early termination visit 
 
Non-triplicate ECGs should also be performed when clinically indicated in any patient 
with evidence of or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_766152].  
All ECGs as described above will be submitted to a Sponsor-designated ECG central 
laboratory for storage and potential analysis.  Detailed instructions on ECG acquisitions and transmissions to the ECG central laboratory will be provided in the ECG manual provided for this study. 
Representative ECGs at each timepoint should be reviewed by [CONTACT_1720] a 
qualified designee.  Post-screening ECG measurements should be obtained as close as possible to scheduled serum and plasma PK samples (see Appendices B-1 and B-2) and should be no more than 30 minutes apart.  If QTc prolongation ( >
 500 ms and 
> 60 ms longer than the pre-dose baseline value) is noted, ECGs should be repeated 
until the prolongation is reversed or stabilized.  If a PK sample is not scheduled at the timepoint where QTc prolongation is first observed, then an unscheduled sample should be obtained.  An evaluation for potential causes of QT prolongation ⎯for 
example, electrolyte imbalances or concomitant medications ⎯should be performed, 
study treatment dosing held, and the Medical Monitor notified.  Management of QT/QTc prolongation should be performed in accordance with institutional standard of care at the discretion of the treating physician. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
Pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  will be characterized by [CONTACT_766237] (conjugated and unconjugated antibody), acMMAE, and free MMAE concentrations using validated methods (see Section 4.9).  Plasma samples may also be analyzed for other potential MMAE-containing catabolites, per sponsor’s discretion.  Pharmacokinetics of rituximab will be characterized by [CONTACT_766238] a validated method (see Section 4.9).  Pharmacokinetics of 
obinutuzumab will be characterized by [CONTACT_766305] a validated method  (see Section 4.9).  These assessments will allow for further 
characterization of pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, the assessment 
of the drug interaction potential when they are given in combination with rituximab or 
obinutuzumab , and the investigation of potential correlations between PK parameters 
and safety and/or activity if data allow and at the sponsor’s discretion.  
Pharmacodynamics of obinutuzumab and DCS4501A may be assessed by [CONTACT_766240].  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
131/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity Assessments 
The immunogenicity evaluation will utilize a risk-based strategy and tiered approach 
(Rosenberg and Worobec 2004a, 2004b, 2005; Koren et al. 2008) designed to detect and characterize all ATA responses to DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  Patient samples will first be screened to detect all antibody responses toward DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A.  Samples that screen positive will be analyzed in a confirmatory assay (competitive binding with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A) to assess the specificity of the positive response.  Titers will be determined for confirmed positive samples.  Further characterization will be assessed by [CONTACT_766293]2980S or DCDS4501A to characterize whether the ATA responses are primarily to the mAb or the linker-drug regions of the ADC.  Positive ATA samples will be stored for further characterization of ATA responses, if necessary.   
The schedule of sample collection for ATA assessment is outlined in Appendices B-[ADDRESS_1051060] all antibody responses to 
obinutuzumab.  Samples that screen positive will be analyzed in a confirmatory assay (competitive binding with obinutuzumab) to assess the specificity of the positive response.  The relative levels of ATA in confirmed positive samples will be determined in a titering assay.  Positive ATA samples w ill be stored for further characterization of 
ATA responses, if necessary. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Response Assessments 
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and re-assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response assessments will be assessed by [CONTACT_1275], on the basis of physical examinations, CT scans, PET scans, and/or MRI 
scans, and bone marrow examinations, using standard response criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007) (see Appendix C -1 and C-2 ). 
a. Radiographic Assessments for Patients on Ri tuximab-Containing 
Arms/Cohorts  
CT scans with contrast should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis scans; CT scans of 
the neck should be performed at screening and followed only if disease is present at screening.   Post-screening radiographic assessments may be limited to areas of prior involvement only if required by [CONTACT_72952]. 
MRI scans may be used instead of CT scans in patients for whom CT scans with IV 
contrast are contraindicated.  Details regarding imaging procedures in these cases will be provided in the Imaging Manual. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
132/P GO27834-A2 An 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose− positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) (hereafter 
referred to as PET) scan is required during screening for all patients with DLBCL.  An 
additional PET scan in DLBCL patients should be obtained at the 6-month tumor assessment to ensure consistency of response assessment methodology at this timepoint for all patients.  PET scans should additionally be obtained to confirm disappearance of metabolically active disease during study treatment and to confirm a CR upon discontinuation of study treatment.   
For patients with FL, PET scans are not required but may be obtained on the basis of 
physician preference and if permitted by [CONTACT_72952].  Similarly, for DLBCL, PET scans on patients with FL should be obtained during screening; for patients whose tumors are PET positive during screening, an additional PET scan should be obtained at the 6-month tumor assessment.  PET scans should additionally be obtained to confirm disappearance of metabolically active disease during study treatment and to confirm a CR upon discontinuation of study treatment.  
For all patients regardless of disease subtype, combined PET-CT scans may be used 
instead of CT alone if performed with contrast and if collected with resolution sufficient to allow accurate and consistent comparison of target lesion measurements with subsequent PET-CT scans.  If a PET-CT scan is to be used during screening, then PET-CT scans should be performed for all subsequent tumor assessments in order to ensure their consistency across different timepoints. 
All tumor assessments will be submitted to an IRF for storage and possible independent 
centralized review.  Details related to submission of data to the IRF will be defined in a separate Imaging Manual. 
b. Radiographic Assessments for Patients on Obinutuzumab-Containing 
Cohorts 
PET scans should minimally extend from skul l-base to mid-thigh.  Full-body PET scan 
should be performed when clinically appropriate. 
CT scans with oral and IV contrast should include chest, abdomen, and pelvic scans; 
CT scans of the neck should be included if clinically indicated.  CT scans for response assessment may be limited to areas of prior involvement only if required by [CONTACT_72952].  At the investigator’s discretion, CT scans may be repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected. 
In patients for whom contrast is contraindicated
⎯for example, patients with contrast 
allergy or impaired renal CL ⎯CT or combined PET/CT scans without contrast are 
permitted so long as they permit consistent and precise measurement of target lesions 
during the study treatment period.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
133/P GO27834-A2 PET and CT scans are required for follicular  NHL and DLBCL patients at screening, 
after Cycle 4 of study treatment (i.e., be tween Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1), and 
at EOT.  The EOT response assessment should be performed 6 −[ADDRESS_1051061] response criteria for NHL (see Appendix C-2).   
c. Bone Marrow Assessments 
A bone marrow biopsy for morphology is required at screening and should reflect disease status in the bone marrow following documented relapse on the last prior therapy or within 3 months of Day 1, whichever occurs later.  If the bone marrow biopsy at screening demonstrates presence of tumor cells, a subsequent bone marrow examination is required only to confirm a CR or if clinically indicated.  If the bone marrow biopsy at screening does not demonstrate presence of tumor cells, then subsequent bone marrow examination is required only if clinically indicated. 
d. Schedule of Tumor Response Assessments for Rituximab-Containing 
Arms/Cohorts  
Tumor response assessments will be performed every 3 months ( ± 1 week) from the 
initiation of study treatment until study treatment completion or early termination (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1051062] 
eight 21-day cycles of treatment).  The schedule of tumor assessments is independent 
of the study treatment dose schedule.  For patients enrolled on rituximab-containing 
arms/cohorts, the schedule of tumor response assessments is detailed in Appendix A-1.  As stated above, for all DLBCL patients  enrolled on a rituximab-containing arm/cohort , 
PET scans are required during the screening period and at the 6-month tumor assessment timepoint. 
The schedule for tumor response assessments for patients who proceed to crossover 
treatment is detailed in Appendix A-2.   
Additional response assessments, after the final dose of study treatment, for patients 
who discontinue from study treatment (either initial or crossover treatment) for reasons 
other than progressive disease, will be performed as described in Appendix A- 4.  
Tumor assessments should also be performed within [ADDRESS_1051063] study drug 
infusion (both initial and crossover treatment) at the treatment completion/early termination visit.  Imaging scans are not required at the treatment completion/early termination visit if scans have been performed wi thin the previous [ADDRESS_1051064] be performed.   
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
134/P GO27834-A2 e. Schedule of Tumor Response Assessm ents for Obinutuzumab-Containing 
Cohorts 
All follicular NHL and DLBCL patients enrolled in obinutuzumab-containing cohorts 
are required to have a combined PET and CT scan at screening, after Cycle 4 of treatment, and at EOT.  The schedule for tumor response assessments for patients enrolled on obinutuzumab-containing cohorts is detailed in Appendix A-3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Explor atory Research 
a. Tumor Tissue Samples 
Required Tumor Tissue Samples  
Tumor tissue samples will be used for central pathologic laboratory review of CD20, 
CD22, and CD79b expression.  Additional studies to fulfill the exploratory objectives in Section 3.3.4 will be performed, including, but not limited, to the following: 
• Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling for signatures of NHL biology, 
including prognostic subpopulations (Alizadeh et al. 2000; Wright et al. 2003), target 
expression (CD20, CD22 and CD79b), and apoptotic response  
• Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from cores taken from provided blocks for 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assessments  
for biomarker endpoints involved in response to chemotherapy including quantitation 
of Bcl-2 protein and genetic alterations of bcl-2 including gene rearrangements, amplifications, and t(14;18) translocations. Additional IHC markers may include 
those related to the tumor microenvironment. 
• Tumor DNA to assess mutations that have been shown to be associated with NHL 
biology and activation of the B-cell receptor, including mutations in CD79b (Pasqualucci et al. 2011) 
 
For patients who develop progressive disease and are eligible to receive crossover 
treatment (see Section 3.1.8), a biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease will be performed.  Tumor tissue samples obtained at this timepoint will be used to assess changes in biology, target expression, and regulators of apoptosis as described above, which have occurred and may be linked to progression on initial study treatment. 
Optional Tumor Tissue Samples (Requires Optional Research Informed 
Consent  
For patients who provide informed consent, an optional tumor biopsy will be collected at time of progression from the following patients: 
• Patients who develop disease progression following initial study treatment and do 
not proceed to receive crossover treatment 
• Patients who develop disease progression on crossover treatment 
 
Tumor tissue samples obtained at these timepoints will be used to assess changes in 
biology, target expression, and regulators of  apoptosis, as described above, that have 
occurred and may be linked to progression on treatment. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
135/P GO27834-A2 b. Blood and Plasma Samples 
A plasma sample will be collected prior to treatment. 
Blood samples will be taken aligned with PK sampling to assess the pharmacodynamics 
response by [CONTACT_766244].  
For patients who sign the Optional Research Informed Consent, an additional blood 
sample will also be taken prior to treatment. 
The plasma and blood samples may be used for the assessment of specific tumor 
biologic markers, including proteins, circulating DNA, and microRNAs.  The information obtained from these samples will enable a better understanding of the biology of NHL and disease prognosis, identify potential predictors of response to treatment with 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A, rituximab,  and/or obinutuzumab , improve diagnostic 
assessments, and identify and characterize mechanisms of resistance to DCDT2980S or 
DCDS4501A and rituximab or obinutuzumab activity.   
Because tumorigenesis is a multiple-step process linked to somatic events, any DNA 
analysis will focus on sporadic mutations specifically found in tumor tissue and not on inherited changes found in the whole body.  For this purpose, some tumor-containing sections may be taken from the tissue block and used for the DNA extraction process.  Assays on stored tissue samples may be performed at Genentech or at a central specialty laboratory.

proportions for categorical variables.  All summaries will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_1570], assigned dose level, and disease-specific cohort. 
Study drug administration data will be listed by [CONTACT_90050]-specific cohorts described in 
Sections 3.1.[ADDRESS_1051083] udy site, patient number, treatment group, 
disease-specific cohort, and cycle.  All adver se events occurring on or after treatment on 
Day 1 of Cycle 1 will be summarized by [CONTACT_570618], appropriate thesaurus levels, 
and NCI CTCAE v4.0 toxicity grade.  In addition, all serious adverse events, including deaths will be listed separately and summarized.   
Selected laboratory data will be listed, with values outside of normal ranges identified.  
The incidence of antibodies to DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A will be summarized. 
4.10.3 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Individual and mean serum concentrations of total DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A antibody 
(conjugated and unconjugated antibody) and rituximab  or obinutuzumab  and plasma 
concentrations of acMMAE and free MMAE versus time data will be tabulated and 
plotted by [CONTACT_766205] (relapsed or refractory follicular NHL or DLBCL).  The 
pharmacokinetics of the above analytes will be summarized by [CONTACT_570674] (e.g., AUC, C
max, CL, V ss, and t 1/2).  Estimates for these 
parameters will be tabulated and summarized (mean, standard deviation, and range).  Non-compartmental, compartmental, and/or population methods will be used, as data allow.  
Exposure-response (safety and efficacy) analys is may be conducted with use of PK data 
and available drug effect (e.g., imaging, measures of tumor burden) and toxicity 
(e.g., clinical pathology) data, at the sponsor’s discretion. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
142/P GO27834-A2 In addition, population PK methods may be employed to manage sparse data and to 
investigate the effects of certain covariates on the pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, as data allow, and at the sponsor’s discretion. 
4.10.[ADDRESS_1051084] overall response, duration of response, and PFS will be listed for all patients. 
ORR from the initial study treatment will be calculated on the basis of data from patients 
who received study treatment.  Objective response is defined as CR or PR as determined by [CONTACT_093], on the basis of physical examinations, radiographic scans, and bone marrow examinations, using modified response criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007; see Appendix C) and confirmed by [CONTACT_294862] ≥
 4 weeks 
after initial documentation.  Any patient with insufficient data to determine response will be classified as a non-responder. 
For patients with DLBCL, primary assessment of tumor response will be based on 
diagnostic imaging scans ⎯for example, CT and/or MRI scans and PET scans.  For 
patients with FL  enrolled on rituximab-containing arms/cohorts , primary assessment of 
response will be based on CT scans only; the assessment of response in FL based on PET scans will be performed for exploratory purposes only. 
For patients with DLBCL or FL on ob inutuzumab-containing cohorts, primary 
assessment of tumor response will be based on PET/CT scans.  Given the new Lugano 
Classification, 2014, criteria  which recommend that comp lete response (PET-CR) be 
determined by [CONTACT_10052]-CT scan, patients in Cohorts E, G, and H will be evaluated with a PET-CT scan at screening, between Cycle 4 Day 15 and Cycle 5 Day 1 , and at 6-8 weeks 
after completing treatment.  The efficacy analysis for these cohorts will, therefore, be different from the analysis for Arms A- B and Cohorts C-D. (Cheson, et al 2014) 
(see Appendix C-2).  
Among patients with an objective response, duration of response will be defined as the 
time from the initial documentation of a CR or PR to the time of disease progression or 
death.  If a patient does not experience death or disease progression before the end of 
the study, duration of response will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), PFS is defined as the time from 
the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  If a patient has not experienced progressive disease or death, 
PFS will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.  Patients with no 
post-baseline tumor assessment will be censored on the date of randomization.  For the non-randomized portion of the study (Cohorts C through H ), PFS is defined as the time 
from the date of study enrollment to the date of disease progression or death from any 
cause, whichever occurs first. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
143/P GO27834-A2 For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), OS is defined as the time from 
the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.  For the non-randomized

study enrollment to date of death from any cause. 
4.10.[ADDRESS_1051085] error, and median of the absolute scores and the mean changes from baseline (and 95% CI) within and between study arms will be reported for the MDASI scale s and single items, as well as the weekly 
averages of the worst symptom rating.  For change scores in the MDASI from baseline, patients without baseline scores will not be included in the analyses.  Line charts depi[INVESTIGATOR_260293].   
Frequencies and percentages of missing data for the PRO endpoints will be reported.  
Dropouts (defined as patients withdrawing from treatment for reasons other than documented disease progression or death) will be summarized.

4.10.7 Determination of Sample Size  
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), a target of 120 patients will be enrolled in two separate cohorts of patients (40 in the follicular NHL cohort and 80 in the 
DLBCL cohort).  The randomized portion of this study is non-comparative in nature.  No 
formal hypothesis testing is pl anned to compare the treatmen t arms.  Moreover, there is 
insufficient power to detect minimum clinica lly meaningful differences between the two 
treatment arms.  Genentech has judged the proposed  sample size to provide sufficient 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
144/P GO27834-A2 precision in estimating the anti-tumor activi ty of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab or 
DCDS4501A combined with rituximab as measured by [CONTACT_33966].  For example, 
with the assumption of an observed response rate of 40%, a 90% confidence interval for 
the response rate would be approximately 22% −58% (i.e., 40% ±  18%) for the follicular 
NHL cohort and approximately 27% −53% (i.e., 40% ±  13%) for the DLBCL cohort.   With 
40 patients, there is an 87% chance of observing at least one adverse event with a true incidence of 5%.  
For the non-randomized portions of the study (Cohorts C and D), approximately 20 patients will be enrolled into each arm, for a total of 40 patients.  With 20 patients under an observed response rate of 40%, the exact Clopper-Pearson 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be 22%
−61%.  With respect to the assessment of 
safety based upon a sample size of [ADDRESS_1051087] one adverse event with a true incidence of 10% is 88%. 
For the obinutuzumab safety run-in cohort (Cohort E), 6 patients will be enrolled.  For 
the obinutuzumab expansion cohorts (Cohorts G and H), 40 patients with follicular NHL, and 40 patients with DLBCL will be enrolled at the RP2D to further evaluate safety and efficacy of the combination.  Table 3 provides asymptotic 90% confidence intervals for the true probability of response for a range of  observed proportions based upon a sample of 40 
patients.  A sample size of 40 patients is deemed sufficient to provide adequate precision on the 
point estimate and for the lower end of the 90% CI to rule out a clinically uninteresting rate of 45% 
assuming observed response rates of approximately 60% or higher (~24 responders observed among 
40 patients).

145/P GO27834-A2 Genentech will perform oversight of the data management of this trial.  Genentech will 
produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central Laboratory data and other
 electronic data will be sent 
directly to Genentech, using Genentech’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.  eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  System backups for data stored at Genentech and records retention for the study data will be consistent with Genentech’s standard procedures.

tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug(s). 
Genentech or its designee is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the Competent 
Authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, European Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC), and/or local regulatory requirements. 
Genentech or its designee is responsible for reporting unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening events associated with the use of the study drug to the regulatory agencies and competent authorities by [CONTACT_144530] 7 calendar days after being notified of the event.  Genentech or its designee will report other relevant SAEs 
associated with the use of the study medication to the appropriate competent authorities (according to local guidelines), investigators, and central Institutional Review Board/ethics committee (IRBs/ECs, except in the [LOCATION_002] where investigators ar e 
responsible for reporting to their IRBs per local requirements) by a written safety report within 15 calendar days of notification.   
5.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. 
This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol-specified 
AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with the baseline 
hematologic malignancy (i.e., leukemia or lymphoma) that were not present prior to 
the AE reporting period (see Section 5.2.1) 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
146/P GO27834-A2 • Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions 
(e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
• AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a 
protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., medication washout, no treatment run-in, or 
invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
• Preexisting medical conditions other than the disease under study that are  judged 
by [CONTACT_657161]-specified AE reporting period 
 
5.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that is any of the following: 
• Fatal (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death) 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
the investigational product(s) 
• Considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs. 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous .  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an AE (as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and 
SAEs on the eCRF.  
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
147/P GO27834-A2 5.1.[ADDRESS_1051090] (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_547479] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions), irrespective of regulatory seriousness criteria.  Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
[CONTACT_25742]’s law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]; treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × baseline value 
in combination with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN [of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin]) 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] 
• Grade ≥ 2 motor neuropathy 
• Grade ≥ 2 infusion reactions 
 
5.2 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs (as defined in 
Section 5.1) are recorded on the eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with protocol instructions.  
5.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs caused by a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g., SAEs related to invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run-in). 
After initiation of study drug (the Genentech product(s) or other IMP), all new AEs and 
SAEs regardless of attribution will be collected until [ADDRESS_1051091] administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is later.  After this period, investigators should report only SAEs that are felt to be related to prior study treatment (see Section 5.6).   
5.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all patient evaluation timepoints should be adopted.  Exam ples of non-directive questions include: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1051092].  All AEs 
and SAEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_766295], will 
be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
148/P GO27834-A2 For each AE and SAE recorded on the applicable eCRF, the investigator will make an 
assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.1.2 for seriousness criteria), severity, and causality.

Refer to definitions of an SAE (see Section 5.1.2). 
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or 
reported AE is not in the NCI CTCAE listing. 
 
To ensure consistency of causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guidelines: 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
149/P GO27834-A2 Table 5  Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the AE/SAE suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_362241], 
evidence, science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product administration 
makes a causal relationship possible, A ND other drugs, therapeutic interventions 
or underlying conditions do not provide sufficient explanation for the AE/SAE.   
NO The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product administration 
makes a causal relationship unlikely, OR other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the AE/SAE.   
AE=adverse event; SAE=serious adverse event.  
The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the “Yes” or “No” causality assessment for individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators and applicable regulatory authorities.   
5.[ADDRESS_1051094] medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or 
SAEs on the eCRF.  Avoid co lloquialisms and abbreviations. 
There is one eCRF page for recording AEs or SAEs. 
Only one medical concept should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnos is or syndrome at the time of reporting, 
each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  
However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hem orrhage leads to renal failure, both events 
should be recorded separately on the eCRF. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
150/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient 
evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once in the eCRF unless their severity increases.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it should be recorded again on the Adverse Event eCRF.   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management, 
e.g., concomitant medication, will be recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.) 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5
 × ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term 
should be recorded as the AE or SAE.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Specific to this study, lymphopenia and l eukopenia due to lymphopenia of any grade are 
expected PD effects of study drug and therefore are not considered to be AEs.  
However, complications of lymphopenia (e.g., infections) will need to be reported as AEs.  In addition, because monocytopenia is not reportable and neutropenia is already being monitored and reported as an AE, leukopenia does not need to be reported as a distinct AE. 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF, unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE.  A vital sign result must be reported as an AE if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
151/P GO27834-A2 • Results in a medical intervention (including a diagnostic evaluation not mandated in 
this protocol) or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an AE. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin (>  2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  Therefore, investigators must report as an AE the occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN (of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin) 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours aft er learning of 
the event), either as an SAE or a non-serious adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
Deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period (see Section 5.2.1) that are attributed by [CONTACT_766296].  All other on-study deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor. 
When recording a death on an eCRF, the event or condition that caused or contributed 
to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
152/P GO27834-A2 [IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such 
conditions should be recorded on the Medical and Surgical History eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if  the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent
 headaches”). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Worsening of Basel ine Hematologic Malignancy 
Worsening and/or progression of the baseline hematologic malignancy (e.g. leukemia or lymphoma) should not
 be recorded as an AE or SAE.  These data will be captured as 
efficacy assessment data only.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonge d Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766153].   
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766137].  These scenarios include a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281914]: 
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study 
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a preexisting medical 
condition that has not changed 
• Receive scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
If a female patient becomes pregnant while receiving the study drug or within [ADDRESS_1051095], a Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy report will automatically be generated and sent to Genentech’s Drug Safety Department or its designee.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Male patients must also be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if their 
partner becomes pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_1051096] dose of study drug.  If such an event occurs, it should be reported as described below. 
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should always be classified as an SAE 
(as the Sponsor considers these medically significant), recorded on an Adverse Event eCRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2). 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
153/P GO27834-A2 Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed 
to study drug should be classified as an SAE, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2). 
After the study period, abortions, congenital anomalies/birth defects, and pregnancy 
outcomes should still be reported expeditiously to the Sponsor.   
In the event the EDC system is unava ilable, a paper Pregnancy Report form and 
Pregnancy Fax Coversheet should be completed and faxed to Genentech’s Drug Safety Department or its designee within [ADDRESS_1051097] and report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.  The pregnant partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow-up on her pregnancy.  Once the authorization has been signed, the investigator will update the Pregnancy Report eCRF with additional information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy.  An investigator who is contact[CONTACT_27951], to support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician.

157/P GO27834-A2 6.3 INFORMED CONSENT FORM 
Genentech’s Sample Informed Consent Form will be provided to each site.  Genentech 
or its designee must review and approve any proposed deviations from the Sample Informed Consent Form or any alternate consent forms proposed by [CONTACT_779] (collectively, the “Consent Forms”) before IRB/EC submission.  Patients must be re-consented to the most current version of the Consent Forms during their participation in the study.  The final IRB/EC-approved C onsent Forms must be provided to Genentech 
for regulatory purposes. 
The Consent Forms must be signed by [CONTACT_12718]’s legally authorized 
representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  A copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the pat ient’s legally authorized representative.  
If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language. 
All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in each patient’s study file and must 
be available for verification by [CONTACT_9534]. 
The Informed Consent Form should be revised whenever there are changes to 
procedures outlined in the informed consent or  when new information becomes available 
that may affect the willingness of the patient to participate. 
For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history for each patient shall 
document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained for the updated/revised Consent Form for continued participation in the study.  The final revised IRB/EC-approved Informed Consent Form must be provided to Genentech for regulatory purposes. 
If the site utilizes a separate Authorization Form for patient authorization to use and 
disclose personal health information under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, the review, approval, and other processes 
outlined above apply except that IRB/IEC review and approval may not be required per study site policies. 
Optional Research Informed Consent 
Informed consent for the collection and use of fresh tumor tissue at time of progression for optional research described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be documented in a section of the main Informed Consent Form.  This section provides patients with the option to authorize the collection and use of these samples and personal health information for additional research purposes.  Agreement to participate in the optional research (by [CONTACT_766298]) is not required for enrollment in the trial but is required prior to any optional research sample collection.  Optional consent may be withdrawn at any time by [CONTACT_102]. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
158/P GO27834-A2 6.[ADDRESS_1051103] be submitted to the IRB/EC b y the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_766155].  In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25685]/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the regulatory requirements and policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol changes or amendments and of any unanticipated problem s involving risk to human patients 
or others. 
In addition to the requirements to report protocol-defined AEs to the Sponsor, 
investigators are required to promptly
 report to their respective IRB/EC all unanticipated 
problems involving risk to human patients.  Some IRBs/ECs may want prompt notification of all SAEs, whereas others require notification only about events that are serious, assessed to be related to study treatment, and are unexpected.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety-related communications from Genentech.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements and with the policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and archived in the site’s Study File.

6.[ADDRESS_1051105] be kept with the study records. 

 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
159/P GO27834-A2 6.7 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that critical protocol data 
(i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents are where original patient data are recorded and documented for the 
first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy 
dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments,  certified accurate and 
complete  copi[INVESTIGATOR_26671], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, 
patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Original s ource documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of 
data entered into the eCRFs must never be obliterated or destroyed. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigator(s) and institution(s) must provide the Sponsor direct 
access to all applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, 
Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow inspection 
by [CONTACT_112103]. 
6.8 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the sour ce document if the system has been validated 
in accordance with FDA requirements per taining to computerized systems used in 
clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system (for clinical research purposes) would be one that (1) allows data entry only by [CONTACT_4539]; (2) prevents the deletion or alteration of previously entered data and provides an audit trail for such data changes (e.g., modification of file); (3) protects the database from tampering; and (4) ensures data preservation. 
In collaboration with the study monitor, Genentech’s Quality Assurance group may assist 
in assessing whether electronic records generated from computerized medical record systems used at investigational sites can serve as source documents for the purposes of this protocol. 
If a site’s computerized medical record system is not adequately validated for the 
purposes of clinical research (as opposed to general clinical practice), applicable hardcopy source documents must be maintained to ensure that critical protocol data entered into the eCRFs can be verified. 
 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
160/P GO27834-A2 6.9 STUDY MEDICATION ACCOUNTABILITY

institutional standard operating procedure or returned to Genentech with the appropriate documentation, as determined by [CONTACT_3452] .  If the study site chooses to destroy 
study drug, the method of destruction must be documented. 
Genentech must evaluate and approve the study site’s drug destruction standard 
operating procedure prior to the initiation of drug destruction by [CONTACT_3452]. 
6.[ADDRESS_1051106] parties as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate authorization to use and disclose personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_9536].

medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare for treatment purposes. 
Data generated by [CONTACT_27961], national and local health authorities, Genentech monitors/representativ es and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for 
each study site, if appropriate. 
6.11 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) and the ICH Guideline for GCP (see Section 4.9 of the guideline) require that records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational drug, including eCRFs, consent forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_8178] [ADDRESS_1051107].  All state and local laws for retention of records also apply.

Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL 
Adapted from:  Cheson BD, Pfistner B, Juweid ME, et al. Revised Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma. J Clin Oncol 2007;25:579–86. 
Selection of Indicator (Target) Lesions  
Up to six of the largest dominant nodes or tumor masses selected according to all of the following: 
• Clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions 
Abnormal lymph nodes are those that are either 
>
 [ADDRESS_1051144] transverse diameter (GTD) regardless of the short axis 
diameter, or 
> 10 mm in short axis diameter regardless of long axis 
• If possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body. 
• Should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites 
are involved 
• Extranodal lesions within the liver or spleen must be at least 1.0 cm in 
two perpendicular dimensions. 
 
PET Scans--Definition of a Positive PET scan  
Visual assessment currently is considered adequate for determining whether a PET scan is 
positive, and use of the standardized uptake value is not necessary.  In brief, a positive scan is defined as focal or diffuse FDG uptake above background in a location incompatible with normal anatomy or physiology, without a specific standardized uptake value cutoff.  Other causes of false-positive scans should be ruled out.  Exceptions include mild and diffusely 
increased FDG uptake at the site of moderate or large-sized masses with an intensity that is lower than or equal to the mediastinal blood pool, hepatic or splenic nodules 1.5 cm with FDG uptake lower than the surrounding liver/spleen uptake, and diffusely increased bone marrow uptake within weeks after treatment. 
Complete Remission (CR)  
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease 
and disease-related symptoms if present prior to therapy.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid lymphoma: in patients with no pre-treatment PET scan or when 
the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any 
size is permitted as long as it is PET negative. 
Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, the designation

Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc. 
189/P GO27834-A2 of CR requires all nodal indicator lesions to regress to the size of normal lymph 
nodes.  Lymph nodes that were > [ADDRESS_1051145] regress to ≤ 15 mm in GTD 
regardless of the short axis diameter.  Lymph nodes that were 11 to 15 mm in GTD and >
 [ADDRESS_1051146] 
regress to ≤ 10 mm in the short axis diameter. 
2. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged prior to therapy on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be 
considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to lymphoma should disappear.  However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable 
because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an 
enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma. 
3. If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_248287], the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy.  The biopsy sample on which this determination 
is made must be adequate ( >
 20 mm unilateral core).  If the sample is indeterminate by 
[CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064].  A sample that is negative 
by [CONTACT_127890] a small population of clonal lymphocytes by 
[CONTACT_127891] a CR unt il data become available demonstrating a 
clear difference in patient outcome.  
Partial Remission (PR)  
1. ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to [ADDRESS_1051147] 
dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes or masses should be selected 
according to the following: (a) they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 
perpendicular dimensions; (b) if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; (c) they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever 
these sites are involved. 
2. No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen. 
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥
 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, 
in the greatest transverse diameter. 
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present. 
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive prior to treatment.  However, if positive, the cell type should be specified 
(e.g., large-cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells).  Patients who achieve a complete 
remission by [CONTACT_86950], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow 
involvement will be considered partial responders. 
6. No new sites of disease should be observed (e.g., nodes > 1.5 cm in any axis).

least one previously involved site. 
8. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown : for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be used. 
1. In patients with follicular lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated with one or at most 
two residual masses that have regressed by [CONTACT_726] 50% on CT; those with more 
than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be considered 
partial responders. 
Stable Disease (SD)  
1. Failing to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but not fulfilling those for progressive 
disease (see below). 
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphomas : the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with 
no new areas of involvement on the post- treatment CT or PET. 
3. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown : for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size 
of the previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan. 
Relapsed Disease (RD; after CR) or Progressive Disease (PD; for Patients 
with PR or SD)  
1. Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm, regardless of 
the short axis.  If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1− 1.5 cm, it should only be 
considered abnormal if its short axis is > 1.0.  Lymph nodes ≤  1.0 cm by ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1051148] a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD  of any previously involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules).

Selection of measured dominant (indicator) lesions: 
• Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two 
diameters 
A measurable node must have an LDi greater than 1.[ADDRESS_1051152] an LDi greater than 1.0 cm. 
• Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and 
retroperitoneal areas.  
• Non-nodal lesions include those in solid organs (e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or 
those noted on palpation.  
• If possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body. • Should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas  of disease whenever these sites are involved 
 
Selection of non-measured (non-indicator) lesions: 
• Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and tr uly assessable disease should be considered not measured.   
These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not 
meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural effusions, 
ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_9661].

Recommendations for the Use of White Blood Cell Growth 
Factors 
Primary Prophylactic G-CSF Administration (First and Subsequent-Cycle Use)  
Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is recommended if any of the following clinical factors 
are present: 
• Age >65 years 
• Poor performance status 
• Previous history of febrile neutropenia 
• Open wounds or active infections • More advanced cancer 
• Extensive prior treatment, includi ng large radiation therapy ports

Secondary Prophylactic G-CSF Administration
 
Prophylactic G-CSF administration is recommended for patients who fulfill each of the 
following circumstances: 
• Experienced a neutropenic complication from a prior cycle of study treatment 
• Primary prophylactic G-CSF was not received; and 
• The intent is to avoid dose reduction of the antibody −drug conjugate (ADC), where 
the effect of the reduced dose on disease-free, overall survival or treatment 
outcome is not known 
 
Therapeutic Use of G-CSF  
G-CSF administration should be considered for the following patients: 
• Patients with febrile neutropenia who are at high risk for infection-associated 
complications; or 
• Patients who have prognostic factors that are predictive of poor clinical outcome, 
e.g., prolonged (>10 days) and profound (<100/ μL) neutropenia, age >65 years, 
uncontrolled primary disease, pneumonia, hypotension and multi-organ dysfunction

    PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY: 
VERSION 1 
RATIONALE 
Protocol GO27834 has been amended to enable the following changes: 
• Additional cohorts of approximately 20 patients each (denoted Cohort C and 
Cohort D) to assess DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg in 
combination with rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 in patients with 
relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma  have been added.  The purpose of enrolling 
additional cohorts of patients with follicular lymphoma is to determine whether the lower dose level of antibody −drug conjugate (ADC) in combination with standard 
doses of rituximab result in improved tolerability while maintaining efficacy in 
follicular lymphoma.  The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s 
discretion based on safety and clinical activity observed in the randomized part of 
the study.  Patients will not be randomized to one cohort or another.  Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in this nonrandomized portion of 
the study will enroll patients into these cohorts.   
• Patients enrolled into Cohorts C and D will not be eligible to receive crossover 
treatment.  Cohorts C and D will support the study’s primary objectives to assess 
safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of the ADCs (plus rituximab) at the 1.8-mg/kg dose level. 
• Updated safety and efficacy information from the ongoing Phase I studies 
(DCT4862g and DCS4968g) have been provided (see Sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2). 
• The definitions of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival have been 
updated (see Section 4.10.4). 
• Procedures for reporting non-serious adverse events of special interest and serious 
adverse events have been updated (see Sections 5.1.3 and 5.4). 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.   
Substantive new information appears in italics.   This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  DCDT2980S Clinical Data 
a. Patient Enrollment 
All data presented herein is based on a data entry cutoff of 22 February 2013 22 June 
2012 , with clinical data available from 6549  patients with NHL (excluding patients with 
CLL) enrolled in dose-escalation and expansion cohorts.  These include 36 49 patients 
who were treated with single-agent DCDT2980S at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg 
administered intravenously every 21 days, and 13 16 patients who were enrolled into two 
Phase Ib cohorts with DCDT2980S administered at doses of 1.8 mg/kg (5 patients) and 2.4 mg/kg (8
11 patients) in combination with 375 mg/m2 rituximab. 
Seven patients have been enrolled Enrollment into CLL dose escalation cohorts was 
closed on 31 May 2013 to date .  Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure for 
details regarding clinical data in CLL patients. 
b. Pharmacokinetics 
Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis based on available data as of 22 June 2012 is 
summarized below.   
c. Safety 
Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Separate dose-escalation cohorts enrolled patients with B-cell NHL and CLL.  For the 
NHL dose escalation, DLTs of Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient out of 3 DLT-evaluable patients in the 3.2 mg/kg single agent cohort and 1 patient out of 8 
11 DLT-evaluable patients in the 2.4 mg/kg + rituximab cohort.  Consequently, 
DCDT2980S at 2.4 mg/kg was determined to be the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) as both monotherapy and in combination with rituximab.   Patients are currently 
being enrolled in monotherapy expansion cohorts  for various types of NHL in order to 
collect and further characterize both single ag ent and combination safety data.  
For the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, one DLT out of six DLT evaluable patients was 
reported  to date …

    Single-Agent DCDT2980S  and DCDT2980S Combined wi th Rituximab in NHL  
Enrollment into NHL indication-specific monotherapy expansion cohorts and the 
DCDT2980S plus rituximab cohorts has been completed. 
Forty-nine patients receiv ed single-agent DCDT2980S at a starting dose of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg 
(7 at 1.8 mg/kg, 42 at 2.4 mg/kg); 16 patien ts received DCDT2980S at a starting dose 
of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg in combination with rituximab (5 at 1.8 mg/kg, 11 at 2.4 mg/kg).  
Overall the safety pro file of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab did no t differ from 
that of single-agent DCDT2980S. Treatment emergent hematologic and commonly reported nonhematologic adverse 
events for all grades in patients tr eated with single-agent DCDT2980S and 
DCDT2980S plus rituximab included neutro penia (29%), febril e neutropenia (3%), 
infection (system organ class; 43%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (12%), peripheral neuropathy (28%), diarrhea ( 40%), pyrexia (14%), nausea (34%), and

peripheral neuropathy (3%), diarrhea (5%), pyrexia (2%), and fatigue (3%).  Serious adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_766210]2980S were reported in 21% of patients.  Dose discontinuations for adverse events were reported in 20% of patients. 
Refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator’s Broc hure for complete and updated details 
related to safety. Adverse events regardless of relationship to study drug were reported 
in 32 of 36  NHL patients (97.0%) enrolled into the single agent dose cohorts.  
The most common of these  adverse events in ≥ 10% of patients were neutropenia 
(7 patients 21.2%), anaemia (7  patients 21.2%), nausea  (10 patients 30.3%), diarrhea 
(11 patients 33.3%), constipation (7  patients 21.2%), vomiting (7  patients 21.2%),

18.2%), dyspnea (6  patients 18.2%), nasal congestion (4  patients 12.1%), rash 
(5 patients 15.2%) and neuropathy (5  patients 15.2%).  
All patients treated at the RP2D of 2.4  mg/kg (n  = 10 enrolled in dose escalati on and 
expansion cohorts) experienced an adverse event.  The most common adverse events 
of all grades in ≥ 2 patients were anaemia (3  patients), nausea (3  patients), fatigue 
(3 patients), dizziness (3  patients), vomiting (2  patients), constipation (2  patie nts), chills 
(2 patients), decreased appetite (2  patients), dyspnea (2  patients), alopecia (2  patients),

    Grade  ≥3 adverse events regardless of relationship to study drug were reported in 21 
(58.3%) of 36 NHL patients  enrolled into the single agent dose cohorts .  Neutropenia 
was reported in 8 (24.2%) patients.  Grade  35 adverse events reported in ≥ 2 patients 
included hyperglycemia (3  patients), anemia (3  patients), diarrhea, hyponatremia, 
hypoxia, pneumonia, peripher al neuropathy, and dehydration (2  patients each).

febrile neutropenia in a CLL patient treated with one cycle of DCDT2980S at 1.0  mg/kg 
(described in the previous section), a Grade  3 pneumonia in a CLL patient treated one 
cycle of DCDT2980S at 1 .8 mg/kg, and a Grade  3 dehydration in a NHL patient enrolled 
in the 3.2  mg/kg single agent DCDT2980S dose escalation cohort.  
No serious adverse events were reported among patients treated at the RP2D of 
2.4 mg/kg single agent DCDT2980S.   
DCDT2980S in Co mbination with Rituximab  
DCDT2980S in combination with rituximab was administered in two dose cohorts of 
1.8 mg/kg and 2.4  mg/kg.  Adverse events regardless of relationship to study drug were 
reported in [ADDRESS_1051159] 
common of these adverse events in ≥ 2 patients were nausea (3  patients), fatigue 
(3 patients), and rash (3  patients).  
Four of 8  patients treated at the RP2D of 2.4  mg/kg of DCDT2980S experienced an 
adverse event.  Adverse events occurring in 2 or more patients included nausea and 
decreased  appetite.  
Grade  ≥3 adverse events regardless of relationship to study drug were reported in 6 
(46.2%) of patients taking rituximab in combination with DCDT2980S.   The most 
common event occurring in 2 or more patients was neutropenia, with 1  patient in eac h of 
the two combination therapy cohorts (1.8  mg/kg and 2.4  mg/kg of DCDT2980S) 
reporting Grade  35 neutropenia.  No other Grade  35 adverse event was reported in 
more than 1  patient. 
One serious adverse event of shortness of breath unrelated to DCDT2980S was 
reported in a patient treated with 2.4  mg/kg DCDT2980S in combination with rituximab.

    In the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, two DLTs were reported at the single-agent dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.  One patient had a Grade 4 neutropenia, and 1 patient had a Grade 4 invasive fungal infection.   
Single-Agent DCDS4501A  and DCDS4501A Combined with Rituximab
 
Fifty-one patients received single agent DCDS4501A at a starting dose of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg 
(6 at 1.8 mg/kg, 45 at 2.4 mg/kg); an addi tional 9 patients re ceived DCDS4501A at a 
dose of 2.4 mg/kg in combination with rituximab.  Overall, the safety profile of DCDS4501A combined with rituximab did no t differ from that of single-agent 
DCDS4501A. 
Treatment emergent hematologic and commonly reported non-hematologic adverse 
events for all grades in patients tr eated with single-agent DCDS4501A and 
DCDS4501A plus rituximab included neutro penia (50%), febril e neutropenia (5%), 
infection (system organ class; 35%), anemia (13%), thrombocytopenia (18%), peripheral neuropathy (32%), diarrhea ( 43%), pyrexia (37%), nausea (35%), and 
fatigue (18%).  Treatment emergent Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included neutropenia 
(43%), febrile neutropenia (5%), infection (system organ class; 10%), anemia (8%), 
peripheral neuropathy (7%), diarrhea (3%), pyrexia (2%), and fatigue (5%).  Serious adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_766310]4501A were 
reported in 20% of patients.  Dose discontinuations for adverse events were reported in 33% of patients. 
Refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator’s Broc hure for complete and updated details 
related to safety.

    term), leukopenia (unmapped term), hypokal emia (unmapped term), and hyperglycemia 
(unmapped term).  
Grade  ≥ 3 adverse events regardless of relationship to study drug were reported in 22 
(68.8%) of NHL patients treate d with single agent DCDS4501A across all dose levels.  
The most common of these events in ≥ 10% of patients were neutropenia (13  patients
40.6%) and leukopenia (5  patients 15.6%).  
Seven of twelve patients treated at the RP2D of 2.4  mg/kg experienced a Grad e 35 
adverse event.  Grade  34 events in reported in 2 or more patients included neutropenia 
(unmapped term, 4  patients), neutropenia (mapped term), leukopenia (unmapped term), 
and anemia, (2  patients each).  
A total of 27 serious adverse events were repor ted in 15  patients (30.6%) across all 
dose levels.  Six of these events, occurring in 4  patients, were considered related to 
study treatment.  These included Grade  3 peripheral neuropathy in 3  patients, and 
Grade  2 pyrexia and Grade  3 lobar pneumonia in 1 patient each.  Three separately 
reported but concurrent serious adverse events of Grade  4 neutropenia, Grade  4 febrile 
neutropenia and Grade  4 pneumonia were reported in another patient.  
DCDS4501A in Combination with Rituximab  
Adverse events regardless of relationship to study drug were reported in 6  patients 
receiving DCDS4501A at a dose of 2.4  mg/kg combined with rituximab in the Phase  Ib 
cohorts.  The most common of these adverse events in more than 2  patients were 
anaemia (2  patients), leukopenia (2  patients), neutropenia/febrile neutropenia 
(3 patients), nausea (3  patients), fatigue (2  patients), constipation (2  patients) and

    combined with rituximab.  Among patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, objective 
responses were observed in 16 of 30 (53%; 4 CR, 12 PR) patients treated with DCDS4501A; 1 patient with DLBCL was tr eated with DCDS4501A combined with 
rituximab and achieved a PR.  Among patients with relapsed/refractory iNHL, objective responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%; 2 CR, 5 PR) patients treated with single-agent DCDS4501A and 5 of 5 (100%; 2 CR, 3 PR) pa tients treated with DCDS4501A plus 
rituximab. To date, no formal analysis of anti
tumor activity has been performed for 
Study  DCS4968g.  Anti tumor activity has been reported in patients treated with 
single agent DCDS4501A as well as DCDS4501A when combin ed with rituximab.    
SECTION 1.3.1:  Rationale for Assessing ADC Do se of 1.8 mg/kg Combined 
with Rituximab in iNHL  
Based on available Phase I data (see Se ction 1.2.1 and 1.2.2), both DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A as single-agents and combined with rituximab ha ve shown early signs of 
clinical activity in heavily pretreated patien ts with relapsed/refractory NHL.  However, 
early evidence in the Phase I studies indicate that duration of study treatment may be limited by [CONTACT_766221].  Specific ally, for both ADCs, peripheral sensory 
neuropathy has been identified as a known risk (see Section 3.4.2).  Notably, [ADDRESS_1051160] shown single-a gent activity at the 1.8 mg/kg dose 
level (Advani et al. 2012; Palanca-Wess els et al. 2012), the purpose of enrolling 
additional cohorts of patients with follicul ar lymphoma is to determine whether lower 
doses of ADC in combination with standard doses of rituximab result in improved 
tolerability while maintaining efficacy in follicular lymphoma.   
In contrast to iNHL, treatment paradigms in  relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas 
such as DLBCL continue to place a premium on anti-tumor activity and higher 
tolerance for treatment-related toxicity gi ven that durations of disease control and 
survival are substantially shorter and that treatment options are extremely limited.  Early Phase I data suggest lower rates of study treatment discontinuation for adverse events among patients with DLBCL compared with patients with iNHL.  Taken together with anti-tumor activity observed to date, the risk-benefit profile of the 
currently tested ADC dose of 2.4 mg/kg is considered acceptable  
SECTION 2.3.3:  Crosso ver Treatment Objective  
• To preliminarily assess the safety and tolerability and anti-tumor activity of 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, either as a single-agent or in combination with 
rituximab, as crossover treatment following disease progression on initial study 
treatment (Note:  This objective only applies to patients enrolled in Arms A and B 
[see Section 3.1])

    SECTION 3.1:  DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This is a Phase II, randomized, multicenter, open-label study.  No formal testing 
comparing the two treatment arms is planned .  A total of approximately 
140120−160 patients (approximately 60−8040  patients with relapsed or refractory 
follicular NHL and approximately 80 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL) will be 
enrolled at approximately 30–40 investigative sites worldwide.  Additional patients may be enrolled in order to obtain additional safety and/or efficacy data.   
The study will be composed of a randomized  portion and a nonrandomized portion, as 
illustrated in Figure 3. 
Figure 3 (Study Schema) has been added. 
SECTION 3.1.1:  Randomized Portion of the Study (Arms A and B)  
No formal testing comparing the two treatment arms in the randomized portion of the 
study is planned.   
SECTION 3.1.2:  Nonrandomized Portion of th e Study (Cohorts C and D)  
Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the nonrandomized portion of the study will enroll patients into these cohorts. 
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled in Cohorts C and D 
to receive rituximab (375 mg/m
2) combined with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A at a 
dose of 1.8 mg/kg.  The first day of treatment constitutes Day 1 of each cycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766116] 21 days in duration. 
The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s discretion and only after 
the enrollment of follicular lymphoma patients into the randomized portion of the study is completed.  Patients will not be randomized to receive one treatment or the other.  It is anticipated that Cohort C and D will be opened sequentially.   
SECTION 3.1.3:  All Patients  
All patients, regardless of assigned arm/cohort Patients will receive DCDT2980S or 
DCDS4501A and rituximab administered by [CONTACT_766203] a 21-day cycle… 
SECTION 3.1.6:  Crossover Treatment  (Randomized Patients Only)  
Patients randomized assigned to Arm A or Arm B who develop progressive disease may be 
eligible to receive crossover treatment consisting of rituximab and the other ADC, or the other ADC alone, e.g., Arm B treatment for patients who have disease progression while receiving Arm A treatment and vice versa, provided the following conditions are met: 
• Patients who are enrolled into the nonrandomized portion of the study (Cohorts C 
and D) will not have the option to receive crossover treatment upon disease 
progression (see Section 3.2 for rationale).

    SECTION 3.2:  RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
The primary rationale for the this randomized non-comparative Phase  II study design 
portion of the study is to assess clinical activity for the ADCs DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL…   
The primary rationale for the nonrandomized portion of the study is to assess the 
therapeutic index (i.e., the balance of efficacy and tolerability of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg in patients  with relapsed or refractory follicular 
NHL).  An informal comparison between patients with follicular NHL treated at the two doses of the ADC will help determine if tolerability is improved at the lower ADC 
dose without substantial compromise of efficacy.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Hyperglycemia  
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A as well as with other antibody-dr ug conjugates using the same vc-MMAE 
platform.  Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs and/or initiation or adjustment of anti-hyperglycemic medications. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Hepatotoxicity  
Hepatotoxicity is a potential risk of the AD Cs.  Definitive attribution of hepatotoxicity 
to the ADCs has not been established.  Transient dose-related increases in hepatic enzyme levels were observed in rats  treated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  
Elevations in transaminase and/or bilirubin levels requiring dose modifications have 
been reported in the ongoing clinical studies.

    ADC dose increased to 2.4 mg/kg if it is fe lt that there is reasonable justification for 
ongoing clinical benefit.  The decision to incr ease the dose must be made in consultation 
with and approval of the Medical Monitor. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Neutropenia 
• For patients enrolled into the nonrandomized portion of the study (Cohorts C 
and D), dose modifications will not be allowed.  Administration of 
therapeutic/prophylactic G-CSF and dose-schedule modifications as described above 
are allowed.  Patients who have persistent or recurrent Grade 3 −4 neutropenia as 
defined above should be discontinued from study treatment. 
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy 
For patients enrolled into the nonrandomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and D), 
dose modifications will not be allowed.  Patients who have Grade 2 or 3 peripheral

SECTION 5.1.3:  Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest 
(Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Non-serious adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_547479] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting in structions), irrespective of regulatory 
seriousness criteria.  Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST 
in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
[CONTACT_25742]’s law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]; treatment-emergent ALT or AST 
> 3 × baseline value 
in combination with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN [of which 35% is direct bilirubin]) 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] 
• Grade ≥2 motor neuropathy 
• Grade ≥2 infusion reactions 
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (including a diagnostic evaluation not mandated 
in this protocol) or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
16/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
16/P GO27834 A-1  Summ
 
      
    Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis 
or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  Therefore, investigators must report  as an adverse event the occurrence of 
either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST 
> 3 × baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN (of which 35% is  direct bilirubin) 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or  a non-serious adverse event of special 
interest (see Section 5.4.2)  
SECTION 5.4.2:  Reporting Requirements for All SAEs Reporting 
Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and Non-Serious Adverse 
Events of Special Interest  
For reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest, investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the EDC system.  A report will be generated and sent  to the Sponsor’s Safety Risk Management 
department by [CONTACT_27950]. 
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, a paper Serious Adverse 
Event/Non-serious Adverse Event of Special Interest CRF and Fax Coversheet should be completed and faxed to Safety Risk Mana gement or its designee immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event), using the fax numbers provided below.  Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to  be entered and 
submitted via the EDC system.   
Investigators will submit reports of all SAEs, regardless of attribution, to Genentech 
within [ADDRESS_1051173] all case details that can be gathered within 24  hours  on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF 
and submit the report via the EDC system.  A report will be generated and sent to 
Genentech’s Drug Safety Department.  In the event that the EDC system is unavailable,

Study Design  
This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-l abel study.  A total of approximately 140−160 patients 
(approximately 60−80 patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL and approximately 
80 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBC L) will be enrolled at approximately 30–40 
investigative sites worldwide.  Additional patients may be enrolled in order to obtain additional 
safety and/or efficacy data. 
Randomized Portion of the Study (Arms A and B)  
Following determination of eligibility, patients within each disease group will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments: 
• Arm A: Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S (2.4 mg/kg) every 21 days; 
• Arm B: Rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_766192]4501A (2.4 mg/kg) every [ADDRESS_1051182] to the following 
stratification factors: 
• For patients with follicular lymphoma (see Section 3.1.1 for definitions) 
Rituximab refractory disease (no response or disease relapse < [ADDRESS_1051183] 
rituximab treatment) vs. rituximab relapsed disease (disease relapse after 
response ≥ [ADDRESS_1051184] rituximab treatment) 
• For patients with DLBCL (see Section 3.1.2 for definitions) 
Second-line vs. third-line (or beyond) therapy 
For second-line patients, disease relapse or  no objective response (CR, CRu or PR) 
<12 months from the start of initial therapy ve rsus disease relapse, after initial objective 
response (CR, CRu or PR), ≥[ADDRESS_1051185]-line patients, failure to achieve a CR or progression < [ADDRESS_1051186] 
recent therapy versus  CR or progression ≥ [ADDRESS_1051187] recent therapy 
No formal testing comparing the two treatment arms in the randomized portion of the study 
is planned. Nonrandomized Portion of the Study (Cohorts C and D)
 
Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the nonrandomized portion of 
the study will enroll patients into these cohorts. Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular  NHL will be enrolled in Cohorts C and D to 
receive rituximab (375 mg/m
2) combined with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A at a dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.  The first day of treatment constitutes Day 1 of each cycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766116] 
21 days in duration. 
The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s discretion and only after the 
enrollment of follicular lymphoma patients into the randomized portion of the study is 
completed.  Patients will not be randomized to receive one treatment or the other.  It is 
anticipated that Cohort C and D will be opened sequentially.

  All Patients  
All patients, regardless of assigned arm/cohort will receive DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and 
rituximab administered by [CONTACT_766203] a 21-day cy cle.  For the first two cycles, rituximab will 
be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 1 and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A will be administered 
by [CONTACT_95077] 2.  In the absence of any infusion-related adverse events, rituximab and 
DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be administered on  the same day (Day 1) in subsequent 
cycles beginning with the third cycle.  In this instance, rituximab will be administered first, followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S or DCDS4501A.  In ce rtain circumstances, e.g., infusion-related 
reactions requiring interruption or slowing of infusion rate, rituximab may be administered over 2 days, e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the cycle; in  this case, DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be 
administered on Day 2 following completion of the ri tuximab infusion or on Day 3 of the cycle. 
Patients may receive treatments for up to 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule) if not 
discontinued due to significant toxicity, diseas e progression, or withdrawal from study. 
Patients will be evaluated for safety and effica cy according to the schedules of assessments 
outlined in Appendices A-1, A-2, and A-3.  Initial response assessments in this study will be 
performed every 3 months from the initiation of therapy until study treatment completion or early 
termination (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1051188] eight 21-day cycles of treatment).  Additional response assessments for patients who 
proceed to crossover treatm ent (see Section 3.1.3) will be performed as described in 
Appendix A-2; response assessments for pat ients who discontinue study treatment 
(both initially assigned treatment and crossove r treatment) for reasons other than disease 
progression will be performed as described in Appendix A-3. 
Responses to study treatment w ill be based on investigator assessments.  In addition, tumor 
assessment data will be transmitted to an Independen t Review Facility (IRF) for collection and 
possible independent review. Follicular NHL Cohort 
Patients with relapsed or refrac tory follicular NHL will be enrolled into the study as defined by 
[CONTACT_716]: 
• Relapsed
 to regimens containing rituximab, defined as documented history of response 
(complete response [CR], unconfirmed CR  [CRu], or partial response [PR]) of ≥ 6 months in 
duration from completion of all prior  rituximab-containing regimens.  A rituximab-containing 
regimen is defined as rituximab as a single age nt during induction and/or maintenance, or in 
combination with other agents during induction and/or maintenance. 
• Refractory  to any prior  regimen containing rituximab, defined as no response to, 
or progression within [ADDRESS_1051189] dose of rituximab therapy 
(either as monotherapy or in combi nation with chemotherapy), including: 
Patients with progressive disease while receiving rituximab monotherapy, 
rituximab combined with chemotherapy, or  rituximab maintenance therapy; patients 
must have received at least one full dose (375 mg/m2) of rituximab 
Patients with no objective response (PR or CR) to a rituximab-containing regimen consisting of at least [ADDRESS_1051190] 4 cycles of 
rituximab combined with chemotherapy 
 
Enrollment of patients with refractory diseas e as defined above may be limited to no greater 
than 60% of the total Follicular NHL cohort, in orde r to avoid overrepresentation of the refractory 
disease population.

  DLBCL 
Cohort 
Patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are determined by [CONTACT_766316]/stem cell transplant (SCT) as 
determined by [CONTACT_766317]: 
• Second-line SCT-ineligible patients with progressive disease or no response 
(SD) < 12 months from start of initial therapy (2L refractory ) 
• Second-line SCT-ineligible patients with  disease relapse after initial response ≥ 12 months 
from start of initial therapy (2L relapsed ) 
• Third-line (or beyond) SCT-ineligible patients with progressive disease or no response 
(SD) < 6 months from start of prior therapy (3L  + refractory ) 
• Third-line (or beyond) SCT-ineligible patients with disease relapse after initial response 
≥ 6 months from start of prior therapy (3L+ relapsed ) 
 
Enrollment to any of the above four categories may be limited to no greater than 40% of the 
DLBCL cohort—and to no more than 60% of the two refractory categories combined—in order 
to avoid overrepresentation of any specific su bpopulation, refractory patients in particular. 
Crossover Treatment  (Randomized Patients Only)  
Patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B who develop progressive disease may be eligible to 
receive crossover treatment consisting of rituxi mab and the other ADC, or  the other ADC alone, 
e.g., Arm B treatment for patients who have disease progression while receiving Arm A 
treatment and vice versa, provided the following conditions are met: 
• Patients must not have experienced a to xicity requiring the discontinuation of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment OR experienced  toxicity during the last dose of study 
treatment that would preclude treatment with the crossover regimen. 
Patients who had modifications to dosing and/ or schedule on the initial study treatment 
will be permitted to receive cr ossover treatment in the absence of toxicities on the 
modified dose and/or schedule.  The dose and schedule of crossover treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_33495]. 
Patients who had rituximab discontinued and continued on single-agent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment may rece ive crossover treatment of single-agent 
DCDS4501A/ DCDT2980S  
• Patients must have radiographica lly documented disease progression 
• Patients must meet all inclusion and exclus ion criteria described in Sections 4.1.1 and 
4.1.2, except for those related to prior rituximab treatment. 
• Acceptable toxicity:  All study drug–related adv erse events from the initial study treatment 
must have decreased to Grade [ADDRESS_1051191] day of treatment 
on the crossover regimen.  Exceptions may be allowed after a careful assessment and discussion of the risk-benefit balance with the patient by [CONTACT_766318]. 
• Administration of crossover treatment must be in the best interests of the patient 
as determined after a careful assessment and discussion of risk-benefit balance with the 
patient by [CONTACT_766277]. 
• A tumor biopsy will be required for patients with safely accessible site of disease, defined as 
requiring only local anesthesia and in general excluding brain, lungs or any internal organs 
that may subject patients to significant risk.  
Patients for whom a safely ac cessible site of disease is not present may still receive 
crossover treatment without undergoing a biopsy.  Eligibility to receive crossover treatment should be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_1689]. 
A tumor biopsy of a safely accessible site of  disease is optional for patients who are not 
eligible for study cross over.

  Patients who are deter
mined to be eligible for study crossover will be treated as follows: 
• Assessments obtained at the initial study treatment discontinuation visit may be used as 
screening assessments for cros sover treatment.  The following re-screening assessments 
must be repeated/obtained within 1 week pr ior to starting treatment on the crossover 
regimen in order to re-establish baseline pretre atment clinical and disease status:  targeted 
physical exam, ECOG status and hematol ogy and serum chemistry laboratories. 
Re-screening tests for Hepatitis B and C do not need to be performed unless there is 
clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_766169] B and/or C positivity. 
A radiographic tumor assessment must also be performed, unless already done to 
document disease progression, within 6 we eks prior to starting crossover treatment. 
• Crossover treatment will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1051192] dose of the prior study 
treatment. 
Patients will be treated with the crossover treatment until a second disease progression event 
relative to the tumor assessment document ing progressive disease on the initial study 
treatment, clinical deterioration and/or intole rance to the crossover treatment for up to a 
maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule).  Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules of assessments outlined in Appendices A-2.  
Response assessments for patients who discontin ue study treatment for reasons other than 
disease progression will be performed as described in Appendix A-3.  
Clinical data and exploratory data derived from  tumor biopsies obtained prior to crossover 
treatment will be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Ge nentech has the right to  restrict or suspend 
enrollment into crossover treatment at any time .  Reasons for this may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
• The incidence or severity of adverse events during crossover treatment indicates a potential 
safety hazard to patients. 
• Patient enrollment into crossove r treatment is unsatisfactory. 
• Data recording is inac curate or incomplete.  
• Patients who are enrolled into the nonrandomi zed portion of the study (Cohorts C and D) 
will not have the option to receive cr ossover treatment upon disease progression.  
Outcome Measures
 
Safety Outcome Measures 
The safety and tolerability of the combinat ion of DCDT2980S and rituximab and DCDS4501A 
and rituximab will be assessed using the following safety outcome measures: 
• Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events 
• Incidence of anti-DCDT2980S or anti-DCDS4501A antibodies 
• Changes in vital signs 
• Changes in laboratory values 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Outcome Measures 
The following PK parameters will be derived from the serum concentration–time profiles of total 
antibody (the sum of conjugated and unconjugated antibody), including rituximab, and plasma 
concentration-time profiles of antibody c onjugated-MMAE (acMMAE) and free MMAE following 
administration of DCDT2980S or DCDS 4501A, when appropriate as data allow: 
• Total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) 
• Maximum plasma and serum concentration (C max) 
• Clearance (CL) 
• Terminal half-life (t1/2) 
• Steady state volume of distribution (Vss). 
Compartmental, non-compartmental, and/or population methods may be used.  Other parameters, such as accumulation ratio and trough plasma and serum concentration (C
min), 
may also be calculated.

  The following PD outcom
e measures will be assessed when appropri ate, as data allow: 
• Peripheral blood B-cell depletion and recovery.  For each visit at which CD19+ B-cell 
measurements are taken, B-cell data will be list ed for each patient by [CONTACT_766279]: 
Absolute blood cell counts 
Percent change relative to the baseline blood counts CD19+ B-cell recovery, defined as the timepoint when the values return to baseline 
levels or ≥ 50% of baseline levels 
Activity Outcome Measures 
The following activity outcome  measures will be assessed: 
• Objective response, defined as a PR or CR 
• Duration of objective response, defined as t he first occurrence of a documented objective 
response until the time of relapse or death from any cause 
• Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as t he date of randomization to the first occurrence 
of progression or death within [ADDRESS_1051193] 
• Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
death from any cause 
Objective response and disease progression will be determined using standard criteria for NHL 
(Cheson et al. 2007; see Appendix C). 
 
Safety Plan  
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for comple te details of the safety evaluation for this 
study. 
Safety will be evaluated through the monitoring of the following: 
• Serious adverse events that are attributed to protocol-mandated interventions from the time 
of signing informed consent until the first dose of study treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1 
• All adverse events from Cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_1051194] dose of DCDT2980S, 
DCDS4501A or rituximab whichever is later, in cluding doses that were administered as part 
of crossover treatment 
• All serious adverse events from Cycle 1,  Day [ADDRESS_1051195] dose of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A or rituximab whichever  is later, including doses that were 
administered as part of crossover treatment 
• All serious adverse events from the last  dose of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A or rituximab 
whichever is later, including doses that were  administered as part of crossover treatment, 
and which is judged to be caused by [CONTACT_766191]2980S, DCDS4501A or rituximab, regardless of 
time of onset 
• Measurements of protocol-spe cified hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory values 
• Measurements of protocol-specified vital signs 
• Assessment of ECGs 
• Assessment of physical findings on clinical physical examinations 
Patients who have an ongoing study  drug-related adverse event wi ll be followed until the event 
has resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_226876], 
new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws 
consent, when it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause 
of the adverse event, or the study is terminated. 
See Section 5.2.3 for assessment of causality for adverse events. 
INTERNAL MONITORING COMMITTEE (IMC) 
This study will employ an Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC).  The purpose of the IMC will be 
to make recommendations regarding study conduc t on the basis of trial safety data to ensure 
patient safety while receiving study treatment. 
32/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
32/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051196], includ ing but not limited to: performing additional 
safety analyses, amending the study protocol , holding patient enrollment to one or both 
treatment arms pending further safety evaluatio ns, holding/discontinuing study treatment, or 
terminating the study. 
Complete details of the IMC will be described in the IMC charter. 
Risks Associated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A 
The clinical safety profile of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A based on clinical data obtained in 
the ongoing Phase I studies are summarized in Secti ons [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  Based on clinical 
data to date, the following known and suspected ri sks are described below.  Guidelines around 
the management of these risks through dose and schedule modifications are described in 
Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.  Refer also to the Investigator Brochure for complete and updated 
details. 
Infusion-Related Events 
Some monoclonal antibodies may be associated with the development of allergic or 
anaphylactic reactions, to either the active pr otein or excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  True allergic/anaphylactic 
reactions are rare after the first dose of a produc t, as they require prior sensitization.  Patients 
with true allergic/anaphylactic reactions should not receive further doses of the product.  
Monoclonal antibodies may also be associated with reactions that are clinic ally indistinguishable 
from true allergic/anaphylactic reactions, but which are mediated through direct release of 
cytokines or other pro-inflammatory mediat ors.  Such reactions are often termed 
infusion-related reactions.  Infusion-related reacti ons typi[INVESTIGATOR_570587] a 
monoclonal antibody product and are generally less frequent and/or less severe with subsequent infusions.  They can often be managed by [CONTACT_570664]/or 
pre-treatment with various medications. 
Allergic/anaphylactic reactions and infusion-rela ted reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_766170].  The onset of symptoms may be rapid, and some 
reactions may be life threatening. 
Patients should be monitored for these types of reactions during and after receiving 
DCDT2908S and DCDS4501A.  DCDT2980S and DC DS4501A should be administered in an 
environment under close supervision of a physici an and where full resuscitation facilities are 
immediately available.  Specific guidelines for additional precautions to be taken during and following DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A administr ation are provided in Sections [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
There is a potential risk of tumor lysis syndr ome (TLS) if treatment with DCDT2980S or 
DCDS4501A results in the rapid de struction of a large number of tumor cells.  If any evidence of 
this occurs during the study, tumor lysis prophy laxis measures will be instituted.  Patients who 
are considered to have a high tumor burden, e.g., lymphocyte count ≥ 25 x 109/L or bulky 
lymphadenopathy and who are considered to be at ri sk for tumor lysis by [CONTACT_766319], e.g., allopurinol ≥ 300 mg/day orally or a suitable alternative 
treatment according to institutional practice starting 12 −[ADDRESS_1051197] be well hydrated prior to the initiation of study  treatment at Cycle 1, Day 1.  These patients 
should continue to receive repeated prophylaxis with allopurinol and adequate hydration prior to 
each subsequent infusion as deemed a ppropriate by [CONTACT_093].

  Bone Marro
w Toxicity /Neutropenia  
Based on preclinical toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and clinical data from the 
ongoing Phase I studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, neutropenia has been identified as a 
known risk (adverse drug reaction) of both DCDT2908S and DCDS4501A.  Neutropenia and 
neutropenia-associated events were reversib le but in some cases resulted in 
protocol-mandated dose reductions and/or delays.   
Adequate hematologic function should be confirme d before initiation of study treatment.  
Patients receiving study treatment will be regularly  monitored for evidence of marrow toxicity 
with complete blood counts.  Treatment for hematologic toxicities may be delayed or modified 
as described in Section 4.3.1.  
The use of G-CSF for neutropenia is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Transfusion support for 
anemia and thrombocytopenia is also permitted at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Immunogenicity 
As expected with any recombinant antibody , DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A may elicit an 
immune response and patients may develop antibodi es against DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  
Patients will be closely monitored for any potential immune response to DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A.  Appropriate screeni ng and confirmatory assays will be employed to detect ATAs 
at multiple timepoints before, during, and after treatment with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A.   
Considering the historically low immunogenicity ra te of rituximab in NHL patients, ATAs against 
rituximab will not be monitored in this study. 
Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy 
Based on clinical data from the ongoing Phase I studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g and data 
from brentuximab vedotin, an anti- CD30-vc-MMAE ADC (see Secti on 3.4.2) peripheral sensory 
neuropathy has been identified as a known risk ( adverse drug reaction) for both DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A. 
Patients should be monitored for signs of neur opathy or worsening neuropathy and appropriate 
action taken per protocol guidelines.  Study treatment dose and schedule modifications for 
significant and prolonged neuropathic toxi city and dose-reduction are described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
Reproductive Toxicity 
Adverse effects on human reproduction and fertilit y are anticipated with the administration of 
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A given the mechanis m of action of MMAE.  Standard exclusion 
criteria will be used to ensure that patients of  childbearing potential (male or female) are using 
adequate contraceptive methods.  
Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patien ts treated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A as 
well as with other antibody-drug conjug ates using the same vc-MMAE platform.  
Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holdin g or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs 
and/or initiation or adjustment of anti-hyperglycemic medications. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity is a potential risk  of the ADCs.  Definitive attrib ution of hepatoto xicity to the 
ADCs has not been established.  Transient dose-related increases in hepatic enzyme levels 
were observed in rats treated with DC DT2980S and DCDS4501A.  Elevations in 
transaminase and/or bilirubin levels requiring dose modifications have been reported in the 
ongoing clinical studies. 
 
Study Treatment  
DCDT2980S-Specific Information 
DCDT2980S will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_128192].  Compatibility testing has shown 
that DCDT2980S is stable when diluted in polyvi nyl chloride (PVC) bags to a concentration at or 
above 0.04 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl diluent.  The Drug Product will be delivered following dilution in 
0.9% NaCl with a final DCDT2980S concent ration determined based on dose and patient 
weight.  The study drug will be diluted in a PVC bag and delivered using a 0.22µm in-line filter 
on the IV infusion set.

  Additional informatio
n/instructions regarding study drug administration will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Binder. 
DCDS4501A-Specific Information 
DCDS4501A will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_766320] a 0.22 µm in-line filter with a final volume of DCDS4501A determined by [CONTACT_766321].  Compatibility testing has shown that DCDS4501A is stable in both 
syringes made of polypropylene (PP) and in st andard extension sets with 0.22 µm in-line 
filter, when stored neat or dilu ted with 0.9% NaCl saline.   
Additional information/instructions regarding study drug administration will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Binder. 
General Information 
The total dose of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A fo r each patient will depend on the patient’s 
weight within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of eac h cycle.  The patient weight obtained during 
screening may be used for dose determination at a ll treatment cycles; if the patient’s weight 
within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of a given treat ment cycle differs by >10% from the weight 
obtained during screening, then the new weight  should be used to calculate the dose.   
For both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, the initial dose will be administered to  well-hydrated 
(based on clinical judgment) patients over 90 ( ± 10) minutes.  Pre-medication with 
acetaminophen or paracetamol (e.g., 500–1000 mg) and diphenhydramine (e.g., 50–100 mg) 
per institutional standard practice may be administered prior to each infusion.  Administration of 
corticosteroids is permitted at the discretion of  the treating physician.  For patients who do not 
receive pre-medications prior to the first dose of DCDT2980S and who develop an infusion 
related reaction during the first dose should receive pre-medications prior to subsequent doses 
(see Table 1). 
The DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A infusion may be slowed or interrupted for patients experiencing 
infusion-associated symptoms.  Following t he initial dose, patients will be observed for 
90 minutes for fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, nausea, or other infusion-associated symptoms.  
If the infusion is well-tolerated, subsequent doses of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A may be administered over 30 ( ± 10) minutes, followed by a 30-minute observation period post-infusion.   
For further details, see Section 4.3 
Concomitant Therapy and Clinical Practice
 
Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medications or over-the-counter preparations 
used by a patient between the 7 days preceding the screening evaluation and the end of study 
visits.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the 
appropriate electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone- replacement therapy, or other maintenance 
therapy should continue their use.   Concomitant use of hematopoiet ic growth factors is allowed 
in accordance with instructions provided in the package inserts. Patients who experience infusion-rel ated temperature elevations of > 38.5°C (> 101.3°F) or 
other minor infusion-related symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen/paracetamol ( ≥ 500 mg) and/or H1 and H2 histamine-receptor antagonists 
(e.g., diphenhydramine, ranitidine).  Serious in fusion-related events m anifested by [CONTACT_27926], 
hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardi a, reduced oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_766171] (e.g., supplemental oxygen, 
β2-agonists, and/or corticosteroids) as clinically i ndicated according to standard clinical practice.   
Infusion reaction prophylaxis with medications (e.g., acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids) may be in stituted at any point in the study if it is 
determined to be in the best interest of the pati ent based on observation of IRRs in patients 
already enrolled in the study.  Patients with Grade [ADDRESS_1051198] be permanently discontinued 
from study treatment.

  Excluded Therapy
 
Use of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_27789]: 
• Cytotoxic chemotherapy 
• Radiotherapy 
• Immunotherapy including i mmunosuppressive therapy 
• Radioimmunotherapy 
• Hormone therapy (other than contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, or 
megestrol acetate) 
• Biologic agents (other than hematopoietic grow th factors, which are allowed if clinically 
indicated and used in accordance with inst ructions provided in the package inserts); 
guidelines for the use of G-CSF are detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix F. 
• Any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766131], whether approved by 
[CONTACT_766322].  Patients who are discontinued from study treatment will be followed for safety 
outcomes for 30 days following the patient’s last dose of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A or 
rituximab, whichever is later, or until the patient  receives another anti-cancer therapy whichever 
occurs first. 
Statistical Methods  
Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adv erse events, changes in laboratory test 
results, changes in physical findings on physical examinations, and changes in vital signs.  
All patients who receive any amount of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A or rituximab will be included 
in the safety analysis and will be assigned to the treatment group based on the study treatment 
received.   Patients who have dose level changes from the initial assigned dose level will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_766204]2980S or DCDS4501A.  
All adverse event data will be listed by [CONTACT_82385], patient number,  treatment group, 
disease-specific cohort, and cycle.  All adverse  events occurring on or after treatment on Day [ADDRESS_1051199]-baseline response 
assessment.  Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) as determined by [CONTACT_093], based on physical examinations, radiographic scans, 
and bone marrow examinations, using modified response criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007; 
see Appendix C), and confirmed by [CONTACT_294862] ≥ [ADDRESS_1051200] and/or MRI, and PET scans .  For patients with FL, primary assessment 
of response will be based on CT  scans only; the assessment of response in FL based on 
PET scans will be performed for exploratory purposes only. 
Among patients with an objective response, duration of response will be defined as the time 
from the initial CR or PR to the time of disease progression or death.  If a patient does not 
experience death or disease progression before t he end of the study, duration of response will 
be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
36/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
36/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  For the randomized portio
n of the study (Arms A and B), PFS is defined as the time from the 
date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death  from any cause , whichever 
occurs first.  If a patient has not experienced progressive disease or death, PFS will be 
censored at the day of the last tumor asse ssment.  Patients with no post-baseline tumor 
assessment will be censored on the date of randomization.   For the nonrandomized portion of 
the study (Cohorts C and D), PFS is defined as th e time from the date of study enrollment to 
the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), o verall survival is defined as the time 
from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.   For the nonrandomized 
portion of the study (Cohorts C and D), overall surv ival is defined as the time from the date of 
study enrollment to date of death from any cause. 
Missing Data  
For the endpoint of objective response, patient s without a post-baseline tumor assessment will 
be considered non-responders in the all-treated population analysis.  
For duration of response and PFS, data from pat ients who are lost to follow-up will be included 
in the analysis as censored observations on t he last date that the patient is known to be 
progression free, defined as the date of the last  tumor assessment, or, if no tumor assessments 
were performed, as the date of last study treatment plus 1 day. 
Compliance to PRO data collection will be re ported with summary statistics, including 
frequencies of reasons for non-compliance such as patient refusal to complete PRO data 
collection.   Determination of Sample Size   
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), a  target of 120 patients will be 
enrolled in two separate cohorts of patients (40 in the follicular NHL cohort and 80 in the DLBCL 
cohort).  Genentech has judged this sample size to provide sufficient precision in estimating the 
anti-tumor activity of DCDT2980S combined wi th rituximab or DCDS4501A combined with 
rituximab as measured by [CONTACT_33966].  For example, with the assumption of an 
observed response rate of 40%, a 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be approximately 22%− 58% (i.e., 40% ± 18%) for the follicular NHL cohort and approximately 
27%−53% (i.e., 40% ± 13%) for the DLBCL cohort. 
This is a non-comparative hypothesis-generating st udy.  There is no formal hypothesis testing 
planned to compare the treatment arms .  Specifically, for the randomized portion of the study,  
there is insufficient power to detect minimum c linically meaningful differences between the two 
treatment arms.

  1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON DISEASE  
B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders are a heterogeneous group of malignancies,  ranging 
from slow-growing indolent and incurable diseases with a median survival of 8 −10 years 
(such as follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL ]) to more aggressive intermediate- to 
high-grade lymphomas (such as diffuse large-cell lymphoma), which can have a median 
survival of 6 months if left untreated or l ong-term remission in more than 50% of patients 
with appropriate treatment.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL accounting for approximately 30% −40% of all new patients, whereas 
follicular lymphoma (FL) accounts for approximately 20% −25% of new lymphomas, 
respectively.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_766119]20-specific monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan
®, MabThera®) in combination 
with chemotherapy, indolent B-cell malignancies remain incurable as are approximately half of aggressive NHL patients.  Thus, there is still a need for treatments that can be combined with chemoimmunotherapy and can significantly extend disease-free and 
overall survival in these patients, with at least acceptable, if not superior, safety profiles. 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON THE MOLECULES 
1.2.1 DCDT2980S  
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Preclinical Data 
CD22 is a cell-surface antigen whose expression is restricted to all mature B cells except plasma cells.  It is expressed in a majority of the B-cell −derived malignancies, including 
nearly all NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukem ia (CLL) samples tested (see Figure 1).  
Antibodies bound to CD22 are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570580], making CD22 ideally suited for targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents (Shan and Press 1995).   
DCDT2980S is an antibody −drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of a potent anti-mitotic 
agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) c onjugated to a humanized immunoglobulin-G1 
(IgGI) anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody, MCDT2219A, via a protease-labile linker, 
maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-am inobenzoyloxycarbonyl (MC-VC-PABC).  
MMAE has a mode of action similar to vincristine, which is a component of standard chemotherapy used in lymphoma therapy.  This therapeutic approach takes advantage 
of the specific targeting capability of the antibody and the cytotoxic activity of MMAE.  Following internalization, the MMAE is deconjugated from DCDT2980S by [CONTACT_570622], binds to tubulin and disrupts the microtubule network, resulting in inhibition of cell division and cell growth and induction of apoptosis (Doronina et al. 2003).

CD22 expression levels (MFI) on B-cell tumor cells were assessed by [CONTACT_766208] B-cell lymphomas:  CLL (n  = 49), DLBCL (n  = 59), FL (n  = 58), 
MCL (n  = 20), and MZL (n  = 60).  
 
Comprehensive pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and 
toxicology evaluations were conducted to support the use of DCDT2980S in clinical trials.  DCDT2980S binds human CD22 with a high affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant [K
d] = 1.7  ± 0.2 nM) and showed similar binding a ffinity to cynomolgus monkey 
CD22.  No binding activity was observed with mouse and rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).   
The unconjugated antibody MCDT2219A did not appear to induce antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complem ent-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in vitro.  
In contrast, DCDT2980S displayed potent and selective inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro (50% of the maximal inhibitory concentration [IC
50] = 0.33 nM) by [CONTACT_766209].  Efficacy studies conducted in murine xenograft models of human lymphoma 
(CD22-positive WSU-DLCL2 and BJAB cell lines) showed that a single dose of DCDT2980S resulted in regression of tumor growth at doses ranging from 1 to 4 mg/kg.  PD studies with DCDT2980S showed that a single dose of 1 −6 mg/kg resulted in partial 
depletion of peripheral blood B-cells in cynomolgus monkeys with a corresponding depletion in germinal center B-cells in lymphoid tissue. 
The PK profiles of DCDT2980S were observed to be linear in rodents and moderately 
non-linear in cynomolgus monkeys over the tested dose range.  The non-linear

  clearance (CL) observed in cynomolgus monk eys with DCDT2980S is likely due to the 
contribution of B-cell-mediated CL to the total clearance.  The free MMAE concentrations 
in cynomolgus monkeys following DCDT2980S administration were generally [ADDRESS_1051204] relevant nonclinical species for the 
toxicology and PK/PD studies of DCDT2980S, given the comparable sequence homology of human and cynomolgus monkey CD22, similar binding affinity of DCDT2980S to human and cynomolgus monk ey CD22, and comparable tissue 
cross-reactivity in both human and cynomol gus monkey tissues.  DCDT2980S was well 
tolerated at doses of up to 3 mg/kg (highest non-severely toxic dose [HNSTD]) in monkeys, and up to or greater than 10 mg/kg in rats (severely toxic dose to 10% of rats [STD
10] ≥ 10 mg/kg).  Reversible bone marrow toxicity and associated hematopoietic 
changes were observed in both rats and m onkeys treated with DCDT2980S or MMAE, 
suggesting that the toxicity of DCDT2980S is related to MMAE.  Additional effects on liver and lung in rats were minimal in severity and reversible, and did not occur in cynomolgus monkeys, which may be due to differ ences in species sensitivity, exposure, 
and/or pharmacokinetics.

[IP_ADDRESS] DCDT2980S Clinical Data 
a. Patient Enrollment 
Both DCDT2980S monotherapy and combination therapy with rituximab have been 
studied in a Phase I study (DCT4862g) of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies expected to express CD22, including indolent NHL, DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and CLL. 
All data presented herein is based on a data entry cutoff of 22 February 2013 , with 
clinical data available from 65 patients with NHL (excluding patients with CLL) enrolled 
in dose-escalation and expansion cohorts.  These include 49 patients who were treated 
with single-agent DCDT2980S at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg administered 
intravenously every 21 days, and 16 patients who were enrolled into two Phase Ib 
cohorts with DCDT2980S administered at doses of 1.8 mg/kg (5 patients) and 2.4 mg/kg (11 patients) in combination with 375 mg/m
[ADDRESS_1051205] been c haracterized in the Phase I Study 
DCT4862g.  DCDT2980S was administered to patients with NHL at dose levels ranging 
43/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
43/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  from 0.1 to 3.2 mg/kg every-3-weeks (q3w).  Three analytes were quantified: 
antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), total antibody, and free MMAE.  
Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis based on available data as of 22 June 2012 is 
summarized below.   
The mean value of CL estimates of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level for 
doses of ≥ 1.0 mg/kg ranged from 17.6 to 21.3 mL/day/kg and from 10.5 to 
16.2 mL/day/kg, respectively.  Similar CL estimates for doses ≥ 1.0 mg/kg suggested 
dose proportional increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposure.  CL estimates appeared to be slightly higher at doses < 1.0 mg/kg (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg), although data from these dose levels is limited.  The CL of acMMAE was faster than total antibody at each dose level.   
In patients with NHL, the mean value of the volume of distribution (V
ss) of acMMAE and 
total antibody of each dose level ranged from 69.2 to 130 mL/kg and from 97.4 to 
154 mL/kg, respectively, across the dose levels tested, approximating human serum volume.  V
ss values did not appear to change substantially with dose.  The half-life for 
acMMAE and total antibody ranged from 2.9 to 7.0 days and from 4.4 to 13 days, respectively.   
For acMMAE and total antibody, the time to maximum concentration occurred 
immediately after infusion.  For free MMAE, the time to maximum concentration was approximately 2 to 3 days after infusion. C
max and AUC inf of free MMAE appeared to 
increase with dose across the dose levels tested.  A half-life of 3–[ADDRESS_1051206] elimination once it is formed.    
Preliminary comparisons of PK between patients with NHL and CLL (for which patients 
are enrolled into separate dose-escalation cohorts) treated with identical doses of DCDT2980S provide some insight into the factors that affect PK.  Both acMMAE and total antibody were cleared faster in CLL patients than in NHL patients.  This observation is likely to be related to the high number of  circulating B cells generally observed in CLL 
patients, which may result in significant target-mediated clearance of DCDT2980S.  The free MMAE exposure in CLL patients was relatively low compared to its parent conjugate.   
The exposure parameters (C
max and AUC inf) of total antibody, acMMAE and free MMAE 
were similar between DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S + rituximab at doses of 1.8 and 
2.4 mg/kg, based on preliminary data.  This observation suggests that, when given in 
44/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
44/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051207] the PK of DCDT2980S; the effect of 
DCDT2980S on rituximab PK will be assessed.   
All observations will be verified with additional data from the ongoing Phase I study as 
well as this study.

c. Safety 
Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Study DCT4862g utilizes a standard 3+[ADDRESS_1051208] been 
observed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1051209] dose of DCDT2980S.  Any patient who did not complete the DLT observation period for any reason other than a DLT was replaced. 
Separate dose-escalation cohorts enrolled patients with B-cell NHL and CLL.  For the 
NHL dose escalation, DLTs of Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient out of 3 DLT-evaluable patients in the 3.2 mg/kg single agent cohort and 1 patient out of 
11 DLT-evaluable patients in the 2.4 mg/kg + rituximab cohort.  Consequently, 
DCDT2980S at 2.4 mg/kg was determined to be the recommended Phase II dose 
(RP2D) as both monotherapy and in combination with rituximab.   
For the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, one DLT was reported  to date .  This Grade 5 event 
of febrile neutropenia resulted in the patient’s death.  While the contribution of the study 
drug to the neutropenia could not be completely ruled out, other factors, including bone marrow involvement of disease that resulted in baseline anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and clinical evidence of disease progression may have also played a contributory role. 
Single-Agent DCDT2980S and DCDT2980S Combined wi th Rituximab in NHL  
Forty-nine patients receiv ed single-agent DCDT2980S at a starting dose of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg 
(7 at 1.8 mg/kg, 42 at 2.4 mg/kg); 16 patien ts received DCDT2980S at a starting dose 
of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg in combination with rituximab (5 at 1.8 mg/kg, 11 at 2.4 mg/kg).  
Overall the safety pro file of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab did no t differ from 
that of single-agent DCDT2980S. 
Treatment emergent hematologic and commonly reported nonhematologic adverse 
events for all grades in patients tr eated with single-agent DCDT2980S and 
DCDT2980S plus rituximab included neutro penia (29%), febril e neutropenia (3%), 
infection (system organ class; 43%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (12%), peripheral neuropathy (28%), diarrhea ( 40%), pyrexia (14%), nausea (34%), and 
fatigue (55%).  Treatment emergent Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included neutropenia 
(25%), febrile neutropenia (3%), infection (system organ class; 11%), anemia (5%),

  peripheral neuropathy (3%), diarrhea (5%), pyrexia (2%), and fatigue (3%).  Serious 
adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_766210]2980S were reported in 21% of patients.  Dose discontinuations for adverse events were reported in 20% of patients.

d. Efficacy  in Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
Investigator-based objective responses were ob served in 17 of 43 (40% ) patients treated 
with single-agent DCDT2980S and 5 of 15  (33%) patients treated with DCDT2980S 
combined with rituximab.  Among patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, 11 of 28 
(39%) objective responses (5 complete responses [CR] and 6 partial responses [PR]) were observed with single-agent DCDT2980 S and 3 of 7 (43%; 2 CR, 1 PR) with 
DCDT2980S combined with rituximab.  Am ong patients with relapsed/refractory 
indolent (iNHL), 6 of 13 (46%) objective responses (2 CR, 4 PR) were observed with 
single-agent DCDT2980S and 1 of 4 (PR) with 
DCDT2980S combined wi th rituximab.

1.2.2 DCDS4501A  
[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Preclinical Data 
CD79b is a cell-surface antigen whose expression is restricted to all mature 
B cells except plasma cells.  It is expressed in a majority of B-cell −derived malignancies, 
including nearly all NHL and CLL samples tested (see Figure 2) (Dornan et al. 2009).  Antibodies bound to CD79b are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570580], making CD79b ideally suited for targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents (Polson 2007; 2009).   
Similar to DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A is an ADC that contains a humanized 
immunoglobulin-G1 (IgG1) anti −human CD79b monoclonal antibody (MCDS4409A) and 
MMAE linked through MC-VC-PABC.   
Comprehensive pharmacologic, PK, PD, and toxicological evaluations were undertaken to 
support the entry of DCDS4501A into clinical  trials.  Because DCDS4501A specifically 
recognizes CD79b on B cells of human but not on those of cynomolgus monkey, rat, or 
mouse, a surrogate ADC (DCDS5017A) that binds to cynomolgus monkey CD79b was generated to assess the antigen-dependent pharmacological, toxicological and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic activities in cynomolgus monkeys.  The structure, binding epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], and binding affinity of the surrogate ADC are similar to DCDS4501A.

  Figure 2 CD79b Expression Levels on B-Cell Tumor Cells 
 
CLL  = chronic lymphocytic leukemia; DLBCL  = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 
FL  = follicular lymphoma; MCL  = mantle cell lymphoma; MZL  = marginal zone lymphoma.  
CD79b expression levels (MFI, mean fluorescence intensity) on B-cell tumor cells were assessed 
by [CONTACT_766323] B-cell lymphomas:  CLL (n  = 49), 
DLBCL (n  = 59), FL (n  = 58), MCL (n  = 20), and MZL (n  = 60). 
 
DCDS4501A bound human CD79b with high affinity (K d = 1.83± 0.26 nM); the surrogate 
ADC also showed similar high binding affinity to cynomolgus monkey CD79b.  
DCDS4501A displayed potent and selective inhibiti on of tumor cell proliferation in vitro 
(IC50 = 0.071 nM  ± 0.01 nM) in cell viability assays.  Moderate ADCC but no CDC activity 
was observed with the unconjugated clinical candidate antibody MCDS4409A.  Both clinical and surrogate unconjugated antibodies showed no appreciable cytokine release when evaluated in in vitro cytokine release assays with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  Moderate elevations in IL-1 α and IP-10 were observed only with the 
unconjugated clinical antibody, however the clinical significance of these observations are not known since IL-1 α and IP-10 are not produced by B-cells, are not involved in 
B-cell signaling through CD79b, and are not associated with cytokine-release syndromes in vivo. 
Single intravenous (IV) doses of DCDS4501A resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in 
murine xenograft models of lymphoma.  Tumor regression was observed at doses 
ranging from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg.  In contrast, MCDS4409A showed no activity.  DCDS4501A administered at 5 mg/kg demonstrated better anti-tumor activity compared to a current standard-of-care regimen (rituximab plus cy clophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
and prednisone [R-CHOP]) in xenograft models of  NHL.  PD studies demonstrated that 
at doses of the surrogate ADC ranging from 0.3 to 5 mg/kg resulted in a decrease of peripheral-blood B cells in cynomolgus monkeys.   A preferential decrease of proliferating

  B-cells (CD20 + Ki67 +) compared to the resting B cells (CD20 + Ki67−) by [CONTACT_766211],  in line with the expected mechanism of 
action of an anti-mitotic agent, MMAE. 
Due to B-cell-mediated CL, non-linear pharmacokinetics were observed with the 
surrogate ADC in cynomolgus monkeys following single IV doses of 0.3 −3 mg/kg or four 
doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg given q3w.  The total antibody exposure after the fourth dose increased approximately 1.2- to 1.5-fold compared
 to the first dose.  As expected, the 
toxicokinetic profile of the clinical ADC in rats and cynomolgus monkeys was linear in the tested dose range.  Consistent with the half-life of the clinical ADC, minimal accumulation was observed following weekly dosing in rats and no accumulation was observed following every-3-week dosing in cynomolgus monkeys.  The free MMAE concentrations in plasma following administration of the clinical or surrogate ADCs were generally low and overall did not exceed 2 ng/mL, regardless of dose.  The overall incidence of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) was 20% −67% following administration 
of the clinical or surrogate ADCs in cynom olgus monkeys; however, the ATAs did not 
appear to impact the toxicokinetic/pharmacokinetic parameter estimates. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in ra ts and cynomolgus monkeys, DCDS4501A and 
the surrogate ADC were well tolerated in monkeys up to 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg 
respectively, with 3 mg/kg considered the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD).  In rats, DCDS4501A was well tolerated up to 6 mg/kg (STD
10 = 10 mg/kg).  
The predominant antigen-independent findings associated with DCDS4501A or surrogate ADC exposure were reversible bone marrow toxicity and associated peripheral blood cell effects in both monkeys and rats.  Administration of the surrogate ADC to monkeys also resulted in expected antigen-dependent reversible decreases in peripheral blood B cells and the disappearance of B-cell germinal centers in splenic lymphoid 
follicles at doses ≥
 3 mg/kg.  Additional findings observed in rats but not in monkeys 
included thymic lymphoid depletion at ≥ 6 mg/kg, minimal to mild liver toxicities (at 
≥ 6 mg/kg), lung toxicities at 10 mg/kg in male animals only, and a slight increase in 
apoptosis and mitoses in multiple tissues, including skin and adnexa.  Hepatobiliary toxicity consisted of transient dose-dependent liver enzyme elevations accompanied by [CONTACT_766282]-dependent increases in mitotic figures/apoptosis in hepatocytes, sinusoidal cells, and bile duct epi[INVESTIGATOR_766120]-dependent random focal hepatic necrosis.  Pulmonary toxicity was characterized by [CONTACT_766282]-dependent alveolar macrophage infiltration, sometimes accompanied by [CONTACT_766324]/hypertrophy.  These findings were 
consistent with the expected pharmacologic e ffect of MMAE on inducing mitotic arrest 
due to inhibition of tubulin polymerization.  Except for two individual instances (one female given 10 mg/kg in the liver and one male given 10 mg/kg in the lung), these findings were completely reversible after a 6-week recovery period.  Non-reversible male reproductive toxicity, characterized by [CONTACT_766214], was observed in rats at all doses.

[IP_ADDRESS] DCDS4501A Clinical Data 
a. Patient Enrollment 
Both DCDS4501A monotherapy and combination therapy with rituximab are being 
studied in a Phase I study (DCS4968g) of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies expected to express CD79b, including indolent NHL, DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and CLL.   
All data presented herein is based on a data entry cutoff of 28 February 2013 , with 
clinical data available from 60 patients with NHL (excluding patients with CLL) enrolled 
in dose-escalation and expansion cohorts.  These include 51 patients who were treated 
with single-agent DCDS4501A ranging from 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg administered intravenously 
every 21 days, and 9  patients who were enrolled into a single Phase Ib cohort with 
DCDS4501A administered at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg in combination with 375 mg/m
2 
rituximab. 
In the CLL dose escalation cohorts, two DLTs were reported at the single-agent dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.  Enrollment into the CLL co horts was stopped on 7 January 2013.   Refer to 
the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure for details regarding clinical data in CLL patients.   
b. Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of DCDS4501A were characterized in a Phase I study DCDS4501A.  DCDS4501A was administered in patients with NHL at escalating doses of 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg q3w as monotherapy and following administration of rituximab in the Phase Ib cohort.  Three analytes were quantified: antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), total antibody, and free MMAE.  
Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis based on available data as of 22 June 2012 is 
summarized below.  The CL estimates of acMMAE and total antibody of each dose level 
is in the range of 14.9–21.2 mL/day/kg and 7.12 to 27.9 mL/day/kg, respectively.  CL estimates were similar across doses of 0.1–2.4 mg/kg tested, suggesting dose 
proportional increase of acMMAE and total antibody exposure.  The clearance of 
acMMAE was faster than total antibody at each dose level.   
The mean value of the volume of distribution (V
ss) of acMMAE and total antibody of each 
dose level ranged from 61 to 80.8 mL/kg and from 59.4 to 114.3 mL/kg, respectively, 
across the dose levels tested, which approximated human serum volume. V ss values did 
not appear to change substantially with dose. The half-lives for acMMAE and total antibody are from 2.4 to 5.5 days and 2.9 to 7 days, respectively.  
In a single agent dose-escalation study, for acMMAE and total antibody, the time to 
maximum concentration occurred immediately after infusion.  For free MMAE, the time to maximum concentration was approximately 2 to 3 days after infusion.  C
max and AUC inf of 
free MMAE appear increased with dose across the dose levels.  A half-life of 3–4 days 
49/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
49/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051210] elimination once it is formed.   
Preliminary comparisons of PK between patients with NHL and CLL (for which patients 
are enrolled into separate dose-escalation cohorts) treated with identical doses of DCDS4501A provide some insight into the factors that affect PK.  Both acMMAE and total antibody were cleared faster in CLL patients than in NHL patients.  This observation is likely to be related to the high number of  circulating B cells generally observed in CLL 
patients, which may result in significant target-mediated clearance of DCDS4501A.  The free MMAE exposure in CLL patients was relatively low compared to its parent conjugate. 
To date, PK data for patients treated with DCDS4501A in combination with rituximab is 
limited.  Consequently, full comparison with single-agent DCDS4501A PK is not possible.  Based on very limited data from 3 patients, total antibody PK was comparable between 2.4 mg/kg of DCDS4501A administered as single-agent and following rituximab 
administration, suggesting that when given in co mbination, rituximab does not affect the 
PK of DCDS4501A; the effect of DCDS4501A on rituximab PK will be assessed.   
All observations will be verified with additional data from the ongoing Phase I study as 
well as this study. 
Refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure for complete and updated details. 
c. Safety 
Dose-Limiting Toxicities  
Study DCS4968g utilizes a standard 3+[ADDRESS_1051211] dose of DCDS4501A.  Any patient who did not complete the DLT observation period for any reason other than a DLT was replaced. 
DLT of Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient out of 10 DLT-evaluable patients in the 
2.4 mg/kg single agent cohort and 1 patient out of 9 DLT-evaluable patients in the 
2.4 mg/kg + rituximab cohort.  Doses of DCDS4501A greater than 2.4 mg/kg as 
monotherapy or in combination with ritu ximab were not assessed.  Consequently, 
DCDS4501A at 2.4 mg/kg was therefore determined to be the RP2D as both monotherapy and in combination with rituximab.  Patients are currently being enrolled in monotherapy expansion cohorts for various types  of NHL in order to collect and further 
characterize both single agent and combination safety data.

50/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  In the CLL dose-escalation cohorts, two DLTs were reported at the single-agent dose of 
1.8 mg/kg.  One patient had a Grade 4 neutropenia, and 1 patient had a Grade 4 invasive fungal infection.   
Single-Agent DCDS4501A and DCDS4501A Combined with Rituximab
 
Fifty-one patients received single agent DCDS4501A at a starting dose of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg 
(6 at 1.8 mg/kg, 45 at 2.4 mg/kg); an addi tional 9 patients re ceived DCDS4501A at a 
dose of 2.4 mg/kg in combination with rituximab.  Overall, the safety profile of DCDS4501A combined with rituximab did no t differ from that of single-agent 
DCDS4501A. 
Treatment emergent hematologic and commonly reported non-hematologic adverse 
events for all grades in patients tr eated with single-agent DCDS4501A and 
DCDS4501A plus rituximab included neutro penia (50%), febril e neutropenia (5%), 
infection (system organ class; 35%), anemia (13%), thrombocytopenia (18%), peripheral neuropathy (32%), diarrhea ( 43%), pyrexia (37%), nausea (35%), and 
fatigue (18%).  Treatment emergent Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included neutropenia 
(43%), febrile neutropenia (5%), infection (system organ class; 10%), anemia (8%), 
peripheral neuropathy (7%), diarrhea (3%), pyrexia (2%), and fatigue (5%).  Serious adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_766215]4501A were reported in 20% of patients.  Dose discontinuations for adverse events were reported in 33% of patients. 
Refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator’s Broc hure for complete and updated details 
related to safety.   
d. Efficacy 
Investigator-based objective responses were ob served in 28 of 49 (57% ) patients treated 
with single-agent DCDS4501A and 7 of 9 patients (78%) treated with DCDS4501A 
combined with rituximab.  Among patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, objective 
responses were observed in 16 of 30 (53%; 4 CR, 12 PR) patients treated with DCDS4501A; 1 patient with DLBCL was tr eated with DCDS4501A combined with 
rituximab and achieved a PR.  Among patients with relapsed/refractory iNHL, objective responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%; 2 CR, 5 PR) patients treated with single-agent DCDS4501A and 5 of 5 (100% ; 2 CR, 3 PR) patients treated with 
DCDS4501A plus rituximab.  
Refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure for complete and updated details 
regarding anti-tumor activity. 
1.2.3 Rituximab  
Rituximab has been shown to be an effective treatment for CD20-positive B-cell malignancies and is commonly used both as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Rituximab binds  to CD20, a hydrophobic, transmembrane

  protein that is present on pre–B and mature B cells and in > 90% of B-cell NHLs.  
It exerts its cytotoxic effects via complem ent-mediated B-cell lysis, ADCC, and induction 
of apoptosis (Cartron et al. 2004). 
In the [LOCATION_002], rituximab has been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the following indications in NHL: as a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive B-cell NHL; for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive B-cell NHL, including initia l treatment weekly for eight doses and 
re-treatment (weekly for four doses) in patients who responded to an initial course of rituximab; for the treatment of low-grade, CD20-positive B-cell NHL, in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) induction chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with follicular, CD20-positive NHL; as treatment in previously untreated patients with low- grade, CD20-positive NHL who achieve an 
objective response or stable disease (SD) following CVP induction; as maintenance therapy for previously untreated follicular CD20-positive B-cell NHL after achieving a 
response to a regimen including chemotherapy and rituximab. 
In the European Union, rituximab (MabThera
®) is approved for the treatment of the 
following indications in NHL: treatment of patients with Stage III–IV follicular NHL who 
are chemotherapy-resistant or in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy; treatment of patients with CD20-positive DLBCL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy; as front-line therapy in Stage III–IV follicular NHL in combination with CVP chemotherapy; as maintenance therapy in patient s with relapsed or refractory, follicular 
NHL responding to induction treatment with CHOP or rituximab
 + CHOP; and as 
maintenance treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma who have responded to initial treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy. 
Rituximab has also been approved for the treatment of CLL.  The European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) granted an approval for the use of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated CLL.  The FDA approved the use of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for patients with previously untreated and previously treated CD20-positive CLL.

details regarding clinical data related to approved indications.  For rituximab safety information, refer to local rituximab prescribing information. 
1.3 RATIONALE FOR DOING THIS STUDY 
The goals of this Phase II study are to continue to assess the safety, tolerability, and biologic and clinical activity of the combinations of DCDT2980S and rituximab and DCDS4501A and rituximab in two specific NHL patient populations:  patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL, and patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.  
52/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
52/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051212] an extremely poor prognosis with no curative options 
available.  Consequently new therapeutic options are needed.   
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A and rituximab each target antigens specific to B-cell 
malignancies including follicular NHL and DLBCL (see Figures 1 and 2).  
The Phase II study design permits an assessm ent of the clinical benefit provided by 
[CONTACT_766220], which has established clinical 
activity in B-cell malignancies both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy.  Data from this study will hel p inform the feasibility of the combination 
regimens in earlier lines of therapy (e.g., as first-line therapy in newly diagnosed patients). 
The feasibility of combining an ADC with ritu ximab has previously been tested clinically 
with the combination of another, different CD22-specific ADC, inotuzumab ozogamicin 
(CMC-544), with results suggesting that the addition of rituximab may have increased 
clinical activity without significant increase in toxicity over the ADC alone in patients with aggressive NHL (Luis et al. 2006; Nam  et al. 2009; Nina et al. 2010).  As noted in 
Sections 1.2.[ADDRESS_1051213] acceptable safety in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL in the Phase I studies (DCT4862g and DCS4968g).   
Given the relatively poor prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic 
malignancies that have failed standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_766172]2980S and DCDS4501A treatm ent, and the clinical safety profile 
observed to date for both ADCs, the risk-benefit ratio of a clinical study of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, each combined with rituximab, is considered acceptable.   
1.3.1 Rationale for Assessing ADC Do se of 1.8 mg/kg Combined 
with Rituximab in iNHL  
Based on available Phase I data (see Se ction 1.2.1 and 1.2.2), both DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A as single-agents and combined with rituximab ha ve shown early signs of 
clinical activity in heavily pretreated patien ts with relapsed/refractory NHL.  However, 
early evidence in the Phase I studies indicate that duration of study treatment may be limited by [CONTACT_766221].  Specific ally, for both ADCs, peripheral sensory 
neuropathy has been identified as a known risk (see Section 3.4.2).  Notably, [ADDRESS_1051214] shown single-a gent activity at the 1.8 mg/kg dose 
level (Advani et al. 2012; Palanca-Wess els et al. 2012), the purpose of enrolling 
additional cohorts of patients with follicul ar lymphoma is to determine whether lower

53/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051215] to iNHL, treatment paradigms in  relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas 
such as DLBCL continue to place a premium on anti-tumor activity and higher 
tolerance for treatment-related toxicity gi ven that durations of disease control and 
survival are substantially shorter and that treatment options are extremely limited.  Early Phase I data suggest lower rates of study treatment discontinuation for adverse events among patients with DLBCL compared with patients with iNHL.  Taken together with anti-tumor activity observed to date, the risk-benefit profile of the currently tested ADC dose of 2.4 mg/kg is considered acceptable

No formal testing comparing the two treatment arms in the randomized portion of the study is planned. 
3.1.2 Nonrandomized Portion of the Study (Cohorts C and D)  
Only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the nonrandomized portion of the study will enroll patients into these cohorts. 
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled in Cohorts C and D 
to receive rituximab (375 mg/m
2) combined with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A at a 
dose of 1.8 mg/kg.  The first day of treatment constitutes Day 1 of each cycle.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_766116] 21 days in duration. 
The opening of either or both cohorts will be at the Sponsor’s discretion and only after 
the enrollment of follicular lymphoma patients into the randomized portion of the study is completed.  Patients will not be randomized to receive one treatment or the other.  It is anticipated that Cohort C and D will be opened sequentially.   
3.1.3 All Patients  
All patients, regardless of assigned arm/cohort will receive DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A 
and rituximab administered by [CONTACT_766203] a 21-day cycle.  For the first two cycles, 
rituximab will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 1 and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 2.  In the absence of any infusion-related adverse events, rituximab and DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent cycles beginning with the third cycle.  In this instance, 
rituximab will be administered first, followed by [CONTACT_766191]2980S or DCDS4501A.  In certain circumstances, e.g., infusion-related reactions requiring interruption or slowing of infusion rate, rituximab may be administered over 2 days, e.g., Day 1 and Day 2 of the cycle; in this case, DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be administered on Day 2 following completion of the rituximab infusion or on Day 3 of the cycle. 
Patients may receive treatments for up to 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day 
schedule) if not discontinued due to signific ant toxicity, disease progression, or 
withdrawal from study.

57/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules 
of assessments outlined in Appendices A-1, A-2, and A-3.  Initial response assessments in this study will be performed every 3 months  from the initiation of therapy until study 
treatment completion or early termination (e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1051222] eight  21-day cycles of treatment).  Additional 
response assessments for patients who proceed to crossover treatment (see Section 3.1.3) will be performed as described in Appendix A-2; response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment (both initially assigned treatment and crossover treatment) for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as described in Appendix A-3. 
Responses to study treatment will be based on investigator assessments.  In addition, 
tumor assessment data will be transmitted to an Independent Review Facility (IRF) for collection and possible independent review. 
3.1.4 Follicular NHL Cohort  
Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular NHL will be enrolled into the study as defined by [CONTACT_716]: 
• Relapsed
 to regimens containing rituximab, defined as documented history of 
response (CR, CRu, or PR) of ≥ 6 months in duration from completion of all prior  
rituximab-containing regimens.  A rituxi mab-containing regimen is defined as 
rituximab as a single agent during induction and/or maintenance, or in combination 
with other agents during induction and/or maintenance. 
• Refractory  to any prior  regimen containing rituximab, defined as no response to, or 
progression within [ADDRESS_1051223] dose of rituximab therapy 
(either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy), including: 
Patients with progressive disease while receiving rituximab monotherapy, 
rituximab combined with chemotherapy, or rituximab maintenance therapy; 
patients must have received at least one full dose (375 mg/m2) of rituximab 
Patients with no objective response (PR or CR) to a rituximab-containing regimen 
consisting of at least [ADDRESS_1051224] 4 cycles of rituximab
 combined with  chemotherapy 
Enrollment of patients with refractory disease as defined above may be limited to no greater than 60% of the total follicular NHL cohort, in order to avoid overrepresentation of the refractory disease population. 
58/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
58/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  3.1.5 DLBCL Cohort  
Patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are determined by [CONTACT_766316]/stem cell transplant (SCT) as determined by [CONTACT_766317]: 
• Second-line SCT-ineligible patients with progressive disease or no response 
(SD) <
 12 months from start of initial therapy (2L refractory ) 
• Second-line SCT-ineligible patients with disease relapse after initial response 
≥ 12 months from start of initial therapy (2L relapsed ) 
• Third-line (or beyond) SCT-ineligible patients with progressive disease or no 
response (SD) < 6 months from start of prior therapy (3L  + refractory ) 
• Third-line (or beyond) SCT-ineligible patients with disease relapse after initial 
response ≥  6 months from start of prior therapy (3L+ relapsed ) 
 
Enrollment to any of the above four categories may be limited to no greater than 40% of 
the DLBCL cohort—and to no more than 60% of the two refractory categories combined—in order to avoid overrepresentation of any specific subpopulation, refractory patients in particular. 
3.1.6 Crossover Treatment  (Randomized Patients Only)  
Patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B who develop progressive disease may be 
eligible to receive crossover treatment consisting of rituximab and the other ADC, or the other ADC alone, e.g., Arm B treatment for patients who have disease progression while receiving Arm A treatment and vice versa, provided the following conditions are met: 
• Patients must not have experienced a toxicity requiring the discontinuation of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment OR experienced toxicity during the last dose of 
study treatment that would preclude treatment with the crossover regimen. 
Patients who had modifications to dosing and/or schedule on the initial study 
treatment will be permitted to receive crossover treatment in the absence of toxicities on the modified dose and/or schedule.  The dose and schedule of crossover treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_33495]. 
Patients who had rituximab discontinued and continued on single-agent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A treatment may receive crossover treatment of single-agent DCDS4501A/ DCDT2980S  
• Patients must have radiographically documented disease progression 
• Patients must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Sections 4.1.1 
and 4.1.2, except for those related to prior rituximab treatment.

59/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  • Acceptable toxicity:  All study drug–relat ed adverse events from the initial study 
treatment must have decreased to Grade [ADDRESS_1051225] 
day of treatment on the crossover regimen.  Exceptions may be allowed after a 
careful assessment and discussion of the risk-benefit balance with the patient by [CONTACT_766224]. 
• Administration of crossover treatment must be in the best interests of the patient 
as determined after a careful assessment and discussion of risk-benefit balance 
with the patient by [CONTACT_766224]. 
• A tumor biopsy (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will be required for patients with safely 
accessible site of disease, defined as requiring only local anesthesia and in general 
excluding brain, lungs or any internal organs that may subject patients to significant risk.  
Patients for whom a safely accessible site of disease is not present may still 
receive crossover treatment without undergoi ng a biopsy.  Eligibility to receive 
crossover treatment should be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_22955]. 
A tumor biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease is optional for patients who 
are not eligible for study cross over.  
Patients who are determined to be eligible for study crossover will be treated as follows: 
• Assessments obtained at the initial study treatment discontinuation visit 
(see Section 4.5.4) may be used as screening assessments for crossover treatment.  
The following re-screening assessments must be repeated/obtained within 1 week 
prior to starting treatment on the crossover regimen in order to re-establish baseline pretreatment clinical and disease status:  targeted physical exam, ECOG status and 
hematology and serum chemistry laboratories. 
Re-screening tests for Hepatitis B and C do not need to be performed unless 
there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_766169] B and/or C positivity. 
A radiographic tumor assessment must also be performed, unless already done 
to document disease progression, within 6 weeks prior to starting crossover 
treatment. 
• Crossover treatment will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1051226] dose of the prior 
study treatment. 
Patients will be treated with the crossover treatment until a second disease progression 
event relative to the tumor assessment documenting progressive disease on the initial study treatment, clinical deterioration and/or intolerance to the crossover treatment for up to a maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule).  Patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules of assessments outlined in Appendices A-2.  Response assessments for patients who discontinue study treatment 
for reasons other than disease progression will be performed as described in Appendix A-3.

• The incidence or severity of adverse events during crossover treatment indicates a 
potential safety hazard to patients. 
• Patient enrollment into crossover treatment is unsatisfactory. 
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.  
• Patients who are enrolled into the nonran domized portion of the study (Cohorts C 
and D) will not have the option to receive crossover treatment upon disease 
progression (see Section 3.2 for rationale). 
 
3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
The primary rationale for the randomized non-comparative portion of the study is to 
assess clinical activity for the ADCs DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A in patients with 
relapsed/refractory NHL.  The study design ensures that the patient populations under study are balanced with respect to critical variables such as prior therapy and ensures consistent clinical assessment of safety and efficacy.  The collection and assessment of 
tumor tissue obtained prior to first study treatment and following progressive disease will provide further understanding of disease biology, possible mechanisms of resistance to the study treatment and initial insights into tumor subtypes based on tumor biomarkers that are sensitive to study treatment.  Finally , the inclusion of study treatment crossover 
(see Section 3.1.3) will address important questions regarding efficacy and tolerability of a second ADC-rituximab combination following disease progression on the initial ADC-rituximab combination.   
The primary rationale for the nonrandomized portion of the study is to assess the therapeutic index (i.e., the balance of efficacy and tolerability of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg in patients  with relapsed or refractory follicular 
NHL).  An informal comparison between patients with follicular NHL treated at the two doses of the ADC will help determine if tolerability is improved at the lower ADC 
dose without substantial compromise of efficacy.   
The clinical feasibility of an ADC-rituximab combination regimen in patients with 
relapsed/refractory NHL has been previously studied.  Results from studies of rituximab 
in combination with a different CD22-specific ADC, inotuzumab ozogamicin, 
demonstrated that when combined with rituximab the ADC was able to be given at the single-agent MTD without the need for dose reduction of the ADC due to the lack of significant overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171] (Luis et al. 2006; Nam et al. 2009; Nina et al. 2010) .   
DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A are both being evaluated as single agents and in 
combination with rituximab in ongoing Phase I studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, 
respectively.  Results from these ongoing Phase I trials have determined an MTD of 
61/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
61/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  2.4 mg/kg for single-agent DCDT2980S and the RP2D of 2.4 mg/kg for single-agent 
DCDS4501A in patients with mixed NHL.  In addition, the RP2D of DCT2980S and 
DCDS4501 each in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m2) on an every-21-day 
schedule was determined to be 2.4 mg/kg.  Study GO27834 will continue to assess the 
cumulative safety and longer-term tolerability of ADC-rituximab combination therapy. 
Study drug dosing will occur on Days 1 and 2 of each 21-day (or 28-day) cycle to allow 
for recovery from potential bone marrow toxicity. 
3.2.[ADDRESS_1051228] of peripheral B-cell counts, tumor burden, and target antigen expression on tar get-mediated drug clearance over multiple 
doses of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A plus rituximab when the two drugs are given in combination, the drug levels of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A-related analytes and rituximab will be assessed in this combination study.   
In Studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, single-agent DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A 
administered by [CONTACT_33433] 21 days was evaluated at doses ranging from 0.1 to 
3.2 mg/kg for DCDT2980S, and 0.1 mg/kg to 2.4 mg/kg for DCDS4501A, in patients with NHL.  Intensive PK sampling of all patients in the ongoing Phase I studies will provide sufficient data to allow complete profiling of the distribution and elimination phases for DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A and the investigation of potential correlations between various PK parameters and efficacy and/or toxicity.  Consequently a reduced PK sampling scheme of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A will be used in this Phase II study.  
The PK data collected in this Phase II study will allow further characterization of the 
PK properties of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  In addition, the DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A concentration results from this study will be compared with available data from the single-agent clinical studies to evaluate whether concurrent administration of rituximab affects the exposure of DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A.   
Rituximab serum concentration measurements from this study will be compared with 
PK data from historical rituximab clinical studies to evaluate whether the combination 
with DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A affects the PK of rituximab.  
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES 
3.3.1 Safety Outcome Measures  
The safety and tolerability of the combination of DCDT2980S and rituximab and DCDS4501A and rituximab will be assessed us ing the following safety outcome

of total antibody (the sum of conjugated and unconjugated antibody), including rituximab, and plasma concentration-time profiles of antibody conjugated-MMAE (acMMAE) and free MMAE following administration of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A, when appropriate as data allow: 
• Total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) 
• Maximum plasma and serum concentration ( C
max) 
• Clearance (CL) • Terminal half-life (t
1/2) 
• Steady state volume of distribution ( Vss). 
Compartmental, non-compartmental, and/or population methods may be used.  Other 
parameters, such as accumulation ratio and trough plasma and serum concentration (C
min), may also be calculated. 
The following PD outcome measures will be assessed when appropriate, as data allow: 
• Peripheral blood B-cell depletion and recovery.  For each visit at which CD19+ B-cell 
measurements are taken, B-cell data will be listed for each patient by [CONTACT_766225]: 
Absolute blood cell counts 
Percent change relative to the baseline blood counts 
CD19+ B-cell recovery, defined as the timepoint when the values return to 
baseline levels or ≥ 50% of baseline levels 
 
3.3.3 Activity Outcome Measures  
The following activity outcome measures will be assessed: 
• Objective response, defined as a PR or CR 
• Duration of objective response, defined as the first occurrence of a documented 
objective response until the time of relapse or death from any cause 
• Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the date of randomization to the first 
occurrence of progression or death within [ADDRESS_1051229] 
• Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date 
of death from any cause 
 
Objective response and disease progression will be determined using standard criteria 
for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007; see Appendix C).

  3.3.4 Exploratory Outcome Measures   
The exploratory outcome measures will include, but will not be limited to, the following:  
• Confirmation and quantitation of CD22, CD79b and CD20 expression levels in either 
archival or freshly obtained (when available) tumor specimens (tumor biopsies, 
bone marrow biopsies, peripheral blood) by [CONTACT_9064]/flow 
cytometry/qRT-PCR 
• Additional assessments related to the understanding of the mechanism of action of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A and rituximab, mechanisms of resistance to DCDT2980S, 
DCDS4501A and rituximab, and/or NHL pathogenesis may be included 
• Quality of life assessments using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) 
 
3.4 SAFETY PLAN  
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study. 
Safety will be evaluated through the monitoring of the following: 
• Serious adverse events that are attributed to protocol-mandated interventions from 
the time of signing informed consent until the first dose of study treatment on 
Cycle 1, Day 1 
• All adverse events from Cycle 1, Da y [ADDRESS_1051230] dose of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A or rituximab whichever is later, including doses that were 
administered as part of crossover treatment 
• All serious adverse events from Cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_1051231] dose of 
DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A or rituximab whichever is later, including doses that were administered as part of crossover treatment 
• All serious adverse events from the last dose of DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A or 
rituximab whichever is later, including doses that were administered as part of 
crossover treatment, and which is judged to be caused by [CONTACT_766191]2980S, 
DCDS4501A or rituximab, regardless of time of onset 
• Measurements of protocol-specified hem atology and clinical chemistry laboratory 
values 
• Measurements of protocol-specified vital signs 
• Assessment of ECGs 
• Assessment of physical findings on clinical physical examinations 
Patients who have an ongoing study drug-related adverse event will be followed until the 
event has resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_226876], new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, when it has been determined that the study treatment or participation 
is not the cause of the adverse event, or the study is terminated. 
See Section 5.2.3 for assessment of causality for adverse events.

  3.4.1 Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC)  
This study will employ an Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC).  The purpose of the IMC 
will be to make recommendations regarding study conduct on the basis of trial safety data to ensure patient safety while receiving study treatment. 
The IMC will include a sponsor Medical Monitor not  affiliated with the study, Drug Safety 
Scientist, biostatistician, and statistical programmer.  Representatives from other 
Sponsor functional areas may be included as additional ad hoc members. 
In addition to the ongoing assessment of the incidence and nature of adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities by [CONTACT_82171], the IMC will review the aforementioned data at least twice during the study.  The first planned review will occur after approximately [ADDRESS_1051232] of the Medical Monitor (e.g., based on unexpected safety signals).  The IMC may make recommendations regarding study conduct, including but not limited to: performing additional safety analyses, amending the study protocol, holding patient enrollment to one or both treatment arms pending further safety evaluations, holding/discontinuing study treatment, or terminating the study. 
Complete details of the IMC will be described in the IMC charter. 
3.4.2 Risks Associated with  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  
The clinical safety profile of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A based on clinical data 
obtained in the ongoing Phase I studies are summarized in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  Based on clinical data to date, the following known and suspected risks are described below.  Guidelines around the management of these risks through dose and schedule modifications are described in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.   
Refer also to the Investigator Brochure for complete and updated details. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-Related Events 
Some monoclonal antibodies may be associated with the development of allergic or 
anaphylactic reactions, to either the active protein or excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  True allergic/anaphylactic reactions are rare after the first dose of a product, as they require prior sensitization.  Patients with true allergic/anaphylactic reactions should not receive further doses of the product.  
Monoclonal antibodies may also be associated with reactions that are clinically indistinguishable from true allergic/anaphylactic reactions, but which are mediated through direct release of cytokines or other pro-inflammatory mediators.  Such reactions are often termed infusion-related reactions.  Infusion-related reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_95469] 
65/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
65/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051233] and are generally less frequent 
and/or less severe with subsequent infusions.  They can often be managed by [CONTACT_570664]/or pre-treatment with various medications. 
Allergic/anaphylactic reactions and infusion-related reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_766173].  The onset of symptoms may be rapid, and some reactions may be life threatening. 
Patients should be monitored for these types of reactions during and after receiving 
DCDT2908S and DCDS4501A.  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A should be administered in an environment under close supervision of  a physician and where full resuscitation 
facilities are immediately available.  Specific guidelines for additional precautions to be taken during and following DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A administration are provided in Sections [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
There is a potential risk of tumor lysis sy ndrome (TLS) if treatment with DCDT2980S or 
DCDS4501A results in the rapid destruction of a large number of tumor cells.  If any evidence of this occurs during the study, tumor lysis prophylaxis measures will be instituted.  Patients who are considered to have a high tumor burden (e.g., lymphocyte count ≥
 25 x 109/L) or bulky lymphadenopathy and who are considered to be at risk 
for tumor lysis by [CONTACT_570665] 
(e.g., allopurinol ≥ 300 mg/day orally or a suitable alternative treatment according to 
institutional practice starting 12 −24 hours prior to study treatment) and must be well 
hydrated prior to the initiation of study treatment at Cycle 1, Day 1.  These patients should continue to receive repeated prophylaxi s with allopurinol and adequate hydration 
prior to each subsequent infusion as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bone Marrow Toxicity /Neutropenia  
Based on preclinical toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and clinical data from the ongoing Phase I studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g, neutropenia has been identified as a known risk (adverse drug reaction) of both DCDT2908S and DCDS4501A.  Neutropenia and neutropenia-associated events were reversible but in some cases resulted in protocol-mandated dose reductions and/or delays.   
Adequate hematologic function should be confirmed before initiation of study treatment.  
Patients receiving study treatment will be r egularly monitored for evidence of marrow 
toxicity with complete blood counts.  Treatment for hematologic toxicities may be delayed or modified as described in Section 4.3.1.  
The use of G-CSF for neutropenia is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Transfusion support 
for anemia and thrombocytopenia is also permitted at the discretion of the treating physician. 
66/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
66/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  [IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity 
As expected with any recombinant antibody, DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A may elicit 
an immune response and patients may develop antibodies against DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  Patients will be closely monitored for any potential immune response to DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  Appropriate screening and confirmatory assays will be employed to detect ATAs at multiple timepoints before, during, and after treatment with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A.  Considering the historically low immunogenicity rate of rituximab in NHL patients, ATAs against rituximab will not be monitored in this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy 
Based on clinical data from the ongoing Phase I studies DCT4862g and DCS4968g and data from brentuximab vedotin, an anti- CD30-vc-MMAE ADC (see Section 3.4.2) 
peripheral sensory neuropathy has been ident ified as a known risk (adverse drug 
reaction) for both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A. 
Patients should be monitored for signs of neuropathy or worsening neuropathy and 
appropriate action taken per protocol guidelines.  Study treatment dose and schedule modifications for significant and prolonged neuropathic toxicity and dose-reduction are 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reproductive Toxicity 
Adverse effects on human reproduction and fertility are anticipated with the administration of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A given the mechanism of action of MMAE.  Standard exclusion criteria will be used to ensure that patients of childbearing potential (male or female) are using adequate contraceptive methods.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A as well as with other antibody-dr ug conjugates using the same vc-MMAE 
platform.  Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs and/or initiation or adjustment of anti-hyperglycemic medications. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity is a potential risk of the AD Cs.  Definitive attribution of hepatotoxicity 
to the ADCs has not been established.  Transient dose-related increases in hepatic enzyme levels were observed in rats treated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  Elevations in transaminase and/or bilirubin levels requiring dose modifications have 
been reported in the ongoing clinical studies. 
3.4.3 Risks Associated with Ad cetris (Brentuximab vedotin)  
An ADC using the same MMAE drug and linker as that used in DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, but coupled to an antibody ta rgeting the CD30 antigen (brentuximab 
vedotin, ADCETRIS
TM, Seattle Genetics), was recently approved by [CONTACT_766325] 
67/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
67/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051234] common adverse reactions observed in studies with brentuximab vedotin 
(occurring in at least 20% of patients) were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, anemia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], diarrhea, pyrexia, rash, thrombocytopenia, cough, and vomiting.   
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 31% of patients receiving Adcetris.  
The most common occurring in > 2% of patients included peripheral motor neuropathy, abdominal pain, septic shock, supraventricular arrhythmia, pain in extremity and urinary tract information.  In addition, JC virus infection resulting progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death has been reported.   
Due to the use of the same MMAE drug, it is possible that the adverse events observed 
with the use of brentuximab vedotin can al so be observed with the use of DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A.   Refer to the current version of the ADCETRIS Prescribing Information for full and 
updated details. 
3.4.4 Risks Associated with Rituximab Therapy and Their 
Management  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reactions 
In single-agent clinical trials of rituximab and in postmarketing surveillance studies, mild to moderate infusion reactions consisting of fever and chills/rigors occurred in the majority of patients during the first rituximab infusion.  Other frequent infusion reaction signs and symptoms included nausea, pruritus, angioedema, asthenia, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, throat irritation, rhinitis, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, and hypertension.  These reactions generally occurred within 30 −[ADDRESS_1051235] infusion, and they resolved with slowing or interruption of the rituximab infusion and with supportive care (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen/ paracetamol, IV saline, meperidine, and vasopressors).  The incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion and decreased with each subsequent infusion. 
Rituximab has caused severe infusion reactions.  In some cases, these reactions were 
fatal.  These severe reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_766125] a time to onset of 30 −[ADDRESS_1051236] severe manifestations and sequelae include pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, 
ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events (see Appendix D).  Approximately 80% of fatal infusion reactions occurred in association 
68/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
68/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051237] infusion of rituximab.  Because of this, patients should receive 
premedication with acetaminophen/paracetamol, antihistamines, or corticosteroids, in accordance with standard clinical practice, prior to rituximab infusions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Severe Infusion Reactions 
Administration of rituximab will occur in a setting with emergency equipment and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  The rituximab infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions based on clinical judgment.   
Medications and supportive care measures ⎯including, but not limited to, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
antihistamines, glucocorticoids, IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators 
and acetaminophen/paracetamol ⎯should be available for immediate use and instituted 
as medically indicated for use in the event of a reaction during administration.   
In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate 
(e.g., from 100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved.  Patients requiring close monitoring during all rituximab infusions include those with preexisting cardiac and pulmonary conditions, those with prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary adverse events, and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥
 25,000/μ L) with or without evidence of high tumor burden. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Rapid reductions in tumor volume followed by [CONTACT_22702], hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hype rphosphatemia have been reported within 
12−[ADDRESS_1051238] 
been reported in the setting of TLS following treatment with rituximab.  The risks of TLS appear to be greater in patients with high tumor burden.  Patients deemed to be at high risk for TLS complications may at the investigator’s discretion receive their initial dose of rituximab over 2 consecutive days (see Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS]).  Correction of electrolyte 
abnormalities, monitoring of renal function and fluid balance, and administration of supportive care, including dialysis, should be initiated as indicated.  Following complete resolution of TLS complications, rituximab has been tolerated when re-administered in conjunction with prophylactic therapy for TLS in a limited number of cases. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatitis B Reactivation with  Related Fulminant Hepatitis and 
Other Viral Infections 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported for some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of these patients received rituximab in combination with 
chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately [ADDRESS_1051239] dose of 
rituximab.  Patients with serologic findings consistent with chronic HBV (Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positivity) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (HCV RNA or 
69/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
69/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  antibody positivity) are ineligible for this study.  Patients who are not chronically infected 
with HBV but have serologic evidence of prior infection at baseline (IgG anti-HBc positive, but HBV DNA negative) may be eligible (if believed to be in the patient’s best interest by [CONTACT_26791]) and would be monitored closely for perturbations in liver function during the period of rituximab treatment and every 2−[ADDRESS_1051240] 6 months after completion of rituximab therapy (Yeo et al. 2009). 
Additional serious viral infections, new, reactivated, or exacerbated (e.g., infections 
caused by [CONTACT_27912], varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, parvovirus B19, JC virus, and HCV) have been reported with rituximab, mainly in patients who had received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Particular attention should be given to patients who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment such as high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.  JC vi rus infection resulting in progressive 
multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) and death has been observed in rituximab-treated patients with hematologic malignancies or with autoimmune diseases.  Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of the patient’s last infusion of rituximab.  Physicians should consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with 
new-onset neurologic manifestations.  Evaluat ion of PML includes, but is not limited to, 
consultation with a neurologist, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture.  Physicians should discontinue rituximab (and DCDT2980S and/or DCDS4501A) and consider discontinuation or  reduction of any immunosuppressive 
therapy in patients who develop PML. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiovascular Events 
Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of rituximab.  Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including arrhythmias and angina have had recurrences of these events during rituximab therapy should be monitored throughout the infusion and the immediate post-infusion period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bowel Obstruction and Perforation 
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation, in some cases leading to death, were observed in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL.  In post-marketing reports, which include patients with low-grade or follicular NHL and patients with DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days (range, 1−77 days) in patients with documented gastrointestinal perforation.  Complaints 
of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.

  [IP_ADDRESS] Immunization 
The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not 
been studied.  Patients who participate in this study may not receive either primary or booster vaccination with live virus vaccines for at least [ADDRESS_1051241] ious diseases prior to study therapy. 
Refer to the Rituxan
®/MabThera® (Rituximab) Package Insert/SmPC for additional safety 
information. 
3.5 MINIMIZATION OF BIAS  
This is a randomized, non-comparative, open- label study.  Patients will be randomly 
allocated to two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio through use of an Interactive Voice and Web Response System (IXRS).  A dynamic stratified randomization scheme will be employed to ensure balance in the stratification factors as specified in Section 3.1. 
3.[ADDRESS_1051242] Research Organization (CRO) will be utilized  to perform project management, study 
management and clinical monitoring.  G enentech will conduct CRO oversight, approve 
patient eligibility, perform dose escalation decision-making, medical monitoring, and statistical programming and analysis. An Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC; see Section 3.4) will provide an additional level of safety monitoring for the study.  
Approximately 40 study centers in the [LOCATION_002], Canada, and Europe will participate in the study to enroll approximately 120 patients.  Additional patients may be enrolled in order to obtain additional safety and/or efficacy data. 
Electronic data capture (EDC) will be utilized for this study.  An IXRS will be used to 
assign patient numbers.  A central laboratory will be used for sample management and storage until shipment to one of several specialty laboratories or GNE for analysis.  An independent review facility (IRF) will be used for the collection and possible assessment of radiographic images from tu mor assessments.  Additional vendors for 
ECG collection and possible analysis and for PRO collection and data entry will be used.

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
This is an open-label study.  After written informed consent has been obtained and 
preliminary eligibility has been established, the study site will submit documentation 
supporting eligibility to the Sponsor via facsimile and obtain the Sponsor’s approval to enroll the patient.  Once the Sponsor reviews and approves the patient for enrollment, the patient number will be assigned via IXRS.   
As described in Section 3.1.2, only select investigator sites that have agreed to participate in the nonrandomized portion of  the study will enroll patients into these 
cohorts.  Cohorts C and D will be opened sequentially following completion of the randomized portion of the study for follicular lymphoma patients.

  4.3 STUDY TREATMENT  
4.3.1 DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation and Storage 
a. DCDT2980S 
DCDT2980S will be provided as a lyophilized powder in a single-use 20-cc vial.  
The solution for reconstitution is Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) and the reconstitution volume is 2.6 mL to yield a final concentration of 20 mg/mL DCDT2980S in 40 mM L-histidine hydrochloride, 240 mM sucrose, and 0.02% polysorbate 20, pH 6.0. 
Reconstituted DCDT2980S should be further diluted with sterile 0.9% NaCl to a total 
volume of [ADDRESS_1051249] be refrigerated at 2 °C–8°C (36°F−46°F) upon receipt until use.  
DCDT2980S should not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_242652].  Vial contents should not be frozen or shaken and should be protected from direct sunlight.  After reconstitution, DCDT2980S vials may be stored at room temperatures ( >
 8°C−25°C [> 46°F−77°F]) for up to 4 hours, or at refrigerated 
temperatures (2 °C−8°C [36°F−46°F]) for up to 8 hours prior to use.  Once DCDT2980S 
has been diluted with sterile 0.9% NaCl, the solution should be used within 4 hours at room temperature or within 8 hours at refrigerated temperature.  Vials are intended for single use only; therefore, any remaining solution should be discarded. 
For further details, refer to the DCDT2980S Investigator Brochure. 
b. DCDS4501A 
DCDS4501A is provided as a liquid formulati on and contains no preservatives.  Each 
single-use, 20-cc vial is filled to deliver [ADDRESS_1051250] is 
formulated as 10 mg/mL DCDS4501A in 20 mM L-histidine acetate, 240 mM sucrose, 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20, pH 5.5.  
DCDS4501A will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_766311] a 0.[ADDRESS_1051251] be refrigerated at 2 −8°C (36−46°F) upon receipt until use.  
DCDS4501A vials may be stored  at room temperature (
> 8°C to 25°C [46°F −77°F]) for 
up to [ADDRESS_1051252] sunlight.  Vials are intended for single use only; therefore, any remaining 
solution should be discarded.  
Once the DCDS4501A dose solution has been prepared, the solution should be used 
within 4 hours at room temperature ( > 8°C to 25°C [46°F −77°F]) or within 8 hours 
refrigerated at 2°C −8°C (36°F −46°F).   Because the Drug Product contains no

  preservatives, the Sponsor recommends using DCDS4501A in a syringe and extension 
set as soon as possible to reduce the risk of microbial contamination.   
For further details, refer to the DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage and Administration 
a. DCDT2980S-Specific Information 
DCDT2980S will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_16228].  Compatibility testing has 
shown that DCDT2980S is stable when diluted in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags to a concentration at or above 0.04 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl diluent.  The Drug Product will be delivered following dilution in 0.9% NaCl with a final DCDT2980S concentration determined based on dose and patient weight.  The study drug will be diluted in a PVC bag and delivered using a 0.22 µm in-line filter on the IV infusion set. 
Additional information/instructions regarding study drug administration will be provided in 
the Pharmacy Binder. 
b. DCDS4501A-Specific Information 
DCDS4501A will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_766312] a 0.22 µm in-line filter with a final volume of DCDS4501A determined by [CONTACT_570641].  Compatibility testing has shown that DCDS4501A is stable in both syringes made of polypropylene (PP) and in standard extension sets with 0.22 µm in-line filter, when stored neat or diluted with 0.9% NaCl saline.   
Additional information/instructions regarding study drug administration will be provided in 
the Pharmacy Binder. 
c. General Information 
The total dose of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A for each patient will depend on the patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of each cycle.  The patient weight obtained during screening may be used for dose determination at all treatment cycles; if the patient’s weight within 96 hours prior to Day 1 of a given treatment cycle differs by >10% from the weight obtained during screening, then the new weight should be used to calculate the dose.   
For both DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, the initial dose will be administered 
to well-hydrated (based on clinical judgment) patients over 90 ( ± 10) minutes.  
Pre-medication with acetaminophen or paracetamol (e.g., 500–1000 mg) and diphenhydramine (e.g., 50–100 mg) per institutional standard practice may be administered prior to each infusion.  Administration of corticosteroids is permitted at the discretion of the treating physician.  For patients who do not receive pre-medications 
prior to the first dose of DCDT2980S and who develop an infusion related reaction during the first dose should receive pre-medications prior to subsequent doses (see Table 1). 
76/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
76/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  The DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A infusion may be slowed or interrupted for patients 
experiencing infusion-associated symptoms.  Following the initial dose, patients will be observed for 90 minutes for fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, nausea, or other infusion-associated symptoms.  If the infusion is well-tolerated, subsequent doses of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A may be administered over 30 ( ± 10) minutes, followed by a 
30-minute observation period post-infusion.   
For instructions on study drug preparation and administration, refer to the DCDT2980S 
and DCDS4501A Investigator Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification 
Patients should be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to each dose using the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0 grading scale.  Dosing will occur only if a patient’s clinical assessment and laboratory test values are acceptable.  If scheduled dosing coincides with a holiday that precludes dosing, dosing should commence on the nearest following date, with subsequent dosing continuing on a 21-day schedule as applicable. 
Specific guidelines around dosage modifications for neutropenia and peripheral 
neuropathy are detailed below in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  Patients who experience 
other treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity
 or laboratory abnormalities will be 
allowed to delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab) for up to 2 weeks to 
allow for recovery.  Patients may continue to receive additional infusions of DCDT2980S 
or DCDS4501A per their treatment assignment provided that the toxicity has resolved to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥ 80% of the baseline value, whichever is lower within the 2 week delay 
period.  Upon resolution, the dose for subsequent infusions may be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.  If the toxicity that resulted in the dose reduction persists or recurs at the reduced dose, then the patient should be discontinued from study treatment.  The decision for dose modification will be made based on the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continuing study treatment and in consultation with the Medical Monitor.   
Once dose reductions of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A are made  for toxicity , dose 
re-escalation will not be allowed.  Patients who are enrolled in the nonrandomized 
portion of the study (Cohorts C and D), are dosed at an ADC dose of 1.8 mg/kg, and have progressive disease in the absence of any drug-related toxicity may have their ADC dose increased to 2.4 mg/kg if it is fe lt that there is reasonable justification for 
ongoing clinical benefit.  The decision to incr ease the dose must be made in consultation 
with and approval of the Medical Monitor. 
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A requiring its 
discontinuation, single-agent rituximab may be continued based on the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit and with the approval of the Medical Monitor.

77/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  [IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved to Grade ≤ 2 or ≥ 80% of baseline value, 
whichever is lower, may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  Dosing of 
both DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab should be held during this period.  If all study drug–related toxicities have resolved sufficiently, the patient may resume DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and rituximab dosing on the regular every-21-day schedule.   
A patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_570667] a patient’s dosing regimen from 21-day to 28-day cycles would provide 
sufficient time for recovery from a transient and reversible toxicity e.g., cytopenia without requiring repeated treatment delays.  Modifications to the dosing schedule in this fashion must be made in consultation with and with the approval of the Medical Monitor. 
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for continuation of dosing after the 2-week delay 
may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes (see Section 4.5.5).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].  
Specific guidelines around schedule modifications for neutropenia and peripheral 
neuropathy are detailed below in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reaction 
Patients will be monitored during and after each DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A infusion for [ADDRESS_1051253] infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions in the absence of infusion-related adverse events.  Patients who experience infusion-related symptoms should be managed as described in Table 1.  Precautions for suspected anaphylactic reaction during study drug infusions are provided in Appendix D. 
In the event of a life-threatening infusion-related reaction (IRR), which may include 
pulmonary or cardiac events, or an IgE-medi ated anaphylactic reaction, administration of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be immediately discontinued.  Patients who experience these reactions should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment and are not eligible to receive any additional study treatment. 
Premedication prior to DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A with acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
antihistamines, or corticosteroids per standard clinical practice is permitted, e.g., in patients with substantial tumor burden and where the risk of cytokine release syndrome is high.  In patients who do not receive premedication prior to any given dose of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A and who develop any Grade ≥ 2 infusion-related toxicity, 
premedication should be administered prior to subsequent doses.

  [IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
Because neutropenia is a known risk of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the use of growth factor support (G-CSF) as prophylactic and therapeutic indications is permitted (see Appendi x F) in order to allow continued dosing 
of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A.  Dose modifications for patients who experience treatment-related Grade 3–4 neutropenia in the context of G-CSF usage are as follows: 
• Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF, i.e., prior to the first dose of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A, is permitted for patients with clinical factors listed in 
Appendix F or who otherwise are considered at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_766128]. 
• Patients who experience treatment-related Grade 3–4 neutropenia will be allowed to 
delay dosing of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab) for up to two weeks to 
allow for recovery.  Therapeutic G-CSF is permitted as clinically indicated (see Appendix F) and to facilitate neutrophil recovery to allow subsequent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dosing. 
• Subsequent dosing DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A is permitted provided that the 
neutropenia has resolved to Grade ≤
 2, or ≥  80% of the baseline value, whichever is 
lower, within the 2-week period.   
• If prophylactic G-CSF was not administered prior to the cycle in which the 
Grade 3− 4 neutropenia developed, then prophylactic G-CSF may be administered 
prior to subsequent cycles without DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose reduction.  The dose schedule may be changed from 21-day to 28-day cycles to provide sufficient 
time for neutrophil recovery in subsequent cycles.  In the absence of prophylactic G-CSF or dose schedule modification, the dose of DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A in 
subsequent cycles should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.   
• If Grade 3–4 neutropenia recurs with prophylactic G-CSF, the dose for subsequent 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.  Prophylactic G-CSF 
and dose schedule modifications as described above are permitted in order to maintain the reduced DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose level and schedule. 
• If Grade 3–4 neutropenia recurs at the reduced dose despi[INVESTIGATOR_766151] G-CSF, then the patient should be discontinued from study treatment.   
• For patients enrolled into the nonrandomized portion of the study (Cohorts C 
and D), dose modifications will not be allowed.  Administration of 
therapeutic/prophylactic G-CSF and dose-schedule modifications as described above 
are allowed.  Patients who have persistent or recurrent Grade 3
−4 neutropenia as 
defined above should be discontinued from study treatment. 
 
The determination of the dose and schedule modifications will be made based on the 
investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continuing study treatment and with the approval of the Medical Monitor.

  [IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy is a known risk of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  For new or worsening drug-related Grade 2 or 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy, dosing should be held for up to 2 weeks until peripheral sensory neuropathy improves to Grade 1 or baseline grade.  Continuation of study treatment following dose delays beyond 2 weeks will require consultation with and approval of the Medical Monitor based on an assessment of the risk-benefit analysis of continuing to delay study treatment. 
Following resolution of peripheral sensory neuropathy, subsequent doses of 
DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A should be reduced to 1.8 mg/kg.  If worsening Grade 2 or 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy recurs following dose reduction, study treatment should be discontinued.  For Grade 4 peripheral sensory neuropathy, study treatment should be discontinued.  
For patients enrolled into the nonrandomized portion of the study (Cohorts C and D), 
dose modifications will not be allowed.  Patients who have Grade 2 or 3 peripheral 
sensory neuropathy as defined above should be discontinued from study treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A as well as with other antibody-dr ug conjugates using the same vc-MMAE 
platform.  Hyperglycemia has been reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs and/or initiation of improved anti-hyperglycemic medications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
For symptomatic fasting Grade 3 (
> 250−500 mg/dL) or asymptomatic Grade 4 
(> 500 mg/dL) hyperglycemia, medical management  should be initiated immediately and 
consultation with a specialist should be considered.  If the hyperglycemia persists for 
> 1 week after initiation of management, dose modification, schedule modification, or 
discontinuation of study treatment should be considered.  In these cases the study 
Medical Monitor should be consulted to assess the risk-benefit balance of continued study treatment.

IV = intravenous; NCI CTCAE  = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events. 
a Refer to the NCI CTCAE, v4.[ADDRESS_1051256] ed in the text following this table. 
b Supportive treatment:  Patients should be treated with acetaminophen/paracetamol and an 
antihistamine such as diphenhydramine if they  have not been received in the last 4 hours.  
IV saline may be indicated.  For bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, patients may require 
antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids (e .g., 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent), 
and/or bronchodilators.  Patients with hypotens ion requiring vasopressor support must be 
permanently discontinued from study drug. 
c Infusion rate escalation after re-initiation:  Upon complete resolution of symptoms, the infusion 
may be resumed at 50% of the rate achieved prior to interruption.  In the absence of 
infusion-related symptoms, the rate of infusion ma y be escalated in increments of 50 mg/hr every 
30 minutes.   
4.3.2 Rituximab  
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation 
Rituximab (Rituxan®/MabThera®) is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid 
concentrate for IV administration.  Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL 
in 500-mg (50-mL) single-use vials.  A single-unit, 500-mg carton contains one 50-mL vial of rituximab (10 mg/mL).  The product is formulated for IV administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL s odium citrate dihydrate, and 0.7 mg/mL 
polysorbate 80, after reconstitution with SWFI.  The pH is adjusted to 6.5.  Vials are for single use.  Each vial and carton will contain a label (either single-panel or booklet) affixed to the vial or carton.   
81/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
81/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  [IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, Admini stration, and Storage 
Rituximab (Rituxan®, MabThera®) will be administered intravenously once per 3-week 
(or 4-week) cycle.  The infusion at 375 mg/m2 for each dose will be based on the 
patient’s body surface area at screening and will remain the same throughout the study.   
If a scheduled dose of rituximab falls outside of the ±  2-day window for reasons other 
than an adverse event, the site must notify and discuss with the Genentech Medical 
Monitor prior to rituximab administration.  Such dosing may not necessarily qualify as a protocol deviation, if deemed to be in the best interests of the patient, after consultation with the Medical Monitor and agreed to in advance by [CONTACT_1689].  
Rituximab should not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  Infusion reactions may 
occur.  Premedication consisting of acetaminophen (or paracetamol), diphenhydramine (or other suitable antihistamine), and a single dose of hydrocortisone (e.g., up to 100 mg or an equivalent dose of methylprednisolone) may also be administered beginning with the first infusion, per standard clinical practice.  Premedication may attenuate infusion reactions.  Because transient hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding antihypertensive medications for [ADDRESS_1051257] Infusion 
The rituximab solution for infusion should be administered intravenously at an initial rate of 50 mg/hr.  Rituximab should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs.  If infusion reactions do not occur, the infusion rate should be escalated in 50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted.  The infusion can continue at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of patient symptoms.   
b. Subsequent Infusions 
If the patient tolerates the first infusion well, subsequent rituximab infusions may be administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr and increased in 100 mg/hr increments at 30-minute intervals to a maximum of 400 mg/hr, as tolerated.  If the patient does not tolerate the first infusion well, the guidelines for the first infusion should be followed. 
If a patient tolerates the first three cycles of study treatment without significant infusion 
reactions, rituximab may be administered as “rapid infusion” in accordance with local institutional guidelines. 
c. Storage 
Rituximab vials must be stored at 2 °C–8°C (36°C–46°F).  Rituximab vials should be 
stored in the outer carton in order to protect them from light.  Rituximab solution for infusion may be stored at 2 °C–8°C (36°C–46°F) for 24 hours and has been shown to be 
stable for an additional 12 hours at room temperature.  However, since rituximab does not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be stored refrigerated (2 °C–8°C).

been observed. 
See the Rituxan® (Rituximab) Package Insert or SmPC (in the E.U.) for additional 
information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification 
There will be no rituximab dose modification in this study.  Patients at high risk for 
TLS complications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive their initial dose of rituximab over 2 consecutive days (e.g., 125 mg/m
2 on Day 1, 
250 mg/m2 on Day 2; with DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A dose potentially delayed to Day 3). 
Any NCI CTCAE, v4.0, toxicity Grade ≥ 3 in severity that is deemed related to rituximab 
treatment will require interruption of study treatment (both ADC and rituximab) until resolution to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥ 80% of baseline, whichever is lower.  Resumption of 
rituximab treatment may be considered in patients with resolution of toxicities to Grade ≤
 1 within 2 weeks at the discretion of the investigator, after consultation with the 
Medical Monitor.  Failure of such toxiciti es to resolve after 2-week delay in study 
treatment will require permanent discontinuation of rituximab.  Continuation of rituximab 
treatment may be permitted on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].   
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity to rituximab requiring its discontinuation, 
single-agent DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A may be continued based on the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit and with the approval of the Medical Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Schedule Modification 
Patients in whom toxicities have not resolved (i.e., to Grade ≤  1 or ≥  80% of baseline) 
may have their study treatment delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 weeks.  If after the up to 2-week delay all study drug–related toxicities have resolved sufficiently, the patient may receive the scheduled doses of rituximab.  In addition, a patient’s dosing may be changed to a 28-day cycle if it is felt by [CONTACT_766233] a patient’s dosing regimen from 21-day to  28-day cycles would provide sufficient time for recovery 
from transient cytopenias without requiring repeated treatment delays. 
Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for dosing after the additional [ADDRESS_1051259] 
elapsed may be discontinued from study treatment and be followed for safety outcomes (see Section 4.5.5).  Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766224].  In addition, delay of therapy because of toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation and will be discussed with the Medical Monitor.

  [IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reaction 
Patients will be monitored during and after each rituximab infusion for [ADDRESS_1051260] infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions in the absence of infusion-related adverse events.  Patients who experience infusion-related symptoms should be managed as directed in Table 1 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
In the event of a life-threatening IRR (which may include pulmonary or cardiac events) or 
IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction to rituximab, rituximab should be discontinued and no additional rituximab should be administered.  Patients who experience these reactions should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment and should be discontinued from study treatment. 
4.4 CONCOMITANT AND EXCLUDED THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_5165]  
4.4.1 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medications or over-the-counter preparations used by a patient between t he 7 days preceding the screening evaluation 
and the end of study visits.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the appropriate electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, or other 
maintenance therapy should continue their use.  Concomitant use of hematopoietic 
growth factors is allowed in accordance with instructions provided in the package inserts. 
Patients who experience infusion-related temperature elevations of > 38.5°C (> 101.3°F) 
or other minor infusion-related symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen/paracetamol ( ≥ 500 mg) and/or H1 and H2 histamine-receptor 
antagonists (e.g., diphenhydramine, ranitidine).  Serious infusion-related events manifested by [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, wheez ing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced 
oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_766130] (e.g., supplemental oxygen, β2-agonists, and/or corticosteroids) as clinically 
indicated according to standard clinical practice (see Table 1).   
Infusion reaction prophylaxis with medications (e.g., acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids) may be instituted at any point in the study if it is determined to be in the best interest of the patient based on observation of IRRs in patients already enrolled in the study.  Patients with Grade [ADDRESS_1051261] be pre-medicated prior to retreatment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Patients with hypotension requiring vasopressor support, or with Grade [ADDRESS_1051262] be permanently discontinued from study treatment.

outcomes for 30 days following the patient’s last dose of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A or rituximab, whichever is later, or until the patient receives another anti-cancer therapy whichever occurs first. 
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
4.5.1 Definitions of Study Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical Hist ory and Demographics 
Medical history includes all clinically signifi cant diseases, prior cancer history, prior 
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649], and all medications used by [CONTACT_25701] 7 days preceding the screening visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a sitting or semi-supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], pulse oximetry, pulse rate, and body temperature.  Every effort will be made to ensure that vital signs are obtained from patients in a consistent manner and position.  The timing of vital sign collection on the days of study treatment administration is as follows: 
• For the administration of rituximab, vital signs should be assessed prior to the start 
of the infusion, every 15 ( ±
 5) minutes during the first hour of the infusion, as 
clinically indicated during the remainder of the infusion, and following the completion 
of the infusion.

  • For patients who sign the optional consent, a blood sample will be collected prior to 
the first dose of study treatment for exploratory research. 
• Tumor tissue sample (archival or fresh) will be collected from patients for central 
pathologic review as described in Sections 4.1.1 and [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Local Laboratory Assessments 
Samples for hematology, serum chemistry, liver function, and pregnancy will be 
analyzed at the study site’s local laboratory.  Local laboratory assessments may be obtained up to 72 hours prior to start of study treatment administration on Day 1 of the treatment cycle.   
• Hematology:  Includes complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell

  [IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram Assessments 
Twelve-lead digital ECG measurements will be obtained in triplicate, with immediately 
consecutive ECGs obtained until three evaluable ECGs are recorded, at the following timepoints: 
• Screening 
• 30− 60 minutes before the start of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in Cycle 1 
• 30− 60 minutes after the completion of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in 
Cycle 1 
• 30− 60 minutes after the completion of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A infusion in 
Cycle 3 
• Day 8 (±1 day) of Cycle [ADDRESS_1051265]-DCDT2980s/DCDS4501A infusion ECGs for Cycle 3 
• Treatment completion/early termination visit 
 
Non-triplicate ECGs should also be performed when clinically indicated in any patient 
with evidence of, or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_168431], clinically significant signs or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction.  
All ECGs as described above will be submitted to a Sponsor-designated ECG central 
laboratory for storage and potential analysis.  Detailed instructions on ECG acquisitions and transmissions to the ECG central laboratory will be provided in the ECG manual provided for this study. 
Representative ECGs at each timepoint should be reviewed by [CONTACT_1720] a 
qualified designee.  Post-screening ECG measurements should be obtained as close as possible to scheduled serum and plasma PK samples (see Appendices B-1 and B-2) and should be no more than 30 minutes apart.  If QTc prolongation ( >
 500 msec and 
>60 msec longer than the pre-dose baseline value) is noted, ECGs should be repeated until the prolongation is reversed or stabilized.  If a PK sample is not scheduled at the timepoint where QTc prolongation is first observed, then an unscheduled sample should be obtained.  An evaluation for potential causes of QT prolongation e.g., electrolyte imbalances or concomitant medications, s hould be performed, study treatment dosing 
held, and the Medical Monitor notified.  Management of QT/QTc prolongation should be performed in accordance with institutional standard of care at the discretion of the treating physician. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A  will be characterized by [CONTACT_766237] (conjugated and unconjugated antibody), antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), and free MMAE concentrations usi ng validated methods (see Section 4.9).  
Plasma samples may also be analyzed for other potential MMAE containing catabolites, per sponsor’s discretion.  Pharmacokinetics of rituximab will be characterized by [CONTACT_766290] a validated method (see Section 4.9).  These 
88/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
88/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  assessments will allow for further characterization of PK of DCDT2980S and 
DCDS4501A, the assessment of the drug interaction potential when they are given in combination with rituximab, and the investigation of potential correlations between PK parameters and safety and/or activity if data allow and at the sponsor’s discretion.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity Assessments 
The immunogenicity evaluation will utilize a risk-based strategy and tiered approach (Rosenberg and Worobec 2004a; 2004b, 2005, Koren et al. 2008) designed to detect and characterize all anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA) responses to DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A.  Patient samples will be first screened to detect all antibody responses toward DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A.  Samples that screen positive will be analyzed in a confirmatory assay (competitive binding with DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A) to assess the specificity of the positive response.  Titers will be determined for confirmed positive samples. Further characterization will be assessed by [CONTACT_766328] (mAb) component of DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A to characterize if the ATA responses are primarily to the mAb or the linker-drug regions of the ADC.  Positive ATA samples will be stored for further characterization of ATA responses, if necessary.   
The schedule of sample collection for ATA assessment is outlined in Appendices B-1 
and B-2, depending on the schedule of study treatment administration.  Samples for ATA will not be collected during the crossover treatment period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Response Assessments 
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and re-assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response assessments will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], based on physical examinations, CT and/or MRI scans, and bone marrow examinations, using standard response criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007) (see Appendix C). 
a. Radiographic Assessments 
CT scans with contrast should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis scans; CT scans of the neck should be performed at screening and followed only if disease is present at screening.   Post-screening radiographic assessments may be limited to areas of prior involvement only if required by [CONTACT_72952]. 
MRI scans may be used instead of CT scans in patients for whom CT scans with 
intravenous contrast are contraindicated.  Details regarding imaging procedures in these cases will be provided in the Imaging Manual. 
An 
18F-FDG-PET (hereafter referred as PET) scan is required during screening for all 
patients with DLBCL.  An additional PET scan in DLBCL patients should be obtained at 
the 6-month tumor assessment to ensure consistency of response assessment methodology at this time point for all patients.  PET scans should additionally be 
89/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
89/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  obtained to confirm disappearance of metabolically active disease during study 
treatment and to confirm a complete response (CR) upon discontinuation of study treatment.   
For patients with FL, PET scans are not required but may be obtained based on 
physician preference and if permitted by [CONTACT_72952].  Similar for DLBCL, PET scans on FL patients should be obtained during screening; for patients whose tumors are PET-positive during screening, an additional PET scan should be obtained at the 6-month tumor assessment.  PET scans should additionally be obtained to confirm disappearance of metabolically active disease during study treatment and to confirm a complete response (CR) upon discontinuation of study treatment.  
For all patients regardless of disease subtype, combined PET-CT scans may be used 
instead of CT alone if performed with contrast and if collected with resolution sufficient to allow accurate and consistent comparison of target lesion measurements with subsequent PET-CT scans.  If a PET-CT scan is to be used during screening, then PET-CT scans should be performed for all subsequent tumor assessments in order to ensure their consistency across different timepoints. 
All tumor assessments will be submitted to an independent review facility (IRF) for 
storage and possible independent centralized review.  Details related to submission of data to the IRF will be defined in a separate Imaging Manual. 
b. Bone Marrow Assessments 
A bone marrow biopsy for morphology is required at screening and should reflect disease status in the bone marrow following documented relapse on the last prior therapy or within 3 months of Day 1, whichever occurs later.  If the bone marrow biopsy at screening demonstrates presence of tumor cells, a subsequent bone marrow examination is required only to confirm a CR or if clinically indicated.  If the bone marrow biopsy at screening does not demonstrate presence of tumor cells, then subsequent bone marrow examination is required only if clinically indicated. 
c. Schedule of Tumor Response Assessments 
Tumor response assessments will be performed ev ery three months (± 1 week) from the 
initiation of study treatment until study treatment completion or early termination, e.g., between Days [ADDRESS_1051266] eight 21-day cycles of treatment.   The schedule of tumor assessments should be 
independent of the study treatment dose schedule.  The schedule of tumor response assessments is detailed in Appendix A-1.  As stated above, for all DLBCL patients, PET scans are required during the screening period and at the 6-month tumor assessment timepoint. 
The schedule for tumor response assessments for patients who proceed to crossover 
treatment is detailed in Appendix A-2.   
90/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
90/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  Additional response assessments, after the final dose of study treatment, for patients 
who discontinue from study treatment (either initial or crossover treatment) for reasons other than progressive disease, will be performed as described in Appendix A-3.  
Tumor assessments should also be performed within [ADDRESS_1051267] study drug 
infusion (both initial and crossover treatment) at the treatment completion/early termination visit.  Imaging scans are not required at the treatment completion/early termination visit if scans have been performed wi thin the previous [ADDRESS_1051268] be performed.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Explor atory Research 
a. Tumor Tissue Samples 
Required Tumor Tissue Samples  
Tumor tissue samples will be used for central pathologic laboratory review of CD20, CD22 and CD79b expression.  Additional studies to fulfill the exploratory objectives in 
Section 3.3.4 will be performed, including but not limited to the following: 
• Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling for signatures of NHL biology, 
including prognostic subpopulations (Alizadeh et al. 2000; Wright et al. 2003), target 
expression (CD20, CD22 and CD79b) and apoptotic response  
• Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from cores taken from provided blocks for IHC and ISH 
assessments, including: 1) DLBCL classifiers in tissue obtained from patients with 
DLBCL (CD10; GCET, Mum1; FoxP1 LMO2 (Meyer P N et al. 2011); and 2) biomarker endpoints involved in response to chemotherapy including quantitation 
of Bcl-2 protein and genetic alterations of bcl-2 including gene rearrangements, 
amplifications and t(14;18) translocations. Additional IHC markers may include those related to the tumor microenvironment. 
• Tumor DNA to assess mutations that have been shown to be associated with NHL 
biology and activation of the B-cell receptor, including mutations in CD79b 
(Pasqualucci et al. 2012) 
 
For patients who develop progressive disease and are eligible to receive crossover 
treatment (see Section 3.1.3) a biopsy of a safely accessible site of disease will be performed.  Tumor tissue samples obtained at this time point will be used to assess changes in biology, target expression and regulators of apoptosis as described above, which have occurred and may be linked to progression on initial study treatment. 
Protocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
91/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  Optional Tumor Tissue Samples (Requires Optional Research Informed Consent  
For patients who provide informed consent, an optional tumor biopsy will be collected at 
time of progression from the following patients: 
• Patients who develop disease progression following initial study treatment and do 
not proceed to receive crossover treatment 
• Patients who develop disease progression on crossover treatment 
 
Tumor tissue samples obtained at these time points will be used to assess changes in 
biology, target expression and regulators of apoptosis, as described above, that have occurred and may be linked to progression on treatment. 
b. Blood and Plasma Samples 
A plasma sample will be collected prior to treatment. 
For patients who sign the Optional Research Informed Consent, an additional blood 
sample will also be taken prior to treatment. 
The plasma and blood samples may be used for the assessment of specific tumor 
biologic markers, including proteins, circulating DNA, and microRNAs.  The information obtained from these samples will enable a better understanding of the biology of NHL and disease prognosis, identify potential predictors of response to treatment with DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A and/or rituximab, improve diagnostic assessments, and identify and characterize mechanisms of  resistance to DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A and 
rituximab activity.   
As tumorigenesis is a multiple step process linked to somatic events, any DNA analysis 
will focus on sporadic mutations specifically found in tumor tissue and not on inherited changes found in the whole body.  For this purpose, some tumor-containing sections may be taken from the tissue block and used for the DNA extraction process.  Assays on stored tissue samples may be performed at Genentech or at a central specialty laboratory. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Reported Outcome 
The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI; Cleeland et al ., 2000; Appendix E) is a 
multi-symptom patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure for clinical and research use. The MDASI’s [ADDRESS_1051269] frequency and/or severity in patients with various cancers and treatment types.  These include pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, emotional distress, shortness of breath, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, difficulty remembering and numbness or tingling.  Six additional items focus on the degree of interference of the aforementioned symptoms for a total of 23 items in the questionnaire.

92/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  Patient-reported outcome data will be elicited from all patients in this study to more fully 
characterize the clinical profile of study treatment.  The MDASI PRO instrument will be supplied in the local language of each participating country.  Electronic (hand held computers) will be used for the daily collecti on of symptoms derived from the MDASI.   
4.5.[ADDRESS_1051270]-of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may be used; such tests do not need to be repeated for screening. 
The availability of a patient’s tumor tissue sample for studies (see Sections 4.1.1 and 
4.5.1.i) should be confirmed prior to Cycle 1,  Day 1.  Such specimens should consist of 
representative core biopsy in a paraffin block, which is the preferred method, or at least 15 unstained slides.  Tumor specimens should be submitted with an accompanying pathology report and may be obtained at any time prior to entry to study.

Refer to the Study Flowchart provided in Appendix A-1 for the schedule of screening and 
pretreatment assessments. 
4.5.3 Assessments during Treatment  
Study drug infusions (rituximab, DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A) should occur on the scheduled 21-day (or 28-day) cycle, but may be given up to ± 2 days from the date 
scheduled (i.e., with a minimum of 19 days between doses) if required for logistical/scheduling reasons.  All other study visits during Cycles [ADDRESS_1051271] occur within ± 1 day from the scheduled date, unless otherwise noted.  Study visits starting in 
Cycle 3 should occur within ± 2 days from the scheduled date, unless otherwise noted.  
All assessments will be performed on the day of  the specified visit unless a time window 
is specified.  Assessments scheduled on the day  of study drug administration (Day 1) of 
each cycle should be performed prior to study drug infusion unless otherwise noted.

administration on Day 1 of each cycle.  Otherwise, laboratory samples should be drawn 0–[ADDRESS_1051272] be reviewed and the review documented prior to study drug administration. 
Refer to the Study Flowchart provided in Appendix A-1 for the schedule of treatment 
period assessments. 
4.5.4 Study treatment Completion Visit  
Patients who complete study treatment (approximately 1 year/17 cycles) or discontinue from study treatment early will be asked to return to the clinic within [ADDRESS_1051273] DCDT2980S or DCDS4501A or rituximab infusion (whichever is later) for a study treatment completion visit.  The visit at which response assessment shows progressive disease may be used as the early termination visit. 
Refer to the Study Flowchart provided in Appendix A-1 for assessments to be performed 
at the treatment completion/early termination visit. 
Assessments conducted at the treatment completion/early termination visit may be used 
for the purposes of re-screening to determine eligibility to receive crossover treatment (see Section 3.1.3 and Section 4.5.5). 
4.5.5 Crossover Treatment Completion Visit  
Patients who fulfill the criteria to receive crossover treatment (see Section 3.1.3) will have assessments during the crossover treatment period as described in Appendix A-2.  The same guidelines regarding scheduling of assessments for treatment with initial study treatment as detailed in Section 4.5.[ADDRESS_1051274] on-treatment 
assessments as described in Appendix A-2. 
Patients who complete the crossover treatm ent (approximately 1 year/17 cycles) or 
discontinue from crossover treatment early will be asked to return to the clinic within 
[ADDRESS_1051275] DCDT2980S, DCDS4501A or  rituximab infusion (whichever is 
later) for a crossover treatment completion/early termination visit.  The visit at which response assessment shows disease progression on crossover treatment may be used as the early termination visit.

  4.5.6 Follow-Up Assessments  
Ongoing adverse events thought to be related to DCDT2980S, DCS4501A, or rituximab 
will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline (pre-treatment) grade, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_226876], new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or when it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
Patients will be followed after the last dose of study treatment (either initial study 
treatment or crossover treatment) for safety outcomes.  Such follow-up will require an assessment (per verbal report, at minimum) of any adverse events and serious adverse events for [ADDRESS_1051276]. 
Patients who discontinue from study treatment (either initial study treatment or crossover 
treatment) for reasons other than progressive disease will be followed for response for up to [ADDRESS_1051277] infusion of study treatment or until disease progression or initiation of another anti-lymphoma/leukemia therapy, whichever occurs first.  Response assessments should occur approximately every 2 −[ADDRESS_1051278]-treatment assessments are described in Appendix A-3.   
Following discontinuation of study treatment,  patients will be followed for survival 
approximately every three months until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination.  
4.6 PATIENT DISCONTINUATION 
4.6.1 Discontinuation from Treatment  
Patients may discontinue study treatment early for reasons other than disease progression, such as patient/investigator choice or unacceptable toxicity.  The reasons for early discontinuation of treatment must be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  Patients may continue treatment with either DCDT2980S/DCDS4501A or rituximab alone following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the patient by [CONTACT_766329]. 
Refer to Sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.5 for assessments that are to be performed for patients 
who discontinue from the study during the study treatment period.

event on the crossover treatment. 
The investigator has the right to discontinue a patient from the study for any medical 
condition that the investigator determines may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study, for reasons of noncompliance (e.g., missed doses, visits), pregnancy, or if the investigator determines it is in the best interest of the patient. 
Refer to Section 4.5.4 and 4.5.5 for assessments that are to be performed for patients 
who prematurely discontinue from the study during the treatment period. 
4.7 STUDY DISCONTINUATION 
Genentech has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to patients. 
• Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory. 
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.

max, CL, V ss, and t 1/2).  Estimates for these 
parameters will be tabulated and summarized (mean, standard deviation, and range).  Non-compartmental, compartmental and/or population methods will be used, as data allow.  
Exposure-response (safety and efficacy) analysis may be conducted using PK data and 
available drug effect (e.g., imaging, measures of tumor burden), and toxicity (e.g., clinical pathology) data, at the sponsor’s discretion. 
In addition, population PK methods may be employed to manage sparse data and to 
investigate the effects of certain covariates on the pharmacokinetics of DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A, as data allow, and at the sponsor’s discretion.

primary assessment of response will be based on CT scans only; the assessment of response in FL based on PET scans will be performed for exploratory purposes only.  
Among patients with an objective response, duration of response will be defined as the time from the initial CR or PR to the time of disease progression or death.  If a patient does not experience death or disease progression before the end of the study, duration of response will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), PFS is defined as the time 
from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death  from any 
cause , whichever occurs first.  If a patient has not experienced progressive disease or 
death, PFS will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment.  Patients with no

4.10.7 Determination of Sample Size  
For the randomized portion of the study (Arms A and B), a  target of 120 patients will be 
enrolled in two separate cohorts of patients (40 in the follicular NHL cohort and 80 in the DLBCL cohort).  Genentech has judged this sample size to provide sufficient precision in estimating the anti-tumor activity of DCDT2980S combined with rituximab or DCDS4501A combined with rituximab as measured by [CONTACT_33966].  For example, with the assumption of an observed response rate of 40%, a 90% confidence interval for the response rate would be approximately 22% −58% (i.e., 40% ±  18%) for the follicular NHL 
cohort and approximately 27% −53% (i.e., 40% ±  13%) for the DLBCL cohort. 
This is a non-comparative hypothesis-generat ing study.  There is no formal hypothesis 
testing planned to compare the treatment arms .  Specifically, for the randomized 
portion of the study,  there is insufficient power to detect minimum clinically meaningful 
differences between the two treatment arms. 
4.11 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The data will be collected via Electronic Data Capture (EDC) using eCRFs.  The site will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, the CRO will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system.  The CRO will be responsible for the data management of this trial, including quality checking of the data.   
Genentech will perform oversight of the data management of this trial.  Genentech will 
produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central Laboratory data and other
 electronic data will be sent 
directly to Genentech, using Genentech’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.  eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  System backups for data stored at Genentech and records retention for the study data will be consistent with Genentech’s standard procedures.

events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); measurement of protocol-specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; physical examinations and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug(s). 
Genentech or its designee is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the Competent 
Authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, European Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC), and/or local regulatory requirements. 
Genentech or its designee is responsible for reporting unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening events associated with the use of the study drug to the regulatory agencies and competent authorities by [CONTACT_144530] 7 calendar days after being notified of the event.  Genentech or its designee will report other relevant SAEs 
associated with the use of the study medication to the appropriate competent authorities (according to local guidelines), investigators, and central IRBs/ECs (except in the [LOCATION_002] where investigators are responsible for reporting to their IRBs per local requirements) by a written safety report within [ADDRESS_1051290] (IMP) or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. 
This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol-specified 
AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with the baseline 
hematologic malignancy (i.e., leukemia or lymphoma) that were not present prior to the AE reporting period (see Section 5.2.1) 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions 
(e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
• AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a 
protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., medication washout, no treatment run-in, or 
invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
• Preexisting medical conditions other than the disease under study that are

  5.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that is any of the following: 
• Fatal (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death) 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
the investigational product(s) 
• Considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs. 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous .  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an AE (as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and 
SAEs on the eCRF.   
5.1.[ADDRESS_1051291] (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Non-serious adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_13657] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting in structions), irrespective of regulatory 
seriousness criteria.  Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST 
in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
[CONTACT_25742]’s law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]; treatment-emergent ALT or AST 
> 3 × baseline value 
in combination with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN [of which 35% is direct bilirubin]) 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] 
• Grade ≥2 motor neuropathy 
• Grade ≥2 infusion reactions

  5.2 METHODS AND TIMING FOR CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs (as defined in 
Section 5.1) are recorded on the eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with protocol instructions.  
5.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs caused by a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g., SAEs related to invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run-in). 
After initiation of study drug (the Genentech product(s) or other investigational medicinal 
product), all new AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution will be collected until [ADDRESS_1051292] administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is later.  After this period, investigators should report only SAEs that are felt to be related to prior study treatment (see Section 5.6).   
5.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all patient evaluation time points should be adopted.  Ex amples of non-directive questions include: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1051293].  All AEs 
and SAEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_766295], will 
be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
For each AE and SAE recorded on the applicable eCRF, the investigator will make an 
assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.1.2 for seriousness criteria), severity and causality.   
Table [ADDRESS_1051294](s).  
The AE grading (severity) scale found in the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0 will be used for AE reporting.

The NCI CTCAE v4.0 can be found: http://ct ep.cancer.gov/reportin g/ctc_v30.html  
Note:  Regardless of severity, some events ma y also meet regulatory serious criteria.  
Refer to definitions of an SAE (see Section 5.1.2). 
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or 
reported AE is not in the NCI CTCAE listing.   
To ensure consistency of causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guidelines: 
Table 3 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the AE/SAE suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_362241], 
evidence, science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product administration 
makes a causal relationship possible, A ND other drugs, therapeutic interventions 
or underlying conditions do not provide sufficient explanation for the AE/SAE.   
NO The temporal relationship of the AE/SAE to investigational product administration 
makes a causal relationship unlikely, OR other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the AE/SAE.   
AE=adverse event; SAE=serious adverse event.   
The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the “Yes” or “No” causality assessment for individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators and applicable regulatory authorities.

104/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051295] medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or 
SAEs on the eCRF.  Avoid co lloquialisms and abbreviations. 
There is one eCRF page for recording AEs or SAEs. 
Only one medical concept should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnos is or syndrome at the time of reporting, 
each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  
However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hem orrhage leads to renal failure, both events 
should be recorded separately on the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient evaluation time points.  Such events should only be recorded once in the eCRF unless their severity increases.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it should be recorded again on the Adverse Event eCRF.   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points 
and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on Adverse Event eCRF. 
105/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
105/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management, 
e.g., concomitant medication, will be recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF 
(e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.) 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5
 × the upper limit of normal associated with 
cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., c holecystitis) needs to be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF. 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term 
should be recorded as the AE or SAE.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Specific to this study, lymphopenia and l eukopenia due to lymphopenia of any grade are 
expected PD effects of study drug and therefore are not considered to be adverse 
events.  However, complications of lymphopenia (e.g., infections) will need to be reported as adverse events.  In addition, because monocytopenia is not reportable and neutropenia is already being monitored and reported as an adverse event, leukopenia does not need to be reported as a distinct adverse event. 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF, unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (including a diagnostic evaluation not mandated 
in this protocol) or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
106/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
106/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis 
or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  Therefore, investigators must report  as an adverse event the occurrence of 
either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST 
> 3 × baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN (of which 35% is  direct bilirubin) 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or  a non-serious adverse event of special 
interest (see Section 5.4.2)  
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
Deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period (see Section 5.2.1) that are attributed by [CONTACT_766296].  All other on-study deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor. 
When recording a death on an eCRF, the event or condition that caused or contributed 
to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such 
conditions should be recorded on the Medical and Surgical History eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if  the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
107/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
107/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent
 headaches”). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Worsening of Basel ine Hematologic Malignancy 
Worsening and/or progression of the baseline hematologic malignancy (e.g. leukemia or lymphoma) should not
 be recorded as an AE or SAE.  These data will be captured as 
efficacy assessment data only.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonge d Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766153].   
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766137].  These scenarios include a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281914]: 
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study 
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a preexisting medical 
condition that has not changed 
• Receive scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
If a female patient becomes pregnant while receiving the study drug or within [ADDRESS_1051296], a Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy report will automatically be generated and sent to Genentech’s Drug Safety Department or its designee.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Male patients must also be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if their 
partner becomes pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_1051297] dose of study drug.  If such an event occurs, it should be reported as described below. 
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should always be classified as an SAE 
(as the Sponsor considers these medically significant), recorded on an Adverse Event eCRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2). 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed 
to study drug should be classified as an SAE, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2). 
After the study period, abortions, congenital anomalies/birth defects, and pregnancy 
outcomes should still be reported expeditiously to the Sponsor.

representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  A copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the pat ient’s legally authorized representative.  
If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language. 
112/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
112/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051305] remain in each patient’s study file and must 
be available for verification by [CONTACT_9534]. 
The Informed Consent Form should be revised whenever there are changes to 
procedures outlined in the informed consent or  when new information becomes available 
that may affect the willingness of the patient to participate. 
For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history for each patient shall 
document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained for the updated/revised Consent Form for continued participation in the study.  The final revised IRB/EC-approved Informed Consent Form must be provided to Genentech for regulatory purposes. 
If the site utilizes a separate Authorization Form for patient authorization to use and 
disclose personal health information under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, the review, approval, and other processes 
outlined above apply except that IRB/IEC review and approval may not be required per study site policies. 
Optional Research Informed Consent 
Informed consent for the collection and use of fresh tumor tissue at time of progression for optional research described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be documented in a section of the main Informed Consent Form.  This section provides patients with the option to authorize the collection and use of these samples and personal health information for additional research purposes.  Agreement to participate in the optional research (by [CONTACT_766298]) is not required for enrollment in the trial but is required prior to any optional research sample collection.  Optional consent may be withdrawn at any time by [CONTACT_102]. 
6.[ADDRESS_1051306] be submitted to the IRB/EC by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_766155].  In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25685]/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the regulatory requirements and policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol changes or amendments and of any unanticipated problem s involving risk to human patients 
or others. 
113/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
113/P GO27834 A-1
 
      
  In addition to the requirements to report protocol-defined AEs to the Sponsor, 
investigators are required to promptly  report to their respective IRB/EC all unanticipated 
problems involving risk to human patients.  Some IRBs/ECs may want prompt notification of all SAEs, whereas others require notification only about events that are serious, assessed to be related to study treatment, and are unexpected.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety-related communications from Genentech.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements and with the policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and archived in the site’s Study File.  
6.[ADDRESS_1051307] study data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_766175]/representatives and collaborators, the U.S. FDA, other regulatory agencies, Institutional Review Boards, and the respective national or local health authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 
6.[ADDRESS_1051308] be kept with the study records. 
6.7 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents are where patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
114/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
114/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051309] never be obliterated or destroyed. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigator(s) and institution(s) must provide the Sponsor direct 
access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_112103]. 
6.8 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the sour ce document if the system has been validated 
in accordance with FDA requirements per taining to computerized systems used in 
clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system (for clinical research purposes) would be one that (1) allows data entry only by [CONTACT_4539]; (2) prevents the deletion or alteration of previously entered data and provides an audit trail for such data changes (e.g., modification of file); (3) protects the database from tampering; and (4) ensures data preservation. 
In collaboration with the study monitor, Genentech’s Quality Assurance group may assist 
in assessing whether electronic records generated from computerized medical record systems used at investigational sites can serve as source documents for the purposes of this protocol. 
If a site’s computerized medical record system is not adequately validated for the 
purposes of clinical research (as opposed to general clinical practice), applicable hardcopy source documents must be maintained to ensure that critical protocol data entered into the eCRFs can be verified. 
6.9 STUDY MEDICATION ACCOUNTABILITY 
All study drug required for completion of this study will be provided by [CONTACT_8229].  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_27834].  Damaged supplies will be replaced. 
Accurate records of all study drug received at, dispensed from, returned to and disposed 
of by [CONTACT_473501]. 
Study drug will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s 
institutional standard operating procedure or returned to Genentech with the appropriate documentation, as determined by [CONTACT_3452] .  If the study site chooses to destroy 
study drug, the method of destruction must be documented. 
115/P GO27834 AProtocol:  DCDT2980S and DCDS4501A—Genentech, Inc.
115/P GO27834 A-[ADDRESS_1051310] evaluate and approve the study site’s drug destruction standard 
operating procedure prior to the initiation of drug destruction by [CONTACT_3452]. 
6.[ADDRESS_1051311] parties as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate authorization to use and disclose personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_9536]. 
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare for treatment purposes. 
Data generated by [CONTACT_26832] U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies, national and local health authorities, Genentech monitors/representativ es and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for 
each study site, if appropriate. 
6.11 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
U.S. FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) and the ICH Guideline for GCP (see Section 4.9 of the guideline) require that records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational drug, including eCRFs, consent forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_8178] [ADDRESS_1051312] retention requirements set forth in the U.S. FDA IND regulations and the relevant national and local health authorities, whichever is longer.

Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL 
Adapted from:  Cheson BD, Pfistner B, Juweid ME, et al . Revised Response Criteria for Malignant 
Lymphoma. J Clin Oncol 2007;25:579–86. 
Selection of Indicator (Target) Lesions  
Up to six of the largest dominant nodes or tumor masses selected according to all of the 
following: 
• Clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions 
Abnormal lymph nodes are those that are either 
>[ADDRESS_1051340] transverse diameter (GTD) regardless of the short axis 
diameter, or 
> 10 mm in short axis diameter regardless of long axis 
• If possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body 
• Should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites 
are involved 
• Extranodal lesions within the liver or spleen must be at least 1.0 cm in 
two perpendicular dimensions. 
PET Scans--Definition of a Positive PET scan  
Visual assessment currently is considered adequate for determining whether a PET scan is 
positive, and use of the standardized uptake value is not necessary.  In brief, a positive scan is defined as focal or diffuse FDG uptake above background in a location incompatible with normal anatomy or physiology, without a specific standardized uptake value cutoff.  Other causes of false-positive scans should be ruled out.  Exceptions include mild and diffusely 
increased FDG uptake at the site of moderate or large-sized masses with an intensity that is lower than or equal to the mediastinal blood pool, hepatic or splenic nodules 1.5 cm with FDG uptake lower than the surrounding liver/spleen uptake, and diffusely increased bone marrow uptake within weeks after treatment. 
Complete Remission (CR)  
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease 
and disease-related symptoms if present prior to therapy.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid lymphoma: in patients with no pre-treatment PET scan or when 
the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any 
size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.

APPENDIX C (cont.) 
Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL 
      
  Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, the designation of CR requires all nodal indicator lesions to regress to the size of normal lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes that were > [ADDRESS_1051341] regress to ≤ 15 mm in GTD 
regardless of the short axis diameter.  Lymph nodes that were 11 to 15 mm in GTD and > [ADDRESS_1051342] 
regress to ≤  10 mm in the short axis diameter. 
2. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged prior to therapy on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be 
considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to lymphoma should disappear.  However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable 
because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an 
enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma. 
3. If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_248287], the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy.  The biopsy sample on which this determination 
is made must be adequate (>
 20 mm unilateral core).  If the sample is indeterminate by 
[CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064].  A sample that is negative 
by [CONTACT_127890] a small population of clonal lymphocytes by 
[CONTACT_127891] a CR unt il data become available demonstrating a 
clear difference in patient outcome.  
Partial Remission (PR)  
1. ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to [ADDRESS_1051343] 
dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes or masses should be selected 
according to the following: (a) they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 
perpendicular dimensions; (b) if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; (c) they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever 
these sites are involved. 
2. No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen. 
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥
 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, 
in the greatest transverse diameter. 
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.

  5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive prior to treatment.  However, if positive, the cell type should be specified 
(e.g., large-cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells).  Patients who achieve a complete 
remission by [CONTACT_86950], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial responders. 
6. No new sites of disease should be observed (e.g., nodes >
 1.5 cm in any axis). 
7. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma : for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the 
PET scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET should be positive in at least one previously involved site. 
8. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown : for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be used. 
9. In patients with follicular lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated with one or at most two 
residual masses that have regressed by [CONTACT_726] 50% on CT; those with more than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be considered partial 
responders. 
Stable Disease (SD)  
1. Failing to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but not fulfilling those for progressive 
disease (see below). 
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphomas : the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with 
no new areas of involvement on the post- treatment CT or PET. 
3. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown : for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan. 
Relapsed Disease (RD; after CR) or Progressive Disease (PD; for Patients 
with PR or SD)  
1. Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm, regardless of 
the short axis.  If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1− 1.5 cm, it should only be 
considered abnormal if its short axis is > 1.0.  Lymph nodes ≤ 1.0 cm by ≤ 1.0 cm will not 
be considered as abnormal for relapse or progressive disease. 
2. Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of 
therapy, even if other lesions are decreas ing in size.  Increased FDG uptake in a 
previously unaffected site should only be considered relapsed or progressive disease after confirmation with other modalities.

  3. At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules).  
To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of 
less than 1.[ADDRESS_1051344] increase by ≥ 50% and to a size of 1.5 × 1.[ADDRESS_1051345] a 50% increase in the longest diam eter of any single previously identified node 
more than 1 cm in its short axis. 
5. Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359]-avid lymphoma or the 
lesion was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with 
current PET systems (< [ADDRESS_1051346]). 
6. Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that 
for nodal disease.  For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease.

Anaphylaxis Management 
The following equipment is needed in the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction 
during study drug infusion: 
• Appropriate monitors (electrocardio gram, blood pressure, pulse oximetry 
• Oxygen 
• Tourniquet • Epi[INVESTIGATOR_27837], intramuscular, and/or endotracheal administration 
in accordance with institutional guidelines.   
• Antihistamines 
• Corticosteroids 
• Intravenous infusion solutions, tubing, catheters, and tape 
 
The following are the procedures to follow in the event of a suspected anaphylactic 
reaction during study drug infusion: 
• Stop the study drug infusion. 
• Call for additional assistance! 
• Apply a tourniquet proximal to the injection site to slow systemic absorption of study 
drug.  Do not obstruct arterial flow in the limb. 
• Maintain an adequate airway. 
• Ensure that appropriate monitoring is in place, with continuous electrocardiogram and 
pulse oximetry monitoring, if possible. 
• Administer antihistamines, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], or other medications as required by [CONTACT_27964]. 
• Continue to observe the patient and document observations.

Recommendations for the Use of White Blood Cell Growth 
Factors 
Primary Prophylactic G-CSF Administration (First and Subsequent-Cycle Use)  
Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF is recommended if any of the following clinical factors 
are present: 
• Age >65 years 
• Poor performance status 
• Previous history of febrile neutropenia 
• Open wounds or active infections • More advanced cancer 
• Extensive prior treatment, includi ng large radiation therapy ports 
• Cytopenias due to bone marrow involvement by [CONTACT_20150] 
• Other serious comorbidities 
 
Secondary Prophylactic G-CSF Administration
 
Prophylactic G-CSF administration is recommended for patients who fulfill each of the 
following circumstances: 
• Experienced a neutropenic complication from a prior cycle of study treatment 
• Primary prophylactic G-CSF was not received; and 
• The intent is to avoid dose reduction of the antibody −drug conjugate (ADC), where 
the effect of the reduced dose on disease-free, overall survival or treatment 
outcome is not known 
 
Therapeutic Use of G-CSF  
G-CSF administration should be considered for the following patients: 
• Patients with febrile neutropenia who are at high risk for infection-associated 
complications; or 
• Patients who have prognostic factors that are predictive of poor clinical outcome, 
e.g., prolonged (>10 days) and profound (<100/ μL) neutropenia, age >65 years, 
uncontrolled primary disease, pneumonia, hypotension and multi-organ dysfunction 
(sepsis), invasive fungal infection, being hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766176]:  Smith TJ et al. 2006 Update of Re commendations for the use of White Blood Cell

PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES Due to the current study design and safety profile of this test product, no interim analyses are planned. STATISTICS Primary Analysis Plan McNemar’s tests will be performed to evaluate whether there is a statistically significant difference in nausea response (dichotomously scored as present or absent) across test product (intranasal naloxone) and control product (intranasal placebo) conditions.

Version #: 1.0 Version Date: [ADDRESS_736891] no nausea responses under the alternative hypothesis. In terms of probability, “no responses” implies a probability of 0: In other words, an impossible event. A single nausea response to the test product would decisively refute the null. But nausea responses, under either condition, are not literally impossible. We have therefore powered against the expected value of 0 by [CONTACT_560717] r = [ADDRESS_736892] of the usual point value. The beta with r = [ADDRESS_736893] of the density on the extreme values. Specifically, for values of p from .01 to .99, in .01 increments, we calculated the ordinate of the beta distribution with trial values of N; calculated the one-tailed rejection region (outcomes of fewer than 0 nausea responses were not considered) for that value of p and N; calculated the power for that N and an alternative value of p (e.g., .4); then used the corresponding ordinate for each value of p as a weight, and calculated the average across the range from .[ADDRESS_736894] used the corresponding Bayesian priors. The beta prior with r = N/10, for example, will concentrate probability on values near .1, whereas that with r = [ADDRESS_736895] to us, an N of 24 will suffice for 80%+ power. (Following from the above rationale, the entries in the table below do not correspond to standard power calculations for the McNemar test. The test for 0% vs. 40%, for example, is a test of whether the percentages for the two populations are both 20%; the power of this test is just 1 of 99 values averaged, with weights from the beta distribution, for the results in the table below). % Endorsing Nausea Number Needed (N) Power to detect difference Control Product Test Product 0% 20% 20 .811 0% 30% 12 .823 0% 40% 9 .844 10% 40% 16 .817 20% 50% 21 .805 30% 60% 24 .805 Reference: Uebersax, J.S.

  1 BACKGROUND Opi[INVESTIGATOR_40500], such as intravenously and intranasally delivered naloxone (brand name: [CONTACT_560740]), are used clinically throughout the US to acutely reverse opi[INVESTIGATOR_560667]4–6. A nasal naloxone spray device was recently approved for opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]: http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm473505.htm. Intranasal naloxone administration has been effectively completed by [CONTACT_560718]-medical trained professionals7. Depot naloxone injections, as well as an oral formulation (naltrexone) are used throughout the US as ongoing treatments to promote sobriety among individuals with substance use disorders8. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_560668], such as nausea, sweating, and jitteriness. Associations between the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_560669]- documented9–12. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders – 5th edition outlines criteria for substance dependence, and several self-report measures have been constructed to diagnose substance use disorders. In the past [ADDRESS_736896] considered other substances (i.e., illicit drugs, alcohol13,14). Food addiction has been proposed as a phenotype in obesity15,16, and more than 30% of treatment-seeking individuals with obesity endorse compulsive overeating17,18, defined as the consumption of large amounts of food whilst feeling out of control over one’s eating. The endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_560670], specifically, µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_418156], plays a critical role in the neural experience of reward that follows from eating highly palatable food9,19, especially foods high in sugars10,20,21. Eating these foods acutely stimulates the release of endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which, in turn, promotes further eating. Chronic overeating of these highly palatable and possibly addictive foods21–23 can alter µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_560671], and intensify experiences of, food cravings24–27. In short-term experimental studies, rats chronically consuming a highly palatable diet that are then either removed from this diet or administered an µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_560672]- withdrawal behavior10. Animal studies also show that administration of a µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_560673]-term ingestion of highly palatable, sweet food, even using doses of a µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_560674]21,28. One phase II placebo-controlled 24-week study (N = 138) of intranasal naloxone for binge eating disorder has been reported in abstract form at the American Psychiatric Association’s 166th annual meeting, but has not been published29. It involved intranasal naloxone (2 mg) (or intranasal placebo) before binge eating up to 2 times daily (up to 4 mg intranasal naloxone total daily). Eighty-one percent of subjects completed the trial, and there were no serious adverse events. Results indicated that naloxone, relative to placebo, resulted in less time spent binge eating and greater weight loss from weeks 12 to 24. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). We have published data showing that overweight and obese women who report nausea (a common opi[INVESTIGATOR_560675]30) following ingestion of a standard [ADDRESS_736897]-driven, and/or binge eating1,2,32. Thus, antagonizing the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_560676] a promising method

From Package Insert: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Studies in animals to assess the carcinogenic potential of naloxone hydrochloride have not been conducted. Naloxone hydrochloride was weakly positive in the Ames mutagenicity and in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test but was negative in the in vitro Chinese hamster V79 cell HGPRT mutagenicity assay and in the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosome aberration study. Reproduction studies conducted in mice and rats at doses 4-times and 8-times, respectively, the dose of a 50 kg human given 10 mg/ day (when based on surface area or mg/m2), demonstrated no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects due to naloxone hydrochloride.  From Package Insert: Use in Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: Teratology studies conducted in mice and rats at doses 4-times and 8-times, respectively, the dose of a 50 kg human given 10 mg/day (when based on surface area or mg/m2), demonstrated no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects due to naloxone hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, naloxone hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.  1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies From Package Insert: Pharmacokinetics: Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination Following parenteral administration, naloxone is distributed in the body and readily crosses the placenta. Plasma protein binding occurs but is relatively weak. Plasma albumin is the major binding constituent, but significant binding of naloxone also occurs to plasma constituents other than albumin. It is not known whether naloxone is excreted into human milk. Naloxone hydrochloride is metabolized in the liver, primarily by [CONTACT_518350]-3-glucoronide as the major metabolite. In one study the serum half-life in adults ranged from 30 to 81 minutes (mean 64 ± 12 minutes). In a neonatal study the mean plasma half-life was observed to be 3.1 ± 0.5 hours. After an oral or intravenous dose, about 25-40% of the drug is excreted as metabolites in urine within 6 hours, about 50% in 24 hours, and 60-70% in 72 hours.

  From Package Inserts: Clinical Pharmacology Naloxone hydrochloride prevents or reverses the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_560677], sedation, and hypotension. It can also reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects of agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine. Naloxone hydrochloride is an essentially pure opi[INVESTIGATOR_9727], i.e., it does not possess the “agonistic” or morphine- like properties characteristic of other opi[INVESTIGATOR_40500]. When administered in usual doses and in the absence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_560678], it exhibits essentially no pharmacologic activity. Naloxone hydrochloride has not been shown to produce tolerance or cause physical or psychological dependence. In the presence of physical dependence on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], naloxone hydrochloride will produce withdrawal symptoms. However, in the presence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], opi[INVESTIGATOR_560679] 2 hours. The severity and duration of the withdrawal syndrome are related to the dose of naloxone hydrochloride and to the degree and type of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561].  From Published Research: Route of Administration Recent research indicates that intranasal administration (IN) is similar in effectiveness to IM delivery in reversing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (heroin) overdose33. IN administration is considered an effective option in the treatment of overdose when IV administration is impossible or undesirable5. Animal data indicate that the peak plasma levels following intranasal delivery occurs within 3 minutes of administration34.  Figure 1. Structure of naloxone hydrochloride.  2 STUDY RATIONALE More than 30% of individuals who are overweight or obese and seeking treatment for weight loss endorse problems with binge-like, compulsive overeating17,18. A large body of research has documented overlaps between the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_560680]9–12, and in the past decade, food addiction has been proposed as a phenotype in obesity15,16. Data show that women are more sensitive to exogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_560661], as defined by [CONTACT_560719]-like effects more often than men35,36.  We have published data showing that overweight and obese women who report nausea (a common opi[INVESTIGATOR_560675]30) following ingestion of a standard [ADDRESS_736899]-driven, and/or

Version #: 1.0 Version Date: [ADDRESS_736900] weight loss intervention. Both studies1,2, however, used oral administration (naltrexone), which required three hours of observation to capture data from the time period involving peak response31. Thus, antagonizing the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_560676] a promising method by [CONTACT_560720] µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_560681].  Intranasal naloxone has been shown to achieve peak plasma levels in [ADDRESS_736901] burden. Hence, to (1) reduce the amount of time needed to investigate associations between eating behavior, obesity, and the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_59791], thereby [CONTACT_560711], and (2) take the initial steps toward the development of a cost- and time-effective method to assess endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_560663], we plan to evaluate the use of naloxone hydrochloride administered intranasally (intranasal naloxone). This study will provide important preliminary data for future studies investigating treatment matching for weight loss interventions. The development of an intranasal naloxone protocol may contribute to the identification of individuals who may benefit from the incorporation of intervention components traditionally used in substance misuse treatment (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]) into their weight-loss intervention program.  2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment The most significant potential benefit of this study is to contribute to the development of an inexpensive, non-invasive method for assessing endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_560682]. This study will generate key preliminary data for investigating this method, which may prove useful in identifying individuals with obesity who engage in binge-like, compulsive overeating (“opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-mediated eating”) that requires treatment modalities traditionally used to treat substance dependence disorders. Intranasal Naloxone-related risks Intranasal naloxone is known to reverse (and is used for the purpose of reversing) opi[INVESTIGATOR_560683] (e.g., for pain)4–6,37. Intranasal naloxone has minimal dug interaction potential5. Intranasal naloxone is not used as a continuous medication and is used in acute situations involving overdose, meaning that individuals receiving intranasal naloxone are not tested for the use of other medications prior to receiving it. See Appendix A for package insert.  3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  3.1 Primary Objective 1.

An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product. An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure. The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs during each subject visit and record the information in the Adverse Event Accountability Log (Appendix I) and in the subject’s CRF. Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause. AE Severity The guidelines shown in Table below should be used to grade severity. It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious. 
Protocol Number: HECHTMASON1 Confidential 
Version #: 1.0 Version Date: 15 January 2016 Page 27 of 54  
 Table 3. AE Severity Grading  Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well. Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required. Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125]. Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  AE Relationship to Study Drug The relationship of an AE to the study agent should be assessed using the following the guidelines in Table . Table 4. AE Relationship to Study Drug  Relationship to Drug Comment Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846]. Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978]. Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. Unrelated An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study drug.  11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE) An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 1. death 2. a life-threatening adverse experience 3. inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 4. a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 5. a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.

 11.2.1 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting All SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) will be documented per UCSF CHR (IRB) Guidelines (http://www.research.ucsf.edu/chr/guide/Violation_Incident_Guidelines.asp). The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit (visit 2) have been completed. In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site investigator will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC.  11.3 Medical Monitoring Frederick M.

 15.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint McNemar’s tests will be performed to evaluate whether there is a statistically significant difference in nausea response (dichotomously scored as present or absent) across the test product (intranasal naloxone) and control product (intranasal placebo) conditions.  15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  Linear mixed effects regression modeling will be performed to assess differences across conditions in rate of cortisol change over the course of all assessments (baseline and [ADDRESS_736943]-administration).  15.[ADDRESS_736944] no nausea responses under the alternative. In terms of probability, “no responses” implies a probability of 0: In other words, an impossible event. A single nausea response to intranasal naloxone would decisively refute the null. But nausea responses, under either condition, are not literally impossible. We have therefore powered against the expected value of 0 by [CONTACT_560717] r = [ADDRESS_736945] of the usual point value. The beta with r = [ADDRESS_736946] of the density on the extreme values. Specifically, for values of p from .01 to .99, in .01 increments, we calculated the ordinate of the beta distribution with trial values of N; calculated the one-tailed rejection region (outcomes of fewer than 0 nausea responses were not considered) for that value of p and N; calculated the power for that N and an alternative value of p (e.g., .4); then used the corresponding ordinate for each value of p as a weight, and calculated the average across the range from .[ADDRESS_736947] used the corresponding Bayesian priors. The beta prior with r = N/10, for example, will concentrate probability on values near .1, whereas that with r = [ADDRESS_736948] to us, an N of 24 will suffice for 80%+ power. (Following from the above rationale, the entries in the table below do not correspond to standard power calculations for the McNemar test. The test for 0% vs. 40%, for example, is a test of whether the percentages for the two populations are both 20%; the power of this test is just 1 of 99 values averaged, with weights from the beta distribution, for the results in the table below). % Endorsing Nausea Number Needed (N) Power to detect difference Control Product Test Product 0% 20% 20 .811 0% 30% 12 .823 0% 40% 9 .844 10% 40% 16 .817

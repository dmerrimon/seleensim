Page 1 of 181)Protocol TitleSt. George K01: Family-based eHealth Obesity Prevention Intervention for Hispanic Adolescents2)IRB Review History*This study was approved on 6/14/2016.3)Objectives*Because Hispanic adults and adolescents are most likely to access the internet from smartphones, an innovative way to package family-based interventions for Hispanic families may be through the use of web and mobile phone technology (eHealth). Previous eHealth interventions for improving adolescent physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet show promise; however, these approaches have largely targeted individual adolescents only (e.g., through computer/ video games) with limited parental involvement. Integrating family-related constructs, such as family functioning, more directly within eHealth interventions, particularly those targeting Hispanics, may thus improve their efficacy and effectiveness. As such, the specific aims of this study are:  AIM 1: To conduct formative research which will inform the development of a family-based eHealth obesity prevention intervention for increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, decreasing sedentary behavior, and improving quality dietary intake in Hispanic adolescents. To accomplish this aim, we will employ a user-centered design approach to integrate the perspectives of Hispanic parent-adolescent dyads during the intervention development process. Specifically, we will: 1a) conduct four focus groups and/or individual interviews with 20 Hispanic parents and adolescents to assess the needs and capabilities of the target audience; 1b) develop visual mockups of the intervention known as “paper prototypes” and iteratively revise and retest them through collecting usability and user feedback data from three groups of 5 Hispanic parent-adolescent dyads; 1c) develop a fully functional intervention prototype; and 1d) conduct a field trial with 10 Hispanic parent-adolescent dyads using the fully functional eHealth intervention prototype to refine intervention content and usability accordingly.AIM 2: To conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_619228], acceptability, and preliminary effects of a family-based eHealth obesity prevention intervention for increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, decreasing sedentary behavior, and improving quality dietary intake in Hispanic adolescents. To accomplish this aim, we will: 2a) recruit 50 parent-adolescent dyads; and 2b) randomize dyads to a family-based eHealth intervention or digital standard of care. It is hypothesized that the experimental intervention will be feasible, acceptable, and show promising effects vs. digital standard of care in increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, decreasing sedentary behavior, and improving quality dietary intake in adolescents at post intervention and a [ADDRESS_823131] of condition on outcomes. -       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

Page 2 of 184)Background*Obesity is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) among adolescents, with 34.5% of 12-19 year olds currently overweight or obese. These rates are disproportionately higher in ethnic minority adolescents, including Hispanics, 38% of whom are overweight or obese compared to 31% of non-Hispanic Whites. Although engaging in physical activity and healthy dietary behaviors in adolescence reduces CVD risk, only 26% of Hispanic adolescents are physically active for 60 minutes/day and nearly 40% watch ≥3 hours/day of television. The diets of Hispanic adolescents have also been shown to contain high levels of fat and added sugar, and low levels of fruits and vegetables. Effective preventive interventions are thus urgently needed to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors in this population.Ecological models of pediatric obesity consistently underscore the important role of the family system, which may serve to offset risks in other domains. In fact, meta-analyses of pediatric obesity interventions often conclude that family-based programs, or those that involve parents, are among the most efficacious. Family-based interventions may be especially relevant for Hispanics due to familismo, or a strong commitment to the family system. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_619229], however, there is surprisingly little research examining the effects of family-based obesity prevention programs in Hispanic adolescents.An innovative way to package family-based obesity prevention interventions for Hispanic families may be through the use of web and mobile phone technology. Technology use has become pervasive, with data from nationally representative surveys indicating 84% of adults and 95% of adolescents access the internet. Surprisingly, Hispanics (76%) are more likely than non-Hispanic White internet users (60%) to access the internet from a mobile device. The use of eHealth interventions thus presents a highly promising and viable option for delivering family-based obesity prevention interventions to Hispanic parents and adolescents.Systematic reviews of eHealth interventions for adolescent physical activity, sedentary behavior, and dietary change published in the last five years suggest they are feasible, acceptable, and demonstrate some improvements in healthy lifestyle behaviors. These interventions, however, have been largely targeted towards individual adolescents (e.g., through computer/video games) with limited or no parental involvement, which may account for their generally small and/or lack of sustained effects. When parental involvement has been integrated, it has generally included health education only (e.g., healthy recipes). One exception is a recent web-based intervention for mother-daughter dyads living in public housing which targeted improvements in family communication and demonstrated significant improvements in girls’ fruit intake and mothers’ physical activity and vegetable intake. To date, only two other adolescent obesity-related interventions have targeted improvements in family processes such as positive parenting using an eHealth approach; both of these, however, were treatment (not prevention) studies for African American adolescents. Integrating family functioning more directly within eHealth interventions, particularly those targeting Hispanics, may enhance their efficacy and effectiveness, but more research is needed.In summary, given the dearth of research on family-based approaches for obesity prevention in Hispanic adolescents, this study will provide novel and significant information regarding the development and preliminary effects of a family-based eHealth obesity prevention intervention that integrates web and mobile phone technology. -       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

Aim 1 employs a user-centered design approach to elicit feedback from members of the target population throughout the intervention development process across three phases: focus groups and/or individual interviews, testing of paper prototypes, and a field trial. Aim 2 (the fourth and final phase) is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_183511] a family-based eHealth obesity prevention intervention. All inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below (with the exception of exclusion criteria “e,” applied to Aim 2 participants only), will apply to all study participants: Inclusion criteria: (a) Female and male adolescents whose primary caregiver self-identifies as Hispanic  (b) Adolescent is between the ages of 12-15; (c) Adolescent lives with an adult primary caregiver willing to participate; (d) Both parent and adolescent own a smartphone with internet access; (e) Adolescent does not meet recommendations for fruit and vegetable intake (proxy for overall diet quality) as determined by a validated two-item screener; (f) Adolescent does not meet physical activity guidelines as determined by [CONTACT_619240] a validated two-item screener AND self-reports engaging in >2 hours/day of screen time (proxy for overall sedentary behavior) using three items.

Only staff members approved on both study protocols will contact [CONTACT_619243]. In the case of previous University of Miami studies already closed on eProst (to which we cannot add our staff members), we will list their eProst protocol numbers here: 20180944. We will also obtain a list of potentially eligible participants from the UM Consent to Contact [CONTACT_2302]. The following criteria (or similar) will be used to generate the patient contact [CONTACT_4111]: Healthy volunteers, Hispanic, Parent of a young teen (12-15 years of age). After receiving the lists of potentially eligible participants, study staff will contact [CONTACT_619244]. We will additionally recruit families through word-of-mouth, referrals from families who participated in previous phases of the study, and through posting ads on social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) and flyers (See “Healthy Juntos Flyer”) in various locations throughout the community (See “Media Tool Kit: Brochure, Flyer and Palm card”). For those who learn of the study via social media, they will first be asked to provide their electronic consent to a brief online eligibility pre-screener (See “Online Eligibility Pre-Screener”). Once consent has been provided, individuals will be directed to the pre-screener in the project’s landing page, the responses to which will be captured in REDCap. Study staff will review all completed online pre-screeners and determine whether respondents appear to meet preliminary eligibility criteria. Study staff will call the respondents who meet the preliminary criteria to complete the screening process. Participating families will be encouraged to have interested friends contact [CONTACT_619245] $10 for every referral of a potentially eligible family received.Recruitment will occur over a four year period and will include multiple waves corresponding to each of four phases of the study: focus groups and/or individual interviews (n=20), testing of paper prototypes (n=15), field trial (n=10), and pi[INVESTIGATOR_37087] (n=50). To recruit families from the pediatric primary care clinics, a point person from each clinic will work with study staff members to identify Hispanic adolescents (and their caregivers) scheduled for a doctor’s visit. The clinic staff will inform study staff at least one day in advance whether a Hispanic adolescent between the ages of 12 and 15 is scheduled to visit the clinic. During the family’s medical appointment, providers will ask the family whether they are interested in learning more about a study to improve healthy lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity and nutrition among Hispanic adolescents. If the family is interested, they will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_619246]. Families who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are interested in participating will be given a detailed description of the study by [CONTACT_200252]. Prior to data collection, participants will complete an informed assent form (adolescents) and an informed consent form (caregivers) either in-person or remotely. To avoid coercion of the adolescent by [CONTACT_7071], we will ask parents give the adolescent privacy. In case the -       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

We will work with technologists from a technology research center to create visual mockups, known as “paper prototypes,” and a fully functional intervention prototype. We will employ a user-centered design approach, or an iterative process whereby [CONTACT_619247]. The user-centered design process in this study will include focus groups and/or individual interviews, development and testing of initial paper prototypes to create a fully functional prototype, and a field trial for testing the fully functional prototype. Procedures for each of these phases of the user-centered design approach are detailed below: Aim 1, Phase 1: Focus Groups and/or individual interviews. We will first conduct four focus groups (2 parent-only and 2 adolescent-only groups; 10 individuals/group) and/or a series of individual interviews to inform intervention content and technical development. Prior to focus group and/or individual interview sessions, participants will complete brief questionnaires including demographic items and items about their technology use. Participants will also have their height and weight measured by [CONTACT_464] (or by a medical provider at their primary care clinic). Height will be measured using a stadiometer. Weight will be measured using a digital scale.During focus group and/or individual interview sessions, parents and adolescents will be asked a series of questions designed to understand how they currently use technology for their health, how they define a healthy lifestyle, how they participate in healthy lifestyle activities with their families, and what they think of the research team’s ideas to develop an eHealth intervention (see “Focus Group/Interview Question Guide”). Focus groups and/or individual interviews will be guided by [CONTACT_619248]/or individual interviews with Hispanics (e.g., bilingual facilitator), will be conducted at either the researchers’ office, an office in one of the primary care clinics, the participants’ home, by [CONTACT_648], or by [CONTACT_217334], will last 1-2 hours, and will be audio-recorded and then transcribed by [CONTACT_619249] -       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

Aim 1, Phase 2: Testing of Paper Prototypes: We will then iteratively collect usability and user feedback data from parent-adolescent dyads. Prior to formal consenting/assenting procedures, parents and adolescents will provide verbal consent to have the adolescents’ height and weight measured by [CONTACT_619250]. Height will be measured using a stadiometer. Weight will be measured using a digital scale. Once participants formally consent for the study, parents will also have their height and weight measured and recorded. Parents and adolescents (separately) will then be shown paper and minimally-functioning versions of the intervention and asked to interact with them by [CONTACT_619251]/links they might select. As they interact with the prototypes, they will be presented with the next “screen” and asked to “think aloud” as they make their selections (see “Paper Prototype Interview Guide”). The “think aloud” method is used to understand participants’ navigation of websites, identify problems early in the design process, and develop suggestions for improvement. They will additionally be asked general questions related to what they liked most/least about the prototypes, how they might be improved, and how likely they would be to use a website that looked like the prototypes.  Finally, participants will complete a brief demographic survey and a measure of the prototype’s usefulness and ease of use (see “USE Questionnaire”). The entire session will be conducted at either the researchers’ office, an office in one of the primary care clinics, the participants’ home, or a location of the participants’ choosing that offers privacy (e.g., a private room at the participants’ local library) will last 1-2 hours and will be audio-recorded and transcribed by [CONTACT_619252]. Potential flaws to the eHealth intervention will be identified and corrected as participants provide feedback. Data gathered during paper prototype testing will then be used to create a fully functional intervention prototype. Aim 1, Phase 3 Field trial:  During the final phase of formative testing, we will conduct a field trial using the fully functional eHealth intervention prototype. Field trials involve the collection of data in users’ natural environments and can evaluate technology for flaws that will only emerge through use over time. Participants will be instructed to wear a physical activity monitor and interact with the intervention using their own smartphones and/or computers over the course of eight weeks. Prior to formal consenting/assenting procedures, parents and adolescents will provide their height and weight. Following the informed consent/assent process, participants will be asked to complete a brief demographic survey. Study team members will then provide an overview of smartphone security education to each participant (see “Smartphone Security Tips Checklist”), show participants how to log in to and use the program, and review the intervention terms of service and privacy policy following log-in.At the end of each week, participants will be asked to complete a brief electronic survey that asks them to rate weekly content, including what they liked/disliked and would change about each session (see “Field Trial Weekly Questions”). At the end of the eight weeks, participants will be asked to complete a brief survey and a final interview to discuss their overall experience using the entire program (see “USE questionnaire and “Field Trial Final Interview Question Guide”). The final interview session will be conducted by [CONTACT_45933], will last 1–2 hours, and will be video or audio-recorded and -       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

The pi[INVESTIGATOR_570783] a mixed design with two levels of intervention (family-based eHealth intervention and digital standard of care comparison) as the between subjects factor and two repeated measures (T1=baseline, T2=post-intervention) as the within-subjects factor. To confirm adolescent’s eligibility for this phase of the study, parents and adolescents will provide verbal consent to have the adolescents’ height and weight measured by [CONTACT_464]. Once participants formally consent for the study, parents will also have their height and weight measured and recorded. During each time point, the following measures will be collected from both parents and adolescents. Participants will complete questionnaires using their own smartphones or desktop computers.Body Measures:  Height will be measured using a stadiometer. Weight will be measured using a digital scale or a bioimpedance scale. Waist circumference will be measured using a tape measure. Body composition will be obtained with a bioimpedance scale. Each measurement will be taken at least twice. Lifestyle Behaviors (for eHealth intervention condition ONLY):  Daily steps and dietary intake will be measured using a wrist-worn device. Participants will wear the monitor all day and night for the first two months, only removing it to shower and do other activities, such as swimming, where the monitor would be underwater. Participants may receive phone calls to check on compliance with wearing the monitor (see “Instructions for Physical Activity Monitor”).Questionnaires: Parents and adolescents will complete self-reported questionnaires that assess constructs including demographics, physical activity, dietary intake, parenting practices, family relations, parent-adolescent communication, acculturation, and motivation (see “Parent Measures Packet” and “Adolescent Measures Packet”).Once families complete the baseline assessment, they will be randomized (1:1) into one of two possible study groups, eHealth Intervention or digital standard of care. Participants will be informed of their group assignment by [CONTACT_648]. eHealth Intervention Group: Participating parents and adolescents will receive a wrist-worn physical activity tracker (Fitbit). Study team members will provide an overview of smartphone security education to each participant (see “Smartphone Security Tips Checklist”), show participants how to log in to and use the program, and review the intervention terms of service and privacy policy following log-in. Families randomized to the eHealth intervention will be log in to a secured website for approximately 45 minutes each week for a total of eight weeks. The eHealth intervention will be delivered primarily through smartphones but will be developed using a responsive web design, or one that “responds” to the users’ device (e.g., smartphone, computer) by [CONTACT_619253] (e.g., image resolution, size). This design will provide participants with flexibility in engaging with intervention content. The website will include didactic content on healthy lifestyle behaviors (for parents/adolescents), a family behavior change tool for setting weekly goals (for parents/adolescents), and a positive parenting tool (for -       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

A HIPAA-compliant secure server architecture will be developed in support of the program described above. This will consist of an industry-standard Ubuntu Linux server using Ruby [CONTACT_619254].In addition, and to increase participant compliance/reduce attrition often observed in eHealth interventions, human support (“supportive accountability”) will be provided weekly. Each family will be assigned a “coach” who will use video conferencing software or phone to engage in a 15-30 minute conversation regarding their family’s progress. Sessions may be recorded for the purposes of training and supervision. No recording will be done without participant’s prior knowledge and consent.At the end of each week, participants will be asked to complete a brief electronic survey that asks them to rate weekly content, including what they liked/disliked and would change about each session (see “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_619232]”). At the end of the eight weeks, participants will be asked to complete a brief electronic survey (see “USE questionnaire”). In addition, a randomly-selected subset of participants (n=12-15) assigned to the intervention condition will be asked to complete a final interview to discuss their overall experience using the entire program (see “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_619233]”). The final interview session will be conducted by [CONTACT_45933], will last 1–[ADDRESS_823138] of Care Group: Families randomized to digital standard of care will receive a list of free health apps and publicly available health websites (see “Digital Health Resource List”).

In addition to the standard measures, participants will be asked to complete a brief electronic survey about their experience using the listed apps and websites at [ADDRESS_823139] baseline (see “Digital Standard of Care Survey”).   11)Data and Specimen Banking*NA – no specimens will be collected.12)Data Management*Aim 1 of this study employs a user-centered design approach to elicit feedback from members of the target population at various stages throughout the intervention development process. All qualitative data gathered throughout this process (focus groups and/or individual interviews, testing of paper prototypes, field trial) will be transcribed by [CONTACT_619252]. Once transcripts are completed, data will be analyzed using a rapid assessment and/or general inductive approach to derive themes. A general inductive approach is a systematic procedure that entails multiple readings and interpretations of transcripts reflective of participant responses. Although findings are influenced by [CONTACT_619256], findings will be derived directly from the raw data (i.e., participants’ comments). Study staff members will read all transcripts in detail and will iteratively develop a comprehensive code book outlining all category labels and descriptions. The code book, along with predefined decision rules, will guide the process of coding. A qualitative software program will be used to perform a content analysis.-       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

After conducting the latent growth analysis, the model-estimated outcomes will also be plotted (by [CONTACT_3004]) to visualize trajectories over time by [CONTACT_3004]. This same procedure will be used to examine secondary parent outcomes. Finally, exploratory mediation analyses will be conducted using the "product of coefficients" test to examine whether the effects of condition on the outcomes will be partially mediated by [CONTACT_619260].13)Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects*We do not expect for this study to create more than minimal risk for participating families; however, the study will be monitored for safety by [CONTACT_30967].14)Withdrawal of Subjects*Families will be informed that their participation in the study is completely voluntary and that they have the right to withdraw at any time without any negative consequences. Circumstances under which participants will be withdrawn from the study include: the parent or adolescent is arrested, reports suicidal ideation, or experiences some other extreme adverse event. If a participant is arrested, reports suicidal ideation, or some other extreme adverse event, a qualified study staff member (i.e., [CONTACT_619270]. George, a licensed psychologist) may ask them to withdraw from the study, and if appropriate, refer them to necessary services. According to IRB, if a participant becomes incarcerated while enrolled in a study, all research interactions and interventions with that participant, and the obtaining of identifiable private information about the participant must cease. -       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

Page 11 of 1815)Risks to Subjects*Potential risks to participants are described below by [CONTACT_307340]: Aim 1 of this study employs a user-centered design approach to elicit feedback from members of the target population at various stages throughout the intervention development process.Participation in qualitative data collection (through focus groups and interviews): There is the potential for participants to be bothered by [CONTACT_619261], which may make them feel uncomfortable, angry, sad, or embarrassed. Participants might also feel fatigued after focus group or individual interview sessions.Body Measures (for Aim 1, Phases 1 and 2 ONLY): Participants will have their height and weight measured. Some concerns have been raised regarding potential adverse effects of anthropometric measurements used to assess body composition and categorize weight status. However, in 2010, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reiterated their earlier statement (2005) that no direct evidence supports potential harms such as poorer self-concept, eating disorder pathology, or mental health problems, and that these were not incurred by [CONTACT_619262] (USPSTF, 2010; Whitlock et al., 2005). There is the potential risk of embarrassment for girls undergoing anthropomorphic assessments; however, care will be taken to conduct this examination in private and to minimize discomfort.  Questionnaires: Participants will complete self-reported questionnaires. No side effects have been noted in the current literature in association with the self-reported assessments used in this study, although, as with many assessment batteries, some people may experience mild fatigue or momentary concern about their ability to perform well. Some participants may also feel embarrassed and/or bothered by [CONTACT_619263].Aim 2 is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_619231]-based eHealth obesity prevention intervention. Randomization to the eHealth intervention condition: There may be some discomfort from increasing physical activity levels or changing eating behaviors as a result of participation in the eHealth intervention condition.  The possibilities include, but are not limited to some muscle and joint stiffness. This stiffness generally subsides in 1 or 2 days, and is not considered to be serious.  Body Measures: Participants will have their height, weight, waist circumference, and body composition measured. See potential risks for body measures listed under Aim 1 above. Lifestyle Behaviors Measures: Participants will wear physical activity bands to monitor their physical activity levels. There is no known risk of injury associated with wearing the activity bands in this study. The bands are worn around the wrist like many commercially available bands, are small and unobtrusive, and should cause no discomfort.  Participants will be monitored to determine if they are experiencing discomfort due to wearing the devices. Questionnaires: See potential risks for questionnaires listed under Aim 1 above. -       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

Additionally, families may benefit through improvements in communication and family functioning. 17)Vulnerable Populations*The research involves youth under the age of 18. To avoid coercion or undue influence, adolescents will assent and complete study measures separately from their primary care giver(s). In case the adolescent refuses to assent, the family will be told they did not meet one or more of the inclusion/exclusion criteria; to avoid any consequences to the adolescent, study staff will not reveal to the parent that the adolescent did not assent.18)Multi-Site Research*NA – this study is not a multi-site study 19)Community-Based Participatory Research*NA – this study is not considered community-based participatory research 20)Sharing of Results with Subjects*NA – results of this study will not be shared with participants 21)SettingThe research team will identify and recruit potential participants from two pediatric primary care clinics affiliated with the University of Miami Health System, Jackson Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and a private pediatric primary care clinic in the community. The first is a mobile clinic that travels to underserved areas in South [LOCATION_012] to provide free medical care to underinsured, predominantly ethnic minority youth. The second clinic is located within Jackson Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], South [LOCATION_012]’s only public health hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and serves mostly ethnic minority youth. The third clinic is located on the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine campus. The fourth is a private practice in the community. All recruitment and consent/assent activities as well as data collection will occur either in-person or remotely (by [CONTACT_45933]).For Aim 2, all data collection at T1, T2, and T3 will occur at either the researchers’ office, an office in one of the primary care clinics, the participants’ home, or a location of the participants’ choosing that offers privacy (e.g., a private room at the participants’ local library). The intervention will be delivered online; thus, participants will most likely be in their homes or places with Internet access (e.g., school, library) to receive the intervention. -       Study #: 20160415        Effective Date: 6/8/2022

Page 18 of 18Participants who are not yet adults, including adolescents ages 12-15 participating in the present study will go through a similar process as their parents. Their age will be confirmed with the pediatric clinic and/or the primary caregiver. After the parent or primary caregiver has consented, study staff members will present the assent forms to the adolescent. We will ask caregivers to give the adolescent privacy to prevent the adolescents from being coerced to participate. The assent process will last approximately 30 minutes, but it may take youth more or less time depending on how clearly they comprehend study procedures.Cognitively Impaired Adults - NAAdults Unable to Consent – NAAuthorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (HIPAA) Patient medical records are being access for consent to contact [CONTACT_619268] a waiver of the requirement for written authorization from the patients to access their medical records.

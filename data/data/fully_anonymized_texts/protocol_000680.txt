Specific Aims  
Klinefelter’s syndrome (KS) (1) is a relatively common genetic disorder that 
occurs in 1/[ADDRESS_253808] 
that multiple facets of the KS phenotype will improve with early androgen replacement: 
working memory,  fine- and gross -motor coordination and speed , as well as self -esteem 
within the cognit ive and behavioral phenotypes and muscle strength within the physical 
phenotype.  
Klinefelter’s syndrome is well suited for interventional studies because the 
disorder is relatively common in males, testicular failure is nearly universal, and the 
physical and cognitive phenotypic features have been characterized. Early androgen 
replacement in physiologic rather than pharmacologic dosages is a reasonable, 
appropriate, and safe consideration in this population. Therapeutic interventions for this 
relatively co mmon disorder have not been forthcoming, and this represents a unique 
opportunity to replace a missing hormone and improve aspects of the cognitive and 
behavioral outcome.  The primary specific aim of this study will test the hypothesis that 
androgen repla cement in childhood is beneficial by [CONTACT_211928] -treated versus placebo KS groups.  If successful, androgen replacement 
would commence early in childhood rather than adolescence or adulthood in 
Klinefelter’s syndrome.  
 
Specific Aim 1 . Early androgen intervention, using a randomized clinical trial and 
treating for two years .  We will evaluate five primary outcome variables: general 
cognition, language summary score, Working memory/executive function summary 
score, Motor func tion summary score, and Self -image and social function summary 
score.  
Hypotheses  regarding five primary outcomes:  
1. Certain aspects of the KS physical, neurocognitive and behavioral phenotype will 
improve with childhood androgen replacement therapy.  
a. Th e working memory summary score will improve after two years  in the 
androgen -treated versus the placebo group.

treated versus the placebo group.  
c. The self -image summary score  will improve after two years  in the androgen -
treated versus the placebo group.  
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 Klinefelter’s syndrome (KS), first described in 1942 on the basis of testicular 
failure (1), occurs only in males, and is characterized by [CONTACT_211929] 47,XXY  (2).  Unlike other chromosomal trisomies, 47,XXY does not 
frequently cause spontaneous abortuses, most likely related to inactivation of the 
supranumerary X -chromosome occurring in many tissues. The KS phenotype includes 
testicular failure, tall stature, and a characteristic cognitive and behavioral phenotype. 
Other KS -associated phenotypic findings include increased risk for osteoporosis, breast 
cancer, autoimmune thyroid disorders, and Type II diabetes mellitus (3).  Most KS 
males were previously diagnosed in adolescence on the basis of testicular failure; 
however, increasing numbers are now detected through routine antenatal testing. 
Approximately 1 per 500 -1000 males are affected  (4).  Mosaicism for a normal 46,XY 
line occurs in approximately 10 -20% of KS cases and is associated with improved 
prognosis.  
I. Testicular failure phe notype  
The clinical spectrum for the testicular failure phenotype ranges from near 
complete androgen deficiency and gonadal failure starting prenatally to mild androgen 
deficiency with azoospermia in adulthood. Many KS boys have fetal onset of gonadal 
failure manifest by [CONTACT_211930]. Others manifest testicular failure in adolescence or 
adulthood. The in utero testosterone deficiency would likely occur in the last trimester 
because testosterone deficiency earlier in gestation would result in ambiguity of the 
external genitalia with hypospadias, which is not characteristic of KS. Rather, a burst of 
testosterone synthesis in the last trimester stimulates penile growth and it is t his later 
testosterone growth -stimulating effect on the genitalia that is missing in KS males.  
A clue for diagnosis of KS earlier in infancy or childhood is the presence of small penis 
and testes, as exemplified by a set of twins discordant for KS (5). The testes and penis of 
the KS affected twin only, as well as in KS boys evaluated in childhood, were small at birth 
and throughout adolescence (5). Gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_211917] (low) in 
childhood and tend to rise by [CONTACT_654] [ADDRESS_253809] early and severe ovarian 
failure are also normal in childhood and rise at age 10 -12 years (6).  
Other signs of testicular failure in adolescence include gynecomastia, eunuchoidal 
body proportion with relatively lo nger legs and increased arm span, decreased facial, 
pubic, and body hair, decreased muscle mass, and feminine distribution of body fat. 
Testosterone levels measured prenatally and in infancy in a small number of KS males 
were decreased or normal (7) and remained low -normal in childhood and adulthood (5). 
Testicular biopsy specimens of KS infants demonstrate decreased germ cells. After 
puberty, hyalinization and fibrosis of the seminiferous tubules occurs with small testes and 
PROTOCOL: Androgen Effects on Cognition in Klinefelter’s Syndrome, Control # 02F476, Judith Ross, M.D.            4 
 4 azoospermia. Thus, the extra X chromosome affec ts both testicular germ cells and 
interstitial cells.    
II. Physical phenotype  
KS boys tend to be tall (average adult height of 186 cm) (8), starting in infancy 
and childhood, with disproportionately long legs and arms and relatively small head 
circumference SDS compared to height SDS (4, 5, 9, 10) .  Their tall stature, mainly due 
to increased leg length, occurs in childhood and is likely related to 47,XXY males having 
a third copy of the X chromosome heig ht determining gene, SHOX, as well as delayed 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_211918]. The SHOX ( short 
stature homeob ox) gene was first identified as a major human growth determinant from 
molecular analysis of sex chromosome abnormal ities associated with short stature (11).  
Other sex chromosome trisomies, 47,XYY males and 47,XXX females, also tend be tall 
and have three copi[INVESTIGATOR_211919] (12). Skeletal anomalies associated with KS 
include osteoporosis, kyphosis, scoliosis, and pectus excavatum. KS males als o have 
an increased risk for central obesity, starting in childhood (8).  
III. Neurocognitive and behavioral phenotype  
KS males also have a neurocognitive and behavioral phenotype that is 
expressed early in childhood and persists into adulthood. The main features include 1. 
language -based learning disabilities, 2. impaired working memory/executive function, 
and attention, 3. impaired motor abilities and 4. a characteristic personality style. 
Important information about the natural history of cognitive development in this 
popul ation has been derived from several prospective, population -based longitudinal 
studies (8, 13 -15). In general, global intelligence is less than siblings  or controls (14), 
but Verbal IQ tends to be depressed relative to Performance IQ, both in children and 
adults (4, 14 -18). In contrast, visual -spatial abilities are generally within the average 
range.   
1. Language -based learning disabilities : KS children and adults have 
impairment of selective aspects of  receptive and expressive language processing. 
Delayed language and speech development is often detected by [CONTACT_654] 2 -3 (8, 19, 20) . 
These delays are predictive of later school problems with reading, spelling, writing, and 
problem solving that necessitate special education in childhood and adolescence (16, 
21).  Detailed studies of these language -based learning problems suggest underlying 
deficiencies in perception and short -term memory for sequential auditory information, 
limitations of phonemic processing, an d poor understanding of grammatical and 
morphological aspects of language.  Associated expressive language problems include 
poor word -retrieval, depressed verbal fluency, and limitations in the capacity to 
formulate narrative constructions (14, 15, 18) .  These difficulties in articulating and 
structuring language output as well as impaired verbal processing speed, and executive 
abilities persist into adulthood (17, 22 -24).   
2. Working memory/executive and attention dysfunction : 
Neurodevelopmental anomalies of attentional systems a re common. Attention deficits 
without hyperactivity (23,24)  occur in KS males with executive dysfunction and 
problems with working memory.  Androgen replacement in KS males has been 
associated with improved fluency (25). Also, we previously demonstrated that androgen 
replacement in girls with Turner syndrome (10 -14 years) who have androgen deficiency 
on the basis of ovarian failure was associated with improved working memory.  
PROTOCOL: Androgen Effects on Cognition in Klinefelter’s Syndrome, Control # 02F476, Judith Ross, M.D.            5 
 5 3. Motor a bilities : KS children and adults also have diminished neuromuscular integration 
with impaired gross motor and fine motor skills and coordination, speed, dexterity and 
strength  (14, 26) .  Young KS infants frequently had decreased motor to ne and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_211920] (27) and in childhood, balance, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_211921] (27). In 
addition, finger joint hypermobility and poor grasp specifically hinder writing skills (26). The 
motor impairments lead to  impaired eye -hand coordination, clumsiness and poor athletic 
skills, which in turn, have a negative impact on socialization and self -image.  
 
Evidence of impaired simple motor function in girls with Turner syndrome (TS) and 
improvement with oxandrolone tr eatment for two years (Figure 1) : We have included 
preliminary results from oxandrolone versus placebo treatment (0.06/mg/kg/day) of another 
androgen -deficient population: TS girls with ovarian failure, treated for 24 months [115] . 
Simple repetitive movement of the hand was assessed with subtests of the Physical and 
Neurological Evaluation for Soft Signs (PANESS). The time required to tap the thumb and 
forefinger 20 times and to tap the thumb to each of the 4 fingers sequentially 20 times was  
measured separately in the dominant (right  only) and nondominant (left only) hands. Results 
were converted to SD scores using data from age - and handedness -matched control females. 
The change in SD scores at year 1 and year 2 are shown (Figure 1). The androgen -treated 
TS group had significantly im proved simple repetitive movement of the hand (P < 0.05) after 
24, but not 12 months, compared to the placebo group. The mechanism of androgen effects 
may be through organization of neuronal processes and /or their growth and efficiency, 
perhaps in the pyr amidal and nonpyramidal areas. We propose to use the same treatment 
duration (24 months) in the KS population because statistically significant changes in this 
simple motor task were observed after 24 but not 12 months of treatment .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Persona lity development : There is also a psychosocial aspect of the KS phenotype 
affecting temperament and self -image.  By [CONTACT_211931], KS boys are relatively quiet, 
passive, and socially withdrawn. They have increased worries and fears as well as 
difficulties with  peer and sibling relationships (4). Their quiet, shy, and unassertive 
personalities place them at an increased risk for being bullied. Many boys have 
diminished self -esteem, as early as age [ADDRESS_253810] 
with others and decreased sexual libido (28, 29) . During adolescence, KS males were 
more prone to impulsivity, outbursts, and conflict than controls (30), suggesting that this 
is a particularly difficult time for them. When adults have been followed long term, the 
cognitive and behavioral findings remain, but there is no increase in criminality, major 
psychopathology, or homosexuality, compared to hypogonadal 46,XY males (8, 22, 31) .

 6 Certain psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, and psychosis are more 
common in KS (31) as well as a decreased likelihood for marriage.  One s tudy 
comparing KS adult males with 46,XY hypogonadal males reported increased 
immaturity, fatigue, social isolation, and delayed sexual milestones in the KS population 
(22). Both populations were androgen -deficient, but the deficiency may be more severe 
or longstanding in the KS population.  
Poor motor  coordination and athletic abilities impair normal development of 
positive self -esteem and increase anxiety and social isolation. The potential relationship 
of these social findings to the cognitive abnormalities is of great interest. Also, the 
contributio n of androgen deficiency to this physical and social profile is unknown. Early 
testosterone replacement may increase muscle strength and coordination and may aid 
peer identification, self -esteem, and social function.  
IV. Determinants of brain development i n KS males  
There appear to be early genetic effects of the additional X chromosome on brain 
growth and development, resulting in relative microcephaly at birth in KS males that 
persists and correlates with IQ. Support for relative microcephaly being relat ed to 
genetic rather than hormonal mechanisms comes from the genetic model of 47,XXX 
females (4, 32)  who are not androgen -deficient, but als o tend to have relatively small 
heads. In addition, both KS males and 47,XXX females have increased speech and 
language problems, decreased coordination, and increased academic difficulties (12).       
Neuroimaging studies of KS males have shown reduced left temporal gray matter, 
consistent with the verbal and language deficits, and reduced amygdala volumes which may 
be related to psychopathology or behavioral dysfunction of KS males (25, 33) .  The amygdala 
influences neuroendocrine, cognitive, and emotional aspects of information processing and is 
richly endowed with androgen and estrogen receptors. The volumes of the lateral ventricle and 
the amygdala increase with age in boys,  particularly at puberty (34). This particular finding may 
provide a neuroanatomic basi s for the KS shy temperament and passivity, while their poor 
phonemic processing and auditory memory may be related to alterations in left temporal lobe 
morphology (25).  
Language ability is asym metrically organized in the brain, with nearly all right 
handers and 50% of left handers demonstrating left hemisphere dominance.  
Corresponding volumetric asymmetries of the left perisylvian cortex include a larger left 
planum temporale which may relate t o increased neural representation devoted to the 
processing of sound -based representations of speech (35). Geschwind and Galaburda 
proposed that cerebral dominance for language is related to prenatal testosterone levels 
(36, 37) . Neuropsychological findings in KS males (38-40) suggest anomalous 
development of cerebral hemispheric asymmetry with greater right hemisphere 
involvement, perhaps related to slower fetal brain growth rates and the failure of the left 
hemisphere to gain dominance in language processing (40). Phonemic event related 
potentials (ERP), which reflect increased processing time for linguistic information 
correlate with verbal IQ in KS (38). These relationships lead to the speculation that the 
slower processing of the phonemic ERP reflects anomalous neural processing of 
speech related to anomalous cortical localization.  
The etiology may be androgen deficiency in utero and early in life, excess X -
chromosome gene dosage effects, or both.  
  
PROTOCOL: Androgen Effects on Cognition in Klinefelter’s Syndrome, Control # 02F476, Judith Ross, M.D.            [ADDRESS_253811] shown clear -cut structural effects of androgen on 
subcortical nuclear regions such as the hypothalamic/preoptic area as well as forebrain 
regions that are  related to behavior (41-43).  Androgen alterations during the perinatal period 
and puberty influence cognitive function and behavio r in animal and human models. Gonadal 
steroids during human fetal development also affect cerebral dominance development and 
may lead to certain gender differences in cognition. Numerous examples support an 
association between androgen and spatial ability and to a lesser extent, working memory, in 
humans.  Males generally outperform females in visual -spatial tasks involving mental rotation, 
spatial perception, spatial visualization, and problem solving, which all rely to some extent on 
working memory (44). Neuropsychological impairment occurs in subjects with androgen 
deficiency .  Men with untreated, congenital, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) have 
diminished production of testosterone as well as impaired spatial ability, verbal memory and 
attention relative to normal controls (45).  Yet, clear differences remain between 47,XXY KS 
males and 46,XY males with IHH, with the language - based learning disabilities being more 
characteristic of KS.  
Androgen replacement in KS males has been associated with improved fluency (39) and 
relatively increased left temporal cortical volumes (25). Working memory has been also been 
shown to respond to testosterone in elderly men who receive replacement ther apy (46).The 
cerebral cortex may remain plastic until adulthood, permitting changes to be induced by 
[CONTACT_97113]. Against early testosterone deficiency being the sole etiology for the KS cognitive 
phenotype is the model of androgen -deficient males with hypogonadism but normal 
chromosomes, who do not generally suffer from dyslexia or impaired language abilities.   
In contrast, the association between the self -image and social phenotypes in KS and 
androgen defi ciency is stronger. Androgen replacement may help in the areas of distractibility, 
mood, and psychosocial function (22, 47, 48) . Verbal IQs in KS adolescents were positively 
related to earlier pubertal onset and higher testosterone levels (49). Most KS adults treated 
with testosterone benefited, reporting improved endurance and strength, concentration, 
learning ability, and mood (22). In addition, testosterone replacement in normal males with 
delayed puberty has been associated with improved self -perceived  competence (47). What is 
not yet clear is what the optimal age for initiating testosterone treatment in KS males would 
be.  
VI. Genet ic mechanisms  
The extra X chromosome in KS is usually acquired though non -disjunction during 
maternal or paternal gametogenesis, occurring in the egg (40 -50%) or the sperm (50 -
PROTOCOL: Androgen Effects on Cognition in Klinefelter’s Syndrome, Control # 02F476, Judith Ross, M.D.            8 
 8 60%), or through an error in mitotic division in the zygote (50-52).  Maternal inheritance 
of the extra X results from non -disjunction in the first (70%) or second (20%) meiosis or 
as a post -zygotic mitotic error (10%), with increased maternal age and reduced 
recombination also occurring (51).  
VII. Early androgen replacement in KS  
In summary, the hormonal and genetic contributions to the KS phenotype remain 
to be defined more clearly. Early diagnosis, together wi th early parental education and 
counseling, and earlier testosterone replacement may contribute to positive adjustment 
and reduce the negative social, emotional, and education impact of KS. Further studies 
linking the hormonal and genetic mechanisms will i ncrease our understanding of the 
pathogenesis of KS and will permit more specific genetic counseling and interventions.  
The primary goal of this study is to test the effect of replacing the low levels of 
androgen in KS boys in an attempt to mimic the testo sterone production that occurs 
normally in boys. Clinical support for androgen deficiency occurring earlier in childhood in 
KS boys than previously thought comes from the poor growth of the penis throughout 
childhood in these boys. The “standard of medical  care” for initiating testosterone 
replacement therapy in KS males has typi[INVESTIGATOR_211922] 11 or 12  years or older (59). 
Testosterone treatments in KS teenagers or adults results in appropriate virilization with 
increased muscle mass, more masculine body contour, increased body hair, penile 
growth, and amelioration of eunu choidal tendencies.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], adult replacement doses of 200 mg of testosterone esters such as 
testosterone enanthate or cypi[INVESTIGATOR_211923] h igh adult -level, 
replacement dosages.  There are relatively few options for lower dose androgen 
replacement. One attractive consideration is the oral androgen oxandrolone which has 
been used safely in boys with delayed puberty and in girls with Turner synd rome for over 
twenty years and is FDA approved for children and adults for the indication of wasting (60-
62). Oxandrolone safely increased muscle mass in prepubertal boys with constitutional 
delay of growth (63). We propose a two-year clinical trial using two doses of oxandrolone 
versus placebo in young KS boys, ages 4 -12 years (see below).  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN  
Study Design: This study consists of a clinical trial composed of an eligible subset  of 
KS boys ages 4 -12 years.  The randomized design excludes bias in the assignment of 
patients to the treatment group and ensures optimal matching of the treatment group, 
which includes: 1. Oxandrolone (0.0 6 mg/kg PO, daily), or 2. oral placebo. The PI, 
patients, and research assistant will be blinded as to whether the oral medication is 
oxandrolone or placebo. The randomization is performed by [CONTACT_56636].  
Study Population: For the clinical trial,  KS boys ages 4 -12 years will be randomly 
assigne d to one of two treatment groups ( androgen versus no androgen) . We will recruit  
180 males (60 per year for 3 years) assuming an approximate 30% drop out rate, to 
accrue a total of 120 patients for the clinical trial substudy .  
Patient Recruitment: The PI h as the unique resource of a clinic at Thomas Jefferson 
University, where 60 KS boys are followed. All are untreated with any androgen.  We will also 
recruit additional patients by [CONTACT_211932].

I. Inclusion Criteria : 
1. Karyotype diagnosis of Klinefelter’s syndrome  or Klinefelter’s variant s, including 
48,XXYY and 48,XXXY  
2. Chronological ages [ADDRESS_253812] one year  
II. Exclusi on Criteria : 
1. Major liver, kidney or other systemic disease  
2. Dual diagnoses including pervasive developmental delay or autism.  
3. Variant k aryotypes including 46,XX males  and 47,XYY   
    males  
4. A high level of mosaicism (more than 50% 46,XY cells)  
III. Study Outcome:  
Physical features  
We will document visible phenotypic features using a digital photography system. 
Specific physical features examined and tests used are as follows:  
1.Anthropometric measurements  
1.  Measurements.  The clinical assessment  will include measurement of height, 
lower segment, and arm span. Subjects’ heights will be measured with a stadiometer . 
Measured or reported parental heights will also be recorded. Mid -parental height 
adjusted for the child’s sex (target height) will be c alculated using the formula 0.5 x 
[father's height (cm) + mother's height (cm) + 13] (64). Target height z -scores are 
calculated for subjects from sex -adjusted mid -parental height obtained from the National 
Center for Health Statistics growth curve data (65). Arm span will be measured as the 
distance from right to left 3rd finger tips with patients facing the wall, with outstretched 
arms held parallel to the ground. Lower segment will be measured from the top of the 
symphysis pubis to the floor.  Upper arm and lower leg circumferences will be measured.  
Results were converted to z -scores where possible using age - and gender -specific 
norms (65-67). 
2. Genitalia. We will measure penile length. Standards are available for penile 
growth in childhood and percentiles will be recorded (68). In addition, testicular size will 
be assessed with the Prader orchidometer and the measured volume will be recorded.  
3. Optional MRI SCAN: Patients with KS  will be asked if they would have an MRI 
scan done  at baseline and at or between the [ADDRESS_253813] able using conventional protocols.  This is usually associated 
with abnormal vascularity and localized functional abnormalities.  In addition, white 
matter integrity and brain circuitry may also be affected.  Therefore, the ability to assess 
oxygenation, p erfusion and functional connectivity and their changes under available

injections.  No sedation is invol ved. 
Laboratory studies  
1. Testicular function. Serum testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), 
luteinizing hormone (LH) , and salivary testosterone  levels will be measured. Testicular 
failure is defined by [CONTACT_211933].

yrs. old will be considered indeterminate if the gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_211925] 10 by [CONTACT_2054]. The 
presence of early testicular failure will be determined by [CONTACT_211934].  
2. Thyroid function. Free thyroxine (free T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
will be measured because of an increased risk for thyroid disorders in KS. Standard 
criteria of the Jefferson clinical laboratory  will be used to determine whether tests are 
abnormal.  
Radiographic studies

IV. Clinical trial substudy : Boys with Klinefelter’s syndrome will enter the study at ages 
4-[ADDRESS_253816] a 
full screening to  determine eligibility before randomization. They will be randomized 
(double -blind) to one of two treatment groups: oxandrolone 0.06 mg/kg/day , or placebo 
control for  two years.   All subjects will be evaluated for safety at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 
and 24 m onths, and after one and two years for end -point efficacy (cognitive and 
behavioral assessment).  
 The KS boys will be seen at 3-6-month intervals for the  two-year duration of the 
study. On each visit, boys will receive a careful history and physical examin ation to 
include assessment of Tanner staging (73) for pubic hair development (Tanner 1 = 
prepubertal -Tanner 5 = fully mat ure) and measurement of penile length and testicular 
volume. At baseline , three , and every  six months thereafter, we will measure height, 
weight, bone age (X -ray); fasting blood work to include complete blood count, serum 
glucose, liver function tests ( SGP T), lipid panel , thyroid studies,  testosterone, and free 
testosterone (the active form of testosterone) levels.  LH, FSH and estradiol will be 
measured yearly.  At baseline and after one year, each boy will undergo a battery of 
cognitive tests that will take  approximately 5 to 7 hours (see below).  
 The form of androgen will be the oral, nonaromatizable androgen oxandrolone. 
This androgen is FDA -approved for the indication of wasting and has been used safely 
for the past 30 years to stimulate growth in girls w ith Turner syndrome without virilization 
or major side effects. The dose , 0.06 mg/kg/day, was chosen because of the extensive 
previous experience with the dose of 0.06 mg/kg/day  used in girls with Turner syndrome.

Safety results necessitating an approximate 10-50% reduction in medication dose 
or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_56007]:  
1. Bone age advancement exceeding 12 months per 6 -month interval, with bone age 
exceeding chronologic age.  
2. Signs of early puberta l development for age, including pubic hair development in 
boys less than 8 years of age.  
3. Systolic blood pressure exceeding 95th %ile for age.  
4. Diastolic blood pressure exceeding 95th %ile for age.  
5. LDL cholesterol greater than159  mg/dl.  
6. HDL -C less than 20 mg/dl.  
7. SGPT  exceeding twice the upper limit of normal.  
8. Dose can be lowered at the discretion of the investigator for other reasons such as          
rapid growth.  
 
 The oxandrolone dosage cannot be reduced by [CONTACT_211935] 50% because of the 
nature of the oxandrolone tablets that come in a single strength, 2.5 mg. The 2.5 mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_211926] 1.25 mg dose. The 1.25 mg dose cannot 
be accurately split further. Thus, according the criteria listed above, we could re duce the 
3.75 mg dose to 2.5 mg and the 2.5 mg dose to 1.25 mg. Dose reduction will therefore 
range from approximately 10 -50%, depending on the weight of the child. If the dose 
needs to be reduced to less than 1.25 mg/day, we will change from daily to ever y other 
day dosing.  
 
 If at any visit the child’s weight is greater than the 95th percentile, the 95th 
percentile weight in kg will be used to calculate the dose. If this dose reduction is 
implemented, then additional reductions would not be implemented a t that visit for the 
other dose reduction criteria. At a single visit, if the dose of oxandrolone is reduced for 
one criterion, then the dosage is not reduced again for another study criterion.  
 
Safety results necessitating stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]:  
 If at any p oint in the study, two or more patients develop severe liver function 
changes or hypertension, the study will be stopped. These changes have not occurred 
with oxandrolone used in a trial with [ADDRESS_253818] Withdrawal from the study and adverse event reporting:  
Subjects can withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_92930] a

concerns about safety. Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing (blinded) basis by [CONTACT_978].  
 
Study compliance : We will assess patient compliance by [CONTACT_211936]: Androgen Effects on Cognition in Klinefelter’s Syndrome, Control # 02F476, Judith Ross, M.D.            
[ADDRESS_253819] -Study Visit:  Per the recommendation of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
all study participants will be invited back for a post -study visit. This visit will occur 
approximately 6-[ADDRESS_253820] -
study visit will include a history, physical examination, fasting blood work, bone age x -ray, 
photographs, and cognitive testing. Patients will be reimbursed $50.[ADDRESS_253821] 15 years. The analys es 
described below will include 2 groups of KS boys. All results will be based on gender and 
age-specific standardized scores. Analysis for safety will be performed at 3, 6, 12, 18, and  
24 months  and an efficacy analysis for summary scores encompassing all cognitive and 
behavioral variables will be performed at 12 and 24  months.  
I. Safety:  An analysis of safety parameters will be performed for the 3, 6, 12, [ADDRESS_253822] ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline values, comparing 
the active treatment group versus the placebo.  The safety parameters are:  systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, HDL, LDL cholesterol, liver function (ALT), bone age 
advancement, or signs of puberty (pu bic hair).  
II. Primary efficacy (Hypotheses 1 a,b,c):  The analysis comparing androgen -treated to 
placebo -treated KS subjects for the one and two-year measurements will be based on the 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). We will perform a two -way ANCOVA for the five primary 
outcome measures at 12 and 24 months, comparing  the treatment group versus the placebo , 
adjusting for baseline values and socioeconomic status.  There will be a total of 5 summary 
scores. Each score will be the sum of component  z -scores based on gender and age -specific 
normative values. The summary scores include 1. General cognition, 2. Language, 3. Working 
memory/executive function and attention, 4. Motor function, and 5. Self -image and behavior. 
The alpha level for statistical signific ance will be set at 0.01 for each of the five primary 
outcome results.  
Data Management and processing: [CONTACT_211938], the biostatistician, will perform all 
statistical analyses. All data will be entered using a custom program written for the project.  An 
on site data manager will oversee the data collection and entry, and quality control. The 
database will be visual dBase for data entry and will be converted to SAS (version 8.2) for 
statistical analyses. [CONTACT_211939] will produce the data source tables,  summary data tables as 
well as perform the designated analyses.  All entered data will be manually compared to the 
source documents for accuracy. Additional checks for consistency within and between 
records will be built into source documents for accuracy . Baseline and follow -up data will be 
collected on case report forms.

SYNOPSIS  
 
Title: The AUDYT trial: An open -label Study to Define the Safety, Tolerability and Clinical Activity of 
deutetrabenazine ( AUstedo)  in Adult Study subjects  with DYsTonia  
Investigator: Deik, Andres F  
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , [LOCATION_002]  
 
Background / Rationale  
A number of studies have demonstrated Tetrabenazine (TBZ) is effective in the symptomatic treatment of 
dystonia. Tetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor that modulates synaptic 
dopamine. Unfortunately, the use of TBZ is often  limited by [CONTACT_599890], which includes, but is not 
limited to, depression (including suicidal depression), sedation and parkinsonism. Deutetrabenazine  
(AUSTEDOTM) is a novel, highly selective VMAT2 inhibitor that contains deuterium, a stable isotope of 
hydrogen. Deuterium attenuates the metabolism of AUSTEDO , leading to reduced fluctuations in plasmatic 
levels as compared to TBZ. This, is turn, reduces adverse events associated to peak drug concentrations. 
AUSTEDO  is approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for the treatment of chorea associated 
with Huntington ’s disease (HD)  and Tardive Dyskinesias  in adults, but not for the treatment of dystonia. 
Given its shared mechanism of action with TBZ, an opportunity exists to establish the safety, tolerability and 
clinical activity of AUSTEDO  in subjects  with dystonia.  
 
Primary Study Objective  
To explore the safety and tolerability of the daily oral administration of AUSTEDO  in adult study subjects  
with dystonia.  
 
Secondary Study Objective s 
1. To establish the degree of symptomatic effect of AUSTEDO  as measured by [CONTACT_599891]  (CGI -I) after [ADDRESS_794338] of AUSTEDO  as measured by [CONTACT_599892]  (PGI -I) after [ADDRESS_794339] 
tolerated dose.  
 
Design  
This is a single -center, open -label study of AUSTEDO  in study subjects  with dystonia. The study will provide 
preliminary experience of the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of AUSTEDO  in study subjects  with 
dystonia. Study duration will be up to 13 weeks from screening ( Visit  1) to the post treatment evaluation 
(Visit  5). Treatment period from drug initiation to final on -treatment Visit  will be 12 weeks, or less, as 
follows: during the ramp -up period , study drug will start at 12 mg/day (6 mg twice  daily) and will be titrated 
weekly by 6 mg/day increments until  either  1) the maximal allowable dose (48 mg/day) is reached, or 2) 
dose -limiting side -effects occur. In study subjects  receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, the maximum allowed 
dose of AUSTEDO  will be 36 mg/day, reducing study duration (due to a reduction in the ramp -up period) to 
11 weeks. Study subjects  who experience dose -limiting side effects will be maintained on their maximum 
tolerated dose. Once the maximal dose is established for each participant, they will complete 6 continuous 
weeks on this dose ( maintenance period ), followed by a 1 -week washout. For study subjects  unable to 
titrate up to 48 mg/day due to side effects, the 6 weeks of maintenance will start once they reduce the 
study drug back to the maximum well -tolerated dose. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the 
5 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  study and will be reported after drug initiation. Dose reductions, suspensions, and withdrawals due to 
adverse events will be recorded. ECG readings will be measured at screening, during week 2, during the first 
week of the maintenance period  (whenever this is established to be, typi[INVESTIGATOR_282576] 7 for subjects  able to 
titrate up to 48 mg/day), immediately before washout (week 12 for those study subjects  who are able to 
titrate up to 48 mg/day) and during week 13. Assessment of Columbia Suicide Severity Rating  Scale  and 
Stanford  Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_599874] s. The Mini Mental (MMSE) Scale  
will be performed at screening and at the final on -treatment Visit  (week 12). A video examination of the 
study subjects  will be made at screening (right before initiation of the study drug), and after 6 weeks on 
AUSTEDO  at a steady dose (right before drug cessation). Part III of the MDS -UPDRS  will be performed at 
both of these Visit s as well to screen for the appearance of drug -induced par kinsonism. Videos will be sent 
to raters blinded to treatment, Visit  number and recording date.

1. INTRODUCTION   
1.1 Overview of d ystonia  and its treatments  
 
Dystonia is defined as a movement disorder characterized by [CONTACT_599894], often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Dystonic movements 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_599875], and may be tremulous. Dystonia is often initiated or  worsened by 
[CONTACT_599895]. Dystonia is classified along two axes: 
clinical characteristics, including age at onset, body distribution, temporal pattern and associated 
features (additional movement disorder s or neurological features); and etiology, which includes nervous 
system pathology and inheritance. The clinical characteristics fall into several specific dystonia 
syndromes that help to guide diagnosis and treatment.[ADDRESS_794345] to large -Scale, double -blinded, placebo -controlled trials, and there is no 
FDA-approved oral medication for treatment of dystonia. Much of the evidence supporting their  use 
comes from small controlled trials, non -blinded trials, retrospective reviews, and anecdotal experience.2 
 
Different classes of medications are often used to treat dystonia.2 These include:  
• Anticholinergics :  These drugs are thought to work by [CONTACT_599896].  Examples include trihexyphenidyl, benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], biperidin, 
ethopropazine, orphenadrine and procyclidine . 
• Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] : Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_599876].  Commonly 
used benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_599877], chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, and diazepam.   
• Dopaminergics: Augmenting dopamine transmission with levodopa is dramatically effective in 
dopa -responsive dystonia, which is most often caused by [CONTACT_599897]1  gene encoding 
the enzyme GTP -cyclohydrolase.  
• Dopamine depleters: T etrabenazine , a reversible  vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) 
inhibitor for oral administration , may be useful for some subjects with dystonia, particularly 
those with tardive dystonia.    
1.2 Background   
1.2.1  Overview on AUSTEDO  
 
As described in the drug’s package insert,3 deutetrabenazine  (which will be referred to by [CONTACT_599898] 
“AUSTEDO” in this protocol ) is a  novel VMAT2 inhibitor for oral administration.  It is believed to deplet e 
monoamines (such as dopamine, serotonin, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and histamine) from nerve terminals.  It is 
closely related to Tetrabenazine (TBZ), which has been approved for the treatment of Huntington’s 
disease chorea. However, its high affinity for VMAT2 makes AUSTEDO better tolerated than TBZ. 
AUSTEDO has been FDA approved for the treatment of Huntin gton’s disease chorea and, more recently,  
12 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  for the treatment of Tardive Dyskinesias (TD). AUSTEDO has not been studied yet for the treatment of 
dystonia.   
1.2.2  Clinical studies with AUSTEDO  
 
Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study – Chorea associated with HD  
The efficacy of AUSTEDO  as a treatment for chorea associated with Huntington's disease was 
established primarily in Study 1, a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center trial 
conducted in [ADDRESS_794346] chorea associated with Huntington’s disease. The 
diagnosis of Huntington’s disease was based on family history, neurological exam, and genetic testing. 
Treatment duration was [ADDRESS_794347], at weekly intervals, in 6 mg increments until satisfactory 
treatment of chorea was achieved, intolerable side effects occurred, or until a maximal dose of 48 mg 
per day was reached. The primary efficacy end point was the Total Maximal Chorea Score, an item of the 
Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale  (UHDRS). On this Scale , chorea is rated from 0 to 4 (with 0 
representing no chorea) for 7 different parts o f the body. The total score ranges from 0 to 28. Of the 90 
subjects  enrolled, 87 subjects  completed the study. The mean age was 54 (range 23 to 74). Subjects  
were 56% male and 92% Caucasian. The mean dose after titration was 40 mg per day. Total Maximal 
Chorea Scores for subjects  receiving AUSTEDO  improved by [CONTACT_3450] 4.4 units from baseline to the 
maintenance period (average of Week 9 and Week 12), compared to approximately 1.[ADDRESS_794348] ically significant (p<0.0001). The 
Maintenance Endpoint is the mean of the Total Maximal Chorea Scores for the Week 9 and Week 12 
Visit s. At the Week 13 follow -up Visit  (1 week after discontinuation of the study medication), the Total 
Maximal Chorea Scores of subjects  who had received AUSTEDO  returned to baseline . A patient -rated 
global impression of change assessed how subjects  rated their overall Huntington’s disease symptoms. 
Fifty -one percent of subjects  treated with AUSTEDO  rated their symptoms as “Muc h Improved” or “Very 
Much Improved” at the end of treatment, compared to 20% of placebo -treated subjects . In a physician -
rated clinical global impression of change, 42% percent of subjects  treated with AUSTEDO  rated their 
symptoms as “Much Improved” or “Very Much Improved” at the end of treatment compared to 13% of 
placebo -treated subjects .3 
 
Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study – Tardive dyskinesia  
Double -blind, randomized, placebo -contr olled, phase 3 trial at 75 cent ers in the [LOCATION_003] and Europe. 
Subjects  aged 18 -80 years with tardive dyskinesia (≥3 months before screening) were randomly assigned 
centrally (1:1:1:1), via interactive response technology, to receive one of three fixed doses of AUSTEDO  
(12 mg/day, 24 mg/day, or 36 mg/day) or matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_599899]. Subjects  were started on oral AUSTEDO  12 mg/day, and this dose 
was incre ased through week 4 until the randomized dose was achieved, then maintained over 8 weeks. 
During the treatment period, subjects , investigators, their site personnel, and sponsor were masked to 
group assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale  
(AIMS) score from baseline to week [ADDRESS_794349] -baseline rating. The primary 
efficacy analysis was done in the modified intention -to-treat population (baseline AIMS score ≥[ADDRESS_794350] -baseline rating). The safety analysis was done in subjects  who received any study drug.  
AUSTEDO  24 mg/day and 36 mg/day provided a significant reduction in tardive dyskinesia, with 
favorable safety and tolerability. These findings suggest that dosing regimens could be individualized 
and tailored for subjects  on the basis of dyskinesia control and tolerability.4 
 
Double -Blind  Study – Tardive dyskinesia   
13 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  One hundred seventeen subjects  with moderate to severe TD received AUSTEDO  or placebo in this 
randomized, double -blind, multicenter trial. Eligibility criteria included an Abnormal Involuntary 
Movement Scale  (AIMS) score of ≥6 assessed by [CONTACT_380163], stable psychiatric illness, 
and stable psychoactive medication treatment. Primary endpoint was the change in AIMS score from 
baseline to week 12. Secondary endpoints included treatment success a t week 12 on the Clinical Global 
Impression of Change (CGIC) and Patient Global Impression of Change.  For the primary endpo int, 
AUSTEDO  significantly reduced AIMS scores from baseline to week 12 vs. placebo (least -squares mean 
[standard error] -3.0 [0.45] vs. -1.6 [0.46], p = 0.019). Treatment success on CGIC (48.2% vs. 40.4%) 
favored AUSTEDO  but was not significant. AUSTEDO  and placebo groups showed low rates of psychiatric 
adverse events: anxiety (3.4% vs. 6.8%), depressed mood/depression (1.7% vs. 1.7%), and suicidal 
ideation (0% vs. 1.7%, respectively). In addition, no worsening in parkinsonism, as measured by [CONTACT_599900] P arkinson's Disease Rating Scale  motor subscale , was noted from baseline to week 12 in either 
group.5 
 
Open label Study – Tardive dyskinesia  
In this open -label study of 12 -18-year -old subjects  with TS -related tics, AUSTEDO  was titrated up to 36 
mg/day over 6 weeks to adequately suppress tics without bothersome adverse effects (AEs), followed by 
[CONTACT_599901] 2 weeks. An independent blinded rater assessed tic severity using the 
Yale Global Tic Severity Scale  (YGTSS), which was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome 
measures included the TS Clinical Global Impression (TS -CGI) and TS Patient Global Impression of Change 
(TS-PGIC).  Twenty -three enrolled subjects  received AUSTEDO  and had at least [ADDRESS_794351] -baseline YGTSS 
assessment. The mean (SD [standard deviation]) baseline YGTSS Total Tic Severity Score (TTS) was 31.6 
(7.9) and had decreased by 11.6 (8.2) points at week 8, a 37.6% reduction in tic severity (p<0.0001). The 
TS-CGI s core improved by 1.2 (0.81) points (p<0.0001) and the TS -PGIC results at week 8 indicated that 
76% of subjects  were much improved or very much improved compared with baseline. The mean (SD) 
daily AUSTEDO  dose at week 8 was 32.1 (6.6) mg (range 18 -36 mg). One week after withdrawal of 
AUSTEDO , the TTS scores increased by 5.6 (8.4) points, providing confirmation of the drug effect. No 
serious or severe adverse events were reported.[ADDRESS_794352] demonstrated Tetrabenazine (TBZ) is 
effective in the symptomatic treatment of dystonia.7-14 Tetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine 
transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor that modulates synaptic dopamine.[ADDRESS_794353] profile, which includes, 
but is not limited to, depression (including suicidal depression), sedation and parkinsonism. AUSTEDO  is 
a novel, highly selective VMAT2 inhibitor that contains deuterium, a stable isotope of hydrogen. 
Deuterium attenuates the metabolism of AUSTEDO , leading to reduced fluctuations in plasmatic lev els 
as compared to TBZ. This, in  turn, reduces adverse events associated to peak drug concentrations.16 
AUSTEDO  is approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for the treatment of chorea 
associated with Huntington ’s disease (HD)  and Tardive Dyskinesias  in adults, but not for the treatment 
of dystonia. Given its share d mechanism of action with TBZ, and its more favorable safety profile, an 
opportunity exists to establish the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of AUSTEDO  in subjects  with 
dystonia.    
1.3.1  Selection of AUSTEDO  Dose and Schedule of Administration  
  
14 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  AUSTEDO is available in 6, 9 and 12 mg tablets. To allow a precise dose titration among study subjects, 
only 6 mg tablets will be used in the AUDYT trial. As this is an open label trial, all subjects will receive the 
study drug; there is no placebo arm. Al l subjects will be instructed to take AUSTEDO with food, and not 
to chew, crush or break the tablets. The trial will consist of 3 periods:  
 
1. Ramp -up period: During this titration period, AUSTEDO  will be started at 12 mg/day and 
increased up to 48 mg/day for most study subjects, up to 36 mg/day for study subjects receiving 
a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, or up to the maximum, well -tolerate d dose for those subjects unable 
to tolerate the maximum recommended dose  of AUSTEDO . Dose -limiting toxicity will be defined 
in this protocol as the development of any of the following during the titration period: a) new or 
worsening depression, b) worsening of dysto nic symptoms, c) QTc increase of >39 but <60  
milliseconds from baseline, or d) any other sign or symptom that, at the PI's discretion, would 
preclude further safe titration of the study drug.  AUSTEDO  will be increased  by 6 mg/week as 
recommended in the package insert,3 as shown in Table  2 below:

Week 3  24 
Week 4  30 
Week 5  36 
Week 6  42 
Week 7  48 
 
2. Maintenance period: Once on the maximum dose, subjects will complete 6 weeks of treatment 
on that dose, unless a side effects ensues. If so, it will remain at the investigator’s discretion 
whether to discontinue the study drug, or to reduce the dose to a new, maximum, well -
tolerated dose, on which the study subject will complete [ADDRESS_794354] treatment period: Following [ADDRESS_794355] of AUSTEDO  as measured by [CONTACT_599902]  (CGI -I) after [ADDRESS_794356] tolerated dose.

Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  2. To establish the degree of symptomatic effect of AUSTEDO  as measured by [CONTACT_599903] (PGI -I) after [ADDRESS_794357] tolerated dose.   
2.3 Safety Outcome Assessments  
 
The following assessments will establish the safety and tolerability of AUSTEDO during the AUDYT trial:  
 
• Tolerability will be established by [CONTACT_599904] 48 mg/d 
(or up to 36 mg/d if receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor) and able to complete the study at this 
dosage.  
• Adverse events will be surveyed during all study Visits  and during weekly telephone 
communications with the study subjects that will happen during the ramp -up period.  
• AUSTEDO  may prolong the QT interval. QT interval prolongation is associated with the 
development of tachyarrhythmias and Torsades de Pointes. To screen for the development of 
significant QT prolongation (defined as a corrected QT –Bazett – interval of  450 (458) 
milliseconds  –or higher – in men or 460 (472) milliseconds  –or higher – in women), a  12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed during  all scheduled study Visit s, including the early 
termination Visit , if such a Visit happens.  Should there be evidence o f QT prolongation, it will 
remain at the investigator’s discretion  whether to discontinue the study drug, or to reduce the 
dose to a new, maximum, well -tolerated dose.  A follow up ECG will be performed 1 week after 
the dose reduction (during an unscheduled Visit) to ensure the QTc is no longer significantly 
prolonged.   
• A complete p hysical examination will be performed at the time of the initial and final study Visit, 
as well as during the early termination Visit, if applicable. Any and all changes in the 
examination happening during the trial will be recorded, and reported when appropriate.  
• Vital Signs (including weight) will be measured and recorded during  all scheduled study Visit s, 
including the early termination Visit , if such a Visit happens. Any and all gross abnormalities or 
significant changes will be reported.  
• Suicidal thoughts or actions are a possible side effect of AUSTEDO use. The Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS) will be administered during  all scheduled study Visit s, including 
the early termination Visit , if such a Visit happens. Development of suicidality as determined by 
[CONTACT_599905], as well as psychiatric care as determined necessary by [CONTACT_093]. Subjec ts 
with any signs or suicidality duri ng Visit 1 as detected by [CONTACT_599906].  
• Somnolence is a possible side effect of AUSTEDO use. The Stanford Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS)  will be 
administered during  all scheduled study Visit s, including the early termination Visit , if such a 
Visit happens. Should this side effect develop, the investigator will decided whether to continue 
AUSTEDO at the current dose, to discontinue the study drug, or to reduce the dose to a new, 
maximum, well -tolerated dose .  
• To assess the impact AUSTEDO may have on cognitive function, if any, the Mini Mental State 
Examination  (MMSE)  will be administered during Visits 1, 4 and during  the early termination 
Visit , if such a Visit happens. It will remain at the investigator’s discretion to either discontinue 
the study drug, or to reduce the dose to a new, maximum, well -tolerated dose  if clinically - 
16 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  significant, new -onset cognitive impairment is identified at any point during the course of the 
trial, even if detected during Visits during which the MMSE  is not administered.  
• To screen for the development of drug -induced parkinsonism, a possible side effect of AUSTEDO 
use, the MDS -UPDRS (Part III) will be administered during Visits 1, 4 and during  the early 
termination Visit , if such a Visit happens. It will remain at the investigator’s discretion to either 
discontinue the study drug, or to reduce the dose to a new, maximum, well -tolerated dose  if 
clinically -significant, new -onset drug -induced parkinsonism is identified at any point during the 
course of the trial, even if detect ed during Visits during which the MDS -UPDRS (Part III) is not 
administered.   
2.4 Efficacy Outcome Assessments  
 
Although the AUDYT trial is not powered to accurately establish efficacy of AUSTEDO, the following 
assessments will be performed:  
 
• Patient Global Impression of Improvement : During Visit 4, subjects will be asked to rate the 
change in their dystonic symptoms using this Scale.   
• Clinical Global Impression of Improvement  Scale : A video will be made of each subject’s 
movement disorder examination during Visit s 1 and 4. Videos will be sent to raters blinded to 
Visit  number and recording date.  Raters will be asked to compare the videos looking for any 
change in the subjects’ dystonic symptoms. Their impressions will be recorded using this Scale.  
• Global Dystonia Rating Scale: Blinded video raters will also be asked to rate the severity of the 
subjects’ dystonia in all videos using this Scale.  
 
 
   
  
 
3. STUDY METHODS   
3.1 Study Design  
 
This is a single -center, open -label study of AUSTEDO  in study subjects  with dystonia. The study will 
provide preliminary experience of the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of AUSTEDO  in study 
subjects  with dystonia. Study duration will be up to 13 weeks from screening ( Visit  1) to the post 
treatment evaluation (Visit 5 ) for study subjects able to titrate up to 48 mg/day . Treatment period from 
drug initiation to final on -treatment Visit  will be 12 weeks, or less, as follows: during the ramp -up 
period , study drug will start at 12 mg/day (6 mg twice daily) and will be  titrated weekly by 6 mg/day 
increments until either 1) the maximal allowable dose (48 mg/day) is reached, or 2) dose -limiting side -
effects occur.  Dose -limiting toxicity will be defined in this protocol as the development of any of the 
following during the titration period: a) new or worsening depression, b) worsening of dystonic 
symptoms, c) QTc increase of >39 but <60 m illiseconds  from baseline, or d) any other sign or symptom 
that, at the PI's discretion, would preclude further safe titration of the study drug.  In study subjects  
receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, the maximum allowed dose of AUSTEDO  will be 36 mg/day, 
reducing study duration to 11 weeks  (given a shortening in the ramp -up period) . Study subjects  who 
experience dose -limiting side  effects will be maintained on their maximum tolerated dose. Once the 
maximal dose is established for each participant, they will complete 6 continuous weeks on this dose 
(maintenance period ), followed by a 1 -week washout. For study subjects  unable to titrate up to 48 
mg/day due to side effects, the 6 weeks of maintenance will start once they reduce the study drug to 
the maximum dose they can tolerate well .   
17 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021   
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study and will be reported after drug initiation. Dose 
reductions, suspensions, and withdrawals due to adverse events will be recorded. ECG readings , the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  and the Stanford  Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_599878] . The Mini Mental (MMSE) Scale  will be performed at screening and at the final 
on-treatment Visit  (Visit 4, usually during week 12). A video examination of the study subjects  will be 
made at screening (right before initiation of the study drug), and after 6 weeks on AUSTEDO  at a steady 
dose (right before drug cessation). Part III of the MDS -UPDRS will be performed at both of these Visit s as 
well to screen for the appearance of drug -induced parkinsonism. Videos will be sent to raters blinded to 
Visit  number and recording date , who will assess changes in the subjects’ dystonic symptoms . Patients 
will be contact[CONTACT_8644] a weekly basis via telephone during the ramp -up.  
3.2 Site  
 
The AUDYT trial will be a single -center trial to be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania’s 
Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Center. This Center has ample experience in conducting 
clinical trials, and has the necessary infrastructure and qu alified research staff to do so.    
3.3 Number of Subjects  
 
Given this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], single -center, open -label trial, a  number of 15 study subjects  was sel ected to 
guarantee recruitment (it is expected that 2 subjects will be recruited/month).    
3.[ADDRESS_794358] 11 weeks prior to screening (Visit 1). Subjects receiving injections sooner than every 12 weeks will 
be eligible to participate in the study as long as their upcoming injections are scheduled 6 days, or less, 
from the time of screening. It wil l be allowed for study subjects to undergo Visit 1 on the same day as 
their regularly -scheduled botulinum toxin injections, as long as Visit 1 (in its entirety) happens BEFORE 
the injections.  
 
Subjects who have undergone Deep Brain Stimulation surgery for the treatment of dystonia will be 
eligible to participate in the study if their stimulation settings have remained unchanged for at least [ADDRESS_794359].    
3.4.1  Inclusion Criteria

(ICF) is signed and with the capacity to provide voluntary informed consent.  
3. Study subjects able to read and understand English and the ICF and are willing to comply with all 
study procedures, treatment and follow -up.   
18 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  4. Study subjects who are taking any central nervous system acting medications (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
antidepressants, hypnotics), including medications for the treatment of dystonia, will be  on a stable 
regimen for at least 30 days prior to the screening Visit , and will willing to remain on the same dose 
for the duration of the study.  
5. Female of child -bearing potential will not be pregnant and will be  using an acceptable method of 
contraception.  
6. Study subjects with an MMSE >24.   
3.4.2  Exclusion Criteria  
 
1. Exposure to dopamine blockers prior to the onset of dystonia that could, in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], have caused dystonia .  
2. Study subjects with genetically -confirmed dopa -responsive dystonia.  
3. Study subjects with a diagnosis of Parkinson’s or an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_427275].  
4. Study subjects with a history of bipolar disorder or major depression, or the presence of active 
depression.  
5. Study subjects with a history of a suicide attempt or suicidal ideations , as well as the presence of 
active suicidal ideation as detailed on the C -SSRS administered during Visit 1 .  
6. Study subjects with a history of schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders.  
7. Treatment with tetrabenazine, reserpi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  valbenazine, a monoamino oxidase inhibitor,  a-methyl -p-
tyrosine, strong anticholinergic medications, metoclopramide, antipsychotics,  dopamine agonists, 
levodopa, and/or stimulants within 30 days of screening . 
8. Treatment with botulinum toxin less than 11 weeks prior to screening (Visit 1); subjects receiving 
injections sooner than every 12 weeks will be excluded if their next injection is scheduled farther 
than 6 days from screening.  
9. Presence of a neurologic condition that could confound dystonia assessments.  
10. Study subjects with a history of clinically relevant hepatic disease.  
11. Study subjects with a history of renal insufficiency.

13. A corrected QT (Bazett) interval of 450 (458) milliseconds in men or 460 (472) milliseconds in 
women on [ADDRESS_794360] Participation  
 
The duration of study participation will be 13 weeks from screening (Week 1) to the post treatment 
evaluation (Week 13). Treatment period from drug initiation to final on -treatment Visit  will be 12 weeks, 
or less, as follows:  
 
• Study subjects able to titrate up to 48 mg/day will have 6 weeks of ramp -up and 6 weeks of 
maintenance.  
• Study subjects  receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor  will only be allowed to titrate AUSTEDO up to 
a dose of 36 mg/day. They will have will have [ADDRESS_794361] treatment evaluati on is included.  
• Study subjects who experience dose -limiting side effects will be maintained on their maximum 
tolerated dose. Once the maximal dose is established for a study subject , they will complete 6  
19 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  continuous weeks on this dose (maintenance period), followed by a 1 -week washout. For these 
study subjects, the 6 weeks of maintenance will start once they reduce the study drug to the 
maximum well -tolerated dose , independent of the duration of the ramp -up period . 
• The duration of the trial for s tudy subjects who experience dose -limiting side effects  that arise 
during the ramp -up period  will depend on the dose at which the side effects appear. For these 
subjects, maintenance will continue to last [ADDRESS_794362] a 1 week washout.  
• Premature, unexpected withdrawal from the trial will shorten study duration for that subject in 
unpredictable ways; subjects will be asked to undergo an early termination safety Visit, 
whenever possible.   
3.4.[ADDRESS_794363] a maximal duration of 13 weeks/subject, 
which includes a [ADDRESS_794364] (recruited during month 8) participates in the study for 13 
weeks (the longest possible study duration per subject), this would bring complete study duratio n from 
the time of recruitment of the first study subject (Visit 1) to Visit [ADDRESS_794365] to about 11 
months.    
3.5 Study Visit  and Assessment Schedule   
3.5.1  Schedule for subjects able to increase to and maintain maximum AUSTEDO dose  
 
A diagram summarizing all study visits can be found in the Appendix section (Appendix 1). Details on 
each of the individual study visits are depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393].    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Visit 1: Screening  (Week 1)  
 
This will be the first study Visit. During this Visit, subjects will sign the informed consent form, their 
eligibility for study participation will be confirmed, and study drug will be dispensed. Demographic and 
baseline characteristics (age at screening, gender, weight, height, BMI, race, ethnicity, medical history, 
physical examination) will be listed for individual subjects.  The activities to be performed during Visit 1 
include:  
 
• Informed consent  
• Medical history will be obtained  
• Medication history will be obtained. All prior medications will be assigned a generic name [CONTACT_599925] (WHO) Dictionary .  
• Concomitant medications will be reviewed (subjects receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor  will be 
instructed to titrate up to 36 mg during the ramp -up period, not to 48 mg, once study drug is 
dispensed). All concomitant medications will be assigned a generic name [CONTACT_599926] (WHO) Dictionary . When applicable, date of last and next botulinum toxin 
injections will be recorded, as well as the date of the last DBS setting changes.  
• Complete physical exam  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead ECG  
• C-SSRS  
• SSS 
• MMSE  
• First video of the movement disorder examination   
20 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  • MDS -UPDRS Part III  
• Revision of eligibility criteria (inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed)  
• Dispense study drug (if eligible for participation)   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Visit 2: Ramp -up period (Week 2 +/ - 2 Days)  
 
Visit [ADDRESS_794366] one on study drug. This is a safety Visit, which will happen 5 -9 days after study 
drug initiation. The activities to be performed during Visit 2 include:  
 
• Adverse events will be assessed  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead ECG  
• C-SSRS  
• SSS 
 
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_8644] a weekly basis via telephone during the ramp -up period to assess study 
drug tolerability. Dose reductions will be allowed in this period at the discretion of the investigator, but 
also during the maintenance period. A dose red uction during the ramp -up period will determine the 
start of the maintenance period, as it will be assumed that the new, lower AUSTEDO dose is the 
maximum well -tolerated dose of AUSTEDO for that study subject. Similarly, subjects will remain on the 
new, ma ximum well -tolerated dose of AUSTEDO for the remainder of the trial once a dose reduction is 
done during the maintenance period.  
   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Visit 3: Maintenance dose starts  
 
This is a safety Visit. The time during which this Visit will happen may vary depending on the duration of 
the ramp -up period, as follows:  
 
• For subjects able to titrate up to 48 mg/day, Visit 3 will be scheduled during week 7.  
• For subjects receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor and, hence, able to titrate only up to 36 
mg/day, Visit 3 will happen during week 5.  
• For subjects with dose -limiting side effects during the ramp -up period, Visit 3 will be scheduled 
up to 3 days after the maximal, well -tolerated dose is established (this landmark will determine 
when the maintenance period has started).  
 
 The activities to be performed during Visit 3 include:  
 
• Adverse events will be assessed  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead ECG  
• C-SSRS  
• SSS

21 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  subjects will be instructed on when to stop AUSTEDO. According to the package insert,3 treatment with 
AUSTEDO  can be discontinued without tapering.  The activities to be performed during Visit 4 include:  
 
• Adverse events will be assessed  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead ECG  
• C-SSRS  
• SSS 
• MMSE  
• Second video of the movement disorder examination  
• MDS -UPDRS Part III  
• Patient Global Impression of Improvement   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Visit 5: Post treatment evaluation  
 
Visit 5 will be scheduled 1 week (or up to 9 days, if necessary) after study drug cessation. This is a safety 
Visit. The activities to be performed during Visit 5 include:  
 
• Adverse events will be assessed  
• Complete physical exam  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead ECG  
• C-SSRS  
• SSS 
• Returned bottles will be collected and compliance will be assessed    
3.5.2  Special situations that could cause changes in Study Visit Schedule   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Shortened Ramp -up Period  
 
There are three scenarios that could shorten the duration of the ramp -up period:  
 
1. Study subjects taking a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor : The maximum dose of AUSTEDO allowed for 
subjects taking a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor  will be 36 mg/day. These study subjects will start 
AUSTEDO at 12 mg/day and increase  at weekly intervals in increments of 6 mg per day  up to 36 
mg/day, if tolerated, as instructed in the package insert.3 For these subjects, the maximum 
length of the ramp -up period will be 4 weeks.  
2. Subjects unable to titrate up to the maximum recommended dose: Whether it is 48 mg/day or 
36 mg/day, study subjects may experience dose -limiting side effects that do not allow them to 
titrate up to their individual, maximal recommended dose. Any side effec ts encountered during 
the ramp -up period will be recorded and reported as appropriate. Study subjects who encounter 
these side effects will be instructed to reduce the total daily AUSTEDO dose by 6 mg (1 tablet) 
every day until a new, maximum well -tolerate d dose of AUSTEDO is established. A faster dose 
reduction will be allowed if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. Once this new dose is 
determined, the maintenance period will be considered initiated and subjects will be asked to 
complete Visit 3 at the s tudy site within 3 days.  
3. Subjects unable to tolerate 12 mg/day of AUSTEDO: Subjects who are unable to tolerate the 
starting dose of the study drug will be withdrawn from the trial. Side effects encountered will be 
recorded and reported as appropriate.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Early Termination   
22 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021   
If at any time during the study a patient requests to withdraw from treatment, or if a decision is made to 
withdraw the patient from the study , the patient will be requested to return for an Early Termination 
Visit .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unscheduled Visit  
 
A patient may return for an unscheduled Visit at any time at the Investigator’s discretion  (for example, 
when a one week post dose -reduction ECG is required) . The procedures conducted at the unscheduled 
Visit  may be limited, depending on the reason for the Visit  (for example, for dispensing of new study 
drug to replace a lost bottle of study drug would only require those specific procedures relevant to the 
reason for the unscheduled Visit  to be done).    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Adjustment  
 
Adjustments in the dose of AUSTEDO will be allowed throughout the study. If a reduction in the dose of 
AUSTEDO is required during the ramp -up period due to dose -limiting side effects, study subjects will be 
instructed to reduce the total daily AUSTEDO dose  by 6 mg (1 tablet) every day until a new, maximum 
well-tolerated dose of AUSTEDO is established. A faster dose reduction will be allowed if deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_093]. Once this new dose is determined, the maintenance period will be 
considered i nitiated, and subjects will be instructed to complete Visit 3 and to remain on this dose for 6 
weeks. Any side effects encountered will be recorded and reported as appropriate.  
 
Dose -limiting toxicity will be defined in this protocol as the development of any of the following during 
the titration period: a) new or worsening depression, b) worsening of dystonic symptoms, c) QTc 
increase of >39 but <60  milliseconds from baseline, or d) any other sign or symptom that, at the PI's 
discretion, would preclude further safe titration of the study drug.  
 
If a reduction in the dose of AUSTEDO is required during the maintenance period due to dose -limiting 
side effects, study subjects will be instructed to reduce the total daily AUSTEDO dose by 6 mg (1 tablet) 
every day until a new, maximum well -tolerated dos e of AUSTEDO is established. A faster dose reduction 
will be allowed if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. Once this new dose is determined, subjects will 
be instructed to remain on this dose until the 6 weeks of the maintenance period are completed. A new 
maintenance period will NOT start every time a dose reduction is performed. Any side effects 
encountered will be recorded and reported as appropriate.  
 
Increments in the total daily dose of AUSTEDO will not exceed 6 mg/week, as recommended by [CONTACT_599907].[ADDRESS_794369] has 
been off study drug for 6 days or less. S ubjects  who require drug cessation for a week or more will be 
consider withdrawn from the trial , and will be asked to complete an early termination Visit .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject Withdrawal  
 
Subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Reasons that subjects 
may be withdrawn from the study include the following:  
 
• Subject discontinued study medication: according to the package insert,3 following treatment 
interruption of greater than one week, AUSTEDO  therapy would  need to be re -titrated when 
resumed, and, thus, subjects  who require drug cessation for a week or more will be consider ed  
23 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  withdrawn from the trial. For treatment interruption of less than one week, treatment can be 
resumed at the previous maintenance dose without titration , as per the package insert .3 
• Subject consent is withdrawn  
• QTc changes: A study subject will be asked to discontinue study drug if at any point during the 
trial he or she is found on ECG to have developed a QTc> 500  milliseconds or a QTc increase of 
>60 milliseconds from baseline.  
• Sponsor decision, after d iscussion with the Investigator  
 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study, all efforts will be made to complete the early termination Visit  
that includes efficacy assessments and safety follow -up. In addition, women of childbearing potential 
will have a pregnancy test performed at the early termination Visit . All information, including the reason 
for withdrawal, will be  reported. For subjects who are lost to follow -up, three recorded  attempts will be 
made to contact [CONTACT_139004] -up information, including reason for discontinuatio n and follow -
up of AEs. Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.   
3.6 Study Procedures and Assessments   
3.6.1  Safety assessments   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events   
 
During the study, the Investigator or study site personnel will be responsible for querying and recording 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). In this study AEs and SAEs will be reported from 
the time of study drug administration until Visit  [ADDRESS_794370].  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in conjunction with the use of a 
medicinal product in humans, whether or not considered to have a causal relatio nship to the medicinal 
product. According to the package insert,[ADDRESS_794371] 4% of subjects on 
AUSTEDO and with a greater incidence than on placebo include somnolence, diarrhea, dry mouth, 
fatigue, urinary tract infection, insomnia, anxiety, constipation and contusion.   
 
All AEs will be recorded regardless of the severity or relationship to study medication. All AEs that result 
in permanent discontinuation of the study drug being studied, whether serious or nonserious, will be 
reported. Figure 1 below shows the form that will capture this data.

[IP_ADDRESS]  ECG  
 
AUSTEDO  may prolong the QT interval. QT interval prolongation is associated with the development of 
tachyarrhythmias and Torsades de Pointes. To screen for the development of significant QT  
25 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  prolongation (defined as a corrected QT –Bazett – interval of 450 (458) milliseconds in men or 460 (472) 
milliseconds in women), a 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed during all scheduled study 
Visit s, including the early termination Visit , if such a Visit  happens. Should there be evidence of QT 
prolongation , it will remain at the investigator’s discretion  to either discontinue the study drug, or to 
reduce the dose to a new, maximum, well -tolerated dose. A follow up ECG will be performed 1 week 
after the dose reduction (during an unscheduled Visit ) to ensure  the QT prolongation is no longer 
significant.  
 
However, a  study subject will be asked to discontinue study drug if at any point during the trial he or she 
is found on ECG to have developed a QTc> 500 m illiseconds  or a QTc increase of >60 m illiseconds  from 
baseline. Study subjects will be asked to come in for an Early Termination Visit within 3 business days of 
study drug discontinuation.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Examination   
 
A complete physical and neurologic examination will be performed at the time of the initial and final 
study Visit , as well as during the early termination Visit , if applicable.  Abnormalities in the examination 
appreciated during Visit [ADDRESS_794372]’s known dystonia will be recorded and labeled as 
non-clinically significant.  Any and all changes in the examination happening during the course of the trial 
will be recorded  and reported , when appropriate . Figure 2 below shows the form that will  capture this

[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Safety  Endpoint   
50 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021   
The primary safety endpoint for the AUDYT trial will be the proportion of study subjects able to titrate 
up to 48 mg/d (or up to 36 mg/d if receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor) and able to complete the study 
at this dosage.  The reason(s) why subjects are unable to titrate or maintain the maximal recommended 
AUSTEDO dose will be recorded and reported, when appropriate.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Safety Endpoint s  
 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_599913] . Serious 
adverse events will be reported, as appropriate. Twelve lead ECG will be performed during all scheduled 
study Visits (including an early termination Visit, if one happens) to screen for prolongation of the QT 
interval. In addition, the following Scales will be assessed:  
 
1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.  
2. Stanford  Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110].  
3. Mini Mental Scale.  
4. MDS -Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.    
3.7.2  Efficacy Endpoints   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
 
The AUDYT trial will be a patient -driven study. Accordingly, the primary efficacy endpoint will be patient -
driven as well: during Visit 4, study subjects will be administered the Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement Scale (PGI -I), with which they will quantify the degree of change (if any) in their dystonic 
symptoms that is attributable to their participation in the trial. The median of all of these assessments 
will be considered the primary efficacy endpoint.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s  
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be:  
• the median of all CGI -I  
• within subjects paired t -tests to assess significance of change in the GDS between Visits 1 and 4.  
 
Both the CGI -I and GDS will be extracted by [CONTACT_599914], as mentioned elsewhere in this document.    
3.8 Criteria for Study Termination  
 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the trial at any time; reasons will be provided i n the event 
of this happening. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_599883]. The Investigator will notify the 
IRB/REC/IEC in writing of the trial’s completion or early termination and provide a copy of the 
notification to the Sponsor.

4. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS AND MANAGEMENT   
4.1 Study Drug   
4.1.1  Description  
 
As described in the drug’s package insert,3 AUSTEDO  (AUSTEDO ) is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 
(VMAT2) inhibitor for oral administration. The molecular weight of AUSTEDO  is 323.46; the pKa is 6.31. 
AUSTEDO  is a hexahydro -dimethoxybenzoquinolizine derivative and has the following chemical name: 
(RR, SS) -1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11b -hexahydro -9, 10 -di(methoxy -d3)-3-(2-methylpropyl)2H -benzo[a]quinolizin -2-
one. The molecular formula for AUSTEDO  is C 19H21D6NO 3. AUSTEDO  is a white to slightly yellow 
crystalline powder that is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol.  
  
52 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  AUSTEDO  tablets contain 6 mg, 9 mg, or 12 mg AUSTEDO , and the following inactive ingredients: 
ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, n -butyl alcohol, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated 
hydroxytoluene, magnesium stearate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, 
polyethylene oxide, polysorb ate 80, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, propylene glycol, shellac, talc, titanium 
dioxide, and FD&C blue #2 lake. The 6 mg tablets also contain FD&C red #40 lake. The 12 mg tablets also 
contain FD&C yellow # 6 lake.  Only 6 mg AUSTEDO tablets will be used in the AUDYT trial.   
4.1.2  Mechanism of action  
 
According to the package insert,3 the precise mechanism by [CONTACT_599915]  (AUSTEDO ) exerts anti -
chorea effects is unknown but is believed to be related to its effect as a reversible depletor of 
monoamines (such as dopamine, serotonin, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and histamine) from nerve terminals. The 
major circulating metabolites (α -dihydrotetrab enazine [HTBZ] and β -HTBZ) of AUSTEDO , are reversible 
inhibitors of VMAT2, resulting in decreased uptake of monoamines into synaptic vesicles and depletion 
of monoamine stores.    
4.1.3  Pharmacodynamics  
 
The following considerations are mentioned in AUSTEDO’s package insert:[ADDRESS_794391] of a single 12 -mg or 24 -mg dose of AUSTEDO  on the QT interval was studied in a randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled crossover study in healthy male and female subjects with moxifloxacin 
as a positive control. At 24 mg, AUSTEDO  caused an approximately 4.5  milliseconds mean increase in 
QTc (90% CI: 2.4, 6.5 msec). Effects at higher exposures to AUSTEDO  or its metabolites have not been 
evaluated. The effect of a single 25 -mg or 50 -mg dose of tetrabenazine, a closely related VMAT2 
inhibitor, on the QT interval was studied in a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled crossover 
study in healthy male and female subjects with moxifloxacin as a positive control. At 50 mg, 
tetrabenazine caused an approximately 8  milliseconds mean increase in QTc (90% CI: 5.0, 10.4 msec). 
Effects at higher exposures to either tetrabenazine or its metabolites have not been evaluated.  
 
Melanin Binding  
AUSTEDO  or its metabolites bind to melanin -containing tissues (i.e., eye, skin, fur) in pi[INVESTIGATOR_14922]. 
After a single oral dose of radiolabeled AUSTEDO , radioactivity was still detected in eye and fur at 35 
days following dosing.    
4.1.4  Pharmacokinetics  
 
As stated in the drug’s package insert,3 after oral dosing up to 25 mg, plasma concentrations of 
AUSTEDO  are generally below the limit of detection because of the extensive hepatic metabolism of 
AUSTEDO  to the active deuterated dihydro metabolites (HTBZ), α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ. Linear dose 
dependence of Cmax and AUC was observed for the active metabolites following single or multiple 
doses of AUSTEDO  (6 mg to 24 mg and 7.5 mg twice daily to 22.5 mg twice daily).   
 
Absorption  
Following oral administration of AUSTEDO , the extent of absorption is at least 80%.  Plasma 
concentrations of AUSTEDO  are generally below the limit of detection after oral dosing. Peak plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) of deuterated α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ are reached within [ADDRESS_794392] of Food   
53 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  The effects of food on the bioavailability of AUSTEDO  were studied in subjects administered a single 
dose with and without food. Food had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
(AUC) of α -HTBZ or β -HTBZ, although Cmax was increased by [CONTACT_3450] 50% in the presence of 
food.   
 
Distribution  
The median volume of distribution (Vc/F) of the α -HTBZ, and the β -HTBZ metabolites of AUSTEDO  are 
approximately [ADDRESS_794393] binding in the cortex. The in vit ro protein 
binding of tetrabenazine, α -HTBZ, and β -HTBZ was examined in human plasma for concentrations 
ranging f rom 50 to 200 ng/mL. Tetrabenazine binding ranged from 82% to 85%, α -HTBZ binding ranged 
from 60% to 68%, and β -HTBZ binding ranged from 59% to 63%.  
 
Elimination  
AUSTEDO  is primarily renally eliminated in the form of metabolites. The half -life of total (α+β) -HTBZ 
from AUSTEDO  is approximately 9 to 10 hours. The median clearance values (CL/F) of the α -HTBZ, and 
the β -HTBZ metabolites of AUSTEDO  are approximately 47 L/hour and 70 L/hour, respectively, in the 
Huntington’s disease patient population.   
 
Metabolism  
In vitro experiments in human liver microsomes demonstrate that AUSTEDO  is extensively 
biotransformed, mainly by [CONTACT_599916], to its major active metabolites, α -HTBZ and βHTBZ, 
which are subsequently metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]2D6, with minor contributions of CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4/5, to form several minor metabolites.   
 
Excretion  
In a mass balance study in 6 healthy subjects, 75% to 86% of the AUSTEDO  dose was excreted in the 
urine, and fecal recovery accounted for 8% to 11% of the dose. Urinary excretion of the α -HTBZ and β -
HTBZ metabolites from AUSTEDO  each accounted for less than 10% of the administered dose. Sulfate 
and glucuronide conjugates of the α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolites of AUSTEDO , as well as products of 
oxidative metabolism, accounted for the majority of metabolites in the urine.   
4.2 Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
 
As mentioned in the package insert,3 AUSTEDO  tablets are available in the following strengths and 
packages: 6 mg: round, purple -coated tablets, with “SD” over “6” printed in black ink on one side. 
Bottles of 60 tablets: NDC [ZIP_CODE] -170-60. 9 mg:  round, blue -coated tablets, with “SD” over “9” printed in 
black ink on one side. Bottles of 60 tablets: NDC [ZIP_CODE] -171-60. 12 mg:  round, beige -coated tablets, with 
“SD” over “12” printed in black ink on one side. Bottles of 60 tablets: NDC [ZIP_CODE] -172-60. Only 6 mg 
AUSTEDO tablets will be used in the AUDYT trial.    
4.3 Study Drug Storage  
 
As per the package insert,3 AUSTEDO will be s tore d at 25º C (77ºF); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30ºC 
(59°F to 86ºF). It will be p rotect ed from light and moisture.    
4.4 Administration   
4.4.1  Route of Administration and Dose Schedule  
  
54 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  According to the package insert,3 the dose of AUSTEDO  is determined individually for each patient with 
Huntington’s Disease based on reduction of chorea and tolerability.  When first prescribed to subjects  
who are not being switched from tetrabenazine (a related VMAT2 inhibitor), the recommended starting 
dose of AUSTEDO  is 6 mg admi nistered orally once daily. The dose of AUSTEDO  may be increased at 
weekly intervals in increments of 6 mg per day to a maximum recom mended daily dosage of 48 mg. 
Total daily dosages of 12 mg or above will be administered in two divided doses. AUSTEDO  will be 
administered with food. AUSTEDO  will be swa llowed whole. It will not be chew ed, crush ed or br oken . 
 
Based on these recommendations (and as shown in Table 3 below), for the purpose of the AUDYT trial, 
each study subject is expected to start, increase, maintain and then discontinue AUSTEDO 6 mg tablets 
as follows:

In subjects receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor , the ramp -up period will be reduced to 4 weeks, reducing 
the duration of their participation in the study to 11 weeks.   
4.4.2  Dose Increase / Dose Reduction  
 
As per the package insert,3 increments in AUSTEDO dosing will be done by 6 mg/week up to a maximum 
of 48 mg/day. Study subjects who are unable to tolerate this dose will be allowed to remain on the 
maximum well -tolerated dose of AUSTEDO. If this dose has not been previously establis hed, they will be 
instructed to reduce the total daily AUSTEDO dose by 6 mg (1 tablet) every day until the maximum well -
tolerated dose of AUSTEDO is established. A faster dose reduction will be allowed if deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_093]. In study subjects  receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, the maximum allowed dose of 
AUSTEDO  will be 36 mg/day . 
 
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_8644] a weekly basis via telephone during the ramp -up period to assess study 
drug tolerability. Dose reductions will be allowed in this period at the discretion of the investigator, but 
also during the maintenance period. A dose reduction during the ramp -up period will determine the 
start of the maintenance period, as it will be assumed that the new, lower AUSTEDO dose is the 
maximum well -tolerated dose of AUSTEDO for that study subject. Similarly, subje cts will remain on the 
new, ma ximum well -tolerated dose of AUSTEDO for the remainder of the trial once a dose reduction is 
done during the maintenance period.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors  
AUSTEDO  is contraindicated in subjects  taking MAOIs. In clinical practice, AUSTEDO  will not be used in 
combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI . 
 
Tetrabenazine  
AUSTEDO  is contraindicated in subjects  currently taking tetrabenazine. In clinical practice, AUSTEDO  
may be initiated the day following discontinuation of Tetrabenazine.  
 
AUSTEDO is also contraindicated in subjects:  
• Who are suicidal, or in subjects with untreated or inadequately treated depression.  
• With hepatic impairment.

participation in the AUDYT trial.  
 
Alcohol or other sedatives  
Concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs may have additive effects and worsen sedation and 
somnolence . As mentioned in the exclusion criteria, no change in the dose of psychoactive medications 
will be allowed for the duration of the trial, or at least [ADDRESS_794398] of medications that are known to prolong the QTc. Subjects taking these 
medication will be allowed to participate in the trial as long as their ECG during visit 1 (and while already 
on one or more of these drugs at steady state) shows no QTc prolongation. Any evidence of QTc 
prolongation during subsequent ECGs will require an adjustment in the AUSTEDO dose as detailed 
elsewhere. The introduction of these medications will not be allowed for the duration of the trial. If it is 
deter mined that a subject requires one of these medications during their participation in the trial, 
AUSTEDO will be stopped and the subject will be considered withdrawn from the trial.

5. ADVERSE EVENTS   
5.1 Definitions   
5.1.1  Adverse Event Definitions  
 
During the study, the Investigator or study site personnel will be responsible for querying and recording 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), as detailed in this section of the protocol.  This 
includes the weekly communications with the study subjects via telephone during the ramp -up period . 
In this study AEs and SAEs will be reported from the time of study drug administration until the last 
study Visit  or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in conjunction with the use of a 
medicinal product in humans, whether or not considered to have a causal relationship to the medicinal 
product.  An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not it is a direct consequence of study drug use.  
 
Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the first 
date of study drug administration will be considered to be pre -existing, and will not be recorded  as an 
AE. Any AE (i.e., a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) with an onset date after 
study drug administration up to and including the designated follow -up safety Visit  will be recorded as 
an AE . All AEs will be  recorded regardless of the severity or relationship to study medication . All AEs that 
result in permanent discontinuation of the study drug being studied, whether serious or nonserious , will 
be reported .  
 
An AE does include:  
 
• an exacerbation of a pre -existing illness  
• an increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]  
• a condition detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may have 
been present prior to the start of the study  
• persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline which worsen fo llowing the start of the 
study  
  
60 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  An AE does not include:  
 
• medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion) Note:  in 
this case, the condition tha t led to the procedure is an AE   
• pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected prior to start of study drug 
administration, which do not worsen  
• the disease or disorder being studied or a sign or symptom associated with that disease (i.e., 
signs or symptoms associated with lack of efficacy will generally be considered to reflect 
underlying disease, rather than AEs)  
• situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10800], social, and/or convenience admissions)  
• overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms  
 
All AEs will be  fully and completely recorded.  The following attributes will be  assigned: description of AE, 
dates and times of onset and resolution (or whether ongoing), severity, causality to study drug, whether 
an SAE or not, and action taken (i.e., no action taken; study medication interrupted; study medication 
discontinued; othe r).  
 
In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study becau se of an AE, it will be recorded.  The subject 
will be followed and treated by [CONTACT_599918] a new chronic baseline has 
been established. The investigator will report all directly observed AEs and all spontaneously reported 
AEs.  At each Visit  the investigator will ask the subject a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed 
anything different since your last Visit ?”) to assess whether any AEs have occurred since the last report 
or Visit . AEs wi ll be identified and recorded  in appropriate medical terminology.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Common A dverse Events  
 
According to the package insert, [ADDRESS_794401] 4% of subjects  on AUSTEDO  
and with a greater incidence than on placebo  include s omnolence , diarrhea , dry mouth , fatigue , urinary 
tract infection , insomnia , anxiety , constipation  and c ontusion .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that:  
 
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (subject is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316886]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug  
• is a significant or important medical event, i.e., an event that, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the above mentioned criteria (examples of such events a re intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
When a causality assessment is provided for an SAE, a rationale for the assessment  will be included , so 
that a better understanding of the reported event can be compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602].  The rationale will be accompanied 
by [CONTACT_209789], including relevant laboratory tests, histopathology evaluations, and  
61 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  the results of other diagnostic procedures.  The Investigator’s rationale with supporting evidence is 
valuable when the Sponsor performs a cumulative analysis of similar events.  
 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any serious adverse event that is 
considered related to the investigational product, and that is also unexpected.  S[LOCATION_003]Rs qualify for 
expedited reporting to applicable Health Authorities and IRB/REB/IECs.  
 
According to the package insert,3 the following serious adverse reactions can happen with the use of 
AUSTEDO:  
 
• Depression and suicidality: Subjects  with Huntington’s disease are at increased risk for 
depression, and suicidal ideation or behaviors (suicidality). AUSTEDO  may increase the risk for 
suicidality in subjects  with Huntington’s disease.  In a 12 -week, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
trial, suicidal ideation was reported by 2% of subjects  treated with AUSTEDO , compared to no 
subjects  on placebo; no suicide attempts and no completed suicides were reported. Depression 
was reported by 4% of subjects  treated with  AUSTEDO . 
• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to 
as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with drugs that 
reduce dopaminergic transmission. While NMS has not been observed in subjects  receiving 
AUSTEDO , it has been observed in subjects  receiving tetrabenazine (a closely related VMAT2 
inhibitor). The management of NMS will include (1) immediate discontinuation of AUSTEDO ; (2) 
intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any 
concomitant serious medical problems for which spe cific treatments are available. Recurrence 
of NMS has been reported with resumption of drug therapy , and, thus, any subject developi[INVESTIGATOR_599887] . 
• Akathisia, agitation and restlessness: AUSTEDO  may increase the risk of akathisia, agitation, and 
restlessness in subjects  with Huntington’s disease. In a 12 -week, double -blind, placebo -
controlled trial, akathisia, agitation, or restlessness was reported by 4% of subjects  treated with 
AUSTEDO , compared to 2% of subjects  on placebo. If a patient develops akathisia during 
treatment with AUSTEDO , the AUSTEDO  dose will be reduced; some subjects  may require 
discontinuation of therapy  and withdrawal from the tria l. 
• Parkinsonism: AUSTEDO  may cause parkinsonism in subjects  with Huntington’s disease.  Drug -
induced parkinsonism has the potential to cause more functional disability than untreated 
chorea for some subjects  with Huntington’s disease. If a patient develops parkinsonism during 
treatment with AUSTEDO , the AUSTEDO  dose will be reduced; some subjects  may require 
discontinuation of therapy.  
• Sedation and somnolence: Sedation is a common dose -limiting adverse reaction of AUSTEDO . In 
a 12 -week, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, 11% of AUSTEDO -treated subjects  reported 
somnolence compared with 4% of subjects  on placebo and 9% of AUSTEDO -treated subjects  
reported fatigue compared with 4% of placebo -treated subjects . 
• QTc prolongation: Tetrabenazine increases the QTc by [CONTACT_2902] 8 msec. A clinically relevant QT 
prolongation may occur in subjects  treated with AUSTEDO  who are co -administered a strong 
CYP2D6 inhibitor , which is why these subjects will not be allowed to titrate to more than 36 
mg/day.  
• Hyperprolactinemia: Tetrabenazine elevates serum prolactin concentrations, but it is unclear 
whether AUSTEDO has this effect. Caution is advised with the use of AUSTEDO in subjects with 
62 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  known or suspected hyperprolactinemia, or in subjects with breast cancer with prolactin 
receptors.  
• Binding to Melanin -Containing tissues: Possible accumulation of AUSTEDO in these tissues over 
time could cause long -term ophthalmologic effects.   
5.1.2  Adverse Event Assessment Definitions   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severi ty  
 
The severity of each AE/SAE will be classified into one of three defined categories as follows:  
 
• Mild:  the AE is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and does not interfere 
in a significant manner with the subject’s normal functioning level or activities  
• Moderate:  the AE is sufficiently uncomfortable to interfere with normal everyday activities, but 
is not hazardous to health  
• Severe:  the AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite 
hazard to the subject’s health.  
 
These three categories are based on the investigator’s clinical judgment, which in turn depends on 
consideration of various factors such as the subject’s reports, the physician’s observations, and the 
physician’s prior experience.     
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causal Relationship  
 
The Investigator will assess and record the causal relationship between the AE and the study drug using 
the following definitions:  
 
• Probable: the AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug , and another etiology is 
unlikely or significantly less likely.  
• Possible: the AE has a suggestive temporal relationship to the study drug , and an alternative 
etiology is equally or less likely.  
• Not related: the AE has no temporal relationship to the study drug or is due to 
underlying/concurrent illness or effect of another drug (that is, there is no causal relationship 
between the  study drug and the adverse event).  
 
An AE will be  considered causally related to the use of the study drug when the causality assessment is 
probable or possible.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Outcome  
 
The Investigator  will assess  and record  the outcome of the AE using the following definitions:  
 
• Recovered: the subject has recovered completely, and no symptoms remain.  
• Recovering: the subject’s condition is improving, but symptoms still remain.  
• Recovered with sequelae: the subject has reco vered, but some symptoms remain  
• Not recovered: the subject’s condition has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged  
• Death    
5.2 Pregnancy  
 
Risk Summary   
63 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of AUSTEDO  in pregnant 
women. Administration of AUSTEDO  to rats during organogenesis produced no clear adverse effect on 
embryofetal development. However, administration of tetrabenazine to rats throughout pregnancy and 
lactation resulted in an increase in stillbirths a nd postnatal offspring mortality . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized 
pregnancies is 2 -4% and 15 -20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and 
miscarriage for the indicated popul ation is unknown.   
 
Data  
Animal Data  
Oral administration of AUSTEDO  (5, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day) or tetrabenazine (30 mg/kg/day) to pregnant 
rats during organogenesis had no clear effect on embryofetal development. The highest dose tested was 
6 times the maximum recommended human dose of 48 mg/day, on a bo dy surface area (mg/m2) basis. 
The effects of AUSTEDO  when administered during organogenesis to rabbits or during pregnancy and 
lactation t o rats have not been assessed. Tetrabenazine had no effects on embryofetal development 
when administered to pregnant rabbits during the p eriod of organogenesis at oral doses up to 60 
mg/kg/day. When tetrabenazine was administered to female rats (doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day) 
from the beginning of organogenesis through the lactation period, an increase in stillbirths and offspring 
postna tal mortality was observed at 15 and 30 mg/kg/day, and delayed pup maturation was observed at 
all doses.  
 
A pregnancy is not an AE.  If a subject becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study following 
administration of study drug, the Sponsor or designee will be  notified within [ADDRESS_794402] will be followed through the outcome of the pregnancy.    
5.3 Recording Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events will be  recorded  on an Adverse Event Documentation Form (see Figure 1). The 
investigator will provide information on the AE, preferably with a diagnosis, or at least with signs and 
symptoms; start and stop dates, start and stop time; intensity; causal relationship to study drug ; action 
taken; and outcome. If the AE is an overdose, the nature of the overdose will be  stated (medication 
error, accidental overdose, or intentional overdose). If the AE is serious, this will be  indicated on the 
Adverse Event Form. Furthermore, the Investigator  will report the SAE to Teva within 24 hou rs after 
becoming aware of it .   
5.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
 
The Investigator will report SAEs to Teva immediately (within 24 hours) after becoming aware of them 
by [CONTACT_12550] a Serious Adverse Event Form.  As much information as possible will be  recorded . If more 
information about the patient’s condition becomes available at a later date, the Serious Adverse Event 
Form will be  updated w ith the additional information. Teva will assume responsibility for reporting SAEs 
to the authorities in accordance with U.S. regulations.    
5.[ADDRESS_794403] treatment evaluation , information on new SAEs, if any, and stop dates for 
previously reported AEs  will be  recorded. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to follow up on SAEs

7. STUDY DOCUMENTATION  AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]    
7.1 Investigator’s Files and Retention of Study Data   
 
The Investigator will maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be 
fully recorded  and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents will be  separated into 
two categories: Investigator’s study file and pat ient clinical source documents, as follows:  
 
1. The Investigator’s study file will contain the protocol and protocol amendments (if applicable), 
query forms, IRB and governmental regulatory approval with correspondence, informed 
consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms and other appropriate 
documents and correspondence.   
66 
 
Amendment 1.1 – 20Jan2021  2. Patient clinical source documents  may include patient and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599888], 
physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, X -ray, 
pathology and special assessment reports, consultant’s letters, screening and enrollment log, 
etc.  
 
The patient’s involvement in the study will be  clearly recorded  in the study site’s clinical records. Details 
will include the study protocol number, the patient’s study number, the patient’s consent to take part in 
the study (including the date of consent), the dates of all study Visit s, details of any treatments 
withdrawn because of study participation, the dates of dispensing study drug , details of any AEs 
(including any SAEs), and changes in concomitant medications. The documents in these two categories  
will be kept on file by [CONTACT_12103] 15  years after completion or termination of the study. 
Study documents will not be destroyed without prior written agreement between Teva  and the 
Investigator. If the Investigator wishes to assign the study records to another party or move them to 
another location, Teva  will be notified in advance. If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving 
requirement for any or all the documents at the investigational site, arrangements will be made 
between t he Investigator and Teva  to store these in a sealed container(s) outside the site. The sealed 
container(s) can therefore be returned to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source 
documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_599889] .

documentation or clinic records.  In case of special problems and/or governmental queries or requests 
for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have direct access to the completed study records, provided 
that patient confidentiality is protected.    
7.3 Monitoring, Verification of Data, Audit, and Inspection   
 
The Teva  monitor  may periodically Visit  the site to discuss the progress of the study and review source 
documents with the study personnel, for accuracy of data recording, study drug acco untability, and 
correspondence.  The Investigator will ensure that the study participants are aware of and consent that 
personal information may be reviewed during the data verification process as part of 
monitoring/auditing by [CONTACT_599919] n by [CONTACT_3527].  In addition, participation and personal information is treated as strictly confidential to the 
extent the applicable law permit s and not publically available.   
 
The Investigator will notify Teva  of an announced inspection by a regulatory authority. During audits and 
inspections, the Investigator will allow access to all the source documents, including medical records and 
other documents pertinent to the study. During audits and inspections, the auditors and inspectors may 
copy relevant parts of medical records. No personal identification apart from the study number will 
appear on these copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Patient data will not be disclosed to unauthorized third parties, and pa tient 
confidentiality will be maintained at  all times.

Study Rationale:  Heart failure (HF) is epi[INVESTIGATOR_497482] (1) as the population of older adults 
expands. While age stands out as a leading risk factor for HF incidence as well as for poor 
HF prognosis (2), few HF trials 
focus specifically on aging physiology as a key determinant of 
the disease and as a pertinent therapeutic target. Consistently, 
HF trials have tended to focus primarily on central mechanisms 
of cardiac pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_497483] (3) despi[INVESTIGATOR_497484] -
outcomes are strongly related to functional decrements that are 
largely mediated by [CONTACT_654]- (4) and disease- related (5) peripheral 
manifestations. HF- related skeletal muscle myopathy is a 
component of HF that diminishes physical function, and which 
is likely exacerbated by [CONTACT_497530], vascular stiffening, and 
other aspects of aging such that exercise intolerance is 
disproportionate among older HF populations as well as its 
insidious clinical implications (6). In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_115834], we will study older (age ≥ 70 years) adults, including patients with HF 
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), patients with HF with 
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and age -matched healthy 
controls, to study benefits of enteral  nitrite therapy (in addition 
to established standards of HF care) to improve physical 
function. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_497485] (maximal and 
submaximal) and strength (maximal, endurance, and power) 
indices as well as underlying skeletal muscle mechanisms 
(skeletal muscle mitochondrial performance, gene expression, 
and capi[INVESTIGATOR_26999]). Studies have demonstrated nitrite therapy 
increases ATP synthesis in skeletal muscle mitochondria 
concomitant  with reduced whole- body oxygen cost during 
steady state exercise (15). Our own work has demonstrated 
safety and efficacy of a FDA- IND approved sodium nitrite (10 
mg) tablet, and its utility to upregulate the SIRT3 -AMP pathway 
of skeletal muscle of younger  HF patients (16).  
Study Objectives:  Studies have demonstrated nitrite therapy increases ATP 
synthesis in skeletal muscle mitochondria concomitant with 
reduced whole- body oxygen cost during steady state exercise 
(15). Our own work has demonstrated safety and efficacy of a FDA-IND approved sodium nitrite (10 mg) capsule, and its utility 
to upregulate the SIRT3-
AMPpathway of skeletal muscle of 
younger HF patients (16). It now seems exceptionally logical

 and opportune to apply these insights to older HF patients and 
to delineate mechanisms of disease and aging that respond to 
nitrite therapy.     
Study Hypothesis:  Oral supplementation with nitrite  will intrinsically improve  
skeletal muscle performance in HF as a vital means to improve 
physical function and moderate effects of disease itself as well 
as well as to frailties and enfeeblements associated with the 
disease. This will potentially improve efficacy and quality of car e, 
and also potentially mitigate the skyrocketing costs associated 
with aggregate HF management.  
Study Aims:   
1.  To demonstrate that oral nitrite pi[INVESTIGATOR_497486] .   
2.  To show that oral supp lements are manifest as 
increased plasma nitrite.  
3.  To show that increased plasma nitrite is associated with 
improved skeletal muscle (mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) and 
platelet (Seahorse XF) metabolism. 
4.  To demonstrate that improved metabolism is associated 
with shifts in skeletal muscle anabolic gene expression 
(FNDC5, PGC1α, Sirtuin 3) as well as reduced catabolic gene 
expression (ubiquitin [MuRF, Atrogin1]) and inflammation 
(TNFα, IL -1β, IL -6). 
5.  To demonstrate that improved skeletal physiology 
achieved using oral nitrate pi[INVESTIGATOR_497487] .  
6. To show that oral nitrite supplements increase efficiency 
of work, i.e., reduced oxygen uptake (VO2) required for the 
same work intensity.  
Study Design: The study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of oral nitrite 
in adults with HFrEF , HFpEF or healthy control .

BACKGROUND 
 1.3. Longevity is increasing in the [LOCATION_002] and much of the world, and the older adult 
population is growing as more people are surviving into old age (13). Since aging is also associated with predictable morphological and physiological changes that are conducive to 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), prevalence of CVD is increasing as the older adult population 
expands (6,17). Consistently, prevalence of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are both growing (18). HFrEF and HFpEF are associated with high morbidity and mortality among older adults, as well as with 
decreased quality of life and increased dependency. Vulnerability to and consequences from 
exercise intolerance are especially significant in older HF patients. Both HFrEF and HFpEF are 
associated with reduced type 1 skeletal muscle fibers (7,8,9), and clinical manifestations are 
compounded by [CONTACT_654]- related reductions of type 2 muscle fibers (19) as well as associated 
predispositions to increased interstitial fat and inflammation in skeletal muscle (20,21). Exercise 
intolerance in HFrEF and HFpEF is common and insidious, and predisposes to HF’s notoriously 
poor outcomes and associated (high) costs (stemming from increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], increased 
dependency, and increased frailty). Interventions to intrinsically improve skeletal muscle health may prove vital therapeutic benefit and also help moderate today’s mounting healthcare expenditures.  
 
Peripheral mechanisms of exercise intolerance  in HFrEF have been recognized for many years. 
Seminal work by [CONTACT_165166], Massie, and Hambrecht (6) and other preeminent investigators have demonstrated diminished type I skeletal muscle fibers, mitochondria (size and density), and capi[INVESTIGATOR_497492]. Related work has demonstrated increased inflammation (particularly 
TNFα) (22) and increased in ubiquitin proteolysis, myostatin, and other catabolic factors in HFrEF 
(23). While skeletal muscle changes associated with HFpEF have often seemed more ambiguous 
than in HFrEF, recent work by [CONTACT_497532]. demonstrates decrements in Type I fibers in HFpEF 
similar to those seen in HFrEF, and correlation to similar reductions in peak oxygen uptake (VO2) 
(9). 
 
There has been much enthusiasm about the utility of exercise training to modify HF skeletal muscle changes (24,  25). Benefits have been established in HFrEF and HFpEF, but training for 
either is also similarly confounded by [CONTACT_497533], especially those who are older and who are also inherently prone age- related pulmonary disease (COPD, pulmonary 
hypertension, sleep apnea), metabolic disease (diabetes), osteoarthritis depression, and other 
morbidities, as well as to geriatric syndromes (frailty, falls, incontinence, sensory impairment s, 
poor sleep) and logistic impediments (transportation, financial) (13). Even HF- ACTION, a well-

 funded trial that included significant behavioral components to reinforce exercise compliance in a 
large HFrEF study population, achieved notably suboptimal ex ercise adherence (14).  
 Nitrite therapy is a relatively novel concept to potentially modify skeletal muscle bioenergetics and 
which may thereby [CONTACT_497534]. Shiva et al demonstrated the capacity of nitrite to be converted nitric oxide (NO) in response to ischemic stress. NO then can bind to cytochrome c 
oxidase of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, reducing electron transport chain and 
utilization (26,  27). Key clinical correlates in multiple animal and human trials include increased  
exercise time and decrease oxygen uptake (VO2) efficiency (i.e., reduced VO2 for an equivalent workload). In one such trial Larsen et al. compared healthy men before and after dietary nitrate supplements. Gross efficiency increased from 19.7 ±1.6 to 21.1±1.3%, with no differences in heart 
rate, lactate, ventilation (VE), VE/VO2, or the respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] (RER) indicating this was 
mediated purely as an intrinsic skeletal muscle change (28). Nitrite rich beetroot juice 
supplementation has been demonstrated to improve time required to achieve a pre -specified work 
level for several sports and to also improve performance during intense intermittent exercise (29).  
 
1.4 SIGNIFICANCE 
 
The proposed research responds to a critical need to elucidate peripheral mec hanisms that 
contribute to functional limitations of older HF in older adults (i.e., abnormal skeletal muscle 
bioenergetics) and to assess the related benefits of a novel therapy that can potentially mitigate 
these abnormalities, and thereby [CONTACT_497535].  Theoretically, both HFrEF and HFpEF patients may benefit.  Potential benefits pertaining to 
HFpEF patients are particularly exciting to consider,  as currently there is no established therapy 
for this common disease.  
 
2.   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
2.1 CLASSIFICATION AND METHODOLOGICAL DESIGNS  
 
The study is a 4-week  open- label, single -center, non- randomized drug treatment study of 3 
groups: HFpEF, HFrEF, healthy age- matched controls.   
 
2.2 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STUDY DESIGN  
 
Subjects will undergo a screening visit to determine that eligibility requirements are met. Pr ior to 
receiving the study drug, subjects will be scheduled within 4 weeks of screening  for a baseline 
assessment.  
Subjects who meet the Inclusion Criteria and none of the Exclusion Criteria will be provided study  
drug. The study population (n=30) will receive oral sodium nitrite combination for 4 weeks:  
 
Drug : oral formulation of sodium nitrite 20 or 40 mg oral three times daily or TID (once in 
the morning and again in the early afternoon and again in the evening)  
 
Subjects will complete a 4- week outpatient treatment period. During the treatment period, subjects 
will be evaluated at weekly intervals. Throughout the study period, subjects will be asked to remain 
diligent in recording the time of study drug dosing and any associated symptoms  (diary cards will 
be pre -dated) . 
 
2.2.1. Study Drug Preparation and Distribution 
Oral Nitrite for Older Heart Failure Patients  Sponsor: Mark T. Gladwin, MD  
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
11 
 The nitrite formulations will be prepared at and obtained from the Investigational Drug Pharmacy 
Service at the National Institutes of Health (NIH -IDS). The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_497493] (UPMC- IDS) will be utilized for dispensing of the study 
drug.  
 
The daily study drug is : 
 
14N Sodium nitr ite  
Standard sodium nitrite will be supplied as one or two 20 mg capsules , three times daily oral 
administration at the dose strength of 60 or 120 mg  qd. 
 2.2.2. Dose Selection  
The Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (W HO) Expert 
Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) proposed an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for nitrate in 1990 based on harmless daily intakes of ≤500 mg of sodium nitrate/per kg of body weight in rats 
and dogs. They divided this dose by [CONTACT_497536] 100 to yield an ADI of 5 mg of sodium 
nitrate or 3.7 mg nitrate ion per kg of body weight. An ADI for nitrite ion was derived and revised in 2003 based on intakes of 10 mg of sodium nitrite or 6.7 mg nitrite ion per kg of body weight in 
rats. They div ided this dose by [CONTACT_497536] 100 and rounded to yield an ADI for sodium 
nitrite of 0.1 mg/kg of body weight.  
 
A recent modeling of the fruit and vegetable consumption patterns of The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was done choosing foods that were low or high in nitrate. The 
“high nitrate” DASH diet pattern would result in consumption of 1,222 mg nitrate ion and 0.351 
mg nitrite ion daily. The “low nitrate” DASH diet would result in consumption of 174 mg nitrate ion 
and 0.41 mg nitrite ion daily. The hypothetical high- nitrate DASH diet pattern exceeds the WHO’s 
ADI for nitrate ion by 550% for a 60 -kg adult. Subjects on this diet exhibited lower blood pressure 
with no adverse effects.  
 
In a recent study, single dose potassium nitrate (KNO3) capsule ingestion in healthy adult 
volunteers in doses of 2,424 mg KNO3 (or 1,488 mg nitrate) and 1,212 mg KNO3 (or 744 mg 
nitrate) resulted in dose dependent reductions in BP over a 24 hour period without adverse effects.  
 
Hunault et al. reported an open- label pharmacokinetic crossover study in 9 healthy adult subjects 
who received two single high dose oral sodium nitrite solutions equivalent to 290- 380 mg and 
140-190 mg sodium nitrite, respectively, and one intravenous sodium nitrite dose of 290 -380 mg. 
Mild headache occurred in 44- 55% and up to 22% experienced nausea, which subsided within 
half an hour during each treatment session. Lowered blood pressure accompanied by [CONTACT_497537], whereas the lower dose did not induce 
notable changes.  
 Chronic dietary supplementation of inorganic sodium nitrate in obese, hypertensive, insulin 
resistant mice lacking the gene for endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) (20) was studied. With a [ADDRESS_639830] dose of sodium nitrate of 0.1 mmol/kg/day (8.5 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water, significant reductions in blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, and 
proinsulin to insulin ratio were demonstrated, indicating reduced demands on the β -cell for insulin 
secretion.  
 
Sodium nitrate drug is considered a source of nitrite through salivary nitrate reduction. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_497494] a single oral sodium nitrate dose, Drs. Gladwin, Hughan and Shiva 
recently demonstrated in a phase I PK/PD study in [ADDRESS_639831], in the same phase I PK/PD study in

12 
 10 normal volunteers, they showed blood pressure decline in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial 
pressures over 3 hours  with sodium nitrite 20 mg. The oral sodium nitrite half -life was about 40 -
minutes and the effects of nitrite only lasted ≤6 hours. This was demonstrated by [CONTACT_497538] 3 and 6 hours after nitrite dosing (i.e. the drug 
was given and gone out of the circulation within 6 hours). Specifically, mean baseline (pre- nitrite 
dosing) blood nitrite concentrations were 0.129 micromolar with a peak at 30 minutes of 5.5 
micromolar, and return to baseline levels between the 3 - (0.176 micromolar) and 6- hour (0.103 
micromolar) monitoring time points. In addition, there were no serious adverse events when these normotensive individuals received sodium nitrite.  
 
Next, a recently published study (Mohler III ER, Hiatt WR, Gorni k HL, Kevil CG, Quyyumi A, 
Haynes WG, Annex BH. Sodium nitrite in patients with peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus: safety, walking distance and endothelial function. Vascular Medicine 2014; 19(1):10- 17) 
randomized adults 1:1:1 to oral sodium nitrite 40 mg BID vs. 80 mg BID vs. placebo for 10 weeks in >50 adults (age 35 -85 years) with peripheral arterial disease +/ - diabetes. The dose was 
escalated after the 10 weeks for 1 additional week in all 3 groups (dose- doubling) to 80 mg BID 
vs. 160 mg BID vs. doubling of placebo, respectively. The dosing was well tolerated, especially in 
the 40 mg BID and 80 mg BID randomized dosings. (Our proposed study dosing of 20-40 mg TID 
(60-120 mg total daily) falls just below and in the middle of  the a bove two total daily doses of 80 
mg and 160 mg daily. ) Safety was monitored throughout all aspects of the study. No serious 
adverse events occurred in the two sodium nitrite groups. There were no imbalances in GI, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], vascular or skin disorders nor shifts in liver function or creatinine levels. Pertinent safety outcomes revealed that methemoglobin changes never exceeded 3% in 
any nitrite dose regimen and no clinically significant change in resting blood pressure.  
 A current phase II study of inhaled nitrite in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_497495] a dose of [ADDRESS_639832] tolerated 40 mg po tid without 
incident; the one exception was a subject who had a decrease in systolic BP at pK but was 
asymptomatic. In the three heart failure subjects enrolled to date we have observed a vasoactive 
response at the pK with the [ADDRESS_639833] a greater vasodilatory response to nitrite and could require a stratified dose based on age and baseline risk for hypotension. To further ameliorate risk, we will serve a standardized meal prior to drug dosing 
at Visit 3 so that lack of po intake is not a causative factor of hypotension.  
 In summary, b ased on the above findings , inclusive of : 
• The Joint FAO/WHO ADI for sodium nitrate and nitrite , 
• the above DASH diet patterns , 
• the recently observed human and rodent effects of nitrate and nitrite on blood pressure and glucose homeostasis , including our PK/PD trial of single doses of oral nitrate and 
nitrite , 
• the open label trial safety and BP findings following a total of 10 subjects' completion, 
• the existing inhaled nitrite trial, 
• the preliminary findings of the current nitrite protocol  with regard to blood pressure in heart 
failure subjects ,

 the study investigators believe that a safe and likely therapeutically effective dose of sodium nitrite 
will be 20-40 mg three times daily (~ 0.21-0.42 mg/kg body weight per day for a [ADDRESS_639834]). 
The 40 mg  sodium nitrite dose selection is equivalent to 12.6 times the ADI.  
 
2.2.3. Treatment Period  
Subjects will undergo study treatment duration of 4 weeks of 14N sodium nitrite 20-40 mg three 
times daily. This is considered appropriate to study benefits of oral nitrite therapy to improve 
physical function in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF and age- matched controls.  
 2.2.4. Safety Monitoring:  
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_497539], assessing 
adverse events, interval histories and medication compliance. 
 In addition to these phone evaluations, subjects will be encouraged to immediately contact [CONTACT_403380]/or the study coordinator with questions, concerns, or to report new 
symptoms that occur during their study participation. If there are particular concerns that need  to 
be addressed the subject will be asked to return to the EMRC or SMART Center  as soon as 
possible for evaluation.  Evaluations will be planned on an individual basis (depending on each 
individual’s circumstances) and may include weight, vital signs, methemoglobin %, medication 
compliance review, and assessment by  [CONTACT_5989].  If appropriate, based upon the 
evaluation, medical treatments will be provided to subjects, including appropriate referral to physicians or other services at the UPMC.  
 2.2.5. Medication Compliance  
Subjects will self -administer their first dose of study medication under the supervision of the CTRC 
nurse ( physician investigator  will be immediately available)  in the outpatient CTRC during Visit 3 , 
following completion of all baseline clinic assessments. Subjects will also be dispensed their study medication ( 42-day supply) for home use , including four 7 -day prefilled and labelled pi[INVESTIGATOR_497496]/symptom diary cards  to help with compliance and to help reduce burden or confusion. 
(Visit 4 may be scheduled up to and on the 42
nd day from visit 3 (25- 35±5 days) ; additional drug 
will be distributed with the initial dispensation if needed to meet the need.) Subjects will return the previously dispensed study medication when they return for Visit 4 approximately 4 weeks later 
(+1 week if need be for flexibility of scheduling) and medication compliance will be assessed. The 
study coordinator will review the daily diary card with each phone call evaluation and also assess 
medication compliance  with queries regarding empty pi[INVESTIGATOR_497497]  7-day box 
and remaining boxes . In the event that the compliance rate is <80%  (subjects’ report of doses 
taken/total doses prescribed at that date & time *100) , subjects will be re- educated on medication 
compliance. If medication compliance repeatedly falls outside of the acceptable range, the study investigators will discuss subject eligibility for continued participation in the study.  
 
2.2.6. Medication Accountability  
The study investigators or the study coordinator will document the amount of study drug 
dispensed and/or administered to subjects, the amount returned by [CONTACT_1766], and the amount 
received from and returned to the UPMC -IDS. The study drug accountability records will be 
maintained throughout the course of the clinical trial.  
 Dose reduction 
There is a rare possibility that subjects  will have a high methemoglobin level or low blood pressure 
from the study drug dose during visit 3 or while they are on the drug. If this happens, they may 
experience lightheadedness or dizziness.    
 
In CTRC:

to proceed with study participation prior to discharge from CTRC . This will include  what dose is 
appropriate  and drug dispensing.  The same process will be applied to subjects who are initially 
initiated on 20 mg; however, in these subjects  there is relatively greater consideration of 
withdra wal as no lower  dosing options are  available. 
 
As outpatient:  
Blood pressure and  related symptoms . If subjects  experience lightheadedness or dizziness after 
visit [ADDRESS_639836] that they call the study coordinator who will inventory 
their symptoms, compare to baseline levels  (measured at pK), and discuss need for interim visit 
with study physician. If a visit is indicated, we will measure blood pressure, RR, heart rate,  and 
check methemoglobin level by a finger probe. A study physician will evaluate each subject, 
including:  
1. review of all clinical measures,  
2. subject history of symptoms,  
3. blood pressures pre- and while on drug.  
The physician will confirm a management plan including the possibility of lowering dose to 20 mg tid or need to discontinue and drop from the trial. Subjects will be reassessed via phone each day 
for the next 2 days thereafter to ensure that the patient is stable on the new dose.   If stable, 
subjects will continue with the half dose.   However if there are continued symptoms on lower 
doses, the physician investigator will reevaluate the patient’s suitability for continued participation based on symptoms and/or hemodynamics.  
If subjects initiated at Visit 3 on the 20 mg dose report symptoms as described above, the same process will be followed; however, the physician may have to withdraw the subject since a dose 
lower than 20 mg tid is not an option.  
 
 
Methemoglobin.  If subjects report change in skin tone and dizziness  or other signs of 
methemoglobinemia for >24 hours, an interim visit will be requested. Methemoglobin will be 
assessed. If greater than 5%, a nitrite dose reduction is proposed from [ADDRESS_639837], s ubjects will be requested to come in for repeat methemoglobin testing after 3 days.   If 
level persists above 5%, participation in the study for the  subject  will be discontinued.  
 Safety of holding anti -platelet or antithrombotic medications  
The research physician and the staff under his auspi[INVESTIGATOR_497498]-thrombotic medications. In each case, this will be discussed doctor to doctor by [CONTACT_497540]’s PCP  or cardiologist .  
 
 2.3 STUDY ASSESSMENT  
 The complete study assessment and procedures are outlined in Table 1.  
 
2.3.1. Study Visits  and Procedures  
 
Visit 1 (Screening)  
 
Oral Nitrite for Older Heart Failure Patients  Sponsor: Mark T. Gladwin, MD  
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
[ADDRESS_639838] in either the Montefiore Clinical and Translational 
Research Center (CTRC) or the Endocrinology Metabolism Research Center (EMRC) at the 
UPMC Montefiore Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497499] 2- 3 hours.  
 • Obtain written informed consent  
• Complete history and physical examination to include body weight and height  
• Medical history obtained prior to visit will be reviewed with subject. Subjects will be asked 
questions about any heart disease and related diseases in first degree relatives; no identifying 
information will be obtained.[CONTACT_173505] will review risk factors for hypotension in subjects who are 70 to less than 80 years of age at the physical exam,  in preparation for dose selection.  
Subjects will be asked while they are in the study to report promptly any changes in their health 
or medications so that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_497500].  
• Hemoglobin and hematocrit to assess for anemia  
• Blood pressure and other vital signs  (temperature, pulse oximetry, breathing rate, heart rate)  
Blood pressure may be re- measured multiple times if out of inclusion range. This is to allow for 
influences of medication activation, subject nervousness, lack of fluid intake, and known facto rs 
which contribute to clinical variation.   
• Transthoracic Echocardiogram (performed by [CONTACT_3665]) - results of echo will confirm 
group placement. If subjects have had an echocardiogram within [ADDRESS_639839] may be 
transported to a lab in the UPMC Presby[CONTACT_194840]/Montefiore system  for the echocardiogram.  
 Scree ning evaluations will include a hemoglobin and hematocrit by [CONTACT_497541][INVESTIGATOR_497501]. The total volume of blood 
drawn is approximately 1 teaspoon (4 mL). If laboratory results exclude low hemoglobin (<11.0 
g/dL males, <10.0 females ) the subject will be called to arrange the baseline assessments. 
 Subjects who fail to meet applicable inclusion/exclusion criteria based upon the results of the 
screening assessment will be excluded from further study participation.   
An important component of the protocol is the muscle biopsy. Subjects who refuse the first biopsy 
will be excluded at screening. Participants who undergo the first biopsy at Visit 3 may refuse a 
second pass. (Participants may also refuse a second biopsy pass at Visit 5). However, participants who refuse to complete a second biopsy at Visit 5 (prior to starting sodium nitrite) will be withdrawn from the study. Alternatively, patients who refuse the 2nd biopsy after they have 
completed the 4 weeks of nitrite therapy will still be included.  
 Visit 2 (First Baseline Assessment Visit)  
 Subjects will be scheduled for an outpatient EMRC and Pepper SMART Center visit within [ADDRESS_639840] approximately 3 hours.  
 
Interval history and brief physical exam: temperature, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, breathing 
rate, heart rate and body weight  
 Physical Function Battery:  
● Cardiopulmonary Stress Exercise Testing: Exercise testing in association with air -gas-
exchange, an optimal gauge of aerobic capacity  will be conducted by [CONTACT_497542]: Mark T. Gladwin, MD  
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
[ADDRESS_639841]’s mouth and nose dur ing the exercise for gas exchange assessments of VO2, 
VE/VCO2 slope, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] (RER) will be measured as well as 
hemodynamics (max heart rate [HR] and blood pressure [BP]), time, and ECG waveforms). Any 
unexpected abnormalities will be reported to a patient’s cardiologist or primary care physician; 
continued participation in the study will require physician clearance. Both the Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and the Modified Borg Scale for Perceived Dyspnea (Shortness of 
Breath) will be completed during the CPX. The EMRC has performed similar tests in more than 1,000 volunteers ranging from elderly women in their 80’s to highly trained athletes.  
  
● Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB): a brief performance battery is used to assess how 
well older persons perform simple movements that represent the building blocks of daily activities that require good lower extremity function. It is based on timed 4 meter walk, repeated chair 
stands, and a set of balance tests.  
 
● Fatigability w ill be assessed based on rate of perceived exertion (RPE 6- 20 scale) reported 
after a steady state walking on a treadmill. Patents will walk 1.5 miles/hour (0.67 m/sec) for 5 minutes on a treadmill as per techniques validated by [CONTACT_497543], et al. (J Am Geriatr Soc. 
2014;62:347 -51). Those with RPE ≥10 will be categorized as highly fatigued. Our prior work in 
HF patients indicates this steady state walking provocation is feasible for the patients we 
anticipate we will enroll, and that it will (appropriately) generate a wide range of perceived 
fatigability responses for meaningful analyses of underlying mechanisms.  Aerobic capacity will be 
assessed with gas-exchange (as noted above) during the steady state walk  for VO2, VE/VCO2 
slope, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] (RER) .  
 
● Hand Grip Strength Assessment will be performed to measure muscle strength.  Participants  
will be asked to sit in a chair without arms and squeeze a device as hard as they can with one hand at a time, rest and switch to the other hand.  
 
● The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire will be used to measure disease-specific health- related quality of life (QOL). This 23-item instrument produces the following scores: 
Physical Limitation, Symptoms, Symptom Stability, Social Limitation, Self -efficacy, Quality of Life, 
and two summary measures, and is widely used as a standard by [CONTACT_497544], self -
efficacy, and oth er personal perspectives related to functional capacity at baseline and over time.  
Subjects in the healthy elderly control group without HF will be asked to complete the SF -12 which 
is a practical, reliable and valid measure of physical health. 
 ● 24-hour dietary recall. The study coordinator will collect a 24 -recall of all foods eaten the day 
before from subjects for analysis for calories, macronutrients, sodium, nitrates and nitrites.  
 
Visit 3 (Second Baseline Assessment Visit)  
 
This visit involves a percutaneous muscle biopsy, blood draw, first dose of study medication and 
dispensing of study medication. To prevent acute effects of exercise on muscle mitochondria function, this fasting visit will occur [ADDRESS_639842]  [15% of 30 
calories/kg  current body weight (CBW)  and 15% of 1.0 gm protein/kg CBW , low nitrite/nitrate ] in

standardized diet prescription.   
Interval history and brief physical exam: temperature, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, breathing 
rate, heart rate and body weight . Blood pressures may be re- measured to allow for clinical 
variation. Prior to the biopsy, study staff will call indicated subjects to hold their anti-platelet and 
anti-coag ulation  medications for 1 -5 days (depending on the different  medications  and relative 
half-lives). In each instance a subject is on an anti -platelet or anti -coagulation medication, the 
plan to hold the medication prior to the biopsy will first be cleared by [CONTACT_497545]’s own primary care provider  or cardiologist. Physician orders for CTRC will include 
confirmation with subject upon arrival.  
 • Blood sampling via IV line  to include:  research blood for inflammatory peptides (IL -1, IL-6, IL-
15, TNFα), platelet sample and nitrite levels . Blood samples will be drawn into a 1) heparinized 
syringe (baseline and approximately [ADDRESS_639844] study drug administration) and 2) 
a cell preparation tube (CPT) (baseline and approximately [ADDRESS_639845] study drug 
administration). Heparinized blood will be immediately centrifuged at bedside to separate plasma 
and the plasma and red cells separately flash frozen for later nitrite measurements (via reductive chemiluminescence to det ermine that nitrite levels were increased in the muscle as described. 
The second tube of blood (CPT tube) will be immediately subjected to differential centrifugation in order to isolate platelets. Platelets will then be subjected to Seahorse extracellular  flux analysis

inflammatory peptides.  Total volume of blood drawn will be 88 ml (6 tablespoons) . 
 • Skeletal Muscle Biopsies:  Patients will lie comfortably in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_497503]- dominant  leg. Biopsy sites will be prepped with betadine. 2% 
xylocaine (without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) will then be administered, superficially initially and then more deeply into the muscle, using a small gauge needle. Subjects who have report a history  of poor 
pain control or low threshold will be offered the use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_497504]. Ultrasound may be used to enhance visualization of the site for the needle insertion . A 
small superficial incision will next be completed using a #11 blade scalpel. A 5 mm Bergstrom 
muscle biopsy needle will be inserted through the skin incision and advanced into the muscle. 
Suction will be generated using a syringe attached to the outside portion of the needle, to thereby 
[CONTACT_497546] a hole on the side of the needle positioned in the muscle tissue; this 
draws a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_497505] (about 150 mg of muscle tissue) into the hollow shaft of the needle, which is then cut with a cutting trochar that slides through the shaft to cut the tissue drawn 
within its core. After harvesting the first sample, the needle will be rotated 90 degrees, and a 
second sample extracted to maximize yield for analysis. Additional passes of the needle may be 
necessary for an adequate muscle sample.  The wound site will be closed with steri -strips and a 
sterile pressure bandage. Muscle specimens will be immediately processed, and stored. One fragment will be placed in sterile cryotubes containing RNA preservation solution (RNAlater) and 
immediately fr ozen in liquid nitrogen for measurement of mRNA expression. A second fragment 
will have the muscle fibers aligned for microscopy, placed in OCT, then cooled in a thawing 
isopentane slurry and placed in a cryotube and frozen in liquid nitrogen for morpholog ical analysis. 
One specimen will immediately be used for high resolution respi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. Briefly, muscle fibers will be dissected and immediately placed in an Oroboros respi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. Basal respi[INVESTIGATOR_497506] A to assess non -

[ADDRESS_639853] - nitrites will include:  
1. Skeletal muscle bioenergetics: Mitochondrial function will be assessed using 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess pertinent gene expression (ubiquitin [MuRF, Atrogin1, FoxO], FNDC5, PGC1α, Sirtuin 3).   
2. Serology: plasma BNP, inflammatory  markers, plasma nitrite and platelet bioenergetics 
(using Seahorse XF analysis) (40), i.e., including glycolytic as well as basal and maximal 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_109651].   
3. Measures of physical function will include CPX indices, gait speed, strength (endurance, 
power), and balance.   
4. Quality of life: Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. 
  2.5 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Sample Size Justification: We believe our proposed sample size is adequate for successfully 
addressing the aims of this initial investigation. Numerous published pi[INVESTIGATOR_497511] (47,  48). Our prior data 
indicate between- subject standard deviation of approximately 32 pmol O
2/min/106 cells in platelet 
mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_497512] (49).  Based on this 
estimate, with the proposed sample sizes, we will be able to detect statistical significance of a within -group change as small as 32 pmol O
2/min/106 cells, and a between- group difference as 
small as 42 pmol O 2/min/106 cells with 80% statistical power in two- tailed tests conducted at 
α=0.05.  These correspond to large effect sizes by [CONTACT_30822]’s d criteria (50), and thus afford an 
adequate level of statistical sensitivity in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] i nvestigation.  
Data Analysis : Our analytic strategy will involve formal statistical analyses, but in our 
interpretation, we will also pay attention to descriptive statistics, graphical summarizations of 
individual participant data such as needle plots (51,52), and magnitudes of parameter estimates 
from modeling in addition to their statistical significance based on p-values and a strict criterion 
based on α=0.05.  Such an interpretive strategy is appropriate in an initial study such as ours, where the cost of a missed finding is far greater than a false finding.  We will fit a series of linear mixed models using the SAS
® MIXED procedure (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) with 
each of the skeletal muscle, platelet, gene expression, inflammatory, oxygen uptake and physical function related measures as the dependent variable; participant group (HFrEF/HFpEF/control), 
time point (baseline/4- week ) and their interaction as fixed effects of interest; and a participant 
random effect to account for multiple measurements from the same participants.  We will 
appropriately create means contrasts to estimate (a) between time changes in each of the groups 
corresponding to periods of usual care and nitrite usage, and (b) compare the said changes 
across the three groups.  We will use Pearson/Spearman correlations to quantify strength of 
associations between changes in measures of skeletal physiology and those of strength, gait 
speed and balance.  Finally, in addition to drawing preliminary conclusions, we will use our 
descriptive statistics for formal sample size computations in planning a larger subsequent trial to 
more definitively examine the impact of nitri tes.

 emergency treatment of cyanide poisoning31,32. It is also notable that neutrapharmaceutical 
preparations are currently being sold with levels of nitrite (12.7 mg per tablet) and nitrate (3.9 mg 
per tablet).  
   
Nitrite:  
Sodium nitrite has been used commercially as a food preserv ative, an anti -corrosive agent, a 
coloring agent, and an anti -anginal agent, with additional uses in laxatives, burn ointments, and 
liniments. Amyl nitrite has been inhaled or ingested as an euphoric stimulant.  Nitrite has also 
been found as a contaminant  in well water. Literature searches generated case reports of nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, flushing, cyanosis, tachypnea, dyspnea, 
hypotension and death attributed to excess nitrite (high -dose) exposure from these sources as a 
consequence of methemoglobinemia due to oxidation of heme -iron in oxyhemoglobin. Normal 
background methemoglobin production is 1- 3%. If levels of methemoglobin rise above 
approximately 30% of total hemoglobin, a subject may appear cyanotic and experience dyspnea, due to the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin (methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen). 
Levels above 50% can cause seizures, hypotension, coma and death. Sodium nitrite 
administration for cyanide poisoning at the labeled dosage of [ADDRESS_639861] never risen higher than 3% at  the currently used 
therapeutic doses (<75 mg) in [ADDRESS_639862]. Gladwin, has previously held an IND for sodium nitrite (IND # 70,411) for cardiovascular applications and currently has an approved IND for the use of 
sodium nitrite for lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (IND # 111,643). The cardiovascular IND involved the 
administration of sodium nitrite to 69 normal volunteers in 4 phase I -II clinical trials without 
observed adverse effects. He has also treated 11 subjects with sickle cell disease on this IND without observed adverse effects. The lower doses of nitrite used in these investigational 
treatment regimens – 60-120 mg daily or 20- 40% of the dose (300 mg) used in the emergency 
treatment of cyanide poisoning – do not produce methemoglobin levels greater than 3% and have 
not been associated with clinically significant hypotension. There have been no adverse events 
noted in the 80 treated normal human volunteers and patients with sickle cell disease disease
33-
35. In another study by [CONTACT_380992]., 18 healthy adults received an infusion of sodium nitrite  
totaling 75 mg (15 minutes each x 2 infusions). This was associated with a 7 mmHg decrease in mean arterial pressure, a peak methemoglobin of less 3% and no other significant effects
34. Note 
this single dose is 1.[ADDRESS_639863] crossover study, 9 healthy adult subjects received two single high 
dose or al sodium nitrite aqueous solutions  (0.12 and 0.06 mmol NaNo 2/mmol Hb, equivalent to 
290-380 mg and 140- 190 mg sodium nitrite, respectively, depending on the total body hemoglobin 
level of the person) and one intravenous sodium nitrite dose (0.12 mmol NaNo 2/mmol Hb)18. Note 
that this is 1.2-3.[ADDRESS_639864] 7 days between each of the treatments. Mild headache occurred in 44- 55% of subjects 
and was the most frequent complaint during each treatment session, which the authors ascribed 
to the sodium nitrite, not methemoglobinemia, as the percentage of methemoglobinemia stayed 
below clinically toxic levels (<15%). By [CONTACT_377972], up to 22% experienced nausea, which subsided 
within half an hou r18. The pharmacokinetic analysis of this study indicated similar bioavailability 
of oral and IV delivery of nitrite, as well as similar side effect and safety profiles.

 A recent study determined the safety and feasibility of prolonged intravenous nitrite  infusion . 
Twelve adult volunteers received increasing starting doses of sodium nitrite, 4.2 to 533.8 μg/kg/hr 
for 48 hours. Dose limiting toxicity occurred at 445.7 μg/kg/hr (10.6 mg/kg/day) and was limited 
to asymptomatic transient decreases of arterial blood pressure of up to 20 mmHg and 
asymptomatic increases of methemoglobin levels above 5%. No tolerance or clinically significant rebound was observed
36. Note this is 8.2 times the daily dose we plan to use in this trial (based 
on an adult body weight of  95 kg).  
 
For nitrite, two retrospective case- control studies have shown that high maternal dietary nitrite 
intake from cured meat or drinking water during pregnancy might be associated with risk of 
childhood brain tumors and possibly gastric and esophageal cancer. This evidence is only based 
on retrospective case -control studies; cohort studies have found no significantly increased risks24. 
 In the 2001 National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report summarizing 2- year rodent drinking water 
studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity  of sodium nitrite in male or female F344/N 
rats exposed to up to 130 mg/kg/day in males and 150 mg/kg/day in females, or in male B6C3F1 
mice exposed to up to 220 mg/kg/day. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic  activity of 
sodium nitrite in the highest dose of 165 mg/kg/day in female B6C3F1 mice based on the positive 
trend in the incidences of squamous cell papi[INVESTIGATOR_380953] (combined) of the forestomach. 
Exposure to sodium nitrite in drinking water resulted in increased incidences of epi[INVESTIGATOR_497515]. However, no chromosomal damage (genetic toxicity) was 
observed in three studies conducted in rats and mice in vivo
37. Taken together, these findings 
suggest minimal carcinogenic nitrite -mediated risk. 
 In the current study, we will use much lower doses of nitrite than used safely in any of thes e 
studies. Our nitrite dose of 20-40 mg three times daily is lower than the dose used on the 
cardiovascular IND and <40% of the dose for cyanide poisoning.   
 
Nine of [ADDRESS_639865] tolerated 40 mg po tid without 
incident; the one exception was a subject who had a decrease in systolic BP at pK but was 
asymptomatic. In the three heart failure subjects enrolled to date we have observed a vasoactive 
response at the pK with the [ADDRESS_639866] a greater 
vasodilatory response to nitrite and could require a stratified dose based on age and baseline risk for hypotension. To further ameliorate risk, we will serve a standardized meal prior to drug dosing 
at Visit 3 so that lack of po intake is not a causative factor of hypotension.

5.1.2 Risk of Study Procedures 
 
The collection of the research data from history and physical examination such as body weight, height and vital signs carries minimal risk. Phlebotomy or intravenous blood sampli ng risks of 
bruising, infection, anemia and fainting are common.  
 
The risks o f percutaneous muscle biopsy are bleeding and infection (both rare), bruising 
(infrequent) and discomfort (likely). With the use of a local anesthetic, our subjects describe the discomfort of muscle biopsy as about twice that of intravenous cannulation. Some residual 
stiffness in the vastus lateralis can persist for 1- 2 days (common). An elastic wrap and ice bag 
are applied post -biopsy to decrease the risk of bruising and for an anesthetic effect. In our 
experience using similar protocols, subjects have not  experienced any adverse effects from these 
procedures other than a small amount of residual localized soreness at the biopsy site. Additional 
risk includes any unusual reaction to the elastic bandage wrap and ice, i.e. leg numbness which 
would indicate the elastic bandage had been applied too tightly or the ice left on too long; or any skin redness, irritation, and chafing from the applied steri- strips.   
 Use of anesthetic cream  
There is a risk of reaction to the anesthetic cream (lidocaine and prilocaine). The use of anesthetic 
cream has a risk of methemoglobinemia when used with larger areas or times, or on certain meds 
including subjects taking nitrites . To prevent adverse reactions, the cream will only be used in 
subjects with a history of poor pain control. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_497516]/benefit of use. In subjects who 
require it, use will be limited to no more than 2 applications of 2.5 grams as per package instructions, approximately 5- 6 weeks apart to an area 2- 4 cm on the thigh. The cream will be 
applied, and then biopsy will not proceed for an hour. Initial nitrite drug dosing occurs a minimum 
of 30 minutes after the biopsy. The subjects are then monitored for % methemoglobinemia for [ADDRESS_639867] medication profiles, using the minimal required amount of the cream, spacing with drug dosing, and monitoring of methem% of subjects allows for safe use in those 
subjects for which it is indicated.  
  
Risk of holding blood thinners, anti- clotting or anti -inflammatory medications  
There is a risk of increased pain if the anti -inflammatory medication is taken for arthritis or other 
pain related diagnosis. There is a risk of cardiac event if the medicati on is taken for anti -clotting 
prophylaxis related to cardiovascular disease. The risk is managed by [CONTACT_497558]: Mark T. Gladwin, MD  
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
[ADDRESS_639868] (VO2max) and subsequent exercise training sessions may cause muscle 
soreness or fatigue, but in adults without a known history of heart disease,  the risk of heart attack 
or death from maximal or sub- maximal exercise bouts is rare. The relative risk of exercise testing 
for obese adults has not been clearly defined. However, a survey of more than 2,000 clinical 
exercise testing laboratories, in which more than 600,000 tests were performed, showed a death rate of approximately 0.5 per 10,000.   
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria will be used to halt exercise testing. In 
addition to ACSM criteria, the exercise test will be stopped if t he subject has either signs or 
symptoms of cardiovascular compensation, e.g. hypotensive response to exerci se. These  
exercise tests will be interpreted by a physician at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589]. 
The staff conducting maximal exercise tests are ACLS certified. The Exercise Physiology 
Laboratory has a crash cart with emergency equipment (including a defibrillator -monitor, airway 
equipment, IV sets and fluids, syringes, needles, Lidocaine, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], Nitroglycerine, etc.) and 
will be prese nt during maximal exercise testing.  
 Heart rate monitoring may result in s kin chafing or irritation from the EKG electrodes used 
during ex ercise testing.  
 The l ocal anesthesia (buffered lidocaine) used for muscle biopsy may cause an anaphylactic 
reaction to 2% which could result in a severe allergic reaction that may be simple or severe 
enough to cause shortness of breath, swelling of the throat, inflammation of the skin, hypotension 
and death. 
 
 
 
Echocardiograms present no direct risks, but subjects will need to remain quietly at supi[INVESTIGATOR_497517] a small plastic probe is placed against their chest. A gel is also applied to increase transmission 
of sound waves for optimal imaging quality. In rare instances, some people may find this to be 
anxiety producing. [CONTACT_497575], who has advanced training in echocardiography , will oversee 
trained study staff performing echocardiograms to assure these are reliably completed with a 
minimum of patient distress.  Likewise the ultrasound which may be used to guide the muscle 
biopsy carries no direct risk  and may improve experience for subject . 
 Patients will answer questionnaires as part of the study assessments, i.e. , requiring responses 
about daily activities and quality of life which in some cases may be a source of emotional distress. 
Efforts will be made to keep the environment and support by [CONTACT_497559].  
 There are no health risks of fasting for [ADDRESS_639869] is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497518].   There is 
a potential of developi[INVESTIGATOR_89994] (viral or bacterial) while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497519]. We will try to not pair participants to share a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497520] a sick patient.

2. External Adverse Events  that are (i) Unexpected; (ii)  Related to the Research Intervention 
and (iii) Serious or otherwise suggests that the research places subjects or others at 
greater risk than was previously recognized 
 
Any event meeting #1 or #2 above will be reported immediately to the IRB in their required format . 
In the event that a participant either withdraws from the study or the PIs decide to discontinue a participant due to a SAE, the participant will be monitored by [CONTACT_22888] -PIs until (a) a resol ution is 
reached (e.g., the problem has resolved or stabilized with no further change expected), (b) the 
SAE is determined to be clearly unrelated to the study intervention, or (c) the SAE results in death. 
Outcomes of SAEs will be regularly reported to the IRB. A summary of the SAEs that occurred 
during the previous year will be included in the annual progress report as well as in the annual 
IRB renewal. Suicidal ideation and AEs will be formally assessed immediately after treatment and 
referrals for furth er care will be made as needed. In the Informed Consent Form, we will provide 
specific information about emergency contacts. Participants are instructed to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Forman 
during working hours. After hours participants will be provided the information on how to contact 
[CONTACT_497562].  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]: 
For safety reasons, we propose to discontinue participation for any subject who experiences any 
of the following:  
1. Methemoglobin greater than 5%  after dose lowering  
A nitrite dose reduction is proposed from 40 mg three times daily to 20 mg three times 
daily if this methemoglobin % is reached at any study  interim  visit, as described in 
section 2.2.6  (phone report of change in skin tone and dizziness  or other symptom 
suggestive of methemoglobinemia) . Follow up symptom assessment for 48 hours and 
repeat methemoglobin in 3 days will be implemented.  If methemoglobin is greater than 
5% on the lower nitrite dose, participation in the study for the subject will be discontinued.  
 
2. Blood pressure drop  after dose lowering  
Blood pressure and related symptoms .  
 
If subjects  experience lightheadedness or dizziness after visit [ADDRESS_639871] that they call the study coordinator who will inventory their symptoms, 
compare to baseline (measured at pK) levels, and discuss need for interim visi t with 
study physician. If a visit is indicated, we will measure blood pressure, RR, heart  
rate, and check methemoglobin level by a finger probe. A study physician will evaluate 
each subject,  including: 
a. review  of all clinical measures ,  
b. subject history  of symptoms,

[ADDRESS_639872] s will continue with the half dose.   However if there are 
continued symptoms on lower doses, the physician investigator will reevaluate the 
patient’s suitability for continued participation based on symptoms and/or 
hemodynamics.   
If subjects initiated at Visit 3 on the 20 mg dose report symptoms as described above, 
the same process will be followed;  however, the physician may have to withdraw the 
subject since a dose lower than [ADDRESS_639873] biopsy at Visit 3 may refuse a second pass. (Participants may also 
refuse a second biopsy pass at Visit 5). However, participants who refuse to complete a 
second biopsy at Visit 5 (prior to starting sodium nitrite) will be withdrawn from the study. 
Alternatively, patients who refuse the 2nd biopsy after they have completed the 4 weeks 
of nitrite therapy will still be included.  
 
4. Medication compliance  
In the event that the medication compliance rate is <80%, subjects will be re -educated 
on medication compliance. If medication compliance repeatedly falls outside of the acceptable range, the study investigators will discuss subject eligibility for continued 
participation in the study . 
 
 5.4.3 Parameters to be monitored  
The following progress will be monitored throughout the course of the research to ensure the 
safety of subjects as well as the integrity and confidentiality of their data.  
 
• An evaluation of the progress of the research study, including subject recruitment and retention, and an assessment of the timeliness and quality of the data.  
 
• A review of collected data (including adverse events, unanticipated problems, and 
subject withdrawals) to determine whether there is a change to the anticipated 
benefit -to-risk assessment of study participation and whether the study should 
continue as originally designed, should be changed, or should be terminated.  
 
• An assessment of external factors or relevant information (e. g., pertinent scientific 
literature reports or therapeutic development, results of related studies) that may 
have an impact on the safety and study participants or the ethics of the research 
study.  
 
• A review of study procedures designed to protect the privacy of the research subjects 
and the confidentiality of their research data. 
 The severity of adverse changes in physical signs or symptoms will be classified as follows:  
 
Oral Nitrite for Older Heart Failure Patients  Sponsor: Mark T. Gladwin, MD

33 
 • Grade 1 (Mild) : asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation only; 
intervention not indicated.  
 
• Grade 2 (Moderate) : minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; lim iting age -
appropriate ADL (Activities of Daily Living).  
 
• Grade 3 (Severe): medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self care 
ADL.  
 
• Grade 4 (Life- threateni ng): consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
 
• Grade 5 (Death) : event is a direct cause of death.  
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_639874] clinical event that is  thought by [CONTACT_381000] -related, that is also:  
 1. Fatal or immediately life threatening 
2. Permanently disabling, or severely incapacitating. 3. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
4. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312753], based upon appropriate  
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient, or subject, and may require medical, or 
surgical intervention to prevent  one of the serious outcomes listed above.  
 
If clinically important and unexpected adverse experiences, or clinically important study -related 
adverse experiences occur, they will be recorded on the adverse event case report form.    
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_639875] be notified by [CONTACT_497563] a human adverse event that 
is fatal or life -threatening no later than 7 calendar days after receiving the respective human 
adverse event information, followed by [CONTACT_497564] a written IND Safety Report.

accordance with the respective policies and procedures of the IRB.  Written IND Safety Reports 
will be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 15 calendar days following the investigator -sponsor’s receipt of the respective adverse event information.  
 
A summary report of the findings will be prepared and submitted to the regulatory agencies. 
 5.[ADDRESS_639877] Risks  
General Risks of Study Protocol and Procedures  
All research interventions/activities will be conducted in private patient care areas. The collection of sensitive information about subjects is limited to the amount necessary to achieve the aims of 
the research, so that no unneeded sensitive information is being collected.  
 
All demographic and clinical information about the subject will be stored on an electronic 
password- guarded study database under the supervision of the Investigator for this protocol. The 
electronic database that is being used for the purpose of this study has not been fully validated to be in compliance with the FDA regulations at 21 CFR Part 11; i.e. taking into account the limited 
scope of this clinical investigation. The data will be stripped of individual identifiers and stored anonymously with a subject  number. Information linking subject identifiers with the coded subject 
number will be stored under password protection on computers in locked areas, with access only to the database manager. Maintaining records in locked files in locked offices will protect 
confidentiality of subjects. All staff will sign confidentiality statements. Access to the database will 
be limited to the data manager and staff under the supervision of the Investigator.  
 
Specimens will be stripped of subject identifiers and stored according to a similar coding protocol as described above. These specimens will be stored safely in the custody of the Investigator 
responsible for the individual assays. The Investigators will limit future access to any remaining 
sample to only those investigators with prior IRB approval for their studies.  
 
All staff involved in this study are properly credentialed and instructed in the areas of testing, confidentiality, and safety.  
 
The Investigator will retain the data for the entire period of this study.  The Investigator may 
continue to use and disclose subjects’ de- identified information for the purpose of this study for a 
minimum of seven years after final reporting or publication of the study. If the subject and/or legal representative decide to withdraw or be withdrawn from study participation, they may request that 
the study data and samples be destroyed.

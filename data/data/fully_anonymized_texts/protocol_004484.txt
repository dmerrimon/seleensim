 “Protocol Amendment: New Protocol”: IND 116,208 KMgCit Powder  
IRB Study #: ---; August 31, 2015 [ F]  
 
Study Protocol  
7.1. Title of Project : Amelioration of Chlorthalidone -Induced Hy pokalemia and 
Metabolic Disturbances  by [CONTACT_496624] -Magnesium Citrate (KMgCit) Powder  
Principal Investigator : [INVESTIGATOR_496613], M.D., Hypertension Section, 
Division of Cardiology , Department of Internal Medicine, University of [LOCATION_007] 
Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW)  
Co-Investigator : Orson W. Moe, M.D., Center for Mineral Me tabolism and Clinical 
Research, UTSW  
 In a just completed study ( IND 116,208; IRB Study #: STU 072012 -001), 
potassium magnesium citrate ( KMgCit) powder did not alter blood pressure in 
patients with pre- and Stage I hypertension, while potassium chloride (KCl) 
powder lowered it. However, KMgCit powder reduced urinary 8-isoprostane  
serum FGF23. Chlorthalidone  (CTD) , a thiazide diuretic widely used for 
treatment of  hypertension, produces certain metabolic disturbances associated 
with Type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome.  In this “protocol amendment: new 
protocol”, t hese circumstance s led us to explore  whether KMgCit powder co-
administered with CTD would correct hypokalemia, and ameliorate metabolic 
disturbances of CTD therapy among patients with Stage I  hypertension. We shall 
examine  the effect of CTD alo ne, CTD with K MgCit powder or CTD with KCl 
powder in a parallel design.  
1. Specific Aims : 
  
Aim 1. To compare the effect of KMgCit powder and KCl powder on correction or 
prevention of CTD -induced hypokalemia.  
Aim 2. To examine CTD-induced changes in r enin-angiotensin aldosterone (RAA)  
system, oxidative stress, and insulin sensitivity between KMgCit powder and KCl  
powder supplementation.  
Aim 3. To evaluate hepatic fat accumulation by [CONTACT_38692].  
Aim 4. To compare the Mg status from measurement of muscle Mg by [CONTACT_496625] + KMgCit powder and CTD + KCl powder.  
 It is expected that : (a) KMgCit powder would be equally effective in 
correcting /preventing CTD -induced hypokalemia as KCl powder, without 
incurring hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. (b) Compared to KCl powder plus 
CTD, KMgCit powder added to CTD would reveal lower serum aldo sterone, 
urinary isoprostanes, serum glucose, and HOMA -IR and serum FGF23. (c) 
Hepatic fat content would increase on CTD plus KCl powder, but would decline 
on CTD + KMgCit powder. (d) Muscle Mg would increase on KMgCit powder + 
2 
 CTD, but would be decreased on KCl powder + CTD. It is hypothesized that CTD 
produces v arious metabolic disturbances that interact with each other or act 
independently to alter the propensity for Type II diabetes and metabolic 
syndrome, and that KMgCit powder ameliorates these distur bances  or 
propensity. This protocol will put a special focus on testing a scheme  that links 
Mg depletion from CTD to hepatic fat accumulation and insulin resistance.   
2. Background : 
  The idea for this study came from a just completed trial ( IND 116,208 
KMgCit Powder; IRB #STU 072012 -001). We examined whether KMgCit  powder 
could lower blood pressure in patients with pre - and Stage I hypertension, by 
[CONTACT_496626] “DASH” diet (potassium, magnesium and 
alkali)  that have been shown to lower blood pressure  (Sacks, 2001). KMgCit 
powder was compared with potassium citrate ( KCit) powder, KCl powder and 
placebo. KMgCit  powder was shown to be ineffective in lowering blood pressure.   
 However, the above study disclosed that K MgCit  powder might have other 
useful ness, since it seemed to ameliorate  some of the metabolic disturbances 
associated with CTD .  
Metabolic disturbances of CTD  
 CTD is a thiazide (TZ) type diuretic advocated by [CONTACT_496627] (NICE 2011) , owing to its longer half -life and greater 
antihypertensive efficacy at the clinically recommended doses than other 
thiazide diuretics (Vongpatanasin, 2015). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_496614], CTD and other TZ diuretics are known to cause various 
metabolic  disturbances , such as hypokalemia, activation of renin -angiotensin 
system  and sympathetic nervous system  (RAA-SNS) (Menon, 2009) , oxidative 
stress  (Ribeiro, 2013; Reungjui, 2007 ), dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]  (Eriksson, 2008; Price, 
2013), increased FGF23 synthesis (Pathare, 2012), insulin resistance  (Xie, 2005; 
Price, 2013 ; Raheja, 2012; Menon, 2009 ), and Mg depletion  (Sheehan, 1982 ; 
Hollifield, 1987 ).   
Mechanism for various metabolic disturbances of CTD/TZ ultimately 
contributing to the development of typ e II diabetes and metabolic syndrome are 
unknown. The traditional explanation implicating hypokalemia has been 
questioned.  
  CTD/ TZ-induced potassium depletion and hypokalemia are thought to be 
the main cause of hyperglycemia by [CONTACT_496628] . However, serum 
insulin increases rather than decreases with TZ diuretics (Carter 2008, Raheja 
2012) . The m aintenance of normokalemia during CTD administration by K 
supplementation failed to prev ent CTD -induced increase in fasting plasma 
glucose and HOMA -IR, an index of insulin resistance  (Raheja, 2012; Menon, 
2009) . CTD is known to induce a sustained activation of RAA-SNS in 
3 
 hypertensive patients (Menon 2009, Raheja 2012). This n eurohormonal 
activation is independent of serum potassium  as it is unaffected by K 
supplementation  (Menon 2009, Raheja 2012) . Thiazide diuretic has been shown 
to increase renal oxidative stress, which cannot be accounted for by [CONTACT_496629] (Reungjui , 2007).  
  Various metabolic disturbances of CTD/TZ might be pathogenetically 
linked, involving a pathway independent of hypokalemia. Some metabolic 
disturbance might directly cause insulin resistance and Type II diabetes. Other 
factors mig ht do so indirectly  by [CONTACT_496630] .  
Activation of RAA system has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
insulin resistance by [CONTACT_496631]  (Wada, 2009; Hitomi, 2007) , resulting in impaired insulin 
mediated glucose uptake  (Luther, 2011; Selvaraj, 2009 ). The deleterious effect of 
RAA system a ctivation is mediated at least in part by [CONTACT_496632] 
(Sowers, 2009).  Activation of the SNS system may further promote insulin 
resistance by [CONTACT_496633] -dependent 
(Jamerson, 1993; Sartori, 1999)  and flow -independent (Lembo, 1994; 
Navegantes, 2003)  mechanisms . 
  Mg depletion from CTD/TZ may cause renal potassium loss and refractory 
hypokalemia (Whang, 1977). Magnesium supplementation alone without 
potassium ameliorate d TZ-induced hypokalemia (Ruml, 1999). Activation of RAA 
system by [CONTACT_496634]. Inverse correlation between 
plasma renin activity and serum Mg has been demonstrated in a cross sectional 
study of patients with untreated essential hypertension (Resnick, 1983). In 
norm al volunteers, serum aldosterone at baseline and after angiotensin II 
infusion was significantly higher on Mg -deficient diet than on Mg -replete diet 
(Nadler, 1993). Co-infusion of Mg with angiotensin II attenuated the rise in 
serum aldosterone, suggesting direct inhibitory effect of Mg on the RAA system.  
KMgCit powder as a c ountermeasure  for metabolic disturbances of CTD  
Effective strategy in preventing th e metabolic disturbances o f CTD /TZ has 
not been fully developed.  
  KCl supplementation is ineffective. Correction of hypokalemia by [CONTACT_496635] -induced fasting hyperglycemia and increased HOMA -IR (Raheja, 
2012; Menon, 2009). CTD -induced activation of RAA-SNS was unaffected by [CONTACT_496636]  (Menon 2009, Raheja 2012).  In TZ -treated patients with 
hypertension, KCl supplementation did not  reduce serum aldosterone (Kaplan, 
1985 ).  
  KMgCit powder possess es distinct properties apart from KCl powder in 
overcoming deleterious metabolic disturbances of CTD therapy . Considerable 
data on  physiological -clinical action of this drug ha ve been obtained by [CONTACT_11384]  
4 
 investigative  group using a tablet formulation (under IND  32,284 & 36,276; NDA 
20-964), as summarized below .     
 
Physiological properties of KMgCit . This preparation was shown to confer 
equivalent potassium bioavailability as potassium chloride, similar magnesium 
bioavailability as magnesium citrate, and greater alkali load than potassium 
citrate  (Koenig, 1991) . In patients with calcium nephrolithiasis , KMgCit 
significantly increas ed urinary pH and citrate compared to placebo . It was more 
effective than potassium citrate in  inhibiting the crystallization of uric acid and 
calcium oxalate in urine  (Pak, 1992) . 
  Some of the orally administered citrate may appear in urine by [CONTACT_496637][INVESTIGATOR_496615] . Serum citrate concentration increased significantly 
within 30 minutes after a single oral dose of citric acid and remained significantly 
elevated for 3 hours after citric acid load. Commensurate with this change, 
urinary citrate  excretion peaked at 2 hours and gradually decreased during the 
next 2 hours after a citric acid load  (Sakhaee, 1992 ).  
  KMgCit was equally effective as potassium chloride in correcting HCTZ -
induced hypokalemia. In addition, KMgCit, but not KCl, produce d a small but 
significant increase in serum magnesium concentration by [CONTACT_26129] a 
magnesium load, and it confer red alkalinizing and citraturic actions (Pak, 2000) .  
  The above actions of KMgCit – potassium and magnesium load, citraturic 
action, and alkali  load – might have a role in mitigating metabolic disturbances 
of CTD , as discussed below.   
  Prevention of TZ-induced hypokalemia  by [CONTACT_496638] K and 
Mg load . In healthy subjects taking HCTZ , the addition of KMgCit 
correct ed/prevent ed hypokalemia (Ruml, 1999; Wuermser, 2000 ), without 
producing metabolic alkalosis (Odvina, 2006).  
  Potential i nhibition of RAA -SNS activation  by [CONTACT_496639] .  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_496616] d vasoconstriction during muscle contraction in 
spontaneously hypertensive rats. Normally, exercise triggers parallel increases 
in sympathetic nervous system to the resting and exercising skeletal muscle. In 
the resting muscle , sympathetic activation triggers alpha -adrenergic 
vasoconstriction, thereby [CONTACT_496640]. In the working muscles, sympathetic vasoconstriction is markedly 
blunted by [CONTACT_496641] , particularly  nitric oxide . This 
phenomenon, known as functional sympatholysis, is thought to be a protective 
mechanism to optimize blood flow to the working muscle ( Remensnyder JP, 
1962 ). Our study indicated that functional sympatholysis is impaired in 
hypertensive pa tients, which may contribute to exercise intolerance 
(Vongpatanasin 2011) . The impairment in  functional sympatholysis in 
5 
 
hypertension was shown to be  related to increased skeletal muscle oxidative 
stress  that inactivates NO  (Zhoa 2006) .  
In our study in spontaneously hypertensive rats, d ietary Mg 
supplementation blunt ed sympathetic mediated vasoconstriction  (A, right)  
compared with Mg deficient diet (A, left), and reduce d muscle oxidative stress 
both in contracting muscle and resting muscle (B)  (Fig. 1) .

to lumbar sympathetic nerve stimulation (1, 2.5, and 5 Hz) at rest (white bars) and 
during muscle contraction (grey bars) i n spontaneously hypertensive  rats (SHRs) treated 
with Mg deficient diet ( left, 30 mg/kg ) vs. high Mg diet (4.8 grams/kg, right)  for 12 weeks . 
Sympathetic mediated reduction in vascular conductance is attenuated in the SHRs  
treated with high Mg die t compared to Mg deficient diet,  B. Summary data showing 
increased oxidative stress as evidenced by [CONTACT_496642] (DHE/DAPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_39870]) in resting and contracting muscles of SHRs  treated with Mg deficient diet 
compared to high Mg diet.   
   Potential i nhibition  of oxidative stress  by [CONTACT_496643], alkali and magnesium. A high dose of citric acid (1 –2 g/kg) reduced 
brain lipid peroxidation and inflammation, liver damage, and DNA fragmentation 
in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide, s uggesting a protective role of citric acid 
in endotoxin -induced oxidative stress ( Abdel -Salam , 2014 ).  
Supporting an inhibitory role of alkali, a calcium/potassium salt of 
hydroxycitric acid (rich in alkali) extracted from the  dried fruit rind of the plant 
Garcinia cambogia  reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin 
resistance in obese Zucker rats ( Asghar , 2007 ). In the Dietary Approaches to 
Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD)  trial, a diet rich in alkali and magnesium  and 
low in sodium  was shown to reduce urinary F2 -isoprostanes  by 31%  in 
hypertensive patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction , 
suggesting decreased oxidative stress  (Hummel , 2012).  Consumption of black 
currant juice was shown to r educe plasma F2 -isoprostanes and improve 
endothelial function in individuals with habitually low dietary intake of fruits 
6 
 and vegetable s (Khan , 2014 ). Induction of metabolic acidosis with oral 
ammonium chloride  for 5 days in normal volunteers increased leu cine 
appearance from body protein  and led to leucine oxidation, suggesting increased 
protein degradation and amino acid oxidation ( Reaich , 1992 ). It can be inferred 
that alkali load by [CONTACT_496644].  
As evidence of its protective role, Mg was shown  to ameliorate creatine 
kinase -MB elevation , oxidative stress, lactate accumulation, and pyruvate 
reduction , as well as preserv e creatin ine phosphate, adenine nucleotides and 
Na(+),K(+) -ATPase activity , in mice with lipopolysaccharide -induced 
cardiotoxicit y (Ahmed , 2012 ). Dietary magnesium restriction increased 
ischemic/reperfusion injury in the isolated rat hearts. D ietary Mg deficiency was 
shown to  promote cardiomyopathy, in situ  cardiac dysfunction, and myocardial 
intolerance to secondary stresses . 
Significant protection against most of 
these Mg  deficiency -mediated events 
has been observed with interventions 
that modulate neuronal substance P 
release or its bioactivity, and with 
several antioxidants (vitamin E, 
probuco l, epi[INVESTIGATOR_496617], d-propranolol ) 
(Kramer , 2009 ). 
 We obtained the most direct 
evidence of KMgCit powder’s 
inhibition of oxidative stress in a just 
completed trial (original IND 
116,208). Thirty patients with pre - or 
Stage I hypertension underwent a 
crossover trial, whereby [CONTACT_496645] t powder, K Cit powder, KCl 
powder or placebo for 4 weeks. The 
potassium content during the K salt 
phases was 20 meq bid. In the KMgCit powder phase, patients also took 10 meq 
Mg bid. A spot urine sample was obtained at the end of 4 weeks of treatment of 
each phase. Urinary 8 -isoprostane was significantly lower during the KMgCit 
powder phase than during other phases (Fig. 2).  
  Potential a melioration of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_496618]. Mg 
supplementation with bittern, a natural MgCl 2 solution from sea or salt lake 
water, reduced the appearance in serum of lipid components after a fat load  in 
normal volunteers  (Kishimoto, 2010).  The concentration s of apo -B48, remnant -
like particle cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acid were signific antly lower at 2 
hours after the fat -with-Mg meal compa red with the fat -only meal .  Thus, Mg 
supplementation  by [CONTACT_496646][INVESTIGATOR_035] .

   In rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet (1% or 2%) , oral magnesium aspartate 
hydrochloride: (i) lower ed serum cholesterol and triglyceride in normal (25 -35%) 
as well as atherosclerotic (20 -40%) animals , and (ii) attenuate d the 
atherosclerotic process  markedly. In addition, dietary deficiency of Mg 
augment ed atherogenesis markedly and stimulate d (or activate d) macrophages 
in the reticuloendothelial system (Altura , 1990 ; Smith 2013 ). In rats, Mg 
deficient diet reduced post -heparin lipase activity and hepatic lipase, resulting 
in increased serum triglycerides and triglyceride content of chylomicrons, very 
low density lipoprotein s, low density lipoprotein s and high density lipoprotein s 
(Rayssiguier, 1991).   
  Potential s uppression of FGF23 synthesis  by [CONTACT_496647].  In mouse calvarial and o steoblast preparation s, a culture medium 
mimicking metabolic a lkalosis inhibited FGF23 protein and mRNA (Krieger, 
2012).  Mice exposed to Mg -deficient diet showed a marked increase in serum 
FGF23  (van Angelen, 2013).   
  Potential a melior ation of insulin resistance  and type II diabetes  by [CONTACT_496648]. In a randomized crossover study  in normal 
volunteers , Mg deficient diet reduce d insulin sensitivity (estimated from 
intravenous glucose tolerance test ), compared to Mg repleted diet  (Nadler 1993) . 
In a double -blind, placebo -controlled study in prediabetic subjects , KCit 
(delivering alkali load) but not KCl reduced insulin resistance as revealed by 
[CONTACT_14785] -IR (Conen , 2015 ). In a cross -sectional study, Type 2 diabetes mellitus was 
associated with lower urinary pH and higher net acid excretion, independent of 
age, body weight, creatinine clearance, and dietary factors (Cameron 2006). 
Several populational studies have shown an association between dietary acid 
load and insulin resistance as well as the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Akter 
2015 and Fagherazzi 2014). In the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Surveys involving healthy US population, low serum bicarbonate a nd high anion 
gap w ere independently associated with increased plasma fasting insulin and 
triglyceride, suggesting increased risk of insulin resistance (Farwell 2008).  These 
studies inferred potential protective action of KMgCit powder from alkali load.  
  Several studies suggested a protective role of Mg. In a case control study  
of 163 women and 131 men , hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium ≤1.8 mg/dL ) 
was independently associated with incident metabolic syndrome . Additional 
adjustment by [CONTACT_11084] C -reactive protein s howed that metabolic syndrome  
remained associated with hypomagnesemia (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 -5.9) but not 
with oxidative stress determined by [CONTACT_496649] (OR 
1.1; 95% CI 0.9 -5.9) (Guerrero -Romero , 2006 ). In a prospective obser vational 
study with median follow up of 16 years, high magnesium intake was a 
significant protective factor for the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, especially among 
subjects with insulin resistance, low -grade inflammation and a drinking habit 
(Hata, 2013).  
[ADDRESS_638535] on glucose metabolism by [CONTACT_496650]. Mg deficient rats displayed 45% reduction in the glucose -stimulated 
insulin secretion. Mg restriction produced defective tyrosine kinase activity of 
insulin receptors, leading to decreased phosphorylation of the beta -subunit of 
the insulin receptor  (Suarez, 1995).  
  Potential Mg 
repletion by [CONTACT_496651].  By 
[CONTACT_496652], 
KMgCit powder should 
prevent/ameliorate CTD -
induced hypomagnesemia 
or Mg depletion. In prior 
studies with a tablet 
formulation of KMgCit, 30 
healthy subjects 
developed 
hypomagnesemia (serum 
Mg < 1.8 mg/dL) on HCTZ  
50 mg/day al one for 2 -3 
weeks (Pak, 2000). When 
KMgCit was added to 
HCTZ treatment at a dose 
of 42 meq K and 21 meq 
Mg/day, serum Mg 
increas ed to the normal 
range (Fig. 3).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Among 131 subjects who took HCTZ, the percentage of subjects with 
hypomagnesemia progre ssively declined when KMgCit was added (Fig. 4, closed 
circles). However, the percentage of subjects with hypomagnesemia increased 
when KCl or potassium citrate was added to HCTZ treatment (open circles).   Fig. 3. Effect of KMgCit on serum Mg concentration

Summary  
  In summary, CTD may 
produce various metabolic disturbances, including hypokalemia, activation of 
RAA-SNS, oxidative stress, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], FGF23 synthesis, insulin resistance, 
and magnesium depletion (Fig. 5). These factors act solely or interact with each 
other to contribute to the development of Type II diabetes and metabolic 
syndrome. KMgCit powder can potentially overcome all of these metabolic 
disturbances. On the other hand, the action of KCl powder might  be limited to 
correction of hypokalemia.  
 
Fig. 5. Scheme for CTD -induced metabolic disturbances that could lead to Type II 
diabetes and metabolic syndrome. These disturbances might be blocked by [CONTACT_496653].   
A special focus of this protocol will be on the CTD -induced Mg depletion 
(Fig. 6). CTD is well known to cause Mg depletion, hepatic steatosis and Type II 
diabetes -metabolic syndrome. We speculate that Mg depletion is responsible for 
hepatic fat deposition,  which then produces insulin resistance. Co -
administration of KMgCit powder would avert Mg depletion, block hepatic fat 
deposition by [CONTACT_496654], 
thereby [CONTACT_496655]. To test this hyp othesis, we shall 
quantitate muscle Mg status and hepatic fat content by [CONTACT_38692].

3. Significance:  
 
  Thiazide typ e diuretics are widely used as a first line treatment of 
hypertension  in a very large number of subjects  (James 2014 , Vongpatanasin 
2014) . While this class of drugs is effective in lowering blood pressure, its use is 
complicated by  [CONTACT_496656], many of which are features of 
metabolic syndrome  induced or worsened by [CONTACT_323670] . Some of these metabolic 
complications already coexist with hypertension and their exacerbation by [CONTACT_496657]. KMgC it powder potentially represents a 
novel modality to not only prevent  CD/TZ-induced hypokalemia, but also inhibit 
or ameliorate metabolic disturbances.  This simple replacement of inorganic 
solutes can potentially allow CTD /TZ to exert its full antihyperten sive efficacy  
without the negative drawback of worsening metabolic syndrome counteracting 
the benefits of blood pressure control .  
4. Preliminary Data/Past Work : 
  This investigative group has already obtained preliminary data or 
published relevant work on all four aims of this pro posal . Using a tablet 
formulation of KMgCit, the group has delineated physiological action of this 
compound  in detail and some of its clin ical effects . Safety of usage was also 
shown. Some data to be shown below were derived from original IND with KMgCit 
powder  or in experimental animals .  
  Effect of CTD on inflammation . In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] i n 16 subjects with 
uncomplicated  stage I hypertension, s erum highly sensitive C -reactive protein 
(hsCRP ) rose significantly from 3.2 (1.0 – 4.6; 
median, 25th – 75th percentile) at baseline to 4.8 
(2.6 – 9.8) during CTD (p < 0.05)  (Fig. 7) .  In 
contrast, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407] (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]) had no effect on 
hsCRP levels in the same subject s.

50 mg/day with KCl tab 40 meq K/day. S erum triglyceride declined by -32  41

Study design  
 The patients will participate in a  three-phase study  in a parallel design 
(Fig. 9).  
 
 
  
  Fig. 9. Study scheme.   
  

13 
 After baseline evaluation (Phase 1 , without CTD) , patients will take CTD 
alone for 2 -3 weeks (Phase 2, CTD alone ). They will then be randomized  to two 
equal groups  to take K MgCit powder or KCl powder along with CTD for 4 months 
(Phase 3).  
Test drugs 
  KCl powder, made by [CONTACT_496658], will contain 20 meq K as potassium chloride per sachet. K MgCit 
powder, also made by [CONTACT_496659], will contain 20 meq K , 10 meq Mg, and 30 meq 
citrate, per sachet. These preparations will be prepared by [CONTACT_286802] , and 
their c omposition will be the same, as those used in the completed trial (original 
IND 116,208 ).   
The sachets of KCl and K MgCit powder will be identical in appearance. 
During Phase 3, patients will dissolve the content s of each sachet of KCl or 
KMgCit powder in [ADDRESS_638539] medications. Each sachet will be marked by a code, the identity of which 
will be known only to an independent study monitor. Each sachet will be labeled: 
Study drug # --; CTD-Induced Hypokalemia ; Investigator: W. Vongpatanasin, 
M.D.  
 Chlorthalidone, [ADDRESS_638540] been terminated. (Tracy 
Roberson, licensing officer of UTSW’ s Office of Technology Development, can be 
consulted for verification.) No relationship now exists between Althos Pharma 
and UTSW or investigators.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_496621], the investigators are convinced t hat 
the high scien tific merit of the proposal mandates its pursuit. T hus, this protocol 
is investigator -initiated and research -driven, and not industry -sponsored. The 
initial costs of the study will be borne by [CONTACT_496660]. 
CMMCR will purchase test me dications from Sterling Pharmaceutical Services.  
 
Outline of the study (Table 1) 
14 
  Baseline (Phase  1, time zero). At enrollment , various tests/procedures as 
outlined in Table 1 will be obtained. P atients who are on antihypertensive 
medications will be asked to stop them . 
CTD Alone (Phase  2). Patients will t ake CTD 25 mg/day. Two weeks later, 
they will return with a 24 -h urine collection. Venipuncture and other procedures 
as outlined in Table 1 will be performed. Subjects who develop hypokalemia 
(serum K  < 3.5 mEq/L) will immediately enter Phase 2 . The remaining patients 
will continue on CTD for another week. On return at 3 weeks, all the 
tests/procedures will be performed in all patients.

Some patients may require only 2 weeks of CTD, instead of 3 weeks. Thus, the complete 
study duration might be shorter by 1 week . 
 If patients develop symptomatic hypotension (blood pressure ≤ 90/60 
mmHg) after CTD treatment for 2 weeks, the dose of CTD wil l be reduced to 12.5 
mg daily  temporarily . Blood pressure will be repeated 1 week after dose 
reduction. If BP is increased above 120/80 mmHg, the dose of CTD will be 
increased to 25 mg daily. Few patients who cannot later tolerate a higher dose 
of 25 mg/da y will be withdrawn from the trial. If patients develop (BP ≥ 
130/80 mmHg) after CTD treatment for 2 weeks, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 5 mg daily will be 
added to the regimen for blood pressure control. Blood pressure will be repeated 
in 1 week.  
  
 CTD + KMgCit/KCl ( Phase  3). Patients who developed hypokalemia at 2 
weeks of CTD will enter Phase 3. Those who complete d three weeks of treatment 
with CTD alone will enter Phase 3 whether or not they develop hypokalemia.  All 
patients will continue to take CTD 25 mg/day. All subj ects will be randomized 
to receive K MgCit powder or KCl powder at a dose of 40 meq of K daily for 4 
months . Various tests will be performed at times indicated in Table 1.  
15 
  
Tests  
  Office blood pressure. During clinic visits at baseline, at 2 and/or 3 weeks 
of CTD alone , at monthly intervals during combined treatment with CTD and 
KMgCit or KCl  powder , the research nurse will obtain blood pressure by [CONTACT_496661]’s oscillometric device (Welch Allyn, Vital Signs, WA). At each visit, three 
blood pressur e measurements will be made after subjects sit quietly for at least 
[ADDRESS_638541] measurements 
will be averaged.  
Serum tests. At baseline, 2 and/or 3 weeks after CTD alone, and at 2 and  
4 months of co mbined CTD and K salt treatment , a fasting venous blood sample 
will be obtained for electrolytes (potassium, sodium, chloride and carbon 
dioxide), magnesium, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, triglyceride, 
cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and glucose (by [CONTACT_496662]) . Serum PTH, insulin, 
8-isoprotanes, hsCRP, FGF23 and Klotho will be measured (by [CONTACT_496663], Moe’s Laboratory or O’Brien Center). At same times, a 
sample will be frozen for aldosterone (to be determined later when warr anted by 
[CONTACT_458246]). Lymphocytes will be harvested from EDTA -treated blood sample and 
stored in RNALater for WNK1 mRNA (to be determined later when warranted in 
the laboratory of C. -L. Huang).   
 Urine Tests. A 24-h urine sample will be collected under o il at baseline, 2 
and/or 3 weeks of CTD alone, 2 months  and 4 months of combined treatment. 
Samples will be analyzed for stone risk factors (including potassium, pH, citrate, 
magnesium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, sulfate, chloride, creatinine, and 
total volume), and net acid excretion by [CONTACT_496664]. 
Samples will also be analyzed for 8 -isoprostanes (by [CONTACT_496665]’s laboratory) and  frozen 
for aldosterone ( to be determined later ).   
 At same times, a fresh spot urine sample will be obtained f or creatinine  
(by [CONTACT_496666]) , and frozen for WNK1 protein and mRNA , 
and exosomes  (to be determined in the laboratories of Huang and Moe if 
warranted). WNK1 might be a mediator of changes in renal (sodium handling) 
and vascular (resistan ce) determinants of blood pressure that might ensue from 
varying potassium intake. Exosomes are shed membranes enclosing cytoplasm 
from the kidney  shown to contain mRNA  The measurement will allow us to 
assess levels of proteins and signaling molecules invo lved in the renal mineral 
transport.   
  Side effect questionnaire. At baseline, 2 and/or [ADDRESS_638542] questionnaire by [CONTACT_496667] (Table 2). This history permits 
computation of “gastrointestinal symptom score”, a quantitative estimate of 
frequency and severity of gastrointestinal side effects (Ruml, 1999).  
16 
 Other tests. At each follow -up visit, the research nurse (D. Arbique) will 
collect the t est medications and count the number of unused packets or pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], in 
order to estimate compliance of patients in taking medications. At each visit, the 
research nurse will obtain history of unusual dietary intakes. Body weight will 
be measured. Smear of sto ol brought in by [CONTACT_496668].  
 Muscle Mg by [CONTACT_38692]. Intracellular muscle Mg will be obtained by [CONTACT_496669].  
 
 Hepatic fat by [CONTACT_38692]. Hepatic TG content will be evaluated using a1. 5 Tesla 
Gyroscan Achieva whole body clinical system (Philips Medical Systems, 
Cleveland, [LOCATION_003]) equipped with software for localized spectroscopy as described 
(Price, 2013). In short, high -resolution morphological images are collected to 
serve as a “roadmap”  for selection of a testing volume of 27 cc within the upper 
right hepatic lobe. All spectra are collected using PRESS sequence (Point 
RESolved Spectroscopy) for spatial localization and the signal acquisition with 
the following data acquisition parameters : Te = 27 ms, Tr = 3 s. All data are 
collected without water suppression. Areas of resonances from protons in water 
molecules and in methylenes of fatty acid chains will be evaluated with line -fit 
procedure using a commercial software (NUTS -ACORNNMR, Freem ont, CA).  
 
Subjects with claustrophobia or metal devices precluding MRI, will not have MRI 
completed as part of this study.

- On CTD alone, serum K would decline, reaching below normal in most 
patients. On both K MgCit powder and KCl powder along with CTD, serum 
K would increase to the normal limits. Similar levels of serum K would be 
observed during K MgCit powder vs. KCl  powder .  
- Office blood pressure would decline during CTD alone. It would remain low 
on combined K MgCit powder or KCl powder with CTD.   
- It is expected that serum and urinary isoprostanes (marker of oxidative 
stress) would increase on CTD alone, decrease on combined K MgCit 
powder + CTD and remain unchanged on KCl powder + CTD.  
- We anticipate that serum FGF23 would increase on CTD alo ne, decrease 
on addition of K MgCit powder but not KCl  powder .  
- Fasting plasma glucose and insulin w ould be higher during CTD when 
compared to baseline. K MgCit powder would atte nuate the increase in 
plasma glucose and insulin , whereas KCl powder would not . HOMA -IR 
would show changes in the same direction.  
- Serum aldosterone (marker of renin -angiotensin system) would increase 
on CTD; the a ddition of K MgCit powder would attenuate this rise, but KCl  
powder  would not.   
- The gastrointestinal symptom score during  CTD alone will be similar to 
baseline. On combined treatment, gastrointestinal symptom score would 
be higher for KCl powder than KCit  powder, with a larger percentage of 
patients complaining of dysgeusia on KCl powder .  
- At 3 weeks, 24 -hour urinary potassi um on K MgCit powder and KC l powder  
would be higher than CTD alone by [CONTACT_2902] 35 -40 meq/day. Urinary pH and 
citrate would be higher on K MgCit powder than CTD alone or KCl  powder .  
- Free muscle Mg would increase on KMgCit powder but decline on KCl 
powder.  
- Hepatic fat would increase on KCl powder + CTD, but decline or remain 
unchanged on KMgCit +  CTD.  
 
Sample Size Calculations  
18 
   From our previous CTD studies, the mean increase in fasting serum   
glucose at CTD dose of 25 mg/day plus KCl supplementation to keep serum K 
constant was 10 mg/dL. The within subject SD of serum  glucose was between 
2.0-8.5. Assuming SD = 8.5, power of 0.8 and  of 0.05, 60  patients (30 
randomized to KCl powder and 30 to KMgCit  powder ) would be needed to detect 
a potential reduction in serum  glucose of 6  mg/dL  by [CONTACT_496670] . Assuming SD of 
5, power of 0.80 and  of 0.05, [ADDRESS_638543] a potential 
reduction in serum  glucose of 4 mg/dL  by [CONTACT_496670] . To account for a dropo ut of 
20%, we plan to recruit  72 subjects for the study.  
 
Statistical Methods  
  Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be used to 
summarize blood pressure and other responses for the three phases. Data from 
the three phases will be compared by [CONTACT_496671]. Significant differences between the three phases will be further 
analyzed by [CONTACT_496672]. By [CONTACT_18120] B onferroni inequality to adjust for multiple 
testing, various comparisons between phases will be made. In addition, the 
existence of a trend in the differences of various parameters between phases will 
be sought (Perlman, 2002). Interim analysis will be per formed at 50% completion 
of the trial.

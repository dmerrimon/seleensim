Title of Study:  
A Phase 1/2a, open- label multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and 
preliminary antitumor activity o f PEN -221 in patients with somatostatin receptor 2 expressing 
advanced cancers, including gastroenteropancreatic or lung or thymus or other neuroendocrine 
tumors or small cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine carcino ma of the lung  
Phase of development:  
1/2a 
Study Design:  
PEN -221 is a peptide-drug conjugate combining a somatostatin analog and mertansine (DM1), a 
thiol- containing maytansinoid, using a cleavable disulfide linker. The molecule is designed as a 
potent and selective anti -cancer agent to treat patients whose tumors express the somatostatin receptor 
SSTR2 , namely, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung. In preclinical studies,  PEN -[ADDRESS_1124481]-in-human Phase 1/2a study evaluating 
PEN -221 in patients with SSTR2 expressing advanced gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or lung or 
thymus or other NETs or SCLC or LCNEC of the lung. 
Pre-screening  phase  
After provision of written informed consent for pre -screening , patients will have their cancers 
assessed for SSTR2 expression using an approved  somatostatin analog radioisotope imaging (SARI) 
agent.  
Patients who have undergone recent SARI, i.e., within the preceding approximately [ADDRESS_1124482] the results 
reviewed by [CONTACT_812108]2 positivity in lieu of undergoing 
repeat imaging  during the Pre- screening phase. Patients whose tumors are determined to be positive 
for SSTR2 expression by [CONTACT_812109].  
Screening phase  
After provision of written informed consent for the study, patients whose tumors were determined to 
be SSTR2 positive during the Pre-screening phase will proceed to the Screening phase of the study. 
Screening assessments include a careful review of the patient’s medical history, assessment of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), physical examination, neurological 
examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory assessments, and computed tomography (C T) 
or magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) of all sites of disease.  
Screening assessments are to be performed within [ADDRESS_1124483] study drug 
dose. 
Patients who are determined to be eligible based on Screening assessments will be enrolled in the 
study on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1; baseline).

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 Treatment phase  (Phase 1 and Phase 2a)  
Phase 1  will enroll patients with SS TR2 expressing advanced gastroe nteropancreatic (GEP)  or lung or 
thymus or other NETs or SCLC  or LCNEC of the lung who have provided informed consent for the 
main study. 
Phase [ADDRESS_1124484] inal mid -gut NET, or with advanced  or metastatic, well differentiated, low- 
intermediate grade pancreatic NET or  with advanced or metastatic SCLC . 
The safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PDc) and anti- tumor activity of PEN-221 
will be assessed . Safety will be assessed during the study by [CONTACT_363588], physical 
examinations, neurological examinations, ECOG PS, documentation of adverse events (AEs), clinical 
laboratory tests, and ECGs.  
Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD c) assessments will be 
collected from all patients.  
Tumor response assessments will be performed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST), version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009) . Patients with advanced NETs will undergo tumor 
assessments every third cycle, and patients with advanced SCLC  or LCNEC of the lung will undergo 
tumor assessments every other cycle. For patients who have a tumor (complete or partial RECIST) 
response, a repeat evaluation to confirm response will be performed approximately 6 weeks (but not 
less than 4 weeks) after the initial response.  
Patients may continue to receive PEN -221 as long as they are considered to show clinical benefit, as 
judged by [CONTACT_737], and in the absence of discontinuation criteria. 
Phase 1 (Dose escalation)  
Phase 1 will employ an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLR M) with 2 parameters 
guided by [CONTACT_111814] (EWOC) principle to make dose recommendations and 
estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  
To minimize the number of patients treated at potentially subtherapeutic dose levels, the first dose 
cohort will enroll 2 patients, whereas subsequent cohorts will enroll a minimum of 3 and up to 6 patients. The initial patient in Cohort 1 will receive PEN -221 administered intravenously (IV) over [ADDRESS_1124485] 2 patients will be assessed 
for safety and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) for at least 4 weeks (including C2D1 and C2D8 
assessments) before enrollment in the second cohort may begin. 
In each dose escalation cohort  follo wing the first cohort, a minimum of [ADDRESS_1124486] 3 weeks 
(including C2D1 pre- dose assessments) before enrollment o f the next cohort may begin. 
The Safety  Review Committee (SRC)  will review the safety and tolerability of PEN -221 of each 
cohort to decide the next dose level to be tested . Statistical modeling will be performed using all 
safety data and will guide the SRC’s selection of dose levels to be tested. In addition, PK and PDc 
data may be used to inform dose selection. Dose escalation increments will be the decision of the 
SRC. Dose escalation will continue until the MTD is determined. 
During Phase [ADDRESS_1124487] been 
assessed for safety t hrough and including C2D1 , and the SRC has reviewed all safety data and 
recommends continuing with Phase 2a.

Phase [ADDRESS_1124504] 10 patients treated 
at MTD level. The actual number of patients will depend on the number of dose levels/cohorts that 
are tested.  
An adaptive BLR model guided by [CONTACT_111814] (EWOC) principle (Babb 
1998; Neuenschwander 2008)  will be employed to make dose recommendations and estimate the 
MTD. The MTD will be further evaluated for anti-tumor activity and overall tolerability during Phase 
2a. 
The MTD is defined as the highest dose for a given schedule that is not  expected by [CONTACT_812112] 33% of patients during the first cycle of treatment. The dose- toxicity (DLT) 
relationship will be described by a Bayesian 2 -parameter logistic regression model. A vague bivariate 
normal prior for the model parameters  will be used based on prior guesses (medians) from preclinical 
data and wide confidence intervals for the probabilities of a DLT at each dose.  
Dose recommendation 
After each cohort of patients has completed C1, the posterior distributions for the probabilities of 
DLT rates at different dose levels will be obtained and summarized in terms of the estimated 
probabilities that the true rate of DLT at each  dose- level will have of lying in each of the following 
intervals:  
• [0, 0.16) under-dosing   
• [0.16, 0.33) targeted toxicity   
• [0.33, 1.00] excessive toxicity.    
Following the principle of EWOC, after each cohort of patients the recommended dose will be the one with the highest posterior probability of the DLT r ate falling in the target interval [16%, 33%) 
among the doses fulfilling EWOC, i.e., it is unlikely (<25% posterior probability) that the DLT rate at 
the dose falls in the excessive toxicity interval.  
The recommended dose for the next cohort via this algorithm will not represent more than a doubling of the current dose.  
 
Phase 2a  
During Phase 2a, approximately 75 patients will be enrolled  in the following cohorts: gastrointestinal 
mid-gut NET (n= 35), pancreatic NET  (n=20), and SCLC (n=20). Ea ch of these cohorts will be 
enrolled in [ADDRESS_1124505] been treated at this new dose to review 
the data and confirm that subsequent patients be enrolled into the study at this new dose. 
In addition, at any time during Phase 2a , the BLRM may be re-run to confirm the estimated MTD and 
verify that the dose under study still satisfies the overdose criteri on. If the dose fails to satisfy the 
criterion a change to the dose under study may be decided by [CONTACT_12217], according to the Bayesian 
model recommendation, and  after review of the clinical data. The SRC decision to change dose may 
also be spurred by [CONTACT_812113] (e.g. frequency of lower grade AEs  or 
events in later treatment  cycles). Subsequent patients may then be enrolled at this new dose until at 
least 6 patients are treated at this new dose level and upon SRC review of the data the SRC will 
decide whether the new dose level is appropriate for continued study. 
After Phase 2a, the final recommended dose for future development will be based on considerations 
of the MTD estimated by [CONTACT_111831], and on an overall clinical assessment of all available safety, 
tolerability, PK , and PD c data from all cycles at all different dose levels tested, in both phases of the 
study. 
In the gastrointestinal mid -gut NET or P NET group, a CBR of approximately 75% or greater would 
be considered promising. For a group of 20 patients, if the observed proportion is 0.75 (clinical 
benefit observed in 15 out of 20 patients) , there is 90.4% probability that the true underlying 
proportion exceeds 0.6, and 63.7% probability that the true underlying proportion exceeds 0.7. If the 
true underlying proportion is 0.75, there is 1.4 % probability to observe a CBR of 50% or less .For a 
group of 35 patients, if the observed proportion is 0.74 (clinical benefit observed in 26 out of 35 
patients), there is 95.5% probability that the true underlying proportion exceeds 0.6, and 67.5% 
probability that the true underlying proportion exceeds 0.7. If the true underlying proportion is 0.75, there is 0.1% probability to observe a CBR of 50% or less. 
For the SCLC  cohort, a response rate of 30% or greater would be considered promising. For a group 
of 20 patients , if the observed proportion is 0.3, there is 99.7 % probability that the true  underlying 
proportion exceeds 0.1, and 55% probability that the true  underlying proportion exceeds 0.3. If the 
true underlying proportion is 0.3, there is 0.1% probability to observe 0 responses.  
 
Sample size calculations  
Based on the performance characteristics computed and described in the previous section, the sample 
sizes are adequate to address the study ’s objectives. No formal statistical power calculations to  
determine sample size were performed.  
General  statistical considerations  
As a general strategy, data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_812114] s in Phase 1 and by [CONTACT_812115] s in Phase 2a. 
Demographic and baseline  characteristics will be summarized using data from all patient s in the Full 
Analysis ( ITT) set by [CONTACT_74299]/or dose group. Treatment exposure, including duration on treatment 
and extent of exposure to study drug, will be summarized by [CONTACT_74299]/or dose group. 
Safety analysis will include summaries by [CONTACT_74299]/or dose group of: AEs , laboratory measures, 
physical examinations, neurological examinations, ECG, and vital signs using data from patient s in 
the Safety Analysis set.  
The incidence of DLTs will be summarized using data from the Dose Determining set.  
PK endpoints, including peak concentration, trough plasma concentration and area under the plasma 
concentration curve, will be tabulated for all patient s in the PK Analysis set.  
Objective response rate and CBR will be reported with category counts, percentage and 95% 
confidence interval.  Duration of response (DO R), progression -free survival ( PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) will be evaluated using Kaplan -Meier estimates and curves will be generated based on these 
estimates.  Primary  efficacy analyses will be based on data from all patient s in the efficacy analysis 
(EA) population.

Note: PEN -221 dosing of e ach cycle should begin within 21±2 days of D1 of previous cycle  unless PEN -221 is withheld for safety reasons . Visit windows may 
be lengthened for administrative reasons (e.g., holiday) after consultation with the Medical Monitor . 
1. If a patient discontinues treatment prior to objective disease progression, then the pat ient should continue to be followed until objective disease prog ression 
as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.  For SCLC  or LCNEC of the lung  patients, approximately every [ADDRESS_1124507] arting with a dose escalati on . If no Grade 2  or higher abnormalities in clinical 
chemistries or hematology parameters during Cycles 1 and 2, or in the two cycles starting with a dose escalation ( Section 8.11.1), then the  D8 and  D15 
evaluations may be eliminated in subsequent cycles, subject to Investigator discretion. If Grade [ADDRESS_1124508] been associated with bradycardia.  
6. Triplicate ECGs are to be collected  approximately 5 minutes apart . On C1D1 and C 3D1, ECGs are to be performed immediately prior to the start of study  
drug infusion, at 30 minutes after the start of the infusion, precisely at the end of infusion, and at all scheduled PK timep oints thereafter; the date and time of 
each ECG start and stop are to be documented. On all other dosing days, ECGs should be performed prior to infusion and at end of infusion.  
7. Hematology parameters inclu de hemoglobin , red blood cell (RBC) count, platelet count, and white blood cell (WBC) count with differential. Samples may 
be collected up to  [ADDRESS_1124509] continue to qualify patients  as defined in the study eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria . 
8. Clinical chemistries include chloride, bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, total 
protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) , AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin,  amylase, and lipase. Samples may be collected up to [ADDRESS_1124510] continue 
to qualify patients as defined in the study eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria.  
9. On C1D1, glucose will be monitored along with PK sam ples: pre -dose, at 0.5 hours (±5 minute s) after the start of study drug infusion; precisely at the end of 
infusion   (±1  minute ); and 1.5 hours (± 10 minutes), 2 hours (± 10 minutes), 4 hours (± 10 minutes), 6 hours (± 10 minutes), 8 hours (± 30 minutes), and 10 
hours (± 60 minutes) after the start of study drug infusion. If the 10 hour time point requires an inpatient admission at the center, the  10 hour time point will 
not be collected. If the patient experiences symptomatic hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or if any glucose level falls below 55 mg/dL (or below 3.0 
mmol/L) or above 250 mg/dL (or above 13.9 mmol/L) at any timepoint on C1D1, this intense sampling will be repeated (regardles s of whether PK samples 
are collected) on D1 of each subsequent cycle until the above criteria are no longer met throughout an entire treatment day .  
For any patients on concomitant anti- hyperglycemic medications, glucose should be monitored carefully and doses of these medications  should be adjusted 
if needed, as somatostatin analogs have been associated with changes in blood glucose levels and regulation.  
10. Coagulation studies include prothrombin time (PT)  and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT ).  For patients on Coumadin or warfarin only,  international 
normalized ratio  should also be included . 
11. Urinalysis includes specific gravity, pH, blood, glucose, protein, ketones, and microscopic examination of sediment.  
12. Thyroid function to be monitored as free T4 and thyroid- stimulati ng hormone  (TSH) .

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Investigational A gent 
PEN -221 is a novel peptide- drug conjugate that is being developed as a targeted anticancer agent 
for the treatment of patients with neuroendocrine tumors or other tumors of neuroendocrine 
origin  or small cell lung cancer  (SCLC)  whose tumors overexpress the somatostatin receptor 2 
(SSTR2). PEN -221 contains a somatostatin analog with high potency and selecti vity for SSTR2 
conjugated to DM1 (mertansine) , a thiol-containing maytansinoid, using a cleavable disulfide 
linker. The linker is designed to be preferentially cleaved in the reducing environment of the 
tumor, thereby [CONTACT_812118]1 in tumor cells where it acts by [CONTACT_812119], resulting in apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe (Barok 
2014). Significant antitumor activity has been seen in multiple SSTR2 positive xenograft models.  
Higher levels of anti-tumor activity, including complete regressions, were observed with either 
repeat dosing at a relatively low dose or with a single relatively high dose.  These observations 
suggest potential for activity in patients with SSTR2 -expressin g tumors. 
4.2. Neuroendocrine T umors  
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a relatively rare, biologically and clinically heterogeneous group of malignant neoplasms that arise from neuroendocrine cells throughout the body and are 
most commonly formed in the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract, pancreas, or lung.  Other less common 
neuroendocrine tumors include those arising in the parathyroid, thyroid, adrenal and pi[INVESTIGATOR_812085]. These tumors are characterized by [CONTACT_812120]. They are often associated with characteristic 
symptoms  such as flushing and diarrhea. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_812086]  (NCCN 2016). 
NETs are generally classified by [CONTACT_80060], histological characteristics, stage, and grade . 
Histological classification is based on tumor differentiation (well or poorly di fferentiated) . NETs 
are staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ) TNM  staging system. 
Tumor g rade (Grades 1 – 3) is generally defined by [CONTACT_812121]/or Ki-67 index. 
Functioning vs. non-functioning tumors are part of the clinical diagnosis based on whether or not 
tumors are associated with symptoms of hormone hypersecretion. The National Cancer Institute 
(NCI at  http://cancer.gov/) separates its  detailed information on background, staging, and 
treatment of NETs into 4  main groups: gastrointestinal carcinoids (well- differentiated NETs or 
carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract);  pancreatic NETs; small cell lung cancer (SCLC); and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_812087]-small cell lung cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN at 
http://nccn.org ) practice guidelines group NETs into [ADDRESS_1124524] tumors: neuroendocrine tumors of 
the GI tract, lung and thymus ( carcinoids), pancreatic NETs (P NETs), NETs with an unknown 
primary, adrenal gland tumors, pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, poorly differentiated  
neuroendocrine carcinoma or large or small cell carcinoma other than lung, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) , MEN type 2 (MEN2), and M erkel cell carcinoma. 
Surgical resection is the only curative treatment and is generally recommended for patients with localized disease or those whose primary and metastatic sites that are amenable to a complete 
resection. If the tumor is not resectable, standard of care varies depending on the anatomical site 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 37 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 of the primary tumor as well as tumor grade . Somatostatin analogs are prescribed to palliate 
symptoms of functional tumors and to slow tumor growth. Liver- directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812088], liver -predominant metastatic disease. In addition, everolimus, interferon alfa-2b, or 
cytotoxic chemotherapy may be indicated for clinically significant progressive disease; s unitinib 
may be an option for P NETs  (NCCN 2016) . 
Somatostatin analogs are used routinely to control symptoms related to hormone hypersecretion 
in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (Chan 2016) . In addition, randomized controlled trials 
have established that somatostatin analogs delay tumor growth in patients with advanced, well-
differentiated or moderately -differentiated enteropancreatic tumors. In the randomized, double-
blind PROMID  trial (Rinke 2009) , eighty -five patients with locally inoperabl e or metastatic 
well-differentiated, functioning or nonfunctioning intestinal NETs were randomized to receive 
treatment with either long -acting  octreotide (Octreotide LAR ) or pl acebo. There was a 
statistically significant prolongation in time to progression, compared to placebo (median 14.3 versu s 6.0 months). In the randomized, double-blind CLARINET trial (Caplin 2014) , 204 
patients with advanced well - or moderately -differe ntiated, non-functioning, enteropancreatic 
NETs , patients were randomized  to receive treatment with either an extended release aqueous -
gel formulation of lanreotide  (n=101) or placebo (n=103). Lanreotide, as compared to placebo, 
was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (median not reached vs. median 18.0 months). 
Molecularly targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812089], low 
or intermediate grade NETs . The  mTOR inhibitor everolimus showed a significant improvement 
in progression- free survival in advanced pancreatic (Yao 2011) and  advanced gastrointestinal or 
lung NETs (Yao 2016) , but was associated with RECIST tumor response rates of only 2 to 5%. 
For patients with advanced pancreatic NET, sunitinib is approved based on the results of a 
randomized Phase 3 study that demonstrated improved progression-free survival compared to 
placebo  (Raymond 2011) . 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy can lead to objective tumor responses in patients with pancreatic NETs, 
and is recommended for patien ts with well differentiated N ETs who have bulky, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_387265]; however, no prospective clinical trials have observed benefits in progression 
free or overall survival  (Kunz 2015) . 
The concept of targeting somatostatin receptor with somatostatin analogs linked to an anti- cancer 
payload has been demon strated in the clinic . Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) 
delivers yttrium-90 or lutetium-177 coupled to DOTATATE, an amide of the acid DOTA, which 
acts as a chelator  for a radionuclide, and ( Tyr
3)-octreotate , a derivative of the somatostatin 
analog octreotide. The latter binds to somatostatin receptors , which are found on the cell surfaces 
of a number of NETs and direct the radioactivity into the tumor. PRRT has resulted in tumor response rates of approximately 15 to 35% in patients with advanced GEP NETs  in 
nonrandomized studies (van der Zwan 2015) . A recent Phase 3 study randomized 230 patients 
with advanced mid-gut NETs to receive 4 doses of 
177Lu-DOTATATE (4 × 7.4 GBq every 8 
weeks) plus symptom control treatment with 30 mg long- acting octreotid e (Octreotide LAR ) 
compared to high dose (60 mg) Octreotide LAR every 4 weeks  (Strosberg 2015) . There was a 
statistically significant improvement in progression -free survival in the 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 
30 mg Octreotide LAR group; t he median PFS was not reached for 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 38 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 mg Octreotide LAR  and was 8.4 months with 60 mg Octreotide LA R (hazard ratio 0.21 [95% CI: 
0.13-0.34], p<0.0001) O bjective response rates were 19% in the patients randomized to 177Lu-
DOTATATE plus 30 mg Octreotide LAR vs. 3% in patients randomized to 60 mg octreotide 
LAR.  
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are cat echolamine-secreting neuroendocrine tumors 
that arise from chromaffin cells of the adrenal  medulla ( pheochromocytomas) and the extra-
adrenal autonomic paraganglia ( paragangliomas). Approximately 10 percent of 
pheochromocytomas, 20 to 25% of extra- adrenal a bdominal and mediastinal paragangliomas , 
and 2 to 19% of skull base and neck paragangliomas are metastatic; 5- year survival rates are 
generally less than 50%  (Chan 2016; McGranahan 2016). For patients with meta -
iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)- positive tumors with  unresectable, symptomatic progressive 
disease, 131I-MIBG is a first -line treatment approach . For patients with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_10480], 
MIBG -negative disease or disease that is predominantly localized to the skeleton, chemotherapy 
such as combination therapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine , and dacarbazine is an option. 
Clinical trials of sunitinib in patie nts with advanced/malignant 
pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma are ongoing (Chan 2016; McGranahan 2016) . 
As reviewed by  [CONTACT_812122] (2011) , Merkel cell carcinomas (MCCs) are very rare but very aggressive 
skin cancers likely arising from cutaneous mechanoreceptor cells (Merkel cells) in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_812090] . They mostly occur as red or bluish nodules, growing on the head, neck, extremities, 
or trunk, and are associated with s un exposure, immunocompromise, and a polyomavirus. 
Disease that is not treatable by [CONTACT_812123], combined with either etoposide or doxorubicin. Response rates as high as 40% have 
been observed, but are rarely sustained. Recurrent disease has been treated with radiation or 
chemotherapy but results have been poor. Nghiem (2016)  describe a phase 2 study of 
pembrolizumab (an anti- PD-1 agent) where 56% overall response and 16% complete response 
was obs erved in 25 evaluable MCC  patients.  
Medulary thyroid carcinomas  (MTCs) arise from calcitonin -producing C- cells (Hadoux 2016) . 
Distant metastases are the main cause of death . Vandetanib , an inhibitor of kinases of the 
vascular endo thelial growth factor rectptors  (VEGFRs) 2 and 3, Ret proto- oncogene (RET) , and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] , is approved in both the US and EU for treatment of MTC. A placebo-
controlled phase 3 trial with 331 patients showed significant prolongation of PFS with a 65% 
relative reduction of risk of disease progression, and 44% partial response rate (Wells 2012). (No 
complete responses were observed.) Cabozantinib, an inhibitor of RET, VEGFR2, and hepatocyte growth factor receptor , produced partial response in 28% of patients  (Elisei 2013) . In 
contrast, c hemotherapy with single or multiple agents has only yielded response rates of less than 
20% (Hadoux 2016) . 
4.3. Small Cell Lung Cancer  and Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma 
of the Lung  
SCLC represents 15  – 20% of all lung cancers.  Little progress has been made over the last 30 
years in identifying effective new treatments and median overall survival is only about 12 
months (Morabito 2014). The traditional staging system classifies SCLC into 2 stages, according 
to the extent of disease (Mountain 2000) . Limite d disease (LD) , diagnosed in about 1/3 of 
patients, is confined to the hemithorax with regional lymph node metastasis and can be treated 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 39 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 within a single field of radiation . Extensive disease (ED), diagnosed in approx imately 2/3 of 
patients, extends beyond a single radiation field (National Cancer Institute 2016) . 
Patients with LD can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, or both, and also may be candidates 
for chemotherapy, especially if Ki -67 score is greater than 50%  (National Cancer Institute 2016) . 
Patients with ED do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_812091] ; chemotherapy  with 
platinum and etoposide is first-line standard of care. Upo n relapse, topotecan is approved for 
second -line therapy, and paclitaxel, docetaxel , irinotecan, temozolomide, gemcitabine, or 
ifosfamide  may be used for subsequent therapy  (National Cancer Insti tute 2016) . A variety of 
agents, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), m ammalian  target of rapamycin (mTOR)  
inhbitors, and other targeted agents have been tested unsuccessfully as SCLC treatments. DNA 
repair and cellular developmental pathway inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, 
immunomodulators, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and anti- SCLC vaccines are in studie s 
(Mamdani 2015). Recent testing of an antibody-drug conjugate targeting delta-like 3 (DLL3) has 
shown promise, with a cohort of 29 DLL3+ patients demonstrating 34% partial response and 
31% disease stabilization, and durable response of more than 178 days. 
Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung is a biologically aggressive, high 
grade cancer that accounts for approximately 3% of all lung cancers. Due to the lack of 
controlled cli nical trials, there are no s tandard treatment regimens.  Retrospective analyses of 
clinical outcomes in small series of patients with advanced or metastatic disease suggest that 
response rates to platinum based doublet chemotherapy in the first- line, advanced disease setting  
are similar to those achieved in patients with SCLC; overall survival is poor, with median OS 
ranging from 8 to 16 months depending on the study (Fasano 2015) . In the second- line or later 
setting, data are sparse; a  retrospective analysis of 18 LCNEC of the lung treated with amrubicin 
as a single agent , all of whom were previously treated with platinum based doublet 
chemotherapy, resulte d in an objective response rate of 27.7%  (Yoshida 2011) . 
4.4. Somatostatin Receptor Expression in Cancers of Neuroendocrine 
Origin  
Somatostatin is a small cyclic peptide. As described by  [CONTACT_812124] (2001) , it is widely expressed in 
the body, predominantly in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. In brain, it can be both stimulato ry and inhibitory, but in peripheral tissue it mostly inhibits secretion processes. 
Somatostatin  acts through binding to five different high- affinity G -protein coupled membrane 
SSTRs . All five receptors are expressed in brain  and islets; all but SSTR4 are expressed  in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_304]. Tumors originating from somatostatin target tissues often express a high density of various receptors. 
Overexpression of these receptors on tumors provides a potential target for direct delivery of 
anti-cancer agents . Cancer s of neuroendocrine origin including NETs of pancreatic, 
gastrointestinal, lung or other tissue origin, SCLC  (Barbieri 2013; O'By[CONTACT_7943] 1994; Reubi 2001) , 
medullary thyroid cancers , and others  (Barbieri 2013; de Herder 2003; Hofland 2001)  have often 
been found to overexpress SSTR and are drug development targets for SSTR -drug treatment. 
Reubi (2001) describe expression of SSTRs in both normal and various neoplastic tissues using autoradiograph y. 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1124525] been perfor med to evaluate the pharmacology of 
PEN -221 to support and guide its  clinical evaluation.  
4.6. Nonclinical P harmac ology S tudies  
PEN -221 is designed to bind to the somatostatin receptor SSTR2 and be inte rnalized into cancer 
cells overexpressing this receptor  to deliver a cytotoxic payload . In vitro  radioligand competitive 
binding assays compa ring PEN -221 affinity to the 5 somatostatin receptor family members 
(SSTR1 -5) demonstrated PEN-[ADDRESS_1124526] (as measured by [CONTACT_755865] H3, or PHH3) and decreases in cellular proliferation . These effects were shown to be dependent upon PEN-221 specific binding to 
SSTR2. These in vitro  data demonstrate that PEN -221 affects cancer viability via selective 
SSTR2 binding, stimulation of receptor internalization, induction of cell cycle (mitotic) arrest and apoptosis. 
The mechanism of action of PEN -221 was explored in vivo  in a study that examined  the PDc 
effects in tumors after PEN -221 dosing of mice. Rapid SSTR2 internalization by [CONTACT_12134]-H524 
SCLC tumor cells was demonstrated, with measurement of high levels of internalized SSTR2 
following a single dose of PEN-221 to tumor xenograft- bearing mice.  Additional in vivo PDc  
studies were carried out to measure the biological effects of a single dose of PEN -221 treatment 
on a second SSTR2 expressing SCLC xenograft model, NCI-H69. Using either an immunohistochemistry ( IHC) or an  enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) based 
approach, significant increases in the apoptotic marker, cleaved caspase 3 and the mitosis marker, PHH3 , were observed in tumors in response to administration of PEN-221at dose s as 
low as 0.5 mg/kg to mice. The PEN -[ADDRESS_1124527] and apoptosis of tumor cells and support the mechanism of antitumor efficacy with tumor regressions seen in the xenograft models described below. 
Significant anti- tumor activity,  including complete regressions with some treatment r egimens, 
was demonstrated in 3 SSTR2-positive SC LC models (NCI-H69, MCI-H524 MD , HCC -33 NCI-
H82) and 1 neuroblastoma model ( IMR -32). Doses tested ranged fro m 0.25 to 2.5 mg/kg with 
complet e regressions seen following a single dose as low as 1.0 mg/kg in the NCI -H69 model. In 
the HCC -33 model, with a dose as low as 0.33 mg/kg a dministered once a week for 4  weeks . 
Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 83% was observed . Additionally, superior efficacy was 
observed with a single dose of PEN-[ADDRESS_1124528] potential for activity in patients 
with SSTR2 -expressing tumors. 
4.7. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  and Drug Metabolism  
PEN -221 is a peptide- drug conjugate consisting of a somatostatin analog attached to the 
cytotoxin DM1, a thiol-containing maytansinoid, using a disulfide linker. The somatostatin 
analog provides tumor targeting, while DM1 provides antitumor activity. A series of nonclinical studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of PEN -221. 
A single bolus IV administration of PEN -221 resulted in the similar  plasma pharmacokinetics for 
NCr nude mice, Sprague- Dawley rats, and b eagle dogs. The pharmacokinetic curves showed bi-
phasic profiles, with low clearances (CL) and low to moderate steady state volumes of 
distribution (V
ss) resulting in the average PEN -221 plasma half -lives  (t1/2) of 12.[ADDRESS_1124529] human pharmacokinetic s. The l ow 
plasma PEN -221 clearance rate with  the low volume of distribution were projected for humans 
resulting in  a predicted half -life for PEN -221 of 2.4 hours. 
The membrane permeability of PEN -221 was shown to be very low in a Caco-2 cell monolayer 
assay indicating low passive permeability across cell membranes. The reversible binding in plasma of PEN -221 was studied in mouse, rat, dog, and human plasma. The u nbound fraction of 
PEN -221 was similar across species (3.3%  –10.6%) and was not dependent on the concentration. 
Since PEN -221 is designed to deliver the toxin DM1 into the cells, measurement of total DM1 in 
the tumors and tis sues was used to evaluate PEN -221 distribution. Following administration of a 
single dose of PEN-221 to mice bearing NCI-H69 xenograft tumors expressing high levels of 
SSTR2 , the maximum DM1 levels in tumors were seen  between 2 and 8 hours  after the dosing. 
The total DM1 levels in tumors showed a significantly longer half- life than PEN -221 in plasma. 
Decreases in DM1 tumor levels of less than 50% were seen between day [ADDRESS_1124530] total DM1 levels were seen in the kidneys 
followed by [CONTACT_812125] > lung s > spleen  > liver > rough 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]  > pancreas. Very low levels of total DM1 were detected in the skeletal muscle and the 
bone marrow. 
PEN -221 excretion af ter a single IV  dose was evaluated in Sprague- Dawley rats. Over a 24 hour 
period, 8.48% of the PEN-[ADDRESS_1124531] PEN -221 excreted in urine. 
4.8. Nonclinical Toxicology S tudies  
PEN -221 toxicity was eval uated in 6 exploratory/dose range finding studies and 2 repeat dose IV  
GLP toxicology studies. Both rat and dog are relevant species for assessment of toxicity, based on sequence conservation of the PEN-221 targeting moiety (somatostatin) and the somatosta tin 
receptor (SSTR2) across species  (Creutzfeldt 1987; Flyvbjerg 1992; Hatzoglou 1995; Kaupmann

toxicities of maytansinoid co mpounds in humans, dogs and rats (Leighton 2013; Poon 2013; 
Thake 1975). Dose -range finding studies in rat and dog, established the dose levels and timing of 
measurements and endpoints for GLP  repeat -dose studies in both species. Findings showed rat to 
be the more PEN -221 sensitive species and therefore the STD 10 in rat has been used to justify the 
Phase 1 starting dose as noted in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The non-GLP studies were designed as exploratory or dose- range finding studies to assist in the 
dose selection for the GLP repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs and for the GLP 
cardi ovascular safety pharmacology study in dogs. The highest dose in the rat GLP study was set 
at 1.0 mg/kg while the highest dose in the dog GLP study was set at 0.24 mg/kg. 
Repeat -dose GLP toxicology studies in rat and dog were designed to evaluate PEN-[ADDRESS_1124532] dose through blood sampling at multiple time points and histopathology and to evaluate the consequences and 
recovery from repeat dosing. Dose levels tested in the rat repeat dose GLP study were 0.55 
mg/kg, 0.76 mg/kg, and 1.0 mg/kg. In dogs, the dose levels for the GLP study were 0.16 mg/kg, 0.20 mg/kg, and 0.24 mg/kg. Terminal groups of animals were euthanized on Day 8 while 
recovery groups were eutha nized on Day 42. Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, 
clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopic examinations, and 
clinical and anatomic pathology. Safety pharmacology endpoints including a functional 
operational battery (FOB) of tests were conducted and clinical observations were monitored that 
included assessment of CNS (e.g. tremors, convulsion, unusual/abnormal behaviors or motor movements, sensorimotor responses), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (rate and ease), and cardiovascular safety pharmacology parameters.  
Toxicokinetic assessments and collections for immunogenicity assessments were included in both rat and dog GLP studies. Blood sampling for determination of plasma concentrations of 
PEN -221, total DM1, and peptide ligand (BT-979) was conducted for 36 hours starting on Days 
1 and 21. In rats the mean plasma C
0 and mean area under the plasma concentration time curve 
from zero to 36 hours ( AUC 0-36h) values of PEN-221, total DM1, and BT- 979 increase in an 
approximately dose proportional manner on Days 1 and 21. AUC 0-36h did not change 
significantly following repeat administration. A moderate sex difference was observed in rats 
with a 1.5 – 1.9-fold higher PEN-221 AUC 0-36h in males and a 1.5 – 2.2-fold higher total DM1 
AUC 0-36h in females. These differences in AUC 0-36h values resulted in differences in the ratio of 
DM1 to PEN-221. In females, ratios > 8 were observed and in males the ratio remained ≤  2.4. 
The net result was a higher AUC 0-36h for DM1 in female rats. In dogs the mean C 0 and mean 
AUC 0-36h values of PEN-221, total DM1, and BT-979 increased in an approximately dose 
proportional manner on Days 1 and 21. AUC 0-36h to PEN -221, total DM1, and BT-979 did not 
change following repeat administration. There was no difference in the toxicokinetics of PEN-
221, DM1, or BT -979 in male and female dogs. The DM1 AUC 0-36h was on average 1.37-fold 
higher than the PEN- 221 AUC 0-36h. 
In the rat study, a single female administered 1  mg/kg PEN-221 was found dead on Day 29. This 
animal was noted with d ecreased body weight and clinical observations of thin appearance, red 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 43 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 material around the nose, and forefeet discolored red. Histopathology findings were lymphoid 
depletion in thymus, decreased hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow of the femur and 
sternum, bilateral severe hemorrhage in the adrenal glands, Kupffer cell hypertrophy, and cytoplasmic alteration of hepatocytes  including increased mitotic figures . The cause of death was 
considered treatment related. In the repeat dose GLP study in dogs, there were no mortalities.  
Weight loss and decreases in food consumption were observed in rats after dosing with reversal and weight gains seen during the study. Overall, by [CONTACT_283656], the mean 
body weight for high- dose males and females were reduced by 4.9% and 12.4%, respectively, 
when compared to control values. Notable clinical observations in the GLP rat study were 
decreased activity, thin, unkempt appearance in a few animals at the higher doses. In dogs, 
minimal, transient decreases in  body weight were noted in all PEN-[ADDRESS_1124533] dose which correlated with transiently decreased food consumption in the high PEN-221 
dose group. Similarly, a minimal, transient decrease in body weight was noted in high dose 
group male and female dogs following the second administration of PEN-221. These changes in 
the dogs exhibited complete resolution. 
There were no treatment -related effects noted in ophthalmic exams in the rat or dog GLP studies. 
In rats, hematology and coagulat ion changes at the terminal necropsy were decreased red cell 
mass in both sexes at all PEN -221 dose levels with decreased reticulocyte counts (females, mid- 
and high dose groups) and decreased total leukocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts (males, 
mid- and high-dose groups and all female groups). Due to the severity of the changes, decreases 
in red cell mass, reticulocyte and neutrophil counts were considered adverse in high dose group 
males and mid -and high- dose femal e animals. The noted differences may be due to the higher 
DM1 exposure in the female rats. Also noted was an increase in platelet counts in PEN-221 treated males. Following the second dose, at the recovery necropsy, increased reticulocyte counts in mid -dose males and high -dose females were noted that correlated with resolution of red cell 
mass changes (noted following the first PEN 221 dose). The clinical pathology changes observed in dogs were decreases in reticulocyte counts and platelet counts in both se xes in mid - and high-
dose PEN-221 dose groups. Transient decreases in lymphocyte counts in both sexes at the high dose were noted on Days 4 and 24 that resolved 7 days following administration.  
Decreased  activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT) and pro longed prothrombin time (PT) 
were observed in high dose group female rats and increased fibrinogen was noted in females at 
the mid and high PEN -221 dose levels. In the GLP study in dogs, there were no PEN-221 related 
effects noted for coagulation. 
Urinalys is evaluation on Day 42 revealed absence of sperm in the urine of male rats in the high 
dose PEN-221 group. There were no notable urinalysis findings in dogs. 
In rats, clinical chemistry findings on Day 4 indicated hepatocellular and hepatobiliary effects in 
both sexes at all dose levels with observations of increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities, and increased total 
bilirubin concentration that was primarily attributable to dire ct bilirubin. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_812092], ALT, ALP, and total bilirubin levels, these changes were transient and were not associated 
with correlative microscopic liver changes at either terminal or recovery necropsies. Erythrocyte 
hemolysis may have contributed to the elevations in AST and ALT activities and total bilirubin concentration, as well. However, no significant hemolysis was observed ex vivo with PEN-[ADDRESS_1124534] dose albeit to a lesser degree which 
resolved by [CONTACT_283656]. The magnitude of these clinical chemistry changes 
was generally higher after both dosing days in the female compared to male rats which may be 
due to the higher DM1 exposure in the female rats. In dogs, no PEN-221- related effects were 
noted in clinical chemistry parameters.  
Postmortem findings in the rat GLP study were macroscopic findings of small thymus in males and females in the mid - and high-dose PEN-221 groups at the terminal necropsy. Small testes 
were noted in males in the mid - and high-dose PEN-221 groups at the recovery necropsy. In the 
dog GLP study, decreased thymus weights were observed in high dose PEN-221- treated animals.  
Microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], in rats at the terminal necropsy, dose-dependent lymphoid depletion was 
present in the thymus in males and females at all PEN -221 dose levels. This depletion was 
characterized by [CONTACT_812126]. In severe cases, 
only the remaining thymus stroma was present. At the recovery necropsy, lymphoid depletion 
was noted in the thymus in some animals in all dose groups in both sexes and severe lymphoid 
depletion was present in the 1 female at the high dose, which was found dead on Day 29. In the testes, there was seminiferous tubule degeneration/atrophy at the high dose and minimal germ 
cell degeneration at the mid - and high- PEN -221 doses, at the terminal necropsy. Testes findings 
had progressed at the recovery necropsy compared to the terminal necropsy in males at mid and 
high doses. In the kidney, single cell necrosis and/or tubular regeneration was observed in male 
rats at all dose levels and female rats at the mid and high doses at the terminal necropsy, but not 
the recovery necropsy. The rat kidney findings were minimal and reversible and, therefore, considered non-adverse. Bone findings (femur and sternum) were predominantly noted in 
females at the terminal necropsy and were characterized as increased endosteal osteoid 
deposition at the mid  and high doses. Bone findings had progressed at the recovery necropsy 
compared to the terminal necropsy in female rats at mid and high doses . At the recovery 
necropsy, decreased cellularity of the bone marrow was present in t he femur and/or sternum of 
male  and female rats at all PEN -221 dose levels, and increased cellularity was present in the 
bone marrow of the sternum in 1 male at the mid -dose. Also noted was extr amedullary 
hematopoiesis in the liver of females at the mid  and high doses and 1 male at the high dose, and 
in the spleen extramedullary hematopoiesis was observed in males and females at the high dose at the recovery necropsy. The noted microscopic differences that are more marked in the female 
rats may be due to the higher DM1 exposure. In dogs, microscopic findings were observed in the 
kidneys (single cell necrosis, tubular degeneration/necrosis, increased mitotic figures, and/or tubular regeneration) in males and females at all PEN -[ADDRESS_1124535] article, PEN -221, in conscious freely moving beagle dogs. Dose 
levels tested were identical to those used in the dog GLP study. PEN-221, admi nistered as a 
single IV  infusion over 6 minutes to male beagle dogs at dose levels of 0.16, 0.20, and 0.24 
mg/kg, was generally well tolerated and did not produce any clinical observations or mortality. There were no test article -related effects on the QRS duration, electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 
morphology, or tidal volume at any dose level tested. At a dose level of 0.24 mg/kg, from the time of dosing through 1.[ADDRESS_1124536] ically significant 
increases in  blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_812093]  (Leighton 2013; Poon 2013) 
decreases (reflective of the heart rate changes) in the RR, PR, and QT intervals, as well as increases in body temperature that did not reach statistical significance. From [ADDRESS_1124537] dose, slight increases in respi[INVESTIGATOR_812094] 0.24 mg/kg. From 
[ADDRESS_1124538] article treatments. Decreases in the PR and QT intervals were observed beginning at 5 or 12 hours, respectively, following the 0.24 mg/kg treatment, lasting through the 24 hour monitoring 
period. Given the transient nature of the immediate effects observed at 0.24 mg/kg and the 
relatively small magnitude of the sustained effects observed at all dose levels, these changes are not considered to be adverse; intravenous (IV) administration of PEN -221 produced no adverse 
effects on cardiovascular or respi[INVESTIGATOR_812095] 0.24 mg/kg. 
The findings in the PEN- 221 studies identified target organ toxicities consistent with those 
identified in toxicology studies with DM1 or the DM1-containing antibody drug conjugate ado-
trastuzumab emtansine in rats, with maytansine in dogs  (Thake 1975) , and with ado-trastuzumab 
emtansine in cynomolgus monkey s (Leighton 2013; Poon 2013). Notable microscopic findings 
in Sprague-Dawley rats dosed with ado- trastuzuma b emtansine were seen in the liver, thymus, 
kidney, testis, spleen, mesenteric lymph node, femur marrow and sternum marrow (Poon 2013) . 
In rats dosed with DM1, hematologic changes included decreased platelet, reticulocyte and 
lymphocyte counts. DM1 and ado-trastuzumab emtansine related decreases in platelets have 
been observed in preclinical safety studies in rats and monkeys and thrombocytopenia is an adverse reaction to ado -trastuzumab emtansine in humans (KADCYLA
® (ado-trastuzumab 
emtansine) [Package Insert]). Changes in serum chemistry with DM1 dosing in rats reflected adverse effects on the liver:  increases in ALT, AST, and total bilirubin (ado-trastuzumab 
emtansine). In monkeys, ado-trastuzumab emtansine induced changes observed in blood and 
target organs were as n oted in rats  (Poon 2013). Increases in aPTT, fibrinogen, and cholesterol 
were observed in monkeys following dosing with ado-trastuzumab emtansine  (Leighton 2013) . 
Observations were noted in the testes of rats dosed with ado- trastuzumab emtansine.  
Bone marrow to induce ectopic calcification has been observed with potent tubulin-binding 
drugs in rats  (Tamura 1986) . Large doses of vinblastine or colchicine (potent microtubule 
poisons) produced ectopic calcified tissue in the rat bone marrow cavity. Vinblastine sulfate is an 
effective single agent treatment for patients with Hodgkin’s disease and is indicated for the 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1124539] 
potential for adverse effects on bone in humans ( VinBLAStine  Sulfate for Injection USP 
[package insert] ). 
In the PEN -[ADDRESS_1124540] -in-human, open- label, Phase 1 /2a study evaluating  the safety, 
PK, pharmacodynamics, and anti- tumor activity of  PEN -221 in patients with SSTR2 expressing

After provision of written informed consent for the study , patients will be screened for study 
eligibility within 14  days [and within 28 days for tumor assessments by [CONTACT_20420] 
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI )] before the first study drug dose.

5.1.3. Main S tudy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment Period  
Patients who are determined to be eligible, based on s creening assessments, and who have 
provided written informed consent for the study, will begin treatment in the study on Cycle 1 
Day 1 (C1D1; baseline). A treatment cycle is 3 weeks in length. All patients will receive PEN -221 administered IV on Day 1 ever y 3 weeks ; the PEN -221 dose received is dependent on 
the cohort/phase in which the patient is enrolled. During treatment, patients will attend study center visits and have stu dy evaluations performed on D1 of each treatment cycle.  D8 and D15 
visits will also occur , except that, if after initial dosing or an intra -patient dose escalation, if two 
cycles are completed with no Grade [ADDRESS_1124542] to 
Investigator discretion  (see [IP_ADDRESS]) (Except for C1D1, visits during treatment cycles have a 2 -
day window.) All study visits are  anticipated  to be conducted on an out- patient basis, but may be 
conducted on an in -patient basis per institutional policy.  
Safety will be assessed during the study by [CONTACT_122018] (AEs), clinical 
laboratory tests, physical examination, neurological examination, vital sign measurements, 
ECGs, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance st atus (PS).  
Pharmacodynamic (PDc) and s erial blood samples for PK will be collected from all patients.  
All sites of disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_4654]. If the anatomic region cannot be adequately imaged 
by [CONTACT_4654], MRI may be used instead. For SCLC and LCNEC of the lung patients, tumor 
measurements are to be repeated within [ADDRESS_1124543] guidelines, version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009) . Patients who achieve a 
partial response ( PR) or complete response ( CR) by [CONTACT_812129] 6 weeks later (and no sooner than 4 weeks from the prior assessment) 
to confirm the response. Following the confirmatory assessment, the response assessment 
schedule will resume at intervals of every other cycle for SCLC and  LCNEC  patients, and every 
third cycle for all other patients.   
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 49 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 [IP_ADDRESS]. End of Treatment  
Patients who discontinue treatment for any re ason (see Section 7.8) should have an EOT visit. 
The EOT visit should occur within 3 days from the event resulting in treatment discontinuation 
(i.e. disease progression, AE, withdraw consent).  
5.1.4. Follow- up Period  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Follow- Up 
All patients discontinuing treatment or withdrawing from the study will have physical 
examination , laboratory, AE, and concomitant medication assessments performed as part of a 
safety follow -up visit 28 days (±3 days) after their last dose of study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Progression  Follow- Up 
For patients that discontinue treatment for reasons other than radiographic progression of 
disease, tumor assessments should be performed approximately every 6 weeks  from previous 
scan for SCLC and LCNEC of the lung patients and every 9 weeks from previous scan for all 
other patients, or as clinically indicated, until radiographic progression of disease is observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Survival Follow- Up 
Upon disease progression, all patients will be followed approximately every 3 months to assess 
survival status and the date and c ause of death (if known)  will be recorded for patients who died. 
Survival follow-up will occur every [ADDRESS_1124544] to follow-up or consent withdrawal.  
5.1.5. Starting dose 
The PEN -221 selected starting dose of 1.0 mg IV every 3 weeks is based upon international 
guidance for starting dose selection for agents in cancer patients (ICH S9 2010 Guidance for 
Industry). ICH S9 recommends that a starting clinical dose for a first- in-human study should be 
either 1/10th of the severely toxic dose (STD
10) in r odent toxicity studies or 1/6th of the highest 
non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in non-rodent toxicity studies. 
Based on the findings in the 6- week rat repeat dose IV toxicity (PEN -221- TX-006), the STD 10 
for PEN -221 following single or repeat dose administration to rats was determined to be 
1.00 mg/kg. Based on these data,  the dose of one- tenth the rat STD 10 gives a Human Equivalent 
Dose (HED) of 0.016 mg/kg informing the PEN -[ADDRESS_1124545] -in-human starting dose ( Table 4 ). The 
calculation based on the dog HNSTD ( PEN -221- TX-007) is shown in Table 5 and results in a 
higher HED of 0.022 mg/kg substantiating that rat is the more sensitive species. The human 
starting dose of 0.016 mg/kg is equivalent to 0.60 mg/m2 (Table 5 ). A ssuming an average 
weight of [ADDRESS_1124546] selected a starting 
dose of 1.0 mg IV every 3 weeks.  
Based on tumor bearing mouse xenograft studies ( PEN -221- PHARM -023), the minimum 
biologic effective dose in mice is 0.33 mg/kg.  Applying the mouse to human conversion factor of 
12.3 and assuming an average human weight of 60 kg, the human equivalent minimum effective dose is estimated to b e 1.6 mg.

5.1.6. Phase 1 (Dose escalation) 
Phase 1 will employ an adaptive Bayesi an logistic regression model ( BLR M) with [ADDRESS_1124551] 2 patients will 
be assessed for safety and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) for at least 4 weeks (including C2D1 and 
C2D8 assessments) before enrollment in the second cohort may begin. 
The SRC will convene to review all data from the first [ADDRESS_1124552] 3 
weeks (including C2D1 pre-dose assessments) before enrollment o f the next cohort may begin.  
The Safety Review Committee ( SRC) will review the safety and tolerability of PEN -221 of each 
cohort to decide the next dose level to be tested. Statistical modeling will be performed using all safety data and will guide the SRC’s selection of dose levels to be tested. In addition, 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacodynamics ( PDc) data may be used to inform dose selection. 
Dose  escalation increments will be the decision of the SRC. PEN -221 dose cohorts will be 
enrolled sequentially after the SRC reviews safety data collected during C1 (and through C2D8 for Cohort 1) from the patients enrolled in the current dose level. Dose escalation will continue 
until the MTD is determined.  
During Phase 1, if a patient is tolerating PEN -[ADDRESS_1124553] the dose increased to 
a dose that ha s already been established as tolerable by [CONTACT_12217], and with the agreement of the 
SRC.  
The starting dose of PEN-221 is 1.0 mg . The planned dose levels are summarized in Table 6  .

an intermediate dose level . The SRC may be convened earlier at the discretion of the Sponsor if 
important safety issues arise requiring the attention of the committee.  
Toxicities are to be graded by [CONTACT_812132] ( NCI) 
Common Terminology for Cancer Adverse Events ( CTCAE ), version 4.03. 
Although decisions regarding dose escalation will be made based on review of data from C1, safety data will also be collected from all patients continuing treatment and this will be reviewed 
periodically by [CONTACT_12217]. Any detected cumulative toxicity may require later dose reductions or 
other action as appropriate, including further refinement of the RP2D. 
5.1.7. Phase 2a 
In Phase 2a , PEN -221 will be evaluated using the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) identified 
by [CONTACT_12217].  
Phase 2a may begin once a RP2D is identified in Phase [ADDRESS_1124555] been 
treated at this new dose to review the data and confirm whether  subsequent patients be enrolled 
into the study at this new dose.  
In addition, at any time during Phase 2a, the BLRM may be re-run to confirm the estimated 
MTD and verify that the dose under study still satisfies the overdose criterion. If the dose fails to 
satisfy the criterion a change to the dose under study may be decided by [CONTACT_12217], guided by [CONTACT_812133], after review of the clinical data. The SRC decision to change 
dose may also be spurred by [CONTACT_812113] (e.g. frequency of lower 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 53 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 grade AEs or events in later treatment cycles). Subsequent patients may then be enrolled at thi s 
new dose until at least 6 patients are treated at this new dose level and upon SRC review of the 
data, the SRC will decide whether the new dose level is appropriate for continued study. 
5.2. Justification for the Study Design  
Goals of Phase 1 oncology studies include estimation of the  MTD  and initial assessment of  
safety and tolerability of a study drug, determination of a recommended range of doses for evaluation in future clinical studies  (Ahn 1998; Dillman 1992; Gatsonis 1992; International 
Conference on Harmonization 1997), and an initial characterization of the PK profile in humans. The objectives of the current study are consistent with those typi[INVESTIGATOR_380723] [ADDRESS_1124556] been defined.  
The primary objective of the dose escalation phase of the study is to determine the MTD. Dose 
escalation will be guided by [CONTACT_812134]. The use of 
BLRMs  for Phase 1 studies has been advocated by [CONTACT_3558] ( EMA ) and 
by (Rogatko  2007) . This design uses all accumulating toxicity data to assign enrolling patients to 
escalating  doses of study drug, while controlling the risk of excessive toxicity. 
Once the MTD  and RP2D has been determined, the study will proceed in to Phase 2.  
The primary  objective of Phase [ADDRESS_1124557] udy 
should be halted, then study termination can occur only after appropriate consultation between 
the Sponsor and Investigators. Conditions that may warrant study or study center termination include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of any unexpected , significant, or unacceptable risk to the patients 
enrolled in the study. 
• Failure of the Investigator to enter patients at an acceptable rate.  
• Insufficient adherence to the protocol requirements.  
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of study drug. 
Should the study be closed prematurely, all study materials (study drug, etc.) must be returned to the Sponsor or designee (or disposed of after consultation with the Sponsor or designee, as 
directed by [CONTACT_282871]).

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 5.4. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
PEN -[ADDRESS_1124558] likely to benefit from the study medication, namely, those with advanced cancers that 
overexpress  SSTR2.  These cancers  include gastroenteropancreatic and  lung and thymus NETs, 
NETs of unknown primary, SCLC and LCNEC of the lung, and other tumors of neuroendocrine 
origin, namely, paraganglioma, pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, Merkel cell  
carcinoma, and high grade extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). The somatostatin 
receptor is known to be overexpressed in the majority of NETs, and approximately 40% of 
SCLC  (Hofland 2001; Lehman 2015; Mato 1998; O'By[CONTACT_7943] 1994; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_569201] 2009; Wangberg 1997).  
Effective treatment options for patients with these cancers in the advanced setting are extremely limited and new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_132384].  To improve the possibility that patients enrolled 
in this Phase 1/2a study might benefit from PEN -221, patients must meet eligibility criteria that 
include tumor expression of SSTR2 as assessed by a noninvasive, approved imaging modality. 
The primary objective of the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of this Phase 1/2a study is to 
investigate the safety and tolerability and determine the m aximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
PEN -221. The nonclinical toxicology studies have not identified any risks that would preclude 
investigation of PEN-[ADDRESS_1124559] cancer  (Poon 2013; Verma 2012)  and other antibody- drug conjugates in early phase 
development (Amiri -Kordestani 2014; Galsky 2008; Rodon 2008; Shah 2016). 
The Phase [ADDRESS_1124560] been assessed for safety and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) for at least 4 weeks (up until C2D8), enrollment in the second cohort may begin. 
Dose escalation will be guided by [CONTACT_812134]. The use of 
BLRMs  for Phase 1 studies has been advocated by [CONTACT_3558] (EMA) 
(Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 2006) and by [CONTACT_540896] (2007) . This 
design uses all accumulating toxicity data to assign enrolling patients to doses that h ave a higher 
chance of targeted toxicity (close to the MTD), while controlling the risk of excessive toxicity.  
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1124561] the dose increased 
to a dose that has already been established as tolerable by [CONTACT_12217], and with the agreement of the SRC. This intra- patient dose escalation  may allow patients a greater possibility of benefit 
from treatment with PE N-221 than might be achieved at the starting dose in his/her assigned 
dose cohort. 
Risks specific to patients who have provided written informed consent to undergo an optional 
tumor biopsy during s creening include pain and tenderness at the tumor biopsy site and potential 
bleeding complications, which will be minimized by  [CONTACT_812135] a t least [ADDRESS_1124562] agree to use highly effective 
contraception (as defined in inclusion criterio n 6) prior to study entry and for the duration of 
study participation.  Women must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment. It is 
unknown whether the drug is excreted in human milk, and women who are breast feeding are 
excluded from the study. 
The study design for this first in human Phase 1/2a dose escalation/expansion study of PEN -221 
aims to minimize potential risks and offer the potential to benefit patients whose tumors 
overexpress the SSTR2 target of this anticancer agent. Alt hough the potential benefits to patients 
are unknown at this time, nonclinical data demonstrate e vidence of  potent anti- tumor activity in 
tumor models that overexpress SSTR2. The benefit/risk as sessment for this Phase [ADDRESS_1124563] 6 patients will be treated at the MTD.  
7.1.2. Phase 2 a 
Approximately 75 patients will be enrolled as follows: gastrointestional mid -gut NET  (n=35, 25 
PRRT -naïve, 10  PRRT recurrent ), pancreatic NET  (n=20), and SCLC  (n=20). These cohort 
sample sizes are considered sufficient to obtain an early assessment of efficacy of PEN -[ADDRESS_1124564], of their free will, give fully considered, written informed consent to those assessments or 
modifications . Consent is not considered given simply by [CONTACT_812136]. 
The patient’s medical record must also clearly indicate that the Investigator, or a qualified health care provider under the direction and designation of the Investigator, had a comprehensive discussion with the patient about the risks, benefits, and responsibilities of participation, ensuring 
the patient understood the contents of the informed consent form ( ICF), and offering the patient 
sufficient time to consider details an d discuss with others if they desire. 
In the event that the partner of a patient becomes pregnant, the partner must provide voluntary, fully considered, written informed consent to the use of any information collected about them, 
the fetus, or any resulting birth before such information can be collected or used in the study. 
7.3. Patient  Inclusion Criteria

7.7. Patient Identification and Enrollment  
To ensure accurate and timely monitoring of patient enrollment, the following procedures will be implemented: 
• Patients who are candidates for enrollment into the study will be assigned a sequential 
and unique patient number by [CONTACT_812138] S creening phase. Once a patient number has been assigned, 
it cannot be reused. 
• Patients who have provided written informed consent will be evaluated for eligibility by [CONTACT_812139] (see Section  7.2 and Section  7.4) 
have been satisfied and that the patient is eligible for participation in this clinical study. 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 64 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 • The Investigator or the Investigator’s research staff will provide eligibility 
information to the Medical Monitor. 
• Patients who are enrolled but not treated will be replaced . Furthermore, during Phase 
1, patients who discontinue from the study before completing C1 for reasons other than DLT will be replaced.  
• Investigators will be notified by [CONTACT_812140] a given dose cohort / study phase is closed and enrollment into the next dose cohort / study phase can begin . Investigators will be consulted in all dose escalation  decisions. 
• Investigators will be notified by [CONTACT_812141], when it is completed, or is closed to further patient enrollment. 
7.8. Patient  Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients may  withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, without prejudice to their 
medical care. The Investigator also has the right to discontinue treatment with PEN -221 or  
withdraw patients from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Progression of disease 
• AE 
• Life threatening  or other unacceptab le toxicity  
• PEN -221 cycle delay for > 3 weeks  due to study drug- related toxicity  
• Patient requires use of a prohibited concomitant medication or therapy  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition unacceptable for further treatment within the stu dy parameters, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] 
• Severe n on-compliance  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Patient withdrawal of consent  
• A decision to modify or discontinue development of the drug 
The EOT visit is to be completed within 3 days from the event resulting in treatment discontinuation (e.g., disease progression, AE, consent withdrawal, etc.). A Safety Follow up 
visit is to be completed [ADDRESS_1124581] study drug dose. End of study (EOS) occurs when 
the patient is no longer being followed up for progression or survival (i.e. death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent). The primary reason for a patient’s discontinuation from treatment and withdrawal from the study is to be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  
7.9. Withdrawal of Consent for Use of Donated Samples  
Patients may withdraw consent for use of any tissue, fluid, or other biological samples they provide, without prejudice to their medical care, and without necessarily having to withdraw from the whole study. 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1124582] be withdrawn from the 
study if the SRC determines  it is in the patient’s best interest.  
7.11. Safety Review Committee  
The SRC will consist of the Medical Monitor, who will chair the committee, and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_812096].  The study statistician will participate in 
the SRC during Phase 1. Ad hoc  participants such as the clinical pharmacology scientist, and 
clinical operations leader may be invited as appropriate. Additional experts may be consulted by [CONTACT_812142]. The SRC Charter  for this st udy will define the exact membership and who 
should be present for decisions to be made. 
The SRC has the responsibility for monitoring the clinical study’s progress and the safety of the 
participating patients. After there are at least [ADDRESS_1124583] cohort and 3 
evaluable patients  for subsequent cohorts at each dose level during Phase 1  of the study, the SRC 
will review and assess all available safety data from the cohort together with available PK data and recommendations from the BLRM to make a decision on the dose for the next cohort of patients.  The decision may be to: 
• Proceed with dose escalation  
• Expand the cohort to a maximum of 6 evaluable patients 
• De-escalate the dose to a lower dose level (up to a maximum of 6 evaluable patients) 
or to an intermediate lower dose level  
• Stop the dos e escalation  
When there are other patients that are ongoing at the time of this review, the SRC may decide to defer their decision until these further patients become evaluable. 
Any patient started on treatment in error, i.e., he or she failed to comply with all of the selection 
criteria but meets the criteria of an evaluable patient, will be reviewed on a case by [CONTACT_812143], Inc Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1124584] of clinical and laboratory evaluations as 
outlined in the protocol. 
7.13. Patient  Adherence to Protocol Schedule  
All patients are required to adhere to the protocol-specified visit schedule. 
Permissible visit windows are specified in Table 2  and Table 3. Visit windows may be 
lengthened for administrative reasons (e.g., holidays ) after consultation with the Medical 
Monitor. On D1 of each cycle (i.e., study drug administration days), patients are to present to the study 
center , ideally  within approximately 2 hours before study drug administration for pre- treatment 
assessments. 
Additional study center visits may be scheduled, as deemed necessary based on the patient’s 
clinical status . 
An EOT vis it should be conducted within 3 days  of the event resulti ng in treatment 
discontinuation. A Safety Follow -up visit should be conducted 28 days (± 3 days) after the last 
dose of study drug. Progression follow-up visits will occur until objective disease prog ression. 
Following disease progression, survival follow-up will occur every [ADDRESS_1124585] posterior probability of the DLT rate falling in the target toxicity 
interval [0.16, 0.33) among the doses fulfilling the EWOC criteria. Per EWOC it should 
be unlikely (<25% posterior probability) that the DLT rate at the dose will exceed 0.33. 
5. After repeating the preceding steps, the MTD is declared when at least [ADDRESS_1124586] 
been evaluated at the dose level recommended by [CONTACT_111831], and either of the following 
conditions is met:  
a. The posterior probability of targeted toxicity is at least 6 0% for this, or 
b. A minimum of [ADDRESS_1124587] already been treated in the study . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Selection Process  
At the end of each treatment cohort, the SRC will convene for a dose escalation teleconference. The clinical course for each patient in the current d ose cohort will be presented and discussed in 
detail. Updated safety data on other ongoing patients, including data in later cycles, will be discussed as well.  
All available toxicity information, PK, PD c, and anti- tumor activity information, as well as 
recommendations from the BLRM will be evaluated by [CONTACT_812144] a determine the dose regimen for the next cohort. The SRC must reach a consensus on whether to declare MTD, escalate the dose any further, or whether to de- escalate and/or expand recr uitment into 
particular cohorts.  
Dose levels presented in Table [ADDRESS_1124588] exceeded the MTD.  
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 70 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 8.6.2. Phase 2a 
The RP2D will be the decision of the SRC and will be based on the findings of the safety, 
tolerability, PK, and PDc profile of PEN-221 during Phase 1. The RP2D may be re -evaluated by 
[CONTACT_812145] 1. See section 8.10.  
8.7. Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
A dose- limiting toxicity ( DLT ) is defined as any toxicity occu rring within the first four weeks 
(i.e., up until C2D8) for patients in Cohort [ADDRESS_1124589] three weeks (i.e., up until C2D1) for patients in subsequent cohorts that is not related to the underlying disease, disease 
progression, intercurrent illn ess, or concomitant medications, and that meets any of the following 
criteria:  
1. Hematological toxicity:  
Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500 cells/mm
3) lasting longer than 4 consecutive days 
Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/mm3) of any duration associated with 
fever  ≥ 38.5°C or systemic infection  
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (< 25,000/mm3) or Grade 3 thromobcytopenia (25,000 to 
<50,000/mm3) associated with bleeding  
2. Non-hematological toxicity ≥ CTCAE Grade 3 including:  
QTc prolongation (> 500 msec) 
Grade [ADDRESS_1124590] ≥  3× ULN and concomitant total bilirubin ≥  2× ULN  
Refer to  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , for more  detailed information about the review, assessment and 
reporting of cases that meet the criteria for potential Hy’s Law.  
3. Any other toxicity that:  
Is greater than that at baseline, is clinically significant and/or unacceptable, does not 
respond to supportive care, results in a disruption of PEN-221 dosing schedule of more than 2 weeks and/or is judged to be a DLT by [CONTACT_12217] 
A DLT excludes:  
1. Isolated laboratory changes of any grade without clinical sequelae or clinical significance with the exception of those laboratory changes outlined above 
2. Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or dehydration that resolves to < Grade 3 within 48 hours of initiating supportive car e treatment specified in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] 
3. Grade 3 fever (in the absence of neutropenia), or fatigue that resolves to < Grade 3 within 72 hours.

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 8.8. Definition and Estimation of Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the highest drug dosage not expected to cause dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) in more than 33% of the treated patients in the first 3 weeks  of PEN -221 
treatment  (or in the first 4 weeks of PEN-221 treatment for Cohort 1 onl y). 
A 2-parameter (BLRM) in conjunction with EWOC  (Babb 1998; Neuenschwander 2008)  will be 
used during the escalation phase to guide the selection of doses to investigate and for estimation 
of the MTD. 
The general plan is that cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of PEN-[ADDRESS_1124591] of newly enrolled patients.  
Estimation of the MTD will be based upon the estimation of the probability of DLT in C1 in patients in the dose- determining set (DDS). Details are described in  Section  15. 
8.9. Definition of Evaluable Patient  
An evaluable patient is defined as a patient that has received PEN -221 and either: 
• has completed minimum safety evaluation requirements during the first 21- day cycle , 
or 
• has experienced a DLT during the first 21 day cycle. 
8.10. Definition of Recommended Phase 2 Dose  
The RP2D may be equal to or below the MTD. The RP2D will be determined by [CONTACT_812146] 1 , and, if 
appropriate, the early experience in Phase 2a. Additionally, observations related to PK, and any 
cumulative toxicity observed after multiple cycles may be included in the rationale supporting 
the RP2D. 
8.11. Dose Modifications  
All patients will receive PEN -221 at the prescribed dose in C1. After C1, if, in the Investigator’s 
judgment, a patient experiences a clinical significant and/or unacceptable toxicity including a 
DLT not attributable to the disease or disease- related processes under investi gation, dosing will 
be delayed and/or the subsequent dose will be reduced, and supportive therapy will be 
administered as required.  Dose adjustments will be based on the organ system exhibiting the 
greatest degree of toxicity.  
For individual patients, trea tment for each new cycle will be delayed if the scheduled off -drug 
periods are not adequate to allow for recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or the baseline  status of the patient; 
with the exception of fatigue, anorexia, and ALT and/or AST elevation that must have recov ered 
to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_1124592] demonstrated an acceptable response to dose interruption may re-start at either the provisional Cohort − [ADDRESS_1124593] 2 cycles of PEN -221 administered at the higher dose level. 
Dose modification for toxicity will proceed according to guidelines detailed in Section  8.11.2 
and Section  8.11.3. 
8.11.2. Dose Modifications for Hematological Toxicities  
Complete blood counts (CBC) will be monitored prior to treatment of each dose of PEN-221 and at regular intervals throughout the study (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). If hematologic al toxicity occurs, 
treatment should be held, and ANC, platelets  and hemoglobin should be monitored at least 
weekly until recovery . 
Hematologic al toxicities are to be treated as medically indicated. In addition, the measures listed 
in Table 7  are recommended.

QTcF >  470 to ≤  500 upon repeat testing, discontinue treatment. 
If QTcF >  500 msec on the average of 3 consecutive readings taken at any time point during 
study, discontinue treatment. [IP_ADDRESS]. Infusion -related Reactions, Hypersensi tivity Reactions  
Mild to moderate infusion-related reactions (i.e., NCI CTCAE Grades 1 and 2 and infusion 
reactions that do not involve symptoms of anaphylaxis) should be managed with temporary interruption of the infusion and medical management of symptoms, as per institutional 
guidelines. After all symptoms have resolved, re-challenge with a reduced infusion rate and 
additional premedication is permitted.  
Severe infusion- related reactions (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or higher) or reactions with any features 
of anaphylaxis require immediat e discontinuation of the study drug infusion, immediate 
treatment with  epi[INVESTIGATOR_812097]. Following a severe infusion- related reaction or suspected anaphylaxis, re- challenge 
with PEN -221 is not permitted; therefore, the patient must permanently discontinue study 
treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Non -hematologic Toxicities 
For all other Grade 3 – 4 toxicities  other than those described above, delay treatment with PEN-
221 (max up to 3 weeks) until resolved to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_1124600] dose 
level.  
If Grade 3 – 4 toxicity recurs, permanently discontinue treatment.  
For all other Grade <3 toxicity, decision to delay PEN-221 for a maximum of 3 weeks is at the Investigator’s discretion. PEN -[ADDRESS_1124601] dose level

8.12. Concomitant Medications  
All prescription and non-prescription medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including pharmacologic doses 
of vitamins, herbal medicines, or other non-traditional medicines, taken from [ADDRESS_1124602] be recorded.  
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 76 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 8.12.1. Prohibited  Medications  
The following medications and treatments are prohibited during study participation. 
• Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, and voriconazole). DM1, the cytotoxic component of PEN-221, is metabolized in vitro mainly by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]3A5 
[(KADCYL A
® (ado -trastuzumab emtansine) package insert, Genentech , Inc., South 
San Francisco, CA] . Therefore, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is 
prohibited due to the potential for an increase in DM1 exposure and to xicity.  The use 
of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (EMEND®), a substrate, moderate inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4, is 
NOT permitted . 
• Any investigational agent or device other than PEN -221, including agents that are 
commercially available for indications other than the patient’s solid tumor that are 
under investigation for the treatment of solid tumors. 
• Any radiotherapy, chemotherapy, anti- neoplastic treatment s or investigational agents  
other than study drug. Radiation  for palliation at focal sites may be permitted  after 
discussion between the Investigator and Medical Monitor. 
• Live virus and bacterial vaccines should not be administered, e.g ., yellow fever, 
measles, influenza, rubella, mumps, typhoid, mycobacterium tuberculosis (BCG), Yersinia pestis (EV).  An increased risk of infection by [CONTACT_812147] a nd the effects with 
PEN -221 are unknown. The administration of killed vaccines is allowed. Examples of 
killed vaccines are cholera, bubonic plague, polio vaccine, hepatitis A and rabies. 
Other medication s, other than those described above, which are cons idered necessary for the 
patient’s safety and well -being, may be given at the discretion of the Investigator and recorded in 
the appropriate sections of the e CRF.  
8.12.2. Medications to be Used with Caution  
The following medications should be used with caution during study participation: 
• Anti -hyperglycemic medications : Somatostatin analogs inhibit the secretion of 
insulin and glucagon, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Due to the similarity between somatostatin and the peptide component of PEN-221, dose 
adjustments of concomitant antihyperglycemic medications may be necessary in 
patients being treated with PEN -221. 
• Bradycardia -inducing drugs:  Concomitant administration of bradycardia-inducing 
drugs (e.g., beta-blockers) may have an additive effect on the reduction of heart rate associated with somatostatin analog s. Due to the similarity between somatostatin and 
the peptide component of PEN-221, dose adjustments of concomitant bradycardia-inducing drugs may be necessary in patients being treated with PEN -221. 
• Orally administered medications: Somatostatin analog s may reduce the intestinal 
absorption of concomitant medications. Due to the similarity between somatostatin 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 77 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 and the peptide component of PEN-221, there is a possibility that PEN- 221 may 
reduce the intestinal absorption of concomitant medications . 
8.12.3. Permitted Medications  
Patients are permitted to receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_592743]: 
• Nausea/vomiting : Anti -emetic treatment such as with 5- HT [ADDRESS_1124603] cycle of PEN -221. The use of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 
(EMEND
®), a substrate, moderate inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4, is NOT 
permitted . 
• Diarrhea : Diarrh ea should be treated promptly with appropriate supportive care, 
including administration of an anti- diarrheal agent according to standard practice 
guidelines. Anti-diarrheal agents should not be taken prophylactically. Patients should be instructed to begin taking anti-diarrheal medication at the first sign of: 1) poorly formed or loose stool, 2) occurrence of more bowel movements than usual in 1 day, 
or 3) unusually high volume of stool. Anti-diarrheal agents should be deferred if 
blood or mucus is pr esent in the stool or if diarrh ea is accompanied by [CONTACT_411]. In this 
setting, appropriate diagnostic microbiologic specimens should be obt ained to 
exclude an infectious etiology. Patients should also be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids to help prevent dehydration. 
• Constipation:  Contipation may  be treated with stool softeners or lubricants. Use of 
osmotics  is allowed  with careful monitoring of electrolytes.  
• Anemia:  Transfusions and/or erythropoietin may be used as clinically indicated for 
the treatment of anemia, but shoul d be clearly noted as concomitant  medications. 
Patients already receiving erythropoietin at the time of screening for the study may continue it providing they have been receiving it for more than 1 month at the time study treatment is started.  Prophylactic erythropoietin should not be started during C1 
of the study, but may be started during C2 and thereafter.  
• Neutropenia:  Patients who experience G rade 4 neutropenia lasting for ≥ 5 days; 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia with oral temper ature ≥ 38.5°C; or infection with Grade 3/[ADDRESS_1124604] cycle of PEN -221 therapy. 
• Somatostatin analogs: Agents such as octr eotide, lanreotide, pasireotide, and other 
somatostatin analogs  are permitted if their use is providing benefit in controlling 
carcinoid symptoms. 
Medications and treatments other than those specified in Section  8.12.1, including palliative and 
supportive care for disease-related symptoms, are permitted during the study , as appropriate.  
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1124605] PEN -221 dose. 
The medical history is to include cancer history, including the patient’s primary tumor type, 
current disease stage, date of and disease stage at diagnosis, method of diagnosis, and all 
previous treatments, including systemic therapy, radiation therapy, and surgeries, as well as response to such treatments. 
Each patient’s history of somatostatin analog treatment (start and stop dates, agents, doses), and 
results of any somatostatin analog imaging will be collected.  
As part of the patient’s cancer history, study centers are to submit a local histology or cytology 
report obtained prior to enrollment, if available. Furthermore, paraffin blocks (preferred) or a 
minimum of 10 unstained slides of available archival tumor tissue are to be requested from the patient’s local institution and collected , if available. 
9.2. Somatostatin Analog Radioisotope Imaging  
Those patients who do not have documented results of a historically  positive SARI obtained 
within [ADDRESS_1124606] be performed using only SARI with regional  
marketing authorization to be used for detection and localization of somatostatin -receptor -
positive tumors. If multiple kits with marketing authorization are available, any method may be 
used at the discretion of the Investigator. Patients with documentation of a historically positive 
SARI (by 
111In, 68Ga, 99mTc, or other radioisotope linked to a somatostatin analog) within 180 
days of C1D1 to be considered positive for SSTR2 expression, and will not be required to receive SARI during pre -screening in  this study.  
The current state of neuroendocrine tumor imaging has recently been reviewed by  [CONTACT_812148] 
(2015).  
9.2.1. Indium -labeled SARI  
Octreoscan
™ Kit for the Preparation of Indium In 111 Pentetreotide (pentetreotide scanning) 
(Mallinc krodt Nuclear Medicine LLC, Maryland Heights MO [LOCATION_003]) comprises 2 parts: a 10 ml 
reaction vial and a 10 ml vial of 111In chloride (Mallinckrodt 2015). T he imaging agent is 
prepared within 6 h prior to use by [CONTACT_812149] 
111In pentetreotide. At time of calibration, the kit contains 111 MBq/ml (3.0 
mCi/ml) 111In, with a half-life of 2.8 d. 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 79 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 The scan should be performed according to institutional guidelines and manufacturer 
instructions. FOCBP should be tested for pregnancy and excluded if pregnant. Additional 
practice guidelines should also be reviewed  (Balon 2011) . Immediately prior to use, labeling 
yield must be determined  according to package directions. The evening prior to 111In 
pentetreotide admi nistration, a mild lax ative such as bisacodyl or lactulose should be given and 
continued for 48 h. Both prior to and after administration, patients should be well hydrated, and should be encouraged to drink fluids liberally to reduce radiation dose by [CONTACT_812150]. Although imaging can be 
performed by [CONTACT_812151] -photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) cameras, 
only SPECT imaging should be used for scans performed in this study due to its  3-dimensional 
capabilities,  superior sensitivity , and ability to more precisely allow tumor localization for 
possible comparision with CT or MRI scans.  The recommended radiation dose for SPECT 
imaging is 222 MBq (6.0) mCi of 
111In pentetreotide, and the expected effective dose equivalent 
is [ADDRESS_1124607] practice for imag ing time points . 
Scans are to be scored in relation  to non- diseased areas of liver as described by [CONTACT_812152] 
(2005) and listed in  Table 8 . 
Table 8: Octreoscan SSTR2 Scoring  
Score  Description  
[ADDRESS_1124608] a positive Octreoscan if their score from Table 8  is 3 
or 4. 
According to the manufacturer  (Mallinckrodt 2015) , the hormonal effect of 111In pentetreotide is 
1/[ADDRESS_1124609] before and during administration in patients suspected of 
having an insulinoma. 
In a clinical study, 83 of 87 patients (95%) who received octreotide therapy within 72 h of 111In 
pentetreotide were successfully imaged. Nevertheless, imaging sensitivity may be reduced in 
patients concurrently receiving therapeutic doses of short -acting s omatostatin therapy, so this 
should be considered in timing 111In pentetreotide administration . 
As 111In pentetreotide is eliminated primarily by [CONTACT_8212], use in patients with renal 
impairment should be considered carefully. 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 80 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019  
Adverse reactio ns associated with 111In pentetreotide (<1% in clinical trials of 538 patients) 
included dizziness, fever, flush, headache, hypotension, changes in liver enzymes, joint pain, 
nausea, sweating, weakness, a single case of bradycardia, and a single case of decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit . 
9.2.2. Gallium -labeled SARI  
SARI with 
68Ga derivatives of somatostatin analogs has been practiced since at least 2001  
(Hofmann 2001). 68Ga-DOTATATE  and 68Ga-DOTATOC are commonly used. Compared with 
PEN -221, they have the following affinity profiles (half- maximal inhibitory concentrations) to 
various human somatostatin receptors ( Table 9):

68Ga is produced from a cyclotron, or collected from a Ge- Ga generator.  It is then combined with 
somatostatin analogs, for example, as described by [CONTACT_812153] (2014). The resulting imaging 
agent is administered to patients and, almost immediately thereafter, imaged using concurrent positron emission tomography (PET) and CT. 
Lesions can be assigned standardized uptake values; however, a patient can be classified as 
positive overall using the scheme outlined in Table 8 . 
9.3. Safety  Assessments  
9.3.1. Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations are to be performed at the time points designated in Table 2 and Table 3. Complete physical examinations include assessment of the following:

• Skin 
• Psychiatric  
• Neurological : 
A thorough neurological assessment must be performed  as part of the complete 
physical exam at the ti me points designated in Table 2 and Table 3  as microtubule 
disrupting agents including DM1 may be associated with sensory and/or motor 
peripheral neuropathies and these effects may be cumulative with dose. 
Neurological assessments should include questioning regarding whether the patient is 
experiencing any numbness , tingling , burning, or pain, or any sensation of weakness  
or difficulty performing  daily activities. Exam to include  light touch, sharp touch 
[skin prick], temperature, proprioception, and vibration sensation testing , as well as 
testing of deep tendon reflexes. Additional neurological assessments are to be 
performed as appropriate for the patient’s condition, at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Symptom- directed ( i.e., abbreviated) physical examinations are to  be conducted at all other study 
visits.  
On dosing days, physical examinations should be completed prior to infusion. Abnormal 
physical examination findings that are considered by [CONTACT_812154] a particular patient during s creening  and before dosing on C1D1 are to be reported as part of 
the patient’s medical history . Abnormal, clinically significant examination findings following 
initiation of dosing on C1D1 are to be reported as an AE, if the finding represents a change from baseline. 
9.3.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and  body temperature, are to be 
measured at the time points designated in Table 2  and Table 3.  
During s creening, p ulse rate and blood pressure will be measured across 3 positions: supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
sitting and standing, after at least [ADDRESS_1124610].  
On C1D1 and D1 of subsequent cycles (dosing days), vital signs are to be measured prior to the

9.3.4. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG , measuring rhythm, QT, QRS, PR, and R- R intervals,  is to be collected with the 
patient lying face -up at the time points designated in Table 2 and Table 3. Triplicate  ECGs are to 
be collected  approximately 5 minutes apart at all time  points. On C1D1 (and during Phase 1 
only, also on C3D1 ), ECGs ar e to be performed immediately prior to the start of study drug 
infusion, at 30 minutes after the start of the infusion, (±5 minutes),  at the end of infusion (±5 
minutes), and at all scheduled PK time  points thereafter; the date and time of each ECG start and 
stop are to be documented. On all other dosing days, ECGs should be performed immediately 
prior to infusion and at end of infusion (±5 minutes).  ECGs should be performed after the PK 
and glucose monitoring. 
The Investigator or designated physician will review all ECGs and see that any significant 
abnormalities are under appropriate management.  
9.3.5. Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory assessments for hematology, clinical chemistries, coagulation studies, urinalysis and 
pregnancy testing will be performed by [CONTACT_12357]. 
Abnormal, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are to be reported as AEs, if the findings represent a change from baseline.

other than radiographic progression of disease will be followed for disease progression 
(Progression follow-up). SCLC and LCNEC of the lung patient s will be followed approximately 
every [ADDRESS_1124621] tumor assessment, or as clinically 
indicated . Upon disease progression, all patients will be followed approximately every 3 months 
from the date of progression to assess survival status and the date and cause of death (if known) 
will be recorded for patients who died. 
All sites of disease should be imaged by [CONTACT_462] . Subsequent assessments should use the 
same radiographic methods as used during s creening. Anatomical measurements (summed across 
target lesi ons) will be documented during screening and each subsequent evaluation. When 
possible, the same qualified physician will interpret results to reduce variability . Radiographic

Measurable versus non -measurable 
• Measurable: lesions that could accurately be measured in at least 1 dimension as 
≥[ADDRESS_1124623] scan or caliper measurement by [CONTACT_385491] ≥ [ADDRESS_1124624] X -ray; the longest diameter is to be recorded.  For malign ant lymph nodes, a 
node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_1124625] scan  
• Non-measurable: all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm 
or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) and truly non-
measurable lesions.  
Target versus  non-target 
• Target: all measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs, are to be identified as target lesions and 
measured and recorded at s creening. Target lesions are to be selected on the basis of 
their size (i.e., those with the longest diameter) and suitability for accurate repeated 
measurement. The sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions is to be calculated 
and recorded in the eCRF as the baseline sum longest diameter .

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 10. ADVERSE EVENT  DEFINITIONS, RECORDING, AND 
REPORTING  
10.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
10.1.1. Adverse Event s 
Adverse event (AE) means  any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug- related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, and does not imply any judgment about causality . 
For the purposes of this study, death and disease progression (i.e., PD) are not considered AEs and should not be reported as such. Death is considered an outcome of 1 or more primary AEs, and PD is considered a worsening of underlying disease and is a criterion for study dru g 
discontinuation. Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as AEs during the study.  
10.1.2. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the current 
Investigator Brochure  or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
"Unexpected" also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
Investigator Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation. 
10.1.3. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investigat or or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death.  
• A life -threatening  AE. Life-threatening means that , in the view of either the 
Investigator or the Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death . It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but 
planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
Additional exclusions to serious adverse event ( SAE ) reporting include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
o Elective procedures.  
o Social/administrative reasons in the absence of an AE.  
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 93 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 o Expected deterioration caused by [CONTACT_4002]. 
• A persistent or significant disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• An important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812101] , based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in thi s for SAEs . Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intens ive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
All SAEs that occur  after signing of study-related informed consent, whether or not the SAEs  are 
related to the study drug, must be reported. (As stated in Section  10.1.1, only PD with an 
outcome of death is to be reported as an SAE.)  
If an Investigator learns of any SAEs, including death, at any time after a patient has completed 
the study and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is related to PEN -
221, the Investigator should notify the Spo nsor. 
10.2. Adverse Event Assessment  
10.2.1. Intensity  
The intensity of each AE is to be assessed by [CONTACT_118554], Version 4.03 (see http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-
14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf). 
10.2.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator  will assess causal relationship between PEN -221 and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ 
or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’ 
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures F or 
SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal r elationship is implied as 
‘yes’.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events B ased on S igns and Symptoms  
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_812159].  When 
collecting AEs, the recording of a diagnosis is preferred (when possible) to the recording of a list 
of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.  
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 94 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 [IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events B ased on Examinations and T ests 
 
Abnormal, clinically significant laboratory results are to be reported as  an AE and must be 
recorded in the patient’s source documents and in the eCRF if the findings represent a change 
from baseline. If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be re ported as an AE and the associated laboratory 
result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting 
Investigator uses the clinical rather than the laboratory term (e.g. anemia versus low hemoglobin 
value).  In the a bsence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AEs.  
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE. 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as 
compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hy’s Law 
The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law  
criteria at any time during the study.  Potential Hy’s Law criteria are defined as AST  or ALT  ≥ 3× 
upper limit of normal (ULN) to gether with total bilirubin ≥ 2×  ULN, irrespective of an increase 
in ALP, at any point during the study following the start of study medication.  
When a case meeting potential Hy’s Law is identified, the Investigator will notify the Medical Monitor. The Investigator will also request a new blood draw to repeat the test immediatel y and 
will review all previous laboratory data to det ermine whether potential Hy’s Law criteria were 
met at any study visit prior to or after starting study treatment.  
The Investigator will review the case with the Medical Monitor and agree on the approach for the 
patients’ follow -up assessments, which include monitoring the patient until liver chemistry tests 
and clinical signs and symptoms return to normal or baseline levels, and investigating the 
etiology of the event including diagnostic tests, as appropriate. The SRC and other subject  matter 
experts may also be involved in the case review and assessment, as needed. Within 3 weeks of detection of the initial laboratory abnormality the Investigator and Medical Monitor will review all available data and agree upon whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting potential Hy’s Law criteria other than drug induced liver injury caused by [CONTACT_5257]. 
Hy’s Law is defined AST or ALT ≥  3× ULN  together with total bilirubin ≥  2× ULN, where no 
explanation can be found other than drug induced liver injury caused by [CONTACT_5257]. For 
potential Hy’s Law and Hy’s Law, the elevation in transaminases precedes or is concurrent with 
the elevation in total bilirubin, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and total bilirubin occur  (FDA 2009) . 
Standard safety reporting procedures will be followed for reporting AEs  and SAE s according to 
the outcome of the review and assessment. If it is agreed that there is no alternative explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and total bilirubin elevations other than the study drug, then 
the Investigator is required to report an SAE with the term Hy’s Law and the causality 
assessment of related.  
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 95 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 If there is a delay of over 3 weeks  in obtaining the information needed to assess whether the case 
meets Hy’s Law criteria then the event should be reported as an SAE with the report term 
potential Hy’s Law and the causality assessment of r elated, until such time as a re assessment and 
informed decision is made and the SAE report updated accordingly.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Disease Progression  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to the disease for which the IP is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease 
under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of new, or 
progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study  should be considered as 
disease progression and not an AE. Events that  are unequivocally due to disease progression 
should not be reported as AEs during the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. New C ancers  
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE a nd will generally meet at least [ADDRESS_1124628] been identified after the patient’s 
inclusion in this study. They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the study, or within the follow-up period after the administration of the last dose of investigational product, should be reported as follows: 
• Death, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should be communicated to 
the study monitor at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the CRF 
module, but should not be reported as a SAE during the study 
• Where death is not clearly due to disease progression of the disease under study, the AE causing the death should be reported as an SAE within 24 hours. The report should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of disease, if 
appropriate, and should assign a single primary cause of death together with a ny 
contributory causes  
Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE but every effort should be made to establish a cause of death.  An autopsy  may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of 
death, and if performed a copy of the autopsy results should be reported in an expedited fashion 
to the Sponsor. 
10.3. Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs (serious and non-serious) will be documented in the patient’s source documents and recorded in the eCRF .  
The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. Also when 
possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as 1 
comprehensive event . For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset, 
resolution, intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study . 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 96 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 10.3.1. Time Period for Collection of Adverse E vents  
AEs will be collected from the time of signature [CONTACT_812185] -screening  (if applicable) or screening 
ICFs throughout the treatment period and including the safety follow-up period. The safety 
follow-up period is defined as 28±[ADDRESS_1124629] dose of study drug. For each AE, the 
Investigator will evaluate and report the onset, resolution, intensity, causality, action taken, 
serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study . 
The change in CTCAE  v4.03 grade for each event will be recorded in the eCRF.  
10.3.2. Follow- Up of Unresolved Adverse Events  
Any AEs that are unres olved at the patient’s follow -up visit are to be followed up by [CONTACT_149798] . Additional information for any patient with an 
ongoing AE at the end of the follow-up period may be requested by [CONTACT_1034] , as needed . 
If an Investigator learns of any SAEs, including death, at any time after a patient has completed the study and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is related to PEN -
221, the Investigator should follow the reporting process for SAEs as outlined in Section  10.3.4. 
10.3.3. Variables  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
• Adverse event term  
• Date when the AE started  
• Date when the AE stopped 
• CTCAE  v4.03 grade and changes in grade during the course of the AE  
• Whether the AE is serious or not 
• Causality  assessment in relation to PEN -221 (yes or no) 
• Action taken with regard to PEN-221 
• Outcome 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs, if they pertain: 
• Date AE met criteria for serio us AE  
• Date Investigator became aware of serious AE  
• Reason AE is ser ious 
• Date of hospit alization  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Autopsy performed 
• Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s) 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 98 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria f or immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., 
spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should report it as such. All neonatal de aths that occur within [ADDRESS_1124630] to 
causality, as SAEs . Any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the 
in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported. 
10.5. Overdose  
Signs an d symptoms of an overdose should be reported as AEs. Overdoses will not be considered 
SAEs unless the outcome of the overdose meets seriousness criteria (see Section  10.1.3).  
However, any overdose must be reported to the Medical Monitor or designee immediately. 
The M edical Monitor, in conjunction with the Investigator, will decide whether the patient 
should continue to participate in the study. All pr otocol deviations and reasons for such 
deviations must be documented in the patient’s source records.  
Any patient receiving a higher dose than intended should be monitored carefully and managed 
with appropriate supportive care measures.  
10.6. Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations, including protocol waivers (i.e., prospective deviations), are not acceptable. Any protocol deviations and reasons for such deviations must be documented in the patient’s 
source records.  The Sponsor will review any protocol deviations and  provide additional training 
to ensure that deviations are not repeated , and, if required, amend the protocol. The Sponsor will 
notify regulatory authorities of any non-compliance considered a serious breach of GCP or the protocol.

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 11. DATA REV IEW AND MANAGEMENT 
11.1. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_16059], in 
order to comply with good clinical practices ( GCP ) guidelines. 
Before a study center can enter a patient into the study, a representative o f the Sponsor or 
designee will visit the study center to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities . 
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives . 
This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. 
During the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or designee will have regular contacts with the  
study center , for the following: 
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s). 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable . 
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately recorded in the source documents and eCRFs, and that investigational product accountability checks are being performed . 
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records relevant to the study. This will require  direct access to all original records for each 
patient (e.g. , clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor or designee. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented in the eCRFs and confirm any SAEs ha ve been forwarded to the Sponsor or designee, and those SAEs that met 
criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or EC . 
The monitor will be available between visits if the I nvestigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
11.2. Case Report F orm Completion  
The Sponsor or designee will provide the study centers with eCRFs. 
eCRFs will be completed for each study patient. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure 
the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the patie nt’s eCRF. Source 
documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the patient’s participation in the study 
and should document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, and patient status. 
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a patient is seen for an 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1124631] electronically sign and date the Investigator’s Statement at the end of the eCRF to endorse the recorded data.  
11.3. Computerized Systems / Medical Records as Source Data  
All stu dy data recorded on source documents are to be transcribed into the eCRFs. Any 
electronic study data are to be entered into a secure, validated data processing system and a backup maintained. Any changes to electronic study data will be documented.

ratio of actual dose received and actual duration) and the relative dose intensity (computed as the ratio of dose intensity and planned dose received/planned duration) will be listed and summ arized by [CONTACT_812161] . 
Concomitant medications and significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812102], and summarized by [CONTACT_812162]. 
The ITT population will be used. 
12.6. Primary O bjective 
The primary objective of Phase 1  is to determine the MTD of PEN -221 when administered IV on 
a 3 week schedule. The corresponding primary analysis is based  on an adaptive BLRM  in 
conjunction with EWOC, as desc ribed in detail in Section  12.6.1. 
The DD population will be used. At the conclusion of Phase 1, the final recommended dose for future development will be based 
on considerations of the MTD estimated by [CONTACT_111831], and on an overall clinical assessment of all available safety, tolerability, PK and PD c data from all cycles at all different dose levels 
tested, in both phases of the study. This dose, which may be lower than the MTD estimated from the BLRM, will be referred to as th e recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). 
The primary objective of Phase 2a is to assess the efficacy of PEN -[ADDRESS_1124637], version 1.1,  along with  duration of 
response.  
The EA population will be used.

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 12.6.1. Phase 1  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of MTD and the P rimary Variable 
The MTD is defined as the highest dose for a given schedule that is not expected by [CONTACT_812163] 33% of patients. Estimation of the MTD during the dose escalation 
phase of the study will be based upon the posterior distribution of the incidence of DLT in C1 in patients in the dose- determining set.  
The primary variable is the fr equency of DLTs associated with continuous daily administration 
of PEN -[ADDRESS_1124638] cycle of treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical H ypothesis, Model, and Method of Analysis 
An adaptive BLRM with 2 parameters, guided by [CONTACT_812164]  (Babb 1998; Neuenschwander 2008) , 
will be used to make dose recommendations and estimate the MTD during the dose- escal ation  
phase of the study. 
The dose- toxicity relationship is modeled by [CONTACT_111831] : 
logit�𝜋𝜋
(𝑑𝑑)�=log(𝛼𝛼)+𝛽𝛽log(𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑∗⁄),𝛼𝛼> 0,𝛽𝛽> 0 
where logit�𝜋𝜋(𝑑𝑑)�=log (𝜋𝜋(𝑑𝑑)(1−𝜋𝜋 (𝑑𝑑)) ⁄ ). Doses are rescaled as d/d* with reference dose 
d*=20.[ADDRESS_1124639] the following interpretation:  
• 𝛼𝛼 equal s the odds of toxicity at the reference dose d*.  
• Doubling the dose results in an increase in odds of toxicity by a factor of 2𝛽𝛽. 
For a dose equal to zero, the probability of toxicity is zero. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prior S pecification  
The model parameters (log(𝛼𝛼),log(𝛽𝛽)) are given a weakly informative bivariate normal prior 
distribution that is guided by [CONTACT_812165], and allows efficient escalation toward the MTD. To tune the prior distribution for the model, a priori  it is assumed that doses higher than 13.3 mg exceed 
the EWOC threshold (i.e., greater than 25% probability of excessive toxicity), while doses at or below [ADDRESS_1124640] the 6.7 – 13.3 mg range, which includes the predicted MTD of 
9 mg based on allometric scaling.  Prior parameter values for the bivariate normal distribution of 
the model parameters are presented in  Table 13, and the resulting prior distribution of DLT rates 
is illustrated  in Figure  2. Prior probabilities of excessive toxicity at each dose are shown in  
Table 14.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose R ecommendation  
After each cohort of patients, the posterior distribution for the probabilities of DLT rates at 
different dose levels are obtained. The results of this analysis are summarized in terms of the estimated probabilities that the true rate of DLT at each dose level will have of lying in eac h of 
the following intervals: 
• [0, 0.16) under-dosing 
• [0.16, 0.33) targeted toxicity 
• [0.33, 1] excessive toxicity 
The escalation with overdose control (EWOC) criteria is used to guide dose recommendations for each cohort. A dose is not considered admissible for the next cohort unless, given the current 

Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 105 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 data, there is a small chance (posterior probability < 25%) that this dose is excessively toxic 
(DLT rate > 33%).  
Within the constraints of the EWOC criteria, dose recommendations are based on maximizing the p osterior probability that the DLT rate is in the targeted toxicity interval.  
The dose recommended for the next cohort is the 1 which has maximum probability of being in the targeted toxicity region  (16% – 33% DLT rate), provided it satisfies the EWOC  crite ria and 
does not represent more than a doubling ( ≤ 100% increase) of the current dose. 
If the recommended dose satisfying the EWOC  criteria is > 100% increase in dose, then 
escalation will proceed  to the highest dose level which is ≤  100% increase from current dose. 
The dose recommended by [CONTACT_812166] a clinical assessment of the toxicity profiles observed at the time of analysis in 
determining the next dose level to be investigated. 
Details of the criteria for dose escalation and determination of the M TD are provided in 
Section  12.6.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_812103]-escalation phase may be stopped in 1 of the following circumstances:  
• Stop to declare MTD : The study stops with a determination of MTD at dose 𝑑𝑑 ̃ if the 
model’s recommended dose for the next cohort is 𝑑𝑑 ̃ and the following conditions are 
met: 
1. At lea st [ADDRESS_1124641] already been evaluated at dose 𝑑𝑑 ̃. 
2. One of the following conditions is satisfied:  
a. The probability of 𝑑𝑑̃ being in the targeted toxicity region is at least 0. 6. 
b. At least [ADDRESS_1124642] been evaluated in the study . 
• Stop for over-dosing: Th e study stops with a declaration that the MTD is below the 
lowest dose if there are no doses available that satisfy the EWOC criteria.  
12.6.2. Phase 2a 
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Benefit Rate for gastrointestinal mid -gut NET and pancreatic NET  
Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall CR, PR, or 
SD as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. 
For each NET cohort, CBR will be estimated and presented with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs)based on the exact binomial distribution.  
In addition, a Bayesian approach will be used to estimate the CBR and its 95% credible interval 
based on the posterior distribution. A vague beta prior distribution with parameters a=1 and b=1 
will be used. This translates to a prior mean of 50% with wide uncertainty. 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 106 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 At completion of the study, the prior distribution will be updated with all data available from the 
evaluable patients at the MTD/RP2D to obtain the posterior distribution of the true CBR. For 
each NET cohort, the posterior probability that the true CBR is greater t han 75% will be 
reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Objective R esponse Rate for SCLC  
Objective response rate ( ORR ) is defined as the proportion of patients with a  best overall CR or 
PR as defined  by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 . 
ORR will be estimated and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the exact 
binomial distribution.  
In addition, a Bayesian approach will be used to estimate the ORR and its 95% credible interval 
based on the posterior distribution. A vague beta prior distribution with parameters a=1 and b=1 will be used. This translates to a prior mean of 50% with wide uncertainty. 
At completion of the study, the prior distribution will be updated with all data available from the 
evaluable patients at the MTD/RP2D to obtain the posterior distribution of the true ORR. For the SCLC, the posterior probability that the true ORR is greater than 30% will be reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Duration of Response for SCLC  
Duration of response ( DOR ) is defined as the time from first documented response (CR or PR) to 
the date of first documented disease progressi on or death due to underlying cancer. If a patient 
has not progressed or died before the analysis cutoff date, DOR will be censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.  
DOR will be analyzed and presented using the Kaplan -Meier method, along with the estimated 
median (in months) with 95% CIs, 25
th and 75th percentiles.  
12.7. Secondary O bjectives  
12.7.1. Safety Analysis 
An objective of all phases of the study is to further characterize the safety and tolerability of PEN -221, including acute and chronic toxicities. This will be based on a comprehensive review 
of all safety data, including all observed AEs  . Data from patients of all study phases will be 
pooled for analysis according to dose received. All patients who receive any amount of PEN-221 will be included i n the final summaries and listings of safety data.  
For all safety analyses, the SA population will be used. All listings and tables will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] (dose level) and tumor-specific cohort group. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
Summary tables will present the number of patients observed with treatment- emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) and corresponding percentages, where treatment -emergent is defined as any AE 
that occurs after administration of the first d ose of study drug and through [ADDRESS_1124643] 
dose of study drug, any event that is considered study drug- related regardless of the start date of 
the event, or any event that is present at baseline but worsens in intensity or is subsequently 
considered study drug- related by  [CONTACT_737].  
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 107 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 The denominator used to calculate incidence percentages consists of patients receiving any 
amount of PEN-221. Within each summary table, the AEs will be categorized according to the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA) s ystem organ class and preferred term . 
Additional subcategories will be based on event intensity (severity graded according to CTCAE, version 4.03) and relation ship to study drug. 
Deaths , SAEs, and TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation will be tabulated on a per-
patient basis , as warranted by [CONTACT_26739]. 
For Phase 1 , the DLTs, MTD, and RP2D will be identified. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Anomalies 
Change from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters will be summarized across time on study. 
Furthermore, the frequency of laboratory abnormalities by [CONTACT_2077]- baseline CTCAE 
grade will be tabulated by [CONTACT_812167], white blood cell count, ANC, lymphocytes, platelet count, AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin, creatinine, ALP , and electrolytes. Shift tables also may be produced for these 
parameters based on the baseline CTCAE grade and the maximum CTCAE grade by [CONTACT_89835].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs, ECG, and Other Safety Data 
Changes in vital sign parameters (including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate) and body weight will be summarized over time, and any abnormal values will be tabulated.  
The proportions of patients with treatment- emergent clinically significant ECG abnormalities 
will be tabulated, and changes in ECG findings will be presented in data listing format. 
ECOG performance status will be summarized by [CONTACT_812168]; ECOG 
performance status will be presented in data listing format.  
Additional safety analyses may b e determined at any time without prejudice, in order to most 
clearly enumerate rates of toxicities and to define further  the safety profile of PEN -221. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tolerability  
Tolerability will be comprehensively examined based on safety data.  
12.7.2. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
All patients who have at least [ADDRESS_1124644] non- compartmental methods.  For Phase 2 a, additional PK timepoints will be collected 
on C1D2 and C1D8 to better characterize PEN -221, DM1  and peptide from PEN-221. PK 
samples on C3D1 are not  required  for Phase 2a.  
The following PK parameters will be calculated: the maximum plasma concentration (C
max), time 
to C max (tmax), area under the plasma concentration time curve from zero to the time of the last 
measurable concentration (AUC (0-t)) and from zero to infinity (AUC ∞), CL, and the apparent

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 volume of distribution (V ss; Vz), terminal rate constant (λ z), and t ½. The dependency of the 
pharmacokinetics on multiple dosing will be assessed by [CONTACT_812169] (0-t) 
C3D1  and C1D1. 
This protocol uses fixed doses. The relationship between CL of PEN-221 and body size, as 
measured by [CONTACT_812170] ( BMI ), will be examined as data accrues.  If the 
analysis indicates that CL is dependent on body size, then dosing will be modified to a body- size 
basis by [CONTACT_812171] . 
The PK may  also be characterized by [CONTACT_812172]-PDc response relationships and population covariates. The model to 
be used will be determined from the data and will be parameterized in terms of CL and V ss. 
12.7.3. Efficacy Analysis 
Evidence of preliminary anti -tumor activity will be  assessed by [CONTACT_812173] , as 
defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. This will be used to summarize the objective response rate (CR+PR), as 
well as the rates for the individual categories of response, (i.e., CR, PR, SD, and PD). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Progression -free Survival 
Progres sion- free survival ( PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose of PEN -[ADDRESS_1124645] adequate tumor assessment.  
PFS will be analyzed and presented using the Kaplan -Meier method, along with the estimated 
median (in months) with 95% CIs, 25th and 75th percentiles.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall Survival 
Overall survival ( OS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose of PEN -[ADDRESS_1124646].  
OS will be analyzed and presented using the K aplan -Meier method, along with the estimated 
median (in months) with 95% CIs, 25
th and 75th percentiles.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Objective R esponse Rate for gastrointestinal mid- gut NET and pancreatic NET  
For gastrointestinal mid -gut-NET and pancreatic NET, objective response rate (ORR) is defined 
as the proportion of patients with a best overall CR or PR as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. 
ORR will be estimated and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the exact 
binomial distribution.  
In addition, a Bayesian approach will be used to estimate the ORR and its 95% credible interval based on the posterior distribution. A vague beta prior distribution with parameters a=1 and b=1 will be used. This translates to a prior mean of 50% with wide uncertainty. 
At completio n of the study, the prior distribution will be updated with all data available from the 
evaluable patients at the MTD/RP2D to obtain the posterior distribution of the true ORR. The 
posterior probability that the true ORR is greater than 20% will be reporte d.

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 [IP_ADDRESS]. Duration of Response for gastrointestinal mid- gut NET and pancreatic NET  
For gastrointestional mid -gut NET and pancreatic NET, duration of response (DOR) is defined 
as the time from first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented di sease 
progression or death due to underlying cancer. If a patient has not progressed or died before the 
analysis cutoff date, DOR will be censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.  
DOR will be analyzed and presented using the Kaplan -Meier meth od, along with the estimated 
median (in months) with 95% CIs, 25th and 75th percentiles.  
12.8. Interim Analyses  
No formal interim analyses are planned  in Phase [ADDRESS_1124647] 10 patients per cohort before deciding whether to pro ceed to the second stage of each cohort.  
12.9. Sample S ize Calculation  
No formal statistical power calculations to determined sample size were performed for this study. However, based on the performance characteristics computed and described hereafter, the sample sizes in each phase are adequate to address the study’s objectives. 
12.9.1. Phase [ADDRESS_1124648] 6 patients treated at the MTD 
level. The actual number of patients will depend on the number of dose levels/cohorts that are 
tested. Based on the simulation study undertaken with the East 6.4 software to evaluate operating characteristics of the BLRM (see Section  15.2) at least [ADDRESS_1124649] reasonable operating characteristics relating to 
its MTD recommendation . 
12.9.2. Phase 2a 
No formal sample size calculation s were performed  for Phase 2a. A total of approximately 75 
patients will be enrolled in Phase 2a. This includes the following Phase 2a cohorts : GI mid -gut 
NETs  (n=35) , pancreatic NETs  (n=20), and
 advanced or metastatic SCLC  (n=20).  
For patients with advanced pancreatic NET, approved drugs (beyond somatostatin analogs) 
include sunitinib and everolimus, both of which improved PFS but are associated with clinical 
benefit  rates of approximately 72 % for sunitinib and 78% for everolimus  (Raymond 2011; Yao 
2011) . In the pancreatic NET group, an observed clinical benefit  rate of 75 % or greater would 
be considered promising. Given a sample size of 20 patients, if clinical benefit is observed in 15 patients (observed rate of 75%), the posterior probability of the true rate being <65% is 0.20, with the 95% credible interval around the true rate being (52.8%, 88.7%). If only 14 responses 
are seen (observed clinical benefit rate of 70%), the probability of the true clinical benefit rate 
being at least 75% is 0.26, while seeing only 13 responses (observed clinical benefit rate of 65%) 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 110 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 would result in that probability being only 0.13. If the true underlying clinical benefit rate is 
75%, there is 0.38 probability to observe fewer than 15 patients achieve clinical benefit. This 
probability drops to 0.20 if the true underlying rate is 80%. 
For patients with advanced gastrointestinal NETs , approved drugs (beyond somatostatin analogs) 
include everolimus, which has been shown to improve PFS but is associated with a clinical 
benefit  rate of 83% (Yao 2016) . In a randomized Phase 3 study,177Lu-DOTATATE plus 
Octreotide LAR  in patients with advanced GI mid -gut NETs was shown to improve PFS and is 
associated with a clinical benefit rate of 82%  (Strosberg 2017; Strosberg 2016 [4th Theranostics 
World Congress 2016])) . In the gastrointestinal mid -gut NET  group, an observed clinical benefit 
rate of approximately 75 % or greater would be considered promising. In a sample 35 patients, if 
clinical benefit is observed in 26 patients (observed rate of 7 4%), the posterior probability of the 
true rate being <65% is 0. 14, with the 95% credible interval around the true rate being (57.8 %, 
85.8%). If only 25 responses are seen (observed clinical benefit rate of 71 %), the pro bability of 
the true clinical benefit rate being at least 75% is 0.27, while seeing only 24  responses (observed 
clinical benefit rate of 69%) would result in that probability being only 0.17. If the true underlying clinical benefit rate is 75%, there is 0.37  probability to observe fewer than 26 patients 
achieve clinical benefit. This probability drops to 0.15 if the true underlying rate is 80%. Approximately 25 of the 35 patients in the gastrointestinal mid -gut NET  group are expected to 
be treated at the current RP2D (15mg), and among these patients, approximately [ADDRESS_1124650] not received prior PRRT. These two subgroups will be summarized separately. For the 
subgroup of approximately 20 patients without prior PRRT and who are treated at the current RP2D , the performance characteristics based on a target CBR of 75% (15 patients with clinical 
benefit out of 20) are the same as those presented in the previous paragraph for the pancreatic 
NET  cohort.  
For patients with advanced SCLC,  approved drugs in the second-line include topotecan, whi ch 
has been shown in a randomized Phase 3 study  (von Pawel 1999) compared to 
cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin- vincristine (CAV) to achieve similar time to progression, 
survival, and response rates (topotecan 24% vs. CAV 18%) in patients who relapsed >[ADDRESS_1124651]-line chemotherapy (topotecan 13.6% vs. CAV 4.8% ). In the 
platinum- sensitive SCLC  group, a tumor response rate of 30% or greater would be considered 
very promising. Given a sample size of 20 patients, if 6 responses are seen (observed ORR of 
30%), the posterior probability of the true ORR being < 10% is 0.5% and being ≥ 30% is  55%, 
with the 95% credible interval about the true ORR being (14.6%, 52.2%). For a cohort of 20 
patients , if the observed proportion is 0.3, there is 100% probability that the true underlying 
proportion exceeds 0.05, and 55.0% probability that the true underlying proportion exceeds 0.3. 
If the true underlying proportion is 0.3, there i s 0.1% probability to observe 0 responses. If only 
4 responses are seen (observed ORR of 20%) the probability of the true ORR being ≥ 30% drops 
to 19.8%, while seeing only 2 responses (observed ORR of 10%) would result in that probability 
being only 2.7%. If the true underlying proportion is 0.3, there is 0.1% probability to observe [ADDRESS_1124652] 21 weeks (7 
cycles) prior to the analysis cutoff date.  
12.10.  Replacement of Patients  
Patients may only be replaced in 2 instances:  
•Patients who are discontinued from the study prior to receiving study drug PEN-221 may
be replaced  (i.e. lost to follow -up, withdraw consent).
•Patients in the dose-escalation phase who withdraw before completing C1 assessments
for reasons other than experi encing a DLT may be replaced .

15.1. Introduction  
This appendix evaluates the performance of the proposed adaptive BLRM  with EWOC  via 
computer simulations. The detailed dose escalation procedure is described in Section  8.6.1 of the 
study protocol. In brief, the EWOC criteria is used to guide dose recommendations for each 
cohort. A dose is not considered admissible for the next cohort unless, given the current data, 
there is a small chance (posterior probability < 25%) that this dose is excessively toxic (DLT rate > 33%). Within the constraints of the EWOC criteria, dose recommendations are based on 
maximizing the posterior probability that the DLT rate is in the targeted toxicity interval of 16% 
– 33%.
15.2. Operating Characteristics for Simulation  
15.2.1. Dose L evels  
The dose levels for simulation are given as 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6.7, 10, 13.3, 16.6, and 20.8 mg. The 
starting dose for simulations is 1.0 mg, but a lower dose of 0.5 mg is provided in case a dose 
reduction from the starting dose is necessary. 
15.2.2. Statistical Model  
For a dose 𝑑𝑑, let 𝜋𝜋 (𝑑𝑑) denote the probability of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at dose 𝑑𝑑 . For a 
cohort of size 𝑛𝑛  evaluated at dose 𝑑𝑑 , the number of patients, 𝑦𝑦 , with a DLT is assumed to follow 
a binomial distribution:  
𝑦𝑦 | 𝜋𝜋 (𝑑𝑑) ~ Binomial (𝑛𝑛,𝜋𝜋(𝑑𝑑)) 
The relationship between doses and DLT rates is modeled by [CONTACT_812180]�𝜋𝜋(𝑑𝑑)�=log(𝛼𝛼)+𝛽𝛽log(𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑∗⁄),𝛼𝛼> 0,𝛽𝛽> 0 
where logit�𝜋𝜋(𝑑𝑑)�=log (𝜋𝜋(𝑑𝑑)(1−𝜋𝜋 (𝑑𝑑)) ⁄ ). Doses are rescaled as d/d* with reference dose 
d*=20.[ADDRESS_1124657] the following interpretation:  
•𝛼𝛼 equals the odds of toxicity at the reference dose d*.
•Doubling the dose results in an increase in odds of toxicity by a factor of 2𝛽𝛽.
For a dose equal to zero, the probability of toxicity is zero. 15.2.3. Prior Specification  
The model parameters (log(𝛼𝛼),log(𝛽𝛽)) are given a weakly informative bivariate normal prior 
distribution that is guided by [CONTACT_812165], and allows efficient escalatio n towards the MTD. To 
tune the prior distribution for the model, a priori  it is assumed that doses higher than 13.3 mg 
exceed the EWOC threshold (i.e., greater than 25% probability of excessive toxicity), while

predicted MTD of 9 mg based on allometric scaling. The prior parameter values to be used in 
this study are given in  Table 17, and the resulting prior distribution of DLT rates is illustrated 
inFigure  3.Prior probabilities of excessive toxicity at each dose are shown in Table 18.

A consider
ation in tuning the prior parameter values is to produce a model that adapts well to 
emerging data. To illustrate the proposed model’s response to DLTs in early cohorts, Figure  4 
shows the prior probabilities of excessive toxicity for each dose along with the posterior probabilities of excessive toxicity after observing a single DLT in cohort 1, 2 or 3. Prior to

Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 15.2.4. Dose E scalation R ules for S imulation  
The principle of escalation with overdose control (EWOC) prohibits recommending a particular 
dose for the next cohort unless, given the current data, there is a small chance (posterior 
probability < 25%) that this dose is excessively toxic (DLT rate > 33%). 
Within the constraints of the EWOC criteria, dose recommendations are based on maximizing 
the posterior probability that the DLT rate is in the targeted toxicity interval. For simulations, 
dose escalation proceeds according to the following rules: 
• Each cohort has 3 patients. 
• The dose recommended for the next cohort is the 1 that  has maximum probability of 
being in the targeted toxicity region (16% – 33% DLT rate), provided it satisfies the EWOC criteria and is does not skip an untried dose. 
• If the recomme nded dose satisfying the EWOC criteria is higher than the next higher 
dose, then escalate only to the next higher dose. 
• Stop to declare MTD:  The study stops with a determination of MTD at dose 𝑑𝑑 ̃ if the 
model’s recommended dose for the next cohort is 𝑑𝑑 ̃ and the following conditions are 
met: 
1. At least [ADDRESS_1124659] already been evaluated at dose 𝑑𝑑 ̃. 
2. One of the following conditions is satisfied:  
a. The probability of 𝑑𝑑̃ being in the targeted toxicity region is at least 0.[ADDRESS_1124660] been evaluated in the study . 
• Stop for over-dosing:  The study stops with a declaration that the MTD is below the 
lowest dose if there are no doses available that satisfy the EWOC criteria.  
15.2.5. Hypothetical Dose-Toxicity Relationships for Simulation 
Simulations were perfor med considering 5 hypothetical dose toxicity curves ( Table 19  and 
Figure  5) which capture a range of potential true underlying dose toxicity relatio nships. 
a. Steep dose toxicity curve and MTD is in the early range of dose levels  
b. Steep dose toxicity curve and MTD is in the middle range of dose levels  
c. Steep dose toxicity curve and MTD is in the upper range of dose levels 
d. Flat dose toxicity curve and MTD is in the middle range of dose levels 
e. Flat dose toxicity curve and MTD is in the late range of dose levels  
f. Steep dose toxicity curve and all doses are excessively toxic 
g. Flat dose toxicity curve and all doses are excessively toxic

In scenarios a – e, there is a high chance (62% – 80% probability) that the BLRM method 
recommends a dose with DLT rate in the target range of 0.16 – 0.33. Across all  of these 
scenarios, there is a low chance of recommending an excessively toxic dose (<11%  probability), 
of assigning a patient to an excessively toxic dose (<13% probability), and of a patient in the study experiencing a DLT (<24% probability). In scenario f, which assumes all doses are highly 
toxic with DLT rates of at least 50%, it is very u nlikely (7% probability) that any dose is 
recommended. Instead , the MTD would be declared to be below the lowest dose (93% 
probability). Scenario g also assumes all doses are in the excessive toxicity region, but the early doses are only slightly above the cutoff for excessive toxicity.  Table 21 shows the probability of 
selecting each dose as MTD  in scenario g. When a dose is selected as MTD, there is a high 
probability (95%) that the selected dose is one of 0.5, 1, 2, or 4, all of which have DLT rates 
33% – 40%, just above the cutoff for excessive toxicity.

15.4. Dose R ecommendation  
After at least 3 patients in a cohort become evaluable, the posterior distribution for the 
probabilities of DLT rates at different dose levels will be obtained. The results of this analysis 
will be summarized in terms of the estimated probabilities that the true rate of DLT at each dose -
level has of lying in each of the following intervals: 
• [0, 0.16) under-dosing 
• [0.16, 0.33) targeted toxicity 
• [0.33, 1] excessive toxicity 
Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc Confidential  Page 125 of 132 
Protocol PEN -221-001  Version 8.0, 12 July  2019 The escalation with overdose control (EWOC) criteria will be used to guide dose 
recommendations for each cohort. A dose will not be considered admissible for the next cohort 
unless, given the current data, there is a small chance (posterior probability < 25%) that this dose is excessively toxic (DLT rate > 33%).  
Within the constraints of the EWOC criteria, dose recommendations will be based on maximizing the posterior probability that the DLT rate is in the targeted toxicity interval.  
The dose recommended for the next cohort will be the 1 that  has maximum probability of being 
in the targeted toxicity region  (16% – 33% DLT  rate), provided it satisfies the EWOC  criteria  
and does not represent more than a doubling ( ≤ 100% increase) of the current dose. 
If the recommended dose satisfying the EWOC  criteria is > 100% increase in dose, then 
escalation will proceed  to the highest dose level which is ≤  100% increase from current dose. 
The dose recommended by [CONTACT_812181] a clinical assessment of the toxicity profiles observed at the time of analysis in determining the nex t dose level to be investigated. 
Details of the criteria for dose escalation and determination of the M TD are provided in 
Section  8.6.1. 
15.5. Discussion  
The BLRM with EWOC  for the dose- escalation phase of the study enables the use of all safety 
data in the study when making dose-escalation recommendations. 
The metrics provided in this section demonstrate that the model is robust to different scenarios of 
the truth, selecting the MTD with high probability. In general, the model is conservative due to 
the overdose control criterion. In all scenarios, the probabilities of recommending a dose with excessive toxicity (probability of DLT greater than 33%) are much smaller than the probabilities 
of recommending a dose with targeted toxicity (probability of DLT between 16% and 33%) as 
the MTD. In addition, the average proportion of patients receiving a dose with excessive toxicity (probability of DLT g reater than 33%) is less than 13%.  
On-study recommendation based on the model are consistent with the clinical decision- making 
process, and should be considered in conjunction with other availa ble clinical information by [CONTACT_812182].

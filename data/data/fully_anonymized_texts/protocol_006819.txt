GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.0 , dated May 29th, 2017 5 2.  BACKGROUND 
 
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an established therapeutic option for 
patients with symptomatic, severe aortic valve stenosis, who are ineligible or at high risk for 
conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).1-4 Results from the NOTION ( Nordic Aortic 
Valve Intervention Trial) randomized clinical trial showed that TAVR may also be a viable option for 
patients with a lower risk profile.5 
Very recently, Makkar et al. (2015) reported that leaflet thickening and reduced leaflet motion is not 
uncommon after both TAVR and SAVR – with an incidence of ~ 20%. Although reduced leaflet motion 
did not result in higher transvalvular gradients, the authors emphasized that this phenomenon should 
be further investigated for its effect on clinical outcomes (e.g. stroke) and valve durability. As this valve 
leaflet thickening and reduced motion could be reversed by [CONTACT_895709] (OAC) treatment and 
was not observed in patients on chronic OAC therapy, the authors hypothesized that this phenomenon 
could be related to possible leaflet thrombosis or a “thrombotic film” on the leaflets.[ADDRESS_1255830] recent ESC guidelines, the need for a 3-month period of postoperative OAC therapy has 
been challenged in patients with aortic bioprostheses (class IIb, level of evidence C), with the use of 
low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_895703].7 Although the rates of thrombo-embolic events 
among patients given OAC after surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve implantation appear to be lower 
than the event rates among patients given aspi[INVESTIGATOR_264086], OAC treatment is associated with more 
bleeding.8 With the limited evidence to date based primarily on observational studies, the trade-off 
between reduced thromboembolic events with OAC and increased bleeding remains uncertain. 
Currently, treatment of TAVR patients with dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT; aspi[INVESTIGATOR_8258]) 
for 3-6 months is widely accepted and recommended9 – however, this recommendation is not based 
on hard evidence and the usefulness of DAPT is questioned. Two small studies revealed that the risk 
for cardiovascular events was not reduced, while the risk for bleeding increased in the DAPT group 
compared to single antiplatelet therapy.10,[ADDRESS_1255831] medical treatment in patients undergoing TAVR. As novel oral anti-
coagulants (NOACs) such as rivaroxaban may reduce the risk for TAVR-related thrombotic events, 
without increasing the bleeding risk, this study aims to evaluate whether a rivaroxaban -based strategy, 
following successful TAVR, compared to an antiplatelet -based strategy, is superior in reducing 
subclinical valve leaflet thickening and motion abnormalit ies – as detected by [CONTACT_66997] -dimensional, 
volume- rendered computed tomography (4DCT) . 
 
3. PURPOSE 
 
The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether a rivaroxaban-based strategy, following successful 
TAVR, compared to an antiplatelet-based strategy, is superior in reducing subclinical valve leaflet 
thickening and motion abnormalities – as evaluated by 4DCT imaging at three months following TAVR .  
 
 
 
GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.0 , dated May 29th, 2017 6 4. STUDY DESIGN 
 
The GALILEO- 4D trial will be conducted as a substudy of the multicenter, open-label, randomized, 
event-driven, active-controlled GALILEO trial. Patients will be 1:1 randomiz ed to an antiplatelet-based 
strategy vs. rivaroxaban-based strategy – the randomization will adopt the same 1:[ADDRESS_1255832]-scan should be performed 90days ± [ADDRESS_1255833]-scan should 
preferentially be performed at the same day of Visit #3 or some days before Visit#3, but should – if 
possible – NOT be performed after Visit #3. 
 
            Study design of the GALILEO trial:  
 
Successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as defined in the main GALILEO study protocol. 
R, randomization; ASA, acetylsalicylic acid; OD, once-daily. 
 
 

GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.0 , dated May 29th, 2017 7 5.   STUDY POPULATION 
 
5.1. Inclusion & exclusion criteria 
 
 Inclusion criteria 
1. Patient included in the randomized GALILEO trial 
2. Written informed consent 
 
 Exclusion criteria 
 
1. Severe renal insufficiency (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) or on dialysis, or post-TAVR 
unresolved acute kidney injury with renal dysfunction ≥ stage [ADDRESS_1255834] imaging (i.e. 
multiple myeloma, etc.) 
 
6.   STUDY PROCEDURES 
 
6.1. Patient information 
The patient is informed orally and in writing by [CONTACT_895710]-4D 
substudy and written informed consent is obtained before study inclusion. Patients will have to 
give written informed consent for the GALILEO and GALILEO-4D substudy before study entry, 
preferably in parallel. The patient will also receive a copy of the patient information and, if 
requested, of the informed consent. 
 
6.2. Randomization 
All criteria of the GALILEO- 4D trial have to be fulfilled in order to make a patient suitable for 
randomization in the GALILEO-4D trial . In order to obtain 1:1 randomization in the GALILEO 
and GALILEO-4D trial, a stratified randomization will be foreseen for those patients included in 
both s tudies .  
 
  6 .3. Antithrombotic/anticoagulant treatment 
 
 
 
 
 

GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.0 , dated May 29th, 2017 8  
 
 
Additional information 
 The route of administration of all medication is oral. 
 Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] [ADDRESS_1255835] 300 mg 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_895704].  
 The first dose of rivaroxaban (10mg once-daily) is given either immediately after 
randomization or within 1-[ADDRESS_1255836] intake of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. Rivaroxaban 10 mg 
once-daily can be taken with or without food; rivaroxaban 20 mg once-daily should always 
be taken with food. Rivaroxaban is continued until the end- of-treatment period visit of the 
main GALILEO trial. 
 
 IN THE EVENT OF NEW-ONSET ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (NOAF): 
 
 
 
 

GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.0 , dated May 29th, 2017 9 Additional information 
 
 In the event of NOAF, the antiplatelet-based strategy will be stopped and a vitamin K 
antagonist (VKA) with a target INR 2-3 started. ASA 75-100 mg once-daily is to be 
continued in combination with VKA until 90 days after randomization. 
 In the event of NOAF, the dose of rivaroxaban is switched from 10 mg once-daily to 20 or 
15 mg once-daily – depending on renal function – for those patients in the rivaroxaban 
group. Rivaroxaban 20 and 15 mg once-daily should be taken with food. ASA 75-100 mg 
once-daily is to be continued until 90 days after randomization. 
 
In order to preserve the 1:1 randomization in the main GALILEO trial and avoid excessive and 
unfounded ’cross-over’ from the antiplatelet group to the rivaroxaban group, results of the 
4DCT-scan will be kept blinded for t he treating physician and patient until the end oft he main 
GALILEO study. 
 
Only in case of a clinical overt ischemic stroke or non-CNS systemic emboli sm within three 
months after randomization , an additional cardiac 4DCT-scan within [ADDRESS_1255837]-scan could be 
made available to the treating physician. 
 
 
6.4. Adverse event reporting 
Adverse Event (AE) reporting will be done via the main GALILEO trial as described in the main 
GALILEO protocol. As the GALILEO-4D study will be a diagnostic sub-study (involving only a 
single 4DCT-scan and transthoracic echocardiography), no treatment related Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)-reporting should be anticipated.  
 
 
7. STUDY ENDPOINTS 
 
All endpoints will be assessed at three months after TAVR. 
 
7.1. Primary endpoint 
 
o The rate of patients with at least one prosthetic leaflet with > 50% motion reduction as 
assessed by [CONTACT_80622] 4DCT-scan (total N = 300).  
 
7.2. Secondary endpoints  
 
o The rate of prosthetic leaflets with > 50% motion reduction as assessed by [CONTACT_80622] 
4DCT-scan (total N = 900). 
o The rate of patients with at least one prosthetic leaflet with thickening as assessed by 
[CONTACT_80622] 4DCT-scan (total N = 300). 
GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.[ADDRESS_1255838]-scan 
(total N = 900). 
o Aortic transvalvular mean pressure gradient and effective orifice area (cm2) as 
determined by [CONTACT_294240]. 
o Functional NYHA class. 
o Death, first thromboembolic event (DTE), and safety endpoints (see GALILEO trial) 
will be assessed in the main GALILEO study and analyzed in the GALILEO-4D 
substudy with regards to occurence of the leaflet abnormalities – as exploratory 
analysis. 
 
Definitions:  
 Leaflet thickening: Hypoattentuating leaflet thickening or focal hypoattenuating 
abnormality attached to the prosthetic leaflet or diffuse thickening of the prosthetic 
valve leaflet identifiable on at least two reconstructed planes (typi[INVESTIGATOR_895705]-
oblique axial and multiplanar reformatted reconstructions). 
 Reduced motion : Reduced systolic leaflet excursion is classified as: (I) normal, (II ) 
mildly reduced (<50%), (III ) moderate to severely reduced (>50%), and (IV) 
immobile.  Reduced systolic leaflet excursion is considered significant when it is  > 
50% or immobile. Quantitative assessment of leaflet motion is performed with a 
blood pool inversion volume rendered cine reconstruction throughout the cardiac 
cycle evaluating the bioprosthetic leaflets. 
 
The 4DCT CoreLab evaluation will be performed at Rigshospi[INVESTIGATOR_370303], Copenhagen (Denmark) 
under supervision of [CONTACT_93460]. Klaus Fuglsang Kofoed and at St. Paul’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Vancouver, 
BC (Canada) under supervision of [CONTACT_895718] A. Leipsic. The readers of the 4DCT-scan will 
be blinded from the treatment arm. 
 
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
 
The primary endpoint of reduced prosthetic leaflet motion is expected to occur in 20% of patients.6 
Equal number of patients are warranted in both treatment groups. A 65% reduction of the GALILEO-
4D primary endpoint requires inclusion of 246 patients in order to demonstrate superiori ty. Taking into 
account an estimated loss at follow-up of 18% of patients, the total sample size (N) needed to 
demonstrate superiority will be [ADDRESS_1255839], as required.  
 
SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  (Power 0.8, Alpha 0.05) 
 
o Probability of event in Group A: 0.20 
o Probability of event in Group B: 0.07 
o Proportion of sample in Group A: 0.50 
o Evaluable subjects needed in Group A: 123 
o Drop-out: 0.18 
GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.0 , dated May 29th, 2017 11  
         N = 300 
 
Estimation of drop-out rate: 
o A 1 0% loss at follow-up  or death at 3 months is expected in this elderly patient population. 
o In  approx. 8% of cases, an inconclusive cardiac 4DCT can be expected.

10. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV AND DATATILSYNET 
 
The GALILEO-4D trial will be registered at ClinicalTrials.Gov and will be conducted according to 
guidelines of the Danish Datatilsyn et (Danish Data Protection Agency – The act implements the 
European Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal 
data and on the free movement of such data ). The study results will be published regardless of the 
outcomes and conclusions  that can be extracted . 
 
11. ECONOMICS 
The study is being economically supported by [CONTACT_477731] ([LOCATION_013]) to cover study costs – this 
financial support will be used primarily for research staff as well as for financial compensation of 
participating centers for additional study costs (such as 4DCT scan, echocardiography). None of the 
study investigators or members of Study Committees has a financial interest in the study. None of the 
supporters will have any conflict of interest with regard to the results of the study. Insurance and any 
legal requirements of the trial follow local legislation. 
 
 
GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.0 , dated May 29th, 2017 12 12. ETHICAL ASPECTS 
 
There are some ethical issues involved in the treatment and follow- up part of this study. Anti-
coagulation treatment in TAVR patients has proven to be safe in previous studies and in our 
experience with TAVR patients with previously known AF. There might be a slightly increased bleeding 
risk, however, this bleeding risk is kept to a minimum due to the exclusion of patients with an a priori  
increased bleeding risk ( see exclusion criteria). We can consider this risk well counterbalanced by [CONTACT_895712]. The risk 
related to the 4DCT-scan is low – patients with a renal insufficiency, iodine contrast allergy and/or 
contraindications for CT are excluded ( see exclusion criteria) Concerning the rad iation dose of the 
4DCT -scan , we can report that patien ts will receive a radiation dose of 5 -20mSievert, depending on 
weight and  heart frequency/rhythym . It can be calculated that lifetime risk to die from cancer, hereby, 
theoretically increases with maximally 0,06%. Thus, the patients’ lifetime risk to die fr om cancer 
increases from 25,0% to 25,06%. Furthermore, more than 95% of all study patients are expected to be 
more than 70 years of age. The patients are informed orally and in writing and are only included in 
case of written consent. Results of the study are expected to be of value for future patients undergoing 
TAVR.

GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.[ADDRESS_1255840]-SCAN – TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS & PROTOCOL  
 
4DCT-scan – technical requirements 
 
It is essential to have optimal CT image quality for accurate assessment of TAVR leaflet morphology 
and motion. The highest degree of image quality is needed especially during the systolic phase of the 
cardiac cycle, whereas late-diastolic images are less important. High performance in terms of temporal 
and spacial resolution of the CT technology used is mandatory. Each participating site are requested 
to forward pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]-sets to the Corelab at Rigshospi[INVESTIGATOR_895708], prior to study 
initiation.   Accordingly, a list of minimal requirements in terms of CT methodology is tabulated below. 
MDCT scanner type : High-end CT scanners with >[ADDRESS_1255841] : To achieve the highest possible temporal resolution and 
hemodynamic standardization of valve function - regardless of CT scanner used – all patients will be 
required to undergo pre-treatment with betablocker or ivabradine for heart-rate control. Target heart 
rate is less than [ADDRESS_1255842]: Contrast injection system (single vs dual-phase) and contrast type are according to 
local preference. Each site is requested to specify injection protocol and contrast type routinely used. 
MDCT-acquisition : Arterial phase (LV or descending aortic triggering), retrospective image acquisition 
with recordings of the entire R-R interval is needed. Both dose-modulation, reducing dose during 
diastole or without dose-modulation is allowed. Scan-field of view (Z-axis) should be [ADDRESS_1255843]-reconstruction : Recorded image data should be reconstructed using appropriate filtering and 
iterative reconstruction according to a vendor specific protocol provided. Data sets of lowest possible 
slice thickness (0-5-0-9 mm) at each 5% intervals of the R-R cycle (0-95%) should be reconstructed 
including the TAVR. In addition, at site where the whole heart may be included in the image, data sets 
of 2 mm slice thickness at each 5% interval of the R-R cycle should be reconstructed including the 
heart chambers. These images will be used to assess LV cardiac volumes and specifically LV stroke 
volume. 
MDCT-images : All recorded MDCT image data should be saved in DICOM format and forwarded to 
the Corelab at Righospi[INVESTIGATOR_370303]. 
 
 
 
 
 
GALILEO-4D trial, v. 3.[ADDRESS_1255844]-scan – protocol 
 
Scan protocol : Prior to imaging, patients are required to abstain from caffeine intake 16 hours before 
the scan. Baseline ECG, heart rate and blood pressure are recorded and reviewed before the scan. A 
single dosage of oral metoprolol (50 to 150 mg) is administered 1.5-[ADDRESS_1255845] scan, additional metoprolol i.v. should be given for heart rate control. In patients with metoprolol 
contraindications (allergic asthma or left ventricular ejection fraction below 30%) a single dose of oral 
ivabradin (15 mg) is given [ADDRESS_1255846] (MDCT) scanner, using a dedicated 4D 
CT volume image protocol. An image noise standard deviation level of 30 is predefined, which results 
in a variable kV and mA per patient. The kV is set to 120 by [CONTACT_15094]; if this results in a maximal mA the 
kV is raised, until a sub-maximal mA is reached. The start- and end-position of the scan is determined 
by [CONTACT_895713]. Start-position is defined as 20 mm cranial to the metal stent frame of the 
valve and end-position 16 mm (maximal Z-axis coverage) caudally by [CONTACT_230408]-spective volume imaging. 
To minimize radiation exposure, a dose-modulation approach can be used, reducing dose in the 55-
100% RR-range (diastole). The contrast images are recorded by [CONTACT_895714] a heart 
rate of less than [ADDRESS_1255847] agent (Visipaque, GE Healthcare) – 
depending on the weight of the patient – is infused at a rate of 5-6 ml/sec. The scans are initiated by 
[CONTACT_895715]. Images are reconstructed at 0.5 mm slices with 0.25 mm 
overlap with an FC03 filter and an iterative reconstruction algorithm (AIDR) for valve evaluation at 5% 
intervals within the 0-95% RR range. 
CT Image reading : The valve leaflets will be assessed systematically using 2D and 3D-VR (volume 
rendered) imaging. The 3D-VR images are generated throughout the cardiac cycle and provide an 
animated movie of the valve (4D VR-CT), with an emphasis on assessment of systolic leaflet opening. 
Leaflet motion is defined as normal, mildly reduced (<50% reduction), moderately reduced (50 to 70% 
reduction), severely reduced (>70% reduction), or immobile (lack of motion in at least one valve 
leaflet). Hypo-attenuating leaflet lesions are also studied on maximal intensity projection (MIP) 2D CT 
and correlated to reduced leaflet motion .  
Inter-observer variability : 4DCT-scans performed in the SAVORY trial were analyzed by a local site 
reader (K.K.) and the CT Core Lab (H.J.). There was concordance between both readers in [ADDRESS_1255848] software (3mensio and Vitrea) by [CONTACT_895716] (H.J. and J.F./D.B.) – in 20 consecutive patients, there was a 100% 
concordance for assessment of leaflet motion (Makkar et al., NEJM 2015).

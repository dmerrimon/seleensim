Adalimumab, an anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) monoclonal antibody, is an effective treatment for refractory, JIA-associated uveitis and CAU.  However, there are concerns regarding long-term adverse events associated with adalimumab treatment. In addition to possible detrimental effects of long-term treatment, the financial burden associated with adalimumab is a motivating factor for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]. There are no prospective studies examining uveitis recurrence rates after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_342936]-associated uveitis or CAU who have achieved control of inflammation. Identifying potential predictors of recurrence of ocular inflammation could inform treatment decisions for personalized care. The potential for drug resistance further warrants the development of treatment guidelines. The results of this proposed study will provide evidence for the safety and utility of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_342936]-associated uveitis or CAU.   2.2 BACKGROUND  Chronic, asymptomatic, anterior uveitis occurs in 12-38% of all patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) within 7 years of the onset of arthritis. 20-25% of all pediatric uveitis is associated with JIA.1–[ADDRESS_424709] of all patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_342937] 10-15% becoming legally blind.4–6  It is well-recognized that there is a chronic anterior uveitis phenotype in children that looks identical to chronic JIA-associated uveitis, but without the history of arthritis.7 Chronic anterior uveitis (CAU) does not have systemic manifestations of disease but presents similarly in the eye and can result in identical visual complications as JIA-associated uveitis.  A large, population-based analysis using data from the National Paediatric Rheumatological Database in [LOCATION_013] showed that chronic anterior uveitis in children without arthritis appears to take a course similar to that of uveitis in patients with JIA and thus should be managed similarly.[ADDRESS_424710] been clinically detected since it is often mild in these patients, or that treatment that was initiated for uveitis masked the symptoms of arthritis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also considers pediatric chronic anterior uveitis without systemic symptoms to be comparable to JIA-associated uveitis from a treatment standpoint.[ADDRESS_424711] of this study is JIA-associated uveitis, the inclusion of this secondary group of patients with chronic anterior uveitis (henceforth referred to as ‘CAU’) presenting with the same phenotype will increase generalizability and facilitate enrollment. While methotrexate is the mainstay of long-term, immunomodulatory therapy for JIA-associated uveitis and CAU, previous studies have shown that anywhere from 15-50% of affected children will have refractory uveitis despi[INVESTIGATOR_342938].10–[ADDRESS_424712] suggested the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α may play a role in both JIA and uveitis pathogeneses.14–16 Given its demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials, adalimumab has been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of both JIA and non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis.17 Adalimumab has also been shown to effectively control inflammation in more than 80% of JIA-associated anterior uveitis cases, leading to its approval for use for this indication within the National Health System (NHS) in the [LOCATION_006].18,[ADDRESS_424713] Protocol v1.8 – 14 February 2024 12 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_342939]’s short-term efficacy for treating JIA-associated uveitis and CAU, there is a lack of evidence regarding long-term treatment outcomes for such patients.2,3,18–[ADDRESS_424714] higher rates of adverse events compared to patients on methotrexate alone.25 In addition, anti-TNF-α therapy may harbor a risk of malignancy and opportunistic infection.26–[ADDRESS_424715] in the possible cessation of adalimumab after a patient with JIA-associated uveitis or CAU has achieved disease control. Anti-TNF-α therapy is expensive to the patient and healthcare system.35,36 A single dose of adalimumab costs £350 under NHS England.36 A 2013 study found that, on average, a person with health insurance coverage in the U.S. pays $26,[ADDRESS_424716] a high relapse rate when stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_342940].39–[ADDRESS_424717] disease relapse. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood serve as measures of non-specific, systemic inflammation and have been suggested as predictors of flare in JIA.48,49 The protein complex formed between MRP 8 and MRP 14 (calprotectin) has shown promise as a potential indicator of both relapse of rheumatic disease and response to anti-TNF-α treatment.50–54 Evaluating MRP8/[ADDRESS_424718] found that between 9.2% and 32% of patients on adalimumab treatment developed antibodies against the drug.55–[ADDRESS_424719] Protocol v1.8 – 14 February 2024 13 in patients with JIA-associated uveitis or CAU randomized to either continue their current treatment regimen of adalimumab or discontinue adalimumab. Addressing these clinically relevant research aims will provide a stronger evidence base for informing treatment guidelines for long-term use of adalimumab in patients with JIA-associated uveitis and CAU.  2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS…  Based on product insert information,58 the risks associated with adalimumab treatment include: • Serious infections • Reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis in patients with latent tuberculosis • Malignancies • Hypersensitivity reactions (localized rash, anaphylaxis, and angioneurotic edema) • Injection-site pain • Hepatitis B virus reactivation • Neurologic reactions (multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, peripheral demyelinating disease) • Hematologic reactions (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) • Congestive heart failure • Development of lupus-like syndrome (new formation of autoantibodies) • Liver enzyme and creatinine elevations  Based on product insert information,59 risks associated with methotrexate treatment include: • Infection • Nausea or vomiting • Mild abdominal pain • Dizziness • Diarrhea • Alopecia • Leukopenia • Elevated liver enzymes  • Potential for folic acid deficiency (patients should take folic acid supplements while on methotrexate) • Rarely, an increased risk of severe opportunistic infection • Rarely, an increased risk of cancer  Based on product insert information, risks associated with mycophenolate mofetil include: • Infection • Nausea or vomiting • Mild abdominal pain • Muscle aches • Fatigue • Diarrhea • Hypertension • Leukopenia

The Australian study site is The Royal Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342947].   4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN Justification for placebo treatment: As both patients and those assessing outcomes could introduce bias, complete masking of the treatment is ideal for this study. This concern is especially pertinent for the pediatric population, since it is difficult to prevent young patients from discussing their treatment with their physician. Our primary outcome is time to treatment failure, where treatment failure is defined as a recurrence of ocular inflammation (≥2-step increase in AC cell observed at [ADDRESS_424730] 7 days apart; >0.5+ AC cell for ≥28 days; ≥3+ AC cell observed at a single visit; or >0.5+ vitreous haze, active retinal/choroidal lesions, or macular edema at a single visit) and/or a recurrence of joint inflammation that is persistent and severe enough to necessitate unmasking to manage the arthritis recurrence. While an attempt will be made to ensure the grading of ocular inflammation is as standardized as possible, complete removal of subjectivity in inflammation grading is impossible. Furthermore, we plan to assess adverse events and quality of life as secondary outcomes, which rely on patient self-report. Given that self-report is involved in both the primary and secondary outcome assessments, masking of subjects is also necessary to remove any potential bias in assessing the outcomes for our study.   Justification for superiority: There is clinical utility in determining if one treatment plan is more effective for reducing the risk of recurrence of ocular inflammation. The findings of this trial could provide justification for either stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_342948]-term management of JIA-associated uveitis and CAU, which are chronic conditions.  Therefore, a superiority trial design is warranted.  Potential problems with placebo treatment: We hypothesize that stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_342949] a shorter time to treatment failure and higher uveitis recurrence rates compared to continuing adalimumab. In anticipation of this possibility, we have allowed for patients to restart adalimumab or be treated per best medical judgement for the remainder of the study period. The primary analysis will be intent-to-treat, but we will also collect clinical outcome data at Month [ADDRESS_424731] clinical practice is self-administration of adalimumab subcutaneously at a dose of 40mg every other week for patients ≥30kg and 20mg every other week for patients <30kg.  Patients randomized to stop adalimumab will receive placebo treatment. The volume-matched placebo will be administered subcutaneously for masking purposes every other week.  
 
 NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template                      ADJUST Protocol v1.8 – [ADDRESS_424732] patients will be on the appropriate weight-dependent dose of adalimumab. In the event that a patient is on a higher dose than appropriate for their weight (i.e. 40mg biweekly if <30kg), this dose must be tapered to 20mg biweekly and must be stable for at least 180 days prior to enrollment. In the event that a patient is on a lower dose than appropriate for their weight (i.e. 20mg biweekly if ≥30kg), they may enroll in the trial as long as the dose has been stable for at least [ADDRESS_424733] been inactive (per definitions above) for at least [ADDRESS_424734] weight-based dose. During the course of the study, any patient receiving the lower adalimumab dose (20mg biweekly) who reaches the weight of ≥30kg for at least 2 consecutive visits (≥28 days apart) will be switched to the 40mg biweekly dose strength on their second visit. These requirements will ensure that all patients in the trial receive comparable doses of study treatment and have not had any recent changes to treatment that would affect their outcomes during the trial.  If on a concomitant antimetabolite, patients will continue their same dose and route of administration regardless of treatment arm.

Highly effective contraception methods as defined by [CONTACT_342972], include:  • Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; oral, intravaginal, or transdermal • Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; oral, injectable, or implantable • Intrauterine device (IUD) • Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Vasectomized partner • Abstinence from heterosexual intercourse If abstinence is the selected contraception method, the reliability of this method needs to be evaluated in relation to the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  5.4 SCREEN FAILURES Screen failures are participants who are considered for trial participation and are included in a conversation about the trial, but do not meet all eligibility criteria, including their willingness to participate and comply with all study procedures. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes reason for not enrolling in the trial.  Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of a change in dosing of antimetabolite or adalimumab, use of corticosteroids, or willingness to participate may be screened again at a later time-point if they become eligible.   5.[ADDRESS_424747] approximately 77% of study patients will be female,10 5% African American, 3% Asian, and 11% Hispanic.62 There are no restrictions on eligibility related to sex, race, or ethnicity for this study. All patients meeting eligibility criteria will be given information about the study and an opportunity to participate if interested.   With approximately ten planned enrollment centers in the U.S., nine in the [LOCATION_006], and one in Australia, the anticipated accrual rate is 3-4 patients per month across all centers. U.S. study sites will include the Proctor Foundation at UCSF in San Francisco, CA, Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342950], PA, Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342951], OH, Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342941], MO, the University of Utah Health in Salt Lake City, UT, Colorado Retina Associates in Lakewood, CO, University

The Australian site is The Royal Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342947]. We expect that approximately 51% of participants will be enrolled at the US centers, 43% of participants enrolled at the [LOCATION_006] centers, 6% enrolled in Australia. Patients will be identified, screened, and consented in the outpatient clinic setting.   As patients will be followed for 12 months, study coordinators will obtain two phone numbers, email address (if available), and physical address for all study participants. At the conclusion of each visit, coordinators will schedule and confirm the next follow-up study visit with the patient. Coordinators will call patients two days prior to remind them of upcoming study visits. Patients will also receive a travel reimbursement voucher for each completed study visit.   As JIA-associated uveitis and CAU are pediatric conditions, the target population includes children, a group considered as vulnerable participants according to The Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) definitions. We would not be able to meet the recruitment goals or answer the research aims of this study without the inclusion of children in our study population. An assent form will be provided for children in addition to a consent form to be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_85190]. This informed consent process will ensure children and their parents or guardians understand the risks and benefits of the study and have sufficient information to make an informed decision about whether or not to participate.

The dosage and route of administration is self-administration of adalimumab subcutaneously at a dose of 40mg every other week for patients ≥30kg and 20mg every other week for patients <30kg, which is in accordance with standard clinical practice and its FDA approved indication for treatment of JIA.17 Further detail on justification of dosing is provided in Section 4.3.  Patients randomized to stop adalimumab will receive placebo treatment. The volume-matched placebo will be administered subcutaneously for masking purposes every other week.   Adalimumab is commercially available in the U.S. for treatment of polyarticular JIA and non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in children 2 years of age and older at the aforementioned doses. Adalimumab is commercially available in the [LOCATION_006] for treatment of both polyarticular and oligoarticular JIA in addition to chronic, pediatric anterior uveitis at the aforementioned doses. Adalimumab is commercially available in Australia for treatment of JIA and CAU at the aforementioned doses, with an exception of patients weighing less than 15kg receive 10mg every other week. Given that the use of adalimumab in patients with oligoarticular JIA and anterior uveitis is technically off-label, the Coordinating Center has obtained an Investigational New Drug Approval from the FDA.   The US formula of adalimumab has recently been changed to be citrate-free, which is the same formula that is in use in the [LOCATION_006]. Following this announcement, [COMPANY_013] will be providing citrate-free adalimumab and placebo to all clinical study centers.63–65 To ensure the participants remain completely masked to treatment, the study will provide treatment kits to patients in both arms to standardize the appearance and labeling of adalimumab and the placebo.  6.1.2 DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION The participant’s dose will be selected based on their current weight at the time of randomization. For example, a patient weighing less than 30kg who is randomized to continue adalimumab treatment will receive a dose of 20mg every other week for up to 12 months. If a patient’s weight increases during the trial, the patient must hold the larger weight for two consecutive visits (≥28 days apart) before receiving the higher dose of adalimumab (i.e. 40mg biweekly).   Participants randomized to receive placebo treatment will receive a volume-matched placebo dose subcutaneously every other week for up to [ADDRESS_424750] Protocol v1.8 – 14 February 2024 24 restarting adalimumab will be 40mg every other week for patients ≥30kg or 20mg every other week for patients <30kg.   6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING/STORAGE/ACCOUNTABILITY 6.2.[ADDRESS_424751] with [COMPANY_013], Inc. pharmaceutical company to provide the adalimumab and placebo drug supplies for the duration of the trial. The Coordinating Center (CC) will place a product order through [COMPANY_013] for starting medication stocks, which will be shipped to the drug supplier. CC will email the drug supplier with details on the expected shipment and arrival dates, treatment kit quantities, lot numbers, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659]. The drug supplier will receive the shipment, record all treatment kit numbers, lot numbers, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], and store the treatment kits in a refrigerator designated for medication storage purposes only at a temperature of 36 – 46˚F (2 – 8˚C). The drug supplier will notify the CC of receipt of medication shipment with accurate contents in good condition within [ADDRESS_424752] been disposed of. The CC will review medication dispensing and disposal logs as well as adherence to storage and labeling procedures during site-monitoring visits.   6.2.2 FORMULATION, APPEARANCE, PACKAGING, AND LABELING Adalimumab solution for subcutaneous injection: Adalimumab 20mg and 40mg is a clear, colorless solution provided in a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous injection. The formulation is adalimumab, mannitol, polysorbate 80, and water for injection. The formulation is citrate-free. Each prefilled syringe has a fixed 29-gauge thin wall and ½ inch needle with black protective cover and is intended for a single dose to a single patient. The syringe should be discarded in a sharps container after administration. [COMPANY_013], Inc. is the manufacturer of this product.58  Placebo solution for subcutaneous injection: The placebo solution is a clear, colorless solution provided in a single-use, prefilled syringe for subcutaneous injection provided in the same volume as the adalimumab injections. The placebo is designed to match the characteristics of the citrate-free adalimumab during injection, but its formulation is different. Each prefilled syringe has a fixed 29-gauge thin wall and ½ inch needle with black protective cover and is intended for a single dose to a single patient. The syringe should be discarded in a sharps container after administration. [COMPANY_013], Inc. will prepare the placebo treatment kits for this study. 
 
 NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template                      ADJUST Protocol v1.8 – 14 February 2024 25  Packaging and labeling: Each kit will consist of two prefilled syringes of adalimumab or placebo in a protective carton. Adalimumab is FDA-approved for the treatment of JIA and intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in patients [ADDRESS_424753] information in accordance with GCP and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Labeling will include a kit number and a blank section on the vial and outer packaging for site- and patient-specific details to be completed by [CONTACT_5130].    6.2.[ADDRESS_424754] be maintained under adequate security and stored under conditions specified on the label. Adalimumab or placebo-prefilled syringes are to be stored protected from light at 2˚ - 8˚C/36˚ - 46˚F. Study drugs must not be frozen at any time. Any temperature excursion must be reported to [COMPANY_013] immediately. Study medication should be quarantined and not dispensed until [COMPANY_013] deems the medication as acceptable. In contrast to HUMIRA market product, Adalimumab or placebo pre-filled syringes must not be stored at room temperature until 15 to 30 minutes before injecting (maximum 77˚F/25˚C).   6.2.4 PREPARATION No preparation is required by [CONTACT_342973]. Both active and placebo treatment kits will be provided in prefilled syringes with fixed needles in protective packaging.   6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND MASKING Both randomization and masking will be used in the study design to minimize bias relating to treatment assignment and outcome assessment.   Randomization: Lists of sequential randomization assignments will be prepared for each site. The randomization lists consist of a unique identifier for each patient, together with the assignments to treatment arms. The assignment of patient ID numbers and treatment randomization will be performed at enrollment. Research pharmacists and emergency contacts will be the only study personnel with access to treatment assignments for currently enrolled patients. These study personnel will only be able to access treatment assignments for their own site. The research pharmacist will perform each randomization for their site and will not know treatment assignments prior to enrolling each new patient. At the time of enrollment, the research pharmacist will log into the online REDCap randomization module and perform the randomization to obtain the treatment assignment.   Masking: A placebo treatment will be used to ensure masking of outcome assessors as well as the patients and caregivers. This process will ensure unbiased assessments of inflammation, adverse events, and other secondary outcomes, such as BCVA and quality of life. All participating physicians have unanimously agreed to the use of placebo injections for this trial. We believe that a sufficient number of patients will be willing to participate in a trial with placebo injections, since many previous JIA biologic trials including SYCAMORE were able to successfully enroll patients with a placebo arm.25,66–[ADDRESS_424755] Protocol v1.8 – [ADDRESS_424756] for the trial.   6.5.1 RESCUE MEDICINE Patients randomized to stop adalimumab treatment who fail treatment will be restarted on adalimumab, unless the investigator deems restarting to not be in the patient’s best medical interest. The patient will be restarted on their dose of adalimumab taken prior to randomization. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_342952]. Macular edema is part of the definition of treatment failure and can be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral or injectable medications per investigator discretion. All post-primary outcome care will be determined by [CONTACT_28022]. The ability to regain control of inflammation when restarting treatment is of interest for Aim [ADDRESS_424757] a recurrence of inflammation and want to either restart (for patients randomized to the placebo arm) or continue (for patients randomized to the adalimumab arm) treatment during the trial.   Patients randomized to continue adalimumab who experience treatment failure for safety, intolerability, or efficacy reasons may be treated per best medical judgement with a medication other than adalimumab. Such patients will continue to be followed until Month 12, but the study will not provide any rescue treatments other than open-label adalimumab. All other rescue treatments will be considered part of standard clinical care.   6.5.2 ANTIMETABOLITE THERAPY If patients are on an antimetabolite (methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or leflunomide) the dose and route of administration must be stable for at least 90 days prior to randomization in order to be eligible for the trial. Such patients will continue on their same dose and route of administration throughout the trial. The maximum allowable dose of methotrexate is 25 mg weekly in either oral or injectable form. The maximum allowable dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 3 g/daily. The maximum allowable dose of azathioprine is [ADDRESS_424758] Protocol v1.8 – [ADDRESS_424759] continue to prescribe the concomitant therapy for patients during the trial. Treatment should be recorded on the Treatment Assessment Form.   6.5.3 CORTICOSTEROIDS Patients may use topi[INVESTIGATOR_342953] ≤2 drops daily of 1% prednisolone acetate or other equivalent and has been stable for at least 3 months prior to randomization. If a patient is exposed to systemic corticosteroids, has an ocular injection of a corticosteroid, or increases topi[INVESTIGATOR_342954] 2 drops/day during the course of the study, the study coordinator should record this event as a protocol deviation and report it to the medical monitor and CC. Note, systemic corticosteroids are permitted if prescribed for conditions unrelated to JIA (e.g., allergic reaction, asthma) are if not anticipated to be needed again during the trial.    Local corticosteroid injections to the joints are permitted and is the preferred method of treatment if there is a recurrence of arthritis.   6.5.4 EYE DROPS Investigators may add cycloplegic drops to a patient’s medication regimen if the patient has active inflammation and is at risk for synechiae.  Investigators may also add intraocular pressure-lowering (IOP) drops.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) eye drops are not permitted to be added to a patient’s medication regimen.  All treatment should be recorded on the Treatment Assessment Form.

If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an AE.   Discontinuation due to efficacy: Patients can discontinue the study treatment due to lack of efficacy and be declared a treatment failure if they have recurrence of ocular inflammation (≥2-step increase in AC cell observed at [ADDRESS_424760] 7 days apart; >0.5+ AC cell for ≥28 days; ≥3+ AC cell on a single visit; or >0.5+ vitreous haze, active retinal/choroidal lesions, or macular edema at a single visit) and/or recurrence of joint inflammation that is persistent and severe enough to necessitate unmasking to manage the arthritis recurrence. Patients with ocular inflammation that meets one of the treatment failure thresholds (see Section 3.1) should return for an evaluation to evaluate whether the increased inflammation is sustained (called the Treatment Failure visit), as close to the [ADDRESS_424761] medical judgement. Patients in the placebo arm will be encouraged to restart adalimumab. The date of treatment failure is defined as the date of the initial visit when the ocular inflammation reached the threshold (see Section 3.1). A minimum of 90 days of follow-up is required following treatment failure, so if treatment failure is declared with fewer than 90 days remaining in the 12-month follow-up period, follow-up may be extended to up to 15 months. Regardless of the course of treatment pursued after treatment failure, all patients will be followed through Month 12 or a minimum of 90 days, whichever is longer. Discontinuation due to intolerability: Patients may discontinue their current treatment regimen due to side effects. Once side effects resolve, patients may restart their treatment regimen. Discontinuation for intolerability is NOT a treatment failure. Patients should still complete all study visits through Month 12. Discontinuation due to safety: Patients who experience abnormal lab results meeting the designated threshold of an AE or other AEs such as an opportunistic infection will immediately stop taking both the study treatment and concomitant antimetabolite therapy if applicable. These AEs are often reversible. In the case of non-serious and serious lab AEs, patients may restart medication when the lab results have normalized. Discontinuation for safety reasons is NOT a treatment failure. Patients should still complete all study visits through Month 12. Patients who develop an illness, such as a febrile illness, ≥101°F/38.3°C or an infection requiring antibiotics, should consult their study physician regarding treatment and may stop taking the study medication and antimetabolite per investigator’s discretion. Under the discretion of the investigator, patients should resume treatment as soon as it is determined to be safe.  Note, patients should not stop treatment due to milder illnesses such as upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073] (colds). Additionally, patients who develop any of the following will also discontinue treatment according to the full prescribing information and labeling in the SmPC: serious infections, 
 
 NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template                      ADJUST Protocol v1.8 – 14 February 2024 29 opportunistic infections (including invasive fungal infections) or sepsis, Hepatitis B reactivation, new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure, or central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders. If the investigator determines it is safe for the patient to restart treatment upon resolution of the disorder, the patient will restart. Discontinuation due to reactivation of arthritis: Patients with a history of arthritis may experience a recurrence of arthritis while taking the study treatment regimen. The treating rheumatologist will determine per best medical judgement if a patient needs to discontinue their current treatment regimen due to reactivation of arthritis. Every effort should be made to treat the arthritis with NSAIDS or local corticosteroid injections as opposed to changing the study treatment, antimetabolite treatment, or adding systemic corticosteroids. Reactivation of arthritis only results in treatment failure if it cannot be managed with the aforementioned treatment options. Patients will continue to be followed through Month [ADDRESS_424762]’s best medical judgement.  Patients with CAU who develop arthritis during the study should be treated the same as the JIA patients.    7.1.1 EMERGENCY TREATMENT & UNMASKING In case of an emergency where knowledge of the patient’s randomized treatment assignment is essential to the treatment of the patient, the investigator may willingly become unmasked. This decision to unmask resides solely with the investigator. If unmasking is warranted, the investigator will call their unmasked research pharmacist who can readily unmask the patient’s treatment assignment. The research pharmacist must notify the Coordinating Center if they provide the treatment assignment to the masked investigator. If the research pharmacist is unable to be reached, the investigator may call the Coordinating Center. The Data Analyst is the best contact [CONTACT_342974], as they are unmasked. Based on investigator discretion, the investigator should restrict the number of individuals who become unmasked. The patient should remain in the study, regardless of whether they have been unmasked, if the patient’s safety is not at risk.  As with any unmasking, the investigator must report a Protocol Deviation. See section 10.1.9 for further details on reporting Protocol Deviations.   7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons: • Pregnancy • Significant study intervention non-compliance that endangers the participant • If any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on Patient Dropout Form. Subjects who sign the ICF and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention must continue to be followed as part of the study and will be included in the intent-to-treat analysis.  Subjects who sign the ICF, are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study will not be replaced.

This examination should be similar to that performed in the routine care of patients with uveitis. Several components will be assessed in detail per study protocol. Anterior chamber cell, anterior chamber flare, and vitreous haze will be graded based on Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group inflammation grading schemes.[ADDRESS_424765] any abnormal findings on Clinical Eye Exam Form.  Rheumatologic exam: A pediatric rheumatologist will conduct an exam of joint disease activity at Baseline, Treatment Failure (if applicable) and Months 3, 6, and 12. These exams will occur on the same day as, or as close as possible to, the ophthalmic exam. This exam will include assessment of total active joint count, systemic symptoms such as fever or rash, and other tests or examinations deemed necessary by [CONTACT_342976]. Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) for [ADDRESS_424766] spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BCVA): Trained visual acuity technicians will use the Electronic Visual Acuity (EVA) protocol developed by [CONTACT_342977]-corrected vision in children. Children 7 years of age or older will be tested using the electronic ETDRS option on the EVA system, while children younger than 7 years of age will be tested on the ATS-HOTV option. Refer to MOP Section 6.3 for further details on refraction and visual acuity, including acceptable EVA alternative devices (e.g., M&S, VistaVision, Good-Lite). Optical coherence tomography (OCT): Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a diagnostic imaging technique that produces cross-sectional tomograms of the posterior segment eye structures.  A computer algorithm determines the boundaries of the different layers of the retina and subsequently, retinal thickness and volume data are calculated. Spectral-domain (SD) OCT will be used in this study to monitor the effects of treatment by [CONTACT_342978]. Heidelberg Spectralis SD-OCT unit, Zeiss Cirrus, and TopCon are the approved OCT imaging machines for study assessments.  If there is more than one OCT machine at a site, an effort will be made to use the same machine each time for consistency in measurements. The OCT technician should capture one 20x20 High Speed Volume scan centered on the macula for both eyes at each visit. The study ophthalmologist should record central subfield thickness measurements from the thickness map and structural observations (subretinal fluid, cystoid spaces, epi[INVESTIGATOR_43691]) on OCT Form.  MRP8/14 serum levels: Blood will be drawn to measure MRP8/14 serum levels at Baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Treatment Failure. See MOP Section 6.5 for details on storage, transmission, and analysis of samples.  Blood for biobanking: Blood will be drawn at Baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and treatment failure and kept in biobank storage freezers at each site for future analysis in ancillary biomarker studies. See MOP Section 6.5 for details on storage and transmission of blood samples.  Adalimumab antibody levels: Patients will have blood drawn to test for adalimumab antibody levels at Baseline, Treatment Failure (if applicable), Month 6, and Month 12.

See MOP Section 6.5 for details on transmission and analysis of samples.   Rectal swab: Patients will provide rectal swabs at baseline, Month 12, and Treatment Failure (if applicable) for gut microbiome and human transcriptomes analyses.   Monitoring for arthritis activity: Patients will be assessed for arthritis activity using the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score for 10 and 27 joints (JADAS-10 and -27) by a pediatric rheumatologist.   Quality-of-life questionnaires Quality of life will be measured at Baseline, Month 6, Month 12 and Treatment Failure visits. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) will be assessed in patients 5 years and older using the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ). The EuroQol 5 Dimension Youth Survey (EQ-5D-Y) will also be completed by [CONTACT_1962] 4 years and older. Both of these questionnaires can be taken by [CONTACT_342979]. Vision-related quality of life (VR-QOL) will be assessed in patients using the Children’s Visual Function Questionnaire (CFVQ) for patients aged 3-[ADDRESS_424768] of Youngster’s Eyesight on Quality of Life (EYE-Q) questionnaire for patients 5 years and older.   8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS Review of adverse events: The study coordinator will review each item on Adverse Event Checklist with patients and their caregivers and record it on the CRF. The study coordinator will also record any adverse events that the study ophthalmologist or rheumatologist have observed during the study visit. See Section 8 for further detail on classification and reporting requirements for adverse events.  Serum chemistry and complete blood count: Patients prescribed an antimetabolite will have their blood drawn for a complete blood count and serum chemistry panel approximately every [ADDRESS_424769] these labs done every 6 months—this is standard of care. The 9-month blood draw for standard of care labs can be completed any time between month [ADDRESS_424770] for women of reproductive age: Serum or urine pregnancy test will be administered at every study visit for women post menarche. Study coordinators are required to notify the CC via Serious Adverse Event Narrative in the event of a positive pregnancy test. See Section 8.3.8 for details on pregnancy reporting.  Patient perception of randomized assignment: Prior to unmasking (either at Month 12 or at the treatment failure visit), patients will be asked which treatment group they believe they were randomized to and reason for their guess. The study coordinator will record this information on the Treatment Assessment Form and then the patient and their caregivers will be unmasked.

Examples* may include: • Increased intraocular pressure (>24 mm Hg ) • Abnormal lab findings  (≥ 2 times but < [ADDRESS_424771] or ALT, rise in creatinine to ≥ 1.5 to < 2 mg/dL, reduction of white blood cell count to below 2500) • Concurrent accident or illness  • Increase in the frequency and severity of symptoms of a pre-existing condition  • Side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, fatigue *Additional details on adverse event reporting are provided in the case report form: Adverse Event Checklist.   8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   Below is a list of thresholds for classifying lab values as non-serious and serious:   Non-Serious Adverse Event Serious Adverse Event Leukocytes >1,000 to <2,500/μL  ≤1,000/μL Platelets 20,000 ≥ to ≤75,000/μL  <20,000/μL Hemoglobin ≥ 6.5 to < 9.0 g/dL  <6.5 g/dL SGOT (AST) or SGPT (ALT) ≥2 to <5 times the upper limit of normal ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal Creatinine ≥ 1.5 to < 2 mg/dL ≥ 2 mg/dL  If a lab value surpasses the Non-Serious Adverse Event threshold, the patient must stop their study treatment (adalimumab or placebo), then may resume once levels are below the upper limit of normal. It is recommended to recheck labs weekly following the observation of the elevated lab value. If the lab value remains at the non-serious threshold for more than [ADDRESS_424772] Protocol v1.8 – 14 February 2024 34 8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT  For AEs not included in the protocol-defined grading system, they must be determined to be Serious or Non-serious, using the definitions in sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2.   [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION A determination of the adverse event’s relation to the study product will be made by [CONTACT_342980]. The degree of certainty about association will be graded using the World Health Organization’s Uppsala Monitoring Centre categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be given consideration.  • Certain – The AE occurs in a plausible temporal relationship with the study intervention and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_194486].  • Probable – The AE occurs in a reasonable time sequence with the study intervention and unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_194486].  • Possible – The AE occurs in a reasonable time sequence with the study intervention but could be explained by [CONTACT_194486].  • Unlikely – The AE occurs in a temporal relationship with the study intervention that makes a causal relationship improbable and concurrent disease and/or other drugs provide plausible explanations.   Regardless of the investigator’s decision, patients should continue to be followed through Month 12.  [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS  The Medical Monitor will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the information about adalimumab provided in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). 8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP The occurrence of an AE or SAE (encompassing serious adverse reactions, SARs, and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, S[LOCATION_003]Rs, in the [LOCATION_006]) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  All AEs including local and systemic reactions will be captured on Adverse Event Checklist. All AEs that occur during the study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship and will be categorized as either serious or non-serious. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  Any medical condition present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.   The study coordinator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until [ADDRESS_424773] dose of study medication.  At each study visit, the study coordinator will ask about the occurrence of AE/SAEs

Additional modes of reporting AEs are not required unless classified as an SAE.   8.3.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  The site investigator will immediately report any SAE/S[LOCATION_003]R to the sponsor regardless of relatedness to the study intervention. Reportable events include those listed in the protocol and must involve an assessment of the possibility that the study intervention caused the event. SAEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs (e.g. all-cause mortality) must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study intervention and the event (e.g. death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the sponsor.  All SAEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_342981].  In case of an SAE/S[LOCATION_003]R, Serious Adverse Event Narrative will be completed by [CONTACT_342982] 24 hours of study personnel learning of the SAE/S[LOCATION_003]R.  Information recorded on this form will include the nature of the event, date of onset, date of resolution, date of notification to Medical Monitor, and action taken.  The form will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_1689]. Any significant study drug-related adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_342983] (DSMC) as appropriate.  IRB offices should also be notified according to the policies of each institution.  The study sponsor will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  In addition, the sponsor must notify FDA and all participating investigators in an Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.   The study sponsor is also responsible for notifying the South Central – Berkshire Research Ethics Committee and the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the fatal or life-threatening SAE/S[LOCATION_003]R as soon as possible, but no later than 7 days after the sponsor becomes aware. A CTIMPs Safety Report form should accompany the SAE/S[LOCATION_003]R notification to the main Research Ethics Committee. For non-fatal and non-life-threatening SAEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor should inform the ethics committee and MHRA within [ADDRESS_424775] be reported. The investigator at local [LOCATION_006] sites where the SAE/S[LOCATION_003]R occurs is responsible for following local governance procedures, including notifying their Research & Development department.   8.3.[ADDRESS_424776] Protocol v1.8 – [ADDRESS_424777] the risk-benefit ratio or patients’ willingness to participate in the trial, the CC will prepare a document with standardized language to communicate the information to study participants and IRBs.

The research pharmacist and the coordinator at each clinic will maintain accountability logs of the drug supply inventory, including information on date of receipt, date of expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061], batch/serial numbers, and details of when drugs are dispersed to enrolled patients. The CC will audit the accountability logs, referencing the research pharmacy’s inventory, during in-person site monitoring visits and confirm the drug supply is being stored and dispensed properly.   [IP_ADDRESS] PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE Study personnel will be required to pass a general knowledge assessment prior to trial implementation. If deviations to the protocol occur, the event and a description of it will be reported to the CC (see section 10.1.9). The CC may observe study visits during in-person site monitoring visits to verify adherence to the protocol.     
 
 NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template                      ADJUST Protocol v1.8 – 14 February 2024 45 [IP_ADDRESS] TRIAL SAFETY A masked medical monitor at the CC has been appointed to evaluate the safety of the trial. All serious adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_342996] a timely manner, as defined in section 8.3.6. The medical monitor will determine expectedness of the patient’s treatment and the reported event. The medical monitor will report his findings to the relevant entities defined in section 8.3.6.    The NEI’s appointed DSMC will also review serious adverse events and general trial data on a 6-month basis, or as deemed necessary. Progress reports will be prepared for all scheduled DSMC meetings. An interim analysis will be performed and presented to the DSMC by [CONTACT_20767]’s unmasked biostatistician when approximately 40% of the trial's anticipated events have occurred. Whether or not to continue the trial will be based on this interim analysis. See SAP section 3.7 for details on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  On February 14th, 2024 the DSMC met, stopped enrollment and provided the following guidance for patients still completing follow-up in the trial: o Patients should be told by [CONTACT_342997]. o Patients are encouraged to remain in their assigned treatment group and complete follow-up, per protocol.   o Patients in active follow-up who have not yet been unmasked to their treatment assignment can be asked if they want to know their current treatment assignment. o Patients receiving placebo may opt to discontinue their injections.

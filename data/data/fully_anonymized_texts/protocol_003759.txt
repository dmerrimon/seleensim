 Background :  
 
Below is the abstract from the Phase III VISION trial for 177Lu -PSMA -617 therapy for prostate 
cancer, which Mayo was involved in. This is the seminal trial that led to FDA approval of this new 
therapy.  
 
Metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer remains fatal despi[INVESTIGATOR_103281]. Prostate -
specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in metastatic castration -resistant prostate 
cancer. Lutetium -177 ((177)Lu) -PSMA -617 is a radioligand therap y that delivers beta -particle 
radiation to PSMA -expressing cells and the surrounding microenvironment.  
 
METHODS: We conducted an international, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating (177)Lu -PSMA -
[ADDRESS_198114] inhibitor and one or two taxane  regimens and who had 
PSMA -positive gallium -68 ((68)Ga) -labeled PSMA -11 positron -emission tomographic -computed 
tomographic scans. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either (177)Lu -
PSMA -617 (7.4 GBq every 6 weeks for four to six cycle s) plus protocol -permitted standard care or 
standard care alone. Protocol -permitted standard care excluded chemotherapy, immunotherapy, 
radium -223 ((223)Ra), and investigational drugs. The alternate primary end points were imaging -
based progression -free su rvival and overall survival, which were powered for hazard ratios of 0.[ADDRESS_198115] dose and before subsequent anticancer treatment.  
 
RESULTS: From June 2018 to mid -October 2019, a total of 831 of 1179 screened patients 
underwent randomization. The baseline characteristics of the patients were balanced between the 
groups. The median follow -up was 20.9 months. (177)Lu -PSMA -[ADDRESS_198116] care, both imaging -based progression -free 
survival (median, 8.7 vs. 3.4 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.40; 99.2% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.57; P<0.001) and overall survi val (median, 15.3 vs. 11.3 months; hazard 
ratio for death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.74; P<0.001). All the key secondary end points 
significantly favored (177)Lu -PSMA -617. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or above 
was higher with (177)Lu -PSMA -617 t han without (52.7% vs. 38.0%), but quality of life was not 
adversely affected.  
 
CONCLUSIONS: Radioligand therapy with (177)Lu -PSMA -[ADDRESS_198117] care in patients with 
advanced PSMA -positive metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer. (Funded by [CONTACT_169728], a 
[COMPANY_001] company; VISION ClinicalTrials.gov number, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].).  
 
Study Rationale  
 
This trial is designed to overcome a clinical access issue that would otherwise block patients 
from reimbursement of a new cancer therapy, and therefore block or significantly delay their 
care.  
 
3 Ga-PSMA -11 Pre -Therapy  Version: 3 Date: 9/22/2022  
 On March 23, 2022,  the FDA approved PSMA -targeted radionuclide therapy for the treatment 
of adult patients with prostate -specific membrane antigen (PSMA) -positive  metastatic 
castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been  treated with an androgen receptor 
pathway inhibit or (ARPI)  and taxane -based  chemotherapy.  PSMA -targeted radionuclide 
therapy is also known as 177Lu -PSMA -617, Lutetium Lu 177 Vipi[INVESTIGATOR_169723] , and 
PluvictoTM.  
 
The FDA  approval  of PSMA -targeted radionuclide therapy  was based on the phase III  VISION 
trial (Sartor, de Bono et al. 2021) . In the VISION trial, a specific form of PSMA -targeted PET 
radiotracer was used to evaluate if patients had PSMA -positive prostate cancer prior to PSMA -
targeted radionuclide therapy. The specific form of PSMA -targeted PET radiotracer used in the 
VISION trial was 68Ga -PSMA -11, also known as Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide . 68Ga -PSMA -11 
for the VISION trial was produced with a chemistry kit that  was FDA approved  on March 23, 
2022 , now known as L ocametzTM.  
 
The FDA approval of PSMA -targeted radionuclide therapy specifies to “select patients for 
treatment using L ocametz ® or an approved  PSMA -11 imaging agent based on PSMA 
expression in tumors ”. This FDA language was a surprise, as the medical community expected 
to be able to use any FDA approved PSMA -targeted PET radiotracer for patient selection for 
PSMA -targeted radionuclide therapy, and not be restricted to 68Ga -PSMA -11.  
 
Mayo and many other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], imaging centers and clinical practices have an active PSMA -
targeted PET imaging practice using 18F -PSMA -DCFPyL PET radiotracer. 18F-PSMA -
DCFPyL was FDA approved on May 27, 2021. 18F-PSMA -DCFPyL is also known as, PyL, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_169724] F [ADDRESS_198118] undergone PSMA -targeted PET scans (PET/CT or PET/MR) are likely 
to have received a 18F -PSMA -DCFPyL PET scan. However, the FDA -approval for PSMA -
targeted radionuclide therapy specifies that 68Ga -PSMA -11 PET be used prior to PSMA -
targeted radionuclide therapy.   
 
In order to obtain reimbursement  for and open access to  PSMA -targeted radionuclide therapy 
for appropriate Mayo patients suffering from prostate cancer this issue has to be resolved. 
While Mayo and others seek clarification from Medicare on this issue , many Mayo patients 
would be waiting and suffering.  
 
Therefore,  we are establishing a  protocol, by [CONTACT_169729] a limited number of 
appropriate patients to obtain a 68Ga -PSMA -11 PET/CT scan . The 68Ga -PSMA -11 PET/CT 
scan would be available  even if the patient  had a recent 18F -PSMA -DCFPyL PET scan 
(PET/CT or PET/MR). The 68Ga -PSMA -11 PET/CT scans will be performed at Mayo Clinic in 
[COMPANY_002]ster at the expense of the Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster Nuclear Medicine Division of the 
Department of Radiology. The radiotracer, scan, interpretation,  study coordinator ti me and 
other related costs to run the protocol  will be covered  without expense to the patient . 
 
The 68Ga -PSMA -11 radiotracer will be produced at Mayo Clinic in [COMPANY_002]ster under an active 
IND ( IND 151346 ). This study has been  submitted for FDA review as an extension under the 
4 Ga-PSMA -11 Pre -Therapy  Version: 3 Date: 9/22/2022  
 same IND.  
 
We recognize a patient may, as a result of this protocol , get two PSMA -targeted PET/CT exams 
within a short period of time. This will result in a small amount of additional radiation. 
However, without this scan and extra radiation, there could be a significant delay in access to 
cancer therapy, a therapy which may be li fe extending. It should be recognized that t he PSMA -
targeted radionuclide therapy the patient is planning to undergo results in  a significantly higher 
radiation exposure then the additional P SMA -targeted PET/CT scan  included in this trial.  
 
We intend to make the 68Ga -PSMA -11 PET/CT imaging and interpretation of that imaging  
available in the electronic record for patients and their care team, so they can guide clinical care  
decisions.  
 
We anticipate referrals for 68Ga -PSMA -11 PET/CT under this protocol  to come from Urology, 
Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, and Radiology. We anticipate performing up to six 
68Ga -PSMA -11 PET/CT scans per day. We anticipate this trial will run for up to 12 months.  
Therefore, the total population of patients we plan to scan with 68Ga -PSMA -11 PET/CT is not 
expected to exceed 250.  
 
It is possible we may need to extend this trial and increase the enrollment depending on the 
timing of the anticipated resolution of the Medicare and Insurance limitations on coverage 
described above. Alternatively, when our ability to produce an FDA approved version of 68Ga -
PSMA -[ADDRESS_198119] limitations in 
terms of access to  PET/CT. Thus, we will perform the majority of, or all of  these 68Ga -PSMA -
11 PET/CT exams within the research facilities of the PET Imaging Resource on Charlton 6.  
 
Primary Endpoint: Safety  
 
Measurement: Monitoring of patients for self -reported unexpected adverse reactions from the  
time of injection until the time they leave the care of the Division of Nuclear Medicine.  If any  
adverse reactions are reported, the patient will be evaluated by a nurse and/or physician and will  
receive appropriate care.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_169725] 68Ga -
PSMA -11.  
 
To date we have seen no adverse reactions to IV administered 68Ga -PSMA -[ADDRESS_198120] administered over 400 doses.  
 
68Ga -PSMA -11 Administration  
 
5 Ga-PSMA -11 Pre -Therapy  Version: 3 Date: 9/22/2022  
 The injected dose will be 185 MBq (5 mCi) (range 111 -259 MBq; 3 -7 mCi) of 68Ga -PSMA -
11. PET imaging will begin 50 -100 minutes after injection. A use of existing Central/  PI[INVESTIGATOR_169726]  68Ga-PSMA -11 administration.  
We may repeat  a 68Ga -PSMA -11 injection  and PET/CT  in either  of the following  circumstances:  
- The patient had an unavoidable delay in care (such as a motor vehicle accident) and there  
is evidence or clinical concern that the patient’s cancer significantly progressed  or 
responded to therapy  in a way  that could  affect  management  of his cancer.  
- The patient still meets the criteria for enro llment in the study and [ADDRESS_198121] 68Ga -PSMA -11 injection.  
 
68Ga -PSMA -11 PET/CT protocol  
 
The established 68Ga -PSMA -11 PET/CT imaging protocol will be followed. The scans will be 
performed on the Siemens VISION 600 PET/CT or GE DMI PET/CT on Charlton [ADDRESS_198122] clinical PET/CT protocol 
parameters. The exams will cover the orbits to thighs, unless otherwise specified by [CONTACT_140059]/Nuclear Medicine physician protocoling the specific  exam for a given patient.

Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring and Reporting  
 
The site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_169727]/all serious adverse events to the IRB 
and IND sponsor as described within the protocol, regardless of attribution to study agent or 
treatment procedure.  
 
The sponsor/sponsor -investigator is responsible for notifying FDA and all participating 
investigators in a written safety report of any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and 
unexpected.  
 
Definitions:  
Adverse Event : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Note: An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An  adverse event can arise from any 
use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
  
Suspected Adverse Reaction : Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the adverse event.  
  
Note: For purposes of IND safety reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, defined below.  
  
Unexpected : An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if  
7 Ga-PSMA -11 Pre -Therapy  Version: 3 Date: 9/22/2022  
 • It is not listed in the investigator brochure or.  
• Is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or,  
• If an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan (protocol) or elsewhere in the 
current IND application (as amended).  
  
Serious  (previously SAE): An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ 
if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death,  
• A life-threatening  adverse event,  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] (Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), or  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Life-Threatening : An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ 
if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death.  
 
Note: It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Attribution to agent or procedure:  
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is related to a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR 
Part 312)  
NOTE:  Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, 
whether or not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 
312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:  
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
8 Ga-PSMA -11 Pre -Therapy  Version: 3 Date: 9/22/2022  
 5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
interve ntion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 
312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL  SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to 
the sponsor within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

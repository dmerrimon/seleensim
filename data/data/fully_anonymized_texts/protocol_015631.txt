1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Neurocognitive Effects of Whole -Brain Radi otherapy (WBRT)   
Whole -brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the most widely used treatment option for patients 
with multiple brain metastases (Sundstrom 1998).  In addition to providing rapid 
palliation of neurologic symptoms and improved local control as an adjuv ant to resection 
or radiosurgery, WBRT also prolongs time to neurocognitive function (NCF) decline 
(Aoyama 2007).  As such, NCF and quality of life are correlated in patients with brain 
metastases receiving WBRT, with deterioration in NCF preceding self -reported quality of 
life decline by [CONTACT_8622] 153 days. (Li 2008).  Hence, there is a sequential association 
between NCF decline and deterioration in self -reported quality of life for patients with 
brain metastasis.  These results demonstrate that delaying NCF d ecline results in net 
clinical benefit important for preserving quality of life for patients with brain metastasis.   
 
However, NCF decline can also be a sequela of WBRT; the time course of this varies 
based on the specific domains being measured.  There i s a component of early 
neurocognitive decline, within the first [ADDRESS_683351] also been des cribed (Roman 1995).  
DeAngelis et al. (1989) suggested that as many as 11% of long -term brain metastases 
survivors (>12 months) treated with WBRT develop severe dementia, especially with the 
use of larger dose -per-fraction schedules.  The analysis of WBRT -induced NCF decline 
can be confounded by [CONTACT_526633]: 1) patients with brain metastases tend to have reduced 
NCF at the time of presentation, and 2) disease progression will negatively skew 
population distributions of NCF scores.   
 
In an attempt to disen tangle these confounding effects, a detailed analysis was published 
of the time course of NCF decline in eight prospectively measured domains in 208 brain 
metastases patients treated with 30 Gy of WBRT (Li 2007).  NCF, assessed by [CONTACT_526634], executiv e function, and fine motor coordination, was correlated with metastasis 
volume regression as measured by [CONTACT_9252]. NCF and survival were 
compared in 135 patients evaluable at 2 months with tumor shrinkage less than (poor 
responders) and g reater than (good responders) the population median. The mean NCF 
scores and brain metastasis volume at 4 and 15 months were compared. Good responders 
experienced significantly improved survival (unidirectional p = 0.03).  For all tests, the 
median time to  NCF deterioration was longer in the good than in the poor responders, 
with statistical significance seen for executive and fine motor functions. In long -term 
survivors, defined as patients surviving more than 15 months, tumor shrinkage was 
significantly c orrelated with preservation of executive function and fine motor 
coordination (r = 0.68 -0.88).  These findings support two important possibilities.  First, 
achieving local control with WBRT was integral to both improving survival and 
preserving certain NCF  domains.  Second, an intriguing exception to these findings was 
memory function, specifically recall and delayed recall as assessed with the Hopkins 
Verbal Learning Test (HVLT -R).  These NCF domains appeared to have a weaker 
association with tumor reducti on and were the most susceptible to early decline, even in 
patients with non -progressing brain metastases, implying the selective effect of WBRT in 
preserving certain domains over others and the differential sensitivity of certain domains 
to radiation effe cts. 
 
Further evidence of the early susceptibility of memory function to WBRT was recently 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_526635] (2009).  They reported a single -institution phase 
III trial of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with or without WBRT in patients with one to 
Page | 7  
 three brain metastases, with the principal objective of comparing NCF decline between 
the two arms.  Utilizing HVLT -R as a neurocognitive metric for learning and memory, 
they defined NCF decline as a >5 point drop 3 months from baseline. Their study was 
halted early due to an interim observation of a two -fold increase in the mean probability 
of NCF decline (49%, SRS+WBRT, vs 23%, SRS alone).  Similar findings were reported 
by [CONTACT_526636]. (2008), who observed a decline in verbal memory function , as assessed 
by [CONTACT_526637] (AVLT) [ADDRESS_683352] that, although 
achievement of macroscopic lesion control is an important treatment aim, strategies 
meant to preserve memory -related NCF warrant further investigation.  
 
1.2 Rationale for Hippocampal Avoidance During WBRT   
Emerging evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of radiation -induced NCF deficit may 
involve radiation -induced injury to proliferat ing neuronal progenitor cells in the 
subgranular zone of the hippocampi (Mizumatsu 2003; Raber 2004).   It has been found 
that relatively small doses of radiation cause apoptosis in the subgranular zone of young 
rats and mice (Mizumatsu 2003; Ferrer 1993; Nagai 2000).  On the other hand, little to no 
apoptosis is observed in other areas of the cerebrum (Nagai 2000).  In particular, it has 
been noted that irradiation causes a sharp and prolonged decline in neurogenesis in the 
subgranular zone (Ferrer 1993; N agai 2000; Abayomi 1996; Madsen 2003; Monje 2002; 
Peissner 1999; Tada 2000).  Clinical studies suggest that radiation -induced damage to the 
hippocampus plays a considerable role in the cognitive decline of patients. In particular, 
deficits in learning, mem ory, and spatial processing observed in patients who have 
received WBRT are thought to be related to hippocampal injury (Roman 1995; Abayomi 
1996).  Moreover, irradiation of the hippocampus has been associated with pronounced 
cognitive impairment in the le arning and memory domain in patients receiving radiation 
therapy for nasopharyngeal tumors (Lee 1989; Leung 1992), maxillary tumors (Sakata 
1993), pi[INVESTIGATOR_44079] (Grattan -Smith 1992), and base of skull tumors (Meyers 2000).  
Preliminary results from a re cent MD Anderson study of low -grade or anaplastic brain 
tumors treated with radiotherapy have observed a dose -response phenomenon, wherein 
the maximum radiation dose to the left hippocampus was correlated with subsequent 
decline in learning (p = 0.014) and  delayed recall (p = 0.01) (Mahajan 2007).  
 
Monje and colleagues (2002) found that radiation injury to the hippocampus in Fisher 
344 rats leads to structural alterations of the microenvironment of the “stem cell niche” of 
the hippocampus that regulates pro genitor -cell fate; one consequence of this is decreased 
neurogenesis. Monje and colleagues (2003) went on to show that neurogenesis is 
inhibited by [CONTACT_526638]. This 
inhibition occurred whether the infl ammation was induced by [CONTACT_526639]. Hence, inflammatory injury of the hippocampus putatively 
represents a possible mechanism for the domain -wise differential benefit in NCF, as well 
as the temporal sequence of event s, following WBRT.   
 
We propose to use conformal avoidance of the hippocampal region during whole brain 
radiotherapy to reduce the dose to the hippocampi, thereby [CONTACT_526640] -induced inflammation of the hippocampal region and subsequ ent alteration of 
the microenvironment of the neural progenitor cells.  We hypothesize that avoidance of 
the hippocampal region with WBRT may delay or reduce the onset, frequency, and/or 
severity of NCF decline, as measured with clinical neurocognitive too ls.

 Randomized trials involving WBRT with or without Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) 
(Andrews 2004, Kondziolka 1999) in patients with multiple brain metastases have been 
published, and demonstrate impro ved local control for patients receiving SRS in addition 
to WBRT. Randomized trials involving SRS +/ - WBRT in patients with multiple brain 
metastases show that the addition of WBRT reduces the risk of intracranial relapse 
(Aoyama 2007) at the expense of de creased neurocognition (Chang 2009).  
Intensity modulation can be utilized to deliver a dose of radiation to the whole brain to 
control microsopic disease while simultaneous delivering a boost of radiation all 
radiographically evident brain metastases. Addi tionally, intensity modulated radiation 
therapy (IMRT) can be utilized to spare the structures responsible for memory -related 
neurocognition. The technical feasibility of this approach has been reported for a variety 
of flavors of intensity modulation, inc luding helical tomotherapy (Rodrigues 2010, 
Gutierrez 2007), as well as volumetric modulated arc therapy (Lagerwaard 2009, Hsu 
2010). Boost doses comparable to radiosurgery are generally achievable, with the 
possibility of delineation and avoidance of the hippocampal regions thought to be related 
to radiation -induced neurocognitive decline. There is a logistic advantage to the 
simultaneous integrated boost in that it can be administered in a single course of 
radiotherapy rather than a combination of convent ionally fractionated radiotherapy and 
radiosurgery. Additionally, the treatment can be administered with linear accelerators that 
are common in most community -practice settings. There is a dosimetric advantage as 
well, in that the composite plan can be ful ly optimized to achieve a relatively 
homogenous whole brain dose, a steep gradient for the radiographically evident disease, 
and adequate hippocampal sparing, all at once.  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_683354] During WBRT  
 
In gen eral, hippocampal avoidance poses important challenges in conformally avoiding 
the centrally located hippocampus with its unique anatomic shape, while allowing for 
uniform dose delivery to the remainder of the brain.  In a recent dosimetric analyses of 30 
Gy in 10 fractions prescribed to the whole brain, intensity -modulated radiotherapy 
(IMRT) allowed for the delivery of highly conformal dose distributions, maintaining the 
hippocampal volume receiving 10 Gy or higher (V10) to less than 50% and the maximum 
dose to the hippocampus to less than 16 Gy (Gondi 2010a).  Coupling hippocampal 
avoidance with a more heterogenous plan than delivers a higher volume to 
radiographically evident disease has also been demonstrated in a single treatment plan 
(Gutierrez 2007).   Multiple institutions have also demonstrated the feasibility of WBRT 
with hippocampal avoidance utilizing LINAC -based IMRT delivery systems broadly 
available at multiple academic and community radiation oncology practices (Gondi 
2010a). Incorporating an integrated boost into a WBRT with hippocampal avoidance has 
been demonstrated as well (Hsu 2010).  
 
Avoiding the hippocampus poses the risk of attenuating the benefit of WBRT due to 
increased metastatic disease within the hippocampal conformal avoidance reg ion.  The 
magnitude of this risk has been reported in a study reviewing the MR images of [ADDRESS_683355] (Ghia 2007).  T1 -
weighted, three -dimensional spoiled gradient, post -contrast axial MRI images with a 1 .25 
mm slice thickness, obtained prior to radiotherapy, were reviewed.  In the 100 patients, 
272 metastases were identified and analyzed.  Out of the 272 metastases, 3.3% were 
within 5 mm of the hippocampi (n=9); 4.4% of metastases were between 5 to 10 mm 
from the hippocampi (n=11); and 6.3% of metastases lay between 10 and 15 mm from the 
hippocampi (n=17).  Of all metastases, 86.4% were greater than 15 mm from the 
hippocampi (n=235).  However, none of the metastases lay within the hippocampi.  The 
upper 95 % confidence limit for the risk of finding a metastatic lesion within 5 mm of the 
hippocampi [INVESTIGATOR_526622] 15.2%.  An update of this study reported on 
an additional 271 patients with up to 10 brain metastases (Gondi 2010b).  Of these 
Page | [ADDRESS_683356] one brain 
metastasis within 5 mm of the hippocampi [INVESTIGATOR_526623].  This yielded an 
incidence of 8.6%, allowing for the tightening of the estimated upper 95% confid ence 
limit to 11.5%.  From this, it can be concluded that 91% of newly diagnosed patients will 
be eligible for the WBRT that avoids the hippocampus.  Patients who present with 
perihippocampal or hippocampal brain metastases will not be eligible for this pr otocol.  
 
Although response rates after WBRT without hippocampal avoidance vary, complete or 
partial responses have been documented in more than 60% of patients in randomized 
controlled studies conducted by [CONTACT_111557], with intracranial disease control observ ed in 
approximately 50% of patients at 6 months (Khuntia 2006).  It is currently not possible to 
provide a direct estimate of the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a metastasis after hippocampal 
avoidance WBRT, since such a comprehensive data set does not exist.  However , if we 
assume that the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_526624], from our data on 
the distribution of brain metastases relative to the hippocampus at presentat ion, we can 
conclude that a patient treated with hippocampal WBRT will derive 91.4% of the relative 
benefit of WBRT in terms of radiographically evident intracranial lesions, with a lower 
95% confidence limit of 88.5% (Gondi 2010b).   As the overall aim is  to improve the 
interval to NCF decline, we hypothesize that hippocampal avoidance WBRT will provide 
a net gain in this endpoint.  Furthermore, the modest increase in risk of intracranial 
progression with hippocampal avoidance may be partially compensated by [CONTACT_526641].  Should salvage SRS be indicated for a perihippocampal 
recurrence, we expect that, given the very steep radiation dose falloff with SRS, some but 
not all of the benefit of hippocampal avoidance will be lost.

(HVLT -R) test that has been used and validated in the phase III trial of motexafin 
gadolinium for patients with brain metasta ses.  In this trial, compliance with NCF testing 
was 87% to 98% at baseline and 77% to 87% at 6 months (Meyers 2004).  Our reasons 
for using this particular NCF test include: 1) its ease of use, 2) our institutional 
experience with its administration, and 3) its validation by [CONTACT_526642] a prior multi -
institution study. In RTOG 0018, a phase II trial to evaluate the feasibility of 
neurocognitive testing of brain metastasis patients receiving WBRT in the cooperative 
group setting, compliance was >90% pri or to WBRT, >84% at the completion of WBRT, 
and >78% at one month after WBRT.  Most non -compliance was attributed to patient -
related factors such as decline in performance status (Regine 2004).  
 
The version of the HVLT -R used in the phase III trial of mote xafin gadolinium for 
patients with brain metastases, which for consistency and study comparability will be 
used in the present study, incorporates 6 different forms, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_526625].  Each form includes 12 n ouns (targets) with [ADDRESS_683358] of 12 targets for 3 consecutive trials (immediate recall), identifying the 
[ADDRESS_683359] of semantically related or unrelated items (immediate recognition), 
and recalling the 12 targets after a 20 -minute delay (delayed recall). Raw scores are 
derived for total recall, delayed recall, retention (percentage retained), and a recognition 
discrimination index.  Each patient  will serve as his/her own control, as the difference in 
scores obtained at baseline and at pre -specified post -treatment intervals will be 
calculated.  
 
Prior to initiation of treatment, all patients will undergo baseline NCF testing using a test 
battery c onsisting of the HVLT -R, Trail Making Test (TMT), Controlled Word 
Association Test (COWAT), and Mini -Mental Status Examination (MMSE).  At that 
time, history regarding level of education reached will also be obtained.  After

conducted by [CONTACT_526643], at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 
24 months.  In the analysis of NCF decline, each patient will serve as his/her own control, 
as NCF for e ach test at each follow -up time point will be compared to baseline NCF.  
 
1.6 Fatigue Assessment  and Quality of Life Assessment  
 
Fatigue will be assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI -20).   
 
The MFI -20 is a multidimensional, self -report  instrument designed to measure fatigue. It 
covers the following dimensions: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, 
Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. A subscore from 4 to 20 is reported for each 
dimension, with 20 corresponding to maxima l fatigue.  
 
Within 2 weeks prior to WBRT -HA/SIB, all patients will undergo a baseline fatigue 
assessment.  After completion of WBRT -HA/SIB, all patients will undergo fatigue 
assessments at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months.   
 
Quality of life will be assessed usi ng the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with 
Brain Subscale (FACT -BR) and the Euroqol EQ -5D .The FACT -BR is a 
multidimensional, self -report quality of life instrument specifically designed and 
validated for use with brain malignancy patients. It is written at the 4th grade reading 
level and can be completed in 5 -10 minutes with little or no assistance in patients who are 
not neurologically incapacitated. It measures quality of life related to symptoms or 
problems across 5 scales: physical well -being (7 items); social/family well -being (7 
items);emotional well -being (6 items); functional well -being (7 items); and concerns 
relevant to patients with brain tumors (23 items). Items are rated on a 5 -point scale: 0 -
“not at all”, 1 - “a little bit”, 2 -“somewha t”, 3-“quite a bit” and 4 -“very much”. FACT -BR 
is self -administered and does not require pre -certification.  It has been translated into 26 
languages and is available free of charge to institutions with the completion of an 
agreement to share data, accessi ble at:

Utility  EQ-5DL (self reported)  [ADDRESS_683361] a differential sensitivity of various 
neurocognitive domains, such as delayed recall, to WBRT.  This provides the rationale to 
explore the clinical feasibility of hippocampal avoidance during WBRT.  The dosimetric 
capabilities of IMRT to conformally avoid the hippocampus without detriment to the 
Page | [ADDRESS_683362] also estimated the theoretical risk of perihippocampal 
disease progression with h ippocampal avoidance.  Given the overall aim of prolonging 
neurocognitive decline, and the possibility of salvaging hippocampal and 
perihippocampal recurrences with radiosurgery, we hypothesize that WBRT with HA and 
SIB (WBRT -HA/SIB) will provide a net gai n in this endpoint.  
 
In this phase II study, we plan to treat patients with brain metastases with WBRT -
HA/SIB.  To assess the utility of WBRT -HA/SIB, a comparison of these endpoints with 
historical data of WBRT without hippocampal avoidance will be necessa ry to determine 
whether a phase III prospective randomized trial of WBRT with and without 
hippocampal avoidance would be warranted, and if so, what statistical considerations 
would be needed.  We plan to utilize data from the control arm (WBRT alone) of a recent 
phase III trial (PCI -P120 -9801) of motexafin gadolinium and WBRT (30 Gy/10 
fractions) versus WBRT alone in 401 patients with brain metastasis (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_526626]) (Mehta 
2003; Mehta 2002).  These phase III data serve as a particularly useful control for our 
phase II study, given the similarities in inclusion criteria and study design.

clinical target volume excluding the hippocampal avoidance regions) is 20 Gy in 10 
fraction s.  Treatment will be delivered once daily, 5 fractions per week, over 2 to 
2.5 weeks.  Breaks in treatment should be minimized.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The prescription dose for each metastasis planning target volume (PTV1, PTV2, 
etc.) is [ADDRESS_683373].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Coverage is considered adequate when 95% of each of the PTVs is covered by [CONTACT_526649] (D95% = prescription dose).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The minimum dose to 98% of each of the PTVs (D98%) is 80% of the assigned 
prescr iption dose.  
 
6.2 Technical Factors  
6.2.1  Megavoltage equipment capable of delivering static intensity modulation with a 
multileaf collimator or dynamic intensity modulation (using a multileaf collimator) is 
required.  The use of custom -made compensators o r partial transmission blocks is also 
acceptable as long as dose specifications and constraints are satisfied.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_683374] enhanced images sh ould be used for targeting of gross lesions.  T2 images 
may also be used when they allow clear demarcation of the edge of the targeted 
tumor(s).  These imaging sequences should be obtained within two weeks of initiating 
treatment.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_683375] be acquired 
with the patient in the same position and immobilization device as for treatment.  This 
should be obtained within 2 weeks of initiating treatment.  
6.3.3  The MRI (see Section 6.2.3) and treatment -planning CT should be fuse d semi -
automatically for hippocampal contouring.  
 
6.4 Target Volumes  
6.4.1  The Whole Brain Clinical Target Volume (CTVwb) is defined as the whole brain 
parenchyma to C1 (if no posterior fossa metastasis) or C2 (if MRI evidence of 
posterior fossa metastasis ). 
6.4.2  The Whole Brain Planning Target Volume (PTVwb) is defined as the CTV excluding 
the hippocampal avoidance regions (see Section 6.5.2).  
6.4.3  Each brain metastasis identified on MRI will be assigned a unique Clinical Target 
Volume identified by [CONTACT_526650] (CTV1, CTV2, etc.)  
6.4.4  Each metastasis Planning Target Volume (PTV1, PTV2, etc.) is defined as the 
corresponding CTV with a uniform 2 mm margin.  
 
6.5 Critical Structures  
Page | [ADDRESS_683376] image set by [CONTACT_526651].   
6.5.2  Hippocampal avoidance regions will be generated by [CONTACT_14774] -dimensionally expanding 
the hippocampal contours by 5 mm.   
6.5.3  The lenses and orbits will be c ontoured as per the clinical experience of the treating 
physician. Care should be taken to minimize the dose to the lens and orbits.  
 
6.6 Documentation Requirements  
6.6.1  Verification orthogonal films or images are required.  For all forms of IMRT dose 
delivery, orthogonal films or images that localize the isocenter placement shall be 
obtained.  The length of the treatment field shall be indicated on these films.  
 
6.7 Final Quality Assurance Analysis  
6.7.1  All final treatment plans and contours will be rev iewed after initiation of WBRT -
HA/SIB.  
6.7.2  If unacceptable deviations of MRI/CT fusion, hippocampal contours, and/or 
WBRT -HA/SIB IMRT planning are found on final quality assurance analysis, that 
patient will be rendered inevaluable on final data analysis .

on the submitted MRI/CT fusion, and a comparison will be made to the submitted contours.  
 
6.9 Radiation Therapy Interruptions  
6.9.1  Radiotherapy will be continued without interruption if at all possible.   
Page | 17  
 6.9.2  If the sum total  of radiotherapy interruptions exceeds -7 normally scheduled treatment 
days, the treatment will be considered an unacceptable deviation from the protocol. 
This should be reported to the Principal Investigator, and the patient will be considered 
inevaluable  on final data analysis.   
 
6.10 Radiation Therapy Adverse Events  
6.10.1  Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or 
procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or 
procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite).  
6.10.2  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
6.10. 2.1 Any adv erse experience occurring during any part of protocol treatment and 30 
days after that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death;  
 A life -threatening adverse experience;  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
 A persiste nt or significant disability/incapacity;  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6.10.3  Expected Adverse Events  
6.10. 3.1 Acute, ≤ 90 days from treatment start : Expected adverse events include hair loss, 
erythema of the scalp, head ache, nausea and vomiting, lethargy, and transient 
worsening of neurologic deficits.  Reactions in the ear canals and on the ear should 
be observe d and treated symptomatically.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Late, > 90 days from treatment start : Possible adverse events include radiation 
necrosis, cognitive dysfunction, visual difficulties, accelerated atherosclerosis, and 
radiation -induced neoplasms.  
6.10.[ADDRESS_683378] be reported regardless of 
designation (expected or unexpected) along with the attribution. This includes all 
deaths that occur wi thin [ADDRESS_683379] be completed (the CRF plus information describing th e event, the 
grade, and the attribution) within 48 hours  of the investigator ’s awareness of the 
occurrence of the event.  
6.10.6  Attribution of an event can be categorized as:  
 Not Related  
 Possibly Related  
 Probably Related  
 Definitely Related  
6.10.7  Adverse events (below grade 3) do not need to be submi tted immediately.  Rather, they 
should be documented in the Adverse Events Clinical Report Form (CRF) along with a 
brief description of the event, grade, and attribution).

11.0 PATIENT ASSESSM ENTS  
11.1 Study Parameters : See Appendix I.  
11.2 Neurocognitive Evaluation  
11.2.1  Summary of Required Neurocognitive Tests for All Patients  
 The tests will be used to assess neurocognitive function.  These tests are to be 
administered by a certified examiner (a health care professional such as a physician, 
nurse or dat a manager certified to administer the tests) Certification  from other 
RTOG/ECOG studies is acceptable ,  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT -R) 
The HVLT -R incorporates 6 different forms, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_526628].  Each  form includes 12 nouns (targets) with [ADDRESS_683380] of 12 targets for 3 consecutive trials 
(immediate recall), identifying the [ADDRESS_683381] of semantically related or 
unrelated items (immediate recognition), and recalling the 12 targets after a 20 -
minute delay (delayed recall). Raw scores are derived for total recall, delayed recall, 
retention (percentage retained), and a recogni tion discrimination index.  Each 
patient will serve as his/her own control, as the difference in scores obtained at 
baseline and at pre -specified post -treatment intervals will be calculated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Trail Making Test (TMT)  
This is a measure of visuospatial scanni ng, attention, sequencing, and speed Part A 
and executive function in Part B. Patients must “connect the dots” either in a 
numbered sequence or alternating letters and numbers. Generally Part A and Part B 
require less than 5 minutes, and Part A is disconti nued at 3 minutes, Part B at 5 
minutes, to reduce burden on patients with significant cognitive impairment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Controlled Word Association Test (COWAT)  
The patient produces as many words as possible in 1 min. (each) for a specific letter 
(C, F, L or P, R, W) . Requires about 5 min to complete. Assesses language and 
executive/frontal skills.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mini -Mental Status Examination (MMSE)  
This is a brief, standardized tool to grade patients’ global cognitive function. [ADDRESS_683382] of memory 
(immediate recall) by [CONTACT_292518] [ADDRESS_683383] is then asked to recall the three item s previously repeated (delayed recall). The 
final section evaluates aphasia and apraxia by [CONTACT_292519], repetition, compliance 
with a [ADDRESS_683384] and this is not a validated metric like the others.  
 
 
11.3 Fatigue Evaluation  
Fatigue will be assessed using the Multidimensio nal Fatigue Inventory (MFI -20). 
11.3.1  Summary of Required Fatigue Evaluations For All Patients  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI -20) 
The MFI -20 is a multidimensional, self -report instrument designed to measure 
fatigue. It covers the following dimensions: G eneral Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, 
Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. A subscore from 4 to 
20 is reported for each dimension, with 20 corresponding to maximal fatigue.  
 
Page | 19  
 11.4 Quality of Life Assessments  
11.4.1  Summary of Quality of Life  Assessments  
       [IP_ADDRESS]    FACT -BR (Appendix VI)  
The FACT -BR is a multidimensional, self -report QOL instrument specifically 
designed and validated for use with brain malignancy patients. It is written at the 
4th grade reading level and can be complete d in 5 -10 minutes with little or no 
assistance in patients who are not neurologically incapacitated. It measures 
quality of life related to symptoms or problems across 5 scales: physical well -
being (7 items); social/family well -being (7 items); emotional w ell-being (6 
items); functional well -being (7 items); and concerns relevant to patients with 
brain tumors (23 items). Items are rated on a five -point scale: 0 -“not at all”, 1 - 
“a little bit”, 2 -“somewhat”, 3 - “quite a bit” and 4 -“very much”. FACT -BR is 
self-administered and does not require precertification. It has been translated 
into 26 languages and is available free of charge to institutions with the 
completion of an agreement . Form is available in English and Spanish.  
      [IP_ADDRESS]  EQ-5D (Appendix VI I) 
The EQ -5D health related quality of life questionnaire will be used as well.  EQ -
5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. 
Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a 
simple descriptive pro file and a single index value for health status. .  The US 
version of the EQ -5D will be used, to enable mappi[INVESTIGATOR_526629] -QoL 
scores from EQ -5D scores into health state utility scores (ranging from 0 to 1) 
for the US population.  These utility scores a re needed for cost -utility analysis 
(estimates of costs per “quality adjusted” life -year gained).  Form is available in 
English and Spanish.  This form can be completed in less than 5 minutes and is a 
two page questionnaire.  
          
11.5 Administration o f Neurocognitive, Fatigue, and Quality of Life Assessments  
11.5.1 Timing  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to initiation of treatment, all patients will undergo baseline neurocognitive , 
fatigue , and quality of life  testing using this test battery.  At that time, history rega rding level 
of education reached will also be obtained.  After completion of radiotherapy, all patients will 
undergo neurocognitive and fatigue evaluation at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after WBRT -
HA/SIB.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Examiners will give patients a short break if the patient appears fatigued or 
otherwise in need of a few -minutes break.  
 
 
11.6 Measurement of Response  
Patients will undergo brain MRI prior to study entry (the MRI obtained for hippocampal 
contouring can be used for this purpose) and every 3 months u ntil death or until 2 years 
after WBRT -HA/SIB, whichever comes first.  
11.6.1 Criteria for CNS Progression  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment  
The the bidimensional product for each of the [ADDRESS_683385] dimension that is perpendicular to it (the 
largest dimension).  This value will be recorded on the baseline form and every 
subsequent follow -up form.  The appearance (yes/no and number) of any new brain 
metastases within the whole brain minus the hipposcampal region will be recorded 
on all follow -up forms.  The appearance (yes/no and number) of any new brain 
metastases within the hippocampal avoidance region (the hippocampus p lus 5 mm) 
will be recorded on all follow -up forms.  
 
Recurrences will be categorized as either within the hippocampal avoidance region 
or elsewhere within the brain. Therefore, there will be 3 kinds of local recurrences 
Page | 20  
 reported: a) in the brain, b) in the hippocampal avoidance region, and c) elsewhere 
in the brain . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of CNS Progression  
CNS progression will be defined as a defined increase (see below) in perpendicular 
bidimensional tumor area for any of the tracked brain metastases, or the appearance 
of any new brain metastasis on a follow -up MRI.   
 
For lesions < 1cm in maximum diameter, a minimum increase of 50% of 
perpendicular bi -dimensional treatment area will be necessary to score as 
progression.  This caveat is included to account for  potential variability in 
measurement, which will be most susceptible to proportionate errors at smaller 
sizes.  
 
For lesions > 1cm in maximum diameter, the definition will use a 25% rule for 
change.  
 
11.7 Criteria for Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment  
11.7.1 Unacceptable adverse event to the patient (at the discretion of the treating physician) —
Reasons for removal must be clearly documented on the appropriate case report 
form/flowsheet.  
11.7.2 Interruption of treatment of >3 days  
 
 If protocol treatment  is discontinued, follow -up and data collection will continue as 
specified in the protocol but the patient will be considered inevaluable.

13.[ADDRESS_683387] e Size  
The primary endpoint will be delayed recall, as measured by [CONTACT_526652] (percent) change 
in HVLT -R delayed recall score from the start of treatment to 3 months after the start of 
treatment.  
 
The sample size calculation will address the specific pr imary hypothesis that WBRT -
HA/SIB reduces decline in delayed recall (from baseline to 3 months). We do not expect 
improvement in delayed recall; at best, we anticipate a preservation of delayed recall. 
Data from a randomized trial showed that the decline i n HVLT -R delayed recall score 
was 64% at 4 months for those getting whole brain radiation for brain metastases  (Chang 
et al., 2009) . We anticipate that WBRT -HA/SIB will have better delayed recall 
functioning at 3 months than WBRT alone. Detecting a 30% ave rage relative loss due to 
WBRT -HA/SIB suggests a 50% relative improvement over previous results. The null and 
alterative hypotheses are:  
 
H0: ΔHVLT -R = 0.60 vs. H A: ΔHVLT -R ≤  0.30  
Page | 22  
   
ΔHVLT -R is the mean of relative decline between baseline and 3 month af ter treatment 
in this patient population. For patient individual i, the relative decline is calculated as 
follows: ΔHVLT -Ri =( HVLT -Ri0 – HVLT -Ri3 ) / HVLT -Ri0 , where HVLT -R i0 and 
HVLT -R i3  denote individual patient score s at baseline and 3 month s after treatment, 
respectively .  
 
                          Initial sample size calculation:  
Based on the one -sided one sample t -test, assuming a standard deviation of 41%, 
with alpha=0.05 (one -sided), a total of 9 analyzable patients would ensure 80% 
statistica l power to dete ct a 30 % average relative loss in delayed recall at 3 
months. Assuming a death rate of 6 0% prior to 3 months and a 10% in -evaluable 
rate, the target sample size will be 34 registered patients.  
 
Sample size re -estimatio n based on internal pil ot study:  
The internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_526630] [ADDRESS_683388] error  of relative (percent) change  (decline)  in HVLT -R 
delayed recall score  is 31% and 51%.  We re -estimate the required sample size 
using the updated standard error.  
 
Based on the one -sided one sample t -test, as suming a standard deviation of 51%, 
with alpha=0.05 (one -sided), a total of 18 analyzable patients would ensure 80% 
statistical power to detect a 30 % average relative loss in delayed recall at 3 
months.  Assuming a death rate of 6 0% prior to 3 months and  a 10% in -evaluable 
rate, the target sample size will be [ADDRESS_683389] with a significance level of 0.05.  
 
 
 
13.3.2 Secondary Endp oints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cognitive Function and Fatigue  
All the secondary cognitive and fatigue endpoints will by [CONTACT_526653].  Additionally, the relationship between the change from baseline 
through 12 months in cognitive and fatigue en dpoints will be evaluated using 
Spearman correlation coefficients.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MFI 
Change in MFI domain scores from baseline to each post -baseline assessment point 
will be analyzed using mixed models for repeated measures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Radiographic Progression   
The Kaplan -Meier estimator will be used to determine the median time to 
radiographic progression for this patient population (along with 95% confidence 
intervals). The Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used to evaluate 
the effects of covaria tes of interest on time to radiographic progression.  
 Overall Survival    
Page | 23  
 The Kaplan -Meier estimator will be used to determine the median time to death for 
this patient population (along with 95% confidence intervals). The Cox proportional 
hazards model will  be used to evaluate the effects of covariates of interest on 
survival.   
[IP_ADDRESS]           Adverse Events    
 Adverse events will be reported according the CTCAE criteria.  
 
13.0 DATA SAFETY MONITORI NG PLAN  
13.1 Purpose and Scope  
13.1.1  The purpose of the Radiation O ncology Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is to ensure that 
clinical trial data is accurate and valid and to ensure the safety of trial participants.   
13.1.2   The Radiation Oncology DSMC is charged with developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], implementing, and 
maintaining the Data and  Safety Monitoring Plan. The membership consists of a Medical 
Director of Clinical Research as well as representation from the following groups:  
clinical research, nursing, regulatory, pharmacy, physicists, radiation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and 
faculty. Ad hoc member s are contact[CONTACT_526654]  
13.2 Procedures  
13.2.1  Clinical trials are assessed for safety on a continual basis throughout the life of the trial.  
All SAE ’s and any AEs that are unexpected and possibly/likely related to study 
participation are  reported to UTSW IRB through an electronic research system per 
UTSW IRB guidelines.   
All clinical trials are reviewed on monthly basis for enrollment.  All local SAEs are reviewed by 
[CONTACT_526655]. For inves tigator -initiated trials, 
all SAEs at affiliated institutions are monitored as local SAEs.  The principle investigator and 
study coordinator will present a study treatment summary and SAEs for review.  Source 
documents will be available for the DSMC member s during the review. NCI Common Toxicity 
Criteria Version 4 will be used for grading and attributing adverse events.   
 
If the SAE occurs on a multi -institutional clinical trial coordinated by [CONTACT_526656], the Clinical R esearch Manager or primary coordinator ensures that all 
participating sites are notified of the event and resulting action, within one (1) working day of the 
determination.

Neurocognitive Function Assessments  
Background Information and Test Instructions  
 
There are three immediate recall responses, one delayed recall response, and one delayed recognition 
respon se in the HVLT -R. The response is the number of words the patient can recall out of [ADDRESS_683398], parts  A & B is the time takes to finish each test less than 3 
and 5 minutes, respectively. There are three responses for the COWAT, and each response is the number of 
words starting with a provided letter of the alphabet that the patient can produce in one minu te. 
 
Testing: General Information  
 
1. Testing should be completed in one session. Test instructions must be followed verbatim with 
every patient at every assessment visit.  
2. Tests should be administered in the following order to every patient and at each assess ment visit: 
HVLTR Part A (Learning Trials); Trail Making Test Part A; Trail Making Test Part B; COWAT; 
HVLT -R Part B (Delayed Recall); and the HVLT -R Part C (Delayed Recognition).  
3. Follow the instructions on the Forms Packet Index before submitting the form s. 
4. All test results are recorded on the Neurocognitive Evaluation Summary Form (CS), which is 
found in the Forms Packet. Study/case -specific labels must be applied to all forms.  
5. Note : Sites should keep all original test records, and test results must remai n on file at the 
institution as source documentation pending request for submission by a Study Chair.  
6. Patients should not be given copi[INVESTIGATOR_217380].  
7. The HVLT -R and the COWAT have alternate f orms or versions in order to reduce the effects of 
practice. See the test instructions below for the versions to be administered at pre -treatment and 
subsequent sessions. The forms should continue to be alternated in this order for the duration of 
the stud y. The forms packet will contain alternate versions of these neuropsychological tests.  
 
Before dismissing the patient, thank him/her for their cooperation. Remind the patient of their next 
appointment and that these tests will be repeated.  
 
In the event th at a patient cannot complete a given test, please write the reason(s) on the test form AND the 
data summary form.  
 
Testing: Specific Instructions  
Note: Administer the tests in the following order to every patient at each assessment visit.  
 
1. HOPKINS VERBA L LEARNING TEST - REVISED (HVLT -R) 
 
This test has three parts and six alternate forms (only the first 4 forms will be used in this study):  
Part A - Free Recall: Complete the three learning trials first  
Part B - Delayed Recall: Complete after Trail Making T ests and COWAT  
Part C - Delayed Recognition: Complete after Delayed Recall  
 
Part A – Free Recall: Trial 1  
Examiner : “I am going to read a list of words to you. Listen carefully, because when I am through, I ’d 
like you to tell me as many of the words as you  can remember. You can tell them to me in any order. Are 
you ready?”  
• Read the words at the rate of one word every 2 seconds.  
 
Examiner: “OK. Now tell me as many of those words as you can remember .” 
 
 
 
 
 • Check off the words the patient recalls on the form.  
• If a word is said that is not in the list ( for example, “intrusion” ), do not write that word on the form and 
say nothing to the patient about the word not being on the list.  
• If the patient does not produce any words for 10 -15 seconds, ask the patient if  he/she can remember any 
more words.  
• If not, move on to trial 2. Later, you can record the number of words that were correctly repeated on the 
summary form.  
 
Part A – Free Recall: Trial 2  
Examiner : “Now we are going to try it again. I am going to read th e same list of words to you. Listen 
carefully, and tell me as many of the words as you can remember, in any order, including the words you 
told me the first time.”  
• Read the words at the rate of one word every 2 seconds.  
• Check off the words the patient recalls on the form.  
If a word is said that is not in the list ( for example, “intrusion” ), do not write that word on the form and say 
nothing to the patient about the word not being on the list.  
• If the patient does not produce any words for 10 -15 seconds , ask the patient if he/she can remember any 
more words.  
• If not, move on to trial 3. Later, you can record the number of words that were correctly repeated on the 
summary form.  
 
Part A – Free Recall: Trial 3  
Examiner : “I am going to read the list one mor e time. As before, I ’d like you to tell me as many of the 
words as you can remember, in any order, including all the words you ’ve already told me.”  
• Read the words at the rate of one word every 2 seconds.  
• Check off the words the patient recalls on the f orm.  
• If a word is said that is not in the list ( for example, “intrusion” ), do not write that word on the form and 
say nothing to the patient about the word not being on the list.  
• If the patient does not produce any words for 10 -15 seconds, ask the pati ent if he/she can remember any 
more words.  
• Do not tell the respondent that recall of the words will be tested later.  
• Record the time on the clock that you complete ‘Part A – Free Recall ’ (for example, 1:00 p.m.) on the 
designated space on the HVLT -R form. 
 
2. TRAIL MAKING TEST [Timed Test]  
 
Part A – Sample : Place the Sample A worksheet flat on the table, directly in front of the patient (the 
bottom of the worksheet should be approximately six inches from the edge of the table). Give the patient a 
black pen and say:  
Examiner : “On this page (point) are some numbers. Begin at number 1 (point to 1) and draw a line 
from 1 to 2 (point to 2), 2 to 3 (point to 3) , 3 to 4 (point to 4), and so on, in order, until you reach the 
end (point to the circle marked END).  Draw the lines as fast as you can. Ready, begin.”  
 
If the patient completes Sample A correctly, and in a manner demonstrating that s/he understands what to 
do, proceed immediately to Test A. If the patient makes a mistake on Sample A, point out the error and 
explain it.  
The following explanations of mistakes serve as illustrations:  
• This is where you start (point to number 1).  
• You skipped this circle (point to the circle omitted).  
• You should go from number [ADDRESS_683399] but missed it, do not count it as an omission. Remind 
the patient, however, to be sure to touch the circles. If the patient still cannot complete Sample A, take 
 
 
 
 
 his/her hand a nd guide him/her through the trail using the opposite end of the pen, lightly touching the 
worksheet to avoid making marks on he copy. Then say:  
Examiner : “Remember, begin at number 1 ( point to 1 ) and draw a line from 1 to 2 ( point to 2 ), 2 to 3 
(point to 3), 3 to 4 ( point to 4 ) and so on, in order, until you reach the circle marked END ( point ). Do 
not skip around, but go from one number to the next in proper order. Remember to work as fast as you 
can. Ready, begin.”  
 
If the patient does not succeed, or it becomes evident that s/he cannot do the task, DISCONTINUE testing 
and indicate the corresponding reason on the Trail Making Data Sheet. If the patient completes Sample A 
correctly and appears to understand what to do, proceed immediately to Part A.  
 
Part A  – Test:  After the patient has completed Sample A, place the Part A test worksheet directly in front 
of the patient and say:  
Examiner : “Good! Let ’s try the next one. On this page are numbers from [ADDRESS_683400]. 
Begin at number 1 ( point ) and  draw a line from 1 to 2 ( point to 2 ), 2 to 3 ( point to 3 ), 3 to 4 ( point to 4 ) 
and so on, in order, until you reach the circle marked END ( point ). Do not skip around, but go from one 
number to the next in proper order. Remember to work as fast as you can.  Ready, begin.”  
• Start timing as soon as the instruction is given to “begin”  
• Watch closely in order to catch any errors as soon as they are made. If the patient makes an error, call it to 
his/her attention immediately and have him/her proceed from the p oint the mistake occurred  
• The patient must complete the test in 3 minutes or less.  
• DO NOT STOP TIMING UNTIL HE/SHE REACHES THE CIRCLE MARKED “END”.  
• Collect the worksheet and record the time to completion on the Trail Making Data Sheet in minutes and 
seconds  
• If the patient does not complete the test within [ADDRESS_683401].  
 
Part B – Sample:  Place the Sample B worksheet flat on the table, directly in front of the patient (the 
bottom of the worksheet should be approximately six inches from the edge of the table) and say:  
Examiner : “On this page ( point ) are some numbers and letters. Begin at number 1 ( point to 1 ) and 
draw a line from 1 to A ( point ), A to 2 ( point to 2 ), 2 to B ( point to B ), B to 3 ( point to 3 ), 3 to C ( point 
to C) and so on, in order, until you reach the end ( point to the circle marked END ). Remember, first 
you have a number ( point to 1 ), then a letter ( point to A ), then a number ( point to 2 ), then a letter (point 
to B), and so on. Draw the lines as fast as you can . Ready, begin.”  
 
If the patient completes Sample B correctly, and in a manner demonstrating that s/he understands what to 
do, proceed immediately to Part B. If the patient makes a mistake on Sample B, point out the error and 
explain it.  
The following expl anations of mistakes serve as illustrations:  
• You started with the wrong circle. This is where you start (point to number 1)  
• You skipped this circle (point to the circle omitted)  
• You should go from number 1 ( point ) to A ( point ), A to 2 ( point to 2 ), 2 to B ( point to B ), B to 3 ( point 
to 3) and so on, until you reach the circle marked END ( point ). 
 
If it is clear the patient intended to touch a circle but missed it, do not count it as an omission. Remind the 
patient, however, to be sure to touch the cir cles. If the patient still cannot complete Sample B, take their 
hand and guide them through the trail using the opposite end of the pen, lightly touching the worksheet to 
avoid making marks on the copy. Then say:  
Examiner : “Now you try it. Remember, begin at number 1 ( point to 1 ) and draw a line from 1 to A 
(point to A ), A to 2 ( point to 2 ), 2 to B ( point to B ), B to 3 ( point to 3 ) and so on, in order, until you 
reach the circle marked END ( point ). Ready, begin.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 If the patient does not succeed or it becom es evident that s/he cannot do the task, DISCONTINUE testing 
and indicate the corresponding reason on the Trail Making Data Sheet. If the patient completes Sample A 
correctly and appears to understand what to do, proceed immediately to Part A.  
 
Part B – Test: 
After the patient has completed Sample B, place the Part B Worksheet directly in front of the patient and 
say: 
Examiner : “Good! Let ’s try the next one. On this page are both numbers and letters. Do this the same  
way. Begin at number 1 ( point ) and draw a line from 1 to A ( point to A ), A to 2 ( point to 2 ), 2 to B 
(point to B ), B to 3 ( point to 3 ), 3 to C ( point to C ) and so on, in order, until you reach the circle marked 
END ( point ). Remember, first you have a number ( point to 1 ), then a letter ( point to A), then a number 
(point to 2 ), then a letter ( point to B ), and so on. Do not skip around, but go from one circle to the next 
in the proper order. Draw the lines as fast as you can. Ready, begin.”  
• Start timing as soon as the instruction is given to “begi n”. 
• Watch closely in order to catch any errors as soon as they are made. If the patient makes an error, call it  
to his/her attention immediately and have him/her proceed from the point the mistake occurred  
• The patient must complete the test in 5 minute s or less.  
• DO NOT STOP TIMING UNTIL HE/SHE REACHES THE CIRCLE MARKED “END”.  
• Collect the worksheet and record the time to completion on the Trail Making Data Sheet in minutes and 
seconds.  
• If the patient does not complete the test within [ADDRESS_683402] (COWAT) [Timed Test]  
 
This test has three parts (letters) and two alternate forms.  
 
Examiner : “I am going to say a letter of the alphabet, and I want you to say as quickly as yo u can all of 
the words that you can think of that begin with that letter. You may say any words at all, except proper 
names such as the names of people or places. So you would not say ‘[COMPANY_002]ster ’ or ‘Robert ’. Also, do not 
use the same word again with a dif ferent ending, such as ‘Eat,’ ‘Eats, ’ and ‘Eating. ’ 
 
“For example, if I say ‘s,’ you could say ‘sit,’ ‘shoe, ’ or ‘show. ’ Can you think of other words beginning 
with the letter ‘s’?” 
 
Wait for the patient to give a word. If it is a correct response, say “good”, and ask for another word 
beginning with the letter “s”. If a second appropriate word is given, proceed to the test itself.  
 
If the patient gives an inappropriate word on either occasion, correct the patient, and repeat the instructions. 
If the patient  then succeeds, proceed to the test.  
 
If the patient fails to respond, repeat the instructions. If it becomes clear that the patient does not 
understand the instructions or cannot associate, stop the procedure, and indicate the reason(s) on the scoring 
sheet. 
 
If the patient has succeeded in giving two appropriate words beginning with the demonstration letter, say:  
 
Examiner : “That is fine. Now I am going to give you another letter. Again, say all of the words 
beginning with that letter that you can think o f. Remember, no names of people or places, just ordinary 
words. Also, if you should draw a blank, I want you to keep on trying until the time limit is up and I say 
STOP.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 “You will have a minute for each letter. The first letter is ‘___’” (see scoring she et). 
 
**Allow exactly one minute for each letter.**  
• If the patient discontinues before the end of the time period, encourage him/her to try to think of more 
words.  
• If he/she is silent for 15 seconds, repeat the basic instruction and the letter (e.g., “Tell me all the words 
you can think of that begin with a “c” ). 
• No extension on the time limit is made in the event that instructions are repeated.  
• Continue the evaluation with the remaining two letters, allowing one minute for each.  
 
Recording and Scor ing: 
• The record sheet provides lines on which the patient ’s responses can be entered (e.g., write in the word 
that is said by [CONTACT_102]) . If his/her speed of word production is too fast to permit verbatim recording, a  
“+” should be entered to indicate a correct response.  
• Incorrect responses either should not be recorded or, if recorded, should be struck through with a line.  
• If the patient provides more responses than there are lines on the record sheet, keep writing the responses 
(or a “+”) elsewher e on the record sheet.  
• Count all the correct responses. The number of correct words should be indicated below each column  
on the recording sheet and on the summary data form.  
 
Comments on scoring:  
• Note: It can be helpful for the first several patients and for patients known to be fast with their word 
production to tape record the session for transcription at a later time.  
• The instructions include a specific prohibition against giving proper names or different forms of the same 
word. Therefore, inflect ions of the same word (e.g., eat -eating; mouse -mice; loose -loosely; ran -run-runs) 
are not considered correct responses.  
• Patients often give both a verb and a word derived from the verb or adjective (e.g., fun -funny; 
sadsadness) . These are not considered correct responses. On the other hand, if the word refers to a specific 
object (e.g., foot -footstool; hang -hanger), it would be counted as a correct answer.  
• Many words have two or more meanings (e.g., foot; can; catch; hand) . A repetition of the word is 
acceptable IF the patient definitely indicates the alternative meaning to you.  
• Slang terms are OK if they are in general use.  
• Foreign words (for example, pasta; passé; lasagna) can be counted as correct if they can be considered 
part of English vocabula ry (for example, in general use or found in the dictionary).  
• If the test is discontinued or omitted, please mark this on the bottom of the test form and indicate the 
reason on the Tests Discontinued/Not Done CRF  
 
4. HOPKINS VERBAL LEARNING TEST - REVISED  (HVLT -R) 
 
Part B – Delayed Recall  
• DO NOT READ THE WORD LIST AGAIN.  
• Record the time on the clock that you start ‘Part B – Delayed Recall ’ (for example, 1:20 p.m.) on the 
designated space on the HVLT -R form.  
• Administer ‘Part B – Delayed Recall ’ after completing all Trail Making Tests and the COWAT. There 
should be at least 15 minutes between ‘Part A ’ and ‘Part B ’. If the time is too short, allow the patients to 
complete a questionnaire.  
 
Examiner: “ Do you remember that list of words you tried to learn before? Tell me as many of those 
words as you can remember.”  
• Check the box on the corresponding line of the HVLT -R worksheet for each word the patient accurately 
recalls.  
• If a word is said that is not in the list ( for example, “intrusion” ), do not writ e that word on the form and 
say nothing to the patient about the word not being on the list.  
 
 
 
 
 • If the patient does not produce any words for 10 -15 seconds, ask the patient if he/she can remember any 
more words.  
• If not, record the number of words that wer e correctly recalled on the summary form.  
 
Part C – Delayed Recognition  
Examiner : “Now I ’m going to read a longer list of words to you. Some of them are words from the 
original list, and some are not. After I read each word, I ’d like you to say “Yes” if it  was on the original 
list or “No” if it was not. Was [word] on the list?”  
• Check either the “ Y” (Yes) or “ N” (No) box next to each word to indicate the patient ’s response.  
• Guessing is allowed.  
• If the test is discontinued or omitted, please mark this o n the bottom of the test form and indicate the 
reason on the Tests Discontinued/Not Done CRF.  
The score for this portion of the HVLT -R is the number of list words (i.e., words that in CAPS) correctly 
identified (“yes” response) minus the number of non -list words (i.e., words in lower case) incorrectly 
identified (“yes” response). Therefore, the actual score can range from –12 (no list words identified and all 
non-list words identified) to +12 (all list words identified and no non -list words identified) .

Study Description: This is a randomized, double-bli nd, placebo-controlled, multi-c enter study 
of two doses of daxibotulinumtoxinA (DAXI) for injection in adult subjects 
with unilateral plantar fasciitis (PF). 
Approximately 150 subjects recru ited from approximately 20 inve stigator 
sites in the US will be randomized  
 
 
 
PIs, site staff (excluding unbli nded dose preparers), subjects,  and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in th e Numeric 
Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score at Week 8.  In case of no improvement, defined as no change or worsening of  the NPRS 
score from baseline, Week [ADDRESS_298765] (i.e., the “early study completer”). Subjects who exper ience any 
treatment benefit (any decrease fro m baseline on NPRS score) wi ll continue 
in the study. NPRS scores will be collected by [CONTACT_245730] i n an ePRO 
diary. Algometry, Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), and 
Patient-reported Outcomes (PROs;  i.e., Foot Function Index [FFI ], Foot and 
Ankle Ability Measure [FAAM], Patient Global Impression of Chan ge 
[PGIC] and Treatment Satisfacti on Questionnaire [TSQ]) will be performed 
at prespecified time points durin g the study, as efficacy evalu ations.  Safety 
will be assessed based on adverse events (AEs), clinical labora tory 
parameters, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs),  
 physical examination, a nd the Columbia – Suicide Sever ity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS).

8.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled , multicenter study of two doses of DAXI 
for injection in adult subjects with unilateral PF. 
Approximately 150 subjects, recru ited from approximately 20 investigator sites in the US will be 
randomized  
 
Imaging  (e.g., x-ray or sonography) of the foot will be used to rule out concomitant disease conditions.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in NP RS score (average over 5 days, defined 
as 4 days prior to study visit and on study visit day) at Week 8.  Daily NPRS scores will be recorded in an 
ePRO diary within the first [ADDRESS_298773] (i.e., the 
“early study completer”). Subjects who experience any treatment  benefit, defined as any decrease in 
NPRS score from baseline, will c ontinue to be observed up until  Week 24 (see Section 8.7 for additional 
detail). The NPRS score will be recorded daily in an ePRO diary  by [CONTACT_423], as the primary efficacy 
evaluation. At site visits, algom etry (to determine PPT), FFI, FAAM, CGIC, PGIC, and TSQ will be 
performed at prespecified time points during the study.   
Safety assessments are AE monitoring , clinical 
laboratory tests (hematology, prothrombin time, chemistry, and urinalysis), pregnancy tests for WOCBP, 
, physical examinations, vital signs, [ADDRESS_298774] is approximately 7 months ( up to 14 days for screening, 7 days [+3] 
for run-in, and up to 24 weeks for follow-up after the Day 1 tr eatment visit).

Revance Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential 40 8.7 END OF STUDY DEFINITION 
Study completion may occur at W eek 8 (“early study completers” who have no treatment benefit based on 
NPRS) or at Week 24 (“study completers”): 
Week 8 Early Study Completers: 
 No Treatment Benefit:  
o Subjects who do not demonstrate improvement at Week 8, where im provement is defined as 
any decrease from baseline on NPRS score  
o A subject may also complete the  study at Week 8 based on the in vestigator’s clinical 
judgment of no clinical improvement following treatment, regard less of whether the subject 
showed a treatment benefit based on the NPRS score evaluation described above.   
Week 24 Study Completers: 
 Treatment Benefit: Subjects who demonstrate improvement at Week  8, defined as any decrease 
from baseline on NPRS score, should continue in the study for f ollow-up until Week 24 and will 
be considered “complete” following the conclusion of their Week  24 visit. 
For subjects who choose to discontinue from the study prior to these timepoints for any reason, every 
effort should be made to complete the Week 24/ET visit.  
[ADDRESS_298775] meet the following inclusion criteria at scre en or if indicated at screening and baseline:  
1. Able to understand the nature of the study and protocol require ments and provide written 
informed consent and including authorization to release health information. 
2. Male or female subjects 18 to 65 years of age inclusive with diagnosis of unilateral PF.  
3. Upon physical exam, unilateral presence of pain upon palpation over medial calcaneal tuberosity. 
4. Persistent heel pain at the insertion of the plantar fascia in the posterior-inferior medial calcaneal 
tuberosity for 3 months or more , but not to exceed 15 months

however, they may be considered f or one-time re-screening in co nsultation with the sponsor/CRO. 
9.5 RE-SCREENINGS 
Screen failed (those that do not meet all eligibility requireme nts per protocol) may be considered for one-
time re-screening in consultation with the sponsor/CRO. For re- screening, subjects will be assigned a new 
subject number in the study and must fulfill all eligibility requirements per protocol. 
Subjects that underwent imaging of their foot during their init ial screening visit will not be required to 
repeat this assessment.  
Subjects that screen fail for a second time will not be permitt ed to re-screen further.

10.6 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
Concomitant medications are any  prescription or over-the-counter preparations used by [CONTACT_245731].  Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the Concomitant 
Medications CRF beginning at Screening through Week 24/ET.  The  dose and dosing regimen of all 
prescription and non-prescription therapi[INVESTIGATOR_19080], in cluding herbs, vitamins, or other 
nutritional supplements adminis tered will be documented. 
Use of prohibited medications/tr eatments as described in Section 9.3.1 will be considered as a protocol 
deviation.   
10.6.1  RESCUE MEDICINE 
At the Week 8 visit, the following 2 categories of subjects will be identified to the sites: 
 subjects having no improvement from baseline on NPRS scores (se e Section 8.7)  
 subjects having improvement from baseline of <20% based on NPRS  scores  
Prior to Week 8, the protocol do es not allow for any type of re scue medication for the treatment of PF.  At 
Week 8, for subjects with <20% reduction from baseline in their  NPRS score at Week 8, physician-
prescribed physical therapy will be permitted upon subject request.   
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time if medication is required to address the subject’s 
symptoms associated with PF (in addition to other reasons a sub ject may have for early discontinuation).

A subject may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time.  If the subject withdraws 
consent and discontinues from the trial, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245684]’s study records and on the  CRF.  If a subject withdraws consent 
because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for  withdrawal.  In the event of early 
discontinuation, (i.e., prior to Week 24) and whenever possible , the subject should be asked to return to 
the investigator site to comple te the assessments specified for  Week 24/ET.  Subjects who withdraw from 
the study will not be replaced. Early study completers, as defi ned in Section 8.7 will also complete the 
Week 24/ET CRF, at the time of study exit (ie, Week 8 visit). 
If at any time during the trial, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245685] n ot in the best interest of the subject to continue, 
the subject will be discontinued from participation.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_19529] n discontinue a subject from study 
participation at any time if m edically necessary or if the subj ect has failed to follow study procedures or 
to keep follow-up appointments .  Appropriate documentation in t he subject’s study record and CRF 
regarding the reason for discontinuation must be completed. Pri or to discontinuing a subject from study

12.2 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
The timing of all efficacy assessm ents is as described in the S chedule of Assessments in Section 5.3. 
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): ( Ferreira-Valente, 2011; McCaffery, 1989; Jensen, 2015; 
Dworkin, 2005 )  The NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog sc ale (VAS) in which a 
respondent selects a whole number (0–10 integers) that best ref lects the intensity of his/her pain.  The 
common format is a horizontal bar or line.  Similar to the VAS,  the NPRS is anchored by [CONTACT_245738].   See APPENDIX B  
FFI (Foot Function Index):  The FFI ( Budiman-Mak, 1991 ) was developed to measure the impact  of foot 
pathology on function in terms  of pain, disability and activity  restriction and is a self-administered index 
consisting of [ADDRESS_298783] of PF on foot function.  Foot func tion and pain levels directly can be 
correlated with treatment outcomes in the Revance Phase 2 study .  See APPENDIX C  
FAAM (Foot and Ankle Ability Measure):  The FAAM was developed to comprehensively assess 
physical performance among individuals with leg, and ankle musc uloskeletal disorders ( Martin, 2005 ).  
The FAAM can be applied to pe rformance as relates to PF.  See APPENDIX D  
CGIC (Clinical Global Impression of Change) : The CGIC is a questionna ire that captures the 
clinician’s overall impression of the subject’s response to stu dy treatment.  The clinician’s selected 
response maps to a 7-point scale: -3 (very much worse), 0 (abou t the same), to +3 (very much better). 
(Guy, 1976).  See APPENDIX E .   
PGIC (Patient Global Impression of Change) :  The PGIC is a questionnaire that captures the subject’s 
overall impression of their response to study treatment.  The s ubject’s selected response maps to a 7-point 
scale: -3 (very much worse), 0 (about the same), to +3 (very mu ch better). (Farrar, 2001 ).  See 
APPENDIX F. 
TSQ (Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire):  The TSQ is self-administered instrument that measures 
the subject’s overall satisfacti on with his or her study treatm ent (Revicki, 2004 ).  See  APPENDIX G . 
Algometry:  Pressure algometers are designe d to measure deep pressure pain  thresholds or tenderness 
resistance.  When a particular site of the body is pressed with  a rubber disk having an area of 1 cm2, the 
device displays the pressure ( Park, 2011 ).  PPT will be measured by [CONTACT_245739]-treatment 
on Day 1 and at each subsequent c linic visit at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24/ET.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_245690] t enderness and mark the spot, pos ition the digital pressure algometer and 
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for Plantar Fasciitis               Version [ADDRESS_298784] until the subjects reports pain (note; this is th e minimal amount of pain, not pressure).  The 
pressure pain threshold is measured [ADDRESS_298785] reported recorded in kg/cm2 for each test.   
12.3 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
The timing of all safety assessments is as described in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 5.3. 
12.3.1  ADVERSE EVENTS  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ASSESSMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
AEs will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe as defined in S ection [IP_ADDRESS].3 of this protocol. 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].5 outlines the procedures for recording and re porting AEs. 
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_245740] “21CRF part 312.32 and Guidance for Industry 
and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements.”  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_245691]. 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  A
DVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) 
For this protocol, an AE is an y untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, disease, syndrome, 
intercurrent illness, clinically significant abnormal laborator y finding, injury or accident) that emerges or 
worsens following administration of IP and until the end of stu dy participation that may not necessarily 
have a causal relationship to the  administration of the IP.  An  AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or 
unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal la boratory result), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not con sidered related to the IP.  A treatment-
emergent AE is one that occurs a fter any period of exposure to treatment. 
Pre-existing conditions, which increase in frequency or severit y or a change in nature as a consequence of 
an IP use will also be considered an AE. 

DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for Plantar Fasciitis               Version [ADDRESS_298786] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure f or an unapproved IP or package 
insert/summary of product charact eristics for an approved produ ct). 
Any clinically significant cha nge in the study safety evaluatio ns, (e.g., vital signs, laboratory results, 
ECG, injection site evaluation, physical/neurological examinati ons, etc.) post-treatme nt must be reported 
as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in any o f the following outcomes: 
 Death  
 Life-threatening, (i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_245692]/or sponsor/CRO, at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe)  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to 
carry out normal life functions  
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245693]  (i.e., a prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245694] y; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245695]/surgical procedures, 
scheduled treatments, or routine check-ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_245741])  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect  (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject exposed 
to the molecule or IP before conception or during pregnancy)  
 Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but based upon appropriate medical judgement 
may jeopardize the subject or ma y require medical or surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., is a significant or important medi cal event) 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT 
Severity of Event  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_245696] e severity of the event.  Severity will be 
categorized as mild, moderate o r severe according to the follow ing definitions: 
 Mild:  Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily a ctivities; usually does not 
require intervention 
 Moderate:  Event may be of sufficient severity to make subject uncomforta ble; performance of 
daily activities may be influenced ; intervention may be needed 
 Severe:  Event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with dai ly activities; subject may 
not be able to continue in the trial; treatment or other interv ention usually needed

Revance Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential 58 Relationship to Study Intervention 
Relationship of an AE to IP w ill be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_245697]: 
 Definite:  There is a clinically plausible  time sequence between the onse t of the AE and the 
administration of IP; when the event responds to withdrawal of IP and/or recurs with re-
administration of IP 
 Probable:  There is a clinically plausible  time sequence between the onse t of the AE and the 
administration of IP; the AE is  unlikely to be caused by [CONTACT_245742]/underlying illness, 
other drugs or procedures 
 Possible:  There may or may not be a clini cally plausible time sequence b etween the onset of 
the AE and the administration of  IP and a cause cannot be ruled  out 
 Unrelated:  There is not a temporal or causal relationship to IP administr ation  
Expectedness  
The medical monitor and sponsor /CRO will be responsible for det ermining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected.  An AE will be consider ed unexpected if the nature,  severity, or frequency o f the event is not 
consistent with the risk inform ation previously described for t he study intervention.  Expectedness is 
further defined in the Investig ator’s Brochure (IB) under Antic ipated Risks and Side Effects. The list of 
AEs found in the IB can be considered to be expected AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_298787] pr esenting for medical care, or upo n review by [CONTACT_245743]. 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate CRF.  Information to be collected includes event de scription, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relations hip to study product (assessed  only by [CONTACT_12213] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabiliz ation of the event.  All AEs occurring while 
on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relatio nship.  All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subj ect is screened will be considered as medical 
history and not reported as an AE.  However, if the subject’s c ondition deteriorates at any time following 
injection at their Day [ADDRESS_298788] all reportable ev ents with start dates occurring any time after

order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following non-leading question: “How 
have you felt since your last visit?” All AEs (serious and non- serious) reported by [CONTACT_245744].  
In addition, PIs and/or investigat or site staff must report an SAE to the sponsor/CRO within 24 hours  of 
their awareness of the event according to the procedure outline d below. All fatal or life-threatening SAEs 
should be telephoned to the sponsor/CRO or the authorized repre sentative as soon as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_55772]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245699] s to the sponsor/CRO authorized 
representative within 24 hours  of their awareness of the event: 
 Complete and return an SAE Form  with all information known to d ate; including the PI’s 
assessment of causality.  
 If the event is fatal or life-threatening, telephone sponsor/CR O or the authorized representative as 
soon as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_54813].  
 Obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records (discharge su mmary, autopsy report, etc.) and 
medical judgments of investigator site staff who assisted in su bject’s treatment and follow-up.  
 Provide follow-up information to the sponsor/CRO or the authori zed representative. 
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or unti l the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245700].  Other supportin g documentation of the event  may be requested by [CONTACT_245745]/sponsor/CRO  and should be provided as soon as possible. 
The sponsor will be responsible for notifying the FDA of any un expected fatal or life-threatening 
suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the 
sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  In addition, the  sponsor must notify FDA, and all 
participating investigator sit es in an IND safety report, of po tential serious risks from clinical studies (or 
any other source) as soon as possi ble, but in no case later tha n 15 calendar days after the sponsor 
determines that the information qualifies for reporting. 
Regulatory authorities, IRBs/IEC, and investigator sites will b e notified of SAEs in accordance with 
applicable regulations and requi rements (e.g., GCPs, ICH Guidel ines, national regulations and local 
requirements). 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_245701]’s health has returned to baseline, the SAE has 
stabilized, or remaining health  issues have otherwise been expl ained.

Follow-up of Non-Serious Adverse Events 
Non-serious AEs that are identified during the last scheduled s tudy visit (or early discontinuation, if 
applicable) must be record ed on the AE CRF as ongoing. 
Any clinically significant abnormal test results, e.g., laborat ory findings, at the Week 24/ET visit should 
be followed to resolution or un til determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_245702].  Repeat tests may be indicated to 
establish this. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, trial-related abnormalities at the end of the trial, the medical 
monitor should be notified, and every effort made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_245703]. 
Follow-up of Post Study Serious Adverse Events 
SAEs that are identified on the last scheduled contact (or earl y discontinuation, if applicable) must be 
recorded on the AE CRF page and reported to the sponsor/CRO acc ording to the reporting procedures 
outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].6.   This may include unresolved previously reported SAEs, or new SAEs.

 Warmth at the injection site  
An additional blood draw should be  performed in order to addres s immediate hypersensitivity concerns.  
Revance recommends that at least 2 of the 4 above-listed sympto ms should be present to make this 
clinical diagnosis.  The investigat or should also use his/her c linical judgment in addition to the 
aforementioned guidelines.  
12.3.6  PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS 
Physical examination will include neurological examination; the  PE will include examination of the face, 
general appearance, skin, neck ( including thyroid), eyes, ears,  nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, lymph 
nodes, and extremities. Urogenital exam need only be completed if clinically indicated.  At post-treatment 
visits, the physical examination may be abbreviated, as deemed medically appropriate at the discretion of 
the PI; the neurological examination must be conducted at a min imum.  Significant physical examination 
findings that are present prior to IP administration are to be included on the Medical History page. 
Significant physical examination findings which meet the defini tion of an AE will be recorded on the AE 
page post-treatment .  
12.3.7  FOOT AND ANKLE EXAMINATION 
Examination for the foot will be  conducted, including ankle, to e, and subtalar range of motion, foot motor 
strength, location of pain, and examination of the heel fat pad  and Tinel’s sign.  The presence of toe 
deformities, bunions, ulcers, and/ or sores will be documented.  The feet will be examined for signs of 
swelling, pi[INVESTIGATOR_13034], infection, or vascular abnormalities ( refer to APPENDIX A). 
12.3.8  HEIGHT, WEIGHT, VITAL SIGNS 
Height, weight, and vital signs ( i.e., body temperature, respir ation rate, sitting radial pulse rate, and sitting 
systolic and diastolic BP) will be obtained.  Height will only be collected at the Screening visit.    
12.3.9  COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE 
The C-SSRS monitors changes in sui cidal thinking and behavior o ver time, in order to determine risk 
(Posner, 2011 ; APPENDIX H ).  The following four constructs  are measured: the severity of  ideation, the 
intensity of ideation, b ehavior, and lethality.  
The C-SSRS will be used to assess suicidal ideations and behavi ors.  The C-SSRS results for each subject 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_245709].  If at any time the  C-SSRS results for a given subject reveal

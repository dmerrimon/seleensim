 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Tilmanocept (technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept) Injection was approved by [CONTACT_36432] ([LOCATION_002]) Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_862689] a primary tumor site in patients with solid tumors for which this procedure is a 
component of intraoperative management and for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with clinically node negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity, breast cancer, 
or melanoma. 
Tilmanocept Injection  is approved in the European Union (EU) for use in imaging and intraoperative 
detection of sentinel lymph nodes draining a primary tumor in adult patients with breast cancer, 
melanoma, or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity  (SEE: www.Lymphoseek.com). 
Tilmanocept is a radiotracer that accumulates in lymphatic tissue by [CONTACT_4639] a mannose binding receptor that resides on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages within the first draining lymph 
nodes. Tilmanocept is a macromolecule consisting of mu ltiple units of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic 
acid acid (DTPA) and mannose, each synthetically attached to a 10 kilodalton dextran backbone. The 
mannose acts as a substrate for the receptor, and the DTPA serves as a chelating agent for labeling with Tc-99m . Tilmanocept's small diameter permits rapid transit from the injection site ( subcutaneous [ SC] 
or intradermal  [ID]) to the lymphatic channels and blood capi[INVESTIGATOR_862690].  
The pathogenesis of cancer is a complex multistep process involving the acquisition of genetic 
abnormalities by [CONTACT_862719]. The inflammation is generally driven by [CONTACT_20150] -associated macrophages ( TAMs), and these cells have 
been proven in a variety of systems to provide a supportive environment for tumor progression. In 
addition, there is increasing evidence that tumor metastasis is associated with tumor cells that co -
express macrophage markers that allow more efficient metastasis. As metastasis is critical to the overall pathogenesis of cancer and survival in patients with cancer, both TAMs and tumor cells bearing 
macrophage markers would be important targets for quantitative imaging in the development of anti -
cancer therapeuti cs. In this context, AIDS(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) -associated Kaposi 
sarcoma (KS) is a form of cancer in which inflammation plays a critical role in tumor development. Because tilmanocept binds to CD206 (mannose binding receptor), it could have a significant role in the 
development of a new wave of diagnostic and anti- tumor agents directed against TAMs and metastatic 
tumor cells by [CONTACT_862720].  
Macrophages are one of the most versatile cell types in t he body, largely owing to their ability to 
fluctuate between activation states depending on their microenvironment. They function in both innate 
and adaptive immunity through the phagocytosis of foreign materials and pathogens, as well as by 
[CONTACT_862721] e activation of other immune cells. Macrophages make up a large portion of the 
inflammatory infiltrate for most cancer types, including KS, and may represent up to 80% of the total tumor mass. Monocyte recruitment is essential for tumor development as these cells are present during the early stages of tumor growth and promote progressive tumorigenesis. Blood monocytes are 
recruited from the vasculature into the tumor, in response to chemo -attractants released by [CONTACT_20405], 
where they differentiate into TA Ms. TAMs are a heterogeneous mass of cells consisting of resident 
macrophages, early infiltrating perivascular macrophages, and monocytes/macrophages. Depending on 
the microenvironment, macrophages either become M1 (classically activated, MAC387 -positive) in 
response to pro- inflammatory molecules and pathogens, or become M2 (alternatively activated,

 CD163- positive). In KS, as well as many other cancer types, the primary infiltrating form of 
macrophage is the M2 subset  (1-4).  
AIDS -related KS is an aggressiv e, multifocal, angioproliferative neoplasm associated with Kaposi 
sarcoma herpes virus (HHV8/KSHV) infection. It involves cutaneous and non-cutaneous tissues, with 
later forms of disease associated with widespread organ involvement. It is the most common cancer in 
patients infected with HIV. Effective antiviral therapy has produced a decline in the incidence of AIDS -
related KS, but HIV-infected individuals still have a 3,640-fold greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_862691]. In general, no i maging studies have been able to identify specific KS -involved 
tissues, apart from standard ultrasound and CT  (computed tomography)  imaging, in which therapy-
associated changes are implied to be associated with KS lesion shrinkage (1-4).  
KS lesions are co mprise d of KS spi[INVESTIGATOR_862692]8/KSHV, as well as numerous 
macrophage antigen -expressing cells. Crucially, a large collection of both skin and visceral forms of 
KS were tested to determine whether the CD206 molecule would be present on both K S tumor cells 
and TAMs, allowing the potential for using Tc 99m tilmanocept as a tumor -specific imaging agent 
capable of identifying both tumor cells and TAMs in patients with KS.  
Historically, no imaging platform has been able to identify KS -specific les ions in patients with KS. 
This has caused problems for the delivery of clinical care, as physicians are unable to appropriately 
stage patients with KS, other than by [CONTACT_862722]. KS is known to involve lymph nodes and organs, but to date no approach has been able to confirm tumor involvement beyond skin. Our 
investigations have confirmed that the majority of both TAMs and KS cells express the macrophage marker CD206, the receptor for the tilmanocept imaging agent.  
The observation that  tilmanoce
 pt bind s specific ally to CD206- positive macrophages has been extended 
to CD206- positive tissue from KS patients.  This performance makes tilmanocept an ideal agent for use 
in patients with KS to stage and quantitatively image tumor -specific respo nse to therapy. By [CONTACT_66250], 
other classes of tumors may be similar hybrid- like cells and may be imaged with tilmanocept and 
clinically addressed using macrophage-targeted therapy(5-15). 
1.2 Preliminary Data  
As prelude to this clinical study, Navidea, in collaboration with Drs. Michael McGrath and Toby 
[CONTACT_862723]206 and the determination of co- localization of these markers using a fluorescent 
congener of tilmanoc ept (Cy -3-tilmanocept; red fluorescence reporting). The results of this study are 
presented in Figure  1, Figure  2, and Figure  3(16). In summary, Cy3-tilmanocept binds to the KS lesions 
with high specificity and sensitivity and co -localizes wit h markers for HHV8, CD68 , and CD163.  All 
of the evidence acquired in this assessment suggests that localization and imaging of not only primary KS lesions but disseminated KS disease will strongly localize Tc 99m tilmanocept.  In addition to the 
ex vivo s tudy, [CONTACT_516610] completed a Phase 2 study, which confirmed that Tc  99m tilmanocept  
administered through a subcutaneous injection localized in KS lesions as well as lymph nodes. Thus, 
this receptor targeting approach to CD206 presents itself as a novel por tal for imaging and staging KS .

1.2.1  Prior Experience of Tilmanocept Injection in KS Patients  
Imaging of KS with high s pecificity and sensitivity has been a remarkable challenge even with today’s 
high resolution technology and available imaging agents(17-29).  In addition to the ex vivo study, [CONTACT_862756] completed a phase II clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_862693]  (UCSF Protocol 14 -[ZIP_CODE]) . Five subjects received a subcutaneous injection of 50 µg 
tilmanocept radiolabeled with 2.0 mCi Tc 99m. No subjects experienced any SAEs. Three AEs were 
reported in two subjects, including peripheral edema (probably not related to study drug or procedures ) 
and fatigue and nausea (possibly related to study drug or procedures). No interaction of tilmanocept 
with HAART therapy or other drugs utilized in the treatement of HIV or HHV8 was observed.  
Tc 99m tilmanocept localized regionally in clinically confirmed KS lesions as well as lymph nodes, as 
shown in Figure  4. Thus, this receptor targeting approach to CD206 presents itself as a novel portal for 
imaging and staging KS. Based on this previous experience, it is anticipated that IV -administered Tc 
99m tilmanocept will be able to systemically localize both cutaneous and non- cutaneous (i.e. visceral 
or CNS) KS lesions.

1.3 Previous Experience with Tc 99m Tilmanocept 
A detailed evaluation of safety and efficacy data from nonclinical and clinical studies can be found in 
the accompanying Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_779644], Inc.  
1.3.1  Nonclinical Evaluations  – IV and Intraperitoneal  Administration  
Nonclinical studies with tilmanocept demonstrated that the drug selectively binds to its intended 
receptor (the MBR), is appropriately distributed for radio detection of lymphatic tissue, and is well tolerated by [CONTACT_116434], rabbits, guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], and dogs. 
PK (pharmacokinetics) data obtained from SC repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs 
demonstrated that  absorption into the plasma was rapid in both species. Urinary excretion was a major 
pathway of elimination. A tissue distribution study demonstrated that tilmanocept exhibited rapid 
clearance from the injection site, rapid uptake by [CONTACT_214958], and low uptake by  [CONTACT_862724]. In addition, subst antial accumulation was noted in the kidneys,  bladder, and bladder 
contents by [ADDRESS_1202703] level (NOAEL) in the definitive repeated dose studies in rats and dogs was 42 μg/kg/day. 
Tilmanocept was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (mouse lymphoma test, Ames test) or in viv o 
(mouse micronucleus test). No signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity were observed in an in vivo study 

Technetium Tc99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals , Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: NAV3 -[ADDRESS_1202704] of the nonclinical safety studies used SC drug administration, a proposed 
route for administration to humans. The human dose f or clinical studies is 50 μg Tilmanocept  per 
procedure, equivalent to 0.714 μg/kg if a conservative estimate of 70 kg is used for human body weight. The single dose administration in animals ranged from 14 to 280 μg/kg in animals, which is 
approximately 20 to 390 times the human μg/kg dose. Repeated doses in animals ranged from 10.5 to 
42 μg/kg/day in animals and are approximately 15 and 60 times the human μg/kg dose. These doses were all well tolerated in the nonclinical studies.  
Dosing in Dogs, Guinea Pig s and Mice:  Intravenous ( IV) dosing nonclinical studies represents 
cumulative dosing in male and female beagle dogs [eight dogs (4/sex; wt females = 7.6 kg;  wt males = 
10.5 kg ) given an IV injection of saline on Study Day (SD) 1 and 2 and DTPA -mannosyl-de xtran at 
0.084 mg/kg on SD 4, 0.42 mg/kg on SD 6, and 0.84 mg/kg on SD 8 and 10] 1,560X the 50 µg and 
195X the 400 µg dose (female dogs) and 1706X the 50 µg dose and 213X the 400µg dose (male dogs).  
Based on the highest single dose administration (0.84 mg/kg) the dogs received 600X the 50 µg and 
75X the 400 µg dose (female dogs) and 657X the 50 µg and 82X the 400 µg dose (male dogs). [NOTE: 
In a separate dog study the dose was 0.56 mg/kg in 2 each male  and female dogs of similar weight/sex), 
no effect was noted in that study, consistent with the higher dose dog study]. 
With regard to the sensitization test (IV administration in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], wt = 0.415 kg) the maximum 
dose was the equivalent of 96X of the anticipat ed high dose tilmanocept. 
Lastly, although intraperitoneal administered in mice, based on the highest single dose administration 
(2000 mg/kg) the mice received 300,000  X the 50 µg and 37,500X the 400 µg dose ( female mice, wt = 
22 gm) and 340,000X the 50 µg and 42,500X the 400 µg dose ( male  mice, wt = 29 gm).

Conclusions from t hese Tests:  
CNS:  In conclusion, a single  IV administration of  tilmanocept was well tolerated in rats at levels of 
0.15, 0.75, and 1.50 mg/kg. Brief sedation shortly after dosing was observed at 0.75 and 1.50 mg/kg, 
which resolved by [CONTACT_862726] -dextran content of tilmanocept. There were no t ilmanocept -related effects on 
functional observational battery parameters. 
Single Bolus Toxicity:  Tilmanocept- related clinical pathology changes were limited to minimally 
greater, dose- related, aspartate aminotransferase values for 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg males and females that 
were likely caused by [CONTACT_779649] -
related clinical pathology parameters. This change had resolved at the en d of the recovery phase.

related gross pathology finding in males at ≥ 0.75 mg/kg. The gross finding of dark focus in the stomach 
correlated microscopi [INVESTIGATOR_862694]. Focal erosion in the stomach 
was test article related in males at ≥0.75 mg/kg, but was considered to be of little toxicological 
significance. No test article -related organ weight changes were noted.  At the end of the recovery phase 
(Day 15), there were no test article- related findings in gross pathology, organ weights, or 
histopathology. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]:  In conclusion, respi[INVESTIGATOR_779616]:CD(SD) rats given a single 
IV injection dose of vehicle control article or 0.150, 0.300, or 0.750 mg/kg of tilmanocept at a dose

with severe abnormal clinical observations of hypoactivity, ataxia, labored or irregular respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and 
pale skin of entire body for animals given 0.750 mg/kg.  Administration of >0.150 mg/kg t ilmanocept 
had no direct effect on respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], but it was associated with higher tidal volume (up to +26, +14, and +50% in animals given 0.150, 0.300, or 0.750 mg/kg, respectively) and higher minute volume (up to +18, +5, and +40% 0.[ADDRESS_1202706] -dose in animals given 0.150, 0.300, or 0.750 mg/kg, 
respectively).

 CYP:   This study was designed to independently evaluate the in vi tro inhibitory effect of tilmanocept 
on major CYP enzymes in human liver microsomes. Specifically, the inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 (utilizing two different substrates) by 
[CONTACT_862727]. 
To evaluate tilmanocept as a direct, time- dependent and metabolism -dependent inhibitor of CYP 
activity, human liver microsomes from a pool of [ADDRESS_1202707], time - or metabolism -
dependent inhibition of any CYP enzyme by [CONTACT_779639]. 
ABC and SLC transporters:  It was found that tilmanocept was not an inhibitor of  human transporters 
(namely P -gp, BRCP, OAT1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2) under the conditions tested.  
Hemolysis:  No hemolysis and no flocculation were observed following in vitro treat ment of human 
whole blood with t ilmanocept at final whole blood concentrations of 2.5, 25 or 250 μg/mL.  
Ion Channels (Na+, K+, Ca2+): Although there is a small dose -dependent effect that is fractional to 
the positive control, variability within concentration renders the median value observations not significantly different (Kruskal -Wallis).  
1.3.2  Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacody namics  in Lymphatic Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_862695]  (Subcutaneous, Peritumoral and Intradermal administration)  
After a single peritumoral (PT), ID, or SC dose  for solid tumor lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , Tc 99m tilmanocept  
demonstrated significantly faster injection site clearance than Tc 99m sulfur colloid (TcSC, filtered and 
unfiltered), the standard imaging agent and comparator used in the Phase 1 trials. 
The mean Tc 99m tilmanocept  injection site clearance half -life was approximatel y 2 to 3 hours vs. 
approximately 15 to 27 hours for TcSC. Absolute uptake in the primary “sentinel” lymph node ( LSN) 
was dose- related for Tilmanocept , although relative nodal uptake  (%ID SN) overall was independent of 
dose and ranged from 0.05%ID SN to 1.81% IDSN, while the TcSC values ranged from 0.64%ID SN to 
3.66%ID SN; differences between Tc 99m tilmanocept and TcSC were not statistically significant.  
In the Phase 2 trial, Tc 99m tilmanocept  was highly effective in identifying tumor -draining lymph nodes 
(i.e., overall, a “hot spot” from Tc 99m tilmanocept  was identified in 93.0% of  patients for whom 
preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed, and the per patient intraoperative localization rate 
was 96.2%). Diagnostic performance of in vivo Tc 99m tilmanoce pt findings relative to pathology 
assessment of tumor tissue indicated a high per tissue sensitivity estimate (overall, 92.0%). The overall 
false negative rate (FNR) for pathology was 8.0%, supporting the accuracy of Tc 99m tilmanocept in 
identifying lymph nodes with a high potential for containing tumor metastases in the lymphatics 
draining the tumor bed. The effect of time between Tc 99m tilmanocept  injection and surgery on the 
localization rate was also evaluated, with surgeries done either on the same day as the Tc 99m 
tilmanocept injection or on the following day. In patients with melanoma, the time interval  made no 
difference in the localization rate. In patients with breast cancer, the same day surgery group had a 
Technetium Tc99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals , Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: NAV3 -24  30 January 2019 
Confidential  Page 26 of 72 
 95.5% (21 out of 22 patients) localization rate compared with 88.9% (8 of 9 patients) in the next -day 
surgery group, although the difference is not statistically  significant  (p = 0.5032, Fisher’s exact test) 
and can be attributed to the small number of breast cancer patients in the next day surgery group, and 
not the time between injection and surgery. 
1.3.3  Clinical Efficacy  in Lymphatic Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/Sentinel Node Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_862696] [ADDRESS_1202708] cancer and 
melanoma, comparing lymph node detection of Tc 99m tilmanocept  and with the  FDA-approved 
intraoperative Tc 99m tilmanocept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (ILM) agent and standard-of- care, vital blue dye (VBD). 
Tc 99m tilmanocept  demonstrated a statistically significant concordance rate with VBD (meta- analysis 
concordance rate = 99.99%, p < 0.0001). 
The detection concordance between Tc 99m tilmanocept  and VBD was similar among  patients with 
melanoma and patients with breast cancer  (meta -analysis concordance rate = 99.99% for both 
populations). Tc 99m tilmanocept  also demonstrated a higher sensitivity for detecting tumor -positive 
(as confirmed by [CONTACT_56618]) lymph nodes, corresponding to a decreased FNR when compared with 
VBD on a pe r node basis. The corresponding sensitivity rate in detection of lymph nodes most likely 
to be positive for tumor cells for Tc 99m tilmanocept  was 99.99%, compared with 78.02% for VBD. 
The FNR for VBD (21.98%) was higher than the FNR for  Tc 99m tilmanocept  (0.01%). These findings 
suggest that, when VBD is used as the imaging agent, there is an increased risk of missing the detection 
of tumor -involved lymph nodes and incorrectly staging cancer patients. The Tc 99m tilmanocept -only 
findings  (pathology- positiv e nodes that were hot/not blue) suggest that Tc 99m tilmanocept  was 
markedly more effective in identifying lymph nodes that harbored disease than was VBD.  Clinical 
safety has been evaluated in an integrated analysis of the pooled safety population  (506 pat ients) from 
six completed trials and one ongoing clinical trial. No on- study deaths  in Tc 99m tilmanocept - treated 
patients have occurred in this population. Twenty- seven  serious adverse events (SAEs) have been 
reported for 26 patients across all Tilmanoce pt studies. None of the SAEs were attributed to the use of 
Tc 99m tilmanocept . No patients were withdrawn from any study due to an SAE or adverse event (AE). 
No clinically significant safety event associated with the use of Tc 99m tilmanocept has been  reported 
in the clinical trials.  
1.3.4  Clinical Safety  using Intradermal, Subcutaneous, Peritumoral, and 
Intravenous  Injections  
Non-IV Experience - Well over 250,000 patients in clinical trials and US commercial use for 
intraoperative lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ( ILM) with se ntinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) have been exposed 
to tilmanocept , and there have been no safety signals, no deaths due to drug, and no SAEs due to 
tilmanocept . There are no known drug interactions leading to contraindications with the use of 
tilmanocept. Post-marketing reports have shown less than 0.12% of subjects experiencing AEs , with 
the most common one being lack of node localization. 
IV Experience - Navidea is currently conducting disease imaging studies in patients with  rheumatoid 
arthritis  (RA) , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), colorectal cancer (CRC) with metast ases to the 
liver, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)  utilizing Tc 99m tilmanocept administered IV. Dosages consist 
of 50, 100, 200 or 400 µg of tilmanocept labeled with 1,  2, 5, or 10 m illicurie (s) (mCi) of 99mTc injected 
IV.  At the time of this writing, sixty  (60) subjects have received IV administration of Tc 99m 
tilmanocept.  No subject has exhibited any adverse reaction to the drug that was related to the drug.

 3 OVERVIEW OF METHODOLOGY AND DESI GN 
3.1 Overall Trial Design  
This is a prospective, single -center, open -label, non-randomized, dose escalation, comparative, safety  
study of IV and SC injected Tc  99m t ilmanocept  in the localization and detection of cutaneous and non-
cutaneo us KS lesions in subjects with biopsy-confirmed KS. This study includes IV administration of  
3 doses Tc 99m tilmanocept: 100µg/ 5 mCi, 100 µg/ 10 mCi and 200µg / 5 mCi . All subjects will receive 
IV administration at one of these  three  doses. Cohort 3 will serve as a comparator arm, and Cohort 3 
subjects will additionally receive a SC injection of Tc 99m tilmanocept at the Cohort 3 dose of 200µg/ 
[ADDRESS_1202709]/CT imaging beginning 60-[ADDRESS_1202710]/CT imaging  twice: first beginning  60-[ADDRESS_1202711]/CT to 
provide greater resolution of areas of Tc 99m tilmanocept localization.   
This study is designed to evaluate the use of Tc 99m tilmanocept as an imaging agent in HIV -positive 
subjects with biopsy-confirmed KS by [CONTACT_862730]-cutaneous lesions.    
No prior clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate IV administration of Tc 99m tilmanocept 
performance in subjects with KS . One previous clinical trial was conducted to evaluate SC 
administratio n of Tc 99m tilmanocept performance in subjects with KS. The rationale for evaluating 
Tc 99m tilmanocept in this subject population is discussed in Section 1.[ADDRESS_1202712]; the investigator may not modify or alter the procedures described in this protocol. If protocol 
modifications are necessary, all alterations that are not solely of an administrative nature require a 
formal protocol amendment for the involvement of the Institutional Revie w Board(s) ( IRB(s)).  
If an investigator has deviated from the protocol in order to eliminate an immediate hazard to subjects 
or for other inevitable medical reasons, the investigator shall document all such deviations, including 
the reasons thereof, and su bmit the document to the sponsor and the head of the medical institution as

Subjects who sign an informed consent form (ICF) but are ultimately not enrolled in the trial will be 
considered screen failures. Subjects will be assigned a subject identification number at the time the ICF is signed.  A subject will be considered enrolled  once injected with technetium Tc 99m  on Day 1. 
Demographic data and the reason for the screen failure will be collected for all screen failure subjects.  Enrollment will continue until a total of up to [ADDRESS_1202716] numbers are to be assigned in a sequential manner using the following format:  
Digits 1 to 2: Trial number 24  
Digits 3 to 4: Site number (e.g., “01”)  
Digits 5 to 7: Sequential subject number (e.g., “001”, “002”, “003”)

5.[ADDRESS_1202719] Dosage and Administration  
This study includes IV administration of  3 dose s Tc 99m tilmanocept : 100µg/ 5 mCi, 100  µg/ 10 mCi, 
and 200 µg/ 5 mCi. All subjects will receive IV administration at one of these three doses. Cohort 3 
will serve as a comparator arm, and Cohort 3 subjects will additionally receive a SC injection of Tc 
99m tilmanocept at the Cohort 3 dose  of 200  µg/ 5 mCi ( see Table  1). At least one subject enrolled into 
each cohort must meet inclusion criteria 4c (suspected non -cutaneous or confirmed non-cutaneous KS), 
as described in Section 4.1.

Cohort 2  100 µg/ 10 mCi  IV n = 4  
Cohort 3  200 µg/ 5 mCi  IV and SC  n = up to 6  
 
All s ubjects will receive Tc 99m tilmanocept through an IV route of administration. A single syringe 
will be used and injected as a slow push into the venous catheter . The preferred site of catheter 
placement will be the left or right antecubital vein.  Injection volume will be 1.0 mL in sterile normal 
saline. At the completion of the injection, a 10 cc sterile normal sal ine flush will be administered.  
Cohort 3 subjects will also receive Tc 99m tilmanocept through a SC route of admini stration. Two 
syringes will be used and injected bilaterally as a slow push into the ankle(s) or the dorsal surface of 
the foot  (feet). Total injection volume will be 1.0 mL ( 0.5 in each syringe) in sterile normal saline.  
Each syringe will contain half of the intended total dose of 200 µg/ 5 mCi (100 µg/ 2.5 mCi per syringe).   
 
5.3 Treatment Assignment  
In this prospective, single center, open- label, non-randomized, dose- escalation , comparative,  safety 
study, Cohort 1 subjects will receive an IV administration of 100 µg/ 5 mCi Tc 99m tilmanocept. Cohort 
2 subjects will receive an IV administration of 100 µg/ 10 mCi Tc 99m tilmanocept . Cohort 3 subjects 
will receive a SC and an IV ad ministration of 200 µg / 5 mCi Tc 99m tilmanocept  approximately one 
week apart . Cohort 1 will be the starting dose group. Four subjects will be enrolled into Cohort 1.  
If one of the four Cohort 1 subjects experiences a noxious pharmacologic activity /an ADR , two  more 
subjects will be treated at the same tilmanocept mass dose  and same radiolabel  level  as the subject with 
the ADR . If 2 out of 4 or 3 out of 6 subjects experience s a noxious pharmacologic activity /an ADR  in

 Cohort 1, the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) cannot be determined. If no additional noxious 
pharmacologic activit ies/ADRs  are observed in the expanded cohort, the dose escalation will continue 
with Cohort 2. If one additional noxious pharmacologic activity /ADR  is observed, the current dose will 
be deemed the MTD. If more than one additional  pharmacologic activity or  ADR  is observed in the 
expanded cohort , the previous dose will be deemed the MTD.  
If no noxious pharmacologic activities /ADRs are experienced in Cohort 1, Cohort [ADDRESS_1202720] dose  level at which no 
more than 33% of subjects experienced an ADR . Visual representation of the dose escalation scheme 
may be found in Appendix 2.  NOTE: Adverse Drug Reaction  
An Adverse Drug R eaction (ADR) includes all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal 
product related to any dose  or dose regimen.  The phrase “r esponses to a medicinal product ” means 
that a casual relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable 
possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out.

In Nuclear Medicine, prior to IV injection and imaging, an indwe lling catheter will be placed for venous 
access. The preferred site of IV placement should be the left or right antecubital vein . Other IV access 
sites are acceptable if access is problematic.  
The filled syringe will be connected to the catheter  for a slow push injection. Immediately after the 
completion of the injection, a 10 cc sterile normal saline flush will be administered. Injection of Tc 99m 
tilmanocept will be at study time 0:00.  
For SC injection, t he preferred site of placement is the an kle(s) or the dorsal surface of the foot (feet). 
Approximately 0.5 mL of the 1.0 mL prepared injection shall be administered to each the left and right 
leg. Injection of Tc  99m tilmanocept will be at study time 0:00.

The camera used to obtain the images should be a 2- headed SPECT or SPECT/CT camera equipped 
with a low -energy, high -resolution collimator with a 15% window (20% can be used if 15% setting not 
available)  centered over a 140keV peak.   
The camera must have passed  the daily SPECT QC  (quality control)  tests as per the manufacturer’s 
recommendation for that day’s scan schedule.  
Whenever possible, subject should be asked to void after injection and prior to the imaging session.

8.6 Safety  
8.6.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Adverse Event  
The definitions below follow International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) – Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) (see also ICH Guidelin e for Clinical Safety Data Management:  Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting). 
Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a caus al relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.   
Any clinically significant change in a condition (worsening) from screening that  results in a change in 
subject management will be considered an AE and will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. 
By [CONTACT_214976], all untoward medical occurrences beginning on the day of Visit 2 Baseline 
(Day 1)  through the Follow -up Phone Call  are to be reported as AEs.  AEs continuing after study 
completion will be followed to normalization or stabilization.  Additionally, untoward medical events 
occurring prior to the day of Tc 99m tilmanocept  administration will be collect ed and added to the 
subject’s medical history unless they are related to a study  procedure, in which case the event will be 
recorded as an AE . SAEs will be reported from the time of consent through the end of participation. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Categories for Adverse Event Assessment  
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_104709] . 
Seriousness  
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Technetium Tc99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals , Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: NAV3 -24  30 January 2019 
Confidential  Page 43 of 72 
 Severity  
The severity of an AE is classified according to the fo llowing categories, taking into account the 
possible range of the intensity of the event:  
• Mild - The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
• Moderate -  The AE  causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual 
activities. 
• Severe -  The AE  causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities and 
may be incapacitating or life-threatening. 
 
Specific drug treatment  
Any specific drug treatment will be documented.  
Causal relationship to investigational product 
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the 
use of investigational product:  
Definitely related:  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_779658]. 
Probably related:  Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_862736]’s clinical state or other 
agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Possibly related:  Event may be explained by [CONTACT_862737] s ubject’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Probably not related: Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], rather than the investigational product. 
Definitely not related:  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
For causality assessments, events meeting the categories of definitely, probably, or possibly related will 
be considered to be related to investigational product.  
Causal relationship to study procedure  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the 
study procedure :  
Definitely related:  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_161473]. 
Probably related:  Event is most likely to be e xplained by [CONTACT_862738]’s 
clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessments and Documentation of Adverse Events  
Attention shall be paid to the occurrence of AEs for the duration of subject participation. Events 
occurring prior to Visit 2 (day of Tc 99m tilmanocept administration) will be recorded in the subject’s medical history  unless determined to be related to the study procedure . Untoward medical events 
beginning on Visit 2 (day of Tc 99m tilmanocept a dministration)  through the completion of the Follow -
up Phone Call  will be reported as adverse events.  Thus, subject s should be closely observed by [CONTACT_862739].   
Any AE (observed, volunteered, or elicited) should be recorded in detail in the source documentation. 
The following information is required:  
• The date  and time of onset of any AE. 
• The duration (the entire duration of an event or symptom, calculated from date of onset to 
date of end, if not recorded directly).  
• The seriousness of the AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_093].  If the investigator deems that 
an AE qualifies as an SAE, a special form provided by [CONTACT_862740].  A d efinition of SAEs  is provided in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
• The maximum intensity (mild, moderate, or severe). 
• Whether drug treatment was administered for the event, any spe cific drug treatment must be 
documented. 
• The relationship of the AE to the investigational product and to study conduct (for 
definitions, see above). 
The outcome  of the AE (resolved, resolved with sequelae, not resolved, unknown, death). 
 
AEs will be coded  according to an internationally recognized dictionary (Medical Dictionary for

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Expected Adverse Events  
Investigational Product -Related Risks  
In all completed studies of Lymphoseek involving 553 subjects, only three events ( breast pain and 
injection site pain reported by [CONTACT_214983] a 
subject with head and neck squamous cell cancer) were deemed definitely related to the administration 
of Lymphoseek by [CONTACT_093].  The most common adverse reactions (incident <1%) have been 
lack of effect (<0.067%), injection site pain (<0.02%) and rash (<0.02%) .  
In addition to the Lymphoseek pre -approval clinical studies, post -marketing surveillance shows that 
Lymphoseek has been administered to more than 250,[ADDRESS_1202760] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure).  Any adverse 
experience that is not listed in the current Investigator’s Brochure or which is, with regard to the 
specificity or severity, not consistent with the risk information shall be regarded as unexpected.  
Examples would be (a) acute renal failure listed in the Investigator’s Brochure with a subsequent new 
report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis.  “Unexpected” 
as used in this definition refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed and included in the Investigator’s Brochure , rather than from the perspective of such experience not 
being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the investigational product. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
Definition  
The following SAE definition is based on ICH guidelines and the final rule issued by [CONTACT_4469] (FDA) and effective [ADDRESS_1202761] medical occurrence that at any dose : 
• results in death, or  
Technetium Tc99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals , Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: NAV3 -24  30 January 2019 
Confidential  Page 46 of 72 
 • is life threatening, or 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• is an important medical event (see paragraphs below).  
The term ‘life threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
Medical and scientific j udgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to report an 
AE as serious also in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be  immediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626123] e subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should also 
usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Actions and reporting obligations in case of serious adverse events  
The investigator should take appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures to minimize the risk to 
the subject.   
If any SAE occurs over the course of the study, investigators or other site personnel will inform Navidea 
Biopharmaceutical representatives within one day (i.e., within 24 hours) of becoming aware of the 
SAE. Written notification of the S AE will be emailed to Navidea Biopharmaceuticals 
Pharmacovigilance at [EMAIL_4182] . For fatal or life -threatening adverse events where 
important or relevant information is missing, active follow -up is undertaken immediately. 
Pregnancy will have the same time reporting obligations to the sponsor as SAEs. Upon notification, Navidea will provide a form for collection of pregnancy information. 
All SAEs must also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRFs.  
Notification of the IRB(s)  
The sponsor and/or the inve stigator will notify the IRB(s)  about all relevant events (e.g., SAEs and 
Suspected, Unexpected, Serious Adverse Reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]) according to all applicable regulations.  
Notification of the authorities  
The sponsor will process and report all relevant events (e.g., SAEs, S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the authorities 
according to all applicable regulations.  
Sponsor’s notification of the investigators  
The sponsor will inform all investigators about reported relevant events (e.g., SAEs, S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to all applicable reg ulations.

 8.6.2  Further Safety Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Exam  
A complete physical examination at screening will be conducted according to the Schedule of Study 
Events (see Appendix 1). Height and body weight will be collected. 
Physical examinations will be performed for the following body systems: 
• General Appearance  
• Skin/dermatological  
• Eyes, ears, nose, throat  
• Head and neck (including thyroid) 
• Lungs 
• Heart  
• Abdomen (liver, kidney, spleen, gastrointestinal)  
• Lymph nodes  
• Musculoskeletal  
• Nervous system  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained at screening  and within [ADDRESS_1202762] 1 minute. No continuous ECG monitoring will be required.  At a minimum the heart rate, QRS, 
PR and QT intervals will be collected.  QTc will be calculated using the Fridericia formula.  
On-site investigator’s responsibilities  
The immediate cardiac safety of the subject will be ensured by [CONTACT_21639] -site qualified physician.  A ny 12-
lead ECG intervals, waveform abnormalities, and rhythm changes that are clinically significant in that 
they result in a change in  subject management will be considered an AE.  In the case of an SAE, once 
SAE notification is decided upon, investigators are required to follow the procedure described for SAE 
notification and document abnormal ECG findings (intervals and waveforms).  Any interval data or 
abnormal waveform finding that resulted in an AE (i.e., change of patient management) must be 
followed to normalization or stabilization.  
Each 12- lead ECG tracing must be signed and dated and stored in the subject’s source documentation.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise the measurement of body temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure. All measurements will be taken after the subject has been in a resting position 
for at least 1 minute .  
Technetium Tc99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals , Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: NAV3 -[ADDRESS_1202763]- injection .   
Any clinically significant change from screening (worsening) that results in a change in subject 
management will be considered an AE and will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Parameters for Screening and Safety  
Clinical laboratory tests to be evaluated in this study include hematology, serum chemistry,  and 
urinalysis .  Clinical laboratory tests  will include the following  as defined in  Table  2. 
Table  2. Clinical Laboratory Parameters  
Hematology Leukocytes,  hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (HCT),  neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, red blood cells 
(RBC), platelets  
Serum chemistry   
 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
alkaline phosphatase, total  bilirubin, creatinine, chloride, potassium, 
sodium, total protein, albumin, globulin, carbon dioxide (CO 2), blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN)  
Urinalysis  pH, specific gravity  
 
The site laboratory will provide the necessary supplies to collect the blood and urine samples.  
All laboratory reports must be promptly reviewed for clinical significance  by [CONTACT_093], and upon 
review, initialed  and dated by [CONTACT_093]. 
Good clinical practice would suggest that a copy of the laboratory results also be provided to the 
subject’s referring physician.  
Any change in a laboratory value, which results in a change in subject management (additional controls 
or treatment required), will be reported as a clinically significant change. Clinically significant changes 
in laboratory parameters, which are not the result of laboratory error, are to be recorded as AEs.  
Any clinically significant changes in laboratory values are to be followed up with repeated tests at 
appropriate intervals (as determined by [CONTACT_093]) until  the values return to baseline level or until 
the abnormality is explained by [CONTACT_093].  
The expected amount of blood to be withdrawn is shown in Table 3.

 9 STATISTICAL METHODS  
The study is a prospective, open-label, single -center, dose escalation , comparative,  safety study of 
injected Tc 99m tilmanocept in the detection of and assessment of localization to cutaneous KS or non-
cutaneous focus (visceral or other, e.g. CNS  [central nervous system] ) in HIV -positive subjects with 
active KS by [CONTACT_862741]/CT ima ging.  The dose escalation portion of the study is a 4+2 design 
with no dose de -escalation.  The statistical objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) of Tc 99m tilmanocept and to compare the capabilities of Tc  99m tilmanocept  to localize 
in cutaneous and non-cutaneous sites of KS. A study center is defined as a treatment administration site 
or cohort of treatment administration sites under the control and supervision of the same PI .   
9.[ADDRESS_1202764] ’s 
participation in the trial following Tc 99m tilmanocept injection.  The primary safety endpoint will be 
computed as the proportion of subjects with an ADR.  
9.3 Efficacy Variables  
The efficacy variables for this study are as follows:  
• Nuclear medicine specialist determination of presence/absence of illumination (i.e., 
localization positive/negative, anatomic site) relative  to background from SPECT imaging 
results for each subject;  
• Clinically identified presence/absence of KS (based on any  previous diagnostic evaluations );   
• Quantitative SPECT gamma counts for each  biopsied lesion . 
 
The efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows:  
• Per subject localization rate of Tc 99m tilmanocept in at least one KS suspected or confirmed 
lesion by [CONTACT_862713]/or SPECT /CT imaging  
• Per lesion /region  concordance of Tc 99m localization with anatomical areas of active KS 
defined by [CONTACT_862742] d diagnosis or clinical symptomology  
• Localization intensity for each biopsied and clinically defined lesion  as determined by 
[CONTACT_779665]  
• Per biopsied lesion proportion of CD206- expressing cells and total CD206 as determined by  
[CONTACT_862743]  
• Per lesion/region c oncordance of IV vs SC Tc 99m localization with anatomical areas of 
active KS defined by [CONTACT_862716].  
• Per subject localization rate of Tc 99m tilmanocept in areas other t han KS by [CONTACT_862713]/or  
SPECT/CT imaging  
Technetium Tc99m tilmanocept   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals , Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: NAV3 -24  30 January 2019 
Confidential  Page 51 of 72 
 • Per area localization rate of Tc 99m tilmanocept in the most frequently identified areas other 
than KS by [CONTACT_862713]/or SPECT /CT imaging  
 
A localized subject is one for whom Tc  99m by [CONTACT_862713]/or SPECT /CT imaging results in the 
illumination of at least one site relative to background as determined by [CONTACT_862744].   
A localized  KS lesion is a lesion that is  both clinically identified  or suspected KS  and planar or 
SPECT /CT illuminated . 
Localization in areas other than KS  will also be defined per subject and per area,  where these areas are  
clinically negative KS locations based on clinical symptomology. 
9.4 Sample Size Justification  
The dose escalation portion of this study is a design with no dose de -escalation. The sequential cohort 
enrollment characteristics of this design do not allow a fixed computation of sample size.  In a previous 
study with subjects receiving a 200 µg dose radiolabeled at 5 mCi (i.e., the maximum dose planned for 
this study), zero (0) subjects had an ADR.  Therefore, it is expected that no subjects will have an ADR 
in this study and that each cohort will enroll the planned sample size of subjects.  With [ADDRESS_1202765] , it is anticpated that the study will enroll up to n=14 subjects.    
  
9.5 Statistical Analyses  
9.5.1  Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be defined for the study: 
• Intent -to-Diagnose (IT D) Population - Subjects who are enrolled in the study, injected with 
Tc 99m tilmanocept, and are imaged will be included in the IT D analysis population. 
• Safety Population  – All subjects  who are enrolled in the study and are injected with Tc 99m 
tilmanocept will be included in the safety population. 
 
All safety data analyses will be conducted on the safety population.  All efficacy data analyses will be conducted on the ITD population.

Per region lesion localization of Tc 99m tilmanocept by [CONTACT_862713]/or SPECT /CT imaging  will be 
computed across all biopsy -confirmed or clinically suspected KS lesions of all subjects.  A 95% exact 
confidence interval on per region lesion localization will be calculated.  This analysis will be performed 
by [CONTACT_2715]. 
Localization intensities of biopsied lesions will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, maximum and range) for each dose.  
Per biopsied lesion proportion of CD206-expressing cells and quantity of CD206 as determined by 
[CONTACT_862745] (mean, median, standard

lesion sites will asse ssed with a cross- tabulation including the joint probability distribution. The site 
will be the sampling unit for this analysis. An exact version of McNemar’s test will be performed, 
testing the null hypothesis

𝐻𝐻𝐴𝐴:π𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼≠ π𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 
whereπIV andπ𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 represent the probabilities of localization with IV (only) tilmanocept and localization 
with SC tilmanocept only respectively.  
In addition, descriptive statistics will be generated relative to the concordance and reverse concordance 
of  observed sites of discrete localization of Tc 99m tilmanocept following IV and SC administration.  
The number and percentage of subjects with at least one anatomical site other than KS that has been 
localized with Tc 99m tilmanocept by [CONTACT_862746].  A 95% exact confidence

Locations showing  localization of Tc 99m tilmanocept by [CONTACT_862713]/or SPECT/CT  imaging  that are  
not locations of  biopsy- confirmed or clinically suspected KS sites will be computed across all sites in 
all subjects .  A 95% exact confidence interval on per location localization will be calculated.  This 
analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_151694].

 10 DATA HANDLING AND QU ALIT Y ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Recording 
Data required according to this protocol are to be entered into the CRFs (provided by [CONTACT_456]) as 
soon as possible. 
10.1.1  eCRF Design  
Electronic  CRFs  (eCRFs)  will be used for collecting all data generated during the trial.  eCRF 
completion details will be documented in a separate document that will be provided by [CONTACT_862748].  
10.2 Monitoring 
This trial will be monitored regularly by a clinical research associate (CRA) from the sponsor or a 
contract research organization (CRO).  Monitoring procedures include one or more visits designed to 
clarify all prerequisites before the trial  starts  and will be governed by a trial- specific monitoring plan .  
Interim monitoring visits will take place on a regular basis according to a schedule fixed by [CONTACT_11402].  During these visits, the CRA will check for completion of the data entries, their compliance 
with the  protocol and with GCP, and will compare the e CRFs with the source data.  
All data recorded in the eCRF will be captured in the source documentation.  
The CRA will verify the correct use of the investigational product.  The investigational product will not be supplied to the investigator site prior to a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_862699], if appropriate, from the radiation protection authorities. 
In addition, the CRA will determine whether all AEs and SAEs have been appropriately reported 
(including adherence to the time periods required for SAEs). 
10.3 Data Processing 
Trial  data documentation will be maintained specifying all relevant aspects of data processing for the 
trial (including data validation, cleaning, correcting, releasing).  This documentation will be stored in 
the TMF.  
For data coding (e.g., AEs, medication, medical/surgical history), internationally recognized and 
accepted dictionaries will be used.  
10.4 Auditing 
A member of the sponsor’s (or a designated CRO) quality assurance unit may arrange to visit the 
investigator in order to audit the performance of the study at the trial site and the trial documents 
originating there.  The auditor(s) will usually be accompanied by a CRA or the trial team lead.  The 
investigator will be informed about the outcome of the audit. 
In addition, inspections by [CONTACT_862749](s)  [independent ethics 
committee] /IRB(s) are possible at any time.  The investigator is to notify the sponsor of any such 
inspection immediately.

Based on this consent form and , if required, the subject information sheet, the investigator will explain 
all relevant aspects of the trial to each subject, before his/her entry into the trial  (i.e., before 
examinations and procedures associated with selection for the trial are performe d).  
The investigator will also mention that written approval of the IRB/IEC has been obtained.  Each subject will have ample time and opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the 
right to withdraw from the trial at any time without any disa dvantage and without having to provide 
reasons for this decision.  
Following this informative discussion, the subject will be asked if he/she is willing to sign and 
personally date a statement of informed consent. Only if the subject voluntarily agrees to sign the informed consent form and has done so, may he/she enter the trial. Additionally, the investigator or 
his/her nominated designee will personally sign and date the form, too. The subject will receive a 
duplicate of the signed and dated form.  
The investigator will record in the source documentation the time and date of obtaining informed 
consent.  
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that screening trial  procedures are performed, 
the trial record or subject's clinical record mu st clearly show that informed consent was obtained prior 
to these procedures.  The informed consent form and any other written information provided to subjects will be revised 
whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, 
or there is an amendment to the protocol which necessitates a change to the content of the subject 
information and/or the written informed consent form. The investigator will inform the subject of 
changes in a timely manner and will ask  the subject t o confirm his/her participation in the trial by

KS LESION ASSESSMENT  
 
A “KS- suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]” lesion is defined as a lesion that is either known to be KS (by [CONTACT_862752]) or clinically 
suspected to be KS.  In the questions below, when asked about KS -suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352], consider only those which are 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_862705], regardless if they are flat or raised.  Do not count lesions which 
have subcutaneous swelling alone , without hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] , as KS-suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665] . 
A. Overall Cutaneous   Do not count  oral cavity  lesions.  
1.  Overall inventory: How many KS -suspi[INVESTIGATOR_862706]?   1-49  ≥ 50 
2.  Indicate if KS -suspi[INVESTIGATOR_862707].

Lesion Counts  
Include only KS -suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352] (do not include lesions with subcutaneous swelling alone).  
If ≥ [ADDRESS_1202786] combined count. Indicate the sites using the corresponding 
codes above. Do not use the mouth.  If lesions are only present in the mouth, go to question 4.  
If < 50 lesions overall, enter code 11 (“total body”) as the representative area.  
Definition of a flat lesion: Area of skin that is hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_862708] (i.e., the borders are not palpable; e.g., 
macule or patch are examples  of flat lesions).   
Definition of a raised lesion: any lesion that protrudes from skin surface and is palpable (e.g., plaque, nodule, or 
tumor)

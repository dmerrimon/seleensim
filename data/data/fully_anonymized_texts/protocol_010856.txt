8 December  2015  11 error of 5%.  This effect size (treatment difference / pooled SD) 
translates into a treatment dif ference in change from baseline to month 
[ADDRESS_1204035] deviation and range will be given for the

using co unts and percentages by [CONTACT_239622].   
Efficacy Analysis. The main population for efficacy will be the 
modified intention -to-treat population (MITT), defined as all 
participant s randomized  and receive at least one dose of study drug .  
Subjects will be analyzed by [CONTACT_220261]. No adjustment for 
multiplicity will be made. The change from baseline in mRSS will be 
summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_15449]. Differences from 
baseline will be calculated and summarized as abo ve, with a 95% 
confidence interval for the mean.    The difference between treatment 
groups in change from baseline to  Month 12  in mRSS  scores  will be 
evaluated using an ANCOVA model with terms for treatment group, 
duration of dcSSc disease (stratification factor) and baseline mRSS  
score.  
Secondary and exploratory efficacy variables that are continuous 
measures will be analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy analyses. 
Exploratory efficacy measures that are categorical will be analyzed 
using the chi -squar e test. They will be summarized by [CONTACT_863409], overall, and by [CONTACT_1570]. P -values from the secondary 
and exploratory efficacy analyses will be considered nominal.   The 
sensitivity of the results for mRSS  to missing data assumptions wil l be 
explored as outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) for the 
study. Examination of treatment effects over time may be examined

sample sizes.  Additional exploratory analyses may b e performed and 
will be defined and outlined in the SAP for the study.  
 
1 INTRODUCTION  
Systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma, SSc) is one of the most fatal rheumatic diseases, and is associated with 
substantial morbidity1 and many detrimental effects on health -related quality of life. Recent years have 
seen a revolution in the development and validation of outcome measures2-4 and refinement of trial 
methodology in SSc5. This is paralleled by [CONTACT_863410]6, 7 and 
development of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]8, 9. Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) a measure of skin 
thickness10, 11, has been used as the primary outcom e measure in clinical trials of diffuse cutaneous SSc 
(called diffuse SSc or d cSSc from here on). Food and Drug Administration considers improvement in 
mRSS as an approvable end point.  
Several observations support the role of activated T cells in the path ogenesis of SSc.  Skin biopsies 
obtained from SSc patients early in their disease demonstrate a perivascular, mononuclear cell infiltrate 
comprised of T cells and macrophage.  T cell activation is a prominent feature in SSc, as demonstrated 
by [CONTACT_863411] T cells bearing activation markers, such as IL -[ADDRESS_1204036] of blockade of T cell co -stimulation with intravenous abatacept 
in patients with dSSc  showed efficacy and not serious or unanticipated adverse events. Therefore, we 
aim to perform a phase II , multi -center double -blind randomized controlled trial of subcutaneous 
abatacept vs. placebo in patients with early dcSSc. 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  13 1.1 Summary of Results of Investigational Program  
1.1.1 Pharmacology of Abatacept  
Abatacept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CTLA4 and a 
fragment (hinge - CH2 -CH3 domains) of the Fc domain of human IgG1 that has been modified to 
prevent complement fixation and antibody -dependent  cellular cytotoxicity.  
Abatacept is the first drug in a new class of agents termed “selective costimulation modulators.” 
Abatacept binds specifically to the CD80 and CD86 molecules, proteins prominently displayed on the 
surface of antigen -presenting cells (APCs). Activation of naive T  cells during an immune response 
require s two stimuli from APCs. The first signal is antigen -specific; antigens are presented by [CONTACT_85804], 
with the signal transmitted to the T  cell through the T  cell’s antigen receptor. The second, or 
costimulatory, signal is not antigen -specific and is delivered fo llowing the engagement of a 
costimulatory ligand on the APC with a cognate receptor on the T  cell. 
A key costimulatory receptor on T  cells is CD28. CD28 is constitutively expressed on resting T  cells and 
binds to both CD80 (B7 -1) and CD86 (B7 -2) on the APC12-15. A costimulatory signal is required not 
only for the full activation of n aive T  cells, but also may be required for the survival of memory and 
autoimmune effector cells16, 17. At 24 to  48 hours following T  cell activation, the T  cell expresses 
CTLA4 on its surface, which engages the CD80 and CD86 molecules on the APC surface interfering 
with CD28’s ability to bind to its ligands on the APC; CD80 and CD86 preferentially bind to CTLA4 
with a much higher avidity than with CD28. Although the precise mechanisms are as yet unclear, 
CTLA4 expression is associated w ith a decrease in T  cell activation.  
After the T  cell activity has been dampened, the CTLA4 recycles into the T  cell’s cytoplasm. The 
CTLA4 section of abatacept binds specifically to CD80 and CD86 (B7 -1 and B7 -2, respectively) and 
down -modulates the CD28 -mediated costimulation of T  cells. Thus, abatacept uses a segment of a 
molecule that is part of the normal immune homeostatic mechanism to suppress T  cell activity involved 
in the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The FC region of abatacept was eng ineered with 
several point mutations designed to inactivate it. Because of these changes, abatacept does not mediate 
pathways such as antibody -dependent  cell cytotoxicity or complement -dependent cytotoxicity18. 
1.1.2 Human Pharmacokinetics of Abatacept  
Single subcutaneous ( SC) doses of abatacept (50  to 150 mg) demonstrated approximately dose 
proportional PK in healthy adult participant s19. Following administration of single doses of 50  to 150  mg 
of abatacept, the mean Cmax increased from 3.5 to 10.7  μg/mL and the geometric mean AUC ( INF) 
increased from 1490 to 4270  μghour/mL. The median time to occurrence of Cmax (Tmax) following 
SC administration ranged between 48  and 168  hours. Mean T 1/2 values in healthy participant s ranged 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  14 from 11.2 to 14.7  days. T 1/2 values from this study were comparable with the T 1/2 values ob tained with 
abatacept administered IV to participant s with RA (13  to 14 days)20. The fact that T 1/2 values following 
SC dosing were comparable to T 1/2 values obtained after IV dosing suggests that the elimination 
characteristics of abatacept were not altered following SC administration.  
A double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multiple -dose study (IM101063) 
assessed the steady -state t rough serum concentrations of abatacept following SC administration in 
participant s with RA21. Subjects were randomized to receive either abatacept or placebo in 1 of 5 
parallel groups  based on body weight obtained at the screening visit (Table 1.3.2 A). The SC dose 
regimens were selected to target t rough levels between 10 -30 ug/mL , which was associated with 
efficacy with the IV formulation.

Document Control No. 930025069.  
 
On Day 1, participant s received a single IV infusion (loading dose) of abatacept or placebo, based on 
their weight range. Approximately [ADDRESS_1204037] etion of the IV infusion, participant s received 
their assigned SC dose of abatacept or placebo. Abatacept or placebo was administered weekly by [CONTACT_863412], at the same dose as the SC dose on Day 1, for a total of 12 SC injections. Blood samples for 
PK analysis were collected on Day 1 prior to and at the end of the IV infusion. In addition, blood 
samples were collected prior to each weekly SC dose of abatacept.  
Steady -state trough serum concentrations were achieved after ~ 4 to 5 weeks following the combin ed 
regimen of a single IV loading dose and weekly SC injections. With the exception of treatment group 4 
(abatacept 125 mg SC weekly dose for participant s weighing > 100 kg), the mean steady -state trough 
concentrations across all other treatment groups app eared to be comparable.  
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  15 However, to truly represent the steady -state serum levels from SC administration without the 
contribution of the IV loading dose, Cmin values on Days 71 -85 were selected, since contribution from 
IV was expected to be negligible. Co mparison of mean steady -state trough concentrations on Day 71, 78 
and 85 indicated that abatacept did not appear to accumulate following weekly dosing (Table  1.3.2B).

1.1.3 Clinical Safety with Abatacept SC Formulation  
The safety experience with SC abatacept was characterized in 2 ways: events during cumulative SC 
period and events during the comparative SC/IV period. The key safety findings b ased on th ese analyses 
are listed below22.   
The cumulative SC  period, during which 1879 participant s received SC abatacept for a total exposure 
of 1945.60 p erson -years (p -y), was based on cumulative (short term / long term ) pooled data of the Phase 
2 and 3b studies from:  
 All participant s in the SC abatacept treatment group in the ST period of IM101174  
 All participant s in the IV abatacept treatment group in the ST period of IM1 [ZIP_CODE]  (including the 
anti-TNF failure substudy) who were treated with SC abatacept in the LT period, from the start o f 
SC abatacept in the LT period  
 All participant s in ST abatacept treatment groups from IM101063  
 All participant s in the ST placebo group from IM101063 who were treated with SC abatacept in 
the LT period, from the start o f SC abatacept in the LT period  
 All treated participant s in I M101167, IM101173, and IM101185

 Infection and infestation AEs were reported in 756 (40.2%) participant s with an incidence rate 
(per 100 p -y of exposure) of 54.94. The majority of infections wer e of mild to moderate intensity. 
The cumulative SC period incidence rate of infections and infestation AEs was consistent with 
previous IV abatacept experience.  
 Malignancies were reported in 20 (1.1%) participant s with an incidence rate (per 100 p -y of 
exposure) of 1.04. Malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer  ( NMSC ) were reported in 
9 (0.5%) participant s with an incidence rate (per 100 p -y of exposure) of 0.46. The cumulative SC 
period incidence rate of malignancies was consistent with previous I V abatacept experience.  
 Pre-specified autoimmune events were reported in 17 (0.9%) participant s with an incidence rate 
(per 100 p -y of exposure) of 0.88; most were of mild to moderate intensity with the exception of 
1 severe event (vasculitis). One pre -specified autoimmune event was reported as serious 
(sarcoidosis of moderate intensity), which led to premature discontinuation. The cumulative SC 
period incidence rate of autoimmune events was consistent with underlying disease and previous 
IV abatacept exper ience.  
 Pre-specified local injection site reactions were reported in 58 (3.1%) participant s with an 
incidence rate (per 100 p -y of exposure) of 3.09. Most local injection site reactions were of mild 
to moderate intensity; 1 event (severe injection site re action) was serious and led to premature 
discontinuation.  
 Systemic injection reaction AEs were reported in 131 (7.0%) participant s with an incidence rate 
(per 100 p -y of exposure) of 7.21. Most events were of mild to moderate intensity; none were 
serious; 1 event (moderate angioedema) led to premature discontinuation.

abatacept groups, respectively. Of these, 2 malignancies from each group were non -melanoma 
skin cancers (NMSC).  
 Pre-specified autoimmune events were reported in 7 (1.0%) and 6 (0.8%) participant s in the SC 
abatacept and IV abatacept groups, respectively; all events were of mild to moderate intensity.  
 Pre-specified local injection site reactions were reported in 19 (2. 6%) and 18 (2.5%) participant s 
in the SC abatacept and IV abatacept (i.e., SC placebo) groups, respectively. All pre -specified 
local injection site reactions were of mild to moderate intensity; none led to premature 
discontinuation.  
 Systemic injection rea ction AEs were reported in 56 (7.6%) and 56 (7.8%) participant s in the SC 
abatacept and IV abatacept groups; respectively. No serious systemic injection reactions were 
reported in the SC abatacept group; 1 participant  in the IV abatacept group had serious systemic 
injection reactions (nausea and headache). In both treatment groups, most pre -specified systemic 
injection reaction AEs were of mild or moderate intensity; none led to premature discontinuation.  
 Pre-specified acute infusional AEs were reported in  20 (2.7%) and 16 (2.2%) participant s in the

1.1.4 Drug -Related Adverse Event s 
Injection Site Reactions in Adult RA Patients Treated with Subcutaneous Abatacept  
IM101 -174 compared the safety of abatacept including injection site reactions following subcutaneous 
or intravenous administration. The overall frequency of injection site reactions was 2.6% (19/736) and 
2.5% (18/721) for the subcutaneous abatacept group and the intravenous abatacept group (subcutaneous 
placebo), respectively. All these injection site reactions (including hematoma, pruritus, and erythema) 
were mild (83%) to moderate (17%) in severity, and none necessitated drug discontinuation.  
Immunogenicity in Adult RA Patients Treated with Subcutaneous Abatacept  
IM101 -174 compared the immunogenicity to abatacept following subcutaneous or intravenous 
administration. The ove rall immunogenicity frequency to abatacept was 1.1% (8/725) and 2.3% 
(16/710) for the subcutaneous and intravenous groups, respectively. The rate is consistent with previous 
experience, and there was no correlation of immunogenicity with effects on pharmac okinetics, safety, or 
efficacy.

the end of period 3, when all patients again received subcutaneous abatacept , the immunogenicity rates 
were 1/38 (2.6%) in the group receiving subcutan eous abatacept  throughout, and 2/73 (2.7%) in the 
group that had received placebo during the withdrawal period. Upon reinitiating therapy, there were no 
injection reactions , and no differences in response to therapy in patients who were withdrawn from 
subcutaneous therapy for up to 3 months relative to those who remained on subcutaneous therapy, 
whether therapy was reintroduced with or without an intravenous loading dose. The safety observed in 
this study was consistent with that observed in the other studi es. 
1.1.5 Clinical Efficacy of Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation  
The clinical development program for SC abatacept  for rheumatoid arthritis  included 4 Phase 3b 
efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity studies (IM101167, IM101173, IM101174 and IM101185) plus 2 
clinical pharmacology studies (IM101013 and IM101063). Overall, the efficacy data from the SC 
abatacept development program demonstrated that the efficacy profile of SC abatacept is comparable to 
IV abatacept24. 
The key efficacy results were:  
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  21  The clinical efficacy of a fixed -dose of SC abatacept 125 mg weekly (following a single weight -
tiered IV loading dose on Day 1) was non -inferior to weight -tiered IV abatacept, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_863414] 20 at Day 169 (point estimates of 76.1% vs 75.7%, respectively). 
The non -inferiority margin ensured that SC abatacept maintained at least 70% of effectiveness of 
IV abatacept. The results from this study established that SC abatacept preserves at least 83% of 
the effect of IV abatacept (Study IM101174).  
 The magnitude of clinical response starting at Day 15 and up to 6 -months, across all pre -specified 
efficacy endpoints (ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70, DAS28 remission, LDAS) a nd physical function 
endpoint (HAQ) was comparable between SC abatacept and IV abatacept (Study IM101174).  
 Clinical efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_104706] 20 and HAQ response was similar between SC abatacept 
and IV abatacept within all weight subgroups, as well as al l other subgroups assessed (Study 
IM101174).  
 Clinical efficacy was maintained with LT administration of SC abatacept for up to 18 months 
(Studies IM101174, IM101173, IM101167, and IM101185).  
 Clinical efficacy achieved after either ST or LT IV abatacept th erapy was maintained upon switch 
to SC abatacept (Studies IM101174 LT and IM101185, respectively).  
 Based on reduction in DAS28 -CRP score over  time and at Day 85 (relative to baseline) in 2 
studies conducted in an open -label setting, the clinical efficacy of SC abatacept with or without 
IV loading dose appeared to be similar; indicating that the IV loading dose at Day 1 may not be 
essential for obtaining early onset of action (Studies IM101167 and IM101173, respectively).  
 The clinical efficacy of SC abatac ept also appears to be similar upon re -initiation of SC  abatacept 
with or without IV loading dose, based on reduction in DAS28 -CRP score over time (Study 
IM101167).   
1.2 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
This is a proof -of-concept phase 2 study to assess safety  and efficacy of abatacept in patients with dSSc . 
Systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma, SSc) is one of the most fatal rheumatic diseases, and is associated with 
substantial morbidity and many detrimental effects on health -related quality of life.  There are  no Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug s for SSc. Please see Section 1.6 for more details.  
1.3 Research Hypothesis  
SC abatacept is safe and shows evidence of efficacy in patients with dSSc  compared to matching 
placebo.  
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  22 1.4 Study Rationale  
1.4.1 Role of T c ells in the pathogenesis of SSc  
CD4+ T cells are central to the pathogenesis of a range of autoimmune diseases, both through their role 
in activating B cell differentiation and autoantibody production, and through secretion of cytokines.  T 
cell subsets ca n also protect against or attenuate autoimmunity through a variety of regulatory 
mechanisms. The CD4+ T cell population contains distinct subsets classified according to their program 
of cytokine secretion, such as the Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells, regulatory T  cells (Tregs), follicular -helper T 
cells, and additional subsets including bi -functional subsets that overlap between more than one Th 
population.  Activation of all subsets of CD4+ T cells requires delivery of at least 2 signals to the T cell, 
one throug h recognition of antigen -MHC and the second through co -stimulation, primarily by [CONTACT_863415]28 ligands B7.1 and B7.2 (CD80 and CD86) to CD28 on the T cell membrane.  
Substantial evidence supports the concept that T cells play a key role in the pathoge nesis of SSc, 
including cutaneous disease and at least some of the visceral complications. Skin biopsies obtained from 
SSc patients early in their disease demonstrate a perivascular, mononuclear cell infiltrate comprised of T 
cells and macrophages25-27. T cells are the dominant population of lymphocytes in the skin, and are 
activated26.  T cell infiltration correlate with the skin thi ckening, suggesting a relation between 
inflammation and fibrosis28. The expression of inducible costimulator (ICOS), expressed on activated T 
cells, is elevated in patients with early dcSSc29. T cells transferred from bleomycin -treated mice (a 
mouse model of SSc) to healthy animals induces skin thickening30. Also, the T lymphocytes in SSc 
tissue overexpress TNF receptor II and that these cells, when costimulated with TNF -α, trigger collagen 
production by [CONTACT_863416]31. 
Controversy and ambiguity  exists, however, regarding which Th subset may be pathogenic in SSc, with 
the focus largely on the Th2 and Th17 cells32, 33. Th2 cells,  defined by [CONTACT_93227] -4, have 
been implicated in SSc because some of their cytokine products, such as IL -13, are pro -fibrotic34-36. 
Moreover, Th2 cells are found in excess in the blood of patients with SSc, and in both cutaneous and 
pulmonary disease.  We showed that Th2 cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in SSc associated 
interstitial lung disease declined during treatment with imatinib37, 38.  Th1 mechanisms appear to be anti -
fibrotic32, 39. 
The more recently described Th17 subset is also expanded in SSc blood and skin, and has been 
suspected to be pathogenic40-44, although Th17 cytokines are not viewed as pro -fibrotic. One report 
suggests that Th22 cells, as well as Th2 and Th17, are expanded in patients with interstitial lung disease 
and SSc 45. Important new evidence suggests that although prevalent in SSc skin, the Th17 cells might 
actually be protective against skin fibrosis46.  Unlike IL -4+ cells, the IL -17A+ cells are in proximity to 
myofibroblasts in SSc skin, but in vitro IL -17A does not ind uce but rather inhibits myofibroblast 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  23 differentiation, and instead increases collagenase expression. An inverse correlation was found between 
the density of IL -17A+ cells and the extent of skin thickness.  
The genome -wide association studies in SSc47 have led to the  discovery of over 30 genes and gene 
regions, including both human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non -HLA genes, identifying as SSc 
susceptibility loci. Most of these genes are associated with lymphocyte activation and signaling (e.g. 
TNIP148), innate immunity (e.g. IRF849), transcription factors (e.g. STAT450) and cytokine receptors 
(e.g. IL2RA47). T cells from peripheral blood of women with SSc are activated, as judged by [CONTACT_46431] -
expression of CD40 -ligand due to DNA demethylati on51 and that the level of DNA methyl transferase 1 
is significantly decreased in patients with SSc52. Recently cytosine -phosphate -guanosine demethylation 
within the CD40L gene on the inactive X chromosome  has been documented to contribute to CD40L 
overexpression in CD4+ T lymphocytes from female SSc patients51 and could explain the female 
dominance in this condition.  
In summary, available data suggests that Th2 cells are pathogenic and Th17 cells protective in SSc32, 39. 
However, there are large knowledge gaps relat ed in part to small sample sizes of most prior studies, lack 
of longitudinal data (other than serial measurements of bronchoalveolar lavage T cells and IL -4-
producing cells in a small cohort of patients who received imatinib in an open label fashion for 
scleroderma lung disease38), limited data concurrently obtained from skin and blood, and lack of data 
prospec tively acquired during a clinical trial of an agent that is expected to affect T cells.  The study 
proposed is designed to address these gaps, and to shed light on the immunopathogenesis of SSc as well 
as on predictors of response to an immunomodulatory tr eatment.  
1.4.2 ABA in SSc  
The co -stimulatory molecules expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T cells represent a unique target for biologic 
activity in SSc. ABA is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human 
CTLA4 and a fragment (hinge - CH2 -CH3  domains) of the Fc domain of human IgG1 that has been 
modified to prevent complement fixation and antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity. ABA is the first 
drug in a new class of agents termed “selective costimulation modulators.” ABA is approved by [CONTACT_863417] (RA) and juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis. ABA binds specifically to the CD80 and CD86 molecules, proteins prominently displayed on 
the surface of antigen -presenting cells (APCs). Activati on of naive T cells during an immune response 
requires two stimuli from APCs. The first signal is antigen -specific; antigens are presented by [CONTACT_85804], 
with the signal transmitted to the T cell through the T cell’s antigen receptor. The second, or 
costimulator y, signal is not antigen -specific and is delivered following the engagement of a 
costimulatory ligand on the APC with a cognate receptor on the T cell.  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_863390] a large r placebo -controlled tria l with an emphasis on 
skin and blood biomarker53 (detailed in next section). Although ABA is well esta blished in the treatment 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  24 of RA, there is a striking dearth of data from human clinical trials regarding its mechanisms of action. 
There is evidence that pro -inflammatory cytokines are reduced by [CONTACT_863418]54  One study 
examined synovial tissue fro m 10 patients with RA who had responded to ABA + methotrexate, 
compared to [ADDRESS_1204043] not only T cell function, but also various functions of B7.1/2(CD80/86)+ cells is 
supported by a study of monocytes from RA blood before and after treatment with ABA: after treatment 
monocytes accumulated in the blood and had reduced adhesive and migratory capacity56.  Similar effects 
were seen with in vitro exposure of normal human monocytes to CTLA4 -Ig.  Although synovial tissue 
was not evaluated in this study the findings imply that decreased ingress of monocytes into inflamed 
synovium is one of the therapeutic mechanis ms of ABA, and raise the possibility that in SSc ABA could 
reduce monocyte ingress into lesional skin. In addition, ABA reduces the antigen -induced expression of 
ICOS in a murine model of arthritis57_ENREF_9  and inhibits antigen s pecific T cell proliferation and 
activation. ABA also strikingly inhibits antigen stimulated T cell secretion of IFNg, IL -[ADDRESS_1204044] APCs through its binding to CD80/86, 
upregulating indoleamine 2,3 -dioxygenase (IDO). Although a role for ABA in dendritic cells 
(DC)/macrophage phenotype was not supported by [CONTACT_863419] -stimulated APC subsets27, only purified APCs were tested in these studies. More 
recent studies have suggested that the effect of ABA on DCs might be indirect, mediated by [CONTACT_485] -[ADDRESS_1204045] of blockade of T cell co -stimulation with 
intravenous abatacept in patients with dSSc.  Ten patients were randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_1204046] non-Raynaud’s manifestation was 4.4 ( SD 3.8) years. 7 patients were randomized to receive 
abatacept and 3 received placebo.  At baseline, there were no significant differences in mRSS, Health 
Assessment Questionnaire -Disability Index (HAQ -DI), patient and physician global assessments by 
[CONTACT_116098] (VAS) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) between the two groups, although 
participant s randomized to abatacept had shorter disease duration (2.4 vs. 8.8 years, p=0.004).  
Compared with those receiving placebo, participant s treated with abatacept reported greater 
improvement in patient global assessment by [CONTACT_8298] ( -8 vs. -2.7, p=0.023).  Subjects receiving abatacept 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  25 had a mean improvement of 8.6 (SD 7.5) in mRSS at week 24, which exceeds the minimal clinica l 
important  difference of 5.360. Patients receiving abatacept had a greater improvement in absolute mRSS 
compared with those receiving placebo, but this did not reach statistical significance given the small 
sample s ize (-8.6 vs -2.3, p=0.059).   No deaths or serious adverse events related to abatacept occurred 
and overall the study drug was well -tolerated. This study was limited by [CONTACT_863420], the latter fact implying that any 
differences between the two groups might be explained by [CONTACT_863421].   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_141859], our preliminary data support a potential role for abatacept in the treatment of 
cutaneous sclerosis in SSc.  Therefore, we aim to perform a phase 2 , multi -center double -blind 
randomized controlled trial of subcutaneous abatacept vs. placebo in patients with early diffuse 
cutaneous SSc.

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1 Study Design and Duration  
This study is a randomized placebo -controlled double -blind phase 2 trial of patients with dcSSc.  
Eligible participant s will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 125 mg SC abatacept  or matching 
placebo , stratified by [CONTACT_863429] ( <18 months vs > 18 to <36 months) .  Study 
participant s will be treated for [ADDRESS_1204049] whether abat acept is statistically superior 
to placebo in reducing  the m RSS at  month 12  and explore  the ability of aba tacept to prevent or reverse 
progression  in patients with ea rly disease duration and lower m RSS scores , and reverse established 
disease in patients with longer disease duration and higher MRSS  scores . 
The schema below describes the ma in elements of the study design:

Escape Therapy  
Starting at  Month 6 , patients with worsening of skin disease (defined as > 5 units  worsening of mRSS) 
have the opportunity to add escape therapy  to their randomized study medication ( weekly a batacept  or 
placebo SC). In addition, worsening of ILD as defined by [CONTACT_863430]% predicted by ≥ 10% 
or absolute decline in DLCO% predicted by ≥ 15 (confirmed by [CONTACT_863431] 1 month) have the opportunity to add escape therapy .  Other indica tions include: active 
inflammatory polyarthritis or inflammatory myositis. The decision to initiate escape therapy is based on 
investigator discretion in eligible participant s. This may include methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, 
cyclophosphamide, hydroxychloroquine , azathioprine or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) .  This may 
not include other biologic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .

4.2.3 Reproductive Status  
Definition of Women of Child -Bearing Potential (WOCBP). WOCBP comprises women who have 
experienced menarche and who have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, 
bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral o ophorectomy) or who are not post -menopausal. WOCBP therefore 
includes women using the following methods to prevent pregnancy: Oral contraceptives, other hormonal 
contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mecha nical 
products such as intrauterine devices or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides); women 
who are practicing abstinence; and women who have a partner who is sterile (e.g., due to vasectomy).  
The following women are defined as post -menopausal:  
• Women who have had amenorrhea for  12 consecutive months (without another cause)  
• Women who have irregular menstrual periods and a documen ted serum FSH level 
> 35 mIU/mL as part of her medical history.  
• Women who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HR T). 
WOCBP must be using an acceptable method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study 
and for [ADDRESS_1204057] ed below.  
 
 Hormonal methods: combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal); progestogen -only 
hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable)  
 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  33  Barrier and mechanical methods: intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone -releasing 
system (IUS), male or female condom with or without spermicide; cap, diaphragm or sponge 
with spermicide  
 
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 
 Vasectomised partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial 
participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical 
success of the vasectomy)  
 
 True abstinence (where abstinence is a life style choice made by [CONTACT_863433])  
 
Periodic abstinence (for example, calendar, ovulation, symptom -thermal and post ovulation methods), 
abstinence for the duration of the trial and the withdrawal method are not con sidered acceptable forms of 
contraception.  
WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test result (minimum sensitivity 25  IU/L or 
equivalent units of HCG) within [ADDRESS_1204058] (and non -investigational product at the discretion of 
the investigator) for any of the following reasons:  
 Withdrawal of informed consent ( participant ’s decision to withdra w for any reason) . 
 Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality , or intercurrent illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046], indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the 
participant . 
 Pregnancy  
 Instruct WOCBP to contact [CONTACT_863434] ( e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study 
participation. Institutional policy and local regulations should determi ne the frequency of 
on-study pregnancy tests for WOCBP enrolled in the study.  
 Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary incarceration  for 
treatment of either a psychiatric or physical ( e.g., infectious disease) illness . 
 Anaphlaxis or serious allergic reaction

5.1.2 Handling  and Dispensing  
 The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. The 
investigator is responsibl e for ensuring  that it is dispensed only to study participant s and only 
from  official study sites by [CONTACT_4144] , as dictated by [CONTACT_427].  
 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the investigational product is stored under the 
appropriate environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity), as d escribed below : 
 Abatacept SC formulations (prefilled syringes) and corresponding placebo should be stored 
under refrigeration (approximately 2 to 8°C) and protected from long -term (more than 24 hours) 
exposure to light. Do not freeze.  
 Abatacept injection, 125 mg/syringe (125 mg/mL) and placebo for SC administration are ready 
to use solutions provided in pre -filled siliconized syringes with a 29 gauge needle.  
 Care should be taken when handling the injectable drug products that are used in this protocol. 
Proper aseptic techniques must be used when preparing and administering sterile parenteral 
products such as abatacept. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate 
matter prior to administration. Refer to the Pack age Insert  for additional information regarding 
handling, preparation, and storage of abatacept.  
 If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the investigational product arise, do not 
dispense the investigational product , and contact [CONTACT_863435]. 
5.[ADDRESS_1204061] been met.  At the  time of randomization, 
patients will be assigned a unique randomization number; no participant  may begin treatment 
prior to randomization.  Eligible participant s will be randomized to abatacept or placebo in a 1:1 
manner, stratified by [CONTACT_863436] ( <18 months vs >18 to <36 months).  The DCC will 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  36 prepare the randomization schedule, using computer -generated block randomization  with the 
block size(s) known only by [CONTACT_15791] .  A secure web -based application will be built that will be 
used by [CONTACT_863437] (e.g., participant  ID, stratification 
factor(s)) and to obtain the randomization number.  The information can be printed and sent 
and/or emailed directly to the site pharmacists.  
5.[ADDRESS_1204062]  
The recommended dosage is 125 mg/mL single -dose prefilled glass syr inge for subcutaneous injection. 
The injection can be given in front of the thighs, abdomen (except for the 2 inch area around the navel), 
or the outer area of the upper arms. Arms should be performed by [CONTACT_863438]. The medication will be given on weekly basis for a period of 12 months .  
For a SAE , the dose may  be interrupted until the SAE is resolved. The decision to restart the 
investigational drug after an SAE will be local investigat or responsibility. For other AEs, the 
investigator will decide on the appropriate action .  
5.5 Blinding/Unblinding  
 This is a double -blind study.  The study staff (except for select staff at the Data Coordinating 
Center ) and the patient are blinded to the treat ment assignment.  
 Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the event of a medical 
emergency or pregnancy in a participant , in which knowledge of the investigational product  is 
critical to the participant 's management , the blind for that participant  may be broken .  
 Before breaking the b lind of an individual participant ’s treatment , the investigator should have 
determined that the information is necessary , i.e., that it will alter the participant ’s immediate 
management.  A discuss ion with the protocol chairs  is encouraged  prior to proceeding with 
unblinding. The investigator holds sole responsibility for the decision to unblind in case of 
emergency.  In many cases, particularly when the emergency is not investigational product -
related, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_863439].  
5.[ADDRESS_1204063] a 
stable dose of prednisone or equivalent (<=10 mg/day) and non -steroidal anti -inflammatory agents to 
enter the study the dosage may change after the baseline visit as the local investigator determines. 
Prohibited and /or Restricted T reatments  
Concurrent administration of a TNF antagonist with  abatacept  has been associated with an increased risk 
of serious infections and no significant additional efficacy over use of the TNF antagonists alone. 
Concurrent therapy with abatacept  and TNF antagonists is not recommended.  
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
[ADDRESS_1204064] occurred in patients on 
concomitant immunosuppressive therapy which in addit ion to their underlying disease  could further 
predispose them to infection. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of abatacept  
in patients with a history of recurrent infections, underlying conditions which may predispose them to 
infections, or chronic, latent, or localized infections. Patients who develop a new infection while 
undergoing treatment with abatacept should be monitored closely. Administration of abatacept should be 
discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. For additional information, see Warnings and 
Precautions section  5.1 of the package insert ( Appendix I).  
From Abatacept Package Insert (section 5.1):  
Concomitant Use with TNF Antagonists  
In controlled clinical trials in patients with adult RA, patients receiving concomitant ORENCIA and 
TNF antagonist therapy experienced more infections (63%) and serious infections (4.4%) compared to 
patients treated with only TNF antagonists (43% and 0.8%, respectively) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) 
from package insert].  These trials failed to demonstrate an important enhancement of efficacy with 
concomitant administration of ORENCIA with TNF antagonist; therefore, concurrent therapy with 
ORENCIA and a TNF antagonist is not recommended.  While transitioning from TNF antag onist 
therapy to ORENCIA therapy, patients should be monitored for signs of infection.

Efficacy Assessments  
6.4 Efficacy Assessment s 
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessments  
The Modified Rodnan skin score  is a validated physical examination method for estimating skin 
induration. It is correlated with biopsy measures of skin thickness and reflects prognosis and visceral 
involvem ent, especially in early disease2, 4. It is scored on a 0 (normal) to 3+ (severe induration) ordinal 
scales over 17 body areas, with a maximum score of 51 and is used to categorize severity of SSc. It has 
been exte nsively used as primary/ secondary outcome in RCTs65-67.  This will be collected at  every study 
visit.  
6.4.2  Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
 28-Tender joint count: Investigator will assess tenderness of the joints and score th em as 
positive or negative. The joints include: proximal interphalangeal joints, metacarpophalangeal 
joints, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees. Performed at every visit.  
 28-Swollen joint count:  Investigator will assess swelling of the joints and score t hem as positive 
or negative. The joints include: proximal interphalangeal joints, metacarpophalangeal joints, 
wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees.  Performed at every visit.  
 Patient global assessment for overall disease : This assessment represents the pat ient’s 
assessment of the patient’s global scleroderma on a 0 -10 Likert  scale . “On a scale of [ADDRESS_1204072] week? 0=Excellent; 10=Extremely Poor . Assessed at baseline 
and months 3, 6, 12 and 18 . 
 Physician global assessment for overall disease:  This assessment represents the physician’s 
assessment of the patient’s c urrent disease activity on a 0-10 Likert  scale . “On a scale of 0 -10,

Assessed at baseline and months 3, 6, 12 and 18 .PROMIS -29 Profile v 2.0 measure:  The 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS®) Roadmap initiative  (www.nihpromise.org ) is a cooperative research 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  44 program designed to develop, evaluate, and standardize item banks to measure patient -reported 
outcomes (PROs) across different medical conditions as well as the US population . PROMIS -[ADDRESS_1204073] of cyclophosphamide vs. mycophenolate mofetil in SSc -associated interstitial lung 
disease (SSc -ILD).   Assessed at baseline and months 3, 6, 12 and 18 . 
 SHAQ -DI: The SHAQ -DI is a disease -targeted, musculoskeletal -targeted measure intended for 
assessing functional ability in arthritis . It is a self -administered 20 -question instrument that 
assesses a patient’s level of functional ability and includes questions that involve both upper and 
lower extremities. The SHAQ -DI score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (severe disability). It 
has a  7 day recall period and has been extensively used in SSc65, 67. 5 visual analog scales are 
included   in the scleroderma -HAQ assessing burden of digital ulcers, Raynaud’s, gastrointestinal 
involvement, breathing, and overall disease 68. Assessed at baseline and months 3, 6, 12 and 18.  
 PROMIS Fatigue measure:  Apart from assessing the PROMIS -29 measure that assesses 
overall HRQOL, we will assess fatigue as it is one of the commo n symptoms of patients with 
SSc. We will administer 8 -item short form with 1 -week recall (available at www.nihpromis.org).   
Assessed at baseline and months 3, 6, 12 and 18 . 
 PROMIS sleep disturbance and sleep impairment measures:  Sleep distu rbances are rated as 
the one of the top compla ints from the patients with SSc and will be assessed using 8 -items each 
with 1 week recall.  (available  at www.nihpromis.org ).  Assessed at baseline and months 3, 6, 12 
and 18 . 
 UCLA SCTC GIT 2. 0: This validated instrument assess es scleroderma -related gastrointestinal 
symptoms.  It has 7 scales and a final composite score http://uclascleroderma.researchcore.org.  
Assessed at baseline  and months  3, 6, 12 and 18.   
 Combined Re sponse Index in Systemic Sclerosis (CRISS) : CRISS is a  composite measure for 
early dcSSc. It is determined in a 2-step process that assess es the probability of deterioration 
(step 1) and of improvement (step 2), where each probability ranges from 0.[ADDRESS_1204074] 
step assesses whether the patient has had a significant decline in renal or cardiopulmonary 
involvement. The second step asses ses the probability of improvement by [CONTACT_863444], percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), patient and 
physician global assessments, and SHAQ -DI over 1 year .   Assessed at 6 and 12 months.  
 Percent predicted FVC:  Assessed  at Screening and  months 6, 12 and 18 .

 Patient interference with the s kin involvem ent in the past month on a [ADDRESS_1204075] month how much has your skin involvement interfered with your daily 
activities? 0=Does not limit activity; 10= Very severe limitation . This will be assessed at 
baseline and month 3, 6,  12 and 18 . 
 Cardiac involvement at 12 months:  New/worsened clinically significant heart disease 
consi dered secondary SSc, including any of the following: heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
new onset pulmonary hypertension requiring specific treatment, pericardial disease requiring 
intervention or clinical decompensation, and arrhythmias and/or condu ction defects requiring 
treatment ). 
 New renal crisis at 12 months . 
 Percent predicted DLCO, corrected for hemoglobin . Assessed  at months 6, 12, and 18 . 
The equation used for adjusting predicted DLCO from hemoglobin  is as follows:  
 
For adult males, the equation  (expressing Hb in g m•dL-1) is:   
DL,CO,predicted  × (1.7Hb  / (10.22+Hb))  
In adult women , the equation is:  
DL,CO,predicted  × (1.7Hb  / (9.38+Hb))  
 
 Change from baseline in bo dy mass index at 12 months . 
 Digital ulcer  net burden  as assessed by [CONTACT_863426] (after 
randomization to 12 months) :  Digital ulcer net burden is defined as t he number of overall 
digital ulcers as assessed by [CONTACT_093]. A digital ulcer is defined as an ulcer at or distal to 
the metacarpo phalangeal joint with loss of surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_118854]. This does not include 
fissures, cracks or calcium extrusion from calcinosis cutis.  
 Pain intensity due to S Sc over the past week on a 0 -150 mm VAS  assessed at baseline, and 3, 6, 
12 and 18  months. 
6.4.4 Validation of new PRO for Scleroderma -related Skin Symptoms  (PRO -SRSS)  
Based on findings from a literature review, qualitative focus groups, and consultation with clinical experts, the 
PRO for Scleroderma -related Skin Symptoms instrument was developed  to assess scleroderma -related skin 
thickening among patients with scleroderma. The instrument focuses on seven skin symptoms: skin tightness, skin 
thickening, skin sensitivity, skin color, itchiness, pain from skin tightness, and skin puffiness; the basel ine version 
has an additional symptom, skin ulcers. The instrument also assesses limitation to motion of various body parts 
and has several global items.  In the initial assessment , there is a total of 22 items (8 symptom items; 13 limitation 
in motion ite ms; 1 global severity item), and follow -up version includes 22 items (7 symptom items; 13 limitation 
in motion items; 1 global severity; and 1 global rating of change in skin symptoms).  The PRO -SRSS has a 7 -day 
recall.  The PRO -SRSS will be administered a t baseline and at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 month visits.

7 ADVERSE EVEN T REPORTING  
7.1 Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event  (AE)  is defined as  
 Any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre -existing medical condition in a 
patient or clinical investigation participant  administered an investigational ( medicinal ) product 
and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example) , 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or 
not con sidered related to the  investigational product.  
 Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or e valuation of a participant . (In order to prevent reporting bias, participant s 
should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
7.1.1 Serious Adverse Event s 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose :  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant  was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)  
 Requires inpatie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see note 
below for exceptions)  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a cong enital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based on appropriate medical and scientific 
judgment, may jeopardize the participant  or may require intervention ( e.g., medical, surgical) to 
prevent one of the other s erious outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include but are 
not limited to intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Potential 
drug induced liver injury (DILI) i s also considered an important medical event (see Section 7.6 
for the definition of potential DILI).  
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  47  Suspected transmission of an infectious agent ( e.g., any organism, virus or infectious particle, 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic ) via the study drug is an SAE.  
If any SAE occurs the investigator will report it to the Sponsor  (via DCC)  within [ADDRESS_1204076] be handled as SAEs (See Section  7.5 for reporting pregnancies).  
NOTE:  The following h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_863395] : 
 A visit t o the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8610] 24 hours that 
does not result in admission (unless considered an “ important medi cal event ” or a 
life-threatening  event ) 
 Elective surgery planned before  signing consent  
 Admissions as per protocol for a pla nned medical/surgical procedure  
 Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health s tatus ( e.g., 
routine colonoscopy)  
 Medical/surgical  admission for purpose other tha n remedying ill health state that  was planned  
before study entry.  Appropriate documenta tion is required in these cases . 
 Admission  encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention ( e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequac y, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative) . 
7.1.2 Non-serious Adverse Event s 
Non-serious adverse events are all adverse events that are not classified as SAEs . 
7.1.3 Assignment of Adverse Event Intensity and Relationship to Abatacept  
All adverse events, including those that are serious, will be graded by [CONTACT_3470]:  
 
 Mild  (Grade 1): awareness of event but easily tolerated  
 Moderate  (Grade 2): discomfort enough to cause some interference with usual activity  
 Severe  (Grade 3): inabili ty to carry out usual activity  
 Very  Severe (Grade 4): debilitating; significantly incapacitates participant  despi[INVESTIGATOR_296857].  
 Death (Grade 5): Death related to AE  
 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
[ADDRESS_1204077] as determined 
by a physician should be used:  
 Related:  There is a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product administration 
and the adverse event.  
 Not Related:  There is not a reasonable causal relationship between  the investigation al 
product administration and the adverse event.  
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are facts ( e.g., 
evidence such as de -challenge/re -challenge) or other arguments to suggest a positive causal relations hip. 
7.2 Collection  and Reporting  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, examination, 
or evaluation of a participant . To prevent reporting bias,  participant s should not be questioned regarding 
the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events . 
If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than its 
individual symptoms. The following information should be captured fo r all AEs: onset, duration, 
intensity,  seriousness, relationship to  investigational product , action taken , and treatment r equired. If 
treatment for the event  was administered, it should be recorded in the medical record.   
7.2.1 Serious Adverse Event  Collecting and Reporting  
Following the participant ’s written consent to participate in the study, all AE/SAEs , whether related or 
not related to study drug,  must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -
specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur within  [ADDRESS_1204078] be collected that relate to any later protocol -specified procedure ( e.g., a follow -
up skin biopsy).  
The investigator should report  any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related 
to study drug or protocol -specified procedure . 
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of seriousness . 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, or a complication of a study procedu re), 
the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
 
7.2.2 Non-Serious Adverse Events  (NSAEs)  Collecting and Reporting  
The collection of non -serious adverse event (NSAE)  information should begin at initiation of study 
drug. N SAE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in period or other 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
[ADDRESS_1204079] results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported  as such.  
The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately : 
 Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or  meets the definition of an SAE  
 any laboratory abnormality that required the participant  to have s tudy drug discontinued or 
interrupted  
 any laboratory abnormality that required the participant  to receive specific corrective therapy.  
Because some drugs have the potential for drug -related laboratory abnormalities, consider adding 
language specifying whic h laboratory parameters require follow up and for how long (eg, until 
stabilization or resolution).  
It is expected that whenever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory, term would be used by [CONTACT_35867] (eg, anemia vs low hemoglo bin value).   
7.[ADDRESS_1204080] will be 
permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner ( e.g., dose tapering if necessary for participant  
safety). Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
participant  unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] ( e.g., x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.   
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  50 7.6 Potential Drug -Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -relate d laboratory abnormalities should occur 
prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined 
criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 7.2.1  for reporting details).  
Potential drug induced liver inj ury is defined as :  
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) , and  
2. Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1204081], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),  and 
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT e levation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
7.7 Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening  noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, x-
rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by [CONTACT_12695], should also be recorded as a non -serious or serious AE, as appropria te, and reported 
accordingly.  
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Sample Size Considerations :  
Previous randomized controlled studies in early dcSSc provide the basis for us to characterize the 
magnitude of treatment differences we could detect with sample sizes of  74-86 participants with a two -
sided Type I error of 5%, 80% power, and a drop -out rate of 15%.  The phase [ADDRESS_1204082] deviation (SD) of the change in mRSS is approximately 7 points.   We conservatively selected a 
larger estimate of the SD for our sample size calculations.  
This phase 2 study is primarily sized based on practical considerations, rather than a desired power for a 
pre-specified difference.  We plan to screen approximatel y 121 participants in order to  randomize 86 
participants to achieve 74 analyzable participants  (assuming a 15% attrition rate) .  With the proposed 
sample of 74 participants in the study ( 37 per treatment group), there is at least 80% power to detect a 
24% treatment difference in proportions of participants with adverse events with a two -sided Type I 
error of 5% and a placebo rate of 70% (two -sample test of binomial proportions, East 5.4).  F or 
continuous outcomes, there is at least 80% power to detect an effect size of at least 0.66 with a two -
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  51 sided Type I error of 5% with this sample size (two -sample t test, East 5.4).  This effect size (treatment 
difference / pooled SD) translates into a tr eatment difference in change from baseline to month 12 in 
mRSS of 5.3 with a SD of 8 points.   If the pooled SD or drop -out rate is smaller, then the given sample 
size would allow for smaller treatment differences to be detected with the same power.  
8.2 Analyse s 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be written for the study, and finalized prior to unblinding of the 
data, that contains more detailed and complete descriptions of the analyses to be performed.   
8.2.1 Analysis Populations  
Several analysis sets will be us ed in the analyses of the data:  
• Safety Population.  The Safety Population is defined as all participants who are randomized and 
receive at least one dose of study drug.  The Safety Population will be used for all safety analyses.  
Subjects will be analyz ed by [CONTACT_83352].  
• Efficacy Populations.  The main analysis set for efficacy will be the mITT population, defined as 
all participants randomized, receiving at least one dose of study medication, and having at least one 
post-baseline efficacy a ssessment.  Subjects will be analyzed by [CONTACT_220261].  Membership in the 
analysis populations will be determined before study unblinding.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_1204083] udy to assess the pattern of response over time for 
key variables and to assess the relationships among variables.  
We will summarize the extent of missing data over time for the primary endpoint.  We will investigate 
the missing data mechanism (missing at random, not missing at random), which is important for the 
validity of our analytic approaches, through exploratory analysis. Exploratory analyses will include plots 
of the mean profile of mRSS at months 0, 3, 6, [ADDRESS_1204084] 
complete data throughout the study and those who don’t, as well as plots of the mean change from 
baseline at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 in mRSS in the two treatments within each group (completers and 
non-completers). If the plots reveal consistent differen ces between completers and non -completers 
within each of the treatment groups, then there is evidence that data are not missing at random.  
If data are missing at random, in the secondary analysis for the primary endpoint, we may fit a linear 
mixed mo del wi thin a Bayesian framework .  In a Bayesian framework, missing data is treated as an 
additional model parameter to be estimated during model fitting. Missing values are estimated through 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
[ADDRESS_1204085] current estimates of the remaining model parameters. If data are not missing at random, the 
analysis will be expanded to include a model for missing data mechanism using a binary variable 
indicating whether an observation  is missing or not.  The complete data model will include the linear 
mixed model and a logistic regression model linking the probability that an observation is missing to 
some variables we believe are important in explaining the likelihood of a missing obs ervation (for 
example, in our case, pain or mRSS at previous time point).  
Sensitivity analyses will be carried out to assess the robustness of our conclusions to approaches to deal 
with missing data.  
Two-sided p -values will be reported, and no adjustments for multiplicity will be made.  Thus, p -values 
for secondary and exploratory outcomes will be interpreted with caution.  
8.2.3 Safety Analyses  
Descriptive summary statistics for adverse and serious adverse events will be reported.  Adverse events 
will be grouped by [CONTACT_863445]; serious 
adverse events will be enumerated and described as appropriate. The total number of adverse events of 
each grade occurring in the two treatment groups by [CONTACT_24473] 12 will be co mpared using a Fisher’s exact 
test. Poisson regression or comparable non -parametric methods will be used to compare the total number 
of serious adverse events during the double -blind 12 -month period by [CONTACT_1570].  For laboratory 
and other safety para meters that are continuous, two -sample t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be 
performed to compare the two treatment groups.  
8.2.4 Efficacy Analyses  
Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to month  12 in mRSS scores.  For the 
primary analysis, changes in mRSS scores from baseline to month 12 will be compared in the two 
treatment groups using an ANCOVA model with terms for treatment group, duration of dcSSc disease 
(stratification factor) and baselin e mRSS score.  If the assumptions of this parametric model are not met, 
an alternative non -parametric model will be used.  Given that the incorporation of escape therapy after 
month [ADDRESS_1204086] of this approach.  
Additional analyses of mRSS will be conducted to understand the time cours e of study treatment, and 
escape therapy, on mRSS.  We will analyze mRSS data at months 0 (baseline), 3, 6, [ADDRESS_1204087] of time -in-study (expressed as a fraction of a year), the 
interaction between tim e-in-study and treatment, duration of dcSSc disease (stratification factor), and 
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  53 patient specific random effects to account for both heterogeneity among patients and correlation among 
measurements taken on the same participant. To account for the possibili ty of escape therapy, we will 
define an additional variable that indicates whether a patient initiated escape therapy and if so, the time 
(after month 3) the escape therapy was added to the patient’s randomized study medication. The model 
will account for escape therapy by [INVESTIGATOR_3086], at the time points following the beginning of the patient’s 
escape therapy, an additional interaction term between treatment, escape therapy and time -in-study 
minus time -since -escape -therapy (both expressed as fraction of a yea r). To test whether there is a 
significant difference in the way mRSS changes over time between the two groups, we will simply test 
whether the interaction term between treatment and time -in-study is significantly different from zero.  
If mRSS does not chan ge linearly as a function of time -in-study, we will extend the linear mixed model 
to include: a polynomial of time -in-study (expressed a fraction of a year) of an appropriate degree, the 
interaction between treatment and the polynomial of time -in-study, du ration of dcSSc disease 
(stratification factor), patient specific random effects, and for time points following the beginning of the 
escape therapy, the interaction between treatment, escape therapy and the polynomial of time -in-study 
minus time -since -escape-therapy (both expressed as fractions of a year). In this case, to test whether 
there is a significant difference between the two groups in the way mRSS changes over time, we will 
simply test whether any of the coefficients in the interaction between tre atment and the polynomial of 
time-in-study is significantly different from zero.  Given the limited sample size of this phase [ADDRESS_1204088] analysis, we will compare the change in each secondary outcome measure 
from baseline to month 12 between the two treatment groups using an ANCOVA m odel or its non -
parametric counterpart if the model assumptions aren’t met.  For critical secondary outcomes, a 
longitudinal model (generalized linear mixed model) comparable to that for the primary endpoint will be 
fit.   
Analyses of Exploratory Outcomes.  
Graphical methods will be used to explore the distributions of exploratory outcomes by [CONTACT_1570], 
and the inter -relationships among the exploratory outcomes and other efficacy outcomes.  Generalized 
linear models will be fit to more formally assess the impact of treatment on the exploratory outcomes, 
adjusting for the duration of dcScc (the stratification factor) and other important covariates.  Non -
parametric methods will be used if distributional assumptions are not met.   
Analyses of Ancillary Obj ective.  
 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Formulation ISR Protocol   
8 December  2015  54 Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the change from baseline in the PRO -SRSS  at months 3, 6, 
9 and 12.  Statistical models will be built to assess the relationship between this new PRO with other clinical and 
QOL measures in the study to validate its utility in the clinical trials arena.

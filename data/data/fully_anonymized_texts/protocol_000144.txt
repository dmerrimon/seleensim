PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
Title:     PE-PC Pi[INVESTIGATOR_437256]:  A study to evaluate the delivery and sustainability of a brief trauma- focused treatment, 
Prolonged Exposure for Primary Care (PE -PC), an evidence -based intervention for PTSD, 
delivered via telehealth to patients  in Community Health Centers (CHCs) in Michigan . 
 Outcomes:  Primary Outcome: PE-PC participants will experience  reductions in  PTSD symptoms as 
measured by [CONTACT_437258] -5 (PCL -5) at 2 months and 4 months . 
 
 Secondary Outcome s: PE-PC participants will experience reductions in depr ession as 
measured by [CONTACT_127659] -9 at 2 months and 4 months . We will also e xamine the mechanisms 
of PE -PC’s effect by [CONTACT_437259] , 
recovery goals (Recovery Assessment Scale; RAS)  and p osttraumatic cognitions ( Post -
Traumatic Cognitions Inventory ; PTCI) .  
 
Intervention  Information:   Deliver PE -PC to patients via telehealth . This treatment consists of four 30 -minute sessions 
of in -vivo and narrative exposure, with content drawn from the PE model .

1  BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
 
1.1  Background  
 
Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is a disorder that  develop s following exposure to traumatic events  such as 
rape, assault, natural disaster, or combat. It is associated with distress, impairment, and greater risk for adverse health outcomes, including am ong Michigan Medicaid enrollees.
2 The percentage of patients screening positive for 
PTSD in primary care settings  has been estimated to range from  14% -23%.3-[ADDRESS_554040] directly addresses 
the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Mental Health and Wellness commission priority 
to provide “better access to high quality, coordinated and consiste nt service and care between agencies, service 
providers and across geographical boundaries.”  
 
The project goals are to evaluate the delivery and sustainability of a brief trauma -focused treatment, Prolonged 
Exposure for Primary Care (PE -PC), an evidence -based intervention for PTSD, when delivered via telehealth to  
patients enrolled at CHCs  in Michigan. CHC s serve 680,[ADDRESS_554041] for DSM -5 (PCL -5). 
PCL-[ADDRESS_554042] -enrollment  (around the time of treatment completion) and 
4-months post - enrollment . Two 2 -month and 4 -month surveys will be administered regardless of whether the 
patient has completed the intervention.  
 
1. PCL-5 [Time  Frame:  Baseline, 2-month s, 4-months ] 
The PCL-511 is a 20 -item self -report measure designed to assess P TSD symptoms as defined by [CONTACT_9288] -
5. Each item of the PCL -5 is scored on a five point scale ranging from 0 ( “not at all”) to 4 (“extremely ”). 
The PCL -[ADDRESS_554043] reliability, and convergent and discriminant 
validity .12,13 Scores ≥ 33 indicate a probable diagnosis of PTSD.  
 
2.2  Secondary Outcomes  
 
1. Depressive symptoms  (measured by [CONTACT_199005]; PHQ -9)14,15 [Time  Frame:  Baseline, 2 -
months, 4 -months ] 
2. Recovery goals (measured by [CONTACT_437260]; RAS )16,17 [Time  Frame:  Baseline, 2 -months, 4 -
months ]  
3. Posttraumatic cognitions (measured by [CONTACT_112747]- Traumatic Cognitions Inventory; PTCI)18 
[Time  Frame:  Baseline, 2-months, 4 -months ]  
 
[ADDRESS_554044] is to deliver PE -PC to 50 patients via telehealth and evaluate patients’ engagement 
with the treatment, satisfaction, and PTSD -related outcomes.  This is an open trial. All participants will receive the 
same intervention.  
 
[ADDRESS_554045] is individuals with PTSD who receive services from CHCs in Michigan.  
 
4.1  Inclusion Criteria  
The goal of the study inclusion and exclusion criteria is to identify a broadly representativ e sample of CHC patients 
with PTSD .  
 
Patients will be eligible for the study if they : 
1) are age 18 years or older  
2) receiv e care at a Michigan CHC  
3) have a PCL -5 score ≥33  
4) have had psychotropic medication stability for at least 4 weeks  
 
4.2  Exclusion Criteria  
Patients will be excluded if they are: 1) substantially cognitively impaired, 2) unable to agree to study procedures  
for any reason (including incompetency), 3 ) at high  risk of suicide , or 4) current ly engage d in a trauma-focused 
behavio ral treatment  (such as Prolonged Exposure or Cognitive Processing Therapy) . Patients who do not speak 
English will be excluded for logistical reasons . 
 
4.3  Recruitment  
Participants will be recruited from the following CHCs: Family Medical Center of Michigan, Hamilton 
Community Health Network , and Family Health Care . All three clinics are all currently engaged in University of 
Michigan research studies and strongly endorse the current study.   
 
[ADDRESS_554046] established a PE -PC training protocol that  includes 
didactic training followed by [CONTACT_437261]. Trainers will augment this training with case review to establish competence.  
 
5.3 Delivery of Treatment  
 
Eligible participants are individuals presenting in CHC s who screen positive for PTSD, using validated screening 
measures currently used in multiple Michigan CHC s. Those who screen positive will be connected by a warm 
handoff to the research assistant  (or will call us after being provided with our contact [CONTACT_3031]) , who will 
review inclusion/exclusion criteria, present the study information sheet , and schedule the first meeting with the 
telepsychologist. 
 
PE-PC treatment will follow the PE -PC manual and patient workbook.  Treatment content for PE- PC is drawn 
from the PE model a nd condensed so as to deliver the most efficacious components of PE. PE -PC consists of four, 
30-minute appointments scheduled approximately once a week over 4 -6 weeks (to accommodate scheduling and 
missed appointments). Before beginning the [ADDRESS_554047] PE -PC session, the PC -MHI provider will review the “Confronting Uncomfortable Memo ries” 
activity workbook to be completed at home and brought back for use in subsequent sessions. The workbook asks 
the patient to write a detailed first-person narrative of the event associated with the greatest level of current distress, including recollection of personal thoughts, feelings, and physical reactions. Emotional processing questions are also included. In addition, the telepsychologist will plan for in -vivo exposure activities between 
sessions. The patient will be instructed to complete the mem ory exposure for [ADDRESS_554048] will review the patient’s exposures, problem -solve any 
implementation difficulties, and process the exercises. The patient will then read the narrative and his or her 
answers to the emotional processing questions out loud and they will process the exercise. Practice continues between sessions. This session format and content are repeated at the third and fourth sessions. At the end of the fourth session,  the telepsychologist and patient will review treatment progress assisted by [CONTACT_437262] -5 (PCL -5) administered during the fourth session. Participants who still need or desire treatment 
at the conclusion of PE -PC will receive referrals to other mental health resources.   
 
[ADDRESS_554049] errors were adjusted for the variability between imputations according to Rubin’s combination rule .
19 
We i ncluded auxiliary variables that were correlated with the missing variables at r > 0.4 .20 Imputation procedures 
were conducted in SAS, using the Ma rkov Chain Monte Carlo approach.

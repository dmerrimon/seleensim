Research question :  Comparing time to intubate  (TTI)  with/without intubation 
barrier box in study group vs control group when used with video laryngoscopy  
(glidescope ) during for anesthetic induction.  
 
 
 
Setting of the Human Research  
This study will take place in the operating room at the Robert Packer Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390443].   
Background  
The COVID -[ADDRESS_489611] management secondary to 
aerosol generation. The absolute risk increase is between 10% (cohort studies) and 
15% (case -control studies) for transmission of SARS -CoV -1–associated infection to 
health care personnel performing intubation.[ADDRESS_489612] management 
of confirmed positive COVID -19 or persons under investigation (PUI) involve the 
use of full personal protect ive equipment (PPE) including N95 masks and the routine 
use of video laryngoscopy when accessible. Unrecognized asymptomatic and pre -
symptomatic infections with SARS - CoV -[ADDRESS_489613] been compelled to improvise  protective barrier enclosures for use 
during endotracheal intubation to minimize aerosol exposure  to operating  room 
personnel . We decided to evaluate time to intubate with an intubation barrier box to 
demonstrate safe use for routine anesthetic inductions during this pandemic era.  
Funding:  
NONE  
Study Design:  
Prospective randomized controlled trial  
Recruitment methods:  
Source of participants: Patients undergoing elective surgery at Robert Packer 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390444] -operative clinic after surgery date has been finalized. 
Patients will be invited to take part and provided a letter of invitation.  The researcher 
will answer any questions and verbal consent will be obtained.   
Total participants:   
The study plans to enroll approximately 72 subjects to two groups with 36 subjects 
in each group.  This sample size is based on the estimated time difference of 10 
seconds between intubation times with and without the box.  
Inclusion criteria ;  
Males and females above 18 years of age who are undergoing elective surgery at 
Robert Packer Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390445].  
Exclusion criteria:  
Children, pregnant women, and prisoners, ASA 4 ,ASA 5, patients with severe 
cardiopulmonary compromise, BMI >[ADDRESS_489614], 
patients with positive COVID status or person under investigation.  
Statistics:  
Comparing time to intubate  (TTI)  between study and control group using a t -test to 
compare means.  
Study end points:  
Primary end point:  
Calculating time  to intubate (TTI) which is defined as time duration from loss of 
twitch to confirmation of end tidal C O 2. 
Secondary end point:  
1)Time  duration from induction with propofol to confirmation of endotracheal tube  
2) Need for bag mask ventilation and duration of ventilation  
3)Epi[INVESTIGATOR_390446]2 < 90 % 
4)Subjective assessment of intubation by [CONTACT_48368]: easy /moderate /difficult  
 
Study Timelines:  
Individual subjects participation is limited to time spent in operating room  
Duration for enrolling all participants: 2 months  
Estimated date to complete study: 4 months  
Procedures involved in Human research:  
After obtaining a verbal informed consent, patients will be randomized into study 
group - IB (intubation barrier box used) and control group -C (no intubation barrier 
box used).  
Subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_17188].  Randomization will be done 
by a random number generated computer program by [CONTACT_390450].  The randomization schedule will be placed in sealed envelopes to be 
concealed from the r esearcher until time of verbal consent.   
After placement of intravenous line in pre - operative area,  anxiolytics  may be given  
as per the discretion of anesthesiologist caring for the patient. After arrival to OR, 
patient will be placed on standard ASA monitors. An intubation barrier box designed 
by [CONTACT_390451] –medical team will be placed at the head end of operating table in the 
study group (IB) and patient will be comfortably positioned with their head on a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_390447].  
Patients in control group - No intubation box.  
Routine p rocedures  for all patients:  
Patients head will be positioned in optimal position.  Head - end of the operating table 
elevated to 20 degrees  to improve pulmonary reserve. A twitch monitor is placed 
pre induction.  
Pre oxygenation will be achieved by [CONTACT_390452] 3 minutes  of tidal volume breaths/ [ADDRESS_489615] induction doses of lidocaine 1 - 1.5 mg/kg, fentanyl 1 -2  mcg/kg and 
propofol  1-2 mg/kg   followed with saline flush .  After loss of consciousness is 
confirmed , patients will be given Succinyl choline 1.5 mg /kg total body weight 
(TBW) for paralysis.  Apneic oxygenation will be continued after induction.  
Ventilation will not be performed during this time unless desaturation with spo2 less 
than 90 % is observed . Loss of Train of four  (TOF) will be checked to confirm 
paralysis, and the provider  will proceed with intubation.  
A video laryngoscope ( glidescope ) with st yle  will be used for intubation of all 
patients. Time to intubate  (TTI) will be calculated  by [CONTACT_390453].  If intubation is unsuccessful by [CONTACT_390454] 
, further  attempts  by [CONTACT_390455] . If difficulty 
to intubate is deemed secondary to intubation box, it will be removed  immediately.  
Intubation procedure will be performed by [CONTACT_390456] [ADDRESS_489616] 3 intubations  with intubation barrier box with 
patients.  
Timing of all events will be performed by [CONTACT_390457] .  
Other data points calculated.  
Induction time – loss of spontaneous ventilation to placement of ETT.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_390448]2  < 90 % 
Time duration of bag –mask ventilation if needed.  
Source record:  Electronic medical record  
Long - term data collection:  None  
Withdrawal of participants:  
Unanticipated difficult intubation as described by > 3 attempts by [CONTACT_390458].  
Patients in the study will be excluded secondary to any equipment malfunction  
 or unforeseen delays not related to patient care . 
 
Risk to participants:  
By [CONTACT_8345], there is a minimal risk to the participants in this study.  The intubation 
barrier box could be a source of claustrophobia to the patient which will be mitigated 
by [CONTACT_390459]. The intubation box will be removed if it creates any difficulty 
in intubation.  
Provisions to maintain confidentiality of the data:  
Measures will be taken to protect patient confidentiality in accordance with HIPAA 
guidelines. Patient ’s names will not be used on the data collection sheet. Medical 
record numbers will be used on the data collection sheet. Once data collection has 
been completed, the MRN will be removed from the datasheet and the patients will 
be numbered consecutively. No patient names or medical record numbers will be 
published. Descriptiv e statistics will be used to summarize our objectives. Data will 
be stored as an electronic file on a password -protected computer and will only be 
available to primary and co -investigators.  
Potential direct benefit to patients:  
There are no direct benefits to patient s, but they may be making a contribution to the 
scientific knowledge, and help create a model for correcting deficiencies, if present.  
Information  demonstrated by [CONTACT_390460].  
Participant Compensation/Cost  
There will be no payment or costs to subjects.  
Vulnerable populations:  
Children will be excluded from the study. Pregnant women and prisoners will not be 
specifically targeted for chart review.  
Consent process:  
Due to the prospective design of the study, a consent will be taken. Consent will be 
obtained verbal rather than written. A waiver of consent documentation is requested 
from the IRB because the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subject s, and the research involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context  and is part of routine anesthesia 
patient care.  The verbal consen t will take place during pre - operative assessment 
prior to the surge ry by a  member of research team .  
Sharing the results with the participants:  
There are no plans to directly share data or results with the participants.  
Sharing of individual participant data with other researchers  
There is no plan to make individual participant data collected in this study available 
to other researchers.  Data will be fully de-identified before sharing.

Statistic al analysis plan:  
Sample size calculation  
Sample size calculation was done by [CONTACT_390462] (Dupont and Plummer, 1990). Based on a study by [CONTACT_390463]. al.,  
(2019), the mean of intubation time for Glidescope was 31.[ADDRESS_489617]. The two -tailed  
hypothesis testing concluded that each group needed 36 subjects to achieve a power of 80%,  
with an error rate of 5%. A total of 90 subjects will be enrolled in this study with an estimated  
dropout rate set at 20%, 45 subjects will be enrolled in each group.

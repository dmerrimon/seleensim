1. To determine the feasibility of acquiring  in-vivo high-resolution microendoscopy  (HRME)  
images of cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)  immediately prior to conization.  
 
2. To determine accuracy of HRME  images in distinguishing  AIS from normal cervical tissue.  
 
 
2.0 Background  
 
Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) : 
Cervical AIS is a precursor to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma, which accounts for 
approximately 25% of cervical cancers in the [LOCATION_002]  (1). While the incidence of squamous 
cell carcinoma of the cervix has been on the decline in the U.S. due to widespread screening, 
detection, and treatment of precancerous lesions, t he incidence of both AIS and invasive cervical 
adenocarcinoma has been rising for unclear reasons  (2). Similar to squamous cervical 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN)  and squamous cell carcinoma, cervical AIS and invasive 
adenocarcinoma are caused by [CONTACT_908706]- risk human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) . AIS is histologically characterized by [CONTACT_32593][INVESTIGATOR_908684].  Unlike squamous CIN lesions, 10 to 13% of patients with AIS have 
multifocal disease,  with foci of AIS separated by [CONTACT_2669] 2 mm of normal mucosa (“skip ” lesions ) 
(1,3-5). 
 
The majority of patients are asymptomatic and the diagnosis of AIS is usually made following an 
abnormal Pap test.  There are no clearly distinguishable clinical, cytological or colposcopic 
features of AIS. The lesion is usually located at the transformation zone with contiguous 
involvement of the endocervical canal (1, 6). Cervical cytology and colposcopy -directed biopsy 
can miss up to 60% of AIS cases, however, the addition of endocervical curettage (ECC) 
significantly improves the detection rate (7).   Cervical conization is usually required to make the 
diagnosis of AIS.  Cold knife conization is preferred over loop electro surgical excision procedure 
(LEEP) as it minimizes the risk of thermal artifact and allows the pathologist to determine the 
presence of invasive disease and margin status (8 -10).   
 
AIS is difficult to manage cons ervatively for several reasons.  The lesion may be located high in 
the endocervical canal or be multicentr ic with “skip” lesions present.  The sensitivity of cervical 
cytology and ECC is therefore only approximately 50% , making it difficult to adequately monitor 
women with AIS managed conservatively  (4,11). In addition, the incidence of residual AIS or 
invasive adenocarcinoma following conization for AIS is high (3 -5, 9, 12- 14). Given these 
challenges, the standard treatment of AIS in women who have completed childbearing is simple 
hysterectomy.  However, if the cervical cone margins are positive, a repeat cervical conization is 
performed prior to proceeding to simple hysterectomy to confirm negative margins and rule out 
an invasive occult cancer that could require different treatment.  For women who desire future 
fertility, conservat ive management with cervical cone is an alternative provided the conization 
margi ns and ECC sample are negative.  In women with a positive margin or ECC, repeat 
conization to remove the entire lesion and exclude the presence of invasive disease is 
recommended.

High-Resolution M icroendoscopy (HRME) Imaging : 
The HRME imaging system is a low -cost, innovative cervical visualization technique to evaluate 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_908685] . Proflavine, 
a topi[INVESTIGATOR_908686] a manner similar to the application 
of acetic acid at the time of colposcopy. The 
tip of a small fiber -optic probe is then placed 
directly onto the cervix, and the fluorescence 
from the proflavine- stained epi[INVESTIGATOR_908687] a laptop computer, 
tablet or cell phone screen (Fig. 1). 
Morphologic features typi[INVESTIGATOR_908688], 
pleomorphism, and nuclear -to-cytoplasm 
(N/C) ratio are a ssessed in vivo  in real -time. 
Image analysis software is then used to 
quantify nuclear morphology parameters 
and calculate N/C ratio. This approach 
allows for real -time, point -of-care detection 
of high -grade precancerous cervical lesions wi thout a biopsy being performed.  The technique 
has been shown to be effective in the evaluation of squamous lesions and is being studied as 
part of a “See & Treat” approach in limited resource settings where patients can be screened 
and treated at the same visit with cryot herapy or LEEP.  
 
3.0 Preliminary Data and Rationale  
 
Cervical adenocarcinoma in- situ (AIS) : 
Our group recently performed a large, retrospective study evaluating the out comes of 188 
patients with AIS  (15). The mean age at diagnosis was 33.8 years (range 17.6- 76.1), with many 
women of childbearing age.  One hundred and seventy -two of the [ADDRESS_1275814] one 
cone biopsy performed, with 110 (64.0%) undergoing a cold knife cone (CKC), and 62 (36.0%) 
underg oing a LEEP as their initial method of treatment.  Positive margins were noted in 35.0% 
of patients undergoing CKC compared with 55.6% undergoing LEEP (p=0.017). Seventy -one 
patients ultimately underwent hysterectomy with residual disease noted in 10 patients (14.1%), 
8 patients (11.3%) with residual AIS and 2 patients (2.8%) with invasive carcinoma.  Of the 101 
patients who did not undergo hysterectomy, 2 patients (2.0%) developed recurrent AIS at a 
median of 27.5 months (range 18-  37 months) from the last cone, and none developed invasive 
carcinoma. However , 28.6% of patients required more than one conizati on to achieve negative 
margins.  The study concluded that conservative, fertility -sparing management of AIS with CKC 
alone is feasible but that two or more  CKCs may be required to obtain negative margins.  
 
High-Resolution Microendoscopy (HRME) Imaging : 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_908689] -invasive cervical neoplasia was recently

HRME image showing small, evenly spaced nuclei. (g) Colposcopic

 4 performed in 174 women in rural China (16) . All patients underwent HPV testing, VIA, 
colposcopy and HRME imaging. Of the [ADDRESS_1275815] abnormalities on colposcopy, 
only 12 (17%) showed high- grade disease on biopsy. However, HRME imaging correctly 
classified all 12 high -grade areas (100%) as abnormal, and correctl y classified 38 of the 
remaining 57 (67%) as normal. Furthermore, when patients were stratified based on a positive 
high-risk HPV DNA test, HRME imaging correctly identified 100% of the patients with CIN2 or 
greater. Of the [ADDRESS_1275816] but no histologic evidence of 
disease, only 6 patients (20%) were incorrectly identified as abnormal on HRME imaging. These 
preliminary data suggest that HRME has improved specificity over VIA and colposcopy, 
potentially leading to more accurate identification of patients needing treatment as part of a See 
& Treat  protocol. Our collaborative group also recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_908690] 60 patients with cervical dysplasia at Barretos  Cancer Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_908691] .  
 
Our group is also evaluating HRME for use in conservative, fertility -sparing surgery for  women 
with endometrial cancer.  We are evaluating if  HRME can help distinguish tumor margins in 
women undergoing resection of the endometrial tumor without  hysterectomy. We recently 
completed a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_908692]. Following hysterectomy, the uterus was examined ex -vivo to identify whether HRM E 
could distinguish between tumor and normal endometrium following the application of  proflavine.  
Preliminary results show a 74% concordance rate between HRME and final pathology , which is 
significantly higher than the 59% concordance rate between gross  evaluation and final 
pathology.  A prospective trial evaluating HRME in -vivo in women with endometrial cancer was 
recently approved and accrual will begin in the near future.  
 
Rationale : 
Cervical AIS is a significant pre- invasive disease that aff ects women of childbearing age.  For 
women who desire future fertility, conservative management with cervical conization is  
considered a feasible option.  However, the treatment is challenging as lesion s are often located  
high in the endocervical canal, and are multicentric with “skip” lesions present . Repeat 
conizations must therefore be performed until negative margins are obtained.  Given the 
microscopic nature of the disease, the surgeon typi[INVESTIGATOR_908693] . Furthermore, frozen section is difficult and 
inaccurate in assessing AIS margins.  This lack of accurate intraoperative assessment results in 
25-30% of patients undergoing  one or more repeated conizat ions to obtain negative margins. In 
addition, an unnecessarily large specimen is sometimes removed in an att empt to be certain of 
obtaining negative margins.  These l arge and repeat cervical conizations are known to be  
associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes, including preterm delivery and very low birth 
weight infants  (17-19).  
 
In order to overcome these  challenges associated with the conservative management of AIS, 
we are proposing to use HRME, a novel cervical visualization technique,  to evaluate epi[INVESTIGATOR_908694] A IS from normal cervical tissue.  Our overall goal  
is to eventually use HRME to guide resection margins at the time of cervical conization for AIS . 
Our primary objective is to  determine the feasibility of acquiring  in-vivo high-resolution 
microendoscopy (HRME) images of cervical adenocarcinoma in situ  (AIS) immediately prior to 
conization.   Our secondary objective is to determine accuracy of HRME images in distinguishing 
AIS from normal cervical tissue.

6.0 Research Plan and Method s 
 
Treatment Plan : 
The patient will be taken to the operating room and per standard practice, prior to converting the 
surgical area to a sterile field, an exam under anesthesia will be p erformed. Five percent  acetic 
acid will be applied to the cervix. Routine colposcopy with visual inspection of the cervix for 
aceto- whitening will be performed and the findings noted. This will be followed by [CONTACT_391774][INVESTIGATOR_106014] 0.01% proflavine solution to the cervix. T he HRME probe will then be applied to 
areas of the cervix  that appear to be both normal and abnormal.  H igh-resolution images will be 
obtained and the findings noted. Lugol’s solution may  then be applied to the cervix per standard  
practice and the findings  noted.  This may be followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-application of 0.01% proflavine 
solution to the cervix. The HRME probe will then be applied to areas of the cervix  that appear to 
be both normal and abnormal.  High- resolution images will be obtained and the findings noted.  
 
The patient and surgical area will then be prepped in the typi[INVESTIGATOR_908696].  A cold knife 
cone biopsy will then be performed per standard practice.  The investigational procedures are 
anticipated to add approximately 10 minutes to the  patient’s time in the operating room . 
 
  Protocol [ADDRESS_1275817] ion of the informed consent . 
 
 
Proflavine : 
Proflavine powder will be purchased from Sigma- Aldrich and t he solution will be prepared by [CONTACT_908707].  
Data : 
The protocol specific  data collected will be stored i n the Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap) System /CORe.  
Data collected will include the following, as well as all other protocol specific data : 
• Age at diagnosis  
• Histology  
• Date of diagnosis  
• Date of surgery  
• Operative time  
• Duration of time for intraoperative HRME imaging 
• HRME imaging findings  
• Final pathologic findings

used in imaging. Proflavine may be combustible at high temperatures. Proflavine is the principal 
component of acriflavine and has been used for fluorescent imaging in the European, Asian, and 
Australian gastrointestinal literature without any adverse effects noted. Proflavine has been 
clinically used as an antibacterial agent.   In neonatal care, Triple dye, a combination of brilliant 
green, proflavine hemisulfate, and gentian violet is routinely used as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_908697] (21), with a recent review of the practice categoriz ing 
toxicity as rare (22).   We propose the use of proflavine solution at concentrations lower than that 
of the proflavine component in commercial triple dye, 0.11% (w/v) (Kerr Triple Dye, 
VistaPharm).   We have currently done several patients with Barrett’s  esophagus under an 
existing protocol and IND and no complications or adverse events have been reported. The 
  Protocol 2013 -0885 
  July 12 , 2019  
 
 7 quantity of solution used for diagnostic imaging is likely to be no greater than that used in 
neonatal care (0.65 ml per single- use swab).   Investi gational in vivo  human studies of confocal 
microscopy for gastrointestinal cancer currently use topi[INVESTIGATOR_908698] 0.05% concentration 
(23).   
 
The additional exposure to light which will occur during imaging can also be compared to that 
received by [CONTACT_908708].   The high -resolution fiber -
optic microendoscope proposed for use here delivers 0.5 mW of 455 nm light to the tissue 
through a 0.8 mm diameter fiber -optic bundle, corresponding to an irradiance level of 
100 mW/cm2.  The American Academy of Pediatrics defines intensive phototherapy as a 
spectral irradiance of at least 30 mW/cm2 per nanometer over the 430- 490 nm spectral band, 
equivalent to a total irradiance of 1.8 mW/cm2 (24).  Although the irradiance level is over 50-
times higher with the fiber microendoscope system, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_908699] 30 minutes 
(including imaging for routine care) is approximately 50- times shorter than a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 24 hour 
(1440 minutes) phototherapy incubation, leading to an equivalent light dose in each scenario.   
  
The imaging procedure will add approximately 10 minutes to the patient’s time in  the operating 
room . There is the rare possibility that there may be additional risks from the added time of 
additional sedation.  
 
 
8.0 Criteria for Removal from Study:  
 
1.  Any patient who is consented for the study but prior to surgery declines to participate in the 
study.  
2.  Any patient in whom the surgery is scheduled but not performed . 
3.  Any patient who withdraws consent  for any re ason.  
 
 
9.0 Patient Confidentiality  
 
All pathology specimens, evaluations forms, reports and other patient records will be identified 
in a manner designed to maintain patient confidentiality.  All data and specimens will be entered 
into REDCap /CORe . Clinical information will not be released without the written permission of 
the patient or the patient’s guardian, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_908709], regulatory authorities, or the IRB.  
 
Study data will  be collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) 
electronic data capture tools hosted at MD Anderson. [24] REDCap (www.project -redcap.org) is 
a secure, web- based application with controlled access designed to support data capture for 
research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for 
tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless 
downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external 
sources. In the case of multi -center studies REDCap uses Data Access Groups (DAGs) to 
ensure th at personnel at each institution are blinded to the data from other institutions. REDCap 
(https://redcap.mdanderson.org) is hosted on a secure server by [CONTACT_38181]'s 
Department of Research Information Systems & Technology Services. REDCap has undergone

Institutional Policy #ADM0335. Those having access to the data file include the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_908700]. All protected health information (PHI) will be removed from the data 
when it is exported from REDCap for analysis  or re view by [CONTACT_908710].  All dates for a given patient will be shifted by a randomly generated number between 
0 and 364, thus preserving the distance between dates. Dates for each patient will be shifted by 
a different randomly g enerated number.  
 
The investigators and all employees and co- workers involved with this study shall not disclose 
or use for any purpose, other than performance of the study, any data, records or other 
unpublished, confidential information disclosed to thos e individuals  for the purpose of the study.  
No patient identifiers will be used when analyzing the data or reporting the results.  
 
For this protocol we will only capture adverse events that are determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_908701]/or HRME imaging.  Adverse events and serious adverse events 
related to the standard of care CKC  will not be captured as part of the protocol data

work out the logistical issues in the use of the imaging technology with the surgery  as well as  
evaluation of safety .  We will then examine data from the remaining patients in cohorts of 5. 
After each cohort of 5 patients we will review the logistics of the imaging technology and make 
adjustments deemed necessary to i mprove the surgical procedure.  We will also evaluate 
safety .  
 
Our primary objective is t o determine the feasibility of acquiring  in-vivo high-resolution 
microendoscopy (HRME) images of cervical adenocarcinoma in- situ (AIS) immediately prior to 
conization.  We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the demographic and clinical 
characteristics of patients. We will estimate the proportion of patients for  whom we can 
successfully acquire in -vivo HRME images of AIS immediately prior to conization with a 90% 
credible interval, assuming a beta(1.8, 0.2) prior distribution. This prior distribution is based on 
an anticipated success rate of 90%. If we complete the study with 18 patients for whom we can 
successfully acquire in -vivo HRME images of AIS, then our 90% credible interval will be 0.[ADDRESS_1275820] 18 of the 20 
patients enrolled in the s tudy, then we will determine that the methodology is feasible.  
 
Our secondary objective is to determine the accuracy of HRME images in distinguishing AIS 
from normal cervical tissue. We will tabulate AIS finding by [CONTACT_908711], and we will estimate the concordance of HRME images taken ex-vivo 
(as described in section 6.0) with pathology findings with a 90% credible, assuming a beta  (1.8, 
0.2) prior distribution for the concordance . 
 
11.0 Serious Adver se Event Reporting (SAE) for MD  Anderson- Sponsored IND Protocols   
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
  Protocol 2013 -0885 
  July 12 , 2019  
 
 9  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience - any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.   
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/ birth defect.  
 
Impo rtant medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require  
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do  not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 
Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse events. 
Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND Office.  
 
All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must 
be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and proc edures outlined in “The 
University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for 
Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.  Unless stated 
otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, 
regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
 
All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, must have 
a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the 
Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
 
Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting 
to the IND Office and MDACC IRB. Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the 
first protocol -specific intervention, until [ADDRESS_1275821] be reported to the IND Office. This may include the development of 
a secondary malignancy.  
 
All adverse events encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) version 4.03.

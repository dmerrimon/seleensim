1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a major liver disease. Liver inflammation is a key feature of AH. We are testing if 
administering digoxin orally to healthy subjects results in a reduction in innate immune inflammatory 
responses in the peripheral blood, and if digoxin can alter binding of PKM2 to pro-inflammatory loci in primary 
human monocytes, and identify novel gene targets for PKM2. 
Hypothesis: Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) regulates liver inflammation by [CONTACT_25764]-regulating HIF-1 and other pro-
inflammatory genes, and this can be inhibited by [CONTACT_278645].
Aim 1. Obtain clinical data supporting the therapeutic use of digoxin in alcoholic hepatitis. 
Aim 2. Identify dominant and novel targets that are regulated by [CONTACT_278646]2 in alcoholic hepatitis. 
       Aim 3. Obtain plasma proteomic and molecular data to allow for early identification of patients with SIRS.
2.Probable Duration of Project: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
204 weeks
3.Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
The development of sterile inflammation after cell death is a ubiquitous response which occurs in all organs. 
The liver is notable for developi[INVESTIGATOR_278633]. This is seen in 
experimental and human alcoholic steatohepatitis (AH). It is also notable that for (AH) there is no effective 
therapy. This is in contrast to suppression of T cell responses, for which potent drugs exist (tacrolimus and 
cyclosporine). In addition to the lack of effective therapy, we also have a poor ability to identify patients with 
AH who will develop clinically significant systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), which is associated with 
higher mortality. The sterile inflammatory response in the liver incorporates many cell types and signaling 
pathways, and two processes among these are universally present. One is an increased tissue redox state, 
which plays a key role in the progression of inflammatory disorders. There are many cellular mechanisms of 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), with tissue hypoxia and activation of the HIF-1α pathway being a 
dominant one. Acute and chronic alcohol exposure result in liver hypoxia leading to HIF-1α  pathway activation 
in AH. The requirement for HIF-1α activation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was demonstrated by [CONTACT_278647]-1α  antisense nucleotide treatment to offer protection. We have demonstrated that HIF-1α  
activation potentiates and sustains the amplitude of acute inflammatory responses, and is vital for the 
transition from acute self-limiting to sustained chronic inflammation. There is also a close positive relationship 
between HIF-1α  activation and increased ROS production. These mechanistic insights into the role of the HIF-
1α  pathway in sterile inflammation may have great clinical relevance due to the ability of cardiac glycosides 
(CGs) to inhibit HIF-1α  activation. CGs are well known in cardiology due to their effects of increasing 
ionotropy, and decreasing chronotropy, via partial inhibition of the Na+ /K+ ATPase on the plasma membrane 
of myocytes. Of note the HIF-1α  inhibitory effect of CGs is independent of its activity on the Na+ /K+ ATPase, 
indicating CGs have additional unidentified molecular targets. In this application, we describe a novel and 
potent role for digoxin in reducing the severity of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocellular damage in livers 
undergoing AH. Digoxin improves oxidative stress during liver injury through maintaining cellular redox 
homeostasis, and suppressing HIF-1α  pathway activation. We have further identified the key metabolic 
regulator pyruvate kinase isoform 2 (PKM2) as a digoxin-binding protein. PKM2 isoform exists primarily as an 
enzymatically inactive dimer which can translocate to the nucleus, where it will interact with HIF-1α  and 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 4/19/2023
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 4/19/2023Page 3 of 21regulate expression of numerous genes. Interestingly, digoxin does not alter PKM2 kinase activity but 
suppresses PKM2 dependent transcriptional activity. This area is significant because sterile inflammation (SI) is 
the central pathological process in AH. Our results identify PKM2 as a key molecule in liver sterile inflammation 
which can be therapeutically targeted. The identification of digoxin as a PKM2 binder, which leads to critical 
anti-inflammatory effects, provides a novel opportunity to reduce liver inflammation in AH. We have further 
identified a unique molecular profile from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_278634]-proteomic screen which will be expanded to the 
whole InTeam cohort to provide predictive markers for severe AH.
4.Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and 
lengths. Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
Test if administering digoxin orally to healthy subjects results in a reduction in innate immune inflammatory 
responses in the peripheral blood. 
We need to obtain peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy subjects on different doses of digoxin to test if 
digoxin has an effect on the immune response of PBLs. 
A) There will be three study groups. 
Groups:
A: Placebo n=15                     B: Digoxin 3 mcg/Kg/day n=15                       C: Digoxin 0.15 mcg/Kg/day n=15
Serum digoxin concentrations, BUN, Creatinine, CBC, Electrolytes (Na, K) and ECGs will be obtained weekly. 
pregnancy testing for female participants of childbearing potential and a baseline screening to determine if you 
are eligible for this study. Peripheral blood (25ml) in EDTA tubes (purple top) will be obtained at 0, 1, 2, 3 weeks 
after starting digoxin, with written consent and in accordance with the guidelines of Yale University ethics 
committee. PMN and monocytes will be isolated using PolymorphPrep (Axis-Shield) according to standard 
procedure, and purity will be determined by [CONTACT_278648]. Spontaneous ROS of PMNs will be measured 
by [CONTACT_278649]-H2DCFA for 30 minutes, washing, followed by [CONTACT_278650]. Neutrophils up-regulate ROS spontaneously in culture, and for each sample the un-

C-E) All reports and analyses will be generated from these files. Data files (and accompanying programs) that are 
used for reports, presentations, or publication will be archived as required past the end of the study. REDCap will 
also have the audit trail capability enabled for tracing any data modifications. Data from laboratories can be 
uploaded directly into REDCap for storage. The REDCap system will be programmed and maintained by [CONTACT_278651] U Mass Medical School AlcHepNet Data Coordinating Center while data entry will be performed by [CONTACT_278652].
The sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_278636], where differences in as few as 5 
participants were seen to be significantly different. Given the inherent variability in the absorption of digoxin in 
humans, a sample size of 15 was determined to be reasonable to provide a reasonable distribution of results from 
repeated measures of participants at the differing digoxin dose levels.
F) Pregnancy: The chance of a female subject to become pregnant on a 4-week study is very less, if in case 
this does happen they will be asked to stop the drug and withdraw from the study immediately. We do 
not intend to follow the pregnancy and birth outcome. 
Drug preparation: Digoxin is commercially available as a 0.05mg/ml elixir (Boehringer Ingelheim). The
appropriate dosing of digoxin and control will be prepared with the help of the Yale Center for Clinical
Investigation (YCCI) as detailed in the facilities and resources. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]: Subjects will be removed from the 
study if any serum digoxin level is above 0.8ng/ml, or if there are any abnormalities in blood tests or
ECGs. Data from these subjects will not be used in the analysis. Analysis, expected outcome and
alternative approaches: It is expected that there will not be a significant difference in the neutrophil ROS
and monocyte qPCR results in control group A between the four time points. It is expected that for group B
and C, both neutrophil ROS and monocyte qPCR levels will be lower at time points 1, 2, 3 weeks as compared
to time 0, and as compared to all time points of group A. It is not clear if in group D time points of week 1, 2,
and 3 will be any different from time point 0. For the time points where significant differences are found we
will perform additional luminex assay with the supernatant using the luminex five plex panel (GM-CSF, IL-
1B, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α ). There will also be an analysis of the production of ROS and qPCR levels in relation to
serum digoxin levels at the time that the analysis samples were obtained. The combinations of these analysis
will establish that digoxin taken orally is effective in reducing inflammatory responses, and will also provide
information on dose response for oral dosing as well as serum concentrations.

anxiety, depression, slow heart rate, enlarged or tender breasts in men, or skin rash.
• Risks and discomforts of phlebotomy: To obtain detailed biochemical liver function tests and blood 
samples for research, blood sampling will be required. Patients will have 4 venipunctures during the period of 
evaluation (28 days). Each venipuncture will remove ~18 ml of blood. However, no more than 6 ml/kg will be 
drawn from any one person during this 4-week period. Blood collection by [CONTACT_278653], and possible risk of localized bruising, phlebitis, or extravasation. The risk of infection or fainting is 
extremely small.
• Risks and Inconveniences of an electro-cardiogram (EKG): EKG is very safe procedure which is being 
performed very commonly for evaluation of cardiac status. There is no risk of performing EKG to the subjects, 
however, there may be slight inconvenience of cold sensations to the skin related to the application of gel at the 
site of EKG leads placement.
11.Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.

conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency, which must be conducted at a minimum of 
every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought).  During the review process, the 
principal investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, require 
modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either the principal investigator, the IRB have the 
authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.
2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal for the following 
reasons: (choose those that apply)
1. We do not view the risks associated with the __________ as minimal risks.
2. We do not view the risks associated with the combined use of ________and_________ as 
minimal risks.
3. Given the now established safety and validity of the current _drug________ in our prior work, 
we do not view the proposed studies as high risk.
4. Given our experience with the combined co-administration_________, we do not view the 
proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential exists 
for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not

safety of the proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] ([CONTACT_278660]) according to the following 
categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate adverse event
3. Severe 
5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22414] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of 
the following outcomes:
1. Death;
2. A life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]; 
3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
4. A congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
5. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  
Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is 
important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when determining 
whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.

13.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design. 
Primary analyses of the biochemical measures will be conducted using mixed effects models to account for the 
correlation among the biochemical measures obtained from repeated blood draws on the same participant. The 
models will include digoxin dose (3 mcg/kg/day, 0.15 mcg/kg/day, none/placebo), time on study (weeks 0, 1, 2, 
and 3), and relevant patient characteristics (i.e., age, gender). A random intercept will be included so that each 
participant will have their own starting point and time will be a categorical predictor to better model a potential 
curvilinear relationship between time on study and biochemical levels without assuming a linear slope. Because 
treatment group is a three-level variable, we will first conduct a Type III multi-degree of freedom test to determine 
if any difference exists among the three groups and, if that is significant, conduct all pairwise comparisons to 
determine where the difference is. Because these tests are not independent, we will apply a Bonferroni correction 
to the critical p-value to reduce the possibility of a Type I error by [CONTACT_29745]. In this case, the critical p-value will 
be set at 0.05/3 = 0.[ADDRESS_340316] any adverse events, both serious (SAE) and not, described by [CONTACT_278654]. Each AE will include a description of the AE/SAE, relatedness to digoxin, and resolution. These will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_22975], if there are three or more participants in any one group with a specific 
AE/SAE, we will conduct a statistical test (Likelihood Ratio Chi-Square) to determine any statistically significant 
difference among the treatment groups using the analogous approach as above to first test for any difference in 
the incidence of AE/SAE among the three treatment groups followed by [CONTACT_278655], again using the Likelihood Ratio Chi-Square. Because this is a safety analysis, the critical p-value is 
left at 0.05 for all comparisons to avoid increasing the probability of a Type II error.

Cardiac glycosides have been used since ancient Egyptians, and the clinical effects of digoxin were first 
characterized in 1785, and was approved by [CONTACT_278656]-1990’s. Since then many hundreds of thousands of 
patients have taken digoxin and there are no side-effects when serum levels are maintained in or below the 
therapeutic range. We have selected a dose that will maintain serum levels in or below the therapeutic range and 
in addition we serum levels will be monitored weekly.

5. What will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy the identifiable 
data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If no, describe how the data and/or 
identifiers will be secured. Once the research is complete, the data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_278658] a statistician. Data will be kept for five years after the study ends. Data will then be de-identified using 
a “Safe Harbor” (45CFR164.514(b)(2)) approach consistent with the HIPAA Privacy rule. De-identified data will 
be certified by a statistician that there is a very small risk that use of the protected health information could lead 
to a subject being identified. The principal investigator ([CONTACT_278661]) is responsible for the 
implementation of data de-identification.

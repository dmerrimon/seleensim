71.BACKGROUND
1.1 Study Disease
Administration of exogenous testosterone as efficacious treatment for male hypogonadism has been 
part of medical practice for more than 50 years. Testosterone has both anabolic and androgenic 
properties serving as the primary male hormone promoting development of male reproductive 
tissues such as the prostate and testis. Several androgen replacement modalities are FDA approved 
and commercially available or are under clinical investigation. Options for testosterone replacement 
include intramuscular injection of testosterone esters, subcutaneous implants, transdermal patches, oral 
tablets and capsules, buccal and sublingual forms, topi[INVESTIGATOR_98787] 5α-
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and intranasal gels, currently marketed as name [CONTACT_98818].
Testosterone can activate androgen receptors in its native form or it can be converted to 5α-
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by [CONTACT_98804] 5α reductase before binding to the androgen receptor. 
Once bound, the receptor-hormone complex moves into the cell nucleus inducing cell specific 
gene expression profiles, therefore promoting protein synthesis and growth/differentiation of 
tissues that are sensitive to its action.1    
Hypogonadism, or low testosterone (Low T), is defined by a deficiency in producing normal 
amounts of testosterone due to a failure of the testicles (primary hypogonadism), pi[INVESTIGATOR_304] 
(secondary hypogonadism).  Hypogonadism is accompanied by [CONTACT_23805], such as decreased 
libido, depression and/or lack of energy. Low T affects more than 10% of men worldwide, with 
higher incidence in the elderly.2 It typi[INVESTIGATOR_98788], chronic disease, 
physical trauma, chemotherapy and other modifiable risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.1 
Testosterone deficiency has been associated with less muscle mass4, lower bone mineral density5, 
anemia6, diminished energy and sexual dysfunction.8,9
1.2 Study Interventions
Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is becoming more widely available and has seen a greater 
than three-fold increase in use in men 40 years and older.10 Current delivery systems of TRT 
include transdermal gels and patches11, intranasal gels (currently marketed as Natesto)12, injection 
therapy13, and long acting subcutaneous pellets.14 TRT has been shown to improve bone mineral 
density, and sexual function with some studies suggesting improvement in energy, vitality, and 
depression symptoms.9 
Advantages of testosterone nasal gel (Natesto) over other TRT options includes ease of 
administration, relatively low dose exposure, and no risk of secondary transference. Natesto, 
administered, using a multiple-dose dispenser, as three daily doses (5.5 mg per nostril, 11.0 mg 
single dose restores normal serum total testosterone (≥300 ng/dL, ≤1050 ng/dL) levels in most 
hypogonadal men after 90 days of use. More recently, it was found that 90.9% of men on 
Natesto 11mg TID achieved normal testosterone levels (≥300 ng/dL) after 6 months of use).12 

Version 1.0

8Natesto is a short-acting formulation of testosterone delivered intranasally to men diagnosed with 
low T. This has the potential to avoid side effects related to TRT that are commonly seen with 
other delivery methods, namely polycythemia, acne, male-pattern hair loss, azoospermia and 
hyperestrogenemia. Daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_98789] a risk of transfer of testosterone to partners 
and family members which is minimized with Natesto since it is dispensed with a device high 
into the nostril and thereby [CONTACT_98805], and further, the formulation 
is designed not to be absorbed through the skin (contains no lower alcohols or permeation 
enhancers).

Cypi[INVESTIGATOR_98791], the most common being polycythemia, gynecomastia, 
hair loss, acne, decreased spermatogenesis, and testicular atrophy. In a multicenter retrospective 
study, it has been shown that the prevalence of polycythemia in men on testosterone replacement 
(injections) was 11.2%16. Uniquely, the incidence of polycythemia in patients using Natesto is 
1.3%.15 In this study, we will compare hematocrit changes caused by [CONTACT_27180] f 
Testosterone Cypi[INVESTIGATOR_98792] in a parallel arm, randomized study. To date, there have been 
no direct head-to-haed comparisons of these formulations.
Treatment was well tolerated; adverse event rates werelow. Adverse event discontinuation rates were 2.1% (b.i.d.) and 3.7% (t.i.d.)Treatment was well tolerated; adverse event rates werelow. Adverse event discontinuation rates were 2.1% (b.i.d.) and 3.7% (t.i.d.)
2. HYPOTHESIS 
We hypothesize that the short-acting pharmacokinetics of Natesto more closely resembles the 
natural pulsatility of testosterone and therefore can avoid side effects traditionally seen in long-
acting, exogenous testosterone formulations.

7. STUDY DESIGN, CLINICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, LABORATORY AND SURGICAL 
EVALUATIONS
7.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase IV, multicenter, prospective, randomized, non-blinded clinical study aimed to 
evaluate the comparison between Natesto vs Testosterone Cypi[INVESTIGATOR_98795]. Subjects will be enrolled in the study based on selection criteria designed to represent 
the general population of hypogonadal men while minimizing risk to study participants. 
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled to meet scientific and regulatory objectives. After 
meeting the selection criteria, the subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio such that 90 
subjects will receive Natesto and 90 subjects will receive Testosterone Cypi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (200mg) one 
every two weeks and be followed for [ADDRESS_108681]’s medical 
history will be collected and documented and a physical examination will be performed. 
Previous blood test results will be reviewed including a general chemistry panel and Testosterone 
levels during chart review.
Subjects will sign an informed consent and in case they meet all inclusion criteria (and do not meet 
any exclusion criteria), they will be recruited to the study.

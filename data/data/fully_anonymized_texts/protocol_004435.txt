Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (Intra-Articular) Tranexamic Acid and Transfusion Rates Following Hip Hemiarthroplasty
Version 1.2 12. Background
Packed red blood cell transfusion is associated with the risk of infection (HIV, hepatitis B virus, 
hepatitis C virus, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, bacteria), 
immunosuppression, hemolysis, fever, urticaria, allergic reaction, and even death [1].  In addition to 
these risks, packed red blood cell transfusion increases hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64548].  At UCHC, one unit of packed red blood cells typi[INVESTIGATOR_64549] $300-400, but may 
cost as much as $1,000.  Because of these risks and costs, investigators have sought methods to decrease 
the need for packed red blood cell transfusion including the use of tranexamic acid.  
Tranexamic acid is a derivative of the amino acid lysine.  This drug works to decrease blood loss 
through its interaction with fibrin.  The drug competitively and reversibly binds to the lysine binding 
sites of fibrin.  This prevents plasminogen and its enzymatically active form, plasmin, from binding to 
fibrin.  By [CONTACT_64597]/plasmin from binding fibrin, tranexamic acid prevents enzymatic 
degradation of the fibrin clot.  Tranexamic acid, therefore, stabilizes the fibrin clot by [CONTACT_64598]/coagulation toward coagulation leading to decreased blood loss.  The drug has a 
half-life of 1-2 hours [2].  At UCHC, one gram of tranexamic acid typi[INVESTIGATOR_64549] $40-41.
Intravenous tranexamic acid reduces blood loss and packed red blood cell transfusion 
requirements when used during surgery.   Yang et al. performed a meta-analysis of randomized control 
trials evaluating the use of tranexamic acid use in total knee arthroplasty.  Their analysis included 15 
randomized control trials comprised of 837 patients.  They found the mean difference in blood loss 
between the patients receiving tranexamic acid and those receiving placebo was -504.9 ml (95% CI, -
620.89 to -388.92 ml; p < 0.[ZIP_CODE]).  The number of packed red blood cell transfusions per patient was 
also significantly less in the patients receiving tranexamic acid (weighted mean difference -1.43 units; 
95% CI, -1.69 to -1.17 units; p < 0.[ZIP_CODE]) [3].  Henry et al. showed that tranexamic acid use in elective 
surgery reduced the need for packed red blood cell transfusion by 39% (RR 0.61; 95% CI, 0.53-0.70) in 
their review of 65 randomized control trials including 4842 patients.  This reduction corresponds with an 
absolute risk reduction of 18% (95% CI, -0.22 to -0.14) [4]. 
Intravenous tranexamic acid use has not been associated with increased incidence of 
complications.  Henry et al. evaluated the relative risk of complications with tranexamic acid use in the 
randomized control trials they reviewed.  Tranexamic acid use did not increase the relative risk of 
mortality (RR 0.60, 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.10) in 30 randomized control trials involving 2917 patients.  Use IRB Review

Version 1.2 2of the drug was not associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (RR 0.79, 95% CI, 0.41 to 
1.52)
 in 21 randomized control trials involving 2186 patients.  Tranexamic acid use was not associated 
with a statistically significant increase in stroke (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.07) in 18 randomized 
control trials including 2027 patients.  Use of the drug, also, was not associated with an increased risk 
for a deep vein thrombosis (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.43) in 23 randomized control trials including 
1472 patients.  Additionally, tranexamic acid use did not increase the relative risk for suffering a 
pulmonary embolism (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.99) in 14 randomized control trials including 1006 
patients.  Finally, tranexamic acid did not increase the relative risk of renal failure/dysfunction (RR 0.89, 
95% CI 0.33 to 2.37) in 9 randomized control trials including 912 patients [4].  Yang et al., also, 
demonstrated that tranexamic acid use was not associated with an increased risk of complications.  Use 
of the drug was not associated with an increased rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.75, 95% CI 
0.34 to 1.67; p = 0.48) in 13 randomized control trials including 722 patients or an increased rate of 
pulmonary embolism (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.33; p = 0.50) in 6 randomized control trials involving 
349 patients.  Additionally, tranexamic acid use did not alter the prothrombin time (mean difference -
0.04 seconds, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.24 seconds; p = 0.77) in 4 randomized control trials documenting this 
data or the activated partial thromboplastin time (mean difference 0.37 seconds, 95% CI, -0.56 to 1.29 
seconds; p = 0.44) in 5 randomized control trials [3].
Tranexamic acid can also be delivered topi[INVESTIGATOR_64550].  De Bonis et al. 
demonstrated that tranexamic, when delivered topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], was not detected in the blood stream of 24 
patients undergoing coronary artery by[CONTACT_4897] [5].  Giving the drug in this fashion both 
concentrates the drug at the desired location and diminishes or even prevents systemic absorption and 
therefore any potentially detrimental thrombotic complications.  Ker et al. demonstrated that topi[INVESTIGATOR_64551] 45% (RR 0.55; 95% 
CI, 0.46-0.65; p < 0.0001) and the risk of blood loss by 29% (RR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.69-0.72; p < 0.0001)

Version 1.2 3In the TRANX-K and TRANX-H studies, Alshryda et al. tested the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_64554].  The TRANX-K study was a 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial including 157 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty who 
received either 1-gram tranexamic acid diluted with 50 cc saline intra-articularly or a placebo.  With the 
use of the drug, they were able to reduce the risk of packed red blood cell transfusion from 16.7% to 
1.3%, representing an absolute risk reduction of 15.4%.  Use of the drug was associated with a decrease 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48255] 1.2 days (95% CI, 0.05 to 2.43 days; p = 0.041) and cost per patient by £333 (95% 
CI, £37 to £630; p = 0.028).  There were no significant differences between study groups with respect to 
complications, though the study was not powered to detect a difference [7].  The TRANX-H study was a 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial including 161 patients undergoing a primary total hip arthroplasty 
who received either 1 gram tranexamic acid diluted with 50 cc of saline intra-articularly or a placebo.  
With the use of tranexamic acid, they were able to reduce their packed red blood cell transfusion rate 
from 32.1% to 12.5%, representing an absolute risk reduction of 19.6%.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_64555] a decrease in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48255] 1.0 days (95% CI, -0.2 to 2.3 days; p = 0.109) and cost per 
patient by £305 (95% CI, £0 to £610; p = 0.05).  There were no significant differences between study 
groups with respect to complications, though the study was not powered to detect a difference [8].   
Seo et al. demonstrated that topi[INVESTIGATOR_64556] (IV) administration for preventing packed red blood cell transfusion in their randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial of 150 patients.  In this trial, 50 patients received tranexamic acid IV, 50 patients 
received tranexamic acid intra-articularly, and 50 patients received placebo.  Blood loss was 528 +/- 
227, 426 +/- 197, and 833 +/- 412 ml for the groups respectively with statistically significant inter-group 
differences (p < 0.001).  Packed red blood cell transfusion rates were 34%, 20%, and 94% (p < 0.001) 
respectively.  There were no statistically significant differences in complication rates [9].
Because topi[INVESTIGATOR_64557], we wish to study the use of this drug in patients 
undergoing hip hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture.  Femoral neck fractures are a pattern of hip 
fractures that predominantly occur in an elderly population.  The average age of patients sustaining a 
femoral neck fracture is 79 for women and 74.3 for men [10].  The incidence has been reported as 63.3 
per 100,000 person years in woman and 27.7 per 100,000 person years in men [11].
Femoral Neck fractures are associated with high rates of avascular necrosis of the femoral head 
due to disruption of the lateral epi[INVESTIGATOR_64558], a branch of the medial femoral circumflex artery which IRB Review

Version 1.[ADDRESS_69987] in a hemiarthroplasty, one might assume that a 
hemiarthroplasty is associated with less blood loss than a total hip replacement.   Van den Bekerom et al. 
showed that hemiarthroplasty was associated with decreased intra-operative blood loss compared with 
total hip arthroplasty.  In this study, 8 of 137 patients receiving hemiarthroplasty had an intra-operative 
blood loss greater than 500 cc, while 25 out of 115 patients receiving total hip arthroplasty had an intra-
operative blood loss greater than 500 cc [12]. 
Literature regarding packed red blood cell transfusion rates in patients receiving 
hemiarthroplasty is sparse.  Parker et al. reported a packed red blood cell transfusion amount of 0.39 
units per patient in a randomized clinical trial involving 223 patients receiving hemiarthroplasty [13].  
Kadar et al. reported that 270 out of 579 patients receiving hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture 
required a packed red blood cell transfusion for a rate of 46.6% [14].  Rogmark et al. demonstrated that 
85 of 103 (82.5%) patients receiving hemiarthroplasty for a femoral neck fracture required packed red 
blood cell transfusion.  Of these patients, 32 (31.1% of all hemiarthroplasty patients) required 3 or more 
units [15].
A literature review using Pubmed and the search terms “tranexamic acid” and 
“hemiarthroplasty” does not reveal any results.  Though we were unable to detect any prior studies in 
which tranexamic acid was used for hemiarthroplasty of the hip, this procedure is very similar to a total 
hip arthroplasty.  Though hemiarthroplasty is associated with less blood loss than a total hip 
arthroplasty, the patients receiving a hemiarthroplasty are typi[INVESTIGATOR_64559].  Therefore, these patients have a lower threshold to undergo packed red blood cell IRB Review

3. Hypotheses, aims and objectives:
Hypothesis:  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_64561] a statistically significant reduction in 
packed red blood cell transfusion requirements when administered to patients undergoing hip 
hemiarthroplasty in comparison to a placebo control.
Aims /  objectives:  The goal of the research is to demonstrate that topi[INVESTIGATOR_64562], 
thus improving patient safety and decreasing medical costs.  We will achieve this aim by [CONTACT_64599], packed red blood cell transfusion amounts, and overall medical 
cost per admission for both study arms.
4.  Study Design & Procedures:
Study  design:  Double Blinded, Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial
Screening Procedures and who will perform them: 
Patients will be screened  for eligibility when they are scheduled to undergo a hip 
hemiarthroplasty.  This cohort consists of patients who present to the emergency department with 
a femoral neck fracture requiring operative intervention. Screening will consist of a review of the 
patients’ medical history. Prior to screening, verbal consent will be obtained to allow the 
patient’s medical record to be reviewed to determine eligibility. Specifically, patients will be 
informed about the study by [CONTACT_64600]. If the patient is interested, permission for a member of the study 
team to review their medical record will be sought and documented in the medical record.  The 
information obtained during this screening is also obtained as part of the required work up for 
patients undergoing operative intervention. If a patient is deemed eligible, they will be offered IRB Review

only year, age, gender, and the reason for exclusion will be recorded on a formal screening log. 
For screen failures whose age is 90 or greater, the specific age will not be recorded but rather 
noted as “90+” on the screening log. The PI, Co-Investigator Michael O’Sullivan, or the 
orthopedic surgery resident that is on call during the time of admission will be a part of all 
screening procedures. Each year there is a resident who has one year dedicated to research 
between their post graduate year [ADDRESS_69988]. To ensure that all eligible patients are screened and if appropriate consented, orthopedic 
surgery residents who take call will be added to the IRB application as consenters following 
completion of the attached “Educational Plan For Consenters” as necessary. Only those residents 
with completed training who have been added to the study and have been approved by [CONTACT_64601].
Study  Procedures and who will perform them:
Prior to  the start of the study, a randomization schedule will be constructed with block 
randomization using web-based software. Patients will then be allocated to one of two groups: 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_64563] (saline). Group assignments will be concealed in opaque 
sealed envelopes with a numerical code of consecutive numbers reflecting patient enrollment.  
Envelopes will be stored with the pharmacy staff in charge of drug preparation. The pharmacy 
staff, which will have no patient contact, will remain un-blinded.  The pharmacy staff will 
maintain the master key identifying which patients received the study drug and which patients 
received the placebo.  Physicians, residents, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717], and patients will be blinded to group 
assignment. 
Eligible patients will  be offered study enrollment following the screening protocol documented 
above in the “Screening procedures and who will perform them” section.  The PI, Co-

Version 1.2 7Patients recruited  in the Emergency Department or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64565], upset about 
the circumstances that brought them there, confused by [CONTACT_64602], and 
frightened about what is going to come next.  In order to avoid exerting undue pressure on these 
patients, an “Educational Plan for Consenters” was developed.  This plan includes a PowerPoint 
presentation outlining ethics in research, guiding moral principles, and issues surrounding 
informed consent as well as two papers for each investigator to read prior to consenting patients.  
The first paper, provided by [CONTACT_64603], reviews how to treat people participating in research.  The second paper is a study 
appearing in the BMC journal of Medical Ethics in which the authors conducted a systematic 
review of randomized controlled trials testing interventions in an effort to analyze the informed 
consent processes.  This review provided the authors with a platform to discuss methods to 
improve the consent process, specifically patient understanding.  Together, these two papers and 
presentation highlight, among other things, the importance of recognizing the stressful situation 
patients may find themselves in when being approached for study participation.  They also 
provide strategies to monitor undue pressure on patients who may be especially vulnerable.  
Prior to becoming a consenter for the study, each investigator will read and review both papers 
and view the PowerPoint presentation.  Upon completion, the potential issues specific to this 
study (approaching patients with very recent hip fractures in the Emergency Department or on 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64566]) will be discussed with Mark Cote, who is not a 
consenter for this study.  A completion form will be kept on file for consenters.   
Informed consent for  study inclusion will be obtained after informed consent for the surgical 
procedure, a hip hemiarthroplasty, has been obtained.  In order to provide informed consent for 
the surgical procedure, a hip hemiarthroplasty, a patient must demonstrate understanding of their 
diagnosis, the proposed surgical procedure, the risks and benefits of this surgical procedure, the 
risks and benefits associated with alternative treatment modalities, and wish to undergo a hip 
hemiarthroplasty.  Informed consent for study inclusion will be sought from the patient following 
consent for their surgical procedure.  In some instances, informed consent for surgery is obtained 
from a legally authorized representative (LAR) because the patient is decisionally impaired.  If a 
patient is unable to provide his or her own consent for surgery and requires a legally authorized 
representative, we will obtain informed consent for study participation from this legally 
authorized representative (LAR) once we are able to obtain written proof of the LAR status.  In IRB Review

Version 1.2 8this scenario,  assent will be sought from the patients. Considering that decisionally impaired 
adults are part of the population to which the results of this study are intended to benefit, we do 
not want to exclude them based solely on their mental incapacity. There may be instances where 
a patient is able to consent for surgery but doesn't understand the research. If during the consent 
process there is any question regarding the patient's capability to understand the research and 
provide informed consent as evidence by [CONTACT_64604], a 
screening tool provided with this submission will be used to assess the patient's mental capacity. 
The University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC) is a 
tool for assessing decisional capacity for clinical research [22]. It was designed as an extension 
of a 3-item questionnaire to include a more comprehensive assessment of understanding, 
appreciation, and reasoning about protocol elements that are essential for obtaining informed 
consent. There are 10 items on the UBACC that ask the respondent to state main details of the 
study as well as elements and implications of participation. Each of the 10 items on the UBACC 
is scored as 2 (correct), 1 (some deviation from correct) and 0 (incorrect). A cut-off of 14.5 has 
been shown to discriminate between those who are and those who are not capable of providing 
consent when compared to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_64567]  [22].  For this study a cut-off of 16 
will be used to in an effort to ensure only those who are decisional capable are permitted to 
provide informed consent. A score of less than 16 will constitute a decisional impairment. In this 
instance (score less than 16), consent will be sought from the LAR and assent will be sought 
from the patient.  In order to be included in the study, decisionally impaired individuals must 
have a documented LAR who provides informed consent and the decisionally impaired 
individiual must provide assent.  If either of these circumstances is not met, the decisionally 
impaired individual will represent a screening failure.
Documentation of  LAR status is required before an individual can provide informed consent for 
a surgical intervention on a decisionally impaired individual under this designation.  If an LAR is 
unable to initially provide this documentation prior to the surgical intervention, the surgical 
intervention is delayed until the LAR can obtain this documentation.  If the LAR definitively 
cannot produce this documentation, then informed consent is sought from the patient’s “next of 
kin.”  If the “next of kin” provides informed consent for the surgical intervention for a 
decisionally impaired individual, this patient will be excluded from study enrollment and IRB Review

Version 1.2 9represent a  screening failure.  As such, documentation of LAR status will be readily obtainable 
because the orthopaedic service requires this documentation prior to surgical intervention.
The informed  consent process will occur either in the emergency department or on the inpatient 
floor.  The investigator will limit any outside distractions during this time (i.e. closing doors, 
turning off TVs, etc.).  The informed consent procedure will include a thorough review of the 
informed consent document.  If a patient or LAR is unable or unwilling to review this document 
for any reason, the informed consent process will terminate in accordance with the patient/LAR’s 
wishes and the patient will be excluded from the study.  The investigator will attempt to answer 
any question the patient or LAR may have regarding study inclusion.  If the investigator is 
unable to answer a particular question, this answer will be sought prior to patient enrollment.  If 
a particular question is unable to be answered, the investigator will convey this information 
truthfully.  
If an  LAR is required to provide informed consent, obtaining informed consent from the LAR 
and assent from the patient will occur in the patient’s room with both the patient and LAR 
present so that communication regarding the study is not withheld from the patient despi[INVESTIGATOR_64568].  If the LAR is not in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the LAR will be contact[CONTACT_64605] (e.g. by [CONTACT_648]).  If the LAR 
indicates that he or she is planning on coming to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64569], 
informed consent for study inclusion will be sought at this time so that a face-to-face consent 
process can occur.  If the LAR does not plan to come to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64570], the patient will not be eligible for 
study inclusion.     
Once informed  consent is obtained, the pharmacy will be contact[CONTACT_64606]. When the patient is brought to the operating room, the 
pharmacy staff will open the numerical envelope assigned for the specific patient. The patient 
will undergo a hip hemiarthroplasty, according to the standard of care for a displaced femoral 
neck fracture.  Surgical approach and implant selection will be left to the discretion of the 
attending surgeon.  The only difference associated with study participation is that prior to wound 
closure, either a resident performing the surgery or the attending physician will introduce 1 gram IRB Review

(0.9% NaCl) for a total volume of [ADDRESS_69989] of care. The 
length of inpatient stay following this procedure is approximately 3 to 4 days, however this may 
vary. Following discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], patients will follow up with the treating surgeon at 
two outpatient visits (one at approximately 2 weeks, a second at 4-6 weeks).  These visits are the 
regularly scheduled post-operative visits as part of routine care. The methods and types of data 
to be collected are described in the “Methods of Data Collection” section of this protocol.
Sample  size and justification:
A sample  size calculation was conducted to determine the number of patients needed to observe 
a difference in packed red blood cell transfusion rates. In the last two fiscal years at UCHC a hip 
hemiarthroplasty has been performed in 84 patients, 29 of which required packed red blood cell 
transfusions (34.5%). We queried the Health Care Utilization Project Database, a stratified 20% 
national sample of over 7,000,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64571] 1,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64572] 46 states, to estimate 
national rates of packed red blood cell transfusion. In this sample, 14,813 of 45,800 (32.3%) 
patients undergoing hip hemiarthroplasty in 2011 required a packed red blood cell transfusion. 
Given these numbers, we used a value for packed red blood cell transfusion rate of 35% for 
patients that receive placebo. The literature has shown packed red blood cell transfusion rates 
with use of the drug in an orthopedic setting in similar populations to range from 12.5% to 1%. 
Accordingly, we selected a packed red blood cell transfusion rate of 10% in patients receiving 
tranexamic acid.  A two group continuity corrected Chi square test with a 0.[ADDRESS_69990] 80% power to detect the difference between packed red blood cell IRB Review

(102 total).
Explain  on what basis it is reasonable to assume that the sample size will be obtained:
The number  of hip hemiarthroplasties performed annually has been increasing. In the last fiscal 
year, 49 hip hemiarthroplasties were performed at UCHC. With a 2-year study period and the 
possibility that the study may be extended to neighboring facilities (St. Francis Medical Center), 
it is reasonable to assume the sample size will be obtained. 
Subject  characteristics and justifications: 
oAge:   Over 55 years.
oEthnicity:   No restrictions.
oGender:  No restrictions.
oVulnerable Populations: 
This population includes patients  with fragility fractures. A small percentage of this 
group has decisional impairment and will require consent from a health care proxy for 
operative intervention. In these instances, the legally authorized representative (LAR) as 
determined by [CONTACT_64607]-appointed conservator or guardian, power of attorney 
for health care, or an individual designated as a health care representative, will provide 
consent if the patient is deemed eligible.  Documentation of the LAR status will kept on 
file. If the LAR cannot provide documentation, the patient will not be included in the 
study.  The process of obtaining consent is detailed in the “Study procedures and who 
will perform them” section of this protocol.
oOther  characteristics - (e.g. vulnerable populations; primary language etc.):  
If a  patient cannot speak English, they will be excluded from the study.

embolism, thrombophilia, and chronic renal failure will be excluded.  Patients with recent (i.e. 
within the past calendar year) or active coronary ischemia will be excluded.  Patients who have 
suffered a myocardial infarction, undergone percutaneous coronary intervention, undergone 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806], or undergone any revascularization procedure within the past 
calendar year will be excluded.  Patients with an active subarachnoid hemorrhage, acquired 
defective color vision, patients who sustained a pathological fracture (fracture through a 
neoplastic lesion), or patients who are pregnant will be excluded.  Finally, patients with a known 
allergy to tranexamic acid will be excluded.  
Therapeutics – Patients taking the following therapeutics will be excluded:
Warfarin
Dabigatran
Rivaroxaban

Warfarin requires  reversal prior to surgery. Because there are multiple methods to 
achieve reversal from the elevated INR associated with warfarin use, which have different 
impacts on potential intra-operative and post-operative blood loss, inclusion of this population is 
not feasible.  Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and api[INVESTIGATOR_64573].  Because these drugs are 
relatively new, there is controversy associated with surgical timing when patients are taking 
these medications.  Some providers elect to wait up to [ADDRESS_69991] dose, while others 
operate immediately.  There is no formal lab value that can monitor these drugs’ impact on 
coagulation. As such, we have excluded these drugs.
Patients on  anti-platelet medication (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], etc.) will be included in this 
study.  Please refer to the protocol attachment  “Anti-platelet Rationale” for a complete

application) and the Investigator Brochure and /or package insert must also be submitted if available. 
1.For  a clinical trial (e.g. a Phase I, II or III study), the use of the intervention must be fully described 
e.g., the treatment regimen for use of drugs, placebo, medical device etc.  Also  include plans for 
receipt of test article, storage, dispensing and reconciliation. : The intervention, the application of 
either 1 gram of tranexamic acid mixed with normal saline (0.9% NaCl) for a total volume of 50 cc 
or 50 cc of normal saline (0.9% NaCl) placebo, will occur intra-operatively just prior to wound 
closure.  One half, or 25 cc, of either the study drug or the saline placebo will be applied intra-
articularly.  The second half, or 25 cc, will be applied under the fascia.  When applying either the 
study drug or saline placebo, the resident performing the case or the attending surgeon will attempt 
to coat all exposed tissues with a thin layer of the aqueous solution.  This is a one-time dose.  
Provision of the study drug (Tranexamic acid or saline placebo) will be provided by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_64577]. The pharmacy is responsible for the storing and dispensing the study drug.
2.Provide  a description of known adverse events due to the intervention and the plan to deal with such 
adverse events (e.g. does reduction, removal of device, removal from trial.): The package insert for 
Tranexamic acid provides a section on known adverse reactions with injection of the drug. 
Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), allergic dermatitis, giddiness, and 
hypotension have been reported occasionally with intravenous injection. Worldwide post marketing 
reports include thromboembolic events (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral 
thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction) have been 
rarely reported. Convulsion, chromatopsia, and visual impairment have also been reported. However, 
due to the spontaneous nature of reporting of medical events and lack of controls the actual incidence 
and causal relationship of the drug and event cannot be determined.

Myocardial 
InfarctionThe 30-day incidence of myocardial infarction 
following hip hemiarthroplasty has been 
reported to be 1.9% in patients 65-84 years of 
age (790 in 41,770 patients) and 3.1% in 
patients  > 85 years of age (1101 in 35,321 
patients).  
Assuming a rate of 1.9% to 3.1% for 
myocardial infarction in this patient 
population, we would expect to see 1-2 
patients in the tranexamic acid subgroup (n = 
51) experience a myocardial infarction in the 
4-6 week period following the surgical 
intervention.  The occurrence of myocardial 
infarction in 3 patients (1 above the expected) 
in the tranexamic acid subgroup will be 
sufficient to stop the study for inter-group 
assessment. 
As with mortality, it is possible that the 
placebo
 subgroup will have a higher incidence 
of myocardial infarction. If 3 patients (1 above 
the expected) in the tranexamic acid subgroup 
experience a myocardial infarction and if [ADDRESS_70009] 
experienced a myocardial infarction, we will 
continue the study. In this instance, the study 
will either continue to completion or be 
stopped if at any point the number of 
myocardial infarction in the tranexamic 
subgroup exceeds that of the control.  
If 3  patients (1 above the expected) in the 
tranexamic acid subgroup experience a 
myocardial infarction and fewer than [ADDRESS_70010] experienced a 
myocardial infarction, the study will be 
stopped.The 30 day incidence of myocardial 
infarction is 1.9% in patients 65-84 
years of age and 3.1% in patients  
> 85 years of age.

Cerebrovascular 
Accident
 The 30-day incidence of cerebrovascular 
accident following hip hemiarthroplasty has 
been reported to range from 0.1% to 1.5%.  The 30 day incidence of stroke is 
0.1% in patients 65-84 years of age 
and 0.1% in patients  > 85 years of IRB Review

we
 would expect 0-1 patients in the tranexamic 
acid subgroup (n = 51) to experience a 
cerebrovascular accident in the 4-6 week 
period following their surgical intervention. 
The occurrence of cerebrovascular accident in 
2 patients in the tranexamic acid subgroup (1

Acute Renal

NecrosisThere is no literature regarding the prevalence

is mentioned as an adverse event that has been

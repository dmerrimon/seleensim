5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
Postoperative pain is usually treated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_513805] (e.g., vomiting and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]) —and yet over 80% of patients still experience 
inadequate pain relief.  A novel, non -pharmacologic anal gesic technique —percutaneous peripheral 
nerve stimulation (PNS) — holds extraordinary potential to greatly reduce or obviate opi[INVESTIGATOR_513806].  This technique involves 
inserting an insulated el ectric lead adjacent to a target nerve through a needle prior to surgery using 
ultrasound guidance.  Following surgery, a tiny electric current is delivered to the nerve resulting in 
potent pain control without any cognitive or adverse systemic side effect s whatsoever.  The electrical 
pulse generator (stimulator) is so small it is simply affixed to the patient’s skin.  The leads are already 
cleared by [CONTACT_513867] (postoperative) pain for up to 60 days; 
and, since percu taneous PNS may be provided on an outpatient basis, the technique holds the 
promise of providing potent analgesia outlasting the pain of surgery —in other words, the possibility of 
a painless, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free recovery following surgery.   We propose a multicente r, randomized, double -
masked, placebo -controll ed, parallel -arm clinical trial to determine the effect of percutaneous PNS on 
postoperative analgesia and opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965], as well as physical and emotional functioning, the 
development of chronic pain, an d ongoing quality of life.  This investigation has a strong potential to 
dramatically reduce or obviate postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_513807]; while concurrently improving analgesia, increasi ng the ability to 
function in daily life, decreasing the risk of transition from acute to chronic pain, and improving quality 
of life.

UG3 Planning Phase  
 
The initial UG3 feasibility study will be a randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled, parallel -arm, 
human subjects pi[INVESTIGATOR_513808]:  
 
Specific Aim 1 (UG3):  To determine the  feasibility  and optimize  the protocol of the Implementation 
Phase (UH3) multicenter clinical trial that will compar e percutaneous PNS with usual and 
customary opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -based analgesia following moderate -to-severely painful ambulatory surgery.  
 
Specific Aim 2 (UG3):  To estimate  the treatment effect  of percutaneous PNS on pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_513809] -to-severely painful ambulatory surgery compared with usual and 
customary opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -based analgesia.  This will allow determination of the required sample size  of 
the definitive multicenter clinical trial of the Implementation Phase (UH3).  
 
UH3 Implementation Pha se 
The primary Specific Aim of the trial is to determine the effect of percutaneous PNS on postoperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_513810] -to-severely -painful ambulatory surgery 
(under the usual conditions in which PNS will be applied, making this a “pragmatic trial”).  
Secondary Specific Aims are to determine the effect of percutaneous PNS on physical and 
emotional functi oning , chronic pain , and quality of life  following moderate -to-severe ly-painful 
ambulatory surgery.  
 
Hypothesis 1 (UH3) :  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_513811] 7 days 
following surgery with percutaneous PNS compared with usual  and customary analgesia.  
 
Hypothesis 2 (UH3):   Surgical pain will be decreased within the first 7 days following surgery with 
percutaneous PNS compared with usual and customary analgesia (measured with a Numeric 
Rating Scale).  
 
Hypothesis 3 (UH3) :   Physical and emotional  functioning  will be significantly improved in the 12 
months following ambulatory surgery with percutaneous PNS as compared with usual and 
customary analgesia (measured with the Brief Pain Inventory).  
 
Hypothesis 4  (UH3) :  The incidence and intensity of chronic pain  will be significantly decreased 6 and 12 
months following surgery with percutaneous PNS compared with usual and customary analgesia 
(measured with a Numeric Rating Scale).  
 
Hypothesis 5 (UH3) :  Quality of life  will be significantly increased in the 12 mon ths following surgery 
with percutaneous PNS as compared with usual and customary analgesia (measured with the 
World Health Organization Quality of Life -BREF Instrument).  
 
7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Background.  There are tens -of-millions of ambulatory surgical procedures performed in the United 
States annually.  Over 80% of patients experience inadequate pain relief following surgery with 
consequences for both individuals and society.  For patients, inadequate po stoperative analgesia

Page 3 results not only in suffering, but also an increased risk of comorbidity (e.g., perioperative myocardial 
infarction), inferior rehabilitation, and the transition from acute pain to persistent (“chronic”) post -
surgical pain [incidence:  10-50%].  Persistent post -surgical pain frequently results in decreased 
productivity and a strain on personal relationships, as well as an increased risk of depression, chronic 
low-back and joint pain, obesity, and accelerated onset of cardiovascular dise ase.  For society as a 
whole, inadequately -treated acute pain is a burden to the healthcare system, requiring increased 
healthcare provider time and the costs of readmission for ambulatory patients.  Furthermore, 
persistent post -surgical pain not only incr eases medical care costs, but decreases overall economic 
output:  the economic toll for chronic nonmalignant pain is over $[ADDRESS_665817] -surgical pain is a substantial problem, which i s intimately 
related to a reliance on perioperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_513812] —the foundation of postoperative analgesia for over 
a century.  Unfortunately, opi[INVESTIGATOR_513813].  Frequent systemic side effect s such as nausea, vomiting, and pruritus are irritants; but some 
effects may be fatal, such as cognitive impairment13 and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (with life -threatening 
hypoventilation requiring naloxone administration occurring in 1 of 333 patients).  And, even minor 
ambulatory surgical procedures can lead to chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], with significant negative 
consequences suc h as hyperalgesia, dependence and decreased quality of life.  
 
The toll of opi[INVESTIGATOR_513814].  In the last 20 
years the rate of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_513815], abuse, addiction, and 
overdose has multiplied 
dramatically ( Figure 1 ), with the 
overall economic cost of opi[INVESTIGATOR_513816] $[ADDRESS_665818] 20 
years.  In excess of 28,000 
deaths due to overdose occurred 
within the [LOCATION_002] in 2010, 
a 700% increase in less than 2  
decades.  Shockingly, 65 -80% of 
current heroin -dependent users 
began their addiction by [CONTACT_513868][INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
 
Considering 4-20% of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_513817] —almost 500-million  doses annually —the supply of oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_513818].  
Nearly 80% of abused oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_513819], with most obtained 
from a friend or relative.  Unused prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_513820] “young recreatio nal 
users do not have to venture outside their immediate social networks to find those who will sell or  Figure 1.   Rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_513821], unintentional 
overdose deaths, and addiction treatment admissions.1

Page 4 share pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].”  Indeed, it has been conclusively demonstrated that both the abuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_513822] a vailability.  
 
Wounded service members and Veterans have been disproportionately affected, given that 
addiction is especially common in populations with co -existing psychopathology  (e.g., 
depression, post -traumatic stress disorder).  Evidence of the latter may be found in the most -recent 
(2009) Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military 
Personnel Report.  Within the U.S. Armed Services, the most -commonly abused class of prescription 
drugs is opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],  with the incidenc e of prescription drug misuse increasing from 2% to 11% 
between [ADDRESS_665819] now describe as  
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].  The Department of Defense has prioritized non -addictive analgesic modalities for pain 
states that are currently treated primarily with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Thus, inadequately -controlled postoperative 
pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_289026]/abuse are significant chal lenges for Armed Services members, Veterans 
and their families.   A new treatment for postoperative pain is desperately needed to both improve 
analgesia and concurrently decrease dependence on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
 
 
One analgesic alternative —percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation ( PNS)—holds 
extraordinary promise to improve post -surgical analgesia while concurrently decreasing 
or obviating opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965]; and, all without any adverse systemic side effects.  
 
 
Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the analgesic effects of stimulation —also termed 
“neuromodulation ”, but Melzack and Wall’s “gate control theory” is the most common and accepted 
theory:  electric current stimulates large -diameter afferent peripheral nerves that subsequ ently 
interrupt communication (the “gate”) from small -diameter pain fibers to the central nervous system at 
the level of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  Neuromodulation has a long history —and demonstrated efficacy —in the 
management of chronic  pain using surgically impla nted spi[INVESTIGATOR_513823] . 
 
However, the application of neurostimulation to postoperative  pain states has been limited by [CONTACT_513869]:  conventional units typi[INVESTIGATOR_513824].  Stimulation with electrodes placed on the skin 
(transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, “TENS”) has been investigated pre viously to determine 
if it has the potential to avoid  these limitations.   However, activation of pain fibers in the skin greatly 
limit the degree of tolerated current that can be delivered by [CONTACT_513870] ‘ceiling’.  
 
To apply neurostimulation to treatment postoperative pain, optimally this modality should be 
administered without an open surgical incision.  Extremely small, insulated electrical leads have 
now been developed that permit relatively rapid percutaneous inse rtion through a needle , 
obviating the need for a surgical incision ( Figure 2 , following page; MicroLead, SPR Therapeutics, 
Cleveland, OH).1

magnified lead).
 
Using ultrasound to guide placement, a lead may be reliably inserted  
0.5-3.0 cm from a peripheral nerve using similar landmarks and 
accepted approaches as for peripheral nerve block or  
perineural catheter administration ( Figure 3 ). 
 
An external stimulator —so small that it may be directly adhered 
to the skin ( Figure 4 )—subsequently delivers a small electric 
current through the insulated lead to the target nerve.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Preliminary studies and pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].  We recently published [ADDRESS_665820] 
uses of percutaneous PNS to treat postoperative pain [funded, in part, by [CONTACT_4289] 1R44AG052196].1,2  
We used the novel leads described previously that were recently cleared by [CONTACT_48354] (FDA) to treat acute pain within the peripheral nervous system.  A total of 10

Page 6 individuals were included who experienced pain difficult to control with oral analgesics between 6 and 
97 days following total knee arthroplasty.  Using ultrasound guidance, a femoral and/or sciatic nerve 
electrical lead was inserted, depend ing on where the majority of pain originated (anterior vs. posterior 
knee, respectively).  Pain scores were recorded before and after the stimulator was activated.  Of 
these 10 subjects, 5 had complete resolution  of their pain, 4 experienced a 57 -67% decre ase, 
and 1 a 14% reduction (Figure 5).1,2 
 
   The significant analgesia demonstrated in these 10 subjects led 
our group to investigate the possibility of using PNS immediately 
following surgery.  Seven patients had femoral and sciatic nerve 
leads inserted using ultrasound guidance prior to undergoi ng 
total knee arthroplasty.3  A single -injection adductor canal nerve 
block was administered using a long -acting local anesthetic, and 
surgical anesthesia provided with a spi[INVESTIGATOR_246044].  The 
following morning stimulators were reconnected to the leads a nd 
current delivered continuously for up to 6 weeks.  Patients were 
discharged home with their leads in situ .  In 6 of 7 subjects 
(86%), the average of daily pain scores across the first 2 weeks 
was well controlled and mild (<4 on the 0 -10 Numeric Rating 
Scale for pain).  Of the 5 subjects with data on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], the 
median time to complete opi[INVESTIGATOR_513825] 8 days , 
with 100% of subjects opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free 1 month following surgery.   
This is a dramatic improvement compared with the typi[INVESTIGATOR_513826] 2 
months  (vs. 8 days), with a 1 -month opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -independence rate of 11-33% (vs. 100%) for patients 
having the same surgical procedure within the [LOCATION_002] . 
 
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -sparing potential of PNS for painful ambulatory surgery is illustr ated by [CONTACT_513871], 
following a hallux valgus repair (“bunionectomy”) —one of the most painful orthopedic procedures 
performed —reported only mild pain and required no opi[INVESTIGATOR_513827] (unpublished data).  Due 
to the ability to provide PNS in ambulatory patients and a treatment duration of up to 30 days, the 
PNS system outlasted the pain of surgery.  These remarkable results led our team to submit an 
application to the Department of Defense (FY16 Peer Reviewed Orthopaedic Research Program) to 
support a clinical trial investigating the use of percutaneous PNS to improve function and 
rehabilitation following orthopedic trauma  of the lower extremity using knee arthroplasty as a model.  
 
Significance.  In contrast to that submission and our previous work involving inpatient knee 
arthroplasty, the present application proposes applying percutaneous PNS to the most painful 
ambulator y surgical procedures to improve postoperative analgesia and dramatically reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_16443].  If successful, benefits of decreasing pain in the immediate postoperative period  
may lead to a plethora of patient benefits beyond simply decreasing suff ering and opi[INVESTIGATOR_16443], including decreasing pain -related interference in activities of daily living and greatly 
improving physical rehabilitation —in and of itself critical in maximizing long -term outcomes.  In 
addition, persistent post -surgical pai n is correlated with increased perioperative pain; and, therefore, 
maximizing postoperative analgesia may decrease the incidence of transition from acute to chronic 
pain [incidence:  10 -50%] , reduce pain -related interference in activities of daily living, and improve 
quality of life.  
 Figure 5.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_513828] 7 Moreover, greatly reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_513829], vomiting, and pruritus; but diminish the incidence and severity of cognitive 
impairment  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_513830] (with its associated mortality).  Crucially, if opi[INVESTIGATOR_513831] —or even eliminated —for the most painful ambulatory 
surgery, then opi[INVESTIGATOR_513832] a lower degree of pain.  It is imperative that novel, non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_513833]:  
 
• Tens -of-millions of ambulatory procedures are performed annually  
• The number of su rgical procedures is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades  
• Up to 20% of prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] —almost 500 -million doses annually —are diverted and 
abused  
• The abuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_513834]  
• Illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_513835]  
• U.S. military personnel, Veterans and their families are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_513872] 2% to 11% 
in the six year s leading to 2008, and this trend continues unabated.  
 
Ultrasound -guided percutaneous PNS has been used to treat chronic pain (e.g., phantom limb pain),[ADDRESS_665821] importantly —and in contrast to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] —it has no abuse/addiction 
potential, produces no adverse systemic side effects, and doe s not influence cognitive 
functioning whatsoever.4  Consequently, we propose an initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_513836]  (UG3) followed by 
a definitive randomized, triple -masked, placebo -controlled, parallel design, human subjects pragmatic 
clinical trial to determine the effect(s) of ultrasound -guided, percutaneous PNS on postoperative 
pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965], and functioning/q uality of life following painful ambulatory surgical 
procedures.

We propose a feasibility study  during the initial 2 -year Planning Phase [UG3] and multicenter, 
randomized, triple -masked (investigators, subjects, statisticians), placebo -controlled, parallel arm, 
human -subjects pragmatic clinical trial  period during the subsequent 4 -year Implementatio n Phase 
[UH3] to determine if ultrasound -guided percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) greatly 
reduces or obviates postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_513837] a concurrent increase in surgical pain.  
For the entire duration of the funding period we will comply with policies and practices developed by 
[CONTACT_513873] -DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory, and we will work with the 
Coordinating Center in providing relevant information and material.  We have included a diverse 
group of recruit ment sites that will provide a broad, representative patient sample of active duty 
military members, Veterans and their families.  Study participants will be recruited from 7 centers, 
including both U.S. military and Veterans Affairs medical centers within  a wide geographic range, 
providing a study sample with ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic diversity.

The study protocol and materials will be approved by [CONTACT_37330]’s Institutional Review Board; and, 
the investigation will be prospectively registered on the clinicaltrial.gov website.  The study will be 
overseen by a Data Safety Monitoring Board comprised  of two physicians familiar with the ethical 
conduct of clinical research and one biostatistician.  The DSMB will review enrollment, study data, 
protocol violations, adverse events, and oversee all aspects of the clinical trial.  
 
 
UG3 Planning Phase  
 
The initial UG3 feasibility study will be a randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled, parallel -
arm, human subjects pi[INVESTIGATOR_513808]:  
 
Specific Aim 1 (UG3):  To determine the  feasibility  and optimize  the protocol of the 
Implementation Phase (UH3) multicenter clinical trial that will compare percutaneous PNS with 
usual and customary opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -based analgesia following moderate -to-severely painful ambulatory 
surgery.  
 
Specific Aim 2 (UG3):  To estimate  the treatment effect  of percutaneous PNS on pain and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_174049] -to-severely painful ambulatory surgery compared with 
usual and customary opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -based analgesia.  This will allow determination of the required 
sample size  of the defin itive multicenter clinical trial of the Implementation Phase (UH3).  
 
Therefore, the protocol for the UG3 Planning Phase feasibility study and the UH3 Implementation 
Phase pragmatic trial will be identical, with the exception of any improvements determined by [CONTACT_513874]3 study.  
 
Enrollment.  Surgeons at each enrolling center will identify potential study subjects at preoperative 
patient visits.  Surgeons will be seeing patients as part of regular medical care, and therefore this 
protocol will adhere to Health Insurance Portability and Account ability Act (HIPAA) regulations.  
Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be presented with the study, and prospective 
study subjects desiring additional information will be required to give permission for a research 
coordinator to contact t hem to adhere to HIPAA requirements.  Research coordinators will review the 
study protocol in detail with interested prospective subjects; and, for subjects desiring participation, 
written, informed consent will be obtained prior to any measurements, data collection, and/or

For women of childbearing age with the possibility of pregnancy, a sample of urine will be collected 
before any study interventions to confirm a non -pregnant state [this is standard for the surgery 
regardless of study participation].  Study participation will require that women of childbearing age with 
the possibility of pregnancy use a birth co ntrol method, such as abstinence, diaphragm, condom or 
intrauterine device to prevent pregnancy until lead removal.  Anthropomorphic and demographic 
characteristics as well as baseline end points will be recorded/measured, including a pain score at 
the sur gical site using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS, 0 -10), sensory deficits (measured with von 
Frey filaments within the cutaneous distribution of the target nerve), and muscle strength (measured 
with a pressure transducer; Table 1).

Page 11 Lead insertion.  Insulated l eads 
will be inserted prior to peripheral 
nerve block administration.  The 
lead insertion sites will be 
cleansed with chlorhexidine 
gluconate and isopropyl alcohol, 
and a sterile, fenestrated drape 
applied.  A portable ultrasound  
paired with either a  linear or 
curved array transducer within a 
sterile sleeve will be used for 
lead insertion  (Figure 9 ).  The 
target nerve will be imaged in a 
transverse cross -sectional (short 
axis) view and a local anesthetic 
skin wheal raised lateral to the 
ultrasound transducer.  
 
A needle and a pre -loaded, 
monopolar, helically -coiled, insulated 
lead (SPR Therapeutics, Cleveland, OH) will be inserted.  Using an  in-plane ultrasound approach, t he 
needle tip will be advanced to approximately 1-2 cm from the target nerve.  The lead will be subsequently 
attached to an external stimulator (SPR Therapeuti cs), and a surface return electrode applied .  Accurate 
lead placement will be confirmed with subject reports of comfortable sensations over the surgical site 
without eliciting muscle contractions.  
 
Frequency will be set to 100 Hz, which is known to generate 
comfortable sensations and reduce pain compared to lower 
frequencies (2 -50 Hz).  Stimulus amplitude and pulse 
duration will be incre ased until the subject reports that 
comfortable sensations cover the surgical site (region in 
which pain is anticipated following surgery).  Stimulation 
parameters will be adjusted to improve stimulation coverage 
and comfort.  Once optimum parameters have been 
determined, the needle will be withdrawn over the lead.  The 
lead will be affixed to the skin with a sterile occlusive 
dressing ( Figures 4 and 10 ).  The stimulator will be set to 
deliver a range of currents .  During their treatment, subjects 
can control  these levels.   Muscle strength will again be tested 
with the stimulator set for the optimal setting.  The stimulator will 
be removed until after surgery.  
 
Preoperatively, day of surgery.  Subjects will contin ue to receive usual and customary local 
anesthetic -based analgesia.  Because percutaneous PNS does not induce a sensory block and 
therefore does not provide anesthesia for the surgical procedure itself, we will continue to provide 
subjects with a preoperat ive single -injection local anesthetic -based peripheral nerve block ( Table 1 ; 
30 mL of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:400,000).  In addition, surgeons will be permitted to 
infiltrate the surgical area with local anesthetic (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]).

Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_513875]  (Table 4 ) in a 1:1 ratio and 
in randomly chosen block sizes.  Randomization lists for each enrolling center will be created by [CONTACT_513876] .  Treatment group assignment will be conveyed to the enrolling sites via the same 
secure web -based system (RedCap) u sed to collect and collate all post -intervention endpoints (see 
“Data Collection” paragraph below) .  Stimulators are capable of programming to either (1) pass 
electrical current; or, (2) not pass electrical current.  Importantly, these 2 modes (active and sham) 
are indistinguishable in appearance, and therefore investigators, subjects, and all clinical staff will be 
masked to treatment group assignment, with the only exception being the unmas ked individual  who 
programs the stimulator  (and will not have direct contact [CONTACT_1155]) .  The unmasked personnel 
will have access to the randomization list on RedCap , program the stimulator appropriately (sham vs. 
active), and provide the individual  interacting with the study subject with the device  without indicating 
the treatment group . 
 
Subjects will be informed that often during postoperative active treatment with electrical current 
patients do not always have the sensations experienced during pr eoperative lead placement and 
once proper placement is confirmed with comfortable sensations, therapeutic levels of stimulation 
may be delivered sub -threshold (below the intensity required for sensation and still provide relief, 
which is factual/accurate).   This protocol will ensure a randomized, double/triple -masked, 
sham/placebo -controlled trial.   For the feasibility study (UG3), unmasking will occur 2 weeks 
following surgery to allow for protocol revisions, as necessary (“double masked” during data 
collection).  In contrast, for the definitive pragmatic clinical trial (UH3) unmasking will not occur until 
statistical analysis for the entire investigation is complete (termed “triple masked”).  
 
Intraoperative course.   The primary surgical anesthetic will be a general anesthetic, spi[INVESTIGATOR_367498] (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) or exclusively the preoperative single -injection peripheral nerve block.  
Anesthetics that are also analgesics such as ketamine will not be used:  the only permitted analgesic 
will be intravenous fentan yl, which will be minimal since all subjects will receive a single -injection 
peripheral nerve block immediately prior to surgery.  
 
Postoperative course.  Within the recovery room following surgery, the stimulators will be attached 
to the leads and activated, followed by [CONTACT_513877].   Subjects who had a spi[INVESTIGATOR_513838].  Operating and recovery room 
pharmacologic analgesic requirements will be recorded.

Page [ADDRESS_665823] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779].   Prior to discharge, subjects and their caretakers will be provided with verbal 
and written stimulator/lead instructions and the telephone and pager numbers of a local investigator 
available at all times.  Subjects will be discharged home with their leads in situ , and  contact[CONTACT_457] -
other day  by a healthcare provider  until lead removal.  Subjects will be also be discharged with a 
prescription for immediate -release oral oxycodone (5 mg tablets taken for breakthrough pain).  
Therefore, all patients of this study —regardless of the treatment arm they are randomized to —will 
continue to receive current usual and customary analgesia.  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_513878].  Lead removal will occur on postoperative day 14 (+/- 2 days) by [CONTACT_50902].   If the lead is removed following Day 14, the stimulator will b e turned off on Day 14  and 
removed subsequently .  Similar to perineural catheters,135 this procedure encompasses simply 
removing the occlusive dressing and gently pulling on the lead.  Following study completion, the 
results will be mailed electronically o r by [CONTACT_513879] -technical language.  
 
Outcome measurements (end points).  We have selected outcome measures that have 
established reliability and validity, with minimal inter -rater dis cordance, and are recommended for 
pain-related clinical trials by [CONTACT_513880], 
Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) consensus statement.136  
Importantly, nearly all outcome measures are common data elements from the National 
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).137  End points ( Table 2 ) will be evaluated 
at baseline (prior to surgery on postoperative day 0), during the treatment period (postoperative days 
1-14); and the follow -up period (postoperative day 15 and months 1, 4, and 12).

UG3 Milestones.  The 2 -year UG3 feasibility period has explicit milestones  (Table 3 , following page) 
that are feasible, quantifiable, and scientifically justified to allow an assessment of progress.  Each of 
the items listed in Table [ADDRESS_665827]  be 
completed in order to proceed to the 4 -year UH3 definitive, pragmatic clinical trial.  
 
Study Preparation.  Finalize protocol with the Steering Committee, Site Directors, Significant 
Contributors, and NIH -DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory. Finalize common and individual site 
case report forms (each enrolling site will require forms that conform to its own specific 
requirements).  In concert with the Principal Investigator, the Department of Outcomes Research 
(Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) will create the data -entry platform (dat abase) used to store all 
study -related information.  Equipment (e.g., electrical leads and stimulators) will be ordered for each 
enrolling center.  Research Coordinators will be hired and trained at all enrolling centers.  The 
Primary Investigator will vis it each of the enrolling centers to train both Site Directors and Research 
Coordinators in all aspects of the study .  In addition, a trained representative from the developer and 
manufacturer of the percutaneous PNS system (SPR Therapeutics) will travel to  each enrolling 
center to train Site Directors and Research Coordinators on how to insert and manage the leads and 
stimulators.  This will be done at the company’s expense, and conform to all HIPAA requirements.  
Training will continue with successive subj ects until both the representative and study personnel feel 
comfortable with the site’s future enrollment without further training.

Regulatory Review and Approval Process.  Of note, the entire first year of the funding period is 
currently designated for this purpose due to the often -prolonged period of time required for regulatory 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 16 review and approval.  However, enrollment may commence sooner if the regulatory process requires 
less than 1 year.  This is probable since the stimulation system used in the proposed investigation is 
already cleared for use in treating acute pain, and ther efore US FDA investigational device 
exemption approval is not needed and the proposed use in this study is on label.  The final protocol 
will be formatted and then submitted to all enrolling site IRBs and the funding agency’s oversight 
committee (e.g., U.S . Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Human Research Protection 
Office).  The DSMB will be initiated which will design the DSMB charter describing role, reporting 
procedures, and meeting protocol.  A Medical Monitor (DSMB Chair, “subject advocate”) will receive 
monthly reports prepared by [CONTACT_079] (reviews project accomplishments, issues, 
problems, upcoming goals, adverse events, protocol deviations, etc.).  DSMB will occur at a minimum 
of very 6 months, or more often if specified b y the DSMB charter .  The DSMB will review progress 
and recommends modification, continuation, or termination:  
 
• Approval of the trial protocol before enrollment  
• Review data in order to determine efficacy, futility, and safety, and to determine 
continuation  
• Review data quality and data integrity  
• Evaluate risk versus benefit by [CONTACT_143435]  
• Determine whether the trial is proceeding as planned, the protocol is being followed, the 
recruitment of patients is on s chedule, and data are being collected with the proper 
accuracy  
• Review patient dropouts, if any, and make appropriate recommendations  
• Determine whether safety concerns have been raised by [CONTACT_513883]  
• Modifications of the stu dy protocol based upon the review of the safety data  
• Suspension or early termination of the study or of one or more study arms because of 
serious concerns about patients' safety, inadequate performance, or rate of 
enrollment  
• Suspension or early termina tion of the study or of one or more study arms because study 
objectives have been obtained according to pre -established statistical guidelines  
• Optional approaches for executive committee and investigators to consider when the 
DSMB determines that the inc idence of the primary study outcomes is substantially 
less than expected, such as recommendations to increase the number of trial 
centers or extend the recruitment period  
• Corrective actions regarding a study center whose performance appears unsatisfactor y or 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_513840].  The study will be registered on clinicaltrials.gov prior to enrollment of the 
first subject, and be kept updated.  Research Coordinators will re -educate clinical contacts on ethical 
referral process and initiate the referral period.  For the initial subject at each enrolling center, a 
trained representative from the developer and manufacturer of the percutaneous PNS system (SPR 
Therapeutics) will travel to each enrolling center to train both Site Directors and Researc h 
Coordinators in how to insert and manage leads and stimulators.  For quality assurance, the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_513841]’s course, from referral to enrollment 
to lead insertion to medical follow -up and a dverse event or protocol deviation reporting.  
 
Enrollment.  The Research Coordinator or Site Director at each site will schedule lead insertions for 
that specific site.  Baseline and day -of-surgery (postoperative day 0) data collection will occur at each 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_665828] will be at 4 months following surgery (the 12-month time poin t will be 
used for the definitive UH3 pragmatic clinical trial).  Quality assurance will be ongoing by [CONTACT_513884], which will monitor data for sources of error and report to the 
Medical Monitor (DSMB Chair) with written monthly reports.  Each enrolling center will be expected to 
enroll at least [ADDRESS_665829] for each of the 3 possible lead locations (e.g., brachial plexus trunks) in each 
of the first two quarters of the 2nd year of the funding period.  Combined, the 7 centers will en roll a 
total of 64 subjects as part of the feasibility study.  
 
Preparation for the UH3 Clinical Trial.  If one or more centers fails to enroll their designated 
subjects —for whatever reason(s) —other centers will make up this enrollment with coordination by 
[CONTACT_079].  The [ADDRESS_665830] of the 
study design (such as the outcome measures or informed consent forms), including replacing any 
enrolling center that fails to demonstrate t he ability to adequately enroll and execute the protocol.  
The data from the first 64 subjects will be cleaned by [CONTACT_513885] a 
statistical analysis performed by [CONTACT_4305] (Edward Mascha, PhD) at the Department of 
Outcomes Research (Cleveland Clinic).  
 
In concert with the NIH -DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory Coordinating Center, the statistical 
section for the subsequent UH3 pragmatic clinical trial will be revised to reflect the estimated 
treatment effect  and tre atment group means.  For the initial submission, we have estimated the 
probable maximum sample size for budgeting and planning purposes; but, the results of the initial 
feasibility study will most -likely decrease the definitive UH3 pragmatic trial required  sample size.  The 
statistical section and budget will be revised to reflect any changes.  Any revisions to the protocol or 
informed consent forms will be submitted to the DSMB, individual center IRBs and funding center’s 
oversight body.  A manuscript with  the results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_513842].gov.  Lastly, a final UG3 period report will be 
prepared for the funding and oversight agencies.  
 
UG3 Planning Phase Specific Aims.  The investigation described above will accomplish the two 
Specific Aims of the UG3 Planning Phase:  
 
Specific Aim 1 (UG3):  To determine the  feasibility  and optimize  the protocol of the 
Implementation Phase (UH3) multicenter clinical trial that will compare percutaneous PNS with 
usual and customary opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -based analgesia following moderate -to-severely painful ambulatory 
surgery.  
 
Specific Aim 2 (UG3):  To estimate  the treatment effect  of percutaneous PNS on pain and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_174049] -to-severely painful ambulatory surgery compared with 
usual and customary opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -based analgesia.  This will allow determination of the required 
sample size  of the defin itive multicenter clinical trial of the Implementation Phase (UH3).  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_665831] of percutaneous PNS on postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_513843] -to-severely -painful ambulatory surgery (under the usual 
conditions in which PNS will  be applied, making this a “pragmatic trial”).  Secondary Specific Aims 
are to determine the effect of percutaneous PNS on physical and emotional functioning , chronic 
pain, and quality of life  following moderate -to-severely -painful ambulatory surgery.  The definitive 
UH3 pragmatic clinic trial will use the same protocol as the UG3 Planning Phase feasibility study 
described above, with the addition of any revisions determined necessary following that initial 
investigation.  We will work closely with the NIH -DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory 
Coordinating Center at all phases of the definitive pragmatic clinical trial, from preparation through 
data analysis and manuscript preparation.  
 
The primary end points will be cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_513844] 
(measured with a Numeric Rating Scale) within the first 7 days following surgery.  The 
primary analyses will compare the two treatment groups, one of which will receive active stimulation 
while the other will receive no stimulation.  
 
 
Hypothesis 1 (UH3) : Opi[INVESTIGATOR_513811] 7 days 
following surgery with percutaneous PNS compared with usual and customary 
analgesia.  
 
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_84703] [oxycodone 5 mg tablets] will be recorded at all time points ( Table 2 ), 
with the primary end point being the cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_513845] 0 -7 (see 
statistical section for further details).  
 
 
Hypothesis 2 (UH3):     Surgical pain will be decreased within the first 7 days following surgery with 
percutaneous PNS compared with usual and customary analgesia 
(measured with a Numeric Rating Scale) . 
 
 
Current/present, worst, least, and average pain at the surgical site will be assessed u sing a Numeric 
Rating Scale (NRS) as part of the Brief Pain Inventory (short form).  The Brief Pain Inventory is an 
approved NINDS common data elements Scale.  The use of single items (e.g., average pain) in 
addition to the composite score is supported by [CONTACT_513886].  The NRS will be recorded at all time points ( Table 2 ), with the primary end point 
being the mean value of the “average” pain scores for postoperative days 0 -7 (see statistical 
section for further details).  The NRS is a highly -sensitive measure of pain intensity with numbers 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_665832] consensus recommendat ions 
for use of the 10 -point NRS of pain intensity for pain trials.  
 
An additional instrument, the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), will be utilized at 
various time points  following surgery.  The DVPRS was developed specifically for —and subsequently 
validated in —active duty military and Veteran patient popula tions.   Unfortunately, this new instrument 
has not been validated for repeated measures, and therefore will not be used as a primary end point 
for the current investigation.   However, future pain -related investigations involving military personnel 
and Ve terans will undoubtedly use the DVPRS, and we want the results of the current study to be 
comparable.  Therefore, we will use the DVPRS as a secondary end point at various time points (not 
all to lessen the questionnaire burden on subjects).  
 
Primary end p oint:  In order to claim that percutaneous PNS is superior to usual and customary 
analgesia, at least one of Hypotheses [ADDRESS_665833] noninferior.  
 
 
Hypothesis 3 (UH3) :   Physical and emotional  functioning  will be significantly improved in the 12 
months following ambulatory surgery with percutaneous PNS as compared 
with usual and customary analgesia (measured with the Brief Pain Inventory).  
 
 
The Brief Pain Inventory (short form) is an instrument specifically designed to assess pain and its 
impact on physical and emotional functioning.  It has established reliability and validity, with minimal 
inter-rater discordance, is recommended by [CONTACT_7902], Measurement, and Pain 
Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) consensus statement, and is an approved NINDS common 
data elements Scale.  The Brief Pain Inventory is comprised of three domains:  (1) pain,  with four 
questions involving “worst”, “average”, “least”, and “current” pain  levels using a 0 -10 NRS; (2) 
percentage of relief  provided by [CONTACT_513887] [reported score is the percentage 
divided by 10 and then subtracted from 10:  0 = complete relief, 10 = no relief]; and, (3) interference 
with 7 questions invo lving physical and emotional functioning using a 0 -10 Likert scale [0 = no 
interference; 10 = complete interference]:  general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, 
relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.  The use of both single items (e.g., average 
pain) and the composite score (0 = optimal; 120 = worst possible) is supported by [CONTACT_513888].   The Brief Pain Inventory has been used in 
countless clinical studies of chronic pain .   This instrument is associated with minimal subject burden 
and is easily interpreted by [CONTACT_143415].[ADDRESS_665834] 
reliability and correlates well with much longer questionnaires, including the McGill measures  and 
EuroQol.

Hypothesis 4 (UH3) :  The incidence and intensity of chronic pain  will be significantly decreased 6 
and 12 months following surgery with percutaneous PNS compared with usual 
and customary analgesia (measured with a Numeric Rating Scale).  
 
 
Current/present, worst, least, and average pain at the surgical site will be assessed using a 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) as part of the Brief Pain Inventory (short form).151  The use of single 
items (e.g., average pain) in addition to the composite score is supported by [CONTACT_513889] -Scale.  As described previously, the NRS i s a highly -sensitive measure of pain 
intensity with numbers ranging from [ADDRESS_665835] imaginable pain.  The NRS has been demonstrated to be a valid and reliable measure 
following analgesic interventions . 
 
 
 
Hypothesis 5 (UH3) :  Quality of life  will be significantly increased in the 12 months following 
surgery with percutaneous PNS as compared with usual and customary 
analgesia (measured with the World Health Organization Quality of Life -BREF 
Instrument).  
 
 
While the primary goal of postoperative analgesics is in providing pain control, the most important 
outcomes for post -surgical patients are measures of well -being.  These measures reflect the 
dimensions of health as they are conceptualized and valued by [CONTACT_164472].  While health -
related quality of life is a subjective concept, various instruments are available that convert health 
status into quantifiable values.  The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQoL) Instrument 
is speci fically designed to evaluate clinically important, patient -relevant changes in health -related 
quality of life. The WHOQoL -BREF was developed by [CONTACT_513890] 24  questions assessing 4 
dimensions:  (1) physical health, (2) psychological health, (3) social relationships, and (4) 
environment (e.g., participation in and opportunities for recreation).  In addition, two items are 
examined separately and involve individu als’ overall perception of both their quality of life and health.  
Each of the 26 questions is rated on a 0 -5 scale, and then summed to produce both a total score as 
well as domain -specific scores for more in depth analysis.  Domain scores are scaled in a positive 
direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life).  The mean score of items within each 
domain is used to calculate the domain score.  Mean scores are then converted to range between [ADDRESS_665836] burden and is available in both self - and interviewer -administered 
formats.  It has exceptional internal consistency, intra -rater (test -retest) reliability, construct validity, 
and discr iminant validity.

UH3 Milestones.  The 4 -year UH3 implementation period has explicit milestones that are feasible, 
quantifiable, and scientifically justified to allow an assessment of progress.  Annual milestones are 
listed below following the timeline (T able 4).  All milestones must  be completed in order to 
consider the UH3 definitive, pragmatic clinical trial successfully concluded.

who will remain completely independent of the investigative team and will be a strong 
subject advocate.  The Medical monitor will oversee volunteer rec ruitment, volunteer 
enrollment, data collection, data storage, data analysis, and will report any discrepancies or 
problems to the Institutional Review Boards of both the enrolling center and lead center 
(University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego), as well as the  Army Human Research Protections 
Office.  The Medical monitor will have the authority to stop the clinical trial at any time, and 
take any actions necessary to protect the safety and well -being of research volunteers until 
the Institutional Review Boards c an assess the situation(s).  In addition, the Medical monitor 
will review all adverse events and provide a written opi[INVESTIGATOR_513847], serious adverse events, and 
subject de aths.

Page 25 Statistical Plan and Data Analysis  
 
Randomized groups will be compared for balance on baseline characteristics using descriptive 
statistics and the standardized difference (i.e., difference in means or proportions divided by [CONTACT_513900]).    Absolute standardized differences larger than 0.[ADDRESS_665841] for noninferiority of PNS to usual care on e ach of the two outcomes using 1 -tailed 
noninferiority tests.  The noninferiority deltas will be 1 point (worse) in pain score and 20% higher in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].  Noninferiority will be assessed at the overall 0.05 significance level with no 
adjustment t o the significance criterion for testing two outcomes since noninferiority is required on 
both outcomes – i.e., an intersection union test.  A noninferiority delta of [ADDRESS_665842] 1.7 along a 10 -point NRS accurately identified patients who rated 
improvements as “much improved” or more, compared with those who perceived no change or 
worsening following analgesic intervention s.153,156,[ADDRESS_665843] for pain score will be derived from a 
linear mixed effects model with the outcom e of patient’s “average” pain score for each day, with fixed 
effects for intervention (PNS vs usual care) and time (days 1 through 7), and assuming an 
autoregressive correlation structure among and measurements on the same patient overtime. We will 
then te st for noninferiority with a one tailed t -test in which the numerator is the estimated treatment 
effect from the model minus the noninferiority delta (1), and the denominator is the standard error of 
the estimated treatment effect.  This method will yield results similar to comparing groups on the 
patient mean of these seven days, but is more flexible since it allows for missing data and also 
directly accounts for the correlation within patient.  The model also allows assessing the treatment by 
[CONTACT_513901], but this will most likely not be of interest.180,[ADDRESS_665844] of PNS versus usual care on 
the log transformed cumulative consumption through POD 7 using a simple linear regression model 
(equivalent to a t -test).  The estimated treatment effect (i.e., difference between groups) will then be 
used in a noninferio rity test with null and alternat ive hypotheses as:     H0:   µ1 – µ2  ≥  log(1.2) = 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 26 0.263 versus   HA:    µ1 – µ2  <   log(1.2) = 0.263, where µ1 and  µ2  are the means of log -
transformed opi[INVESTIGATOR_513849], respectively, and µ1 – µ2  is estimated by 
[CONTACT_513902] t (i.e., beta) for PNS versus usual care in the regression model.  The estimated 
treatment effect beta will also be an estimate of the ratio of geometric means for the two groups, 
assuming data for each group is log -normal with similar coefficient of varia tion between groups.  
 
In the planning phase, focus will be on the estimated confidence interval for the treatment effects and 
the variability of the outcomes.  
 
Secondary outcomes will be assessed using appropriate statistical methods.  We will use the t -test or 
Wilcoxon rank sum test for physical and functioning as measured by [CONTACT_7854] 
(Hypothesis 3), chi -square analyses and t -test of Wilcoxon rank sum test for incidence and intensity 
of chronic pain, respectively (Hypothesis 4), and Wilcox on rank sum for quality of life measure by [CONTACT_513903] -BREF Instrument.  
 
Subgroup analysis for gender and ethnicity.   There is little relevant prior experience with the study 
intervention in the patient population of the p roposed investigation, so it is not known whether either 
gender or ethnicity would interact with the treatment effect.  Therefore, in accord with the Human 
Subjects recommendations, we will assess the treatment effect of PNS on each outcome of interest 
within gender and ethnicity subgroups.  In addition, we will analyze each anatomic location to detect 
variations in treatment effect among the various lead insertion sites and types of surgical procedures.  
We will not require a significant interaction betwee n treatment effect and these factors, but will rather 
conduct the subgroup analyses for each level of sufficient size (n=30).  The subgroup analyses will 
be the same as those conducted on the entire sample, and so would be just as valid and unbiased.  
 
Plan ning Phase sample  size considerations.   The sample size for the planning phase of [ADDRESS_665845] interim 
analyses at each 25% of the planned enroll ment using a group sequential method with gamma 
spending function and gamma parameter of -4 (quite conservative) for efficacy and 0 (moderately 
aggressive) for futility ( Figure 14 ).  The probability of crossing a boundary for either efficacy (mainly) 
or futility at the first through fourth looks would be 0.10, 0.42, 0.80 and 1.0, respectively, assuming 
the alternative hypotheses were true.

Missing outcomes data will 
be summarized along with 
the etiology of the absence.  
While very little outcomes 
data is expe cted to be missing, all 
analyses will be intention to treat, and imputation of missing data using methods such an multiple 
imputation and last observation carried forward will therefore be utilized, based on the situation.  In a 
conservative analysis imput ation will involve the conservative approach of assigning the worst 
observed outcome to patients in intervention groups and best observed outcomes to those in control.  
 
Throughout, the significance level will be 0.05 for each hypothesis.  SAS statistical s oftware (Cary, 
NC) will be used for all analyses, and East 6.0 (Cytel, Inc. Cambridge, MA) for interim monitoring and 
sample size calculations.  
 
UH3 Implementation Phase sample size considerations.   Sample size parameters for the 
implementation phase will be derived from estimates in the planning phase.  The sample size 
calculations below are conservative in that we observed a coefficient of variation for opi[INVESTIGATOR_513853] 0.48, substantially better than the assumed 0.65 . It 
is thus quite possible that the actual sample size for the implementation phase will be smaller.  
 
Sample size for the full trial will be chosen to allow an overall 90% power at the 0.025 significance 
level (since 1 -tailed tests) to claim the intervent ion more effective than the control on postoperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_513854].  In our joint hypothesis testing on 
these two outcomes, we power the study to have overall 90% power to detect superiority on either 

 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_665846] 1 of the 2 outcomes.  For cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_513855] 3 our previous data 
had a coefficient of variation (CV) of 46% (mean (SD) of 28 (13) mg).  Conservatively assuming a 
coefficient of variation of 75% through 7 days,183 with a tot al N=[ADDRESS_665847] 90% power to 
detect a relative reduction of 20% in mean opi[INVESTIGATOR_513856] 0.025 significance level 
(0.0125 for each of the two 1 -tailed tests for superiority), adjusting for interim analyses (N=448 before 
adjustment f or interim analyses).  
 
This sample size will yield high power (>0.95%) to detect superiority based on the intervention group 
having [ADDRESS_665848] deviation of 2 points for mean of the “average” pain score for each patient.  
 
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
Inclusion criteria:   (1) Adult patients of at least 18 years of age; (2) with a planned single -injection 
peripheral nerve block for postoperative analgesia; and (3 ) undergoing  one of the following surgical 
procedures:  
a.  rotator cuff repair (shoulder)  
b.  anterior cruciate ligament repair with a patellar autograph (knee)  
c.  ankle arthrodesis or arthroplasty (ankle)  
d.  hallux valgus correction (“bunionectomy” of the foot)  
 
These procedures are the most painful surgeries commonly performed on an outpatient (ambulatory) 
basis for each of the anatomic locations (shoulder, knee, ankle, and foot), with postoperative pain 
requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_513857] 2 weeks.  
 
Exclusion criteria:  (1) chronic analgesic  use including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]  (daily use within the 2 weeks prior to 
surgery and duration of use > 4 weeks); (2) neuro -muscular deficit of the target nerve(s); (3) 
compromised immune system based on medical history (e.g., immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221789], radiation, se psis, infection), or other conditions that places the subject at increased risk; 
(4) implanted spi[INVESTIGATOR_55441], cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator, deep brain stimulator, or other 
implantable neurostimulator whose stimulus current pathway may overlap; (5) history of bleeding 
disorder; (6) antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_513858] a 
20-gauge insertion needle ; (7) allergy to skin -contact [CONTACT_129625] (occlusive dressings, bandages, tape 
etc.); (8) incarcera tion; (9) pregnancy; (1 0) chronic pain of greater than 3 months of any severity in an 
anatomic location  other than the surgical site ; (11) anxiety disorder; (12) history of substance abuse; or 
(13) inability to contact [CONTACT_513905] t period, and vice versa (e.g., lack of 
telephone access).  
 
Anticipated enrollment at UCSD will be 100 subjects and anticipated enrollment at all other centers will be 
600 subjects , for a total of 700 subjects . 
 
11. RECRUITMENT AND PROCEDURES PREPARATORY TO RESEARCH  
Enrollment.  Surgeons , anesthesiologists or their counterparts (e.g., CRNAs, PAs) at each enrolling 
center will identify potential study subjects at preoperative patient visits prior to a planned 
amputation.  Surgeons will be seeing patients as part of regular medical care, and therefore this 
protocol will adhere to Health Insurance Por tability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_665849] a waiver of consent for recruitment purposes.  We would scan the upcoming 
ambulatory surgery schedule (which we have access to being anesthesiologists —we use this 
schedule daily for medical purposes), identify patients having the types of surgical procedures 
specified for this study, look in their electronic records to determin e eligibility, and if eligible either call 
the potential subjects ourselves or provide the name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_10975] a research 
coordinator to contact [CONTACT_41907].  
 
1.  These procedures are minimal risk to the potential subjects as we are an esthesiologists who will 
be viewing these records even without study participation in preparation for surgery and 
postoperative analgesia planning.  There is no information that an anesthesiologist would not view 
regardless of the existence of the study.  
 
2.  A waiver of consent would not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the potential subjects as 
we are anesthesiologists who will be viewing these records even without study participation in 
preparation for surgery and postoperative analgesia planni ng.  There is no information that an 
anesthesiologist would not view regardless of the existence of the study.  
 
3.  This clinical trial could not be practicably carried out without the waiver because many relatively 
healthy ambulatory patients are not seen  in preop clinic; or, they are seen just [ADDRESS_665850] a partial waiver of HIPAA 
authori zation to be granted:  
 
1.  Identifiers will include the potential subject’s date of surgery, surgeon, name, phone number, and 
email address (to send ICF if patient is interested in participation).  This information will be recorded 
in hard -copy format and destroyed using a paper shredder (or in the locked UCSD PHI disposal 
stations) following contact [CONTACT_10970].  If the patient does not participate, then there will be no 
record of PHI whatsoever.  If the patient does participate, then PHI will be prot ected as described in 
#16 below.  
 
2.  This clinical trial could not be practicably carried out without the waiver because many relatively 
healthy ambulatory patients are not seen in preop clinic; or, they are seen just [ADDRESS_665851] enough time to do this the morning of surgery.  
 
3.  The privacy risk to individuals whose PHI will be used is minimal sin ce, as anesthesiologists at 
UCSD caring for ambulatory surgery patients, we use the surgery schedule daily in the normal 
course of our work caring for patients; and, we will not record any PHI other than date of surgery, 
surgeon, name, contact [CONTACT_31308] s, and email address —and, these will be destroyed following 
use.  The anticipated benefit to subjects is a chance of improving their postoperative pain control if 
they are randomized to active stimulation.

[CONTACT_15750]/email address after  use. 
 
 
Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be presented with the study, and prospective 
study subjects desiring additional information will be required to give permission for a research 
coordinator to contact [CONTACT_513906].  The study protocol will be reviewed 
with interested prospective subjects in detail; and, for subjects desiring participation, written, informed 
consent will be obtained prior to any measurements, data collection, and/or interventions.  The 
meth od of documenting consent will be using written informed consent forms approved by [CONTACT_258103].  
  
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
Once a  prospective subject contacts (or gives permission to be contact[CONTACT_426]) an investigator or 
research coordinator by [CONTACT_19381], they will be provided information on the study purpose 
and protocol, as well as have any questions answered.  Candidates w ho meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and desire study enrollment will be scheduled to arrive the day of surgery earlier 
than normal to allow for written informed consent and baseline instruments to be applied.  Written 
informed consent will be attained  prior to any measurements or procedures prior to surgery.  Each 
site director is responsible for ensuring that written, informed consent is obtained from every subject 
at their respective enrolling center.  Clinical research coordinators —also one for each  enrolling site —
will be specifically trained by [CONTACT_513907] -approved informed consent 
form.  When subjects present for surgery, research co ordinators will provide and attain written 
informed consent.  This will occur in private patient care areas, so that subjects may feel comfortable 
asking questions of the research coordinator.  If a subject desires —or if there is a question that a 
research  coordinator cannot answer —the site director will be called in by [CONTACT_513908].  
We do not foresee any issues relevant to the mental capacity of the potential human subjects.  
Written, informed cons ent will be attained prior to any study procedures or measurements; and, 
subjects will not receive procedure -related sedation until following the written, informed consent 
process is completed.  Subjects will be provided privacy and time for decision makin g both in the 
study description/explanation telephone call to the site director or research coordinator, as described 
above; and also the morning of the initial treatment using a private patient care area to again review 
the study, informed consent form, a nd answer any remaining questions.  As noted previously, 
subjects may speak with the site director by [CONTACT_174084]; and, will have access during and following the treatment(s) with cellular phone and pager  
numbers provided upon discharge.  
This study protocol has follow -up data -collection telephone calls a maximum of 1 year following the 
initial study treatment, so repeated informed consent following the initial consent is unnecessary, as 
opposed to multi -year, longer -term clinical trials.  Surrogate consent will not be accepted; therefore, if 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 31 human subjects cannot provide consent on their own, they will not be offered study enrollment.  
Consent by [CONTACT_28045]’s Legally Authorized Representative is unac ceptable for study enrollment.  
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
Patients can decline enrollment.  If they do so, they will still receive the standard -of-care 
postoperative analgesia.  
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
The procedures and devices used in this study are already 510k cleared by [CONTACT_513909]. However, there may be risks that are not 
yet known, and the incidences provided are all estimated with the exception of lead fracture.  
Potential risks include infection (<0.01% for up to 60 days of infusion),5 lead fracture ( 7.5%), lead 
dislodgement (<1%), nerve injury (<0.001%), bleeding (<0.01%), skin irritation (1 -5%), lead migration 
(<0.1%), increased surgical pain, and discomfort/pain on insertion and/or during stimulation (10%).  
In addition, there is the risk of loss of confidentiality.  The following study procedures will be done to 
maintain confidentiality of this study:  hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_513859]’s files.  Any digitized records containing personal health 
information will be stored as password -protected and encrypted files.  
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES  
The principle protection for participants and the true foundation for conducting a safe and effective 
clinical study is a well -trained and caring research staff.  The principle investigator of this proposal, 
[CONTACT_513918], is an experienced multicenter clin ical trial Principal Investigator [CONTACT_4490] a Master’s of 
Science Degree in Clinical Investigation that included multiple classes specifically addressing the 
ethical conduct of human subjects research.  [CONTACT_24713] has published special articles within peer -
reviewed journals specifically addressing this issue ( Ilfeld BM:  Informed consent for medical 
research: an ethical imperative. Reg Anesth Pain Med 2006; 31: 353 -7.  PMID: 16857555).  All study 
personnel will receive training in human subjects protection and co mpliance with the HIPAA 
regulations.  
 
Subjects will be given clear instructions to call an investigator with any questions or concerns 
regarding their study participation.  If a patient experiences an injury that is directly caused by [CONTACT_62315], only professional medical care that they receive at the medical center.  No other compensation 
is offered.  Any adverse events will be reported to the IRB using the standard adverse events 
reporting and upon continuing review (depending on severity, as defined by [CONTACT_1201]).  During 
stimulation, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_513910], and subjects will have a physicians’ 
pager and cellular phone numbers available to respond 24 hours/day and 7 days/week until the day 
following lead removal.  This proce dure has proven effective for ambulatory surgical patients with 
perineural local anesthetic infusions (continuous peripheral nerve blocks).  
 
Precautions and responses to possible specific adverse events:  
 
Infection:   Leads will be placed under sterile conditions as is standard -of-care for any percutaneous 
device insertion.  In addition, all patients having orthopedic surgical procedures receive perioperative 
antibiotics, which will further decrease any risk of infect ion.  Subjects will be called daily and asked 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 32 about signs and symptoms of lead infection.  Should a lead become infected, it will be removed and 
oral antibiotics prescribed.  
 
Lead fracture:  It remains unknown what leads to lead fracture in a small percent age of patients, and 
therefore we cannot take specific steps to minimize its occurrence other than removing the leads with 
continuous, gentle traction.  
 
Lead dislodgement and migration:  Leads include a small “anchor” at the distal end to help keep 
the lea d from withdrawing.  In addition, the leads are shaped as a helical coil, which means they 
“unravel” if pulled on outside of the skin —the tip of the lead is withdrawn only after the entire lead has 
uncoiled with traction.  Therefore, inadvertent dislodgeme nt and migration are extremely unlikely.  An 
occlusive dressing is used to affix the lead to the skin.  
 
Nerve injury:  Leads never intentionally come into contact [CONTACT_513911] —they are inserted 0.5 -2.0 
cm distant from the target nerve.  Therefore, a nerv e injury should —theoretically —only occur with 
accidental contact [CONTACT_513912].  The investigators are all specifically trained and have 
experience inserting perineural catheters using ultrasound guidance, which permits real -time 
visualization of t he insertion needle and target nerve.  
 
Bleeding:  Exclusion criteria include ongoing active anticoagulation and/or bleeding disorders to 
decrease the risk of bleeding.  During insertion, vessels are avoided with the use of real -time 
ultrasound guidance.  The investigators are all specifically trained and have experience inserting 
perineural catheters using ultrasound guidance.  
 
Discomfort:  Subjects will have a single -injection peripheral nerve block with long -acting local 
anesthetic prior to surgery and b e provided with a prescription for an oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] .  Therefore, if the 
electrical leads provide an inadequate degree of analgesia, subjects will take their oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
 
Confidentiality:  The risks to confidentiality are the release of names/ telephone num bers/ 
demographic data (e.g. weight, age, height), which will be minimized by [CONTACT_143434] -
protected computers and case report forms that will be stored in locked offices.  
 
The study will have a designated medical monitor, Steven Shafer, MD, who wil l remain completely 
independent of the investigative team and will be a strong subject advocate.  The Medical monitor will 
oversee volunteer recruitment, volunteer enrollment, data collection, data storage, data analysis, and 
will report any discrepancies or problems to the Institutional Review Boards of both the enrolling 
center and lead center (University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego), as well as the Army Human Research 
Protections Office.  The Medical monitor will have the authority to stop the clinical trial  at any time, 
and take any actions necessary to protect the safety and well -being of research volunteers until the 
Institutional Review Boards can assess the situation(s).  In addition, the Medical monitor will review 
all adverse events and provide a writt en opi[INVESTIGATOR_513860], serious adverse events, and subject deaths.  
 
The study Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be comprised of the Medical Monitor, a 
physician exper ienced in both clinical trial management and the ethical conduct of research ( Pamela 
Flood, MD ), and a statistician, also well -experienced in multicenter trials ( Jarrod Dalton , PhD).  All 
three of these individuals will be completely independent of the investigative team.  No member of 
the DSMB will have any financial, proprietary, professional, or other interests that may affect 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_665853] will perform the 
following functions:  
 
• Approval of the trial protocol before enrollment of patients  
• Review the data in order to determine efficacy, futility, and safety, and to determine whether the 
study should continue  
• Review data quality and data integrity  
• Evaluate risk versus benefit by [CONTACT_143435]  
• Determine whether the trial is p roceeding as planned, the protocol is being followed, the recruitment 
of patients is on schedule, and data are being collected with the proper accuracy  
• Review patient dropouts, if any, and make appropriate recommendations  
• Determine whether safety conce rns have been raised by [CONTACT_513913].  Items to be reviewed by [CONTACT_143437]:  
• Interim/cumulative data for evidence of study -related adverse events  
• Interim/cumulative data for evidence of efficacy according to pre-established statistical guidelines in 
the study protocol  
• Data quality, completeness, and timeliness  
• Performance of individual centers  
• Adequacy of compliance with goals for recruitment and retention, including those related to 
participation of wom en and minorities  
• Adherence to the protocol  
• Factors that might affect the study outcome or compromise the confidentiality of the trial data (such 
as protocol violations etc.)  
• Factors external to the study such as scientific or therapeutic development s that may impact 
participant safety or the ethics of the study  
 
Recommendations.  The DSMB will conclude each review with their recommendations to the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_143397] (at the University of [LOCATION_004] San 
Diego) as to whether the study should continue without change, be modified, or terminated. 
Recommendations regarding modification of the design and conduct of the study may include:  
• Modifications of the study protocol based upon the review of the safety data 
• Suspension or early termination of the study or of one or more study arms because of serious 
concerns about patients' safety, inadequate performance, or rate of enrollment  
• Suspension or early termination of the study or of one or more study arms b ecause study objectives 
have been obtained according to pre -established statistical guidelines  
• Optional approaches for executive committee and investigators to consider when the DSMB 
determines that the incidence of the primary study outcomes is substant ially less than expected, 
such as recommendations to increase the number of trial centers or extend the recruitment period  
• Corrective actions regarding a study center whose performance appears unsatisfactory or 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_513861] 34 Appropriate reports will be made  to the Institutional Review Boards at all enrolling centers and the 
executive committee, comprised of all co -investigators and site directors  
 
Patient Serious Adverse Event Reporting.  All unanticipated events and adverse events will be 
reported to the specific center’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), the primary supervising IRB 
(University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego), the study Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and the 
Army Human Research Protections Office.  The adverse event and unanticipated ev ent profile will be 
discussed at monthly executive committee video -conference meetings.  
 
Management of adverse events.  Adverse events for study -related injuries will be managed by [CONTACT_513914].  For a medical emergency that is potentia lly life -threatening, subjects will 
be instructed to dial [ADDRESS_665854] at the site’s emergency department.  
 
In the event of a study -related injury, the treatment in stitutions will provide medical care needed to 
treat those injuries without cost to study subjects.  The institutions will not provide any other form of 
compensation for study -related injuries.  This information is specified within the informed consent 
forms.  The forms also instruct subjects to contact [CONTACT_186616], the enrolling 
investigator, or the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_513862] (phone numbers provided 
for all entities).  In addition, active duty Unite d States Armed Forces service members who enrolled at 
a civilian institution who sustain a research -related injury may receive medical care at a military 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513863].  The informed consent form instruct active duty service members to 
contact [CONTACT_513915] ([LOCATION_003]MRMC) Office of the 
Staff Judge Advocate (legal office) for issues that are inadequately resolved (with phone number).  
 
 
16. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA  ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT  
Pre-ICF information.  The only information that will be recorded on hard -copy format before a 
subject provides written, informed consent is date of surgery, surgeon, name, contact [CONTACT_513916], and email address.  This information will be destroyed using a paper shredder (or in the 
locked UCSD PHI disposal stations) following contact [CONTACT_10970].  If the patient does not 
participate, then there will be no record of PHI whatsoever.  
Disposition of data.  The original, hard -copy signed informed consent forms and case report forms 
will be stored within the local site director’s locked office, where they will remain for at least [ADDRESS_665855] copi[INVESTIGATOR_143399].  Data will be uploaded and stored in 
one location: the central servers of Department of Outcomes Research at the Cleveland Clinic, a 
department dedicated completely to clinical research . This department has a full -time Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) programmer dedicated to developi[INVESTIGATOR_513864]. REDCap is a relational database for data entry and auditing. This 
is a web -based application designed exclusively to support data capture for research studies.  The 
Department of Outcomes Research at the Cleveland Clinic  web servers are encrypt ed and 
password -protected with multiple firewalls to the standards of the National Institutes of Health. Of 
note, the servers are backed up every night. In the case of a disk failure, only data written to the files 
since the last backup will be subject to loss and can be easily restored. Databases are protected 
through electronic measures using a multi -layered, but simple approach: all study related files will 
reside on the database server rather than on individual hard disk drives and the files will be pro tected 
by [CONTACT_143438]. User names will be password protected.  
The electronic data will remain within the Department of Outcomes Research  for [ADDRESS_665856]’s name, phone 
numbers, and study ID. This information will be transferred via a secure online system known as the 
Army Missile and Research, Development and Engineering Command Safe Access File Exchange 
System (AMRDEC SAFE). AMRDEC SAFE is a secure, password -protected, system that the military 
has approved, and requires, for the transfer of such data. Civilian centers may use this system if 
access is granted, or fax to a locked office with access restricted only to the UCSD study coordin ator 
and the PI.  
Sharing study results. Following study completion, all subjects will be provided with the study 
results in written form an d in language appropriate for non -medical individuals. In addition, the master 
dataset will be de -identified.  
 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Subjects might experience less postoperative pain than they otherwise would have without 
participation.  If so, they might require fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_513865] a lower risk of experiencing 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and pruritus.   They might have a lower risk of 
chronic pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], and mental/physical disability.  
 
18. RISK/BEN EFIT RATIO  
While there are risks involved in the insertion, use, and removal of percutaneous leads, they are 
relatively rare and not catastrophic when they do occur.  With its ease of insertion, prolonged 
duration of action, presumably lower risk of compl ications or side effects, and simple removal, 
neuromodulation has the very real possibility of replacing local anesthetic administration —the 
standard of care for the past 100 years —that would completely revolutionize postoperative analgesia, 
as we know it.  
 
19. EXPENSE TO PARTICIPANT  
There will be no additional costs to subjects  as a result of being in this study , other than any  
transportation costs and  parking charges for their return trip for lead removal .  If a subject is  injured as 
a direct result of participation in this research, the University of [LOCATION_004] will provide any medical care 
they need to treat those injuries. The University will not pr ovide any other form of compensation for an 
injury.  
 
20. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
There is no compensation for participation . 
 
21. PRIVILEGES/CERTIFICATIONS/LICENSES AND RESEARCH TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES  
Principal Investigator, Brian M. Ilfeld, MD, MS,  is a board -certified anesthesiologist with fellowship 
training in and [ADDRESS_665857]. Ilfeld will be responsible for the overall management of this study, as well as for the well-being of 
study subjects.  
 
Co-investigators, Rodney Gabriel, MD , MAS ; Matthew Swisher , MD; are board -certified 
anesthesiologists with fellowship training in and extensive experience with regional anesthesia and 
acute pain medicine.  All hold a license to practice medicine in [LOCATION_004] and have medical privileges 
at the UC Medical Centers.  All will help consent subjects, perform a history and physical exam, 
perform the treatment on subjects, and will follow subjects following their treatment.  
 
The study will be overseen a medical monitor, Steven Shafer, MD , of Stanford University, Stanford, 
[LOCATION_004] —in essence a study subject advocate.  As the former Editor -in-Chief of one of 
anesthesiology’s two highest -impact medical journals, a clinician, a nd a Federally -funded research 
himself, [CONTACT_513919] is thoroughly experienced in management of clinical trials, the ethical conduct of 
clinical research, the patient population under investigation, and Acute Pain Medicine interventions 
for postoperative ana lgesia .  As such, [CONTACT_513919] is a strong study subject advocate.  [CONTACT_513919] has 
extensive experience working on committees and authoring/editing peer -reviewed evidence -based 
publications, and will be an active member of the DSMB.  He has been, and will co ntinue to be, 
completely independent of the investigative team.  In addition, [CONTACT_513919] has no financial, 
proprietary, professional, or other interests that may affect impartial, independent decision -making by 
[CONTACT_4318]. Lastly, he has no vested interest i n the outcome of the research study.   [CONTACT_513919] will 
remain completely independent of the investigative team and will be a strong subject advocate.  The 
Medical monitor will oversee volunteer recruitment, volunteer enrollment, data collection, data 
storag e, data analysis, and will report any discrepancies or problems to the Institutional Review 
Boards of both the enrolling center and lead center (University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego), as well as 
the Army Human Research Protections Office.  The Medical monito r will have the authority to stop 
the clinical trial at any time, and take any actions necessary to protect the safety and well -being of 
research volunteers until the Institutional Review Boards can assess the situation(s).  In addition, the 
Medical monito r will review all adverse events and provide a written opi[INVESTIGATOR_513866], serious adverse 
events, and subject deaths.

IssueSummary of Change
Original 
Protocol, V1.0TBD Not applicable
Protocol V2.0 TBD Removal of Aims 2 and 3. The grant research plan was inclusive of Aims 1, 
2 and 3; however, it was decided that, because of the nature of the 
condition being studied in Aims 2 and 3 (i.e., adult atrial fibrillation), it would 
be more appropriate to submit Aims [ADDRESS_807839] the site PI (not research coordinator) verify eligibility on page 17. 
Typographical errors were corrected in Figure 2 and on page 14 
(completion of final treatment period is week 34 not week 32).  A rationale 
is now provided (page 17) for the exclusion of non-English speakers.
Protocol v3.0 5/15/2017 Changed “liberal SCD” to “modified SCD” throughout the protocol, 
consents, and study materials/figures. Added and removed some study 
measures. Edited wording on some measures to improve clarity. Updated 
inclusion/exclusion criteria based on parent/patient and clinician 
stakeholder feedback to ensure study integrity and better account for 
participant safety. Process for diet staging is now specified in the protocol. 
Removed suggestions for timing of returning stools samples to enable more 
flexibility in the collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_139484]. Altered the process for 
collecting and analyzing the food diaries to centralize the nutrient analysis 
and provide greater diet monitoring oversight from the study co-
investigators with expertise in the SCD (Suskind/Braly). Added a variable 
for data collection to track Vitamin D status per recommendations of DSMB. 
Edited Figure [ADDRESS_807840] a change in study process that will allow for 
education on both the A and B diet at enrollment. Refined the analytic plan 
related to the washout period and run-in period associated with the diet 
staging. Added multiple study documents that will be used for recruitment 
and diet resources. Updated consent forms to verify participant willingness 
to allow de-identified use of data in future studies. Expanded appendix to 
add: Eureka technology platform privacy statement provided in the app 
prior to patient use, another version of the study flyer, phone script, and a 
study letter. Added multiple study staff. Removed information about adding 
a study-specific Facebook group as there are no longer plans of perusing a 
study-specific Facebook group for this study.
Protocol v4.0 6/29/2017 Protocol: Added a signature [CONTACT_609292]. Modified Figure [ADDRESS_807841] more flexibility for study site staff in 
their timelines for collecting data from participants. Modified Figure 2 and 
added more specific language regarding how often participants need to be 
tracking data to continue in the study as well as more specific language 
about collection of stool samples and how that relates to continuation in the 
study.  Made stipend remuneration consistent with expectations of data 
collection. Revised Appendix C language to be consistent with protocol and 
consents (i.e., using “modified” instead of “liberalized”). Added parent 
versions of relevant questionnaires under Appendix C, D, and H.  
Developed new diet diary for Appendix F, replacing previous version which 
USING SINGLE SUBJECT (N-OF-1) DESIGNS TO ANSWER PATIENT-IDENTIFIED RESEARCH 
QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page ivis attached as a separate document. Added language throughout specifying 
that a participant can be seen by a physician or advanced care provider.
Consents: Added language in the assent and consent forms to be 
consistent with expectations regarding tracking of diet and sending in stool 
sample. Added in Master Consent and Site Consent to footer for tracking 
purposes in both assent and consent. Added a line about no compensation 
from CCHMC or PCORI for injury in consent. Added language in consent 
regarding standard rates that may apply for data usage or text messaging 
related to the study. Added “provider” in addition to doctor throughout 
consent and assent to be consistent with the protocol that a participant can 
be seen by [CONTACT_5640] a physician or advanced care provider throughout the 
study.
Protocol v4.1 9/12/2017 Minor clarifications to the modified SCD (removal of requirement for organic 
sweet potatoes, addition of a requirement for organic rice, addition of grade 
A maple syrup as an allowable food, and clarification of the 
minimum/maximum suggested serving amounts).  Adjustment of the diet 
staging to be less restrictive and to advance more quickly.  Modification of 
exclusion criteria to include those who are on another interventional study 
as the study procedures could affect the results of the individual N-of-1 
study if a participant is exposed to an intervention at different times in the 
N-of-1 protocol.  Addition of pregnancy and ≥7.5% weight loss as criteria for 
automatic withdrawal in order to ensure participant safety. Clarified adverse 
events procedures including specifying expected adverse events.  Updated 
Appendix G with results review. Updated 1 question in Appendix C in the 
expectation of benefit questionnaires for both patient and parent. In 
Appendix D, we reordered the weekly questionnaires moving all the parent 
questionnaires together. We did not change the wording of any of the 
questions. Updated the DSMB charter (Appendix M). Updated Appendix I-
added new study staff and reordered staff members. Removed a site that is 
no longer participating and added a new site that is. Other changes were 
cosmetic consistent with what is stated under Appendix I section below. 
Also added minor wording updates to Appendices J and B (SCD Summary 
and SCD Detailed Summary) to be consistent with the allowed foods in the 
protocol and the dates of the study. Make changes to Appendix B stages 
for the PRODUCE study to be consistent with the staging as it is described 
in the protocol. 
Assent: Added in “organic” rice, took out “organic” for sweet potatoes and 
added in “Grade A” for maple syrup. Consent:  Added in “organic” rice, took 
out “organic” for sweet potatoes and added in “Grade A” for maple syrup. 
Changed description of fistula. Added interventional study exclusion.
Protocol v4.2 11/27/2017 Protocol: Added changes about the timing of the diet diary being sent to the 
study site and communication between the site and participant around the 
diet diary. Added verbiage that a less than 5% weight loss is expected in 
the study and greater than that will be reported as an AE. Clarified wording 
around SPDCAI and PUCAI regarding when score needs to be obtained 
related to study enrollment, and clarified what qualifies as mild to moderate 
disease activity. Added information regarding NiMBAL book being used as 
compensation for the study. Changed “Increase in corticosteroids within 4 
weeks of screening…” to “within 4 weeks of enrollment”. Added more 
specific language regarding cocoa and cacao that can be used by 
[CONTACT_4317]. Updated version number and dates where necessary. Clarified 
patient symptom tracking. Added information about a video we may make 
and included the video script as an Appendix B. Clarified screening visit 
timing. Clarified information regarding the statistical methods in the study.

changes to Appendix L- Phonescript. All appendices are uploaded as 
separate documents.
Protocol v4.3 4/30/[ADDRESS_807842]. Added language in the Participation 
Selection and Withdrawal section clarifying that GI care providers will 
determine if a patient and their family’s treatment decisions may be 
informed by [CONTACT_403215]. Updated screenshots of the Eureka 
app in Appendix A. Added in that dietitian phone follow-up visits can also be 
done in-person, in-clinic.
Protocol v4.4 Added the clarifier “nonintentional” to “≥ 7.5% weight loss” in section 3.5.4 
Early Withdrawal of Participants to clarify that the ≥ 7.5% weight loss will 
only result in a participant’s early withdrawal if the weight loss was 
unintentional. Changed exclusion criteria from a BMI in the 10th percentile to 
the 5th percentile. Change inclusion criteria from “Past or present history of 
intra-abdominal abscess, fistula, stricturing CD, or ostomy” to “Currently or 
within the past 9 months has had an intra-abdominal abscess, fistula, 
stricturing CD, or ostomy” and added the exclusion criteria “Ever had history 
of full colectomy”.
Protocol v4.5 9/19/2018 Changed the inflammation criteria for the study: evidence of acute 
inflammation and/or elevated acute phase reactant as measured by [CONTACT_609260] 1.5 (formerly 2) times the upper limit of normal, Lactoferrin 1.5 
(formerly 2) times the upper limit of normal, CRP 1,15 (formerly 1.25) times 
the upper limit of normal, or ESR 1.15 (formerly 1.25) times the upper limit 
of normal (based on local reference ranges) obtained within 8 weeks of 
enrollment. 
Protocol v4.6 10/24/[ADDRESS_807843] to disseminate flyers already approved 
by [CONTACT_1201], as well as a newly created poster. Created a poster(s) to 
advertise study (Appendix O). Added a letter written by [CONTACT_609261] (Appendix P). Changed the 
baseline period from a minimum of 2 weeks to a minimum of 1 week. 
Changed the inclusion/exclusion criteria to include patients that are already 
on the SCD or modified SCD but are not compliant with the diet per the site 
dietitian or primary GI physician. Made edits to the statistical analysis plan. 
Changed the wording surrounding the standard of care visits to make only 
the first SOC visit necessary, the others are only if/as needed.

Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (SPCDAI) score of 15-45 or Pediatric 
Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score of 10-60 assessed within 3 
weeks of enrollment” from inclusion criteria and added “Severe disease 
activity as measured by a short Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index 
(SPCDAI) score of >45 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) 
score of >60 assessed within 3 weeks of enrollment” to the exclusion criteria. 
Changed inclusion criteria from 7-17 years to 7-18 years.
Protocol v4.8 2/18/19 Decreased the sample size from n=120 to n=50. Revised sample size 
calculation demonstrates adequate power at this smaller sample size. Edited 
the study timeline by [CONTACT_609262] (enrollment 
now ends 10/31/19). Increased the number of participating study sites from 
[ADDRESS_807844] by [CONTACT_648], video call or telemedicine.

Version: 5.2, January 29, 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page 132 Overall Study Introduction
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (Food and Drug Administration Title 
21 part 50, part 56 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable 
government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures. 
2.1 Overall Study Objectives
The overall study is designed to enable patients and clinicians to collaborate in using mobile 
heath (mHealth) technology supported N-of-1 trials to answer patient-generated research 
questions from two national patient powered research networks (PPRNs)—the 
ImproveCareNow (ICN) network of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the 
Health eHeart (HeH) network of adults with cardiovascular disease . By [CONTACT_2329] a common 
method to answer research questions from two very different PPRNs, this study will provide 
evidence in support of N - o f - 1 methods as an approach to advance personalized and 
patient-centered outcomes research. This protocol details the study being conducted in the 
ICN network only (Aim 1)
2.2 Overall Study Aims:
Aim 1:  Use a series of N-of-1 trials to determine the effectiveness of a specific carbohydrate 
diet (SCD) in reducing symptoms and inflammatory burden in patients with IBD versus a 
modified SCD at both the individual and population level.
Aim 2: Test the comparative effectiveness of N-of-1 trials versus data tracking alone to 
identify and eliminate individual-level triggers and reduce atrial fibrillation (AF) frequency and 
severity.
Aim 3:  Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of using N-of-1 methodology across 
diverse populations (pediatric IBD and adult AF) to answer different types of patient-initiated 
questions and provide meaningful data for all PPRN stakeholders.
This protocol details Aim 1 only (study being conducted in ICN).  The activities of Aim 
2 (study being conducted in HeH) and Aim 3 (N-of-1 Evaluation) are outlined in 
separate protocols.
3 Aim 1: PRODUCE Study  
3.1 Background
3.1.1 Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a debilitating condition that negatively impacts the 
health of children. IBD includes Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and affects 1.[ADDRESS_807854] of more than $1.[ADDRESS_807855] (N-OF-1) DESIGNS TO ANSWER PATIENT-IDENTIFIED RESEARCH 
QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, [ADDRESS_807856] improved, over 40% of 
patients still have frequent, troubling symptoms that negatively impact their health and daily 
functioning5-7. 
While IBD treatment has improved, evidence regarding the role of diet in managing IBD is lacking. 
The mainstays of IBD treatment have been anti-inflammatory, immunomodulators, and biologic 
medications, but specific types of nutritional therapy (formula based enteral nutrition)[ADDRESS_807857] of diet on IBD symptoms is high. 
Between 36%-50% of pediatric IBD patients use complementary and alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]11. Yet, 
studies of the efficacy of diet in treating and controlling IBD symptoms remain limited9. Preliminary 
data regarding the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) suggests that it may result in clinical benefit 
and improvement in inflammatory biomarkers10. The diet eliminates grains, including but not 
limited to wheat, barley, corn and rice, sugars except honey, and limits milk products except fully 
fermented yogurt and aged cheeses (>30 days)12. Several small retrospective and prospective 
studies conducted by a study co-investigator (David Suskind) suggest improvement in clinical 
symptoms and inflammatory markers within 2-[ADDRESS_807858] another viable therapy.
3.1.2 A Critical Research Gap 
The role of diet in managing IBD is important to ICN patients and families. To identify research 
questions important to the community, ICN used a formal research prioritization process that 
engaged all stakeholders. Participating clinicians, parents, and patients were identified through 
listservs, social media, community meetings, monthly newsletters, and emails from network 
leaders. Respondents (94 clinicians and 116 parents/patients) identified [ADDRESS_807859]. An expert stakeholder panel classified the questions using the taxonomy of the James 
Lind Alliance14 and eliminated redundancies and topi[INVESTIGATOR_609232]14.  Sixty-two 
network stakeholders, including parents, clinicians, and researchers, subsequently rated these 
learning objectives at ICN’s biannual Community Conference. We identified the subset of 
questions amenable to N-of-[ADDRESS_807860] mild to moderate disease activity despi[INVESTIGATOR_609233]. A 
preliminary analysis of our ICN registry found that >2,000 (20%) patients on stable medication

QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, [ADDRESS_807861] in the ImproveCareNow (ICN) Learning Network whose mission is to 
transform the health, care and costs for all children and adolescents with IBD by [CONTACT_609264], families, clinicians and researchers to work together to accelerate innovation, 
discovery and application of new knowledge15.  ICN’s organizational structure ensures that all 
stakeholders are engaged in its governance. A major advantage of conducting this trial within 
ICN is that infrastructure has been optimized to support all components of this study – 
screening, enrollment, follow-up, and data collection/management. The study will take 
advantage of the ICN registry that contains standardized, IBD-specific data from >15,[ADDRESS_807862] consented for research. ICN represents an ideal setting for this diet trial 
because: (1) a collaborative network of highly engaged providers, researchers, patients, and 
caregivers has already been established; (2) the network is large and diverse, so results are 
likely to be generalizable; and (3) mechanisms of patient identification, follow-up, and data 
collection (including measurement of several study outcomes) are already built into routine 
clinical care.
3.2 Study Objective
Use a series of N-of-1 trials to determine the effectiveness of a specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) 
in reducing symptoms and inflammatory burden in patients with CD and UC versus a modified 
SCD at both the individual and population level.
3.3 Study Design
3.3.1 Basic PRODUCE Study Design:
This study will employ a series of individual N-of-1 trials that compare the SCD to a modified SCD 
using a collaborative approach between patients, parents, and their clinical team. Patients will 
enter the study on a usual (non-SCD) diet and will have a minimum 1-week run in period for diet 
planning and baseline data collection before beginning their assigned treatment.  Treatment 
periods will be assigned in blocks of two (e.g., AB) with the goal of each patient completing two 
balanced treatment blocks (e.g., ABAB) where treatment ‘A’ represents SCD and treatment ‘B’ 
represents modified SCD. Patients will be randomized to either the SCD or modified SCD as their 
starting intervention and alternate between these two conditions for four 8-week treatment 
periods.  The study design is summarized in Figure 1.

Version: 5.2, January 29, [ADDRESS_807863] a personalized answer regarding the 
comparative effectiveness between a highly restrictive diet (SCD) and a more broadly sustainable 
middle ground option (modified SCD) as compared to their baseline diet. In addition, we will 
aggregate the results of the completed N-of-1 trials across all patients to estimate the population 
level comparative effectiveness of these dietary treatments and the effectiveness of each 
compared to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], non-SCD, diet. As there is uncertainty regarding whether the sequencing 
of the intervention is important (e.g., whether patients must initiate a full SCD diet before modifying 
the diet to be less restrictive), we opted to randomize the initial treatment to be able to examine 
whether effects differ based on the initial diet type. Although using an ABAB/BABA design without 
randomization of treatment periods may result in patients anticipating their next intervention 
period, we do not believe this will result in increased dropout rates or failure to complete all 
treatment periods because patients and parent stakeholders expressed that they are interested 
in testing both diets—those who improve on SCD will be interested in determining whether they 
can maintain improvements on the modified SCD and those who improved on the liberal SCD will 
be interested in determining whether they can achieve greater improvements on a more strict 
SCD. The rationale for the duration of each treatment period (8-weeks) was based on the concern 
that patients would be unlikely to stay on a diet for more than 8 weeks if they did not observe a 
benefit and based on information from Breaking the Vicious Cycle and preliminary studies from 
research co-investigators indicating the symptoms improve within ~1 month and markers of 
inflammation by 2 months.
3.3.2 Technology Platform Configuration 
Study participants will use the Eureka N-of-1 platform (website and mobile app) to execute the 
research proposed in this study.  The Eureka N-of-[ADDRESS_807864] outcome data, track intervention/exposure status, and review collected data 
in real time. Upon trial completion, Eureka will present N-of-[ADDRESS_807865] (N-OF-1) DESIGNS TO ANSWER PATIENT-IDENTIFIED RESEARCH 
QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page 17intervention.  Eureka will configure a study-specific version of the platform to execute the 
research proposed in this study. Screen shots of the Eureka app are provided in Appendix A.
The Eureka Research Platform is a digital research platform developed at the University of 
[LOCATION_004] San Francisco as part of a cooperative agreement with the National Institutes of Health. 
The purpose of the platform is to facilitate mobile health research for any interested investigator. 
The Eureka platform includes a participant-facing “front end,” with mobile app and web-based 
interfaces, an investigator portal, and a secure “back end” for data storage and analyses. The 
platform is designed as an all-inclusive, configurable, easily-scalable research platform, inclusive 
of all aspects of research—from participant enrollment, onboarding and consent, to multi-modal 
data collection, study administration/management, and data extraction.  The platform’s front end 
can be customized by [CONTACT_609265]. Existing 
functionality includes the ability to obtain remote consent (although in-person consent can also 
be used), deploy participant surveys, message participants via push notifications, texts, or emails, 
integrate with external apps, sensors, and Bluetooth enabled devices, and capture data collected 
from smartphones (such as geolocation data or accelerometer/ activity data). The investigator 
portal provides a secure website wherein investigators, coordinators or other individuals with 
appropriate permissions can visualize relevant participants’ data and study status. The back end 
of the Eureka platform is a multi-tenant system that enables data collection, management and 
storage derived from multiple sources and from studies of various forms. This architecture rests 
on a secure and HIPAA-compliant Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud with the capacity to curate 
dense data from more than 1 million participants. In addition to providing data as needed to 
investigators, the infrastructure houses a de-identified data repository that is publicly available to 
help fulfill the general mission of advancing science and wellness. 
As part of design sessions held prior to enrollment, members of the research team including 
patients, parents, and clinicians will provide input regarding the study-specific configurations of 
the Eureka platform. Study specific configurations will include: (1) trial specific onboarding page, 
(2) code to generate and perform analyses of trials based on a trial-specific template, (3) server 
workflow that automates execution of the personal trials, and (4) customization of the user 
interface for prompts, reminders, forms, surveys, and visualizations. Final configurations will 
depend on input from key stakeholders. Technology modifications will be done via iterative, rapid 
development and testing cycles 
3.3.3 Interventions and Comparators
The diets are defined as follows: 
1. Usual Diet (Baseline Condition): Patient eats a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], non-SCD, diet. Diet may include some 
restrictions (which is common in IBD) such as seeds/nuts or gluten, but exclusions will not be 
as broad as with the SCD and Modified SCD (e.g., patient still eating grains and/or dairy).  
May include full or partial exclusive enteral nutrition as the currently available liquid 
supplements are not SCD compatible.  
2. Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD): The dietary program will follow recommendations outlined 
in Breaking the Vicious Cycle by [CONTACT_609266]12. Allowed foods include meat/fish/poultry, 
eggs, some legumes (e.g., lentils and split peas are permitted, chickpeas and soybeans are 
not), fully fermented yogurt, non-starchy vegetables, ripe fruit, nuts/seeds, honey and nut 
flours (e.g. almond flour or coconut flour).  SCD compatible vitamins are allowed and will be 
recommended on as needed basis by [CONTACT_609267]. Restricted foods include all grains, milk 
USING SINGLE SUBJECT (N-OF-1) DESIGNS TO ANSWER PATIENT-IDENTIFIED RESEARCH 
QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page 18products aside from 24-hour fermented SCD yogurt and cheeses aged greater than 30 days, 
starchy vegetables, processed foods with food additives and sweeteners other than honey.16
3.Modified Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD):  A more liberal, and thus, perhaps more 
sustainable version of the SCD.  In addition to the foods in the SCD, allowed foods will expand 
to include organic rice, oats, sweet potatoes, Grade A maple syrup and 100% unsweetened 
cocoa powder (not Dutch processed) or 100% cacao powder, nibs, or butter (no sugar added) 
for this group.  For oats, organic rice, and sweet potatoes, patients will be instructed to 
consume a minimum of [ADDRESS_807866] more than 2 servings of any 
combination of these items.  A serving size is 1 cup.  For maple syrup and 100% unsweetened 
cocoa powder (not Dutch processed) or 100% cacao powder, nibs, or butter (no sugar added), 
patients will be asked to consume a minimum of 2 Tablespoons of each item per week and a 
maximum of ½ cup of each per week.  The reasons for the minimum amount of these food 
items each week is to distinguish the diet from the SCD enough to provide a useful 
comparison.  Gluten, corn products, milk products (except yogurt and aged cheeses), 
sweeteners (except honey), and process foods will still be restricted.
3.4 Study Procedures 
Baseline evaluation: Study participants will complete a routine clinical assessment including 
disease activity measures and standard lab tests that assess inflammation and disease status 
(per center standard of care). Participants must have documented evidence of acute inflammation 
and/or elevated acute phase reactant as measured by [CONTACT_609268] 1.5 times the upper limit 
of normal, Lactoferrin 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, CRP 1.15 times the upper limit of normal, 
or ESR 1.15 times the upper limit of normal (based on local reference ranges) within 8 weeks of 
enrollment. Potential participants who are close to meeting one of the acute inflammation and/or 
elevated acute phase reactant markers and who meet all other study criteria will be considered 
for study participation on a case by [CONTACT_609269]’s primary gastroenterologist.  A stool sample for fecal calprotectin and banking for 
microbiome analysis will be collected by [CONTACT_609270]. A trained 
dietitian will provide 1:1 diet training and resources, including print and web-based materials 
(Appendix B). The dietitian will send the participant home with a 3-day diet recall to be returned 
to clinic (see process outlined in section on “Diet Monitoring”). In the event that the site dietitian 
is unavailable for the baseline training, it may be conducted by [CONTACT_609271] (i.e., Zoom, Skype) if permission is granted by [CONTACT_102]’s primary GI physician or 
advanced care provider.  Patients and parents will be trained in the use of the Eureka N-of-1 app. 
Participants will be randomized to either the SCD or modified SCD as their starting intervention 
with a 1:1 allocation ratio. We will utilize a centralized, stratified, block randomization approach. 
We will stratify within sites and by [CONTACT_55542] (UC/IC or CD).  Patients and parents will also 
complete psychological assessments and questions regarding their baseline expectation of 
benefit related to diet (see Table 1, Appendix C) via paper, tablet, website, or Eureka app at the 
baseline visit.  Following the baseline evaluation, participants will spend a minimum of 1 week 
(maximum of 4 weeks) collecting baseline data and preparing to begin their first assigned diet 
treatment. They will be asked to not change their diet until they begin their first treatment period. 
The baseline period is defined as the period from enrollment to the start of the N-of-1 trial (1- to a 
maximum of 4 weeks).
Diet Staging:  At the start of the initial diet treatment block (either SCD or modified SCD), 
participants will gradually transition from their usual diet to their initial diet intervention.  For

practitioner or physician’s assistant) at 2 ± [ADDRESS_807868] in-clinic, it is the 
site’s research staff’s responsibility to make sure that the patient’s weight is obtained using the 
same scale at every weigh in and that the patient reports the measured weight to the study staff. 
Participants will also have a phone or in-person follow-up with either their site’s dietitian or the 
site coordinating center dietitian in each treatment period. The dietitian will evaluate patient weight 
(on clinic scale at follow up visits and if available by [CONTACT_609273]) and nutritional intake.  S/he will 
prescribe SCD compatible nutritional supplements as needed based on review of the diet recall. 
In addition, at the clinic visits, follow up phone calls or visits, and during any other patient contact, 
the dietitian will carry out standard of care activities including, but not limited to, evaluating the 
participant’s nutrition and overall health, assessing the participants nutritional and dietary needs, 
providing diet advice, sharing sample meal plans, developi[INVESTIGATOR_609234], and sharing 
recipes from books, online resources, or other personal sources.  In the event that the site dietitian 
is unavailable for follow-up contact, these visits may be conducted by [CONTACT_609274] (i.e., Zoom, Skype) if permission is granted by [CONTACT_102]’s primary GI 
physician or advanced care provider.
Symptom tracking: Participants will use the Eureka N-of-1 mobile app to execute the N-of-1 
protocol, track treatment periods, and track daily and weekly symptoms and disease activity. 
Participants and their clinician will be able to visualize the tracked data in real-time via the Eureka 
N-of-1 app and on the web portal. Parents of participants will always track symptoms using the 
mobile app. Patients ≥[ADDRESS_807869] the option of tracking for themselves (in addition 
to their parent).  Patients < [ADDRESS_807870] parents track for them with child input. The questions 
to assess symptom and disease activity metrics are included in Appendix D.  Participants will be 
asked to start tracking at the baseline visit. Patients will be asked to complete a minimum of 2 
weeks of symptom tracking in the baseline period (14 daily measures, 3 weekly measures) and 
will be asked to continue with tracking once they initiate the N-of-1 Trial via the Eureka app.
Stool Collection: Participants will collect a home-based stool sample for fecal calprotectin analysis 
and biobanking for future analysis during the baseline period and the end of each treatment 
period.  Stool specimens will be accepted as early as up to [ADDRESS_807871] crossover (e.g., completion of baseline, Diet A1, and Diet 
B1) and terminate the protocol early may advance to the end of the study without additional stool 
collection. Patient instructions for stool collection are documented in Appendix E. Fecal

QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page 20calprotectin results will be made available to the clinicians as the results are returned from the 
lab.
Clinical Evaluations: Participants will be seen for clinic visits as needed throughout the study. 
Based on standard of care for initiating a new dietary intervention and the fact that patients 
enrolled in this study have mild or moderate disease activity, close follow up is recommended.  
Participants will have a follow up visit 8 ± [ADDRESS_807872] diet period and then 
as needed over the remainder of the study, with timing based on each individual center’s standard 
practice and patient need. This pragmatic design allows us to test the use of the N-of-1 
methodology for diet intervention as it would be delivered in regular clinical care. Data collected 
at routine clinic visits is standardized and includes weight, height, current medications, laboratory 
assessment, and disease activity (PUCAI and SPCDAI). This data is entered in the ICN registry.  
Assessment of Vitamin D levels is performed per local site standard of care.  This data is not 
collected in the ICN registry.  The date and results of all Vitamin D levels collected at regular 
clinical evaluations will be entered in the REDCap database by [CONTACT_609275].
Diet Monitoring: Patients will complete a 3-day diet diary at baseline and during each diet period, 
ideally around the mid-point of that period (approximately 3-5 weeks after transitioning to the new 
diet). The questions that will be used in the 3-day diet diary are included in Appendix F. The 
participant will return their completed diet diary to the local center dietitian or research coordinator 
via email/scan/text/mail. Once received from the patient and verified for completeness, the center 
dietitian or research coordinator will email the patient’s completed 3-day diet diary to the study’s 
central email at CCHMC and it will be triaged to approved research staff at Seattle Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_609235] a secure and IRB-approved email system. The research staff member at Seattle 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_609236] 3-day diet diary into a nutrient composition 
program. Output from the nutrition composition program (e.g., total calories, percent calories from 
fat, percent calories from carbohydrates, percent calories from protein, micronutrient composition) 
will be communicated back to the patient’s site dietitian (using IRB-approved communication 
channels) and will be entered into a REDCap database by [CONTACT_609276]’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_609237]. The site dietitian or site coordinating 
center dietitian (if local dietitian is unavailable) will follow up with the patient via telephone or in-
clinic to discuss any issues with the diet, discuss nutritional adequacy of diet, and recommend 
any adjustment in dietary intake or vitamin supplements. The dietitian will continue to attempt 
contact [CONTACT_609277].
Study Completion and N-of-1 Results Review: Following the final treatment period, participants 
will return to clinic within [ADDRESS_807873] physical exam including weight, height, 
medications, and clinical measure of disease activity. They will review the results of their trial via 
the Eureka N-of-1 platform with their clinician (Appendix G) and will complete a final questionnaire 
regarding their experience with the N-of-[ADDRESS_807874] physical exam with the participant.
The overall study procedure timeline is summarized in Figure 2.

Patients will be supported in their adherence to the diet through a variety of means.  
Dietitian/physician or advanced practice provider involvement and follow-up (as described above) 
is a key component to providing supportive coaching for patients and families.  In addition, 
resources, including print and web-based materials (Appendix B), will be made available for 
patients to support them in learning about the diet, provide ideas for meal planning, offer 
approaches for teaching other family members and friends about the SCD, handling family 
gatherings and special occasions, etc.16  
Outcome Measures 
Study outcomes and mediating factors are detailed in Table 1. Primary outcomes across all 
patients will include patient reported outcomes (PROs) of stool frequency, stool consistency, 
pain interference and GI symptom severity (see Appendix D), and fecal calprotectin. Secondary 
outcomes will include patient-reported disease activity scores as measured by [CONTACT_609278] (PUCAI)17,18 and Short Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (SCDAI)19, 
clinically-evaluated disease activity scores contained in ICN registry (PUCAI and  sPCDAI), 
growth, laboratory markers of inflammation and disease status [C Reactive Protein (CRP), 
Hematocrit, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), Albumin]. Fecal calprotectin was selected as 
the central marker of intestinal inflammation because it correlates well with both clinical and 
histologic remission, is noninvasive and objective, and has been shown to be a useful tool to 
monitor response to therapy20,21.  Safety Outcomes: The major safety concerns for patients with 
IBD participating in a diet intervention include weight loss and inadequate nutrition. Weight loss 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_609238].  Weight will be assessed at all 
clinic visits and at the dietitian follow up visits (weeks 4 and 12) and by [CONTACT_609279] a home scale available. If a home scale is available, patients will be 
instructed to obtain an initial weight on their home scale at the beginning of the baseline period 
and use the same home weighing scale throughout the study period. Nutrition intake will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_609280] 3-day diet 
diaries conducted at specified intervals (baseline and in weeks 3-5 of each treatment period) and 
weekly weight tracking (if available).  In addition, we will collect results of any serum Vitamin D 
level monitoring conducted as part of routine care and will report these results to the DSMB. 
Mediating factors: We will collect demographic data from the ICN registry including age, gender, 
USING SINGLE SUBJECT (N-OF-1) DESIGNS TO ANSWER PATIENT-IDENTIFIED RESEARCH 
QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page 22race, ethnicity, family education level, disease type, disease location, medications, and disease 
characteristics at baseline.  Dietitians will use data from 3-day diet diaries to assess deviation 
from the prescribed diet (Appendix F). We will also measure the patient and parent psychological 
well-being and expectations regarding benefit of diet as a treatment strategy as these may 
mediate adherence to the diets.
If a measure is missing in any of the sources listed below, we will obtain the data using other 
sources which could include secured email correspondence with the site and/or screening and 
eligibility verification case report forms.  The screening and eligibility verification case report form 
is a non-patient facing tool currently used by [CONTACT_609281].  
This form is uploaded to OneDrive so that the site coordinating center can confirm eligibility; thus, 
it is data the site coordinating center already routinely receives.

3.5 Participant Selection and Withdrawal
From ICN, we will recruit up to 60 patients with IBD and their families (primary caregivers) whose 
treatment decisions may be informed by [CONTACT_609283]. We will not exclude patients based on sex or race/ethnicity.  We intend to enroll evenly 
across ICN centers, but will allow for fewer or more participants per site based on numbers of 
eligible patients and success with recruitment.

3.5.3 Participant Pre-screening and Recruitment
We will recruit patients from participating ICN clinical sites. To introduce the study and provide 
information about dietary management for IBD/SCD, participating ICN clinics will mail a study flyer 
(Appendix J) to clinic patients prior to their upcoming appointment, call them by [CONTACT_648], and/or 
approach them at their clinic visit. Additionally, the study flyer will be available on various social 
media platforms. There will also be a study poster available for participating ICN clinics for use in 
advertising the study to potential participants (Appendix O). For those families who may be 
interested in a parent perspective of the SCD diet, a letter from our parent partners will be 
available (see Appendix P). Potential participants will also be informed about the study opportunity 
via several established channels within the ICN network, including monthly newsletters and blogs. 
In addition, we hope to make a short, animated video that will be used to recruit patients. The 
script for the video is attached as an Appendix B. As with our other patient-facing materials, since 
the study is pragmatic and minimal risk, we request to use this script as a template. It may have 
minor edits to the script which would not require IRB approval.  Eligible participants will be 
identified through the standardized ICN pre-visit planning process. The site principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_609240]. Study participants will enroll in the trial with their clinical team 
at a regularly scheduled clinic visit or at another visit within 2 weeks of a regularly scheduled visit 
if more convenient for the participant. Local clinic research coordinators will maintain a screening 
log in REDCap to track those that are screened, those who are excluded (and for what reasons), 
those that decline, and those who have enrolled. Most ICN clinic sites have obtained HIPAA 
waivers that allow study coordinators to identify potential study participants, evaluate patients for 
study eligibility at pre-visit planning meetings, and discuss participation in studies prior to consent 
being signed. For those who decide to participate, informed consent (and assent where 
applicable) will be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures.  
3.5.[ADDRESS_807876] ≥ 7.5% nonintentional weight loss.  Patients 
may also withdraw if they feel that they are unable or unwilling to continue the assigned diet or 
data collection. Participants will be dropped from the study if they have a symptom tracking 
response rate of <50% in the baseline period that does not improve after reasonable attempts by 
[CONTACT_28932] (as outlined in the study SOPs) to assist participants in improving data 
collection. Because completion of stool fecal calprotectin is required to advance from one 
treatment period to another, a participant who never collects and sends in a stool specimen will 
be dropped at that point in the study. All data from such participants will be retained and analyzed. 
Patients who wish to terminate a treatment period early (and switch to the next assigned 
treatment) will not be considered withdrawals. Participants who wish to end their study 
participation early, but have completed at least two full diet treatment periods (i.e., A1 and B1), 
will have the option to discontinue participation and terminate the protocol early.  Participants who 
choose to discontinue from the study in these instances will schedule a time to come into clinic to

Version: 5.2, January 29, [ADDRESS_807877], or if the treatments were different than the patient’s usual diet, it is not necessary to 
protect against a false-positive decision as in standard hypothesis tests used in clinical trials; thus 
sample size calculations are not recommended for individual N-of-1 trials26. For obtaining an 
estimate of the population average effects of the SCD vs. modified SCD on improving symptoms, 
a total of up to 60 patients will participate in the two- treatment crossover study.  Using the weekly 
PROMIS pain interference T-score measure (standardized mean of [ADDRESS_807878] deviation of 
10) and incorporating aspects of the design related to the number of planned crossovers, washout 
periods, and autocorrelation from repeated measures, we will have 90% power with a two-sided 
5% alpha to detect a mean difference of 3 points between groups which corresponds to the 
minimally important difference on the PROMIS measures, except in the case when  and 𝜎𝑡=5
 when the minimal detectable difference is above 3 to obtain 90% (but not 80% power).𝜌>0.5
3.6.2 Statistical Methods
An overview of the statistical analysis can be found below. A formal data and statistical analysis 
plan will be prepared as a separate document
Analysis of Individual N-of-1 Trials: For the first treatment period only, there will be a 1-week run-in 
period as the participant gradually transitions from their usual diet to the intervention diet.  A 
gradual transition is not needed beyond the first treatment period.  For the first period, we will 
discard the first [ADDRESS_807879] weekly measure during 
each treatment period. At the end of each person’s N-of-1 trial, statistical analysis will be 
performed to compare results on the two treatments. Each N-of-1 trial requires a separate 
analysis which is automated to run in the background once each trial is completed. The analysis 
consists of running Bayesian models that compare the average response on each of the two 
treatments and baseline diet. Models will incorporate the appropriate scales for the outcomes 
(e.g. normal distributions for continuous variables, multinomial distributions for categorical 
variables) and the appropriate representation of the function linking the expected outcome to the 
predictors (e.g., cumulative logit link for ordinal outcomes).  
Results will be reported for all study measures (stool frequency, stool consistency, PROMIS Pain 
interference, PROMIS GI Symptoms, fecal calprotectin) to enable patients to weigh symptoms 
that are most important to them. For each outcome, each patient will be provided with an estimate 
USING SINGLE SUBJECT (N-OF-1) DESIGNS TO ANSWER PATIENT-IDENTIFIED RESEARCH 
QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page 26of the (1) difference in efficacy between the two diets; and (2) probability that each treatment is 
better than the other; as well as the (3) difference in efficacy between each diet and the baseline 
level; and (4) probability that each treatment is better than the baseline. Results will be portrayed 
numerically and graphically. We will develop educational materials to aid patients and clinicians 
in interpretation (Appendix B). Posterior probabilities of outcomes will be calculated using an 
interface that incorporates open-source R software interfacing through Rjags with open-source 
JAGS software.27 The R code creates the Bayesian model, loads the stored data and chooses 
intelligent starting values that are then fed into JAGS to return the Markov chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) simulations of the joint posterior distribution. The R package will accept input from the 
Eureka platform to construct models and return results back to Eureka for display. 
Statistical analyses will be completed and patients will be given results of their individual N-of-[ADDRESS_807880] one paired treatment period and there is enough data in both 
treatment periods to perform valid statistical analysis.
Meta-Analysis of N-of-1 Trials: The collection of individual N-of-[ADDRESS_807881] 
in the population of patients studied, while the within-patient estimates describe an improved 
estimate of each patient’s true effect assuming exchangeability across patients. We will fit these 
models using a Bayesian multilevel model with non-informative priors in order to obtain posterior 
distributions of the within and between effect sizes. We will then compare the multilevel patient 
estimates with those from the patient’s data alone in order to determine how much the effects 
change and how much additional precision these estimates gain. We will also include between-
patient covariates to account for variability and to test for heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE). 
We hypothesize that HTE may exist based on age, sex, disease (CD or UC/IC), disease activity 
(mild or moderate), maintenance medication use, disease location, and disease type 
(inflammatory or penetrating). The model will include the baseline levels of the outcomes which 
will enable estimates of the effect of the study diets relative to the unrestricted diet. We will also 
fit models that adjust for trends over time and account for correlation and carryover. Analyses will 
use the appropriate probability distribution and link function for the outcome variable type (e.g. 
normal distributions for continuous outcomes and ordinal logistic regression with a cumulative 
logit link for scales).
Missing data: Based on our experience, the overall completion rates of daily symptom trackers 
and weekly surveys by [CONTACT_609285] >80%, we have found that when participants 
are working on a specific test or personal experiment with their physician, adherence increases 
to >90%. In cases of missing outcome data, we will ignore the missing values in the analysis of 
individual N-of-[ADDRESS_807882] them to be completely collected (e.g., there 
will not be a need for a statistical approach to address missing data for these variables). In the 
meta-analysis, we will perform the following sensitivity analyses for different types of missing data:

Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. Since the study procedures 
are not greater than minimal risk, significant AEs are not expected. Potential AE’s could include 
allergic reaction to a component of the diet, significant intolerance of the diet other than as an 
allergic reaction, and/or unintentional weight loss of ≥ 5%.
Expected adverse events include:
Mild to moderate increase in abdominal pain, diarrhea, gas/bloating within the first 3-4 
weeks of starting the new diet
Weight loss of less than 5% in the first 3-4 weeks of starting the new diet
Worsening of IBD due to failure of the diet to improve the disease. This could be 
manifested as new onset or worsened, bloody stools, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fistula, 
abscess, or bowel obstruction
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_609241]. However, if an SAE occurs and is determined to be 
possibly or definitely related to study treatment, it will be reported in accordance with CCHMC’s 
IRB SOPs (as described in Section 3.7.2).
3.7.2 Adverse Event Reporting
As the study is being conducted with the engagement of the participant’s clinical 
team/gastroenterologist, the medical team will seek information on AE’s as a part of regular 
contact [CONTACT_6635] (any patient or clinician initiated phone call or email, or at scheduled 
clinical visits). The Investigator is responsible for recording and reporting anticipated and 
unanticipated problems related to research that occur during and after study treatment. All AE’s 
will be reported to the data coordinating center at CCHMC, including relationship of the AE to the 
study procedures (definitely related, possibly related, unlikely related, or not related).  AE’s that 
are unexpected (not included in list of expected adverse events in Section 3.7.1) and are deemed 
by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_609242].  All SAEs 
(CCHMC or relying sites) deemed possibly or definitely related to the intervention will be reported 
to the IRB in accordance with CCHMC IRB policies. Since the study procedures are not greater 
than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any unanticipated problems related to the research, 
involving risks to participants or others, happen during this study (including SAEs), these will be 
reported to the IRB in accordance with CCHMC IRB SOPs 
3.7.3 Investigator reporting
Investigators are responsible for safety reporting to the central and/ or local IRBs. Investigators 
are responsible for complying with the central and/or local IRB’s reporting requirements, though 
must submit the required reports no later than 10 working days.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_68036]’s study file.

QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, [ADDRESS_807883] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed participant’s authorization informing the participant of the following: 
What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from participants in this study
Who will have access to that information and why
Who will use or disclose that information
The rights of a research participant to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
In the event that a participant revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of participant 
authorization.  For participants that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the participant is alive) 
at the end of their scheduled study period.
3.8.2 ICN Registry
In 2007, ICN established a standardized, web-based clinical registry that enabled collection of 
standardized, IBD-specific data about processes and outcomes of care (e.g., disease 
characteristics, patient well-being, laboratory results, and medications). In 2010, with AHRQ 
funding, ICN developed a modular, open-source, registry that can be linked to an electronic 
health record (EHR) to minimize the burden of manual data entry. This allows for a significant 
portion of registry data to be transferred electronically via a secure web portal to the registry, 
and stored for re-use in QI, chronic care delivery, and comparative effectiveness research.

conform to a standardized data model. As previously described, this study will use data on 
demographics, baseline characteristics, and changes to disease activity/inflammation and 
medications as collected from the ICN Registry.
3.8.[ADDRESS_807885].  Data on screening and enrollment (including patient name [CONTACT_609294]), 
nutritional assessments (including Vitamin D levels obtained as part of routine care), and AE 
reporting will be collected at the ICN site by [CONTACT_609286], dietitian, and/or central 
research coordinator at Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (for nutritional assessments only) and will be 
entered into the REDCap database.  
3.8.4 Source Documents
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the research.  Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples of these original documents and data records include: Eureka N-
of-1 app and database, the ImproveCareNow registry, clinical and office charts, memoranda, 
participants’ diaries (including 3-day food diary), output from the nutrition analysis program, 
recorded data from automated instruments, patient reported data recorded in the N-of-[ADDRESS_807886] patient reported outcomes data (as described in Table 1)

3.9 Data Security for Eureka Technology Platform
Data on patient symptoms and PRO’s will be collected via the Eureka platform. The Eureka 
mHealth Research Platform Resource is a mobilized cohort and infrastructure used to carry out 
clinical research studies using mobile and digital technology.  Patients will submit their data via 
SMS text messages, via mobile applications, via secure websites, or will upload their data from 
other services they may authorize.  Simple, non-PHI carrying messages are sent by [CONTACT_1190], 
and typi[INVESTIGATOR_609243].  The only PHI involved in the

QUESTIONS – AIM 1
Version: 5.2, January 29, 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page 30transaction is the phone number or unique ID used to identify the patient’s phone.  This data is 
then stored on the study platform as previously described.
Eureka will support a registration procedure that will allow registration with identifying information 
that will generally include name, date of birth, and mobile phone number or email address. Eureka 
also provides investigators with the option of requiring confirmation of mobile phone numbers and 
email addresses.   In registering for our study, the Eureka Privacy Policy and Data Security 
Measures will be presented to participants (Appendix N).
3.9.1 Eureka Risks:
The risk of loss of privacy in our study hosted by [CONTACT_609287]. Loss of privacy could occur by [CONTACT_609288], e.g. to prevent serious harm 
to the participant or others. This is the primary reason for the Eureka Privacy Policy and Data 
Security Measures (attached document).
3.9.2 Eureka Efforts to Minimize Risk:
To minimize risk of loss of privacy, Eureka takes the following steps:
Technical system security: Information will be transmitted and stored using state-of-the-art 
security systems similar to those that protect websites used by [CONTACT_609289].  Specifically, the Eureka Platform is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud-
based server system and computing services that are HIPAA compliant, and Eureka follows 
security guidelines of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA).  Specifically, all research data are stored behind a secure firewall, guarded by [CONTACT_609290], and encrypted at rest and in transit in our Amazon Virtual Private Cloud.
Inform patients: As described above, we will include the Eureka Privacy Policy and Data Security 
Measures that will be referenced in study onboarding and viewable at any time.  The statement 
will inform patients of the risks of loss of privacy, including via technical compromise or legal 
requirements.  We will also make them aware that they are responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_609244].
3.9.3 Confidentiality Measures:
Identifying information (name [CONTACT_102600]) will be stored in separate (but linked) data tables 
so that health-related data can be viewed by [CONTACT_609291].
In the event of a data break, the Eureka Research Platform Team will notify all Study Teams and 
Study Participants in accordance with UCSF guidelines.
3.9.4 Data Storage & Security:
Data is stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS or Amazon Cloud).  AWS is FEDRAMP compliant 
and has an Authorization to Operate from the Department of Health and Human Services.  The 
security controls in place meet or exceed HIPAA compliance. Data are coded; data key is kept

Background and Significance  
Individuals with tetraplegia and paraplegia above T5 struggle with persistent hypotension,4-11 epi[INVESTIGATOR_682885] (OH) 12-[ADDRESS_924930] 
reported a systolic BP (SBP) below [ADDRESS_924931] injury (SCI) compared to a normotensive SCI cohort.[ADDRESS_924932] autonomy, social 
independence and quality of life (QOL).36, 37  In the 1990’s the British Journal of Medicine published a series of 
papers on the association between low BP and mood disorders.24, 31, 32, [ADDRESS_924933] been repeatedly reported in the SCI 
population,68-70 and we found significantly increased Becks Depression Index score in hypotensive individuals 
with SCI compared to the normotensive SCI cohort.33  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_213151], chronic asymptomatic hypotension 
has not attracted clinical attention; in a retrospective chart review we found that nearly 40% of veterans with 
SCI had clinical BP values entered into the medical record indicative of hypotension;71 however less than 1% 
carried the diagnosed or were prescribed anti -hypotensive therapy.52   
 
Although as early as 1927 individuals with low BP were described as those who lacked stamina, tired 
easily, complained of cold extremities and showed a n inability to do prolonged mental or physical work; [ADDRESS_924934] challenged the notion that low BP is a health concern, suggesting that hypotension is the 
ideal “normal” BP and a benefit to longevity and cardiovascular health.3, 72  In addition, th ere is a general lack 
of consensus regarding the definition of hypotension, as well as whether chronic hypotension exists,73 or is a 
problem. 2, 74  In 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined hypotension as a SBP ≤ 110 mmHg for 
males and ≤ [ADDRESS_924935] to diastolic BP (DBP).  However, much of the literature on 
hypotension is equivocal regarding its definition.  Large epi[INVESTIGATOR_155960] l studies discuss hypotension as BP in 
the lowest 5 -30% of the population,25, 26, 28 while smaller studies report cut -offs to define systolic hypotension of 
between 100 and 120 mmHg.24, 27, 31, 32, 65  In addition, there is discussion about whether or not “constitutional 
hypotension” exists, 73 and while several Eastern European countries diagnose and treat individuals with  
hypotension, many English speaking countries are not convinced that low BP is a clinical syndrome, and 
actually believe that hypotension conveys significant cardiovascular benefit.3  Yet, compared to normotensive 
males, 13 -year mortality risk for all causes and cardiovascular disease was 2.4 to 3.4 times greater, 
respectively, in men ages 40 -49 with systolic hypotension; by [CONTACT_2163], systolic hypertension conveyed a 
1.7 fold increase in all cause mortality. 62   
 
We understand that the diagnosis and treatment of disease is usually based on causa l associations 
between symptoms and physiological pathology;2 and the “non -disease state” was described as the diagnosis 
of a particular disease when confirmatory ‘symptomology’ is not readily apparent, [ADDRESS_924936] to persons diagnosed with asymptomatic hypertension, 
and aggressive treatment if often recommended.   Moreover, OH was defined in 1996 by [CONTACT_682894] a fall in SBP of greater than or equal to 20/[ADDRESS_924937] demonstrated significantly poorer prognosis among younger individuals 
(early to mid 40s) who were OH positive compared to OH negative individuals.55, 58, [ADDRESS_924938] (midodrine hydrochloride) induced significant elevations in BP which were 
associated with increased resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and a more pronounced rise in CBF with the 
execution of a cued re action time task.[ADDRESS_924939] 
performance.35   
 
Midodrine hydrochloride [d,1-alpha -(2’5’-dimethoxyphenyl) -β-(glycinamidoethanol); C 12H19N2O4Cl] is a pro -
drug that undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis in the systemic circulation to form the active metabolite 
desglymidodrine; midodrine is nearly completely absorbed after oral administ ration,83 even in models of NOH 
in which gastroparesis is common .84  It has been shown that midodrine does not cross the blood brain barrier; 
therefore, it is not associated with central nervous system effects.[ADDRESS_924940] bee n conducted to determine the efficacy of midodrine to 
treat symptomatic OH in various models of autonomic failure (Bradbury -Eggleston [pure autonomic failure], 
Shy-Dragers syndromes [multiple system atrophy], Parkinson’s disease and diabetic neuropathy).46, 84, 86, [ADDRESS_924941] that midodrine improves subjective 
reporting of energy level and depression.46, 47  
 
Although our data indicate that between 39% and 70% of the SCI population is hypotensive, less than 1% 
of vet erans with SCI is diagnosed or prescribed treatment for this condition.52, 71  Disparity between the 
prevalence of hypotension and the diagnosis in the SCI population is disturbing because of the possible 
deleterious effects  on cognitive function, mood and QOL; adverse effects which may be magnified in 
individuals with a long -term physical disability.36, 37  Further, although these individuals do not complain of 
symptoms, a recent rep ort found significantly increased incidence of ischemic stroke in the Taiwan’s SCI 
population compared to age -, sex - and propensity -matched controls, which may relate  to persistent cerebral 
hypoperfusion, secondary to systemic hypotension .[ADDRESS_924942]. Jill Wecht has been funded since 2000 by [CONTACT_682895]&D Service to investigate the  consequences of 
decentralized cardiovascular autonomic control on BP in persons with SCI.  She has received four investigator -
initiated Merit Reviews (# B3203R,  #F6980R,  #B6999R  and #B7537R), two Career Development Awards (RCD 
#B3346V and CDA II #A6161W), and she is the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_682886] (CoE: B4162C ).  [CONTACT_105613]’s VA 
funded research has involved the study of the mechanisms of BP control as well as t esting the efficacy and 
safety of therapeutic treatment options for hypotension and OH in persons with SCI.  Although [CONTACT_105613] has 
been successful in securing funding for these investigator -initiated projects, her studies have been limited by 
[CONTACT_682896] s mall in sample sizes.  It must be appreciated that before long term treatment of chronic 
asymptomatic hypotension should be recommended in the SCI population, a large -scale randomized 
placebo -controlled clinical trial must be conducted.  It is our primary objective that the data generated 
by [CONTACT_682897] a large -scale study to 
determine the effects of sustained elevation in BP, to normotensive levels (SBP 111 -139 mmHg), on 
CBF, cognitive function, mo od and QOL in persons with SCI .  Until that time, the following text describes 
advances made on several research initiatives conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wecht and her associates to identify the 
prevalence and adverse consequences of hypotension in persons with SCI.    
 
Prevalence of hypotension in veterans with SCI  
 In 2008, [CONTACT_105613] and colleagues had a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_682887]&D Service 
(#B6999R ) entitled “Prevalence of Blood Pressure 
Abnormalities among Veterans with SCI”.  The 
investigatio n determined the rates of BP abnormalities 
diagnosed and treated in a veteran SCI population based 
on the medical record charting over a [ADDRESS_924943] been accepted for publi cation (Appendix 
3), suggest an increased prevalence of hypotension 
among veterans with SCI (28.79%) compared to a 
matched non -SCI veteran cohort (11.89%) (χ2=10.4; 
p<0.01).  Further delineation by [CONTACT_682898] 3rd 
decade of life in those with SCI, but an increased 
observation of hypotension does not become obvious until the 7th decade  of life in the matched non -SCI 
veteran cohort (Figure 1).   
 
Although the prevalence of hypotension was increased in veterans with tetraplegia (T [C3 -C8]: 35.07%) 
and high paraplegia (HP [T1 -T6]: 26.59%) compared to those with low paraplegia (LP [T7 and b elow]: 4.42%), 
the use of anti -hypotensive agents was comparable, and essentially negligible, among the 3 groups (0.1, 0.5 
and 0.3%, respectively).   Furthermore, prescription of anti -hyper tension agents was substantially increased 
compared to anti -hypo tensive agents and was comparable among individuals with T (54%), HP (55%) and LP 
(54%); although the diagnosis of hypertension was significantly reduced in those with T (39.1%) and HP 
(44.2%) compared to veterans with LP (59.6%; p<0.05).  Thus, the prevalenc e of hypotension is increased in 
veterans with SCI; the incongruously low prescription of anti -hypotensive agents may reflect general lack of 
clinical appreciation of the adverse affects of hypotension on QOL and/or a paucity of data supporting the safe 
and efficacious use of these agents in the SCI population.  
 
Hypotension and Cognitive Performance in Persons with SCI  
In 2008 the VA RR&D Service funded an Associate Investigator Award to Adejoke Jegede , PhD  ( # 
B4968R ) entitled “Relationship between Blood Pressure, Cerebral Blood Flow, and Learning in Persons with 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17751]”;  [CONTACT_105613] was her Primary Mentor.   The findings, which have been published in two 
reports, 33, [ADDRESS_924944] that hypotensive individ uals with SCI, regardless of level of lesion, years of education or 
premorbid IQ, perform significantly more poorly on neuropsychological tasks of memory and attention & 
processing speed compared to normotensive individuals with SCI; it should be noted tha t the self -reported

incidence of traumatic brain injury was comparable between the hypo - and normotensive cohorts. [ADDRESS_924945] an inappropriate reduction in CBF during cognitive te sting in individuals with 
SCI compared to a statistically significant increased in CBF during testing in the non -SCI controls.  Although 
we were unable to establish a relationship between BP, CBF and cognitive performance, subjects with SCI, 
regardless of lesion level, had significantly reduced SBP [A], CBF during testing [B] and poorer test 
performance on the Stroop color task [C] compared to the non -SCI controls (Figure 2).  In fact, 62% of the SCI 
group met criteria the WHO for hypotension (100±20 mmHg),  compared to 38% of the non -SCI controls 
(117±19 mmHg) and, 46% of the SCI cohort had cognitive t -scores 1.[ADDRESS_924946] deviations below the 
normative mean (mild cognitive impairment) compared to 19% of the controls.   These observations strongly 
support an increased prevalence of hypotension in the SCI population and suggest that relatively reduced CBF 
in concert with systemic hypotension may be associated with diminished cognitive performance.  
 
Effects of Midodrine on BP, CBF and Cognitive Performance in P ersons with SCI  
In 2006 The VA RR&D Service renewed [CONTACT_275383] A. Bauman’s CoE (#B4162C), and a component of 
the Cardiovascular Autonomic Program within the CoE was entitled “ Determination of the Efficacy of an α -
Agonist on BP and CBF in Patients with Te traplegia”.  The results of this initiative have been published in two 
manuscripts. 43, [ADDRESS_924947].Wecht’s CDA II award 
(#A6161W) was determined the effect of midodrine (10 mg) on 4 -hour seated BP, CBF and performance on a 
serial subtraction task in hypotensi ve individuals with SCI.  
Data collection is ongoing but testing is complete in 14 
individuals with lesions from C3 -T4.  There was a significant 
increase in seated BP from the baseline (BL: 90±12/58±11 
mmHg) to the [ADDRESS_924948] drug (midodrine) average 
(119±18/76±14 mmHg; p<0.0001) and a statistically significant 
increase in CBF (39±9 to 44±11 cm/sec, respectively; p<0.01).  
Further the relationship between the change in SBP and the 
change in MFV following administration of midodrine was 
statistically signif icant (Figure 3).  To address the impact of 
significant increases in SBP and CBF on cognitive 
performance subjects performed a serial subtraction task, to 
assess intellectual efficiency, before and after midodrine 
administration.  Following midodrine admin istration the 
number of attempts was increased from BL (50.7±29.6 vs. 
43.2±28.2, respectively; p<0.05), and the number of correct 
response was also significantly increased (44.6±30 vs. 
40.0±28.7, respectively; p<0.05) in subjects with SCI.  
Although these data suggest that improved cognitive 
performance may be associated with elevation in BP and CBF 
following midodrine administration, this work was performed in a relatively small number of subjects, and the 
multiple regression model between physiological in creases (i.e., change in BP and CBF) and cognitive 
improvements (i.e., # correct responses after drug) was not statistically significant (r2=0.264; p=0.19).

“Development of the Blood Pressure Symptom Subdomain for the SCI -QOL”.  This project will use qualitative 
research techniques and validated psychometric analysis (i.e., Item Response Theory) to develop a ban k of 
questions which will help identify the impact of BP dysregulation (BPD) on QOL, and will assist in efforts to 
determine the efficacy of treatments for BPD on Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in persons with SCI.  The 
results of the first phase of inve stigation, focus group testing, has been accepted for publication (Appendix 3); 
the findings suggest that individuals with SCI and SCI clinical experts, with at least 5 years experience, were 
readily able to identify areas of everyday life that may be adve rsely impacted by [CONTACT_682900] (Figure 4).  While there was relatively good coherence in symptoms reporting between the patients 
and clinicians, reporting of fatigue, in association with BPD, was greater in the patients (18%) than providers 
(3%).  The total BPD item bank (BPQOL), which contains [ADDRESS_924950] trial.  Once dose 
has been determined subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_682901] (Interactive Touch Tone Randomization System) to 
receive either midodrine or placebo for the 30 -day out -patien t drug treatment intervention.  Randomization will 
occur in a double -blinded manner, and individuals that use an abdominal binder regularly will be stratified 
equally as will those with a positive history of traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Our recruitment t arget is 20 subjects 
per randomization category.  We estimate approximately 10% attrition during the 30 -day out -patient treatment 
protocol; as such, complete data will be available in ~[ADDRESS_924951] about 6 -8 weeks.

*The incidence of AD is reported to be between 48 -90% during rehabilitation in individuals with tetraplegia and 
high paraplegi a (above T6), 89-[ADDRESS_924953], the diagnosis of AD was about 6% of veterans with tetraplegia and high paraplegia (T1 -T6), 
the diagnosis of AD was less than 1% in those with lower thoracic lesions (T7 and below).[ADDRESS_924954] for an accurate  report of this condition, we will administer an AD questionnaire (Appendix 4) to 
all participants, any potential subject with frequent (3+ epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/week) or severe (BP elevation ≥ 150/95 
mmHg and/or self -reported adverse symptomology) epi[INVESTIGATOR_682888].  To evaluate the impact 
of midodrine on BP elevations during AD, eligible subjects will be sent home with the same survey, modified to 
include: subject number, the date and the BP readings.  
 
Screening Visit – Individuals with SCI will be  approached by [CONTACT_682902]. Any subject taking a vasoconstrictor 
agent will be asked to stop these medications 2 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) pr ior to the screening 
visit.  The screening assessments will include: medical intake information (Appendix 5), medical history 
(Appendix 6), physical examination, American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_682889] (AIS) classification, clinical 
symptoms survey fo r OH and BP monitoring.  The BP monitoring will include brachial manual assessments for 
10 minutes in the seated and 10 minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_682890].  Individuals 
will be eligible to participate if the average seated or s upi[INVESTIGATOR_682891] >135/85 mmHg.  This visit will take about 2 hours.  
 
Dose Determination Visit – The dose determination visit will be scheduled to begin no less than [ADDRESS_924955] that midodrine 
10 mg normalized seated SBP during a 4 -hour laboratory observation in 55% of the patients with SCI tested.  
Therefore, it is anticipated that the 10 mg d ose of midodrine will be adequate to normalize seated BP in about 
half of our sample.  However, we appreciate that some subjects with SCI will not respond adequately to 10 mg 
dose (our preliminary data suggest that 28% may require a higher dose), and other s may have a hypertensive 
response (>139 mmHg: 17%, based on preliminary evidence).  Eligible participants will be administered 
midodrine 10 mg, open -label, and BP will be monitored for 4 -hours; individuals with an average 4 -hour seated 
SBP between 111 -135 mmHg will be randomized to receive 10 mg midodrine (or placebo) during the 
Treatment Phase.  However in those with inadequate responses to 10 mg, a second open -label trial will be 
carried out to determine 4 -hour seated SBP responses at a higher dose (15 m g) for individuals with an average 
SBP ≤ 110 mmHg, and at a lower dose (5 mg) for those with an average SBP > 135 mmHg.  Individuals that 
respond to midodrine, at any of the doses tested, with two or more consecutive BP observations of >135/[ADDRESS_924956] -Treatment Visits – Within [ADDRESS_924957], eligible participants will return to the laboratory for pre -randomization testing including: (1) 
laboratory BP and heart rate (HR) assessments, (2) CBF measurement at rest and during cognitive testing, (3) 
cognitive testing, (4) mood and QOL s urveys, (5) 24 -hour ambulatory BP monitoring and (6) [ADDRESS_924958], and having avoided alcohol, 
caffeine, and nicotine for 12 -hours.  Subjects will remain in their wheelcha ir for instrumentation, which will 
include: 1) electrocardiogram (ECG): three surface electrodes will be applied to the chest for continuous 3 -lead 
recording of heart rate (HR); 2) brachial BP: will be monitored using a manual sphygnomometer and finger 
arteriolar beat -to-beat BP will be recorded using a photoplethysmograph placed around the middle and index 
fingers of the left hand; 3) CBF: will be monitored and recorded from the right and left middle cerebral artery 
(MCA) using transcranial Doppler ultraso und technology.  Subjects will remain in the seated position for 30 
minutes of baseline (BL) data collection; HR, BP, CBF will be monitored continuously for 5 -minutes at 0, 10 
and 20 minutes, brachial BP will be monitored and recorded at 30 -second interval s during each of the 5 -minute 
data collections periods.  After the BL assessments subjects will be asked to participate in a complete 
neuropsychological battery (Appendix 7) which will include assessments of: pre-morbid intellectual abilities, 
attention & concentration, information processing, memory, and executive control .  The NP battery will take 
about 60 minutes to complete and HR, BP, and CBF will be monitored and recorded during this testing.  After 
the NP battery is complete, subjects will be asked t o answer questions related to how BPD impacts their mood 
and QOL (Appendix 8); these short form questionnaires were developed for use in the SCI population and will 
take about [ADDRESS_924959] of hypotension on QOL by [CONTACT_682903] (Figure 4), we will assess fatigue specifically using the PROMIS short form and the 
fatigue severity scale ( Appendix 8). Finally, subjects will be equipped with a [ADDRESS_924960] their activities of daily living (ADL) in association with the BP recordings 
(Appendix 9).  In addition, subjects will be sent home with a  24-hour urine collection contained and will be 
asked to empty their leg bag, or to urinate into this contained at each voiding for a [ADDRESS_924961] -randomization testing will be scheduled for approximately 30±3 days after  
randomization and, prior to returning to the laboratory, subjects will be asked to take their morning dose of the 
study medication.  These visits will take about 4 hours.  
 
Treatment Phase –After pre -randomization testing, subjects will be randomized to ei ther midodrine (at the 
individually effective dose) or matching placebo and will be sent home with a one -month (30±3 day) supply. 
Subjects will be asked to take the study medication three times per day, at approximately 8 am, 12 noon and 4 
pm; however, eac h patient will establish his/her daily regimen with [CONTACT_682913] based on their individual 
sleep/wake schedules and ADLs. Subjects will be asked to keep a log of the time of day each dose was taken 
along with their BP and any adverse events (Appendix 10).  Th ree BP values will be recorded and uploaded 
directly to www.HealthVault.com  at the time of dosing and 1 hour after taking each daily dose  (total of 18 BP 
entries daily) .  Only study investigators will have access to; this website, which will be password protected and 
the data will be stored behind the VA firewall. Study investigators will review daily BP entries and will contact 
[CONTACT_682904] a hypertensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  Sub jects will be asked to 
report, immediately (withi n 1 hour), any significant AE , and study investigators will contact [CONTACT_682905] .  If an individual develops a fever or any 
other  symptom of an acute illness or infection they will be taken off study medication and discontinued from 
participation  and will be encouraged to visit their primary care physician for an evaluation .  If after treatment of 
the illness or infection the subjec t is cleared for participation by [CONTACT_682906]/she may resume 
participation beginning with pre -randomization testing.  
 
Interim Visit : Subjects will be asked to return to the laboratory approximately 10 days after randomization, in 
the late mo rning or early afternoon, after taking their scheduled daily dose for assessment of BP, HR and CBF 
and AE reporting.  This visit will take about 2 hours.  
 
Follow -up Visit – A follow -up visit will be scheduled [ADDRESS_924962] information on any AE(s) experienced after discontinuation of study medication and for a final laboratory 
assessment of HR, BP and CBF.  This visit will take about 2 hours.  
 
Data and Statistical Analysis  – The objectives of this proposed in vestigation are to determine the effects of 
normalizing BP for 30 -days on with midodrine hydrochloride compared to matching placebo, in hypotensive 
individuals with SCI, on: 1) CBF at rest and during cognitive testing, 2) cognitive function, 3) mood and QO L, 
and (4) the number and severity of AE reporting.  A similar proposal was submitted to the VA Cooperative 
Studies Program, but was not funded due to the lack of convincing preliminary data demonstrating that 
increases in systemic BP, secondary to extende d use of midodrine in hypotensive individuals with SCI, raises 
CBF at rest and during cognitive testing and improves test performance (Appendix 11).  Therefore, this 
project will test the following hypotheses in an effort to provide sufficient and convinci ng data to 
support a large -scale clinical trial to determine the long term benefits of normalizing BP in individuals 
with SCI across multiple VA sites through the VA Cooperative Studies Program.  
 
Study  Objective s:  
Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_682892] 30 -days of treatment with midodrine compared to those treated with placebo. We plan to 
classify individuals as normotensive if SBP is within the target range of 111 -139 mmHg f or ≥ 50% of the 24 -
hour observation (i.e., about 60 BP recordings)  during the post -treatment period and t he post -treatment relative 
risk of hypotension in the midodrine group versus placebo group will be assessed. Relative risk will be 
determined by [CONTACT_682907] g raw data into simple counts in a 2x2 contingency table, from which the proportion of 
cases that are classified as hypotensive in the midodrine group will be divided by [CONTACT_682908]. The 95% confidence interval for the relative risk value will be constructed, as 
described by [CONTACT_682909].92  In addition, clinical relevance will be quantified by [CONTACT_682910] (NNT) from the relative risk cal culation as follows: NNT = 1 / (hypotension rate in 
midodrine group – hypotension rate in placebo group).  
 
We hypothesize that, during  a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 24 -hour day, the proportion of SBP observations within the target range 
of 111 -139 mmHg will be increased afte r treatment with midodrine compared to placebo, after controlling for 
the baseline proportion.  We anticipate that about >50% of the subjects randomized to midodrine will have 
normal [ADDRESS_924963] < 25% of in dividuals randomized to 
receive placebo to have normal 24 -hour SBP after the 30 -day intervention.   If our postulated values are 
accurate, the relative risk for hypotension for the subjects on midodrine would be ~0.67, which represents 
about a 33% reduction  in the rate of hypotension in subjects treated  with midodrine compared to those 
randomized to placebo.   The resulting NNT is ~ 4, which suggests that about  [ADDRESS_924964] of increasing SBP to normal levels on the following outcome parameters:  
Cerebral Blood Flow:  
 Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to determine the change in CBF  at rest and during 
cognitive testing following random ization to midodrine versus placebo.  Pre -randomization CBF will be 
used as the covariate. Our hypothesis is that there will be a significant increase in CBF, both at rest 
and during cognitive testing, after 30 -days treatment with midodrine compared to pla cebo.     
Memory and Attention Processing : 
 ANCOVA will be used to determine the change in cognitive function  from baseline to post -treatment 
following randomization to midodrine versus placebo, using the pre -randomization t -score as the 
covariate. Our hypo thesis is that there will be a significant improvement in cognitive function in 
individuals treated with midodrine as assessed by [CONTACT_682911] 
& processing speed compared to those randomized to placebo.  
Depression, Anxiety and Fatigue : 
 ANCOVA will be used to determine the change in mood and QOL score  from baseline to post -
treatment following randomization to midodrine versus placebo, using the pre -randomization QOL score 
as the covariate.  Our hypothesis  is that ther e will be a significant improvement in QOL in individuals 
treated with midodrine as assessed by [CONTACT_682912].  
Adverse Events Reporting : 
 To determine the differences in AEs reported  at the end of 30 -days treatment follo wing randomization 
to midodrine versus placebo.  Our hypothesis  is that there will be an increase in mild and moderate 
drug-related AEs in individuals treated with midodrine compared to those on placebo.  A few AE's may 
be expected to include supi[INVESTIGATOR_682893] (may not have been present prior to drug 
administration), exacerbation of AD (elevated BPs recorded during known trigger’s for AD, such 
as bowel care, bladder distension, transfers), pruritis, urinary retention  and more severe or more 
frequent heada ches.   
Secondary Analyses : 
 Our conceptual model is that prescription medication class, use of support stockings, abdominal 
binders and history of TBI may function as mediator variables between SCI and the dependent 
variables. To explore this mediation, at a first level of analysis we will examine the bivariate 
relationships between the mediator and dependent variables. Second, we will build hierarchical multiple 
regression models in which a potential mediator variable and SCI status (dummy coded) are both 
forced into the model. In addition, examination of the partial correlation between SCI and dependent 
variables (after partialing out the effect of the mediators relative to the zero order correlation will provide 
insight into the effect size.

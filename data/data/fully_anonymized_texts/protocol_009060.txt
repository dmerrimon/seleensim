SAFETY VARIABLES: 
The safety and tolerability profiles of obicetrapib alone, ezet imibe alone, and obicetrapib in 
combination with ezetimibe will be assessed by [CONTACT_248116] o f 
AEs. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: All study-collected data will be summarized  by [CONTACT_2070], 
graphs, and/or raw data listings . Descriptive statistics for co ntinuous variables will include number 
of participants (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, min imum, and maximum values. 
Analysis of categorical variabl es will include  frequency and pe rcentage. 
Analysis Populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Popula tion will include all participa nts randomized into the study. 
Treatment classification will be  based on the randomized treatment.  
The Modified ITT (mITT) Population will include all participant s in the ITT Population who 
receive at least [ADDRESS_301601] a baseline v alue for the LDL-C assessment. Any 
efficacy measurement obtained af ter a participant receives a re stricted lipid-altering therapy, 
outside of the current study design, will be removed from the m ITT analysis. Treatment 
classification will be based on the randomized treatment. The m ITT Population will be used for 
the primary analysis of  all efficacy endpoints. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all participants in the mITT Population who have 
a baseline value for the LDL-C assessment, have a Day [ADDRESS_301602] sufficient blood 
samples collected for valid e stimation of PK  parameters. 
NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-303 
Confidential & Proprietary Page [ADDRESS_301603] 1 dose of any study drug. 
Treatment classification will be based on the actual treatment received. The Safety  Population will 
be the primary population used f or the safety analyses. 
Analysis of Efficacy 
The mITT Population will be the primary population for the effi cacy analyses. Efficacy will also 
be analyzed using the ITT Popul ation and the PP Population as supportive analyses.  
The primary efficacy analysis of the percent change from Day 1 to Day 57 in LDL-C will be 
performed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) appr oach. The analysis will 
include fixed effects for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-vi sit interaction, al ong with a covariate 
of the baseline value. The Res tricted Maximum Likelihood estima tion approach will be used with 
an unstructured covariance matrix . The least squares means, sta ndard errors, and 2-sided 
95% confidence intervals for each  treatment group, for the pair wise comparisons of the 
combination therapy, obicetrapib monotherapy, and ezetimibe mon otherapy to placebo, and for 
the pairwise comparisons of combination therapy and obicetrapib  monotherapy versus ezetimibe 
monotherapy will be provided. The treatment comparison will be performed using a 2-sided test 
at the  = 0.05 level of significance. 
Missing data will be imputed usi ng multiple imputation methodol ogy. Results will be combined 
using Rubin’s method. Full details of the m odel and im putation will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
A similar MMRM model will be used for the analysis of the secon dary and exploratory efficacy 
endpoints corresponding to the percent change from baseline. Fo r the binary efficacy endpoints, a 
logistic regression analysis will be performed with model covariates of treatment group and 
baseline LDL-C.  
In order to maintain the overall  Type I error rate, the seconda ry efficacy endpoints will be tested 
sequentially at the 0.05 significance level according to the pre-specified order of hierarchy. No 
adjustment will be made for multiplicity in testing the explora tory efficacy endpoints. Nominal 
p-values will be provided when a pplicable. Descriptive and grap hical summaries by [CONTACT_248117]. A ny additional sensitivity and/or  supplemental analyses will be 
defined in the SAP. 
Analysis of Safety 
The Safety Population will be the primary population for the sa fety analyses. All safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively. No statistical inference will  be applied to the safety endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plasma obicetrapib concentrations will be summarized with descriptive statistics based on the PK 
Population. Exploration of any re lationships with obicetrapib exposure will be performed, as 
appropriate. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: 
A sample size of at least 100 eval uable participants (ie, 25 pa rticipants per treatment group) will 
provide >90% power to detect a 30% difference in LDL-C reduction at Day 57 (SD 15%) for the 
combination therapy group compar ed to the placebo group at a 2- sided significance level of 0.05.

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 The sample size for this study was determined in order to provide sufficient power (>80%) for the analyses of the primary effic acy endpoint and secondary efficac y endpoints described above. The 
sample size calculations used va lues reported from a previous c linical trial involving obicetrapib 
(TA-8995) as a starting point for  the assumptions of the treatm ent difference and standard 
deviation.
1 This sample size will also contribute sufficient participant e xposure and safety data. 
Participants will be stratified according to their Screening Vi sit (Visit 1) LDL-C value 
(<3.5 mmol/L [<135 mg/dL] or 3.5 mmol/L [ 135 mg/dL]).

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_76572], cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death 
globally, resulting in over 17 million deaths per year.1 Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major modifiable risk factor for the d evelopment of CVD.2,[ADDRESS_301609] ion.4 Approximately 100 million 
people worldwide are treated with  lipid lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], pre dominantly statins, to reduce 
LDL-C and the associated ris k of cardiovascular events. 
Statins are generally well tolerated, but their u se is limited in a substantial number of patients due 
to various adverse effects, inc luding statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and new-onset 
diabetes mellitus (NODM). SAMS c omprise myopathy, myalgia, and the most severe 
manifestation, rhabdomyolysis, which can result in serious comp lications including renal failure. 
However, in most cases, patients experience mild to moderate mu scle pain and weakness. The risk 
of NODM increases with intensive statin therapy, particularly i n patients with prediabetes.5 These 
manifestations, and other adverse events (AEs), may lead to discontinuation of statin therapy. This is commonly referred to  as statin intolerance
5 and may occur in 10% to 15% of patients,6 depriving 
patients of the cardioprotective benefits of statins. In additi on, discontinuation of statin therapy 
can increase the risk of acute cardiovascular events.7 Indeed, it is estimated that 9% of all 
cardiovascular events across th e European Union (EU) are the co nsequence of statin intolerance. 
An alternative to statins is the use of proprotein convertase s ubtilisin/kexin [ADDRESS_301610], and with a more fav orable safety profile to encourage 
long-term use and patient compliance. 
1.1 Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Inhibition 
Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a plasma glycoprot ein produced in the liver and 
adipose tissue. It circulates in the blood bound primarily to h igh-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol (HDL-C) and is invol ved in the transfer of choleste ryl esters and triglycerides (TG) 
between lipoproteins. In particula r, it mediates the transfer o f cholesteryl esters from HDL to the 
apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containi ng particles, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL-C, 
in exchange for TG. As a result, cholesteryl ester from HDL can  be taken up by [CONTACT_248118] B type 1; this action also leads to de creased HDL-C levels and ultimately 
to increased LDL-C levels. 
Inhibition of CETP activity reduces LDL-C levels and increases HDL-C levels. These effects are 
not only caused by [CONTACT_248119]-mediated cholesterol tran sfer from HDL to LDL, but also 
by a decrease in the number of ApoB-containing lipoproteins and  an increase in apolipoprotein A1 
(ApoA1)-containing lipoproteins. The LDL-C lowering effect, which arises from CETP inhibition 
and occurs through upregulation of the LDL-receptor, will benef it patients with elevated LDL-C 
and increased cardiovascular risk. Ference and colleagues have recen tly investigated the associati on between changes in LDL-C 
levels (and other lipoproteins) a nd the risk of cardiovascular events related to variants in the CETP

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 gene alone and in combination wi th variants in the 3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A 
reductase (HMGCR) gene.[ADDRESS_301611] this hypothesis directly.8 This has indeed been 
confirmed in a recent review where it was concluded that CETP i nhibitors could represent a useful 
addition to drugs currently bei ng used to treat high-risk patie nts intolerant to or not adequately 
treated with statins.10 Recently, the Clinical Trial Service Unit, University of Oxfor d, also 
presented that the absolute re duction in major adverse cardiova scular events 2 years after the 
REVEAL study was completed was nearly double (approximately 18% ) compared to that seen at 
the end of the 4-year treatment period with the CETP inhibitor anacetrapib (approximately 9%). 
In addition, between-group differenc es in the risk of coronary death emerged in the later years of 
follow-up; and, importantly, no safety concerns were described for non-vascular mortality or 
morbidity.11 In conclusion, CETP inhibition as monotherapy robustly lowers LDL-C and reduces 
CVD risk in those patients who are intolerant to statins, and the REVEAL study has shown no long-term on-targ et safety issues. 
1.2 Obicetrapib (TA-8995) 
Obicetrapib (TA-8995) has been shown to be a selective CETP inh ibitor. In addition to shuttling 
cholesterol esters from LDL-C to HDL-C particles, obicetrapib h as several additional 
compound-specific activities tha t are hypothesized to be beneficial in patients. Obicetrapib 
treatment has recently been shown to reduce the number of ApoB- containing particles that 
constitute LDL-C. Obicetrapib increases apolipoprotein E, which  leads to removal of cholesterol 
via the liver and also reduces lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)). Finally , obicetrapib not only potently 
increases HDL-C and the number of ApoA1-containing lipoproteins , but has been demonstrated 
to be a potent inducer of choles terol efflux, which is the main  driver of reverse cholesterol 
transport.
[ADDRESS_301612] is considered important because it is expected to reduce established 
atheroma burden. 
1.3 Clinical Development of Obicetrapib 
Both single ascending dose (TA-8995-01) and multiple ascending dose (TA-8995-02) studies have 
been conducted in healthy voluntee rs. A formal thorough QT/QTc study (TA-8995-04) has been 
completed and obicetra pib was shown to hav e no effect on correc ted QT interval by [CONTACT_6550]. A 
drug-drug interaction study (TA-8995-05) has also been conducte d; this study showed no 
significant effect of obicetrapib  on P-glycoprot ein activity, b ut this study showed  that obicetrapib 
is a mild inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4. A mass balance study in healthy males concluded that 
obicetrapib is steadily absorbed,  and the principal route of ex cretion was in the feces 
(TA-8995-07). Finally, bioequiva lence between obicetrapib capsu le and tablet fo rmulations was 
investigated (TA-8995-08) and established. 
NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-303 
Confidential & Proprietary Page [ADDRESS_301613] patient study conducted was a Phase 2 clinical study (TA-8995-03) in Denmark and the Netherlands where the aim was to evaluate the optimal dose of o bicetrapib alone and in 
combination with statins in participants with mild dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] . This study concluded that a daily 
dose of 5 mg obicetrapib resulted i n an LDL-C reduction of 45.3 %, an ApoB reduction of 33.6%, 
an HDL-C increase of 157.1%, an  ApoA1 increase of 57.5%, and a significant increase in HDL-C 
efflux capacity.
13 A second patient study (TA-8995-06) was conducted where the ef fect of 
obicetrapib on Lp(a) was investig ated following 12 weeks of tre atment. There was a statistically 
significant reduction in Lp(a) levels following 12 weeks of tre atment; however, the magnitude of 
the changes (approximately a 10% reduction) was not likely to b e clinically relevant. 
1.4 Rationale for Obicetrapib and Ezetimibe Combination Therapy 
An important therapeutic goal is to maximize LDL-C reduction fo r patients who cannot tolerate 
statin therapy. Ezetimibe selectively inhibits intestinal chole sterol absorption. Ezetimibe used as 
monotherapy for patients with hypercholesterolemia significantl y reduces serum LDL-C levels, 
as evidenced by a meta-analysi s of 8 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, with 
a statistically significant mean reduction in LDL-C of 18.58% compared with placebo.14 
Ezetimibe in combination with statin therapy further reduces LDL-C levels. A meta-analysis of 
27 studies, including more than 21,000 patients, demonstrated a 15.1% greater reduction in LDL-C 
in patients treated with statin and ezetimibe in combination co mpared with statin alone.[ADDRESS_301614] but statis tically significant further red uction in future cardiovascular events 
(a 2% absolute risk reduction ove r 7 years) in the combination group compared with statins alone. 
These large long-term studies have also demonstrated an excelle nt safety profile for ezetimibe. 
Importantly, additional Mendelian randomization studies have re vealed that the CETP inhibitor 
HMGCR inhibitor inte raction does not occur when a CETP inhibito r is combined with ezetimibe. 
Accordingly, to evaluate the pot ential for ezetimibe to further  augment LDL-C as well as ApoB 
reduction achieved by a CETP inhibitor, this study will test th e effect of obicetrapib and ezetimibe 
combination therapy compared to obicetrapib monotherapy and eze timibe monotherapy in 
participants with m ild dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. 
1.5 Risk/Benefit 
Obicetrapib has undergone extens ive nonclinical testing in the standard battery of tests according 
to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, in cluding repeat-d ose toxicity 
studies of up to [ADDRESS_301615] been expose d to obicetrapib in these studies. 
In Phase 1, a total of 159 subjects received single oral doses between 5 and 150 mg of obicetrapib, 
and 76 subjects received consecutive doses between 1 and 25 mg of obicetrapib for periods up to 
28 days. In Phase 2, a total  of 268 patients received 1 to 10 m g of obicetrapib for up to 12 weeks. 
Obicetrapib has been shown to be a selective CETP inhibitor. In  addition to shuttling cholesterol 
esters from LDL-C to HDL-C particles, obicetrapib has several a dditional compound-specific 
activities that are hypothesized t o be beneficial in patients. A dose of 5 mg obicetrapib resulted in 
an LDL-C reduction of 45.3%, an ApoB reduction of 33.6%, an HDL -C increase of 157.1%, an

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 ApoA1 increase of 57.5%, and a si gnificant increase in HDL-C ef flux capacity.[ADDRESS_301616] is 
considered important because it is expected to reduce establish ed atheroma burden. 
Single doses of obicetrapib up to 150 mg and multiple doses up to 25 mg administered over 28 days were generally well tolerated and safe in these studies. No cli nically significant effects on vital 
sign measurements (systolic and d iastolic blood pressure, heart  rate, and body temperature), 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) f indings, or results of safety laboratory tests or physical 
examinations were observed with obicetrapib treatment. In particular, no clinically significant changes in aldosterone, sodium , potassium, or bicarbonate concentrations were observed.  
In addition, no dose-related effe cts have been observed on the type, frequency, or intensity of 
treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) in clinical studies of obicetrap ib to date. In patient studies, most 
TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Of the patients with s evere TEAEs, 2 were suspected 
to be related to both obicetrapi b and statin treatment. The num ber of patients experiencing TEAEs 
and their severity were similar  across all treatment groups. Incidence rates of d rug-related TEAEs 
were also comparable for all tr eatment groups; the number of TE AEs in the obicetrapib treatment 
groups did not display a dose-dependent effect. There were 7 ra ndomized patients with a 
treatment-emergent serious AE (SAE), none of which were suspect ed to be study drug related. 
One patient had treatment-emerge nt SAEs that resulted in study discontinuation. No deaths 
occurred during these studies.

this treatment. An AE can therefo re be any unfavorable and/or u nintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally as s o c i a t e d  w i t h  t h e  u s e  o f  a n  
investigational medici nal product, whether  or not related to th e investigational medicinal product. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints , or symptoms, are to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs, which include clinical labor atory test variables, will be monitored and docum ented from the 
time of first dose of study drug until Visit 6. Participants sh ould be instructed to report any AE 
that they experience to the Investigator, whether or not they t hink the event is due to study drug. 
Beginning at the date of the first dose of study drug, Investig ators should make an assessment for 
AEs at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE eC RF. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associ ated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by  [CONTACT_76768]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a compon ent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be record ed as an AE, not the procedure itself.  
Any medical condition already pres ent at the date of the first dose of study drug should be recorded 
as medical history and not be reported as an AE unless the medi cal condition or signs or symptoms 
present at baseline change in severity, frequency, or seriousne ss at any time during the study. In 
this case, it should be  reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination  findings that are detected during 
the study or are present at the date of the first dose of study  drug and significantly worsen during 
the study should be reported as A Es, as described below. The Investigator will exe rcise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal  laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is  clinically significan t. Clinically signi ficant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repe at tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically signifi cant. Abnormal test results tha t are determined to be an error should 
not be reported as an AE. Laborat ory abnormalities or other abn ormal clinical findings should be 
reported as an AE if any of the  following are applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality; 
 If action taken with the study dr ug is required as a result of the abnormality; or 
 Based on the clinical judgmen t of the Investigator. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All 
noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product rel ated to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug react ion. “Responses” to a medicinal  product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal  product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the 
relationship ca nnot be ruled out.

Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-303 
Confidential & Proprietary Page [ADDRESS_301636] information . For obicetrapib, the reference 
safety information is included in  the Investigator’s Brochure currently in force. The reference 
safety information will be revi ewed yearly and the periodicity of the review will be harmonized 
with the reporting period of the D evelopment Safety Update Repo rt. 
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Ev ents by [CONTACT_248128] (intensity) of each A E as mild, moderate, or severe, and 
will also categorize each AE as to its potential relationship t o study drug using the categories of 
yes or no. 
Assessment of Severity 
Mild – An event that is easily t olerated and generally not interfering with normal  daily activities. 
Moderate – An event that is su fficiently discomforting to inter fere with normal daily activities. 
Severe – An event that is incap acitating with inability to work  or perform normal daily activities. 
Causality Assessment 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study dr ug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: No (unrelated, not related, or un likely to be related) – The ti me course between the administration 
of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules o ut a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) is suspected. 
Yes (possibly, probably, or defin itely related) – The time cour se between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consist ent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) can be identified. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal rel ationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there  are facts (evidence) or argum ents to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration- 
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The lengt h of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clin ical context o f the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
Each report should be evaluated i n the context of the natural h istory and course of the disease 
being treated and any other diseas e the participant may have. 
 Concomitant drug- The other drugs the participant is taking or the treatment the participant receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized t o cause the event in question.

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021  Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particu lar response is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses- 
The exposure to stress might induc e adverse changes in the reci pi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and 
better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug- 
The known pharmacologic propertie s (absorption, distribution, m etabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view  of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening ” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it  occurred in a mo re severe for m, might have caused death. 
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_248106]; 
Note: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186220] 1 overnight stay wil l be considered an inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An emergency roo m or urgent care visit without  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183049], nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206579] a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent, or elective trea tment of a pre-existing condition 
that did not worsen from baselin e. However, unexpected complica tions and/or prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_248107]. Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_248108] l reasons (ie, no place to stay, live 
too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) will  not be considered inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantia l disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important m edical event. 
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the abov e criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropria te medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant 
and may require medica l or surgical interv ention to prevent one  of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical event s include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependen cy.

Sponsor/designee. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is completed,  personnel will be notified 
electronically by [CONTACT_248129]. If  the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to  
 or call the  reporting line (telephone 
number listed below), and fax/ema il the completed paper SAE for m to  (contact 
[CONTACT_248130] 8.6 ) within [ADDRESS_301638] continue t o follow the participant until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of  persistent impairment), or the 
participant dies. Within [ADDRESS_301639] update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system  for the study and submit any s upporting documentation 
(eg, participant discha rge summary or autopsy reports) to  via fax or 
email. If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to  the procedures outlined above for 
initial reporting of SAEs. 
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
If a participant becomes pregnant  during the study or within th e safety follow-up period defined 
in the protocol, the Investigator is to stop dosing with study drug(s) immediately and the participant 
should be withdrawn from the study. Early termination procedure s should be implemented at that 
time.  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, it m ust be reported to  
 within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  will then 
provide the Investigator/site th e Exposure In Utero (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/site must complete t he EIU form and fax/email it b ack to .  
If the female partner of a male participant becomes pregnant wh ile the participant is receiving 
study drug or within the safety fo llow-up period defined in the protocol, the Investigator should 
notify  as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregn ancy, whenever possible. Once 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be completed and faxed/emailed to 
. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontane ous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), th e Investigator should follow t he procedures for reporting an SAE.

The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Populat ion will include all participants randomized into the study. 
Treatment classification will be  based on the randomized treatment.  
The Modified ITT (mITT) Populati on will include all participant s in the ITT Population who 
receive at least [ADDRESS_301643] a baseline v alue for the LDL-C assessment. Any 
efficacy measurement obtained after a participant receives a restricted lipid-altering therapy, outside of the current study design, will be removed from the m ITT analysis. Treatment 
classification will be based on the randomized treatment. The m ITT Population will be used for 
the primary analysis of  all efficacy endpoints. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all participants in the mITT Population who have a 
baseline value for the LDL-C assessment, have a Day [ADDRESS_301644] 1 dose of any study drug. 
Treatment classification will be based on the actual treatment received. The Safety Population will 
be the primary population used f or the safety analyses.

All study-collected data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070], graphs, 
and/or raw data listings. Descri ptive statistics for continuous  variables will include number of 
participants (n), mean, standard  deviation (SD), median, minimu m, and maximum values. Analysis 
of categorical variables will include frequency and percentage.  
9.2.1 Analysis of Efficacy 
The mITT Population will be the primary population for the effi cacy analyses. Efficacy will also 
be analyzed using the ITT Popul ation and the PP Population as supportive analyses. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis of  the percent change from Day 1 to Day 57 in LDL-C will be 
performed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The analysis will 
include fixed effects for treatme nt, visit, and treatment-by-vi sit interaction, al ong with a covariate 
of the baseline value. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood estima tion approach will be used with 
an unstructured covariance matrix. The least squares means, sta ndard errors, and 2-sided 
95% confidence intervals for each treatment group, for the pair wise comparisons of the 
combination therapy, obicetrapib monotherapy, and ezetimibe mon otherapy to placebo, and for 
the pairwise comparisons of comb ination therapy and obicetrapib  monotherapy versus ezetimibe

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary and exploratory efficacy analysis 
A similar MMRM model will be used for the analysis of the secon dary and exploratory efficacy 
endpoints corresponding to the perc ent change from baseline. Fo r the binary effic acy endpoints, a 
logistic regression analysis will be performed with model covar iates of treatment group and 
baseline LDL-C.  In order to maintain the overall  Type I error rate, the seconda ry efficacy endpoints will be tested 
sequentially at the 0.05 significance level according to the pre-specified order of hierarchy. No 
adjustment will be made for mul tiplicity in testing the explora tory efficacy endpoints. Nominal 
p-values will be provided when a pplicable. Descriptive and grap hical summaries by [CONTACT_248117]. Any additional sensitivity and/or  supplemental analyses will be 
defined in the SAP. 
9.2.2 Analysis of Safety 
The Safety Population will be the primary population for the sa fety analyses. All safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively. No statistical inference will  be applied to the s afety endpoints. 
AEs will be categorized by [CONTACT_248133] y Activities (MedDRA) category designations. Summaries of 
AEs, including the number and percentage of participants who ex perience an AE, will be provided. 
Laboratory values will be summarized descriptively, including t he change from baseline, by

the protocol, ICH GCP, Directive 2001/20/EC, applicable regulat ory requirements, and the 
Declaration of Helsinki and that valid data  are entered into th e eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at  the same time, the 
Sponsor in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized , and easily retrievable data. 
Before the enrollment of any participant in this study, the Spo nsor or their designee will review 
with the Investigator and site personnel the following document s: protocol, Investigator’s 
Brochure, eCRFs and procedures for their completion, informed c onsent process, and the 
procedure for reporting SAEs. 
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor or their designee to m onitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During 
the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will b e verified against source 
documents and requests for clarif ication or correction may be m ade. After the eCRF data is entered 
by [CONTACT_779], the CRA will review the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, and 
logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarific ation or correction will be sent to 
Investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expec ted to cooperate with the monitor and 
provide any missing informa tion, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigati onal site by [CONTACT_248135]-specifi c monitoring log. 
11.[ADDRESS_301654]  be available for inspection b y the Sponsor or their designee, 
applicable foreign health authorities, and the IRB/IEC as appro priate. Participants or their legal 
representatives may request their medical information be given to their personal physician or other 
appropriate medical personnel resp onsible for th eir welfare. 
Participant medical information obtained during the study is confidential and disclosure to third parties other than those  noted above is prohibited. 
11.7 Retention of Records 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator will keep records, including the identity of all participants ( sufficient information to link records, 
eg, eCRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed ICFs, copi [INVESTIGATOR_64349], SAE forms, source 
documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The records should be retained by [CONTACT_248136],  local regulations,  or as specified in 
the Clinical Study Agreement, w hichever is longer. The Investig ator must obtain written 
permission from the Sponsor before disposing of any records, ev en if retention requirements have 
been met. 
If the Investigator relocates, re tires, or for any reason withd raws from the study, the Sponsor should 
be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferre d to an acceptable designee, such 
as another Investigator, anothe r institution, or to the Sponsor .

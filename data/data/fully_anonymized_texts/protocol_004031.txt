TITLE OF STUDY : 
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, Randomized, Outpatient Two- period 
Two-treatment  Crossover Study to Evaluate the Eff icacy and Safety of Amifampridine Phosphate 
(3,4- Diaminopyridine  Phosphate ) in Patients with certain Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes 
(CMS)  amenable to treatment.  
PROTOCOL NUMBER : 
CMS -001 
STUDY SITE :  
Multicenter at up to 5 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  and 3  sites in Canada  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT : 
Phase 3  
OBJECTIVES:  
• To characterize the overall safety and tolerability of amifampridi ne phosphate  compared with  
placebo in patients with CMS ; and  
• To assess the clinical efficacy of amifampridine phosphate  compared with placebo in patients 
with CMS , based on improvement in subject global impression (SGI) and motor function 
measure (MFM 20  or 32) scores.  
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN:  
This randomized (1:1), double -blind, placebo- controlled, outpatient two -period , two -treatment 
crossover study is  designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety  of amifampridine phosphate  in 
patients diagnosed with certain genetic subtypes of CMS  and demonstrated open label 
(amifampridine phosphate) or history of sustained amifampridine  benefit from treatment . After a 
period of unblinded drug escalation/treatment, blinded treatment effect will be assessed in a 
randomized fas hion of continuation or cessation of drug , each blinded treatment period separated 
by a stabilization period . The study is planned to include up to [ADDRESS_46681] procedures/assessments (see Table 3 ) completed on Day  1 of the 
run-in period. Patients who are previously naïve to amifampridine ( 3,4-DAP ) or amifampridine 
phosphate treatment will then begin open- label up- titration of medication, with frequent clinic 
visits /telephone  evaluation for up to [ADDRESS_46682] be demonstrated efficacy as assessed by [CONTACT_44475] 20 or 32 in order for the 
patient to participate in the randomized two -period, two- treatment crossover portion of the study .  
Patients on a  stable dose of amifampridine phosphate with a history of meaningful 
improvement in motor function are eligible immediately for randomization. Those who are 
on a stable pre- trial dose of 3,4-DAP  will be transitioned to equivalent dose of amifampridine 
phosphate for 7 days. At this point ( labeled Day  0) the patient will be randomized to a Treatment 
Sequence and undergo procedures/assessments ( Table 3 ). Study medication at the stable dose or 
placebo, will be dispensed by [CONTACT_7232], according to the randomization schedule, 
beginning with the dose following completion of assessments on Day 0 and  for the 8 day Period 1.  
Following experimental P eriod 1, patients will be returned to the stable dose administered at the 
end of the open- label run -in period from days 9 -21, follow ed by [CONTACT_29621] 2 dosing for 8 days  (Days 
22-29). Patients who were on a stable does of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful 
improvement prior to randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose from 
days 9 -21, followed by [CONTACT_29621] 2 dosing for 8 days (Days 22 -29).  
After co mpletion of Period 2, patients will be eligible for expanded access with restoration of open-
label amifampridine phosphate at the same dose and frequency as established in the run -in phase of 
the study. Patients who were on stable dose of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful 
improvement prior to randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose and 
frequency during their participation in the expanded access program.   
Open -label Run -in 
Patients who are naïve to amifampridine or amifampridine phosphate treatment are each potentially 
eligible, but the pathway to enrollment depends upon previous drug exposure and efficacy. For 
those naïve to either, a mifampridine phosphate  dose may  be titrated upward every [ADDRESS_46683] 7 days  with demonstrated 20% or greater improvement in MFM  20 or 32 (depending on the 
age of patient)  compared to  Day 1 r un-in assessment . 
 CMS -001

Proprietary and Confidential   26 June 2017  
Patients al ready receiving 3,4-DAP  or amifampridine phosphate  treatment for CMS , and  meeting 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria are elig ible to participate in this study . The patient should 
report or investigator judges there is a history of improvement on 3,4- DAP  or amifampridine 
phosphate treatment ; improvement of at least 20% in MFM [ADDRESS_46684] 1 week before being random ized to a Treatment Sequence .   
Treatment Group A or B  
Period 1 (Days 1 -8) (+1 day)  
Patients who have successfully completed the open- label run- in and continue to meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized (1:1 ratio)  on the last day of the run -in period 
(Day  0) to either Sequence 1 or 2 and commence Period  1 for the respective Treatment Sequence . 
Only after assessments are completed on Day  0, the patient will begin to receive either 
amifampridine phosphate  tablets or placebo tablets for 8 days as an outpatient , with a  dose of the 
same medication on the day of scheduled study visit ( Day 8 ) in the clinic , in order to facilitate 
efficacy assessments, under double -blind conditions. If the patient is on a BID or TID reg imen 
during P eriod 1, the Day 8 assessments should occur after the same dose that corresponds to when 
assessments were done on Day 0.  Any unused portion of double -blind dispensed drug will be 
returned to the  site before dispensing drug for the Re -Stabilization Period.   
Re-Stabilization Period  (Days 9-21) (+1 day)  
Patients will be administered amifampridine phosphate  at the same dose and frequency established 
as the stable dose in the open -label run- in phase for a 14- day period, under open- label conditions.  
Patients who were on stable dose of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful 
improvement prior to randomization in study CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose 
and frequency during the re -stabilization period.  
Period 2 (Days 22 -29) (+1 day)  
After completion of Period 1 and the re-stabilization period, according to randomization sequence, 
patients will receive the blinded study medication/placebo for Period 2 for 8 days (Day 22 – 29) as 
an outpatient with  a dose of the same medication on the day of scheduled study visit (Day 29 ) in 
the clinic , in order to facilitate efficacy assessments, under double -blind conditions. If the patient is 
on a BID or TID reg imen during P eriod 2, the Day 29 assessments should occur after the same 
dose that corresponds to when assessments were done on Day 0 . Any unused portion of double -
blind dispensed drug wi ll be returned to the site  before enrolling the patient in the expanded access 
program and dispensing open- label drug.  
During all phases of the study, safety and efficacy assessments will be performed  as detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments in Table 3  and Section 13.  
NUMBER OF PATIEN TS PLANNED:  
Approximately 23 patients to enroll in  the study.

Proprietary and Confidential 26 June 2017  
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy will be described for 2 datasets:  
•Full Analysis Set (FAS): This population consists of all randomized patients who receive
at least 1 dose of IP ( amifampridine phosphate or placebo) and have at least one post-
treatment efficacy assessment.
•Per Protocol (PP): This population is a subset of the FAS population, excluding patientswith major protocol deviations.
If the PP Population is the same as the FAS, then the results will be presented only for the FAS. 
Exclusion from the FAS and PP Population will be finalized prior to database lock and 
subsequent unblinding. 
Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_44478]- I, CGI-S, Change From 
Baseline (CFB) for CGI -S, the optional Slurp Test, and variables associated with the optional 
SFEMG.  
T
he analysis of CFB for SGI is the primary efficacy analysis and will be performed using the 
standard analysis for a 2 -by-2 crossover design. Summary statistics for SGI and CFB for SGI 
will be presented by [CONTACT_44479]. P- values <0.05 wil be considered statistically 
significant.  
T

8 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive r eview of amifampridine phosphate  is contained in the Firdapse® 
Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_44486]  (February 2015) . Investigators are to review this 
document before  initiating this study.  
8.1 Disease Background  
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the specialized synapse between the motor nerve 
terminal and the muscle fiber. Defects in NMJ function present with variable and often 
fluctuant symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, droopy eyelids, double vision, 
swallowing and breathing difficulties. NM J disorders are both inherited and acquired in 
nature. Congenital myastheni c syndromes (CMS) are a group of heterogeneous inherited 
disorders caused by [CONTACT_44487]. Most CMS  are caused by [CONTACT_44488], but they can also be caused by [CONTACT_44489], mutation in proteins associated with the synaptic basal lamina, defects in endplate 
development and maintenance, or defects in protein glycosylation (Engel, 2007) . More than 
[ADDRESS_46700] been described.  
CMS is rare, estimated at one- tenth that of myasthenia gravis, which in itself is rare 
(estimated at 25 to 125 per million) ( Eymard, 2013; Abicht, 2012). Worldwide, 
approximately 2,[ADDRESS_46701] been diagnosed on a molecular level (Schara, 
2012) . A recent report on genetically -confirmed CMS cases in the [LOCATION_008] indicates 
a prevalence of 9.2 per million in children under 18 years of age, equally affecting girls and 
boys (Parr, 2014) . 
CMS is characterized by [CONTACT_44490] (ocular, bulbar, limb 
muscles), with an onset typi[INVESTIGATOR_44438], although rarely it can manifest 
in adolescence and adulthood ( Abicht, 2012; Schara, 2012). Clinically, hypotonia is 
common, as are ophthalmoplegia and ptosis, dysphonia and swallowing disturbance, facial 
paresis, and progressive muscle weakness ( Eymar d, 2013; Abicht, 2012).  The severity and 
clinical course of the disease are highly variable, reflective of the underlying genetic defect.  
The diagnosis and management of children with CMS is challenging and response to 
treatment in  CMS depends on the type of defect (pre -synaptic, synaptic , post -synaptic) and 
the kinetics of the channel affected (fast versus slow). Most patients are eligible and respond 
to pharmacologic intervention, including esterase inhibitors, 3,4- diaminopyridine  (3,4- DAP), 
 CMS -001

ephedrine, fluoxetine or quinidine, and albuterol ( Eymard, 2013; Abicht, 2012; Schara, 2012; 
Engel, 2007 ). The particular therapy is dictated by  [CONTACT_44491], as drugs 
beneficial in one subtype can be detrimental in another subtype .

Amifampridine (3,4- DAP) is a non- specific voltage -dependent potassium (K+) channel 
blocker used to treat many of the congenital myasthenic syndromes, particularly those with 
defects in choline acetyltransferase, downstream kinase 7, and those where any kind of defect 
causes “fast channel” behavior of the AChR. Its blockade of K+ channels causes 
depolarization of the presynaptic membrane and s lows down or inhibits the repolarization  
phase of an action potential . Prolong ation of the action potential duration increased opening 
of pre -synaptic slow voltage -dependent calcium (Ca2+) channels , increasing  Ca2+ influx and 
consequent increase in synapt ic vesicle exocytosis (quantal content) with each depolarization 
event , thus releasing an increased level of ACh into the synaptic cleft ( Maddison, 1998a ; 
Maddison, 1998b)  The influx of ACh into the presynaptic cleft enhances neuromuscular 
transmission, providing improved muscle function  in those cases of CMS where defects of 
diminished post -synaptic response are demonstrated or postulated.  
Over the last 25 years, a considerable amount of clinical experience with amifampridine has 
been gained, which provides a strong body of evidence for its efficacy and safety in the 
treatment of patients with neurologic disorders, including MG, CMS, Lambert -Eaton 
myasthenic syndrome (LEMS),  multiple sclerosis (MS), d ownbeat nystagmus, and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Amifampridine has been recommended as first -line 
symptomatic treatment for LEMS  by [CONTACT_44492] 
(EFNS) ( Skeie, 2006; Skeie, 2010; Lindquist, 2011)  and amifampridine tablets 10 mg  (as 
amifampridine phosphate ) (Firdapse® Tablets) is marketed for the treatment of LEMS in the 
European Union (including Norway and Iceland), Israel, and Switzerl and. The collective 
body of data indicates that amifampridine/ amifampridine phosphate is well tolerated up to 
and including 80 mg/day ( Firdapse Investigator Brochure, February 2015).  
8.3 Nonclinical Studies  
An extensive nonclinical program assessed the safety  and absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of amifampridine , 
including:

The main nonclinical findings of CNS and ANS effects and histologic changes in muscle 
tissues after administration of amifampridine are in accordance with the mechanism of 
action. No new treatment -related findings in the nonclinical program have been observed  that 
would limit the use of amifampridine at the planned clinical maximum daily oral dose of 60 
mg (≤16 years of age) and 80 mg (>16 years of age) in this study involving patients with 
CMS . 
8.4 Previous Clinical Studies  
Amifampridine  has been used for over 25 years in patients with multiple neurologic disorders 
including MG, CMS , LEMS , MS, ALS, congenital forms of nystagmus , and adult idiopathic 
nystagmus (AIN) . There are a limited number of published controlled trials with 
amifampridine in these disorders. A review of the literature documents that amifampridine is 
a safe and effective treatment in multiple neurologic disorders and is recommended by [CONTACT_44493] -line symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS  (Skeie, 2006; Skeie, 2010; 
Lindquist, 2011) . 
 CMS -[ADDRESS_46703] in human Phase 1 study (DAPSEL  Study, 2006) with amifampridine phosphate was 
conducted to investigate the bioavailability/bioequi valence and tolerability of amifampridine 
administered as a phosphate salt or free base. In the first part of the study, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_44439] 5 healthy male volunteers who received a single 10 -mg dose of 
amifampridine phosphate to deter mine tolerability. In the second part of the study, 
bioequivalence testing was conducted in 27 healthy male volunteers. Each patient was 
randomized to receive either a single dose (2 ×  10 mg tablets) of amifampridine as 
amifampridine phosphate or amifampri dine base and received alternate treatment following a 
minimum of 72 -hour washout period. 
This study demonstrated bioequivalence for  area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
from time 0 to infinity  (AUC 0-∞), with the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the base/salt ratio 
of 93.1%  to 113.3% falling within the predefined limits of 90% to 125% for bioequivalence. 
The mean elimination half -life ( t1/2) of amifampridine was 1.8  hours for the phosphate and 
1.6 hours for the  free base form . Amifampridine C max was 64.8 ng/mL for the phosphate and 
57.0 ng/mL for the free base form. Potentially improved absorption of the phosphate salt 
explained the slightly higher C max observed for amifampridine phosphate compared with the 
free base.  All adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate, transitory and fully reversible . 
The nature and frequency of side -effects did not differ between formulations (phosphate salt 
or base) . The most common AE (25 of 40 AEs) was paresthesia, which was mainly minor 
peri-oral paresthesia. Since paresthesia is well recognized as an AE occurring in patients 
treated with amifampridine, all were considered as possibly related to  investigational product 
(IP) by [CONTACT_093]. The only other AE occurring in >1 patient and judged possibly 
related to  amifampridine was abdominal pain (4 events). Simple flu (5 events) and feeling of 
discomfort (2 events) were also reported for >  1 patient in the study, however were 
considered not related to amifampridine treatment.  
The only SAEs reported in the study we re minor, isolated, and reversible increases in 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which occurred in a 
single patient after administration of 20  mg amifampridine base . Aside from this 1 patient, no 
other laboratory abnorma lities were observed. No electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities 
were observed. No deaths occurred in the DAPSEL study.  
A Phase 1 study (LMS -001) in healthy volunteers evaluated whether food consumption 
significantly affected  the bioavailability of amifampr idine phosphate tablets. This was  an 
open- label, randomized, single -dose, 2- treatment, 2- period crossover design in [ADDRESS_46704] . The 2 single 20 mg doses 
of amifampridine phosphate were administered 6 days apart . Data indicate that taking 
amifampridine with food reduces exposures determined by C max (maximum serum levels) by 
[CONTACT_3450]  40% and AUC by [CONTACT_3450]  20%. In addition, the time to maximum 
serum concen trations (T max) was increased 2 -fold from approximately  38 minutes (fasted ) to 
78 minutes (fed) . The drug was well tolerated with no ser ious adverse events and only [ADDRESS_46705] common 
adverse events occurring in ≥  10% of patient s were: oral paresthesia (20  patients ; 43%),  
peripheral paresthesias (12; 26%), dizziness (5;  11%), headache (5;  11%), and oral 
hypoesthesia (5; 11%) . Abdominal pain, nausea, peripheral paresthesias, dizziness, and 
headache were more commonly reported by [CONTACT_4676] s following administration of 
amifampridine phosphate in the fasted state ; therefore, a dministration with food is 
recommended  based on the current study . 
In both Study LMS -001 and DAPSEL, PK parameters were highly variable with 10- fold 
ranges observed in values of C max, AUC, and t ½ across patient s. In humans, a mifampridine is  
exclusively met abolized to a single major  metabolite, 3- N-acetyl amifampridine , via N -acetyl 
transferases (NAT ) (Catalyst  internal in vitro  and in vivo  studies; data available upon 
request). There are [ADDRESS_46706] been well characterized in the Caucasian and Asian 
populations , but somewhat less well in African populations ( Sabbagh, 2006 ). Slow 
acetylators are estimated to comprise 50 % to 59% of the Caucasian population, w ith the 
remainder being rapid acety lators (fast + intermediate) . Fast acetylators are o ver represented 
in Asian population (92% of Japanese and 80% of Chinese) while they may be under 
represented in African populations (25%)  (Cascorbi, 1995).  Slow acetylators will accumulate 
drug to higher  levels (i .e. higher C max) and clear drug more slowly (i .e. longer t 1/2), both of 
which may increase the risk of drug related  toxicity (Fukino, 2008; Jetter, 2009) . It is 
hypothesized that  the high variability in amifampridine phosphate PK may be due to NAT 
polymorphism s with slow and fast acetylator  phenotypes. In a study (FIR -001) that evaluated 
the effect of acetylator status  in 26 healthy subjects (half with fast and half with slow 
acetylator phenotypes) , polymorphisms in the NAT system created 3-  to 4- fold differences in 
plasma amifampridine levels.  Potentially information relating NAT genotype and 
amifampridine phosphate PK could be used to inform dose selection for individual patients  
and to lower incidence of dose -related side effects . 
 CMS -[ADDRESS_46707] reports being case series or case reports.  An open 
prospective trial conducted by [CONTACT_44494] ( 1991) reported improvement with oral 
3,4-DAP in c ongenital myasthenia syndrome in 16 patients ( 8 males and 8 females ) ranging 
in age from 7 to 47 years. All but  1 patient showed improvement in strength scores, and the 
group as a whole showed highly significant increase in muscle strength. Although this study 
included younger patients, only 2 patients  were less than 10 years of age, and genetic 
etiology for congenital myasthenia was unknown with outcome measures largely dependent 
on patient cooperation and motivation. One death of 5- year-old girl with severe congenial 
myasthenia who developed fatal pneumonia after several weeks of 3,4 -DAP, though not 
thought to hav e contributed to this event. Anlar and colleagues ( 1996 ) conducted a double -
blinded, placebo- controlled, crossover study investigating the effects of 3,4 -DAP in 11 
patients ( 5-24 years  of age)  with either a diagnosis of congenital myasthenia gravis (CMG) or 
juvenile myasthenia gravis (JMS). None of the [ADDRESS_46708] been identified. Harper and Enge l’s open- label uncontrolled study ( 2000) was the first 
to look at patients with different mutation forms of CMS. With a total of [ADDRESS_46709]  of AC hR deficiency patients had sustained improvement. A  handful of case reports and 
case series has also shown the efficacy of 3,4 -DAP in different mutation forms of CMS . 
Beeson and colleagues  (2005) reported 19 patients with CMS who received 3,4- DAP (doses 
not specified), with 15 maintained on their existing anti- AChE medication. Good response to 
3,4-DAP was observed in CMS due to mut ations of the following genes: MuSK (n=1), 
CHRNE  (n=4), COLQ (n=1), RAPSN  (n=1), and unknown (n=6). For the patient with COLQ-
CMS, a positive effect was found at 26 years of age, with a clear gain of ax ial and limb 
strength. In a single report  (Mazell, 2015) , use of 3,4- DAP in a 4 -year-old girl with well -
defined CHRNE -CMS  showed promising results  using stimulated jitter analysis and MFM  
score as outcome measures. In long- term follow -up of 15 COLQ- CMS patients  ranging in 
age from 3 to 48 years  (mean 19  years) , all relapses ended spontaneously or with 3,4- DAP 
(30 to 60 mg daily) or ephedrine with no residual impairment  (Wargon, 2012) . Associated

respi[INVESTIGATOR_44440] 3 of the 8 patients. From a pediatric stand point, this 
adverse event was significant as puberty was identified as a triggering factor in 6 of 
8 patients.  
Two children with RAPSN -CMS improved clinically with the addition of 3,4- DAP in 
conjunction with pyridostigmine  (Banwell, 2004) . Clinically, both children manifested with 
hypomotility in  utero , fatigable ocular and limb weakness since birth, decreased strength 
during viral illness, decremental response on EMG, and absence of AChR antibodies. One 
child had a more sev ere clinical course with recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_44441], 
contractures, and craniofacial malformations. The addition of 3,4- DAP in this 14- year-old 
boy led to increased endurance and a marked reduction in fatigable weakness. In the second 
child, a 9 -year-old girl maintained on pyridostigmine since 4 months of age, experienced 
significant improvement in endurance after treatment with 3,4- DAP, allowing for increased 
activity (i.e.  jump rope, run, participate in dance, ride a horse). In another repor t of 11 
patients with RAPSN -CMS , addition of 3,4- DAP to the pyridostigmine regimen resulted  in 
further clinical improvement (Milone, 2009) . 
Four reports have evaluated 3,4- DAP in DOK -7-CMS. Ben Ammar and colleagues (2010)  
found that 7 of 9 patients (5 males, 4 females ranging in age from 18 to 69 years) improved 
on 3,4- DAP alone (doses not specified). In another report (Anderson, 2008)  where 3 patients 
received 3,4- DAP a lone (doses not specified) and 3 patients  received 3,4- DAP in 
combination with pyridostigmine  or ephedrine , all 6 patients improved with treatment.  
Selcen and colleagues  (2008)  report 9  patients (3 males, 6 females ranging in age from 5 to 
50 years) who received 3,4 -DAP alone (n=4), or in combination with pyridostig mine (n=3) 
or ephedrine (n=2). One of the 2 children improved on 3, 4-  DAP (10  mg TID), whereas the 
other child became worse after 3,4 -DAP (5  mg TID) was added to her pyridostigmine 
regimen ; 4 of 7 adults improved. Lashley and colleagues (2010)  report follow -up of 10 
patients with DOK -7-CMS mainly treated with ephedrine, with 2 patients (29 and 42 years of 
age) continued on 3,4 -DAP treatment (15 or 30 mg QID). All patients improved over [ADDRESS_46710] to DPAGT1 -CMS , Finlayson and colleagues (2013)  report 5 patients (2 males, 
3 females ranging in age from 6 to 58 years) , with 2 of 3 patients who received 3,4- DAP 
(doses not specified) ha ving a favorable response to treatment. In another report, 2 children 
(both girls, 13 and 14 years of age) who received 3,4- DAP did not improve:  one was  on 
3,4-DAP (30  mg/day) plus pyridostigmine and the other on 3,4- DAP (10 mg)  (Selecen, 
2014) .

Two patients (7 and 48 years of age) with presynaptic CMS (with reduced quantal release) 
who had severe generalized  weakness since early infancy  initially responded to 3,4- DAP 
(dose not specified) and pyridostigmine, but then became refrac tory to treatment (Beeson, 
2005) . Both patients were wheelchair -bound and had multiple skeletal deformities. The 
younger patient could not speak or swallow and was respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] -dependent . In another report 
(Kinali, 2008) , 4 of 5 children with CMS who received pyridostigmine and 3,4- DAP (doses 
not specified ) showed a positive response.  
8.4.3 Efficacy of Amifampridine in LEMS  
A Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study (LMS -002) evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of amifampridine tablets 10 mg, as amifampridine phosphate (30- 80 mg 
total daily dose)  versus placebo in patients with LEMS . The  study has  [ADDRESS_46711] 
3 parts complete in the clinic (open -label extension ongoing). P atients treated with 
amifampridine phosphate had stat istically significant improvement in both primary efficacy 
measures relative to patients treated with placebo. The  change in QMG scores from baseline 
(Day 1, Part  2) to Day 14 (Part 3) reached statistical significance  (p=0.0452), with the least 
square (LS) mean for QMG score increasing by 2.[ADDRESS_46712] 
global impression ( SGI), patients who were receiving amifampridine on Day  1 reported, on 
average, that they were “pleased” (SGI score of 5.9  ± 1.2) with the test medication while they

average, 2.7 ±2.3 points. The LS mean was -2.6 for the placebo group and - 0.8 for the 
amifampridine group, a difference of 1.8 ±0.6 (p=0.0028), corresponding to a patient 
assessment, of “mixed” for the placebo tablets. This substantial change in patients’ 
assessments, to a worsening of their condition while receiving placebo, was considered 
clinically significant.  
In addition to Study LMS -002, 5 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled studies and 
1 double -blind study with an active comparator (reported in abstract form only) in 71 patients 
with LEMS are reported in the clinical literature . In all 6  studies, amifampridine (in base 
form) was shown to be more effective for the symptomatic tre atment of  LEMS compared 
with placebo or active comparator across a number of independent measures of neurological 
function. Supportive data  from multiple published uncontrolled investigations and case 
reports demonstrate the long -term benefits of treatment with amifampridine in patients with 
LEMS , and show that removal of patients from drug has led to recurrence of underlying

symptoms. Refer to the Firdapse Investigator Brochure (February , 2015)  for further details 
on these studies. 
8.4.4 Safety of Amifampridine and Amifampridine Phosphate  
Safety data collected from 1,454 patien ts or healthy volunteers in controlled study LMS -002 
(LEMS)  described above in Section  8.4.3, controlled and uncontrolled published studies  of 
LEMS or other neurologic conditions , a 3-year safety surveillance study (ATU), and PK 
studies demonstrate amifampridine is well tolerated up to and including 80 mg/day  (Firdapse 
Investigator Brochure, February 2015 ). The most common adverse events observed from the 
clinical safety data were perioral and peripheral par esthesias and gastrointestinal disorders  
(abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, epi[INVESTIGATOR_44443] ).  These events were typi[INVESTIGATOR_44444], and transient, seldom requiring dose reduction or withdrawal from 
treatment.  In the pharmacogenomic study in healthy subjects (classified as either slow 
acetylators or fast acetylators), slow acetylators experienced >80% more drug -related AEs 
compared with fast acetylators (FIR -001).  
Clinically significant or s erious adverse events were infrequent in all studies for all 
indications. A total of 12 deaths were reported in the 1,454 patients or healthy s ubjects. Six 
of 12 deaths were ass ociated with accompanying malignancy (1 of 6 with pulmonary 
embolus as terminal event), 1 due to tracheobronchitis, and 2 due to myocardial infarction 
(MI).  Attribution to amifampridine for 2 of 3 deaths  from the ATU study was specified as 
unrelated; causality for the third death was not reported. No attribution was specified in the 
academic series, but the author singled out the fatal MI as the only serious incident during 
amifampridine therapy, implying that the 2  deaths due to malignancy, the 1 due to 
malignancy and pulmonary embolus and the 1 due to tracheobronchitis were not related in 
his opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The author further states that no pathological findings related to amifampridine 
were found in the patient who died of tracheobronchitis. For 1 of the fatal MIs, the author 
speculates that a “sudden increase of physical activity” with amifampridine may have been a 
contributant  (Lundh, 1984; Lundh, 1993) ; no causality was reported for the other fatal MI 
(Bertorini, 2011) . Three deaths occurred in children with CMS, including [ADDRESS_46713] -channel 
CMS (Beeson, 2005) . Although no causal relationship was established with amifampridine, 
the authors advise its use cautiously in children and in fast -channel patients. The other CMS 
death was not thought to be related to amifampridine (Palace, 1991) . Overall 7 of 12 deaths 
were not considered related  to amifampridine; neither cause nor causality is known for 4 
deaths; and amifampridine may have contributed indirectly to [ADDRESS_46714] frequent clinically significant or serious e vent was seizure. A total of 10 ( 0.69%) 
patients out of 1,454 patients or healthy subjects experienced seizures or convulsions after 
treatment with amifampridine. E lectroencephalogram  findings, reported for 3 of the 10 
patients, did not show epi[INVESTIGATOR_44445] a ctivity. Three of 10 seizures occurred in patients with 
LEMS (3/ 209; 1.44%), 4  occurred in patients with MS (4/774; 0.5%), 1 occurred in a patient 
with CMS (1/88; 1.14%) (Harper, 2000)  and 2 seizures were reported in a literature -based 
study where both MG and LEMS patients were enrolled, but the paper did not state the 
indication  (Sanders, 1993; Sanders, 2000; Flet, 2010; McEvoy, 1989; Boerma, 1995;  Bever, 
1996) . No seizures have been reported in patients or healthy volunteers taking Firdapse since 
its commercial approval in December [ADDRESS_46715] 4 of these cases of seizure. Three patients 
experienced seizures on a daily dose of ≥90 mg/day (n=3; LEMS or MG). No other cause 
was apparent in 2 cases; 1 patient had concurrent toxi c serum levels of theophylline 
(McEvoy, 1989; Sanders, 1993) . A fourth patient with LEMS had multiple seizures 
following accidental ingestion of 360 mg/day amifampridine for  7 days (prescribed dose 
60 mg/day)  (Boerma, 1995) . There were potentially contributing conditions in 6 patients, 
specifically, concurrent treatment with theophylline (n=1; LEMS or MG), or coexistent brain 
metastases (n=1; LEMS), epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (n=1; MS) and MS (n=4). In cases where follow -up was 
reported, most seizure s did not recur with amifampridine dose reduction or treatment 
withdrawal. In the one accidental overdose case, seizures were controlled with intravenous 
clonazepam and the patient made a full recovery  (Boerma, 1995) . Note that a s eizure rate of 
4% can be expected in the natu ral course of patients with MS (Engelsen, 1997; Moreau, 
1998; Kinnunen, 1987) . Among the 774 MS patient s treated with amifampridine  included in 
the safety asses sment  of this report , 4 (0.5%) experienced seizures.  
Other clinically significant or S AEs reported in more than 1 adult  patient were palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] 
(8/1,454; 0.56%), abnormal liver enzymes ( 6/1,454; 0.41%), QTc prolongation (2/ 1,454; 
0.14%), and premature ventricular contraction/increased ventricular extrasystoles (2/ 1,454; 
0.14%). Each of the following serious or clinically significant events was reported in a single 
patient: chorea, paresthesias, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, dr ug-
induced hepatitis , gastroesophageal reflux, increased lipase and amylase, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_44446], and urinary t ract infection with confusion. 
Based upon the previous clinical studies involving the use of amifampridine in the treatment 
of La mbert -Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), there have been reports of provocation of 
bronchial asthma, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], or respi[INVESTIGATOR_44447].  These events are also part of 
 CMS -001

Proprietary and Confidential   26 June 2017  
CMS symptoms; however, the risk may be more likely when the patient has asthma or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_44448] a comorbidity with CMS. 
8.5 Overall Risks and Benefits  
Data on amifampridine treatment in 1,454 patients or healthy volunteers support the 
favorable safety profile of amifampridine (both base and phosphate formulations) at doses up 
to [ADDRESS_46716] been minimized by:  
1. Patients enter ing the study may already be on some formulation of 3,4-
diaminopyridine and have demonstrated tolerability or;  
2. Patients naïve to the medication are titrated to a tolerable and effective dose with 
open -label medication, under the observation of the Investigator.  Thus, the 
development of adverse events or lack of efficacy is monitored by [CONTACT_44495] t he step -wise titration and study medication dose can be reduced or 
discontinued at any point in the titration for either safety or lack of efficacy.   
The pharmacokinetic half -life of amifampridine phosphate is short (1.8 hours), 
therefore discontinuation of medication will qickly terminate the effects, and mitigate 
adverse reactions.  
This is a withdrawal study design looking at patient worsening on placebo; which is 
possible due to the short half -life of amifampridine phosphate. Therefore, patients must 
demonstrate a level of efficacy during the open -label titration period.  This further 
reduces patient risk, by [CONTACT_44496] a benefit.  
During the placebo withdrawal period, patients who deter iorate to a point that the 
Investigator assess to be lower than their baseline, open -label amifampridine phosphate 
is provided as to rescue the patient.  
Refer to the Firdapse Investigator Brochure ( February, 2015)  for further information on 
benefit/risk o f amifampridine.  
 CMS -[ADDRESS_46717] shown clinical benefit as described above in Section 8.4.2. Little controlled data 
are reported , and s everal of the se studies had patient s without genetic confirmation of CMS 
and lacked sensitive , objec tive, motor and electrophysiologic outcome measu res to study 
efficacy . In light of above mentioned advancements in field of genetics, electrophysiological 
techniques, and motor function measures, a randomized placebo- control led trial of  3,4-DAP 
in CMS patients is warranted . Thus, the purpose of this study ( CMS -001) is to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of amifampridine phosphate  in patients  diagnosed with subtypes of CMS.  
9 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
9.1 Primary  Objective s 
The primary objective s of the study are: 
• To characterize the overall safety and tolerability of amifampridine phosphate  
compared with placebo in patients with CMS; and  
• To assess the clinical efficacy of amifampridine phosphate  compared with placebo in 
patients with CMS , based on improvement in subject global impression (SGI) and 
motor function measur e (MFM 20  or 32) scores . 
10 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
10.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a randomized (1:1), double -blind, placebo -controlled, outpatient  two-period two-
treatment crossover study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety  of amifampridine 
phosphate  in patients ( 2 years of age  and above ) diagnosed with CMS . The study is planned 
to be conducted at up to [ADDRESS_46718] up to 
14 days.   
All patients ( parent or legal guardian ) who  sign an informed consent  will be screened for 
eligibility to participate in the study, including: inclusion and exclusion criteria; medical and 
medication history; complete physical exam; standard 12- lead ECG; laboratory testing; 
serum pregnancy testing (females of childbearing potential only ; result must be  negative to

proceed into the run- in period with open- label IP administration ); and CMS genetic testing 
(if not previously done or available) .  
Those patients successfully completing initial screening will have procedures/assessments 
(see Table 3 ) conducted on Day  1 of the run -in period. Those not previously on 3,4- DAP  or 
amifampridine phosphate  will then embark on an open label up- titration of amifampridine 
phosphate dose based upon clinical benefit (assessed at clinic visit and telephone solicitation)  
for up to [ADDRESS_46719] demonstrable increase of MFM  20 or 
MFM  32 scores of  >20% during this period of open label uptitration of dose, patients will 
then be randomized to a Treatment Sequence on last day of open -label run -in period ( Day 0 ).  
Patients already receiving 3,4 -DAP or amifampridine phosphate treatment for CMS, and 
meeting the applicable inclusion and exclusion criteria are eligible to participate in this study. 
The patient should report or investigator judges there is a history of meaningful improvement 
in motor function on 3,4- DAP or amifampridine phosphate treatment; improvement of at 
least 20% in MFM [ADDRESS_46720] 1 week before being randomized to a 
Treatment Sequence. T hose patients who are on a stable dose of 3,4- DAP  will be transitioned 
to equivalent dose of amifampridine phosphate for 7 days prior to randomization to 
treatment.    
Procedures/assessments, as detailed in Table 3 , will be conducted before  starting Period 1 
study medication (i.e. Day 0). Administration of Period 1 study medication (amifampridine 
phosphate  or placebo)  begins after all assessments have been completed on Day 0. Every 
attempt should be made to have the same individual perform all assessments for a patient 
throughout the study , and after the same dos e used for Day 0 assessments. Following P eriod 
1, patients will be returned to the same stable do se administered at the end of the open -label 
run-in period for days 9 -21, followed by [CONTACT_29621] 2 dosing for 8 days.  Patients who were on a 
stable does of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful improvement prior to 
randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose from days 9 -21, 
followed by [CONTACT_29621] 2 dosing for 8 days. After completion of of  the study, patients will be 
eligible for expanded access program and receive open -label amifampridine phosphate at the 
same dose and frequency as established in the run- in phase of the study. Patients who were 
on stable dose of amifampriding phosphate wit h a history of meaningful improvement prior 
to randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose and frequency during

Following successful completion of the Run- in and randomization on Day  0, study visits will 
occur on Day  8 (+1  day) , Day  21 (+1 day) , and Day 29 (+1  day)  or, if applicable, e arly 
discontinuation from the study . Note that should a shift in days occur (i.e. +1 day), then rest 
of schedule must shift to keep sequence and stabilization periods constant. 
Safety and efficacy assessments will be made throughout the study as detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments in Table [ADDRESS_46721] a 20% interval improvement  in M FM 20 or 32 ( scale use 
depends  upon the age of patient) , compared to Day  [ADDRESS_46722] a medical

Treatment Group A or B  
Perio d 1 (Day s 1-8) (+1 day)  
Patients who successfully complete the open -label run- in and continue to meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized (1:1  ratio) on the last day of the run- in period 
(Day  0) to either Sequence 1 or 2. Subjects randomized to Sequence 1 will receive Treatment 
A (amifampridine phosphate  or placebo) in Period 1  and Treatment B ( the other treatment) in 
Period 2. Subjects randomized to Sequence 2 will receive Treatment B ( amifampridine or 
placebo) in Period 1 and Treatment A ( the other treatment ) in Period 2. Study medication 
(amifampridine phosphate  tablets or placebo tablets)  for Period [ADDRESS_46724], according to the randomization schedule.  
The administration  of blinded  medication will begin only after completi on of  all 
assessments of Day 0. The Day 0 assessments are performed while taking a dose of 
open -label amifampridine phosphate in the clinic, 40 minutes before star ting the 
assessment s.   Any supply of open- label amifampridine phosphate should be collected by [CONTACT_44497] 1 blinded medication.   
The patient will receive either blinded amifampridine phosphate tablets or placebo tablets for 
8 days  as an outpatient, and a dose of the same medication on the day of scheduled study 
visit ( Day 8 ) in the clinic, in order to facilitate efficacy assessments, under double -blind 
conditions. If the patient is on a BID or TID regimen during Period 1, the Day [ADDRESS_46725] be administered by [CONTACT_44498] , in the clinic, in order  to perform 
evaluations within specified time periods , as described in Section 10.3.3. 
Re-stabilization  Period  (Days 9- 21) (+1 day)  
After Day 8 in -clinic evaluations, p atients will return to open- label study drug , through Day 
21 (same dose and frequency  as at the end of run- in), as prescribed by i nvestigator and 
dispensed by [CONTACT_44499] . No dose adjustments may occur. Patients who were on 
stable dose of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful improvement prior to 
randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose and frequency during 
the re- stabilization period.

Period 2 (Days 22- 29) (+1 day)  
Study medication will be dispensed by [CONTACT_44500] (i.e. Day  21), according to the randomization schedule. Patients will start the 
blinded study medication only after completi on of all  of the Day 22 assess ments, while 
taking open -label medication , 40 minutes  before starting assessments . 
Per the crossover design, patients will receive  the double -blind study  medication ( either 
amifampridine phosphate  tablets or placebo tablets ) during Period 2, for 8 days (Day 22 – 29 ) 
as an outpatient with a  dose of the same medication on the day of scheduled study visit ( Day 
29), administered by [CONTACT_44501] , to facilitate efficacy assessments, under 
double -blind conditions. If the patient is on a BID or TID reg imen during P eriod 2, the Day 
29 assessments should occur after the same dos e that corresponds to when assessments were 
done on Day 0. Any unused portion of dispensed drug will be returned to the site before 
enrolling the patient in the expanded acc ess ptogram and dispensing open -label drug .

[IP_ADDRESS] Product Characteristics and Labeling  
Drug product is formulated as a phosphate salt of amifampridine. Tablets were developed to 
provide the equivalent of 10 mg of amifampridine base for oral administration. Each tablet 
contains amifampridine phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, and 
calcium stearate. The bottles of tablets are labeled “Amifampridine phosphate  Tablets, 
10 mg .” 
The tab lets are to be dispensed by [CONTACT_44504]. Placebo will be provided as tablets indistinguishable from 
amifampridine phosphate . The amifampridine phosphate  tablets and placebo tablets will be 
clearly labeled and the pharmacist is responsible for dispensing the amifampridine phosphate  
tablets or placebo tablets, as needed, for each patient. 
Each bottle will be labeled to include the compound name , site number, patient ID number, 
date dispensed , storage instructions, the statement ‘Caution – New  Drug – Limited by 
[CONTACT_44505] ,’ trial number, manufacturer name [CONTACT_3816], and area 
for instructions for use.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage  
At the study site, all IP must be stored at room temperature ( 20-25 degrees Celsius ) and in  a 
secure area accessible only to the designated pharmacist and clinical site personnel. All IP 
must be stored and inventoried, and the inventories must be carefully and accurately 
documented according to applicable national and local regulations, ICH GCP, and study 
procedures.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_46739] be administered in the clinic in order to facilitate 
efficacy assessments.  All safety assessments (vital signs, laboratory tests) are to be 
performed before the dose administered to the patient during the scheduled in- clinic visit. All 
efficacy assessments will be performed at standardized times relative to the dose 
administered in the clinic . In this case,  the dose will be [ADDRESS_46740] efficacy

The dose of amifampridine phosphate  will be individually determined by [CONTACT_093], 
within the bounds of a total daily dose of 10 mg to 80 mg , divided into doses taken 2 to 
4 times per day generally taken with food (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack before 
bed) as prescribed by [CONTACT_093] , based on optimal neuromuscular benefit  (see Table 4 ). 
All doses of study medication will be taken orally by [CONTACT_1966], with the following exceptions:  
• children unable to swallow tablets will have the tablets crushed and mixed with a 
small amount of food;  and 
• children with a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube will have the tablets crushed and

The amifampridine phosphate  dose is 10 mg  to 80  mg total daily dose, given in 2 to 4 divided 
doses, with no single dose > 15 mg in patients up to 16 years of age or > 20 mg in patients 
>16 years of age . Safety of a single maxim um dose of 20 mg is based on completed animal 
and in vitro  pharmacology , PK, a nd toxicology studies . 
10.3.6 Blinding  
This is a double -blind study where both the patients  (parent/guardian/caregiver)  and 
investigator will be blinded to treatment assignment. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_46743] Accountability 
The study site pharmacy  is responsible for maintaining accurate records (including dates and 
quantities) of IP(s) received, patients to whom IP is dispensed (patient -by-patient dose 
specific accounting), IP returned, and IP lost or destroyed. The investigator,  study  site 
pharmac y or designee must retain all unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_16744] 
(on-site CRA) has confirmed the accountability data.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_46744] provide an explanation for any destroyed or 
missing IP or study materials.  
Unused IP may be destroyed on site, per the site’s standard operating procedures, but only 
after Catalyst  has grant ed approval for drug destruction. The monitor must account for all IP 
in a formal reconciliation process prior to IP destruction. All IP destroyed on site must be 
documented. Documentation must be provided to Catalyst  and retained in the investigator 
study  files. If a site is unable to destroy IP appropriately, the site can return unused IP to 
Catalyst  upon request. The return of IP or IP materials must be accounted for on a Study 
Drug Return Form provided by [CONTACT_44486] . 
All IP and related materials should be  stored, inventoried, reconciled, and destroyed or 
returned according to applicable regulations and study procedures.

10.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prescription and over -the-counter medications and herbal and nutritional supplements 
taken by a pati ent for 14 days before the Screening visit will be recorded on the designated 
case report form ( CRF ).  
The investigator may prescribe additional medications during the study, as long as the 
prescribed medication is not prohibited by [CONTACT_760]. In the event of an emergency, any 
needed medications may be prescribed without prior approval, but the M edical M onitor must 
be notified of the use of any contraindicated medications immediately thereafter. Any 
concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study should be recorded on the 
CRF.  
Medications prohibited during the study are listed in Table [ADDRESS_46745] (other than amifampridine phosphate ) or an investigational medical 
device within 30 days before  Screening  
 
The following medicinal products should be use with caution in patients taking 
amifampridine phosphate:

10.6 Safety Variables  
Safety in this study will be determined from evaluation of AEs /SAEs , vital signs 
assessments, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, and physical examinations . Pregnancy 
testing is also required for females of ch ildbearing potential. The timing of the required 
evaluation s is described in the Schedule of Events in Table 3  and i n Section 13. 
10.6.1 Adverse Events  
The determination, evaluation and reporting of AEs will be performed as outlined in 
Section  11.  
10.6.2 Vital Signs  
Specific visits for obtaining vita l signs  are provided in  Table 3  and in Section 13. Vital signs 
will be measured while in a sitting position, after resting for 5 minutes, and include SBP and 
DBP measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), heart rate in beats per minute, respi[INVESTIGATOR_44454] . Weight (kg) and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)  will also be 
measured . Clinically signific ant changes from baseline will be recorded as AEs.

10.7 Efficacy Variable s 
The timing of required evaluation is described in the Schedule of Events in Table 3  according 
to the sequence listed below.  
Assessment  Start Time  
After Dose * 
(± 10 minutes unless 
otherwise specified)  
SGI [ADDRESS_46750], CGI-S and CGI-I At end of assessments  
  *Administration of medication represents Time 0 (minutes)  
If the stimulated single fiber EMG (optional assessment) is not to be performed, then the 
slurp test (also optional), CGI -S and CGI -I assessments should be done following completion 
of the MFM .   
10.7.[ADDRESS_46751]  Global  Impression  
The SGI (Farrar, 2001)  is a 7 -point scale on which the patient rates their global impression of 
the effects of a study treatment (1 = terrible to 7 = delighted).  The SGI will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_44508]’s  parent /guardian/ caregiver  if the patient  is unable to complete  the 
SGI. The SGI has demonstrated concordance with the physician’s assessment of 
improvement (Dodick, 2007) . Instructions for the SGI are provided in Appendix [ADDRESS_46752] MFM 32 (Bérard, 2005)  evaluates the severity and progression of motor 
function and is applicable to all degrees of disease severity, in both ambulant and 
nonambulant patients. It is not, however, well suited as an outcome measure in young 
children because of the time required to complete the MFM and difficulty in completion in 
terms of childrens’  cognitive and motor development. A short -form (MFM 20) (de Lattre, 
2013)  will be used in this study  for patients 2 years up to 7 years  of age , with each of 20 
items scored on a 4 -point Likert scale (based on patient’s best abilities without assistance): 
standing and transfers (8 items); axial and proximal motor function (8 items); and distal 
motor function (4 items). Total MFM 20 score ranges from 0 to 60. The MSM 32 will be 
used for patients 7 years  of age and older, with each of 32 items scored on a 4- point Likert 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 54  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
scale (based on patient’s best abilities without assistance) : standing and transfers (13  items), 
axial and proximal motor function (12 items), and distal motor function ( 7 items). Total 
MFM  32 score ranges from 0 to 96. Higher MFM 20 or 32 scores indicate more functional 
improvement. 
MFM 20  or 32 will be administered at the protocol specified time points by [CONTACT_44509]. Instructions  for conducting the MFM 20 and MFM  32 
are provided in Appendix  2 and Appendix  3, respectively, and in the CMS -001 Study 
Reference Manual.  
10.7.3 Clinical Global  Impression  Scales  
The CGI score is a 2 -part observer -rated instrument that assesses 1) severity of the patient’s 
disease (CGI -S) at a given point in time and 2) change from baseline (CGI -I). This 
instrument is widely used and well validated ( Busner, 2009) . The investigator will complete 
the 7 -point CGI -S based on his/her experience of severity in the C MS population as a whole 
as the point of reference. Instructions for the CGI -S are contained in Appendix 4 and the 
CMS-001 Study Reference Manual.  
The CGI -I captures the investigator’s global impression of the patient’s improvement or 
worsening from baseline status. The 7- point scale is scored by [CONTACT_44510], behavior, and functional abilities. Instructions for the CGI -I are 
contained in Appendix 5 and the C MS-001 Study Reference Manual.  
10.7.4 Stimulated Single  Fiber Electromyogram  
Stimulated s ingle  fiber EMG is a method to assess the integrity of the neuromuscular 
junction. The principal of stimulated  single fiber EMG is to measure the time variability of 
the muscle fiber action potentials as they are generated by [CONTACT_44511] 
(SFEMG using voluntary activation) versus the variability of a single muscle fiber potential 
(SFEMG us ing motor axonal stimulation). In infants, young children, or patients having 
difficulty in making a controlled activation, stimulated jitter analysis is preferable. From a 
technical standpoint, facial muscles such as the frontalis and orbicularis oculi are t he easiest 
to record by [CONTACT_44512]  a 
monopolar needle electrode. The latter has less associated stimulation artifact and better 
contr ol of the stimulating impulse. Since the recordings are made wit h a disposable 
concentric needle electrode, the term “jitter analysis” is preferred as being semantically more 
correct than single fiber EMG. Stimulated jitter analysis will be performed by a certified 
electromyographer. Local anesthetic agent will be appl ied to the site of needle electrode 
 CMS -[ADDRESS_46753]  
Patient’s with neuromuscular disorders experience increasing weakness of bulbar -innervated 
muscles that may result in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_44456]. The “ Slurp ” test is 
a non- invasive way of assess ing bulbar function (Hudspeth 2006) , particularly in children. 
Four ounces (120 mL) of water is placed in a cup. The patient  is instructed to drink the entire 
contents of the cup through a standard flex straw as quickly as possible, making a loud 
slurpi[INVESTIGATOR_44457]. The duration of time from the start of drinking the water to the 
slurp sound will be measured. This test i s optional . Slurp tests will be initiated during the up -
titration phase by [CONTACT_44513], thereafter 
only at identified places in the protocol timeline.   
[ADDRESS_46754] medical occurrence (e. g. sign, symptom, 
illness, disease or injury) in a patient administered the IP or other protocol -imposed 
intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes:  
• AEs not previously observed in the  patient that emerge during the course of the study.  
• Pre-existing me dical conditions judged by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator to have worsened in 
severity or frequency or changed in character during the study.  
• Complications that occur as a result of non -drug protocol -imposed interventions .  
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE.  
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis.  
The study  period during which all non- serious AEs will be reported begins after informed 
consent is obtained and the  first administration of study drug through the last visit ( Study 
Day 29) or at the early termination visit. After informed consent but prior to initiation of 
study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol -imposed interventions will be 
reported. The criteria for determining, and the reporting of SAEs is provided in Section 11.2. 
 CMS -[ADDRESS_46755] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or 
partici pation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be 
documented on the appropriate CRF page(s) and in the patient’s medical record.  
The i nvestigator responsible for the care of the patient or qualified designee will assess AEs 
for se verity, relationship to IP, and seriousness ( refer to  Section 11.2 for SAE definition). 
Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not eq uivalent to seriousness, which is 
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligat ions.  
The i nvestigator  will determine the severity of each AE using the following Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v 4 grades defined in  Table 7  (the event 
will be recorded on the source documents and AE CRF)  (Appendix 5) . Events that are 
CTCAE grades [ADDRESS_46756] a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed 
according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below.  
Table 7. Categories of Severity for CTCAE Criteria  
Severity  Description  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms;  clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening;

limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.  Note: Grade 4 and 5 
adverse events should 
always be reported as 
serious adverse events  Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)

managing money, etc.  
** Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.

11.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria : 
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
• Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the patient at immediate risk 
of death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death

• Requires or prolongs in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, that is, an AE that occurs in the child or fetus 
of a patient  exposed to IP prior to conception or during pregnancy  
• Is an important medical event  or reaction .  
For this study, a generalized tonic- clonic convulsion/seizure is  to be considered an  SAE . 
The reporting period for SAE s begins after informed consent is obta ined and continues 
through [ADDRESS_46758] be reported within 24 hours 
of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_44517] (fax, email)  the study -specifi c SAE Report Form to 
Catalyst.  As additional information becomes available, including but not limited to the 
outcome of the SAE and any medication or other therapeutic measures used to treat the 
event, it must be reported within [ADDRESS_46759] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be 
documented in the eCRF  and in the patient’s medical record.  
For some SAEs, Catalyst  may follow  up by [CONTACT_756], fax, e mail, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report 
(e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, autopsy report).  
At the last scheduled visit, the i nvestigator should instruct each patient to report any 
subsequent SAEs that the patient’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior 
study treatment.  
The i nvestigator should notify Catalyst  of any death or SAE occurring at any time after a 
patient has discontinued, or terminated study participation, if felt to be related to prior study 
treatment. Catalyst  should also be notified if the i nvest igator should become aware of the 
development of cancer, or of a congenital anomaly, in a subsequently conceived offspring of 
a patient that participated in this study.   
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB , IEC  or REB will be done in compliance with the standard 
operating procedures and policies of the IRB , IEC  or REB and with applicable regulatory 
requirements. Adequate documentation must be provided showing that the IRB  IEC or REB 
was properly and promptly notified as required.

notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) 
Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the 
occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the 
investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the 
subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to 
protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the 
IRB/EC/REB  is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for urgent s afety measures is 
the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit. 
Investigators are required to report any urgent safety measures with in 24 hours.

Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures  include discovery of the 
following:  
• An immediate need to revise IP administration (i. e. modified dose amount or 
frequency not defined in protocol).  
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management.  
• Discovery that the quality or s afety of IP does not meet established safety

15 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF  SAMPLE SIZE 
15.1 Determi nation of Sample Size  
Assuming a standardized between -treatment difference of 0.5, 23 patients per sequence will 
ensure power of 90% for the 2- sided test at the 0.[ADDRESS_46773] 2- by-2 crossover 
analysis.  
15.2 Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population (i.e. all patients who receive at 
least 1  dose of amifampridine phosphate or placebo). The safety analysis will be descriptive 
and will be presented on observed data only. All safety data, and corresponding Change 
From  Baseline (CFB) if appropriate, will be listed.  
15.3 Adverse Events  
All treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_44521]. Counts and percentages will be presented by [CONTACT_44522] s (SOC) and preferred term (PT) as defined in MedDRA. Summaries by 
[CONTACT_44523]. Listings of all deaths, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AE will be provided. 
15.4 Laboratory Tests  
For each laboratory parameter, descriptive statistics will be presented for the observed value 
and CFB by [CONTACT_44524]. The frequency and percentage of 
patients who experience abnormal (i.e. outside of reference rang es) laboratory values will be 
presented by [CONTACT_44524]. Clinically significant abnormalities will 
be collected as AEs.  
15.5 Other Safety Assessments  
Summary statistics for vital signs, physical examinations, and ECG parameters will b e 
presented by [CONTACT_44524].  
15.6 Efficacy Analysis  
The following provides a summary of the planned statistical analyses. Details will be 
provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to 
unblinding. Any inconsistency between the SAP and the protocol will be noted in the SAP.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed for 2 datasets:  
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 69  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
Full Analysis Set (FAS): This population consists of all randomized patients who receive at 
least 1 dose of IP (amifampri dine phosphate or placebo) and have at least one post -treatment 
efficacy assessment.  
Per Protocol (PP): This population is a subset of the FAS population, excluding patients with 
major protocol deviations. 
If the PP Population is the same as the FAS, then the results will be presented only for the 
FAS. Exclusion from the FAS and PP Population will be finalized prior to database lock and 
subsequent unblinding.  
In addition to the following, summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_44525]-I, CGI -S, Change From Baseline (CFB) for CGI -S, the optional Slurp Test, and 
variables associated with the optional SFEMG.  
15.[ADDRESS_46774] analys is for a 2 -by-2 crossover design. Summary statistics for SGI and CFB for SGI 
will be presented by [CONTACT_44479]. P -values <0.05 wil be considered statistically 
significant.  
15.8 Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The total score for MFM and the subtotal for eac h of the three dimensions (Standing and 
transfer, Axial and proximal motor function, and Distal motor function) will be standardized 
by [CONTACT_44480] [ADDRESS_46775] analysis for a 2 -by-2 crossover design for 
MFM  20 and MFM  32 separately and pooled, with the latter being the secondary and the 
separate analyses being supportive. The total scores, subtotals for each dimension, and the 
corresponding standardized scores  will be summarized by [CONTACT_44481] 20 
and MFM 32 separately and standardized scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_44526] 20 and MFM 32 pooled. P -values <0.[ADDRESS_46776] , who will then issue a formal protocol amendment to 
implement the change. The only exception is when an investigator cons iders that a patient’s 
safety is compromised without immediate action. In these circumstances, immediate approval 
of the chairman of the IRB/IEC/REB must be sought, and the investigator should inform 
Catalyst  and the full IRB/IEC/REB within [ADDRESS_46777]  will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study  (as included in the site budget) . In 
addition, after IRB/IEC/REB approval, Catalyst  may reimburse the cost of travel for study -
related visits. Catalyst  will not pay for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, or treatments for medical 
problems of any sort, whether or not related to the study patient ’s disease that  are not part of 
this study. Costs associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments should be billed and 
collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected.  
The investigator should contact [CONTACT_44527] a study patient 
has been injured by [CONTACT_44528]. Any patient who 
experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_44529] a pre- specified medical i nstitution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The patient should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_44530], and assistance with, treatment for study -related injuries. The 
treating physic ian should bill the patient’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the patient has followed the investigator’s 
instructions, Catalyst  will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the 
injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531], if these costs are not covered by [CONTACT_44532]. In some jurisdictions, Catalyst  
is obligated by [CONTACT_44533] -related injuries without prior recourse to third party 
payer billing. If this is the case, Catalyst  will comply with the law.  
17 CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
The CRO data management department or designees will perform all data management 
activities, including the writing of a data management plan outlining the systems and 
procedures to be used.  
Study data on will be cap tured on CRFs and will be verified to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and patient records. 
In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Patients must also allow access to 
their medical records, and patients will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement 
when giving informed consent. The investigator must review and sign the completed CRF 
casebook to verify its accuracy.

Appendix  2 Motor Function Measure (MFM 32 or 20)  
The MFM 32 will be used to evaluate the s everity and progression of motor function in 
patients 7 years of age and older. For patients 2 years up to 6 years of age, t he MFM 20 will 
be used to evaluate the severity and progression of motor function .   The MFM 32 or 20 
(depending on age) will be administered at the protocol specified time points (see Table 3 ) by 
[CONTACT_44539] .  
Each of the  32 items listed below will be graded using a 4 -point Likert scale based on the 
patient’s best abilities without any assistance:  
0 Cannot initiate the task  
1 Partially performs the task  
2 Performs the movement incompletely, or completely  but imperfectly (comp ensatory 
movements, position maintained for an insufficient duration of time, slowness,        
uncontrolled movement)  
3 Performs the task fully and “normally”; the movement is controlled, mastered, 
directed, and performed at constant speed  
 
The 20 motor function measures comprising the MFM20 are marked with   (child <7 years 
old) 
Total score ranges from 0 to 96 when summing the 32 items and from 0 to 60 when summing 
the 20 items.

Assuming a standardized between- treatment difference of 0.5, 23 patients per sequence 
will ensure power of 90% for the [ADDRESS_46815] 2 -by-2 
crossover analysis.  
15.2 Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population (i.e. all patients who receive 
at least 1  dose of amifampridine phosphate or placebo). The safety analysis will be 
descriptive and will be presented on observed data only. All safety data, and 
corresponding Change From Baseline (CFB) if appropriate, will be listed.  
15.3 Adverse Events  
All treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_44546]. Counts and percentages will be presented by [CONTACT_44547] -001

due to AE will be provided.  
15.4 Laboratory Tests  
For each laboratory parameter, descriptive statistics will  be presented for the observed 
value and CFB by [CONTACT_44524]. The frequency and 
percentage of patients who experience abnormal (i.e. outside of reference ranges) 
laboratory values will be presented by [CONTACT_44524]. 
Clinically significant abnormalities will be collected as AEs.  
15.5 Other Safety Assessments  
Summary statistics for vital signs, physical examinations, and ECG parameters will be 
presented by [CONTACT_44524].  
15.6 Efficacy Analysis  
The following provides a summary of the planned statistical analyses. Details will be 
provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to 
unblinding. Any inconsistency between the SAP and the protocol will be noted in the 
SAP.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed for 2 datasets:  
Full Analysis Set (FAS): This population consists of all randomized patients who 
receive at least 1 dose of IP (amifampridine phosphate or placebo) and have at least one 
post-treatment efficacy assessment.  
Per Protocol (PP): This population is a subset of the FAS population, excluding patients 
with major protocol deviations.  
If the PP Population is the same as the FAS, then the results will be presented only for 
the FAS. Exclusio n from the FAS and PP Population will be finalized prior to database 
lock and subsequent unblinding.  
In addition to the following, summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_44549] -I, CGI -S, Change From Baseline (CFB) for CGI -S, the optio nal Slurp 
Test, and variables associated with the optional SFEMG.

and CFB for SGI will be presented by [CONTACT_44479]. P -values <0.05 wil be 
considered statistically significant.  
15.8 Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The total score for MFM and the subtotal for each of the three dimensions (Standing 
and transf er, Axial and proximal motor function, and Distal motor function) will be 
standardized by [CONTACT_44480] [ADDRESS_46817] analysis for a 2 -by-2 
crossover design for MFM  20 and MFM  32 separately and pooled, with the latter being 
the secondary and the separate analyses being supportive. The total scores, subtotals for 
each dimension, and the corresponding standardized scores will be summarized by

Appendix 9: Protocol Amendment  4 
PURPOSE:  The purpose of this amendment is as follows:  
To formally remove the videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_44471], clarify the start and stop 
times of Periods 1 and 2, blinded medication dosing, and remove the Day 36 visit.  The 
patient is either on a stable dose of amifampridine phosphate or has been titrated over a 
period of 4 weeks. Also, the patient is observed on open label medication for 2 weeks during 
the restabilization period.  Therefore, the Day 36 visit on open label medication adds no new 
information to  the efficacy or safety profile of amifampridine phosphate and the patient may 
go directly into the expanded access program.  
Risk : these administrative changes provide clarity, adding no additional risk to the patient.

Appendix 10: Protocol Amendment  5 
PURPOSE:  The purpose of this amendment is as follows:  
To formally remove the videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_44471], clarify the start and stop 
times of Periods 1 and 2, blinded medication dosing, and remove the Day 36 visit.  The 
patient is either on a stable dose of amifampridine phosphate or has been titrated over a 
period of 4 weeks. Also, the patient is observed on open label medication for 2 weeks du ring 
the restabilization period.  Therefore, the Day 36 visit on open label medication adds no new 
information to the efficacy or safety profile of amifampridine phosphate and the patient may 
go directly into the expanded access program.  
Risk : these administrative changes provide clarity, adding no additional risk to the patient.

On Page 32, under 8.4.4 Safety of Amifampridine and Amifampridine Phosphate , added text  
Based upon the previous clinical studies involving the use of amifampridine in the 
treatment of Lambert -Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), there have been reports of 
provocation of bronchial asthma, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], or respi[INVESTIGATOR_44447].  These events 
are also part of CMS symptoms; however, the risk may be more likely when the patient has 
asthm a or respi[INVESTIGATOR_44448] a comorbidity with CMS.

1. Patients entering the study may already be on some formulation of 3,4- diaminopyridine 
and have demonstrated tolerability or;  
2. Patients naïve to the medication are titrated to a tolerable and effective dose with open -
label medication, under the observation of the Investigator.  Thus, the development of 
adverse events or lack of efficacy is monitored by [CONTACT_44555] -wise

titration and study medication dose can be reduced or discontinued at any point in the 
titration for either safety or lack of efficacy.   
The pharmacokinetic half -life of amifampridine phosphate is short (1.8 hours), therefore 
discontinuation of medication will qickly terminate the effects, and mitigate adverse 
reactions.  
This is a withdrawal study design looking at patient worsening on placebo; which is 
possible due to the short half -life o f amifampridine phosphate. Therefore, patients must 
demonstrate a level of efficacy during the open -label titration period.  This further reduces 
patient risk, by [CONTACT_44556] a benefit.  
During the placebo withdrawal period, patients who deteriorate to a point that the 
Investigator assess to be lower than their baseline, open -label amifampridine phosphate is 
provided as to rescue the patient.  
Refer to the Firdapse Investigator Brochure (Febr uary, 2015) for further discussion 
information  on benefit/risk of amifampridine.

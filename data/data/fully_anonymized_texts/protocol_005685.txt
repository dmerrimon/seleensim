Study Title  Community Health Outreach to Increase Cervical Cancer Education and Self -
Collection Screening (CHOICESS) Program for Southeast Asian Immigrant and 
Refugee Women in Wisconsin 
Brief Summary  The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether educational workshops 
paired with self -collected high- risk human papi[INVESTIGATOR_190507] (hrHPV) screening will 
increase participation in cervical cancer screening among Southeast Asian refugee 
and immigrant populations  in Wisconsin compared with offering clinician- collected 
screening (total sample size: 250 participants) . We hypothesize that participation in 
cervical cancer screening will be higher among women in the intervention group as 
compared to the control group.

Secondary 
Objective(s)  To evaluate participant satisfaction with the educational workshops using satisfaction 
surveys.  
Research 
Intervention(s)  Control  workshops are workshops where participants are provided education on 
standard -of-care for cervical cancer screening such as pap smear and HPV testing 
through clinician- collection methods using speculum and cervical swabs. 
Intervention  workshops are workshops where participants are provided all the same 
education as control as well as additional education on self -collection for HPV -only 
testing using vaginal swab as an additional method.   
After each workshop, each group will be offered to participate in their assigned 
group’s screening method (clinician -collected or self -collected).

health disparities.1 Factors such as modesty, fatalism, lack of knowledge, and lack of access impede 
participation in screening and treatment for cervical cancer. These barriers can be attributed to cultural beliefs, patriarchal family/clan structure, language barriers, and m istrust or lac k of experience in the Western medical 
system.

In women 25 and over, screening for cervical cancer screening through testing for high -risk human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_190507] (hrHPV) has been found to be more sensitive than cytology  and effective in preventing 
cervical cancer .[ADDRESS_1227260] a 
doubled  response rate to submitting a self -sample versu s scheduling an on -site pap smear, even among 
under -screened populations .8-10 Furthermore, with improved hrHPV polymerase chain reaction ( PCR )-based 
testing technology, the sensitivity for detection of human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) infections is comparable in most 
self-collect samples when compared to clinician- collected samples. Kaiser Permanente ran a similar study 
across 20,000 women who were behind on their screening and found that 50% more women chose to return a self-sample than schedule an in- office scr een. A large population- based cervical cancer self -collected study in 
Argentina found that HPV -based screening doubles the detection rate ratio (DRR) for HPV screening.
[ADDRESS_1227261] led some countries, such as Australia, to institute a self -collection option nationally .8,10 
Furthermore, our previous work in rural Zimbabwe found that community -based screening using self -collected 
samples increased participation in cervical cancer screening from a baseline of 5% to 82% participation.11-[ADDRESS_1227262] Asian refugee and immigrant 
populations to improve cervical cancer screening participation has not been investigated. The Milwaukee 
Consortium for Hmong Health (MCHH), supported by  [CONTACT_878492], has had success increasing 
participation in breast cancer screening through outreach and education activities . How ever, it continues to 
have limited success engaging women in cervical cancer screening. We have established a partner ship with 
MCHH to develop innovative cervical cancer workshops that combine community health worker  (CHW) -led 
engagement with self -collected hrHPV screening, with the primary objective of increasing participation, 
awareness, and engagement in cervical cancer screening and treatment activities among this population.

Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
• To evaluate whether educational 
workshops paired with self -collected 
hrHPV  screening will increase 
participation in cervical cancer 
screening among Southeast Asian (  
Hmong, Burmese, Karen,  and 
Karenni ) refugee and immigrant 
populations in Wisconsin compared 
with offering clinician -collected 
screening.  • Uptake of cervical cancer screening using a 
self-collect device vs. clinician -based 
screening.  
Secondary  
• To evaluate participant satisfaction 
with the educational workshops using 
satisfaction surveys.  • Participant satisfaction as determined using 
qualitative methods.  
 
• To evaluate participant willingness to 
use self -collection as method for 
screening.  • General willingness to use a  HPV self -collect 
device at home and/or as the preferred collection method for cervical cancer 
screening,  assessed via mixed methods 
survey.  
 
3. STUDY PARTICIPANTS  
 
Study participants in this project include participants recruited for cervical cancer CHW- led educational 
workshops led by [CONTACT_878493]. Participants can be either Hmong, Karen, Burmese or Karenni speaking and are 
recruited by [CONTACT_878494] a particular focus on those who are behind or have never had cervical cancer screening. The main objective is to provide education to these participants on cervical cancer prevention and 
screening with subsequent invitation for immediate post- workshop sample collection for cervical cancer 
screening.  
 4. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS  
 Total number of study subjects: 250.  
 5. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
 5.1 Inclusion Criteria  
• Female (assigned female at birth, regardless of gender identity)  
• Ages 25- 65 
• Fluent understanding in English, Karen, Burmese, Hmong or Karenni.  
5.2 Exclusion Criteria  
• Prior hysterectomy  
• Impaired decision- making capacity  
• Pregnancy  
 
6. SPECIAL POPULATIONS  
 
Those who lack consent capacity, the mentally ill, prisoners, cognitively impaired persons, children, and 
employees will not be included in this research study.

Page 8 of 32 confidential  version #3 .0 – 03/17/[ADDRESS_1227263] the study team via other 
recruitment methods, will include a brief description of the study’s purpose, eligibility criteria, and participant 
involvement will be reviewed. This must also include a statement that participation is voluntary. The screener 
will ask the caller if she has any questions and whether they are interested in participating. After all questions have been answered, the study team member will ask if the potential subject is interested in proceeding to the 
next step in recruitment for the study. Potential subjects will answer pre- screening questions using an IRB -
approved script. Information collected from potential subjects who fail pre- screening will be destroyed at the 
end of the study period.  Potential subjects who meet all pre -screening criteria will be invited to a particular 
workshop day in order to go through the consent process.

8. CONSENT  PROCESS 
 
The informed consent process will make clear that participation in any and all aspects of the study are 
voluntary, and that participants may end their participation at any time.  
 The informed consent process will be conducted following all federal and institutional regulations relating to 
informed consent. Informed consent will be obtained at the beginning of participation through  the following 
process:  
- A link to a pre -record video will be provided to each participant at the time of recruitment. This video will 
be created prior to the start of the study  which CHWs employed through MCHH  will provide consent 
information using the pre -approved oral script .  
o If the CH W does not speak the spoken language, then an the CHW would follow the script in 
English and a translator would then translate the information to the participant language.  
- Upon arrival to the study, participants will be asked if they have seen the pre- recorded video:  
o If any participant reports the video was not viewed – it will be shown to all participants.  
o CHW provides  a summary about the study, study activity, and cons ent items, then answering 
any questions which may arise.  
Cervical Cancer Self -Collection for Hmong and Karenni Women   UW HS- IRB 2021- 1525  
Page 9 of 32 confidential  version #3 .0 – 03/17/23   If the CHW does not speak the spoken language, then an the CHW would provide the 
information in English and a translator would then translate the information to the 
participant language. Questions or comments will also be translated back to the CHW to 
be ans wered. The translator  will serve as witness to ensure  that study mater ials and 
consent were understood by [CONTACT_2299].  
- It will be noted in a participant’s study record noting they provided verbal consent.  
 
.  
 Participants will be informed of random assignment into two groups: standard- of-care control group and 
intervention group. Due to the nature of this study, we will not disclose which group the participant belongs to 
although will provide a debrief session at the end of the study about what information could not be given at the 
time of consenting, and why they could not be told at that time.  
 Participants will not be told the full procedures prior to enrollment due to the need to test the hypothesis in this 
study. Participants in the control group are initially only provided educational materials about the standard of 
care for cervical cancer s creening. While self -collection may or may not be known by [CONTACT_878495], this is not standard of practice nor usually recommended by [CONTACT_15098]. Whereas the 
intervention group is provided additional materials about self -collection  in the core educational material and is 
offered as a screening option immediately at the end of the workshop . The uptake of cervical cancer screening 
by [CONTACT_878496].  
 
The informed consent process will include contact [CONTACT_71722], who can be contact[CONTACT_878497]. . Informed consent forms will be available in written 
English, Hmong, or Karenni for reference only . All participants will have access to the pre- recorded video in 
their native language for reference.  
 
9. PROCESS TO DOCUMENT CONSENT IN WRITING  
 
This study r equest s of waiver of written document ation of  consent   
- A written  script of the information will be provided orally.  
- Pre-recorded video of oral script will be available to all participants for future reference.  
- Research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects.  
- The research  involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research  
context.  
 
This consent requests an alteration of the consent process (HRP -410) due to the following criteria:  
- The study involves no more than Minimal Risk  to the participants based on clinical standard of care.  
- The study could not be practically carried out without the alteration. Participants will be blinded to which 
group they are randomized in order measure participation rates based on which type of screening 
method they are offered (clinician- collection vs se lf-collection)  
- The alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects. Participants will be provided the risks of each collection method in detail during the workshops. If a participant declines the 
type of screening they are offered will then be  offered the other screening method.  
- Subjects will be provided the additional pertinent information after participation.  
- High proportion of participants in this study population have no or low reading or writing literacy in English or the native language.  
 10. SETTING  
 
The location where the research team will conduct the research will be at MCHH’s community center ([ADDRESS_1227266], Milwaukee WI [ZIP_CODE]) . The space has been previously used by [CONTACT_878498] -Collection for Hmong and Karenni Women   UW HS- IRB 2021- 1525  
Page 10 of 32 confidential  version #3 .0 – 03/17/[ADDRESS_1227267] Asian immigrant and refugee populations.  
 All workshops will be conducted by [CONTACT_878499]. If the CHW is not fluent in the target 
language (such as Karen or Burmese), then the CHW will conduct all study activities in English with a translator available to translate all activities.  
 
All participants attending a workshop will be randomized as a group to either a control or intervention group. 
Workshops in the control group will provide education recommending standard of care (clinician- collected 
hrHPV testing and cytology screening). W orkshops in the intervention group will be offered the same education 
with additional education on the option of self -collection (HPV testing only) for their screening method. All 
participants will have the same basic demographic information collected in M CHH’s standard intake form with 
an additional question on current barriers to screening.  
 
Participants will self -select which workshop day they would like to attend depending on their preferred 
language. Participants can attend any available date a workshop is being offered until filled. Participants will be 
blinded to knowing which workshops are control or intervention groups. Participants during consent will be 
made aware there are two different groups and the difference between the intervention and control group is the 
education provided and screening method offered at the end of the education session. Participants will be 
provided the full study details at the end of their participation.  
 
We anticipate a total of thirty workshops, fifteen  of which will be control and fifteen of which will be intervention, 
will be planned in total over a sixteen -month period (Table 1). All workshops will have 8 participants recruited 
due to limited space of the community center, time, and to accommodate physical spacing needs. There will be 
two workshop sessions per day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).

After workshop conclusion, participants will be offered same- day on -site cervical cancer screening depending 
on assignment in the control or intervention group (clinician- collected screening or self -collection screening, 
respectively). Participants, regardless of engagement in screening, will then complete a post -evaluation 
workshop survey (consisting of two surveys, see Appendix C).  
 Due to ethical concerns and our hypothesis that this population is less likely to do cervical cancer screening if 
offered clinician- collected screening only. Participants in the control workshops who answer “yes” on the 
survey to the question “If given the  option, instead of having a clinician collect the sample, would you want to 
collect the sample on your own?,” will be subsequently offered self- collection for their screening method. 
CHWs will provide to these participants a 5- minute 1- on-[ADDRESS_1227268] -workshop screening is outlined in Figure 1.

and follow up call from CHWs on results of screening tests (if indicated) .  
- Duration of participation involvement is estimated to be between two to three hours . 
- Activities involved is primarily attendance at a  45-minute workshop  followed by [CONTACT_447] -workshop survey 
(estimate to complete in three - to five -minutes)  
- Participants who opt for screening for cervical cancer after workshop completion will spend an 
additional [ADDRESS_1227270] ed by [CONTACT_878500] . 
Those with positive results will be asked to return to the community center to discuss the results in-
person with CHWs, with a clinician available by [CONTACT_878501].  
 Anticipated duration to enroll all study participants will be over 16 months. Estimated date for researchers to 
complete this study (including primary analysis) is over 24 months starting from IRB approval.

for this research program. [CONTACT_878525] (MCHH Director) will maintain original intake forms at the MCHH 
community center and  participant identities to the study ID  separately from other data.  Following information 
from the intake form will be collected for this research program : 
• ID Number  
• First and last initials  
• Workshop Date  
• Ethnicity  
• Date of Birth  
• Gender  
• Month and year of previous Pap Test

[ ] Childcare  
[ ] No family history of cervical cancer  
[ ] My doctor never mentioned it  
[ ] Embarrassed  
[ ] Long wait to get an appointment  
[ ] None  
  
If a participant has a PCP , MCHH can fax or mail the results of their screening tests directly to their PCP . For 
participants who do not have a PCP and would like to establish with  one, a list of available providers in the 
area accepting new patients will be obtained prior to the start of the research study.  
 
Providers accepting new patients will be oriented by [CONTACT_32216] a research team member prior to the start of the 
study. They will be provided with a brief overview of the research study and purpose. In addition, when 
receiving participant results on cervical  cancer screening, cover letter will include a brief overview of the 
research project, purpose, recommend follow -up, and need for patient to establish as a new patient to their 
clinic.

13.1.[ADDRESS_1227277] -Workshop Sample Collection  
 
Immediately after workshops, participants will be offered same- day opportunity to engage in cervical cancer 
screening either through clinician collection (if in the control) or self -collection (if in the intervention group). 
Participants who do not desire screening through the program will be encouraged to attend cervical cancer 
screening with their local health department or provider.  
 
Pregnant women will be excluded from this study  if they are known to be pregnant at the time of screening, 
although additional measures will be taken prior to sample collection for women unaware of pregnancy status . 
All participants will be asked the date of their last menstrual period (LMP). Participants will be requested to 
provide a urine sample for on -site urine pregnancy testing if more than six weeks from LMP unless post -
menopausal or meeting criteria of relative certainty a woman is not pregnant. CDC 2016 Selective Practice 
Recommendations for reasonable certainty states, a health care provider can be reasonably certain that 
women is not pregnant if she has no symptoms or signs of pregnancy and meets any one of the following 
criteria:  
- is ≤[ADDRESS_1227278] normal menses  
- has been correctly and consistently using a reliable method of contraception 
- is ≤7 days after spontaneous or induced abortion  
- is within 4 weeks postpartum  
- is fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), amenorrheic, and <[ADDRESS_1227279] will be provided immediately to the participant and if positive, excluded 
from the remaining of the study although still counted as a participant. Due the possibility that participants who 
are pregnant and included in the study (educational workshops only, will not be included in either screening 
method–  clinician -collected or self -collection). For risks involved with the educational workshop portion of the 
study:  
- The research involves no more than minimal risk to pregnant women and fetuses.  
- The research holds prospect of direct benefit to the pregnant women, the prospect of direct benefit both 
to the pregnant woman and the fetus, or no prospect of benefit for the woman nor the fetus.  
- The educational workshops on cervical cancer provided potential benefit by [CONTACT_878506].  
 
Physicians from UW - Madison will be made available to assist in either group with CHWs as approved 
translators to guide collection.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Self-Swab Vaginal Samples  
Participants will be provided a private area of their choice (exam room or bathroom) to self -
collect vaginal samples. Device which will be used is the Evalyn
® Brush (Rovers Medical 
Devices, Netherlands) which has FDA and CLIA approval. The device is self -directed by [CONTACT_878507] , Karen, and Burmese  and 
Karenni . Instructions will also be provided to all participants orally.  The device is neither 
implanted nor creates a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the 
subject. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_878485] -collected provided by [CONTACT_878508] B. There are no known potential serious risks to the

The provider ([CONTACT_878526]) will obtain a sample in the normal standard fashion using 
speculum to collect cervical samples. Samples will be collected in ThinPrep vials for Pap 
smear and HPV testing.  
 
Self-collected samples  will be packaged for disposition and transported to the Penn State Health Medical 
Group Laboratory for processing and evaluation. C linician -collected samples will be packaged for disposition 
and transport to the WSLH lab for processing and evaluation. There are no known potential serious risks to the 
health, safety, or welfare of the subject.  
 If participants have a primary care provider and did not sign a ROI form at intake and at this time would like 
their results sent to their provider, a ROI form will be offered to be filled out and signed.  
 
13.1.5  Sample handling and analysis  
 Clinic ian-collected samples will be labeled with study ID, participant  initials, date of collection and source of 
collection (cervix)  and transported via approved courier to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene ( WSLH).  
 
Self-collected samples collected using the Evalyn self -collection device will be transferred to a ThinPrep vial for 
storage and transport. The vial will be labeled with study ID, participant initials,  date of collection  and source  of 
collection (vaginal self) and transported via approved courier to the Penn State Health Medical Group 
Laboratory.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  HPV testing  
All samples will be processed at the WSLH  (if cervical clinician -collected)  or Penn State Health Medical Group 
Laboratory  (if vaginal self -collected)  and tested for the presence of 14  oncogenic/high- risk HPV genotypes 16, 
18, and other (31,33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58,59,66,68) using the CLIA -certified [COMPANY_002] Cobas4800 HPV Test 
System ([COMPANY_002]  Molecular Systems Inc., Rotkreuz, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Negative samples with the process control (β -globin) DNA concentration that does not fall within [COMPANY_002]'s pre-
determined range will be considered technically inadequate.  
 
Samples will be pre -aliquoted into properly barcoded 13ml round bottomed sarstedt tubes (2ml) for HPV 
primary testing according to the [COMPANY_002] Cobas HPV Test package insert. All samples will be run on the [COMPANY_002] Cobas 4800 (for a full HPV workflow following t he package insert guidelines). Unsatisfactory results will be run 
a second time per laboratory  standard operating procedure. Results of the sample will be reported to MCHH 
using standard operating and HIPAA procedures. All HPV Test run results will be anal yzed and checked for 
quality by [CONTACT_878509].  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Pap Smear testing  
Cytological studies, including cell counts, will be performed on the remaining material in the ThinPrep vials 
following WSLH standard operating procedure, summarized as follows. M ono-layer smears will be generated 
on the  CLIA -certified  Hologic T -[ADDRESS_1227280] with five years or more of experience in GYN cytology. Abnormal 
slides will be reviewed by [CONTACT_878510]. Unsatisfactory study samples will be reprocessed at the discretion 
of the WSLH Cytology Director. All cytology samples will be assessed for 1) adequacy (>5,000  cells per slide, 
estimated based on ten fields counted at 400x magnification) and, 2) diagnoses according to Bethesda 
System. Clinician -collected cytology cases will be evaluated as part of the routine clinical flow and results 
reported to MCHH. Cytologic al results will be grouped as the diagnosis of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_878486] (ASC -US+) and as high- grade dysplasia (HG cytology). Histological 
results will be grouped as the diagnosis of cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] 2 or higher (CIN2+), cervical 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] 3 or higher (CIN3+), and cervical carcinoma (CA).

results  will be asked to return to the community center to discuss the results in- person with MCHH CHWs with 
a clinician from the study team available virtually to answer any questions. Two attempts will be made to call 
the participant via phone and if still not reached, a letter will be mailed to the participant’s home.   
 
All participants regardless of results will be provided a printed copy of their results via mail  or in-person. If a 
participant  does not have a preferred primary care clinic, additional resources will be given on available 
providers in the area accepting new patients . If participants filled out an ROI form at intake, all results as well 
as brief letter describing the study will be faxed or mailed to the health care clinic. Guidelines for appropriate 
follow up by [CONTACT_878514]  (ASCCP ) standards are outlined through an online 
web application, mobile app, and website (asccp.org/management -guidelines). These management guidelines 
will be followed for interpreting risk of pathology and recommendation of follow up needs.  
 
14. COMPARISON OF USUAL CARE AND STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
Standard of care for women recommended by [CONTACT_878515] 21 
with pap smear every three years and then co- testing (HPV and pap smear) starting at age 30. American 
Cancer Society (ACS) recommends screening starting at age [ADDRESS_1227282] of care as expected for care delivered to participant population at 
UW-Madison/UW Health , regarding clinician collection of samples for cervical cancer screening. In both the 
intervention and control arms of the study, participants will be offered the opportunity for cervical cancer 
screening via a licensed health care professional . The intervention is education and use of self -collection for 
HPV only testing using vaginal swab as an additional method to usual care,  i.e., pap smear and HPV testing 
through clinician- collection methods using speculum and cervical swabs (control).   
 Overall, research has shown self -collection HPV testing as an acceptable method for screening especially in 
hard- to-reach populations, although concerns remain on potential for false negative results.

20. STUDY ANALYSIS  
 
20.1 Statistical Hypothesis  
 
Participation in cervical cancer screening will be higher among women in the intervention group as compared 
to the control group.  
Cervical Cancer Self -Collection for Hmong and Karenni Women   UW HS- IRB 2021- 1525  
Page 22 of 32 confidential  version #3 .0 – 03/17/23   
20.2 Sample Size Justification 
 For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will enroll 250 participants, which is based on the feasibility of the number of workshops 
possible during the program length, funding, and resources available through MCHH.
9 Power estimates are 
based on comparing the rate of participation between the intervention arm (participants offered self -collected 
hrHPV)  and the control arm (participants offered clinician- collected screening). Estimates of screening rates for 
the Hmong women population (percent that have had a clinician- collected screening in the last 2 -3 years) 
range from 61 - 81%. As we do not have estimates for rates for Karenni , Karen, Bur mese, or Hmong women , 
we will use these estimates for participation rates in the control arm . The table below shows the detectable 
participation rates (and differences between proportions) for the intervention arm for different combinations of 
power (1 -β) and values for the control arm from 0.61- 0.81, for the hypotheses H0: P ≤ p 0 vs. H1: P > p 0, where 
p0 is the rate of participation in the control arm, for a sample size of 250 (125/arm), with a one -sided level 0.[ADDRESS_1227287].  
 
Detectable Participation Rate (Difference)  
Control 
Participation Rate  Power  
0.80 0.85 0.90 
0.61 0.77 (0.16)  0.78 (0.17)  0.79 (0.18)  
0.71 0.85 (0.14)  0.86 (0.15)  0.87 (0.16)  
0.81 0.93 (0.12)  0.93 (0.12)  0.94 (0.13)  
 
As an example, if there is a participation rate of 0.[ADDRESS_1227288] a rate of 0.93 (a difference of 0.12) in the participants offered self -collected hrHPV  with a one -
sided level 0.[ADDRESS_1227289] with a power of 0.85.  
 
20.3 Statistical Methods  
 20.3.1  Primary Outcome Measures and Analysis:  
 
The primary outcome measure is uptake of cervical cancer screening.  The results will be reported through 
summary statistics of the number of participants in each group subsequently engaging or seeking out cervical cancer screening either through services offered after workshop education or self -reported desire to follow up 
through their community health care provider. Comparisons between the study arms will be based on a 
binomial test. The analysis will indicate if participants offered additional self -collection education would be more 
willing to engage in cervical cancer screening. Summary statistics will also include uptake of screening 
differentiated by [CONTACT_878518].  
 
20.3.[ADDRESS_1227290] of the 
educational workshops.  
 
Further statistical support for this program will be obtained through consultation with statisticians in the UW -
Madison SMPH and/or UW Carbone Cancer Center Biostatistics Shared Resource. For quantitative data, 
differences will be tested with Wilcoxon Rank -Sum tests for continuous or ordinal categorical data, Chi -
Squared tests for unordered categorical data, and binomial tests for dichotomous data.  
 
21. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS 
 Potential benefits of the study are linked to the goal of the project –  providing access to an alternative method 
for cervical cancer screening through self -collection for HPV testing. In addition, all participants will benefit by 
[CONTACT_878519], led,  and sponsored by  a trusted 
community organization. This  research has the potential to reduce barriers to screening for vulnerable 
Cervical Cancer Self -Collection for Hmong and Karenni Women   UW HS- IRB 2021- 1525  
Page 23 of 32 confidential  version #3 .0 – 03/17/[ADDRESS_1227291] a minimal risk to participants. Potential risks of the  both collection methods 
(clinician -collected and self -collection) are mild physical discomfort , pain and temporary increase in vaginal 
spotting lasting [ADDRESS_1227292] of care.  Self-collection has a small increase in false negatives compared to clinician collection due 
sample errors. In a study by [CONTACT_878520]., concordance for HPV detection between self -collected samples and 
clinician -collected samples shows 89% agreement (81% sensitivity, 92% specificity), which is an acceptable 
concordance to justifying offering self -collection to participants in this study.20 
 
23. PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE PARTICIPANTS  
 The Principal Investigators (Drs. Fitzpatrick and Dalby) will be responsible for reviewing and monitoring all study data and any adverse events. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_878488], including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant 
recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, and other factors that can affect study 
outcomes. All unanticipated problems and adverse events  that require reporting t o the IRB  will be reported to 
the University of Wisconsin Madison (UW) Health Sciences -IRB (HS -IRB).  
 24. ECONOMIC BURDEN TO PARTICIPANTS  
 Potential costs to participants is travel to and from the community center.  
 
25. RESOURCES AVAILABLE  
 
Will the research be conducted outside School of Medicine and Public 
Health or UW Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059] (e.g. the researcher does not have an SMPH research feasibility attestation for this study)?    X☐ YES (complete 25.1)  
☐ NO (remove text below, but

 Feasibility of recruiting:  
- Estimates of Hmong, Karen, and Burmese and Karenni women in the Milwaukee area was calculated 
by [CONTACT_878521] 2019 by [CONTACT_878522] 50.52% in the US population are women.  
- Number of Hmong women in the Milwaukee area age 30 to 64 is approximately 2001.  
- Number of Burmese women in the Milwaukee area age 30 to 64 is approximately 1273.  
- Estimate recruitment will be 80 Hmong, 48 Karen, 48 Burmese  and 64  Karenni participants  
- These are not true estimates of the number of women in the population we are recruiting from due to age and specific ethnicity. Inclusion of women in this study is between age 25- 65 and Hmong, Karen, 
Burmese  or Karenni. Karenni and Karen  is a smaller ethnic group commonly grouped together with 
other ethnic groups categorized in the general Burmese ethnic group.  
- Potential participants the research team has access to is not yet determined, although MCHH routinely recruits for and conducts educational workshops in which 368 participants were recruited between July 
1, 2020 and June 30, 2021.  
- Additional resources and networks will be provided through collaboration with the City of Milwaukee 
Health Department.

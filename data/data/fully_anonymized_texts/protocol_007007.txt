2 Protocol Summary  
 
Title:  Distress tolerance and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467469]  (OAT) , Phase 2  
Population:  4 individuals  receiving OAT who are regularly using benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467470]:  This study conducts a  13-week Distress Tolerance  – Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467471] (DT -BD) psychosocial intervention paired with 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467472].  
 
This psychosocial treatment intervention  uses a combination of 
interoceptive exposure therapy and elements of acceptance and 
commitment therapy (ACT) to assist individuals in tolerating 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467473].  It will also p rovide 
psychoeducation about benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467474].  
  
Objectives : Primary Objective: To pi[INVESTIGATOR_467475] -BD intervention in OAT patients 
discontinuing BZD use  and assess ing the strengths and limitations  of 
the intervention.  
Design /Methodology : Implementation study, 1 3 weeks, 14 visits (1 baseline assessment + 
13 study visits)  
Total Study Duration:  Approximately [ADDRESS_599205] Participation Duration:  Approximately 3 hours for baseline assessment, 30 minutes  for 
each  physician visit  (13 physicia n visits)  and 60 minutes for each 
therapy visit  (9 therapy visits)

3.1 Background Information  
 
The u se of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (BZDs) among opi[INVESTIGATOR_195297] (OAT) patients has been 
associated with lower treatment retention1, use of cocaine2, and overdose mortality3,4. As such, there is 
great concern that BZD use makes OAT less safe and less effective. BZD use is common among OAT 
patients, varies by [CONTACT_467529], and ranges from 13 -74% among methadone patient s and 20 -
43% among buprenorphine patients3,5-7. The most common motivations for BZD use in opi[INVESTIGATOR_467476], to get high, and to manage sleep8-11. Because BZD use among OAT patients is often 
felt to be therapeutic, motivation to discontin ue BZDs may be expected to be low. Yet when OAT 
patients who were using BZDs were asked if they would consider reducing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_467477], 40% 
reported they would10. 
Given the high prevalence of BZD use and its negative consequences in the OAT population , there 
has been surprisingly little work investigating strategies to discontinue BZD use in this group. Efficacious 
strategies to reduce long -term regular BZD use typi[INVESTIGATOR_187718] a gradual BZD taper, but more than half 
of patients do not tolerate the wi thdrawal period and approximately half of those that do, relapse 
within a month12,13. Augmenting the BZD taper with a psychosocial intervention is more effective than a 
taper alone in general population studies14-16.  
The standard of care for BZD discontin uation typi[INVESTIGATOR_467478] a gradual BZD taper that can 
last from 4 -16 weeks , and sometimes longer . Research supports  augment ing the taper  with a 
psychosocial intervention such as relaxation therapy (RT) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)  for 
benzod iazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467479], including at [LOCATION_011] 
Medical Center . This is often because of unavailability of evidence -based psychosocial interventions in 
many settings where patients are tapered off of BZDs.  Other non -BZD pharmacological treatments are 
sometimes given such as antidepressants and non -hypnotic benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467480].  
Regarding the psychosocial intervention, l ittle is known about which type of approach  might be 
most effective in assisting OAT patients to discontinue BZDs.  Two trials have tested a psychosocial 
intervention aimed at assisting BZD discontinuation which have explicitly included substance use 
disord er (SUD) patients17,18, one of which was in a group of methadone maintenance patients18. Both 
tested a traditional cognitive behavioral approach and neither was effective in reducing BZD use 
compared to control. One approach that may be more effective invo lves improving their Distress 
Tolerance (DT), defined as an individual’s perceived ability to experience and endure negative emotional 
and physical states. DT -based approaches, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_187718] a combination of exposure therapy 
and Acceptance and Co mmitment Therapy (ACT)19-22, have increased abstinence in smokers23 and 
improved DT in SUD patients21. ACT aims to elicit acceptance of negative thoughts, feelings, and 
sensations that are interfering with the ability to behave in a way that i s consistent with one’s values. 
Additionally, use of exposure therapy, particularly interoceptive exposure (exposure to somatic 
sensations of anxiety), improves BZD discontinuation in panic disorder patients24,25. Furthermore, ACT 
has been found to be effective for tre atment of anxiety disorders26 and is a promising intervention for 
relapse prevention in SUD patients27 and insomnia28,29, the three most common motivations for BZD use 
among OAT patients (anxiety, euphoria, sleep).  Thus an approach involving interoceptive exposure and 
ACT may help patients tolerate BZD withdrawal symptoms and the underlying anxiety, BZD cravings, and 
insomnia that led to the initial BZD use by [CONTACT_467530], feelings and 
sensations caused by [CONTACT_467531] -oriented behaviors .

This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, applicable regulatory requirements, and 
BMC/BU Medical Campus Human Research Protection policies and procedures.  
 
3.2 Rationale  and Purpos e  
The rationale for this line of research is that a DT -focused approach may help teach OAT patients who 
use BZDs the skills to improve their ability to tolerate the distress from BZD withdrawal symptoms and 
the symptoms that lead to BZD relapse (e.g. anxi ety, cravings). The overall goal of this line of research is 
to develop  a DT -based intervention in order to help OAT patients who use BZDs to improve their distress 
tolerance and thereby 1) increase likelihood of BZD discontinuation and 2) decrease risk of later relapse 
to BZD use.  
 
The goal of this proposed study is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t test a Distress Tolerance – Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_99678] 
(DT-BD) intervention  for OAT patients using BZDs, and to assess the applicability and feasibility of this 
intervention through  treatment retention and  qualitative interviews of 4 participants rec eiving OAT who 
regularly use BZDs. Participants will be interviewed to assess strengths and limitations of intervention. 
Data from the interviews will be used to refine the intervention condition.  
 
 
4 Objectives  
 
4.1 Study Objectives  
 
Primary Objective:  We aim  to pi[INVESTIGATOR_467475]-BD intervention  in patients currently receiving OAT  who 
regularly use BZDs , in order to  assess  feasibility  of the intervention and assess strengths and limitations 
of the  DT-BD intervention . Our primary goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_467481] a later randomized controlled trial.  
 
4.2 Study Outcome Measures  
 
4.2.1 Primary Outcome Measure s 
 
This study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_467482]-BD intervention  with the aim of assessing its strengths and 
limitations. Thus , the primary outcome is the  acceptability  and feasibility  of the interventions assessed 
by [CONTACT_417332] s of the participants. Durin g and at completion of the intervention, participants 
will be asked to provide extensive feedback on the content of the intervention, method of delivery, and 
structure.  
 
4.2.2 Secondary Outco me Measur es 
 
The study’s secondary outcome measure s include completion of intervention,  BZD use by [CONTACT_467532]-report , use of illicit drugs or alcohol by [CONTACT_467533]-report , BZD withdrawal 
symptom s, anxiety and depression symptoms, sleep quality, and distress tolerance measures.  
 
[ADDRESS_599206] s of 14 study visits: the first visit consists of the  baseline assessment  and the first 
therapy visit , 4 subsequent weekly therapy visits , then  a 9-week BZD taper  which includes therapy visits  
(see Study Intervention section). Some participants may be prescribed non -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467483] [e.g. selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRI) for a nxiety or hypnotics for insomnia] as per standard clinical care. Data collection will 
occur starting at the baseline assessment.  
 
 
6 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
6.1 Risks  
 
Participants will be carefully screened at the beginning and closely monitored during the study 
procedures. Eligible individuals will be informed of each study procedure and the associated potential 
risks . Participants will be informed about the risks associated with the study itself, as well as the risks 
involved with the benzodiaze pi[INVESTIGATOR_467484]. Participants will be informed that risks involved with the taper 
are happening as a part of their clinical care and not for research purposes.  Potential risks will include:  
a. Subjective discomfort . It is possible that a specific focus on particip ants’ BZD use and other drug 
use behaviors could produce some distress. Other subjective distress may be related to the 
interoceptive exposure procedures and administration of the distress tolerance laboratory tasks 
(breath -holding and mirror tracing persi stence task – computerized version [MTPT -C]) including 
temporary discomfort, such as frustration and other temporary symptoms of psychological 
stress. Any distress will be minimized by [CONTACT_467534], 
that they can r efuse to answer any particular question they do not want to answer, discontinue 
any laboratory task, and are free to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. In 
addition, referrals will be provided to participants during consent and will be ava ilable upon 
request, in the event that participants are experiencing distress related to the study protocol or 
otherwise. Any distress will be minimized by [CONTACT_467535], that they can refuse to answer any particula r question they do not want to answer, 
discontinue any laboratory task, and are free to withdraw from the study at any time without 
penalty.  During the course of participation in the research, a participant may have questions 
about the assessment procedur e, interoceptive exposure procedures, or distress tolerance 
tasks. A project staff member or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_467485]. To prevent 
discomfort or embarrassment, staff undergoes considerable training in building rapport and 
skillful int erviewing. Research staff members will available to answer questions subjects may 
have about the assessment. Subjects are informed prior to the assessment that they may 
choose to skip any question or procedure they find uncomfortable. Discomfort experience d 
during the distress tolerance tasks is expected to dissipate soon after participants terminate the 
tasks. The close monitoring of objective and subjective effects by [CONTACT_1171], 
interviewing, and self -ratings will allow emergent adverse effects t o be detected immediately. If 
Distress tolerance and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467466], Phase 2   Version 1.15 , 
June 2021   
 
Page 7 of 27 any individual becomes overly distressed or distraught, the assessment will be stopped 
immediately and a staff clinician will talk privately with the affected individual(s).  In addition, 
referrals will be provided to participa nts during consent and will be available upon request, in 
the event that participants are experiencing distress related to the study protocol or otherwise.  
b. Coercion.  There is a potential for issues related to coercion to participate in this study. 
Particip ants may feel that receipt of OAT or their standing in the OAT clinic is dependent on 
participation in the study. Participants will be reminded throughout the study that participation 
is voluntary and that the study team will assist the participant in reco nnecting with their 
outpatient BZD provider. Additionally, the study physician will bridge the participant’s 
medication as needed so that there is no gap in treatment.  
c. Breach of confidentiality.  It is possible that data collection could result in breach o f 
confidentiality. For participants in the proposed study, breach of confidentiality in self -report 
data could reveal that they are engaging in illegal behavior (i.e., breaking laws against 
possession and use of controlled substances in [LOCATION_005]). How ever, the risk of breach of 
confidentiality is also modest, given the safeguards protecting the participants’ data.  
d. Overdose . When the BZD taper begins, participants will begin to be provided a week’s worth of 
BZD medication on a weekly basis until the taper is completed. BZDs when taken in high doses in 
combination with OAT can cause over sedation  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and can increase the 
risk of o verdose death. The risk of causing overdose by [CONTACT_1541] a week of BZD medication in 
those already prescribed BZDs is the same or less  than usual , given these participants are 
already receiving BZDs on a weekly or longer basis. For those not prescribed BZD s, there is an 
increased risk of overdose if participants take BZDs in greater quantity than we prescribe to 
them or if they are combining the BZDs we prescribe with other respi[INVESTIGATOR_467486] . But 
there are risks of not prescribing BZDs to this group; these participants have reporte d regularly 
using BZDs obtained illicitly and may already be taking them in overdose or are at risk of BZD 
withdrawal. We will minimize overdose risk by [CONTACT_467536][INVESTIGATOR_467487]’s addiction disorder. We wil l obtain weekly urine drug and 
breathalyzer  tests to monitor for substance use including respi[INVESTIGATOR_467488]. We will also be monitoring for over sedation  during weekly physi cian visits 
which may lead to a temporary hold of BZD medication. And finally, we will be conducting a pi[INVESTIGATOR_467489] (see Study Intervention ). 
e. Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_188560].  All participants in this study will undergo gradual discontinuation 
of BZDs . All participants will be informed of potential risks, including those related to adverse 
effects from the BZD discontinuation process. Possible adver se effects of BZD taper include: 
anxiety, insomnia, irritability, nightmares, sensory disturbances, tremor, tinnitus, anorexia, 
diarrhea, and nausea. If the BZD taper is improperly administered (too rapid), then possible 
adverse effects include hypertension, fever, delirium, hallucinations, seizures, and death. 
Participants in prior BZD discontinuation trials very rarely required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157194] a direct 
resul t of the BZD taper. All participants will receive a medical alert bracelet and emergency card 
to inform medical providers that they are receiving a BZD taper.  Comprehensive screening will 
exclude participants who would be placed at  significant risk , such a s prior benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467490], as a result of participation in this study.  
f. Medication Adverse Effects . Some participants will receive SSRI s for anxiety/mood symptoms 
and/or non -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467491], if these symptoms occur during the BZD 
taper. Side effects of SSRIs may include: nausea, diarrhea, weight gain, dizziness, blurred vision, 
Distress tolerance and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467466], Phase [ADDRESS_599207] side effects. For trazodone, side effects may include: 
dizziness, sweating, blurred vision, and less commonly, confusion, headache, change in heart 
rate, and shortnes s of breath. For mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], side effects may include: decreased or increased 
movement, confusion, shortness of breath, and rash.  
g. Interoceptive Exposure Risks : Interoceptive exposure approaches focus on providing patients 
additional practice in tolerating  somatic sensations that trigger benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467492]. The participant may be asked to hyperventilate, head roll, or 
jog in place. The participants will be provided with a description of the tasks, sensations the 
exercises will evoke, and strategies to attend to and tolerate these symptoms. Participants will 
also be existed to inform research staff of any pre -existing conditions that the tasks may 
exacerbate, so the research team may personalize the exercise. There  are a ssociated risks with 
these  tasks, if the participants has pre -existing physical health concerns (e.g. high blood 
pressure, heart problems, or joint pain). Hyperventilation may have dizziness, light -headedness, 
numbness, blurred vision, and hot flashes or sweating. Participants may be asked to jog in place, 
which will increase heart rate and may cause joint, muscle or ligament strain (depending on the 
physical shape of the participant). These tasks will be very low impact and for brief time spans, 
and the study provider will terminat e the exercise as needed. If the participant is unable to 
complete these tasks at all, due to previous health conditions, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_467493].  
 
6.2 Potential Benefits  
 
Anticipated b enefits are as follows: 1) all participants may have lower risk of BZD misuse , overdose 
death, and OAT treatment failure as a result of discontinuing BZD use, 2) if found to be effective, this 
treatment could reduce the health risks of BZD use in the popul ation of patients receiving OAT, and 3) 
the results will be used to advance understanding of the roles of distress tolerance in BZD 
discontinuation.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_599208] risks to participants are related to the BZD taper , which is happening as part of the 
participant’s clinical care and not for research purposes . If the BZD taper is properly administered, the 
risk of serious adverse effects is low. Because BZD use has been associated with negative consequences 
including overdose death in the patients taking OAT, the risks are judged to be acceptable relative to the 
anticipate d benefits.

8 Study Intervention  
 
Experimental condition  
 
In the study’s experimental condition , Distress Tolerance - Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_99678] (DT -BD), is a 
psychosocial intervention paired with a gradual benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467484]. The aim of the psychosocial 
intervention is to improve individuals’ ab ility to tolerate distress in order to assist benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467494]. There will be [ADDRESS_599213] . 
 
The DT -BD intervention combines elements of existing psychosocial interventions. Specifically, 
interoceptive exposure techniques will be paired with elements of acceptance and commitment therapy 
(ACT) and relapse prevention (RP). Interoceptive exposure inv olves inducing symptoms that trigger 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467495] (eg. Hyperventilation , head rolling, and 
jogging in place  to mimic the dizziness  and shortness of breath  commonly observed in people  who are 
having a panic  attack ). The purpose of interoceptive exposure is to decrease the fear of symptoms 
associated with benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467496]. ACT teaches people skills in accepting  distress in the service of their 
values rather than resisting or avoiding that distress, which may make distress worse or prolong it. Thus , 
these ACT -based skills are the ideal partner for interoceptive exposure exercises in that they will assist 
particip ants in enduring the distress induced by [CONTACT_467539], the symptoms of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_188560].  
 
After the baseline visit, i n the first [ADDRESS_599214] 
will clarify the partici pant’s values, discuss the role of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467497], Phase [ADDRESS_599215] will continue to work with the participant on 
interoceptive exposure exercises and the importance of participant’s values, introduce mindfulness, 
teach relapse prevention skills, and do ACT -based exercises that teach cognitive defusion and 
willingness.

June 2021   
 
Page 11 of 27 Description of Distress Tolerance – Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467499] p articipants will undergo BZD discontinuation. For those participants prescribed BZDs, we will obtain 
permission from those participants to contact [CONTACT_3038] ’ outpatient prescribers. We will inform 
those prescribers of the participants’ intent to discontinue BZD use and we will ask those prescribers not 
to continue prescribing BZDs during the study.  
 
The following description of the BZD taper protocol is a us ual clinical care BZD taper. Patients at [LOCATION_011] 
Medical Center (BMC) might receive such a taper, though there may be slight differences based on 
clinician or patient preferences. Other clinicians at BMC have been consulted about this taper who agree 
that this protocol fits in the range of usual clinical care.  
 
We will check the [LOCATION_005] prescription monitoring program to determine the recent BZD dose. 
For those participants not prescribed BZDs, we will determine the baseline BZD dose through self -
report. Once the starting BZD dose is determined, we will maintain participants on this dose until the 
start of the BZD taper (likely week 2 and 3 of study). Participants will see a study physician weekly to 
receive their BZD medication for the week until  the taper is completed. BZD discontinuation in this study 
will consist of a gradual BZD taper in dose over [ADDRESS_599216]  trials used a gradual 
taper of 8 -10 weeks. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_467500] 4 to 16 weeks, and sometimes 
longer (though research suggests that very long tapers of >6 months in OAT patients rarely lead to 
successful discontinuation18). The taper will be fle xible in that the study  physician will utilize clinical 
judgement to lengthen the taper if necessary, depending on the severity of the participant’s withdrawal 
symptoms. Anchor points will be set (33 % reduction in dose after  2 weeks, 5 0% mid -treatment, 100 % by 
[CONTACT_5875] 8 ) to emphasize the time -limited nature of the taper.   
 
Safety monitoring for participants will be supervised by [CONTACT_5989]. Participants may have BZD 
medication temporarily held if the participant is felt to be over -sedated or tests pos itive for  illicit drugs 
that are respi[INVESTIGATOR_467486] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_467501]).  We will also conduct pi[INVESTIGATOR_467502] . If a participant’s number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_467503] >20%, then the study team will meet 
and discuss the poss ibility of the participant’s discontinuation from the study.

Page 12 of 27 9.1 Recruit ment  
Patients will be recruited from Health Care Resource Centers  (HCRC ) [LOCATION_011], Faster Paths to Treatment  
Urgent Care Center at [LOCATION_011] Medical Center (BMC), the Behavioral Health Clinic (BHC) clinic at [LOCATION_011] 
Medical Center (BMC), and the Office Based Addiction Treatment (OBAT) Program at BMC. HCRC [LOCATION_011] 
provides OAT treatment for over [ADDRESS_599218] study staff wait outside patients’  clinical appointments in one of the above referenced 
settings to ask if they would be interested in learning more about a research opportunity. If the patient  
indicates interest,  then a member of the research team will bring them to an identified private space in 
the clinic that does not interfere with their clinical appointment . Any discussion of the study will only 
occur in a private space. In the private space, they will be provided more details about the research 
study. If they are interested, p otential participants will be asked to complete a brief screening interview  
using the study screening script  that will involve asking questions based on the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. If no private space is available, interested participants will be given a study flier with study 
details and research contact [CONTACT_3031], and/or collect their contact [CONTACT_467540] a later time to provide more i nformation about the study and conduct the screening 
interview over the phone.  
Participants who appear to meet study criteria  and are interested in participating, will be scheduled for 
a more comprehensive baseline assessment.  At the baseline assessment, before delivering informed 
consent, research staff will review/confirm eligibility criteria previously done during initial screen. If the 
participant does not meet eligibly criteria (e.g. recently becoming pregnant), they will be unable to 
participate in t he study and the eligibility data collected at baseline will be destroyed. For those who are 
eligible and consent, the eligibility criteria checklist will be saved along with their research study 
documentation. For those who are eligible but do not consent , their eligibility checklist will be 
destroyed.  
IRB approved advertisements/fliers may be posted throughout [LOCATION_011] Medical Center or its network of 
affiliated behavioral health clinics with permission. IRB approved advertisements may also be placed in 
newspapers.  
 
9.2 Consent  
Candidates will be asked for informed consent before the comprehensive baseline assessment. 
Informed consent will be conducted in person in a private office in the BMC Department of Psychiatry’s 
Research Center in the Doctor’s Office Building  or in the Behavior al Health Clinic (BHC) clinic in the 
Dowling Building at  [LOCATION_011] Medical Center (BMC ). Participants will then be asked to sign a consent form.  
Distress tolerance and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467466], Phase 2   Version 1.15 ,

to read , or participants will be able to access an electronic version of these forms and can  provide an e -
signature [CONTACT_467551] ( phone, computer, or tablet/Ipad ) with their 
finger, mouse, surface pen, etc.  Appropriately qualified and trained study personnel will explain all 
aspects of the study in lay language and answer all of the study candidate’s questions. Study staff 
members are trained in [LOCATION_011] University Medical Center (BUMC) IRB policy and wil l closely follow 
consent procedures as outlined by [CONTACT_467541]. Research staff will explain all aspects of the study, 
including the intervention approach, experimental nature of the research, potential risks and benefits, 
and the expected duration and tim e commitment of their participation.   Potential participants will be 
permitted to take an unsigned consent form home with them to think about whether or not they’d like 
to participate. From the time of explanation of the research study, potential particip ants will be allotted 
[ADDRESS_599219] his/her understanding of the project, 
the purpose and procedures involved, and the voluntary nature of his/her participation. Those who 
cannot successfully answer the items on the Capacity Questionnaire will have the study re -explained by 
[CONTACT_9872] a focus on aspects they did not understand. Those who demonstrate understanding 
of the study and vol untarily agree to participate will be asked to sign the Informed Consent Form. 
Participants will be given , mailed, emailed (depending on preference)  a copy  of their signed consent 
form.  No baseline assessments will begin until after a signed research conse nt form is obtained.  
 
 
9.3 Baseline Assessment  
See schedule of events for breakdown of assessments and study timeline  
 
 
Baseline Assessment :  
 
After informed consent is obtained, participants will begin the ir baseline assessment s. The baseline 
assessment s will be delivered in person , either at our research office  or at a BMC clinical space .  
 
First, participants will be delivered a urine drug test and pregnancy test , and the 30-day Timeline 
Followback (TLFB) , which will be used to measure drug use in the past 30 days. Participants will not be 
eligible to continue with the study a) if their urine drug screen shows use of illicit drugs ( including  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], cocaine, barbiturates, unprescribed z -drugs, unprescribed amphetamines, or synthetic 
cannabinoids),  b) if they report use of illicit drugs (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], cocaine, barbiturates, unprescribed 
amphetamines, unprescribed z -drugs, or synthetic cannabinoids ) in the past month, or  c) if their urine 
drug screen shows that they are currently pregnant.  The urine pregnan cy screen results will be available 
immediately  during their visit. However, the urine drug screen results may take up to several days to 
process.  
• If the urine screen shows that the participant is currently pregnant, the participant will not be 
eligible t o continue with the study and baseline assessments . These participants can return after 
[ADDRESS_599220] 30 days, they will be able to take the baseline assessments.  
Pending the results of their urine drug screen, they will be able to continue with thei r follow up 
study  visits.  
• If the participant is no t currently pregnant,  but report s use of illicit drugs (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
cocaine, barbiturates, unprescribed amphetamines, unprescribed z -drugs, or synthetic 
cannabinoids ) in the past month on the TLFB, the participant will not be eligible to continue  with 
the study and baseline assessments. These participants will have the opportunity to return in [ADDRESS_599221] month, they will be 
able to  take the baseline assessments. Pending the results of their urine drug screen, they will 
be able to continue with their follow up study visits.  
• The urine drug screen results may take up to several days to process.  If the pregnancy screen 
shows the participant is not currently pregnant, and the participant reports no use of illicit drugs 
in the past 30 days, the participant may complete the baseline assessments and receive the $[ADDRESS_599222] aff receive the results for the urine drug screen and it shows use of 
illicit drugs (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], cocaine, barbiturates, unprescribed z -drugs, unprescribed 
amphetamines, or synthetic cannabinoids) , they will not be eligible to continue with the study . 
However, if they would still like to participate in the study, they will have the opportunity to 
return in [ADDRESS_599223] 30 days, 
and there  is no presence of illicit drugs  from their urine screen , they will be enrolled in the 
study.  
 
For those who are not eligible to be in the study and/or choose not to return after [ADDRESS_599224] convenient and appropriate for the patient. Participants who complete the surveys online will be 
sent REDCap survey links to their emails or mobile phone. A trained research assistant  (RA) will coll ect 
demographic informa tion and administer the Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)30, a 
brief,  15-minute psychiatric diagnostic interview.  Motivation for BZD use, alcohol and other drug use by 
[CONTACT_6270]-report, BZD withdrawal symptoms, distress tolerance measures, affect and sleep symptoms , and 
suicidal ideation  will also be assessed during the baseline assessment.  Participants who complete the 
baseline assessments will receive a $[ADDRESS_599225] for their time and 
participation.  
 
Daily assessment:  In addition to the assessments listed in the table above, we will measure substance 
use, BZD medication adherence, and sleep duration and quality on a daily basis. Each participant will be 
sent a daily REDCap survey link either to their mobile phone number or email, and asked to complete a 
brief questionnaire for the previous day.  Participants will be sent the survey link through REDCap to 
their email address or, if preferred, to their mobile phone number using Twilio, a third party serv ice, 
Distress tolerance and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467466], Phase [ADDRESS_599226] session of the  intervention .  
 
9.4 Assessment Tools  
 
BZD and Other Drug Use. We will measure benzodiazapi[INVESTIGATOR_467504]32,33. At baseline and weekly through the taper, we will measure alcohol, BZD, OAT, and 
illicit drug use with urine screening and self-report. T he 30 -day Timeline Followback (TLFB)34 will be used 
to measure self -report of drug use at baseline. We will send a REDCap survey link to the  participants’ 
mobile phone  number or email  to measure substance use during the week.  Urine BZD tests will include 
immunoassay for all BZDs and liquid chr omatography –mass spectrometry for lorazepam and 
clonazepam, as these BZDs have a high false negative rate on immunoassay tests35,36. A breathalyzer test 
will be performed at each visit. We will assess for BZD withdrawal symptoms using the Clinical Institut e 
Withdrawal Assessment -Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (CIWA -B)37.  
 
BZD Medication Adherence.  We will send a daily REDCap survey link to the participant’s email or mobile 
phone to assess daily BZD medication adherence .   
 
Affect and Sleep. At each visit, a nxiety  symptoms will be assessed using the Overall Anxiety Severity and 
Impairment  Scale (OASIS)38 and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9)39 will be used to assess 
depression  symptoms . Sleep quality will be assessed using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI)40 at 
baseline and on a weekly basis. Additionally, sleep duration and sleep quality will be measured on a daily 
basis using a REDCap survey link.   
 
Distress Tolerance. Self-reported DT measures will include t he Distress Intolerance Index41, the 
Acceptance and  Action Questionnaire -II42 and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index43. Behavioral DT measures 
will include breath holding  and the computerized Mirror Tracing Persistence Task (MTPT -C)44.  
 
Suicidal Ideation:  At the baseline assessment, we will measure suicide risk, severity and immediacy of 
risk, and level of support needed using the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).   
 
Feasibility and Acceptability. We will measure recruitment and retention rate s, number of visits   
attended, and part icipant feedback of intervention during an in-depth qualitative exit interview.  
 
In this study, data will be collected from participants who are or may present to assessment and 
intervention appointments intoxicated. Upon arrival to intervention and assessment appointments, all 
participants will receive a Breathalyzer test prior to ass essment interviews; if a participant appears 
intoxicated or impaired, the RA will reschedule the interview. If participants experience anxiety and 
insomnia during the BZD taper, we will offer an SSRI or a dose increase if already prescribed for anxiety, 
and non -BZD hypnotics (e.g. trazodone or mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) for insomnia.

Exit interview  – At the end of the taper, participants will undergo a n in-depth qualitative exit interview . 
Interviews will be audio recorded , and written notes containing no individual participant identifiers will 
be taken by [CONTACT_21118]. Participants will be asked to provide extensive feedback during exit interviews to 
assess what was/was  not helpful, what would have been helpful, and any feedback  on intervention 
content, method of delivery, or structure.  
 
Participants will receive  $30 at baseline visit  and will be paid $2 for each daily mobile assessment from 
week 2 to week 13 (earning up to $1 68).  They  will additionally receive a $[ADDRESS_599228] -
intervention interview. Participants can earn up to $[ADDRESS_599229] Operating Procedure for Safety Assessments  
Endorsement of Suicidality, Risk to Self or Other s (SSOP) Safety Assessment Form. If  the participants 
brings up thoughts of suicide or self -harm, research staff will utilize the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C -SSRS)  to assess participant risk . If the participant brings up intent or harm others,  abuse, neglect 
or other reportable conditions, research staff will complete the Acute Safety Assessment to probe 
frequency and  severity of the concern to identify participants who may be at immediate  risk and require 
further intervention. Upon completion of the C-SSRS  and/or Acute  Safety Assessment , research staff will 
contact [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_467505]. PI [INVESTIGATOR_467506].  
 
Removal of Participants  
All instances of study drop out will be documented, including reason for dropout, who decided the 
participant would drop out (participant, study staff or PI), and whether the drop out resulted f rom 
burden of intervention, study assessment, or another reason . Withdrawn participants will be 
encouraged to participate in the exit interview to provide feedback on why the intervention did not 
work for them and suggestions for improvement. Participants may withdraw voluntarily at any time for 
any reason.  If the participants withdraw from the study or the intervention, they will be asked to return 
the mobile phones.  
 
There are two types of participant withdrawal: “intervention withdrawal” and “study with drawal”.  
 
1. Intervention withdrawal:  A participant drops out of the treatment (either because they are no 
longer interested or because the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_467507]), but 
still provides the research team with post -intervention  data by [CONTACT_467542] . 
2. Study withdrawal:  A participant (or provider on behalf of participant) explicitly communicates 
that they are no longer interest ed in being a part of the study at all, including future 
assessments and comp ensation. Cases of intervention withdrawal are not automatically 
considered to be study withdrawal unless the participant specifically states that they never wish 
to be contact[CONTACT_467543], or if the study investigator deems any future contact [CONTACT_467544].

they report using these substances a total of 3 times during the study . 
• If there is evidence of ongoing substance use of illicit substances , they may be removed and 
referred to a higher level of treatment including inpatient detoxification or residential 
treatment . 
• If the participant becomes pregnant over the  course of the study.  
• If the stud y investigator or treating provider feels the study is negatively impacting the 
participant’s health or wellbeing resulting in increasing severity of illness that is clinically 
assessed as such by [CONTACT_9154]. Such cases will be assessed clinically and study PI [INVESTIGATOR_467509].  
• If the participant becomes suicidal and presents with clinically determined safety risk to self or 
others.  
 
 
10 Assessment of Safety  and Data Sa fety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
The following definitions will be used in the assessment of safety:  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is an y adverse event that  
(1) results in death;  
(2) is life -threatening;  
(3) results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
(4) results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
(5) results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
(6) based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject's health and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition 
(examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive treatment in the 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Life-threatening  means that the event places the subject  at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred.  
 
Distress tolerance and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467466], Phase 2   Version 1.15 , 
June 2021   
 
Page 18 of 27 Unanticipated Problem  is defined as an event, experience or outcome that meets all three  of the 
following criteria:  
• is unexpected ; AND  
• is related or possibly related  to participation in the rese arch; AND  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk  of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Possibly related  means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_51408], severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with either:  
• the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the 
research that are described in (a) the protocol –related documents, such as the IR B-approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed 
consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package inserts; or  
• the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the 
subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the 
adverse event.  
 
10.2 Safety Review  
 
Both the risks listed in Section 4.1 and unknown risks will be monitor ed as follows:  
 
The study PI, Tae Woo Park, will review and update this protocol and all procedures  as needed  and will 
provide oversight. Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_941] P I in consultation with mentors , the IRB  and NIDA, the 
study sponsor.  
 
What is Monitored. All procedures will be monitored to ensure that they conform to the approved 
protocol. In addition, monitoring will be done of all unforeseen circumstances that might arise and 
affect safety; of all reports  of serious adverse events as defined above;  of other significant adverse 
events (adverse events that lead to drop out by [CONTACT_467545]); and 
of unexpected adverse events resulting from the study.  
 
Frequency of Monitori ng. Monitoring of adherence to the study protocol and emergent unanticipated 
adverse events will be conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_84886]. This monitoring will be discussed with 
mentors during regularly scheduled meetings. Participants will be given cont act information so that they 
can inform study staff of events that occur in between study visits. In addition, monitoring by [CONTACT_467546]. 
 
Oversight. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_467510]. Each intervention 
project will have a yearly review of its DSMP during the regular continuing review process, outlining the 
following points: (a) reassessment of the risks and benefits to study participants, (b) participant 
recruitment, accrual, and retention, (c) data quality and confidentiality, (d) consideration of external 
scientific or therapeutic developments with impact on the safety of participants or the e thics of the

modifications to the protocol or DSMP will be communicated to NIDA, the study sponsor.  
 
 
10.3 Reporting Plans  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_51398]/BU Medical Campus will report Unanticipated Problems, safety 
monitors’ reports, and Adverse Events to the BMC/BU Medical Center IRB in accordance with IRB 
policies:  
• Unanticipated Problems occurring at BMC/BU Medical Campus involving a f atal or life -threatening 
event will be reported to the IRB within 2 days of the investigator learning of the event.  
• Unanticipated Problems occurring at BMC/BU Medical Campus not involving a fatal or life -
threatening event will be reported to the IRB within  7 days of the investigator learning of the 
event.  
• Reports from safety monitors with recommended changes will be reported to the IRB within 7 
days of the investigator receiving the report.  
• Adverse Events (including Serious Adverse Events) will be reported  in summary at the time of 
continuing review, along with a statement that the pattern of adverse events, in total, does not 
suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously 
known.  
• Reports from safety monitor s with no recommended changes will be reported to the IRB at the 
time of continuing review.  
 
10.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_467512]-defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. Should a fatal or life -threatening overdose/withdrawal 
event occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_467513], the  IRB, and 
NIDA.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_599230] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
 
11.1 Confidentiality  
 
Coded data: A unique ID will be used to identify individual records, and all data and samples will be 
labeled only with this study ID number (i.e., not the participant’s name, date of birth, medical record 
number, etc). The unique study ID will be linked to participant identifiers via a mastercode/key. 
Restricted access to participant contacts  information and the mastercode /key will be limited to 
members of the research staff as necessary to complete their duties. Locator/contact [CONTACT_32431] a 
master enrollment list will include identifiers, but participant names will not be entered into the 
analytical database. The mast ercode/key that links study data to identifiers will be stored separately 
from the study data (i.e., in separate physical files and separate databases) and protected as described 
below.  
 
Distress tolerance and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467466], Phase [ADDRESS_599231] Privacy: The research study t eam will assure high quality 
forms, monitor data quality, and track and link the multiple data sources. Data will be linked and 
entered using multiple checks. The research study team will manage  data collection forms, design the 
database management system for data entered and for participant tracking, implement procedures for 
quality control, and provide statistical programming.  
All data for study purposes will be collected with Apple iPad tablets or electronic survey links using the 
[LOCATION_011] University Medic al Campus’ installation of REDCap data collection system, a software tool 
developed at Vanderbilt University and made available through the Clinical and Translational Science 
Awards network (CTSAs). To help protect and secure the data stored in REDCap’s da tabase, the software 
application employs several methods to protect against malicious users who may attempt to identify 
and exploit any security vulnerabilities in the system. Access to the REDCap data entry website will be 
based on permissions granted by [CONTACT_467547] (OIT). Only authorized study members will be able to enter or view data. The login 
information (username) of the person submitting the information, the date and time submitted, and 
other navigational information will be automatically obtained and stored in the database.   
[LOCATION_011] University’s installation of REDCap is HIPAA compliant. Infor mation posted on forms will be 
electronically encrypted using secure socket layering (SSL) encryption technology so that only the 
intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_290744].  Data will reside on a secure, password protected server at 
[LOCATION_011] University Medical Center (BUMC) to which only designated individuals have access, thus 
providing a secure environment for all project data.  The database will be automatically backed up on a 
nightly basis.  Files stored on BUMC servers will be protected by [CONTACT_85405] ‘firew alls’ that restrict access 
to designated users.  Restrictions and permissions to update the database will be controlled through the 
REDCap web application.  
Because the server will be part of the BUMC network NT domain, only connections from users 
authentic ated from the domain controller are accepted, thus providing a secure environment for all 
Center data. Specifically, the policy for computer systems security implemented at BUMC:  
• Provide physical security of data.  All central systems are physically secure d behind locked doors 
with access restricted to key personnel in the OIT.  Access through the primary door is also 
protected by [CONTACT_467548] -site central emergency response 
security control center.  Written policies exi st for contingencies to provide access to the room to 
those not explicitly authorized.  
• Provide virtual security via connectivity.  Internal access to all systems is done via Microsoft 
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol.  With the exception of inte rnet provider -based 
services, external client access must first gain access to the internal network before connecting 
to the systems.  This connection is initiated via a Virtual Private Network connection using Point -
to-Point Tunneling Protocol or through the University's modem pool which require Kerberos 
authentication.  
All data are protected with disaster recovery via several methods:  
• Hardware redundancy:  Several stages of redundancy exist at the hardware level to minimize 
failure:  dual -redundant power supplies exist on each disk array; hot -spare disk is configured to 
automatically self -heal in the event of a disk failure in the array; emergency power generators 
Distress tolerance and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_467466], Phase 2   Version 1.15 , 
June 2021   
 
Page 21 of 27 ensure a 100% electrical uptime; and uninterrupted power supplies present the systems with 
conditioned steady -state power.  
• Data backup:  The data are backed up on a regular schedule.  All tapes are moved off -site on a 
daily basis and are stored in a fire -proof safe.  Cycle -time of backups is approximately two 
months with the exception of a yearly archive which is retained for a one -year period.  
• Data Security:  All data are stored on NT File Systems with password -protected files and 
directories.  
The BUMC REDCap  Server has implemented a mix of preventive and detective security measures:  
• Two factor au thentication required for both admin and user access  
• Require a password change every quarter for users  
• Server is placed behind data center firewall  
• Requires two -factor authentication and only permits for specific admin(s) that need to access 
the server  
• Inform PIs that they need to remove investigators who are no longer involved, and periodically 
(ideally quarterly) review accounts  
• Server is protected by [CONTACT_467549] (firewalls/snort)   
• Server is part of change management and vulne rability management programs to ensure server 
is patched within 30 days of vulnerability notification  
 
Electronic survey links will be sent to participant's emails or phone numbers using REDCap and REDCap 
enabled feature, Twilio.  Twilio is a third -party we b service that provides the functionality for researchers 
to send REDCap survey invitations via SMS text messaging.   Twilio will have access to the participant's 
phone number.   When a BU REDCap admin enables Twilio for a REDCap project, BU REDCap verifies that 
the Twilio Request Inspector has been disabled.   This setting ensures that survey participants' phone 
numbers do not get permanently logged on Twilio's servers, but instead remain securely in the BU 
encrypted REDCap server. Twilio will not have access  to participant PHI data.  
 
The qualitative interviewers will be audiotaped, with subjects’ permission , using a digital voice recorder 
or audio recording program on our BMC encrypted study laptops.  Each digital audio file will be coded 
with subject unique identifiers, only connected to identifiers (PHI) via a separate, password -protected, 
master code. These files will be stored on a password -protected, encrypted BMC network. The coded 
audio file will additionally be sent to a commercial service for t ranscription.   
 
All paper records  (i.e. signed consent forms)  will be stored in locked storage spaces (cabinets or 
drawers) in a secure research office . Only study staff will have access to the key to get into these storage 
spaces. Participant forms will b e stored in a single folder that is labeled with their respective study ID 
number.  
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_599232] and sleep symptoms. REDCap, described more generally below, will be 
used to assess BZD med ication adherence, substance use, and sleep (sleep duration and sleep quality). 
We will ask participants to provide once daily reports via REDCap survey link sent to participant’s email 
or mobile phone.   If participants do not own a phone, we will provide them with a phone with one.   
 
This study will utilize REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a software toolset and workflow 
methodology for electronic collection and management of clinical and rese arch data, to collect and 
store assessment data. The [LOCATION_011] University School of Medicine Research Department will be used as a 
central location for data processing and management. REDCap provides a secure, web -based application 
that provides an intuitive data manipulation interface, custom reporting capabilities, audit trail 
functionality, real -time data monitoring/querying of participant records, and variations of data 
exporting/importing.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_599233] of transcribed, in -depth interviews after the completion of the BZD taper. A 
qualitative research approach will be used to analyze this data. The analysis plan is centered on several 
domains, and w ithin each of the domains, the i nvestigator will draw comparisons, looking for overlap 
and differences, themes and trends. In addition, the investigator will continually look for newly 
emerging topi[INVESTIGATOR_467514].  Though we are collecting quantitative data including substance use, 
affec t, sleep, and distress tolerance, we are only doing this for acceptability and feasibility purposes. 
This is in preparation for a future, larger trial during which we will be using these proposed measures for 
quantitative analysis.  
 
 
13 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects

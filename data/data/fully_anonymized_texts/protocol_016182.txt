02 December 2016   Confidential  Methodology:  This study will be a multiple -site, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
proof -of-concept study in approximately [ADDRESS_262862] CD involving the ileum and/or colon . 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail in subsequent sections .  
The duration of treatment will be 42 days ( six weeks ); each subject’s participation in the study will be 
approximately [ADDRESS_262863] dose of study drug .  
Subjects will be randomised in to two treatment arms : either V565 or placebo us ing a 2:1 active:  placebo 
ratio. Randomisation will be stratified  to ensure treatment groups have similar rates of prior anti -tumour 
necrosis factor alpha ( TNF α) therapy .  
Subjects will receive three V565  185 mg capsules three times daily or  matching placebo , for 42 days . The 
total daily  V565 dose is 1665 mg.  
Subjects will be treated with study drug as an add -on to any  permitted  stable medications already being taken 
for CD. No alteration of background CD medication will be permitted for the duration of the study .  
There are six study visits . Two screening visits to assess  eligibility will occur during Days -28 to Day -1; 
these are Visit  1 (start of screening), and Visit 2 (eligibility ileocolonoscopy ). Additional study visits will 
occur on Day 1 (randomisation and initiation of treatment), Day 14 (Interim Visit), Day 42  (End of 
Treatment  Visit ), and Day 56  (Follow up  Visit ).  
Collection of subject -reported variab les of the CDAI will be via diaries given to the subject at Visit  1. Prior 
to Visit 2, the subject -reported variables will be combined with the variables collected at the site on Visit [ADDRESS_262864] 
sufficient diary entries to cal culate a CDAI score, a CDAI score ≥220 to ≤450 and a CRP ≥5  mg/L (or if CRP 
is normal, FCP ≥250  µg/g) prior to Visit [ADDRESS_262865] to proceed to Visit 3 and to be randomi sed on Day 1 .   
The efficacy of V565 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_218755] , biomarkers ( CRP  or FCP), and  the 
PRO -2.  
Exploratory efficacy measures include changes in CDAI scores , changes in CRP  (or FCP) values  over time , 
the frequency of loose or watery stools  as measured by [CONTACT_218756], the degree of abdominal pain as measured 
by [CONTACT_218757], and changes in faecal  urgency . This study will also evaluate the immunogenicity of V565 .  
In an exploratory endoscopy substudy, subjects with more severe disease at the Visit 2 ileocolonoscopy 
(a SES-CD ≥7, if ileum and colon are involved or ≥4 if only the ileum is involved) will undergo a second 
ileocolonoscopy at the end of treatment (Day 42)  to evaluate changes in the mucosa . 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations will be based on concentrations of V5 65 measured  in serum and urine .   
Safety will be assessed through evaluations of adverse events ( AEs), clinical laboratory results, vital signs, 
physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and concomitant medications.  
Planned n umber of subjects:  Approximately 126 randomised to receive study drug in a 
2:1 active:placebo ratio (84:42)   
Approx imately 114 to complete ( 76:38)  based on an estimated dropout  
rate of 10% during treatment

Statistical methods:  
Determination of sample size : 
The sample size is based on being able to claim superiority of V565 over placebo; the primary endpoint is 
defined as a response ra te, based on CDAI reduction/remission and CRP  or FCP results.  
It is assumed that the proportion of subjects assigned to placebo treatment who respond is 0.15. A clinically 
important response rate on V565 is defined as 0.4. A 2:1 (V565:placebo) allocation,  80% power and 5% 
statistical significance rate estimate 76:38 evaluable subjects will be required for this study. With a 10% 
estimated non -evaluable rate, it is planned to assign 126 subjects (84:42) to randomised treatment.  
Sample size estimates are base d on a Pearson chi -square test for two proportions and  generated using SAS 
Power and Sample Size v13.2.  
A subgroup of subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_218762]-CD. However, the study is not powered to show a difference in these  endpoint s. 
Statistical Analysis : 
As appropriate, variables will be summarised descriptively (frequency and percent age will be summarised for 
categorical variables; mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum wi ll be presented for 
continuous variables) by [CONTACT_218763]. All study data will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) including dictionaries used for coding and software used will be 
finalised prior to the in itial unblinding of the study.

02 December 2016   Confidential  2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background Information  
Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) includes both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis 
as well as  other less prevalent, destructive diseases of the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract. Crohn’s 
disease is characterised by a chronic, relapsing, progressive course of intestinal inflammation 
and damage and generally begins in young adulthood. The incidence and pre valence of CD is 
increasing worldwide with current incidence of 6 to 15/100,000 and prevalence estimated at 
50 to 200/100,000 [1]. The highest incidences of CD have been reported in northern Europe, 
the [LOCATION_006] and N orth America suggesting common etiological factors, but the rate of growth is 
increasing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_218734] [2].  
The aetio -pathogenesis of CD is not fully understood but genetic and environment al factors 
interact to promote an excessive and poorly controlled mucosal inflammatory response 
against components of gut micro -flora. The excessive production of proinflammatory 
cytokines within mucosal and sub -mucosal tissues drives chronic inflammatory processes 
within the gut wall that are responsible for development of the disease immunopathology. 
Evidence from clinical studies with systemically delivered anti -tumour  necrosis factor alpha 
(TNFα ) antibodies has clearly established that blocking the biological effects of TNFα is 
beneficial in the treatment of CD and has confirmed the central importance of this master 
proinflammatory cytokine as a mediator of disease pathogenesis.  
If disease co ntrol is inadequate, the chronic inflammation leads to significant inflammatory, 
infectious and structural complications. The complications result in an increased need for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218735], impaired quality of life , and disease -related mortality . For 
example , in CD approximately half of all patients will experience an intestinal complication 
within 20 years, often leading to the need for surgical intervention [3]. Moreover, persistent 
and extensive int estinal inflammation increases the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_218736] [4].  
The traditional goal of treatment in IBD is to first induce, and then to maintain, clinical 
remission. Therapeutic  decisions tend to be driven by [CONTACT_218767]-term sequelae [5, 6]. 
The goal for therapy has thus shifted to include achieving healing of the gut mucosa with a 
view to reducing disability and bowel damage. The conventional strategy adopted for 
treatment  (stepwise, sequential introduction of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_218737] ) is being 
challenged because it is associated with lower efficacy, disease progress ion, a potentially 
higher risk of infections and, in moderate to severe disease, increased mortality. The use of 
VHsquared Ltd   16 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
[ADDRESS_262878] accumulated to support the case for 
earlier intervention with these systemic TNFα biologics. O bservational, subgroup analyses 
and randomised control trial data, both in adults and in paediatric populations, indicate that 
TNFα antagonists are much more effective when given to patients within 1 to 2 years of 
initial diagnosis and that early intervent ion prior to prolonged steroid administration 
improves clinical outcomes [6, 7, 8].  
Therefore, t he goal of therapy has expanded  from just the control of symptoms to include the 
prevention of disease . Further, the  indications are that the earlier a potent, safe, disease 
modifying TNFα antagonist therapy can be provided to patients, the better the outcomes. 
However, the only biological agents to date that have been shown to be capable of achieving 
this goal are severely restricted to patients who have either failed  or not responded to 
conventional therapy. Only a minority of patients  with CD currently receive systemic 
anti-TNF α therapy  and they are generally used as second or third line agents. Two major 
barriers to expanded use across a wider spectrum of patients with CD are cost and safety 
concerns. In addition, immunogenicity is a major issue that affects  the durability of r esponse 
seen with systemic anti -TNFα biologics . This may result  in both primary and secondary loss 
of response and lead to cycling between different products.  
VHsquared Ltd. (hereinafter, the “Sponsor”) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_218738], protease 
stabilised, engineered domain antibody against TNFα that may deliver significant advantages 
over current systemically administered anti -TNFα agents. The enhanced safety profile 
provided by [CONTACT_218768] -TNFα 
therapy to a wider spectrum of patients. It may allow earlier intervention in the disease 
course , thus potentially maximising the clinical benefit of TNFα inhibit ion. The minimal 
systemic exposure would promote use in paediatrics and pregnancy, areas where parenteral 
administration and lack of a safe potent oral formulation are currently problematic.  
The multi -particulate V565 oral formulation planned for further clinical use has bee n 
evaluated in a toxicology programme with dosing up to six weeks, and a Phase [ADDRESS_262879] s with dosing up to 14 days. Results from 
these studies support further investigation of V565 as a potential therapy for CD. 
The Phase 1 study was conducted in four parts:  
VHsquared Ltd   17 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  In Part 1 (n=29) 19 healthy volunteers received a single dose of V565 at a dose of either 
62 mg (n=4), 185  mg (n=4), 555  mg (n=3), 1665  mg (n=4), 4995  mg (n=4), or placebo 
(n=10) in a conventional sing le ascending dose design.  
In Part 2 (n=10) eight healthy volunteers received multiple doses of V565 (1665 mg three 
times a day [ TID]) and two received placebo TID for 14 days. The objectives were to assess 
safety and tolerability of multiple doses of V565,  and to investigate potential immunogenicity 
following multiple dosing.  
In Part 3 (n=4) otherwise healthy subjects with a terminal ileostomy received a single dose of 
V565 1665  mg to evaluate V565 luminal concentrations at the terminal ileum.  
Part 4 (n=6) was a single ascending dose study that investigated systemic exposure in 
subject s with mild to moderate CD. Two subject s received a single [ADDRESS_262880] method of assessing systemic exposure in case V565 was not detectable in serum 
samples.  
The results of the Phase 1 study are summari sed below : 
 V565 has been administered to 37 human subjects in single  doses up to 4995 mg 
and in multiple  doses up to 1665 mg TID for 14 days. V565 was safe and well 
tolerated. There were no deaths, no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no adverse 
events (AEs) leading to withdrawal or change of dose. Almost all AEs were mild, 
with the only severe AE being a re port of tonsillitis with initial symptoms starting 
approximately three hours after a 62 mg dose .   
 V565 was not detectable in any serum sample in any part of the study.  
 V565 was detected in the urine collection taken four to eight hours after dosing of 
one subject with CD  in Part 4, confirming that active V565 passes across the 
lamina propria.  
 No neutralising anti -drug antibodies were detected in any subject.  
 High concentrations of a ctive V565 were detected in ileal fluid and faeces .  
Additional non -clinic al information is provided in the current version of the V565 
Investigator's Brochure (IB) .  
2.2 Rationale  
There is a medical  need for a targeted anti -TNF α therapy that would minimise systemic 
exposure  (and the side effects associated with systemic exposure) , while providing effective 
treatment to the affected portions of the GI tract. Data from the Phase [ADDRESS_262881] that , 
relative to other anti -TNF α products  (which are given parentera lly and result in systemic 
VHsquared Ltd   18 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  exposure), orally administered V565 results in a very low level of systemic exposure . 
Therefore,  V565 may be expected to have a better s afety profile  than other anti -TNFα 
products . In addition, or ally administered V565 provides a more convenient route of 
administration  than the parenteral  route  used for other anti -TNFα  products . This proof -of-
concept Phase  2 study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and 
immunogenicity in subjects who receive V565 in combination with  any ongoing , permitted  
background treatment for CD. Permitted background treatments (those that will not interfere 
with the evaluation of the efficacy of V565) are described  in Section  5.10.2 . 
2.3 Hypothesis  
The hypothesis of this study is that  the proportion  of subjects at Day 42  achieving both  
 Crohn’s Disease  Activity Index [CDAI] ≥70 -point reduction from Baseline  OR a 
CDAI score <150  
AND  
 A reduction of ≥40% from baseline value of C-reactive protein [ CRP ] or faecal 
calprotectin [FCP] )  
will be higher in subjects who receive V565 than in subjects who receive p lacebo when used 
in combination with  their permitted  background CD medications.  
2.4 Risk Assessment  and Management of Risk  
2.4.1 Potential Risks Associated with V565  
The safety profile of parenteral anti-TNFα therapy is well-established  [9]. Because of the low 
level of systemic exposure associated with V565, it is anticipated that the potential adverse 
effects of anti-TNFα therapy will be minim ised.  
V565 was not associated with any treatment -related adverse effects in non -clinical toxicology 
studies . V565 was safe and well t olerated in the Phase [ADDRESS_262882] AEs were mild .  
Based on the mode of action of anti -TNFα therapy there may be an increased risk of GI and 
other  infections . This risk is being mitigated  by [CONTACT_42792] a high risk of 
infections (such as those with tuberculosis [TB], infection with GI pathogen s, current 
infection, or history of recurrent infections). During the study, subject s will be closely 
monitored for the occurrence of GI and other infections.  
No reproductive toxicity studies have been carried out to date . While there is post -marketing 
data on the outcome of pregnancies in women taking TNFα inhibitors, women of 
childbearing potential must not enter this study if they are pregnant or breastfeeding, and both 
male and female study subjects must take adequate pr ecautions to prevent pregnancy.

[ADDRESS_262883] Level 
(NOAEL) is defined as at least 75 mg/kg/da y when administered by [CONTACT_33980] ( IV) 
infusion  to monkeys for 6 weeks . This resulted in a maximum concentration ( Cmax) of 317 
µg/mL  after [ADDRESS_262884] has had a serum concentration above the lower limit of 
quantification  (62.5  ng/mL) at any dose administered.  
In the unlikely event of overdose,  it is recommended that supportive  measures are taken and 
further doses are withheld .  
2.4.2 2.3.1 Potential Risks Associated with Underlying Disease and  Study Design  
Lack of Efficacy : The subjects in this study will remain on their allowed  background therapy 
for the treatment of CD. Therefore, using V565 or placebo as an “add -on” therapy to the 
subject’s pre -existing CD treatment regimen  provides the subject with their minimal therapy.  
A rescue strategy has not been implemented because the study is only [ADDRESS_262885] the expected efficacy; however, the 
relatively short duration of treatment ( six weeks) minimi ses the amount of time the subject 
might be at risk of treatment with an ineffective study drug . All subjects will be closely 
monitored during the study . If a subject’s condition  worsens, and/or they require prohibited 
medications for the contr ol of CD, they will be withdrawn from the study  and treated as 
considered appropriate by [CONTACT_9682] . Finally, the study excludes individuals who have 
failed to respond to anti -TNF α therapy  in the past  and who therefore might be a t risk of 
failing to respond to  oral V565 .  
Study -related Procedures : The procedures  used in this study are consistent with those used in 
the evaluation of CD as part of the Committee for Medicinal Products  for Human Use 
(CHMP ) guideline  [10]. While ileocolonoscopy is an invasive procedure , it is routinely 
conducted in patients with CD to inform decision making for the appropriate therapy for the 
patient . The risk s associated with all procedures will be explained to subject s as part of the 
informed consent process .  
2.4.3 2.3.2 Risk -benefit  Analysis  
Crohn’s disease is a serious, progressive,  and lifelong disease for whi ch there is an unmet 
medical  need for effective therapy . Anti-TNFα therapi[INVESTIGATOR_218739], but they are given by [CONTACT_218769] . 
Therefore, treatment with these products  results  in systemic suppression of the activity of 
TNFα throughout the b ody for prolonged periods .  
VHsquared Ltd   20 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
[ADDRESS_262886] . However, there is the expectation that subjects treated with V565 will 
exper ience improvements in the symptoms of their underlying disease .  
In summary, the assessment of potential risks associated with V565 in non -clinical  and 
clinical studies conducted to date support further evaluation in humans.  
This study will be performed in  compliance with the protocol, International Council for  
Harmonisation ( ICH), Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and applicable regulatory requirements.

Section  4.4.  
The duration of treatment will be 42 days (six weeks); each subject’s participation in the 
study will be approximately [ADDRESS_262892] dose of study 
drug.  
Subjects will be randomised into two treatment arms : either V565 or placebo using a 2:1 
active:placebo ratio. Randomisation will be stratified to ensure treatment groups have similar 
rates of prior anti -TNFα t herapy.   
Subjects will receive three V565 185 mg capsules three times daily or matching placebo , for 
42 days (six weeks). The total daily V565 dose is 1665 mg.  
Subjects will be treated with study drug as an add -on to any permitted stable medications 
alread y being taken for CD. Permitted CD medications are described in Section 5.10.2 . No 
alteration of background CD medication will be permitted for the duration of the study.   
There are six study visits . Two screeni ng visits to assess  eligibility will occur during Days -
28 to Day -1; these are Visit 1 (start of screening), and Visit 2 ( eligibility ileocolonoscopy ). 
Additional study visits will occur on Day 1 (randomisation and initiation of treatment), Day 
14 (Interi m Visit), Day 42 (End of Treatment  Visit ), and Day 56 (Follow up  Visit ). 
Collection of subject -reported variables of the CDAI will be via the diaries given to subjects 
at Visit 1. Prior to Visit 2, the subject -reported variables will be combined with the v ariables 
collected at the site on Visit [ADDRESS_262893] sufficient diary entries to calculate a CDAI

and to be randomi sed on Day 1.  
The efficacy of V565 will be evaluated throughout the study by [CONTACT_218772] (CRP or FCP). Efficacy will also be evaluated 
with the PRO -2.  
Exploratory efficacy measures include changes in CDAI score s, changes in CRP (or FCP) 
values over time, the frequency of loose or watery stools as measured by [CONTACT_218760], the 
degree of abdominal pain as measured by [CONTACT_218757] , and changes in faecal urgency . This study 
will also assess the immunogenicity of V565 .  
In an  exploratory endoscopy substudy, subjects with more severe disease at the Visit 2 
ileocolonoscopy (a SES -CD ≥7, if ileum and colon are involved or ≥4 if only the ileum is 
involved ) will undergo a second ileocolonoscopy at the end of treatment (Day 42)  to evaluate 
changes in mucosal appearance . 
The PK evaluations will be based on V565 concentrations measured in serum and urine to 
evaluate systemic exposure (serum) and determine the levels of active V565 in urine samples.  
Safety will be assessed through evalu ations of AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs , 
physical examinations, ECGs  and concomitant medications .

4.2.1 Screening: Visit 1 and Visit 2 ( Ileocolonoscopy ) (Day -28 to Day -1) 
The subjects will be screened during the [ADDRESS_262902] sufficient diary entries to 
calculate a CDAI score, a CDAI score ≥220 to ≤450 and a CRP ≥5 mg/L (or if CRP is 
normal, FCP ≥250 µg/g) prior to Visit 2.  
When it is determined that the subject is eligible for the Visit [ADDRESS_262903] value(s) will supersede the original values for the evaluation of 
the subject’s eligibility.  
If a subject cannot be declared eligible within the 28-day screening  period  and the 
Investigator  wishes to re -screen the subject , the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_218773]’s 
Medical Advisor for permission to re-screen . Requests for re -screening will be handled on a 
case-by-case basis. A re -screening can be allowed once only  for an individual subject , 
regardless o f the reason . The subject will be allocated a new screening number.  
4.2.[ADDRESS_262904] will attend three site visits  (Day  1, Day 14 and 
Day 42). If possible, site visits will be scheduled for the morning . The window  for the Day 14 
and Day 42 visits is -3 days to +[ADDRESS_262905] been met (including those 
based on the r esults of the ileocolonoscopy), the subject will be  randomised. If not, the

 Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of two oral regimens: V5 65 555  
mg TID or placebo .  
The Day 1 assessments and procedures presented in  will be completed prior to starting 
treatment with study drug.  Treatment will begin on Day 1  at the site and continue to Day 42.  
Additional information on dosing is available in Section  5.8. 
Subjects will continue to fill out their diaries daily throughout the treatment period . At each 
visit, site personnel will review the diaries and ass ess compliance with study drug 
administration and with the use of the diary .  
Pharmacokinetic samples (blood and urine) will be collected at each study visit . On Day 1, 
subjects will be asked to provide a pre -treatment sample and an additional sample [ADDRESS_262906] their second  
ileoc olonoscopy performed on Day 42.

 safety assessments as deemed necessary.  These assessments are not required for subjects who 
return to the site for administrative reasons  (e.g., to pi[INVESTIGATOR_218740]).  
4.[ADDRESS_262908] of V565 (555  mg TID 
for 6 weeks) will be compared to placebo . A double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, 
randomised design was chosen to minimise bias . Concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_218741] .  
The dose selected for  this clinical proof -of-concept study is based on the 
safety/tolerability/PK profile elicited from the previous non -clinical and Phase [ADDRESS_262909] greater GI 
permeability than that of healthy volunteers. Dose selection was therefore based not on 
systemic exposure, but on the requirement to use a feasible dose which would be expec ted to 
deliver potentially therapeutically useful concentrations and which is not associated with 
adverse findings. Preclinical modelling has predicted that a dose around 500 mg TID would 
provide the required luminal concentration of V565 to provide potent ial benefit in CD. In 
addition, 555  mg delivered suitable faecal concentrations of V565 in both healthy volunteers 
and subjects with CD in the Phase 1 study , and did not present adverse safety or tolerability 
findings. Therefore, the proposed dose for clin ical testing is 555 mg TID, a total daily dose of 
1665 mg.  
The primary endpoint is based on changes in  CDAI score  and CRP (or FCP) biomarkers . The 
CDAI is well established as a standard scale for the evaluation of clinical outcome in CD. 
Published data do not explicitly clarify the relevant reduction in CRP associated with a 
clinical response in CD . However, in  2012,  Reinisch reported that the mean % reduction from 
baseline CRP associated with maintenance of a clinical response was 40% [11]. In this proof 
of concept study , a 40% reduction from Baseline has therefore been defined as a CRP 
response. The same definition will be applied to reduction in FCP. While a number of studies 
use normalisation of CRP as a crite rion, given the wide range of potential elevated CRP 
values in active CD patients this results in an unrealistically high hurdle for “relevant 
improvement” for inclusion in the primary endpoint in those patients with higher baseline 
values. Normalisation o f CRP will, however, be investigated as an exploratory endpoint in 
this study.  
The 6-week treatment period is considered sufficient to evaluate clinical efficacy  in this 
proof -of-concept study . The CHMP guidelines for new products for the treatment of CD 
describe  4 to 8 weeks of therapy as sufficient for the evaluation of CD  [10].

 5.0 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatments Administered  
The subjects in this study will receive either V565 ( three 185 -mg capsule s for a dose of 
555 mg TID, for a total daily dose of 1665 mg ) or an equal number of matching placebo 
capsules (TID) for 42 days ( six weeks ).  
5.[ADDRESS_262922](s)  
V565 is a 115 amino acid 12.6 kDa single domain variable heavy chain antib ody ( VHH), 
active against human TNFα. The antibody is manufactured in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .  
The drug substance is formulated into 3 mm round mini -tablets . The mini -tablets are coated 
with a polymer s ub-coat and a Eudragit® enteric coat is applied to e ngender release in the 
required area of the GI tract. Once coated, the mini -tablets are encapsulated in  hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose ( HPMC ) capsules .  
The formulation is engineered to release the mini -tablets from the capsules in the stomach . 
The size of the mini -tablets enables them to escape through the pylorus and migrate through 
the GI tract . The mini -tablet coating releases active molecule at a pH designed to ensure 
delivery of high concentrations of V565 to the ileum and distal parts of the GI tract.  
The components of the V565 drug product  are presented in Table 1.  
There is one dose strength for V565 active capsules. The V565 dose per capsule is 185 mg. 
Each 185 mg Size 00 pi[INVESTIGATOR_218744] 15  mini-tablets. Placebo HPMC 
capsules are identical to capsules containing V565  and contain  an equivalent number of 
mini-tablets of identical si ze, shape, and colour. The placebo mini-tablets are made of the 
same components as in Table 1 but contain no active V565.

prior to Visit [ADDRESS_262931] the study . 
Subjects will return to the care of their personal physician .  
5.12 Treatment Compliance  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that subject s are instructed in the proper  use of 
study drug and that the subjects are fully compliant with their assigned dosage regimen , as 
well as the timing for taking the study d rug relative  to meals  (see Section  5.8). 
The prescribed dosage, timing, and mode of study drug administration may not be changed . 
Any departures from the intended regimen must be recorded in the eCRF .  
At Day 14  and Day 42 , previously dispensed study drug  will be retrieved by [CONTACT_218784] . Subjects will be asked to return all unused medication at  each visit.   
Adequate compliance is defined as taking between 80% and 120% of dispensed st udy drug. 
Compliance problems (e.g., missing 2 or more consecutive full days [at least 6 doses] or 
taking less than 80% or more than 120% of the doses between study visits) should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor to determine if the subject may contin ue in the study.

All study drug  supplies should be accounted for at the termination of the study and a written 
explanation provided for discrepancies . All unused study drug  supplies and packaging 
materials are to be inventorie d and returned by [CONTACT_218785] . 
The study drug may be destroyed at the site with the consent of the Sponsor.

[ADDRESS_262933] ete the diary daily  throughout 
the study until Day 42 (the End of Treatment Visit). The diary will be used to record the 
subject -reported variables of the CDAI, the BSFS, and the NPS.  
Site personnel will assess the subject’s compliance with the use of the  diary throughout the 
study.  
During the screening period , subjects must have entered sufficient diary data to allow 
calculation of the CDAI score  (see Section 6.1.2 ). Subjects with poor compliance completing  
the diary during screening will be considered screen failures. Subjects with poor compliance 
completing the diary during the treatment period may be withdrawn from the study . 
The data obtained from the subject diary will be  used for calculation of the subject-reported 
variables  of the CDAI  and other efficacy outcomes measures  such as the PRO -2, BSFS and 
NPS.  
The subject will record the following information in the subject diary to assess CD activity : 
1. Number of liquid or very soft stools  
2. Abdominal pain/cra mps 
3. General well -being  
4. Fever over 100°F (37.8°C)  
5. Use of anti-diarrhea l drugs  (e.g., loperamide, diphenoxylate, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_858])  
6.1.2 Crohn’s Disease Activity Index   
Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is the most commonly used measure of clinical 
activity in patients with CD  [12, 13, 14]. Some of the data used to calculate the CDAI is 
obtained from the subject diary (see Section  6.1.1 ) and some is obtained at site visits. The 
CDAI will be calculated  at the time points identified in . 
The CDAI consists of eight  variables:  
1.  Total number of li quid or very soft stools (total for previous 7 days)  
2. Abdominal pain/cramps rating (total for previous 7 days)  
VHsquared Ltd   43 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 3. Subjective g eneral well -being rating (total for previous 7 days)  
4. Total number of listed categories the subject has experienced during the last 7 d ays 
(Note: all of these are assessed by [CONTACT_218786], which  
is obtained from the subject diary .) 
a. Arthritis or arthralgias  
b. Iritis/uveitis, erythema nodosum, or pyoderma gangrenosum  
c. Aphthous ulcers  
d. Anal fissures, fistulae, or  abscess  
e. Other fistula (specified by [CONTACT_8786])  
f. Fever higher than 100°F or 37.8°C during previous week  
5. Use of anti -diarrheal drugs (e.g., loperamide, diphenoxylate, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_858])  
6. Presence of a bdominal mass  
7. Anaemia  based on haematocrit  (HCT)  value ent ered into formula:  
a. For men = 47 – HCT  value  
b. For women = 42 – HCT  value  
8. Body weight in kilograms (kg) entered into formula:  
a. ([standard weight in kg – actual weight kg] / [standard weight in kg]) x 100%  
The responses are scored numerically and weighted . Total CDAI scores range from 
0 to approximately 600 points ; a higher score indicates a more active disease . A CDAI score 
of <150 points denotes remission, a score between 150 to 219 points denotes mildly active 
disease, a score of  ≥220 to ≤450 points denotes m oderately active disease, and a score of 
>[ADDRESS_262934] CDAI data until the Early Termination  Visit. 
Instructions for recording the CDAI score will be given at Visit 1  (see Section  6.1.1 ). Data 
should be reviewed at each study visit, including unscheduled visits.  
A sample of a CDAI score worksheet  is provided in the Appendi x (Section  12.1) 
6.1.3 Biomarkers of Inflammation  
The collection of CRP and/or FCP will occur at the time points indicated in . 
C-reactive protein is an acute -phase rea ctant produced in the liver and is an easily measured 
non-specific marker of inflammation . It is a widely used marker of inflammation in CD and 
elevations in CRP have been associated with endoscopic inflammation in CD [15, 16]. 
VHsquared Ltd   44 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
[ADDRESS_262935] if CRP results are 
<5 mg/L. D uring the treatment and follow up phase of the study, FCP will only be evaluated 
in subjects whose screening CRP was <5  mg/L, and who qualified for the study based on 
their screening FCP value.  
Calprotectin is abundant in the cytosol of activated neutrophi ls. The amount of FCP is 
directly proportional to neutrophil influx into the intestinal tract and is a reliable non -specific 
marker of intestinal inflammation [ 17, 18, 19]. While currently endoscopy with biopsy is 
considered the gold standard for evaluating the extent and location of inflammatory mucosal 
lesions, studies have shown that FCP may also be a useful marker of int estinal inflammation.  
On Day 1, the faecal  sample for FCP should be collected prior to administration of the first 
dose of study drug . The subject may also provide a sample from faeces  passed one day prior 
to the scheduled visits . These samples will be co llected in sterile containers  (to be provided to 
the subjects ) and refrigerated  at home . At each sampling time point, approximately 2  g to 5  g 
of faeces will be collected .  
6.1.4 Abdominal Pain and Stool Frequency Instrument (PRO -2) 
PRO -2 will be calculated at t he time points indicated in . 
The PRO -2 is a composite score that measures abdominal pain and soft stool frequency 
averaged over seven days [ 20]. The data for the  total PRO -[ADDRESS_262936] diary . These data are the 
entries for the number of liquid or soft stools/day and abdominal pain (rated on a scale of 0 -3) 
assessed over the course  of seven  days.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_262937] CDA I scores ≥220 to ≤450  and CRP level ≥5  mg/L [or if 
CRP is normal, FCP level ≥250  µg/g] ). The timing of the Visit [ADDRESS_262938] as to enable evaluation by [CONTACT_218787] r.  
Video images of all endoscopic procedures will be captured and sent to a qualified central 
reader .  
The images will be examined to determine the central reader’s overall impression of the state 
of mucosa  to assess eligibility for randomi sation and to c alculate the SES-CD (see 
VHsquared Ltd   45 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 Section  6.1.6 ). Active disease must be confirmed by [CONTACT_218788] 3 and randomisation  on Day 1 .  
6.1.6 SES-CD 
The SES -CD assesses the mucosal appearance of the intestine in subjects with CD [21]. It 
includes four variables: ulcer size, the extent of ulcerated surface, extent of affected surface, 
and stenosis .   
Each of these four components are assess ed in the five segments of the ileum and colon: 
ileum, right  colon , transverse  colon , left colon (descending and sigmoid), and rectum . The 
SES-CD is the sum of the individual scores of each of the components across the five 
segments . For the SES-CD, a high er score i ndicates  more severe disease.  
In addition  to obtaining baseline information  on the condition of the mucosa , changes in 
overall mucosal appearance and changes in the SES-CD in response to treatment will be 
evaluated in an exploratory endoscopy substudy . This substudy will include subjects with a 
baseline SES -CD  ≥7 (if ileum and colon are involved) or ≥4 (if the lesions are confined to 
the ileum ). These subjects will have an additional ileocolonoscopy  at Day 42 .  
6.1.7 Exploratory Efficacy Measures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bristol Stool Form Scale  
The BS FS [22, 23] is used to monitor change in intestinal function and transit time, by 
[CONTACT_218789] 7  categories : 
 Type 1 : Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)  
 Type 2: Sausage -shaped, but lumpy  
 Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface  
 Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft  
 Type 5: Soft blobs with clear -cut edges (passed easily)  
 Type 6: Fl uffy pi[INVESTIGATOR_6927], a mushy stool  
 Type 7: Watery, no solid pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928] , entirely liquid  
This scale will be included  in the subject diary and will be completed  daily . The Bristol Stool 
Chart  is included in the Appendix ( Section  12.2).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Numeric Pain Scale  
Abdominal pain will be evaluated with an [ADDRESS_262939] 
pain imaginable [24, 25].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Faecal Urgency  
The degree of faecal urgency will be evaluated by [CONTACT_218790] 24 hours prior the site visits on  Day 1  (Baseline) , Day 14 and Day  42. 
Faecal urgency evaluates the subjects need to ru sh to the toilet for a bowel movement.  Faecal 
urgency will be scored using the following scale:  
 0 = No urgency  
 1 = Mild urgency  
 2 = Moderate urgency  
 3 = Severe urgency  
 4 = Very severe urgency/didn’t make it to toilet on time  
If the subject had more than one bowel movement in the [ADDRESS_262941] urgency will be recorded.  
6.2 Safety  Assessments  
Safety will be monitored during the study as detailed in . Safety variables include evaluations 
of AEs, laboratory evaluations, vital signs, physical examinations , ECGs  and concomitant 
medications .  
6.2.1 Adverse Events   
Definition of AE : An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  enrolled in this 
study (i.e., that occurs aft er the informed consent form [ ICF] is signed), regardless of its 
causal relationship to study drug.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable  and unintended sign (including a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease.  
An AE inc ludes a/an:  
 Exacerbation of a pre -existing condition or disease.  
 Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing condition.  
 Continuous persistent pre -existing disease or symptoms that worsen after the 
subject provides informed consent.  
If a clinically  significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal test result meets the 
definition of an AE or SAE, then the AE eCRF page or SAE eCRF page must be completed, 
as appropriate . Clinically  significant laboratory results include those that:  
 Result in d iscontinuation from the study.  
VHsquared Ltd   47 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
  Require treatment or any other therapeutic intervention.  
 Require further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same 
procedure to confirm the abnormality).  
 Are associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged b y the Investigator to have 
a clinically significant impact.  
A diagnosis (if known), or clinical signs and symptoms (if diagnosis is unknown), rather than 
the clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or test result, should be entered on the 
AE or SAE eCRF page . If no diagnosis is known and clinical signs and symptoms are not 
present, then the clinically significant abnormal finding should be recorded  as an AE . 
An AE does not include a/an:  
 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, too th extraction, 
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE . Any complication 
of the procedure is also considered to be an AE. 
 Pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that 
do not worsen.  
 Situatio ns where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218746], social and/or convenience 
admissions).  
 The disease or disorder being studied or sign or symptom associated with the 
disease or disorder, unless more severe or frequent than expected for the subject’s 
condition.  
Any medical condition that is present prior to informed consent should be recorded as 
medical history and not be reported as an AE . 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event : A TEAE is defined as  
1. A new event that occurs during or after treatment with study drug or  
2. Any event present at Baseline  that worsens in either intensity or frequency after 
exposure to study drug .  
Definition of Serious Adverse Event :  
An SAE, experience or reaction, is any unt oward medical occurrence (whether considered to 
be related to study drug or not) , that, at any dose:  
 Results in death  – the death was an outcome of an AE. 
 Is life -threatening (the subject  is at a risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to  an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe) . 
 Requires in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218747]: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations planned before or during a study 
VHsquared Ltd   48 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
[ADDRESS_262942] 
during the study . 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , i.e., the AE resulted in a 
substa ntial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., 
the AE resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment , 
damage or disruption in the subject’s body function/structure, physical activities 
and/or quality o f life   
 Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect  in the offspring of a subject who received 
drug – it is suspected that exposure to study drug prior to conception or during 
pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in the child . 
 Other:  Medically s ignificant events, which do not meet any of the criteria above, 
but may jeopardi se the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcome s listed in the definition above . Examples 
of such events are blood d yscrasias ( e.g., neutropenia or anaemia  requiring blood 
transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73256].  
Other Adverse Event Definitions : 
An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is defined as all noxious and unintended responses to a 
medicin al product related to any dose .  
An Unexpected ADR  is defined as any adverse reaction, the nature of which is not consistent 
with the  applicable product information and is unexpected . An adverse reaction is 
‘unexpected’ if its nature and severity are not c onsistent with the information about the 
medicinal product in question set out in Section 7 of the  IB.  
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is an adverse reaction, the 
nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable pr oduct information (e.g., for 
applicable product information, include the IB for an unapproved investigational product or 
the package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product) . Therefore, if 
a treatment -related SAE occurs and it was  not mentioned in the applicable product 
information, then it will be reported as a S[LOCATION_003]R .  
Definitions of Severity  
The severity of the AE will be characteri sed as “mild, moderate or severe” according to the 
following definitions:  
 Mild  events are usually t ransient and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities.  
 Moderate  events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject 
and may interfere with daily activities.  
 Severe  events interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity.

Drug Name: V565  
[ADDRESS_262943] be assessed by [CONTACT_218791]:  
‘Is there a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event?’  
Yes There is a reasonable or strong temporal relationship, and the events ar e unlikely 
attributed to other drugs, underlying diseases or other factors.  
No There is no st rong temporal relationship, and /or use of other drugs, underlying 
diseases, or other factors provide plausible explanations for the occurrence of the 
event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Monito ring of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording all AEs observed during the study ( screening , 
treatment, and follow -up period s). At each visit, the subject will be asked if they have 
experienced any untoward occurrence since the last t rial visit . In addition, subjects will be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_218792].  
All AEs/SAEs should be recorded individually in the study subject’s own words (verbatim) 
unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] t he Investigator, the AEs/SAEs constitute components of a 
recogni sed condition, disease, or symptom . The Investigator should attempt to establish a 
diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information . In such 
cases, the diagno sis should be documented as the AE and/or SAE rather than the individual 
signs/symptoms.  
All AEs will be recorded on the eCRFs and include a description of the event, severity, tim e 
of occurrence, and duration . In addition, any action (e.g ., treatment and follow -up tests) and 
the outcome should be provided along with the Investigator’s assessment of the relationship 
to the investigational drug.  
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure 
is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  
In cases in which the subject dies, the cause of death should be recorded as an SAE; death is 
considered the outcome of the SAE .  
Adverse events should be followed until recovery to the normal state has been achieve d. In 
the event of a subject not returning to the study site, the outcome of this event will be 
recorded as unknown . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs  that occur after the subject has signed consent ( regardless of severity and /or 
perceived relationship t o study drug) are to be recorded on the appropriate AE sections  (either

 ‘serious’ or ‘non -serious’) in the eCRF . Spontaneously reported SAEs that occur for up to [ADDRESS_262944] ete 
all the details requested including dates of onset, severity, action taken , outcome , relationship 
to study drug. Each event should be recorded separately.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
In the case of a n SAE  (including S[LOCATION_003]Rs ), the Investigator  must complete, sign and date the 
SAE pages from the eCRF , and check that the data are consistent .  
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs during this study, whether or not 
related to the study drug, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the study site’s 
knowledge of the event) by [CONTACT_5583] a completed, separate SAE Report Form by [CONTACT_218793]: : 
Contact [CONTACT_218794] +44(0)1462 600 456  
Email  drug.safe [EMAIL_4274]  
The report will contain all available information concerning the SAE to enable the Sponsor 
(or an authori sed representative) to file a report, which satisfies regulatory reporting 
requirements . These timelines apply to initial reports o f SAEs and to all follow -up reports .  
All SAEs will be recorded on the SAE Report Form, the Adverse Events Form in the eCRF , 
and source documents . Criteria for documenting the relationship to study drug as well as 
severity and outcome will be the same as t hose previously described .  
SAEs considered causally related to study treatment that are spontaneously reported to the 
Investigator more than [ADDRESS_262945]’s last dose of study drug should also be 
collected and reported as described previously, r egardless of the time after the trial.  
The information must include at least the following:  
 Name, address,  and telephone number of the reporting Investigator  
 Invest igational product and study cod e. 
 Subject  identification number, sex, and date of birth  (recorded as permitted by 
[CONTACT_50844] ). 
 Description of the AE, measures taken and outcome . 
 Preliminary classification of causal relationship by [CONTACT_218795] -up information should be completed on an SAE Form with a copy sent to 
Emas Pharma and the original included in the SAE section of the eCRF.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and 
Investigator s 
Investigators will be notified of all SAEs that require prompt submission to their Institutional 
Review Bo ard (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). Investigators should provide 
written documentation of IRB/IEC notification for each report to the Sponsor or Quintiles. 
Emas Pharma will ensure that all applicable SAEs are reported to the appropriate regula tory 
authorities on behalf of the Sponsor . In countries where the sponsor is responsible for IEC 
submissions of applicable SAEs,  this will be performed by [CONTACT_218796].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
Any AEs observed from Screening /randomi sation up to the final study visit  will be followed 
up to resolution . Resolution means that the subject  has returned to a baseline state of health or 
the Investigator  does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
Females of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test performed at Screening  
and a urine pregnancy test at Day [ADDRESS_262946] for pregnancy at Day 42 
(the end of the study ) and at Day 56 ( the Follow -up Visit ). In addi tion, a pregnancy test will 
be performed at the Early Termination Visit, if a female of childbearing potential 
discontinues the study prior to Day 42 .  
Any known or suspected pregnancy that occurs during the study (either in female subjects or 
female part ners of male subjects) must be reported to Emas Pharma within [ADDRESS_262947]. Pregnant females 
will be discontinued from the study.  
The Sponsor /designee  has a responsibility to monitor the outcome of all pregnancies reported 
during the study. The Investigator must follow up and document the course and the outcome 
of all pregnancies even if the subject  withdraws consent or the study has finished.  
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_218748] a suspected AE is 
associated with pregnancy.  
Elective abortions without complications should not be regarded as AEs, unless they were 
therapeutic abortions (see below) . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218749] a healthy new-born 
should not be considered an SAE.

[ADDRESS_262948] be reporte d by [CONTACT_218797] 30 days after he/she has gained knowledge of the 
normal delivery or elective abortion . The Investigator must follow up and document the 
course and the outcome of all pregnanci es even if the subject was withdrawn from the study 
or if the study has finished . The pregnancy  will be followed up to delivery; the Investigator 
must report any complications that occur even though the study has finished.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregna ncy must be recorded on the SAE Report Form 
(e.g.,  maternal serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within 24 hours in accordance 
with the procedure for repo rting SAEs  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
6.2.[ADDRESS_262949] be willing to use effective 
contraception from signing informed consent  and for 90 days after the study .  
1. Females of childbearing potential  include any female who has experienced menarche 
and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilisation (hysterectomy, bilateral 
tubal ligation, salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. 
Postmenopausal is defined as no menses for ≥12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. Females with questionable menopausal history (e.g., irregular 
menstrual periods and age >40 years) are considered to be of childbearing potential.  
2. Females of childbearing potential  must use acceptable highl y effective (according to 
Clinical Trial Facilitation Group [CTFG] recommendations)  methods of birth control 
in this study . These include :  
 Combined ( oestrogen  and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associat ed with inhibition of ovulation  
o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associat ed with inhibition of ovulation  
o oral 
o injectable

 o implantable  
 Intrauterine device  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomised partner (provided that  partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
female of childbearing potential  trial participant and that the vasectomised partner 
has received medical assessment of the surgical success.)  
 Sexual abstinence must be true sexual abstinence defined as refraining  from 
heterosexual intercourse as part of the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject . 
This behavior must cover the entire period of risk associated with the study 
treatment , which includes at least the time of screening up to at least 90 days after 
the end of treatment . The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in 
relation to the duration of the study . Periodic abstinence ( e.g., calendar ovulation, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of e xposure to study drug , and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception . 
3. Fertile males  who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential 
must agree to use contraception (condom plus spermicide or partner using acceptable 
highly effective method) from signing informed consent and for [ADDRESS_262950] at each study vi sit. 
The clinical laboratory parameters used as screening tests , efficacy outcomes  or for safety 
monitoring are presented in Table 2. 
Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical sig nificance 
throughout the study  (see Section  6.2.1  for definition of clinically significant laboratory 
results) . If the Investigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it 
is conside red a laboratory AE . However, if possible, the underlying condition causing the 
laboratory abnormality, rather than the abnormality itself, should be reported as the AE . 
Clinically significant laboratory results will be followed to resolution or until the Investigator 
considers the abnormality chronic and/or the subject to be stable.

 7.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
According to the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95), the Sponsor is 
responsible for study drug documentation and maintaining quality assurance and quality 
control systems with written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) .  
Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handling .  
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data:  
 Investigator  meeting(s)  
 Central laboratories for clinical laboratory parameters  
 Site Initiation visit  
 Early site visits post -enrolment  
 Routine site monitoring  
 Ongoing site communication and training  
 Data management quality control checks  
 Conti nuous data acquisition and cleaning  
 Internal review of data  
 Quality control check of the final clinical study report  
In addition, the Sponsor and/or Quintiles Clinical Quality Assurance Department may 
conduct periodic audits of the study processes, includi ng, but not limited to study site, site 
visits, central laboratories, vendors, clinical database, and final clinical study report . When

During monitoring visits, entries in the eCRF s will be compared with the original source 
documents (source data verification) . 
7.2 Data Management/Coding  
Data generated within this clinical study  will be handle d accordi ng to the relevant SOPs of 
the Data M anagem ent and B iostatistics departments of Quintiles .  
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) will be used for this study , meaning that all eCRF  data will 
be entered in electronic form s at the study  site. Data collectio n will be completed by 
[CONTACT_218804] . Appropriate training and security 
measures will be completed with the Investigator  and all authori sed study site staff prior to 
the study being initiated and prior to any da ta being entered into the system for any study 
subjects.  
All data must be entered in English . The eCRF s should always reflect the latest observations 
on the subjects participating in the study . Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon 
as possible d uring or after the subject’s visit . To avoid inter -observer variability, every effort 
should be made to ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline 
determinations completes all efficacy and safety evaluations . The Investigator  must verify  
that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct . If some assessments are not done, 
or if certain information is not available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigator  
should indicate this in the eCRF . The Investigator  will be required to  sign off electronically 
on the clinical data .  
The monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency . The 
eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies 
between critical data . All e ntries, corrections,  and alterations are to be made by [CONTACT_218805]/her designee . The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs . 
Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the 
data fields wi ll be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name [CONTACT_218817], and the  time and date of the change will be logged . Roles and 
rights of the site staff responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will b e 
determined in advance . If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or Data 
Manager will raise a query in the EDC application . The appropriate study site staff will 
answer queries sent to the Investigator . This will be audit trailed by t he EDC application , 
meaning that the name [CONTACT_218818], time and date stamp are captured.  
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original 
(or source) medical records unless otherwise specified . Source  documents are all documents

[ADDRESS_262961]’s 
medical history, that verify the existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
and all records covering the subject’s  participation in the study . They include laboratory 
notes, ECG results, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, subject files, etc.  
The Investigator  is responsible for maintaining source documents . These will be made 
available for inspection by [CONTACT_216590] . The Investigator  must 
submit a completed eCRF for each subject who receives study drug , regardless of duration . 
All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2553], should be clearl y identified with the study and subject number . Any personal 
information, including subject name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve 
individual confidentiality.  
eCRF  records will be automatically appended with th e identification of the cre ator by [CONTACT_218806] . Specified records will be electronically signed by [CONTACT_218807]/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are accurate . This 
will be facilitated by [CONTACT_132158] ’s unique UserID and password; date and time 
stamps will be added automatically at time of electronic signature . If an entry on an eCRF 
requires change, the correction should be made in accordance with the relevant software 
procedures . All changes will be fully reco rded in a protected audit trail, and a reason for the 
change will be required.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA ). Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization 
(WHO ) Drug Dictionary and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) system . Concomitant

 8.0 STATISTICS  
8.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size is based on being able to claim su periority of V565 over placebo; the 
primary endpoint is defined as a response rate, based on CDAI reduction/remission and CRP  
or FCP results.  
It is assumed that the proportion of subjects assigned to placebo treatment who respond is 
0.15. A clinically imp ortant response rate on V565 is defined as 0.4.  
A 2:1 (V565:placebo) allocation, 80% power and 5% statistical significance rate estimate 
76:38 evaluable subjects will be required for this study. With a 10% estimated non -evaluable 
rate, a total of 126 subje cts (84:42) are planned to be randomised to treatment . 
Sample size estimates are based on a Pearson chi -square test for two proportions and are 
generated using SAS Power and Sample Size v13.2.   
A subgroup of subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_218809] s in overall mucosal 
appearance and changes in SES -CD. However, the study is not powered to show a difference 
in these  endpoint.  
8.2 Statistical Methods  
The default summary statistics for continuous variables include number of contributing 
observations [n], me an, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum , and maximum .  
For categorical variables, the number and percentage (the percentage of subjects in each 
category relative to the total number of subjects in the relevant analysis population or relative 
to the to tal number of subjects in the relevant analysis population, with assessments available 
[where appropriate]) in each category will be the default summary presentation.  
Unless otherwise specified, “Baseline” is defined as the last observed value of the para meter 
of interest prior to the first intake of study medication (this includes unscheduled visits). For 
numerical variables, change from Baseline  will be calculated as the difference between the 
value of interest and the corresponding baseline value.  
Unles s otherwise specified, all formal statistical tests will be two -sided at the 5% significance 
level. Point estimates of treatment differences will be accompanied with two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) where applicable .  
In the case of normality assum ption violation s, appropriate non -parametric methods  will be 
used for analysis .  
All data will be presented in by -subject listings . 
The statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® Version 9.2 or higher.  
VHsquared Ltd   63 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
[ADDRESS_262963] both CDAI ≥70 -point reduction from Baseline  or CDAI <150 , and a reduction of 
≥40% from the baseline value of CRP or FCP.  
The primary endpoint will be analy sed using a logistic regression model with treatment as the 
fixed effect and prior anti -TNF α therapy , baseline CDAI score, baseline CRP and baseline 
FCP values as covariates . For the active treatment versus placebo comparison, the results will 
be presented in terms of an odds ratio together with its associated 95% CI and 2 -sided p -
value.  Two-sided 95% CIs  for the odds ratio will be provided.  
Possible effects of any other covariates may also be investigated . Details of such analyses 
will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). Missing data handling and possible 
sensitivity analysis will be desc ribed in the SAP.  Details of specific alternative  statistical  
methods  in the event model assumptions are violated  will be documented in the SAP.  
8.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The secondary endpoints below  will be analy sed using the same model as used in the  primary 
endpoint analysis.  
 Proportion of subjects achieving a ≥100 -point reduction in CDAI score and a 
concomitant reduction of 50% in CRP or FCP at Day 42  
 Proportion of subjects achieving a ≥70 -point reduction in CDAI score at Day 42  
 Proportion of subjects achieving a ≥100 -point re duction in CDAI score at Day 42  
 Proportion of subjects achieving a CDAI score of <150 CDAI at Day 42  
For the PRO -2 score assessments, the changes in total scores from Baseline to Day 14 and 
Day 42 will be analysed using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures  (MMRM) with 
treatment as the fixed effect, prior anti -TNFα and baseline scores as covariates.  
8.2.3 Exploratory Analyses  
The exploratory endpoint evaluating the proportion of subjects achieving CRP (or FCP) 
levels within normal limits at Day 14 and Day 42 will be summarised using frequency and 
percentage .  
The endpoints evaluating changes in CDAI score over time and changes in CRP (or FCP ) 
results over time will be summarised using descriptive statistics.

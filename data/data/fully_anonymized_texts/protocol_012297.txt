Revised 6-2016  3	2.	Purpose	of	the	Study (See Initial Review Guidelines Section 2) 1 Literature Review:  2  3 Heavy drinking peaks during late adolescence and early adulthood and is especially common among 18 – 4 24 year-old young adults who attend college (Hingson et al., 2005). College students often drink large 5 quantities of alcohol over relatively brief time periods, which can result in dangerously high blood 6 alcohol concentrations (Fourneir et al., 2004).  These patterns of heavy drinking place college students 7 at high risk for alcohol-related health and social problems.  Hingson et al. (2005) estimated that alcohol [ADDRESS_153313]-year alcohol-related health and social problems, including having 10 unprotected sex, driving under the influence of alcohol, being injured due to drinking, being assaulted or 11 hit by a student who was drinking, and being the victim of sexual assault or date rape (Hingson et al., 12 2005).  Heavy drinking can also impede critical developmental tasks such as educational attainment and 13 career development (Bachman et al., 1997), which may in turn increase risk for substance abuse and 14 other problematic outcomes during adulthood (Bennette et al.,1999).  Heavy drinkers tend to enter 15 college with lower academic aptitude, are less engaged in academic activities during college, and finish 16 with lower grades than other students (Ham & Hope, 2003). 17  18 Growing recognition of these social and health problems has made the prevention and treatment of 19 college student alcohol abuse a significant research and public health priority (Ham & Hope, 2003).  [ADDRESS_153314] of young adults do not begin to drink heavily until they arrive at college 22 (Gledhill-Hoyt et al., 2000).  Most students begin drinking during their 1st year, which makes the initial [ADDRESS_153315] promising interventions for college student drinkers include personalized feedback about 26 drinking patterns, blood alcohol content (BAC), and alcohol-related risks along with advice to moderate 27 drinking (Dimeff et al., 1999; Larimer et al., 2004/2005).  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_135364] 28 advice are delivered in the context of a motivational interview (MI), a supportive and nonjudgmental 29 therapeutic approach that focuses on increasing motivation to change drinking (Miller & Rollnick, 2002). 30 The goals of these interventions are pragmatic and focused on reducing drinking and related 31 consequences.  For example, students are advised to limit their overall alcohol quantity and to space 32 their drinks out over several hours.  These brief motivational interventions (BMIs) result in drinking 33 reductions that exceed various control conditions (Murphy et al., 2001, 2004). [ADDRESS_153316] BMI trials with college students, Marlatt et al. (1998) identified 300 incoming 36 college students who were at risk for alcohol problems based on their reported levels of drinking in high 37 school and randomly assigned them to either an assessment-only control condition or a single-session 38 BMI (Marlatt et al., 1998).  Students who received a BMI showed significant reductions in drinking [ADDRESS_153317] drinks among treated participants, a mean 42 shift from risky “binge” drinking to more moderate and less harmful consumption levels.  These findings 43 were replicated by [CONTACT_135386] (2000), and other studies have found an advantage for BMIs 44 relative to active control conditions.  Murphy et al. (2001) found that, among the heavier drinkers in a 45 sample of undergraduates, an individual BMI intervention showed a significant advantage for reducing 46 total drinks per week and frequency of heavy drinking over a traditional educational intervention. 47 
Revised 6-2016  4	Several empi[INVESTIGATOR_135365] (e.g., contingency management, community 48 reinforcement, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_25125]) attempt to develop viable alternatives to substance use such 49 as recreational pursuits, exercise,  or increased engagement in career related activities (Petry et al., 50 2000). Recently, research in college student populations has demonstrated support for a behavioral 51 economic supplement to BMIs that addresses a previous limitation that these interventions do not 52 attempt to also increase positive activities that might substitute for alcohol and drug use (see Murphy et 53 al., 2012a). A pi[INVESTIGATOR_135366]-focused 54 BMI and Substance-Free Activity Session (SFAS) resulted in significantly greater reductions in alcohol 55 problems and binge drinking compared to an alcohol BMI + relaxation session control intervention 56 (Murphy et al., 2012a,b). Given the promising results of the in-person SFAS, the proposed project will 57 develop and evaluate a mobile-based (text-message) BMI + SFAS that attempts to increase students’ 58 participation in academic, community, and recreational activities while taking full advantage of the 59 technological advances many young adults already own and use (Anderson, 2015).  60  61 Possible Contribution: [ADDRESS_153318]-effective 65 and widespread dissemination.  66  67 Study Goals:  [ADDRESS_153319] will develop and empi[INVESTIGATOR_135367] a mobile-based alcohol brief intervention 69 and substance-free activity session. To do this, study personnel will develop and systematically evaluate 70 an intervention that includes efficacious elements of brief alcohol interventions along with personalized 71 feedback. Intervention elements will be delivered remotely via personalized web-based feedback and 72 text-messages.  We will evaluate the efficacy of the mobile-based brief alcohol intervention compared 73 to mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education in the context of a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. 74  75 3.	Methods	and	Procedures (See Initial Review Guidelines Section 3) 76 This research will be divided into two stages:  Stage 1, the screening stage, and Stage 2, the randomized 77 pi[INVESTIGATOR_135368].  During the screening stage, participants will be recruited and screened for eligibility to 78 participate in Stage 2.  During the randomized controlled trial stage (stage 2), we will test the feasibility 79 and efficacy of a mobile-based BMI + SFAS in the context of a two-group experimental design.  All 80 students (N = 100) will complete a baseline assessment and will then be randomly assigned to either 81 receive a mobile-based BMI + SFAS, or mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education. Each group will [ADDRESS_153320] (1 booster session per week) on material from their respective study 83 condition. Outcomes will be assessed after the fourth booster session and at a 3-month follow-up. 84 Procedures: 85 Screening to Identify Eligible Participants: 86 In order to identify enough eligible participants, we estimate that we will need to screen approximately 87 1000 college students (recruited through the University of Memphis psychology subject pool, emails 88 sent to undergraduate courses, classroom screeners, local and university publication advertisements, 89 and flyers around the University of Memphis campus and other local college campuses; see Appendix 90 for recruitment flyer/ad). Participants will complete a brief screening survey via classroom screeners, [ADDRESS_153321] information for interested respondants/participants to contact [CONTACT_135387] [ADDRESS_153322] month (4/5 97 or more drinks for women/men on one occasion) will be eligible to participate in this trial (eligibility 98 criteria listed in Section 7). We expect [ADDRESS_153323] about the 102 study.  Text messaging and email may also be used as methods to communicate with participants who 103 meet the eligibility criteria and will be used as the primary method of communication if the student 104 prefers. Participants will be informed that the study is designed to learn more about college students’ [ADDRESS_153324] information, and 113 complete the initial baseline assessment via a secure web-link.  114 All self-report measures will be completed by [CONTACT_135388] a secure, web-based survey. Prior to 115 completing baseline measures, participants will be provided with a consent form and will be informed of 116 the study’s purpose, risks, benefits, compensation, and all other pertinent study details. Participants will [ADDRESS_153325] 122 approximately 30 minutes. After completing the assessment, participants will be randomized to either  123 a) the mobile-based BMI+SFAS (mBMI+SFAS); or b) mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education 124 (mANE) (both described below). Immediately following the baseline assessment and random [ADDRESS_153326] for the mBMI+SFAS group will also collect information on past week time allocation, level of 134 discounting of future monetary rewards (delay discounting), and the subjective reward value of alcohol, [ADDRESS_153327] information on the participants’ experiences with the mobile-based 138 interventions and will solicit feedback about the interventions. They will then be thanked for their 139 participation and reminded of their 3-month follow-up appointment. 140 For completing the baseline assessment participants will be awarded either 1 hour of credit for 141 participation, which the researcher will grant through the SONA System, or $25. Participants may earn 142 $[ADDRESS_153328] surveys, and another $[ADDRESS_153329]-143 intervention assessment survey. This is to help ensure high survey completion rates.  144 All participants will be asked to download on to their smartphone or personal computer a secure 145 messaging web app called Babelnet (https://www.babelnet.com/en/). Babelnet is free to download and [ADDRESS_153330] 151 (via screenshot or copy-and-paste) the text conversations to facilitate later communication and for [ADDRESS_153331] approximately 30 minutes. Upon completion, participants will be thanked for their 158 participation, debriefed, and awarded 1 credit hour through the SONA System, or paid $20 for their 159 participation. Participants may earn a total of $65 for their participation across all study assessements 160 (baseline, boosters, post-intervention survey, and 3-month follow-up). 161 After the 3-month assessment, participants will be given the option to complete any of the intervention 162 sessions that they did not complete as a part of the study or to complete a session for a second time. 163 Interventions 164 Mobile-based Brief Motivational Interview (mBMI). Following the baseline assessment, participants will [ADDRESS_153332] approximately 60 minutes. 166 Personalized feedback will be provided with information on how the participant’s drinking compares to [ADDRESS_153333] 170 students in strategizing means for avoiding future consequences of drinking. The clinician will also 171 discuss and provide advice on avoiding driving after drinking if the participant endorses alcohol-impaired 172 driving. Participants will be instructed to view the personalized feedback document and respond to a 173 number of closed-ended questions embedded in the feedback document as a fidelity check. After 174 confirming receipt and processing of the document, the clinician will send participants text messages 175 containing the following open-ended questions:  176

Following the mBMI, participants will [ADDRESS_153338] a text exchange with 210 the participant containing the following open-ended questions: 211 1. What are your goals for college?  Tell more about why these goals are important to you? What 212 would be the benefits of accomplishing them? 213 2. What do you hope to do after you graduate? Tell me more about why this would be a good fit 214 for you?  What do you need to be doing right now and over the next year or so to achieve this 215 outcome?   216 3. How does your alcohol use fit in with your ability to accomplish your goals? 217 4. People rarely think about how they spend their time, even though it is a valuable resource and 218 says a lot about your priorities and goals.  219 a.

Following the baseline assessment, participants will complete a mobile text-[ADDRESS_153344] approximately 60 minutes (in terms of [ADDRESS_153345]). Participants will be provided with information on what is a standard drink of alcohol and 251 other alcohol-related term definitions, how alcohol is metabolized and how it effects the body, what 252 blood alcohol content (BAC) is, how to identify alcohol poisoning, alcohol tolerance, and the biphasic [ADDRESS_153346] sheets provided by 255 NIAAA: (https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets). 256 Mobile Nutrition Education*. Following the mobile Alcohol Education session, participants will schedule [ADDRESS_153347] approximately 60 minutes. Participants will be provided with information on the different food 259 groups (e.g., fruits, grains, proteins) and the types of foods in each food group (e.g., apples, bread, 260 chicken), key recommendations on foods/nutrients to increase (e.g., whole fruits/vegetables, whole 261 grains, fish/seafood) and food/food components to decrease (e.g., sodium, trans/saturated fats, sugar), [ADDRESS_153348] change in drinking behaviors.

Mixed modeling examines data similarly to repeated measures ANOVA; however, 274 mixed modeling provides increased flexibility in handling missing data by [CONTACT_135389] 275 each participant and provides ease of adaptation for multiple research designs (Hox, 2010; West, Welch, 276 and Galecki, 2007). For each model tested, one of the primary outcome variables will serve as the 277 dependent variable with gender, age, and ethnicity likely included as covariates. 278 Measures (Please see attached documents detailing measures for inclusion.) [ADDRESS_153349] of residence, and income/finance. Each of these demographic variables [ADDRESS_153350] been shown to be associated with driving after drinking and will be used as covariates in statistical 282 models.  283 Motivation to change. The Readiness Ladder (Biener & Abrams, 1991) will be used to assess motivation [ADDRESS_153351] intervention (i.e., after both the In-person and Text-based 285 interventions) to evaluate how motivation changes as a function of condition. This single item measure 286 has been found to be sensitive to changes in motivation in other brief alcohol intervention studies 287 (Murphy et al., 2010). 288 Discrepancy Rating Form (Neal & Carey, 2004). The Discrepancy Rating form is a 5-item self-report 289 measure that assesses the extent to which the individual believes alcohol is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_135369] 290 various aspects of their life, including relationships with friends and family, school work, health, and 291 appearance.  292 Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ; Collins, Parks, & Marlatt, 1985). Students will be asked to estimate [ADDRESS_153352] 294 month. The DDQ is frequently used to assess alcohol consumption patterns among college students and 295 is correlated with self-monitoring and retrospective drinking measures (Kivlahan, Marlatt, Fromme, 296 Coppel, & Williams, 1990). A separate item will be included to assess binge drinking. Students were 297 asked to report how many times they had drunk 4 or more (if female) or 5 or more (if male) standard [ADDRESS_153353] month (Wechsler et al., 1995). This measure will be used as a 299 secondary intervention outcome variable. 300 Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (B-YAACQ; Kahler, Strong, & Read, 2005). The [ADDRESS_153354] 303

This measure will be used as a secondary intervention outcome variable. 312 Income Questions. Participants will be asked questions pertaining to 1) parent’s annual household 313 income; 2) personal monthly income; 3) disposable income; 4) amount spent during the past month; 5) [ADDRESS_153356] month; and 6) amount spent on drugs during the past month.  [ADDRESS_153357] information on time spent in 16 different activity categories common to college students and 318 pertinent to the goals of the intervention (e.g., drinking/using drugs, studying, extracurricular activities, 319 class, community activities, exercise/sports; Murphy et al., 2006). Consistent with procedures from our [ADDRESS_153358] month. We will evaluate whether or not the SFAS resulted in 324 decreased time using alcohol or drugs, and increased time spent in substance-free activity categories, 325 and whether change in time use mediated any main effects on drinking and alcohol problems. The M-326 TLFB assessment will be used to provide personalized drinking feedback in the BMI, and feedback on 327 time allocation to substance use and to several categories of substance-free activities (e.g., 328 studying/academics, campus/community activities, volunteering, exercise) in the SFAS. This measure is 329 used to help create the feedback, which provides a visual overview of a person’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_135370].  330 Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The DASS-21 is a self-report instrument that consists of 331 three, 7-item subscales: stress, anxiety, and depression. Participants indicate on a 4-point scale how [ADDRESS_153359] week. Sample items include, “I found it hard to wind 333 down,” “I was aware of dryness in my mouth,” and “I couldn’t seem to experience any positive feeling at 334 all.” This measure will be used as an exploratory moderator. Previous research evaluating the SFAS 335 demonstrated that depression is an important moderator of treatment outcome (Murphy et al., 2012); 336 therefore, for the sake of relevance and brevity, the current study will only include the depression 337 subscale. 338 Delayed Discounting (DD). We will measure DD using a modified version of the Monetary Choice 339 Questionnaire (MCQ; Kirby [CONTACT_2297]., 1999). The modified MCQ is an 8-item measure of delayed reward 340 discounting with choices between two hypothetical amounts of money. Delay discounting will be 341 calculated using the approach described by [CONTACT_135392]. Hypothetical money choices provide a reliable 342 and valid estimate of discounting rates. This measure will be used as an exploratory moderator. 343 
Revised 6-2016  11	Alcohol Purchase Task (APT; Murphy et al., 2006) measure of alcohol reinforcing efficacy. The APT is a [ADDRESS_153360] drinking they would consume in a 346 hypothetical drinking scenario across 17 price increments ranging from zero (free) to $20 per drink. 347 Demand curves are estimated by [CONTACT_135393]’s reported consumption across the range of 348 prices to Hursh and Silberburg’s demand curve equation: ln Q = ln Q0 + k (e-αQ0C -1), where Q is [ADDRESS_153361], C, approaches zero, k specifies the range of 350 Q, and α is a measure of demand curve elasticity. Several reinforcing efficacy (RE) measures are 351 generated from the demand curve: 1) intensity of demand (alcohol consumption at the lowest price), 2) 352 Omax (maximum financial expenditure on alcohol); and 3) elasticity of demand (sensitivity of alcohol [ADDRESS_153362]). These RE indices are reliable, correlated with alcohol consumption 354 and problems, predictive of treatment response, and function as dynamic markers of intervention 355 response. This measure will be used as an exploratory moderator. 356 Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFCS; Strathman et al., 1994). The CFCS is a measure of 357 the extent to which an individual values immediate versus future rewards. The CFC consists of 12 358 statements weighing the present and the future; specifically, identifying whether or not the respondent 359 is more concerned with immediate outcomes as opposed to future outcomes. Participants will report 360 how much each statement represents them on a scale from 1 to 5 (1=extremely uncharacteristic to 5= 361 extremely characteristic). Several of the items are reverse coded to protect against random response. [ADDRESS_153363] Probability Index (RPI). The RPI [CONTACT_832] a self-report measure of an individual’s access to reward and [ADDRESS_153364]. It is a 20-item measure that consists of two subscales: Reward Probability [ADDRESS_153365] 367 deprivation. Environmental suppressors are obstacles in experiencing or engaging in rewarding activities 368 or opportunities. The 20 statements in the RPI [INVESTIGATOR_135371] a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 369 (strongly agree). Because behavioral economic theory proposes that it is the reward experienced from [ADDRESS_153366] 371 itself that influences level of substance use, the current study will only use the environmental 372 suppressors subscale.  373 Protective Behavioral Strategies Scale (PBSS). The PBSS is a 19-item measure that assesses the frequency 374 of engagement in protective or cognitive behavioral strategies specific to reducing alcohol consumption 375 or to drinking in a manner that reduces negative consequences. Respondents mark the frequency in 376 which they engage in each protective strategy on a scale from 0 to 5 (0=Never; 5=Always). The PBSS will 377 be incorporated in the feedback for the mBMI condition. 378 Short Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SSRQ). Behavior regulation and impulsivity will be measured using 379 the SSRQ-31. This measure consists of 31 statements related to self-regulation, such as “I feel bad when 380 I don’t meet my goals” and “I enjoy a routine and like things to stay the same”. These are scored 381 between 1 and 5 (1= strongly disagree and 5= strongly agree) and are added up to create a total self-[ADDRESS_153367] any subscales; factor analysis showed that all items load 383 heavily onto one factor (Carey, Neal, & Collins, 2004).

The project is designed to evaluate the effects of two different sets of text-message based information messages intended to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle.   2. Explanation of Procedures  You will be asked to complete several questionnaires related to your alcohol use and things that happen when you drink and your attitudes regarding drinking and other activities. We are asking you about some activities that are sensitive and in some cases illegal. However, we have obtained a federal Certificate of Confidentiality that ensures that any information you report will be kept confidential and not released to anyone (limits of confidentiality are discussed below).  Completing the questionnaires should take approximately 30 minutes. Then, you will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a mobile-based brief intervention or mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education. Using the mobile app Babelnet, participants will remotely complete the mobile-based brief intervention or alcohol education with a trained clinician immediately following the initial assessment.   Participants will complete a second session within the same week after the initial session, followed by a brief feedback survey of the initial 2 sessions. Participants will then complete booster text message sessions (~20 minutes each) that will take place once a week for [ADDRESS_153400] two sessions, participants will be awarded either 1 hour of credit for participation, which the researcher will grant through the SONA System, or $25. Participants will be awarded $10, or 0.[ADDRESS_153401] 3 boosters and $10, or 0.[ADDRESS_153402]-intervention assessment survey. Finally, upon completion of the 3-month follow-up assessment, participants will be thanked for their participation, debriefed, and awarded 1 credit hour through the SONA System, or paid $20 for their participation. This adds up to a total of $65, or [ADDRESS_153403] procedures are being implemented as planned. In addition, we plan to study parts of the interventions that are related to changes in alcohol use. This information will help us further improve future interventions for college students. These transcriptions will be identified only by [CONTACT_135401]. Any personal information provided during the session (e.g., names of friends, classes attended) will be purged from transcripts made of the sessions. In addition, any information on the transcriptions is protected by [CONTACT_135402] (see section 6). These transcripts will be destroyed following their use in this study.   3. Risks or Discomforts   The risk to you in this study would be due to loss of confidentiality due to the nature of the sensitive information you provide to us through email and text messages.  Though we will not be able to encrypt text messages, all messages will be sent from a secure mobile phone. The phones and email addresses we use will be password protected and kept in a secure locked room accessible only to research staff.  We will make every effort to ensure your privacy and protect the information that you give us. Additionally, you may experience some emotional discomfort in receiving information about your experiences with drinking. 4. Benefits We cannot guarantee that you will receive any benefits from this study. A possible benefit is that you may learn more about your alcohol use and your activity patterns.    5. Alternative Sources of Alcohol Information.   If you choose not to participate in this study, we can provide you with information on other resources on alcohol and drug use.   6. Confidentiality   If you decide to take part in this research study, as part of the research, you will be asked to give us information about various health behaviors. We have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The CoC has been issued to protect the investigators on this study from being forced to tell people that are not connected with this study about your participation in this study, even under a subpoena. The protection offered by [CONTACT_135398], 
Revised 6-[ADDRESS_153404] participants complete all measures on a secure web-based server. Raw data that is stripped of any identifiers will be retained and made available to the NIH per their data sharing policies.  Further, participants will be asked to download on to their smartphone or personal computer a secure messaging web app called Babelnet (https://www.babelnet.com/en/). Babelnet is free to download and use, and study personnel will assist participants in the download and use of the app. Participants will be assigned a userID and password. Because Babelnet does not store this information on their servers, study personnel will maintain this userID and password log in a password protected file on a password protected computer in a locked office only accessible to study personnel. Messages sent through Babelnet are heavily encrypted by [CONTACT_135403]. Study personnel will record (via screenshot or copy-and-paste) text-message intervention conversations for supervisory purposes. These records will be destroyed following their use in the study.  By [CONTACT_2371], there are a few limits to confidentiality. These limits were developed in part to insure the safety of research participants. The researchers are required by [CONTACT_135404][INVESTIGATOR_135375] a child may be in danger. If any of these situations should occur, we would attempt to contact [CONTACT_135405].  7. Decision to participate and right to quit at any time   Participation is voluntary and you may quit at any time.

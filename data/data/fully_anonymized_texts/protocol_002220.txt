1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction 
The optimal management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is important at 
population and health system levels due to substantial costs, morbidity and mortality.  At the 
individual patient level, experiencing shortness of breath, often on a daily basis, with periods of 
worsening symptoms, can have a big impact on quality of life, productivity, and outcomes.  Inhaled medications are the most effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_501987] – 
particularly when given in combina tion. (GOLD 2017)  Inhaled therapi[INVESTIGATOR_501988] (MDI), soft -mist inhalers (SMI), dry powder inhalers (DPI), and by [CONTACT_196094].   
Although DPI’s are breath -actuated and tend to be easier for patients to use than the MDI or SMI, 
there is emerging evidence that delivery from DPI [INVESTIGATOR_501989].  It has recently been shown that COPD patients can exhibit 
suboptimal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_501990] ( Loh, Sharma ) as well as in the 
outpatient setting ( Sulaiman 2017a ,  Jansenns ); it is unclear what impact this this may have on the 
effica cy and safety of DPIs.   Several population -based studies from the [LOCATION_008] report 
that a DPI (Diskus® inhaler),  with relatively low respi[INVESTIGATOR_501991] (portion delivered into target 
airways) and larger particle size  is associated with greater COPD exacerbation frequency and oropharyngeal side-effects compared to inhalers with a higher respi[INVESTIGATOR_501992]. ( Price , Jo
nes , Dekhuijzen)   Although published evidence regarding suboptimal 
delivery from DPIs in the COPD population is emerging, substantial knowledge gaps exist, including 
peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_501993].   This specific knowledge gap is the principal basis of our 
investigation. 
1.2 Name [CONTACT_502146] s  
This is an observational study but certain study procedures and PROs will be measured in the study . 
The proposed procedure is measurement of peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] (PI[CONTACT_115389]), using a device called 
In-Check DIAL® (Alliance Tech, Granbury, TX), and recording of respi[INVESTIGATOR_501994].  This device has been used in the clinical and research settings for 
more than a decade.  
 
 
 
BI Protocol Number: CTMS # 0352-[ADDRESS_646681] likely to reach target airways, varies widely among different multi- dose inhalers:  12 -35% for 
DPIs, 10-50% for MDI, and ~ 30% for SMI.  It has been shown that a higher fine particle fraction can result in greater lung delivery into the peripheral airways (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_460076]) - COPD is a disease that 
also affects the small airways.  For the SMI and MDI, a slow, deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_501995], whereas for the DPI, a rapid deep breath is required to de -agglomerate the 
pow der.   As noted previously, some COPD patients are not able to generate an adequate 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_501996].  
 
Depending on the DPI, the minimum peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] (PI[CONTACT_115389]) ranges from 30 L/min for the 
H
andihaler® to 60 L/min for the Diskus® and Ellipta® DPI’s. (Ghosh 2017, Mahler 2017).   The 
Handihaler® is a high -resistance DPI, whereas the Ellipta® and Diskus® are classified as medium-
resistance inhalers.  In vitro  studies indicate that the fine particle dose from Diskus®, and Ellipta® 
DPIs can be reduced when inspi[INVESTIGATOR_501997] 60 L/min (Buttini, Feddah, 
Yokohama, Grant, Prime), whereas other studies showed little effect. (Hamilton)    Recent studies 
in humans are finding that inhaled drug delivery with the Diskus® is suboptimal when the PI[INVESTIGATOR_501998] 60 L/min.  In a study of healthy volunteers using the Diskus® inhaler, a decrease  
in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_501999] 60 to 30 L/min resulted in 30% decrease in blood levels of albuterol and fluticasone 
(Sulaiman 2017b), indicative of decreased lung delivery. (Lipworth)   A recent study evaluated 
errors made by [CONTACT_502124]® over a one month period in the ambulatory setting post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  For this study, an audio monitoring device (INCA) was attached to the inhaler 
to measure the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_502000].  Subjects were edu cated on the 
proper use of the inhaler prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The most frequent error made by [CONTACT_502125][INVESTIGATOR_502001]-half of the COPD patients. ( Sulaiman 
2017b )   It is possible that PI[INVESTIGATOR_502002] a consequence of the recent exacerbation. 
In a study conducted in an outpatient research setting, using an instrumented Ellipta® inhaler, it was found that severe to very severe COPD patients had shorter insp iratory times and tended to 
have impaired inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (< 60 L/min) through the device. (Prime)   It appears that lung

   delivery with the Diskus® and Ellipta® may be suboptimal between 30 L/min and 60 L/min.  The 
a
forementioned data is the basis for the use of target PI[INVESTIGATOR_502003]®, Diskus®, and 
Ellipta® devices (30 L/min, 60L/min, and 60 L/min, respectively) for the current study.  We have also chosen to only enroll patients with a PI[CONTACT_115389] < 90 L/min at a medium resistance PI[INVESTIGATOR_502004] 
(Ellipt a®) in order to select a cohort that has a reasonable probability that their PI[INVESTIGATOR_502005](s) with worsened symptoms. 
 
P
atient-related impediments to achieving this minimum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_502006], gender, and stature (Seheult, Mahler 2013 ).  Mahler reported that persons most likely 
to have an impaired PI[INVESTIGATOR_502007], (Mahler 2013), thus the rationale for having 
an equivalent number of males and females participate in the present study.  Another factor that 
could affect inspi[INVESTIGATOR_502008] (standing, sitting, supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]).  It has been shown that peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] (Wade) and 
other pulmonary function test measures (Wallace) including forced residual capacity  are lower in 
a supi[INVESTIGATOR_502009] a standing position.  Therefore it is possible that a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_502010] a  supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], particularly with worsened respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219], could have decreased 
lung deposition from a DPI [INVESTIGATOR_502011].   Another scenario that a COPD patient could have impaired inspi[INVESTIGATOR_502012] a morbidly obese subject using their DPI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a 
sitting position, where the diaphragm is displaced upwards and thus the lungs are less capable to 
generate a strong inspi[INVESTIGATOR_21266].   To our knowledge, the effect of physical position of the COPD patient on PI[INVESTIGATOR_502013].  
 
D
isease related factors that could affect a patient’s inspi[INVESTIGATOR_502014], air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], narrowing of the airways, and worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_502015]. (Broeder, Jansenns, Malmberg, Taube, Loh, Sharma).   In COPD patients 
with air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], it was shown that in addition to a reduced forced residual capacity and decreased 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_14008], the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_502016]. (Taube)   Decreased inspi[INVESTIGATOR_502017] (Ghosh, Janssen, Mahler, Seheult) and during exacerbations requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. (Broeder, Loh, Sharma)  Studies by [CONTACT_502126][CONTACT_115389], below minimums for DPIs, occurred in a third or  more of COPD patients 
with acute exacerbations requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  The study by [CONTACT_502127][INVESTIGATOR_502018] a greater risk of all cause 90- day re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], whereas this was not 
found in the study by [CONTACT_502128].  In the study by [CONTACT_502129], the PI[INVESTIGATOR_502019] a sitting position. (personal communication)   The decrease in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_502020].      Broeder reported that PI[CONTACT_115389], using the 
InCheck DIAL®, increased between 17% and 22% between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26179] 5 weeks later 
when patients were clinically stable in the outpatient setting.  There are no published studies that 
 
BI Protocol Number: CTMS # 0352-[ADDRESS_646682] measured longitudinal changes in PI[INVESTIGATOR_502021].  
 
The In -Check DIAL® has been used for both clinical and research purposes for over 15 years to 
mimic the resistance to inspi[INVESTIGATOR_502022].  The In -Check G16 DIAL® ( Alliance Tech Medical, 
Granbury TX) is a simple hand -held device that measures PI[INVESTIGATOR_502023] a brief inspi[INVESTIGATOR_75043]. 
Measurement consists of a simple, [ADDRESS_646683] of three efforts  are recorded.  The InCheck DIAL® is designed to 
simulate the internal resistance of different inhalers and measure the PI[INVESTIGATOR_502024] a specific level 
of resistance, either to assess a patient’s ability to achieve a minimum effort recommended for DPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_502025] a specific inhaler.  The InCheck DIAL® measures PI[INVESTIGATOR_502026] 15 and 120 L/min with a +/ - 10% accuracy and has a repeatability 
of 5 L/min.  Calibration of the device was shown to meet American Thora cic Society (ATS) standards 
through testing with an ATS waveform generator.  The device includes a one-way disposable 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], measurement diaphragm, and a directly visualized PI[INVESTIGATOR_502027].  Importantly, the device 
also includes an adaptor with adjustable  resistances to mimic nine resistance groups encompassing 
the popular MDIs and DPIs currently commercially available. These have been used repeatedly for 
both research and clinical purposes since 1991 (Broeder).  Using these measurements against a set 
resistance, one can assess the frequency and degree of suboptimal PI[INVESTIGATOR_502028].  
 
To inform this application, [CONTACT_502148] and Ghosh have previously obtained IRB approval for a 
study to measure PI[INVESTIGATOR_502029] -Check DIAL® in a clinic -based, stable COPD patient population 
prescribed maintenance inhalers and free of recent exacerbation, as well as a group of healthy controls (UNC IRB 16 -3343; PI [INVESTIGATOR_502030]; data presented by [CONTACT_502130] 2017).  Over a four month 
period, 27 COPD patients and 19 healthy controls were recruited (Ghosh 2018).  Among COPD 
patients, 20/27 (74%) were able to generate PI[CONTACT_115389] >120 L/min when no internal resistance was 
applied.   However, PI[CONTACT_115389] (mean±SD) was 61±13 L/min with Diskus® resistance and 36±10 L/min 
with Handihaler® resistance.  In the COPD patients, 11 used a medium resistance DPI [INVESTIGATOR_67866], 25 a high resistance DPI [INVESTIGATOR_67866], and 14 were receiving both a medium and high -resistance DPI.   
Among the healthy controls, 19/19 (100%) were able to generate PI[CONTACT_115389] >120 L/min when no internal resistance was applied.  PI[INVESTIGATOR_502031] 97±13 L/min with Diskus® resistance and 55±7 L/min w ith 
Handihaler® resistance.  Overall, 15 (55%) of COPD patients were not able to generate optimal PI[CONTACT_115389] (defined as >45L/min for this study) on at least one prescribed DPI.  Compared to COPD patients 
able to generate optimal PI[CONTACT_115389], discordant COPD participan ts had a greater prevalence of 
uncontrolled COPD (defined as COPD Assessment Test≥10): 93% versus 83%.  Among nine

at baseline versus follow -up (65 L/min on visit 1 and 64 L/min on visit 2; p=0.69). Of the 14 
participants on a high resistance inhaler, there was no difference in baseline and repeated PI[INVESTIGATOR_502032] (38 L/min on visit 1 and 38 L/min on visit 2; p=0.4 6). A study duration of 24 weeks 
has been selected to ensure adequate duration to capture normal variability of PI[INVESTIGATOR_502033] (an important exploratory outcome).  
[ADDRESS_646685] ives:   
• The primary objective of the study is to determine the proportion of patients with suboptimal peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] (sPI[CONTACT_115389]) measurements amongst COPD patients receiving dry powder 
inhaler(s) (DPI) in the ambulatory setting.  
• The exploratory objectives are to characterize PI[INVESTIGATOR_501961], the  variability of PI[INVESTIGATOR_502034],  and the associations with potential predictors (demographics , clinical, PRO,  
body position, devi ce)  
• Additionally, we will explore the exacerbations frequency and change in PI[INVESTIGATOR_502035].

Octobe r – March (this translates into April and May being the only months to not enroll patients). 
Screening visits can be undertaken during these two months (April and May).  
3.4 Study Population 
Our study population will be outpatients with moderate, severe, or  very severe COPD.  
Participants will be recruited from multiple sources as described above.

4.2 Study Visits  
 
There will be six study visits/encounters over a 22 -26 week period as shown in the Study 
Procedures and Assessments Table.  Two  study visits will occur at the UNC Clinics  (Visits 1  and 2) 
 
BI Protocol Number: CTMS # 0352-2137 
 
 
  
16 
 
   and four  visits will only involve a telephone interview of subjects by [CONTACT_3462] (Visits 3, 4, 5 , 
and 6 ). 
   Visit [ADDRESS_646689] 1 L/min. Subjects will be excluded if PI[CONTACT_115389] > 90 L/min based on 
Ellipta® and Diskus® setting or inability to achieve minimum PI[INVESTIGATOR_502043] (< 30

administer their inhaler(s).  Further, they will be instructed to perform the PI[INVESTIGATOR_502046] (e.g. Ellipta® , Diskus® DPI , , 
Inhub ®) “Breathe out gently and breathe in steadily and deep”). For the Handihaler®, subjects will 
be instructed as follows – “Breathe out completely in one breath. Empty your lungs of air. Breathe 
in deeply until your lungs are full.” If the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria in cluding 
a PI[CONTACT_115389] < 90 L/min, they can proceed to Visit 2 (Enrollment) either during the same encounter or 
scheduled within [ADDRESS_646690] recent spi[INVESTIGATOR_502047]. No spi[INVESTIGATOR_502048].

If a patient decides to withdraw for any reason our contact [CONTACT_502134]. If participants have a change in their prescribed DPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_502058], study procedures will continue using previously  prescribed DPIs and noting 
prescription changes.  
 
4.7 Screen failure procedures  
All consented participants will receive a study ID number. Those who fail initial screening will be 
excluded and no information will be collected. If a participant failed initial screening due to 
temporary exclusion criteria (e.g., failed due to recent exacer bation, recent change in meds), the 
participant will be offered a re-screening visit for a future date outside of the exclusion window.   Last name [CONTACT_502147] a secured document to prevent re-screening.  
 
       5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS  
5.1 Data collection  
 
5.1.1 Data abstracted from electronic medical charts  
• Historical s pi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  
• Evidence of any COPD exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids within the last 
three years  
• Concurrent diseases  
• Prescribed COPD medications  
• Demographics: age, height, weight, gender  
 
5.1.2. Questionnaires  
 
The questionnaires administered will be the modified Borg dyspnea scale, modified Medical 
research Council, and the COPD Assessment Test.  Additional questionnaires will capture 
exacerbations, medication adherence, and inhaler regimens. The questionnaires will be self -
administered by [CONTACT_502135].  For the mMRC  (APPENDIX 2), mBorg (APPENDIX 3), and CAT (APPENDIX 4), the time 
period for subjects to self -assess symptoms is not specified.  Th e modified Borg dyspnea scale will 
be used for home monitoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219], whereas modified Medical Research Council 
 
BI Protocol Number: CTMS # 0352-2137 
 
 
  
19 
 
   score, modified Borg scale, and CAT will be used for clinic visits (2, 6) as well  the 4 telephone visits 
(3, 4, 5). In addition , CAT will be determined at the enrollment visit (Visit 1).  
             
When questionnaires are administered by [CONTACT_3462], they will be completed using a polite, 
professional, and non -judgmental tone.  Pacing of the interview will be adjusted to eac h 
participant. Interviewers will be familiar with the forms and questionnaires they are administering. Familiarity allows the coordinator to maintain eye contact [CONTACT_6635], which helps build 
rapport. The interviewer must be careful not to inadvertently change the wording of questions or 
instructions because he or she has partially memorized the interview. If a participant appears to 
not understand the question or provides an incomplete answer, the interviewer may employ 
several techniques to impr ove participant response. In the case of misunderstood questions, the 
interviewer may re-read the question with a different emphasis, stressing the part of the question 
the subject appears to have misunderstood. The interviewer should not modify the questi on 
wording. For incomplete answers, interviewers may use probing to further clarify a participant’s answer. The most commonly used probing technique is silence. In this situation the interviewer 
waits for the participant to provide an answer. Participants may require time to recall events or 
consider how to respond. If the participant seems uneasy with the length of time he or she is taking to answer a question, the coordinator may reassure the participant, i.e., “Take your time” or “There 
is no rush.”  
 
5.1.3. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]:  
 
Historical spi[INVESTIGATOR_502059]. If multiple spi[INVESTIGATOR_502060], the most contemporaneous will be abstracted. This will also include the age, height and weight at the time of spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].

   6 S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATION    
 
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
For each patient the occurrence of suboptimal Peak Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_29330] (sPI[CONTACT_115389]) over 24 weeks. sPI[INVESTIGATOR_502076] (e.g.,<30 L/min for Handihaler® (High resistance DPI), <60 L/min for Ellipta® (Medium resistance DPI))  
  
6.2  Exploratory Endpoints   
PI[INVESTIGATOR_501966] : 
1. Time to first occurrence of sPI[CONTACT_115389] (in days)  
2. Number and proportion of sPI[CONTACT_115389]  
3. Rate of sPI[CONTACT_115389], defined as the number of sPI[CONTACT_115389] / number of days in the study, multiplied by 30 as 
sPI[CONTACT_115389]/month.  
 
 
Exacerbation Endpoints:  
Occurrence (yes/no), number, severity (mild, moderate, severe) and rate of COPD exacerbations over 24  
weeks. Mild, moderate and severe exacerbations will be defined as: 
 
1. Mild – doubling use of inhaled rescue medication > 48 hours and not meeting d efinition of moderat e 
or severe   
2. Moderate – increased rescue medication and either oral corticosteroid or antibiotics , not requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
3. Severe – hospi[INVESTIGATOR_502077] 
 
6.3 Statistical Methods  
 
Analysis populations  
Full analysis set (FAS): all screened patients with informed consent and at least two consecutive PI[INVESTIGATOR_502078].  
 
Descriptive Statistics  
 
BI Protocol Number: CTMS # 0352-2137 
 
 
  
22 
 
   Using the FAS, the following variables will be described using descriptive statistics (mean and standard 
deviation, min, max, median) and graphical displays (boxplots, histograms).  Data transformation will be used if 
applicable, and extreme values will be verified and their effect on analysis results will be reported.  
 demographics and clinical variables  
 patient reported outcome s (CAT, mBORG and mMRC)  
 concomitant diseases and medications  
 
Primary analysis  
The primary endpoint will be described as the proportion of patients with suboptimal PI[INVESTIGATOR_502079] 
95% confidence intervals, on the FAS . The proportion of sPI[INVESTIGATOR_502080] -Meier curve.  
 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint: 
 per DPI [CONTACT_169259] (moderate vs. high resistance)  
 per gender  
 per GOLD stage based on spi[INVESTIGATOR_502081]. 
 
Analysis of exploratory endpoints : o n FAS.  
 We will analyze the PI[INVESTIGATOR_502082], specifically:  
• Descriptive analysis of PI[INVESTIGATOR_501962], including mean (SD), median (IQR), range over time per 
patient per device, and in different body positions (standing, sitting, supi[INVESTIGATOR_16717] 45 degrees). PI[INVESTIGATOR_502083]/device can be explored. Descriptive analysis for different time’s period (week, month) may be 
explored.  
• The time of first occurrence of sPI[INVESTIGATOR_502084] a Kaplan -Meier 
curve. A patient will be considered censored for sPI[INVESTIGATOR_502085], the end of the study, the switching of device (between medium and high resistance DPI) 
or death (whichever occurs earlier), if they did not experience a sPI[INVESTIGATOR_502086]. Associations with possible 
demographics and clinical var iables will be explored using a Cox regression analysis.  
• The proportion of suboptimal PI[INVESTIGATOR_502087] 95% CI, and also the rates. This 
analysis will also be performed per device in patients that used two devices with different resistances (e.g. Advair + Spi[INVESTIGATOR_502088]).  
• We will explore, for each device, with logistic regression (binary) or negative binomial (count) the clinical and demographic factors associated with sPI[INVESTIGATOR_501962].  
• We will use mixed models to explore associations of monthly PFIR averages over time and clinical and demographic factors. Subjects will be considered as random factor, other variables will be considered fixed effects.  
• Association of PI[INVESTIGATOR_501983], mBORG score and mMRC  
 Association of PI[INVESTIGATOR_502089] s cores at V1, V3, V4, V5,V6 (for PI[CONTACT_115389], use the measurement in the week 
of each telephone follow -up, or the month average)  
 
BI Protocol Number: CTMS # 0352-2137 
 
 
  
23 
 
    Correlation of change in CAT scores with change in PI[INVESTIGATOR_502090] 24 weeks  
 Association of PI[INVESTIGATOR_502091] V2, V3, V4, V5, V6 
 Association of PI[INVESTIGATOR_502092] V1, V3, V4, V5,V6 (for PI[CONTACT_115389], use the measurement in the 
week of each telephone follow -up, or the month average)  
 
For COPD exacerbation analyses, the proportion of patients with COPD exacer bations  (from Kaplan Meier curve) 
and the rate of exacerbations occurring during follow -up will be reported along with 95% CI. A patient will be 
considered censored for exacerbations  at the time of the last documented visit, the end of the study, the 
switching of device (between medium and high resistance DPI) or death (whichever occurs earlier), if they did 
not experience an exacerbation before.  The exacerbations will be reported overall and stratified by [CONTACT_926].  
The associations between exacerbations and PI[INVESTIGATOR_502093], for all exacerbation, 
stratified by [CONTACT_502137], and stratified by [INVESTIGATOR_16897].  
 The rate of exacerbations and sPFIR will be analyzed with negative binomial models  (or another 
model if more appropriate). 
 For patients with exacerbations, the mean of PI[INVESTIGATOR_502094], of, and after each 
exacerbation will be calculated and reported.  
 
All tests with p value < 0.05 will be interpreted nominally as statistically s ignificant.  
 
Missing data  
 No imputation for PI[CONTACT_115389]  
 No imputation for COPD exacerbations  
 No imputation for CAT, mBORG and mMRC  
 
Sample Size and Power  
In this application, we propose to recruit 120 COPD participants for study enrollment. There are several rationales for this sample size selection.  
 The primary outcome focuses on characterizing the proportion of participants with suboptimal PI[CONTACT_115389]. There 
are no available data on prevalence of sPI[INVESTIGATOR_502095], highlighting the novel ty 
of this proposal. While there is no established clinical threshold of variability of proportion with suboptimal PI[CONTACT_115389], it is felt that a precision of <10% (95% CI range <20%) is desirable for clinical interpretation of sPI[INVESTIGATOR_502096]. From pi[INVESTIGATOR_9958], we observed that 40% of patients had sPI[CONTACT_115389]. We have generated three 
scenarios with different ranges of proportion of sPI[CONTACT_115389] (30%, 40%, and 50%) along with the required sample 
sizes to obtain a range of precisions (see table). Given that clinical exper tise and judgement suggests that 
a precision of <10% is acceptable for this study, one can see that sample size range of N=105 to 125 will achieve this precision across a range of possible sPI[INVESTIGATOR_502097] (highlighted column).

   9 CONSENT PROCESS  
HIPPA authorization will allow us to screen patients’ m edical record after permission from primary 
pulmonologist. This will allow us to screen for inclusion criteria prior to approaching the patients 
and minimize the likelihood of approaching patients who would not qualify. Informed consent is 
the first data collection form administered during the research encounter. A signed informed consent means the patient fully understands the requirements of the procedures and assessments included in the study as well as the risks of those procedures/assessments. It is im portant that the 
patient fully comprehends the time commitment required for participation, as well as the potential 
implications of specimen storage and dissemination of study findings.  
  
● Reception  
Upon arrival at the clinical center the study coordinator should greet the patient and confirm 
patient’s identity. No data can be collected until the full informed consent has been obtained.  
 
● Administration  
The study coordinator and/or investigator should take the patient to a quiet, private area to r eview 
the informed consent. The coordinator should provide a copy of the consent to the participant, and 
ask the participant whether he or she would like to read the consent form or have it read to them 
by [CONTACT_502138]. If the participant is visually handicapped, the coordinator should read the form 
to him or her. If the participant chooses to read the form, the coordinator should still review, although not read, the consent form with the participant to ensure he or she is fully informed. This should be handled sensitively, so as not to imply poor comprehension on the part of the patient. 
The coordinator should encourage the participant to ask for clarification or any questions he or she 
may have. The original signed copy of the informed consent should b e kept with the participant’s 
study information. A copy of the consent form should be provided to the participant.  
 
● Training and Certification  
All study personnel interacting with participants must have received appropriate training and certification in confidentiality, privacy, and informed consent prior to having any contact [CONTACT_62939].  
 
● Data and Collection  
Informed consents are collected on paper. 
 
● Ability to Comprehend the Informed Consent  
The ability to provide informed consent is a requirement for participation in the study. In order to remain in compliance with ethical and regulatory standards, study coordinators should make every effort to ensure the patients understand their rights and risks when participating in this study . It can 
be difficult to determine whether a participant understands the informed consent. Behaviors and patterns to look for that might indicate poor comprehension include repetitive behaviors and speech patterns and looking to spouses and companions for assistance answering questions. If the coordinator doubts the patient’s comprehension, he or she can ask the patient to explain the rights 
 
BI Protocol Number: CTMS # 0352-2137 
 
 
  
26 
 
   and risks detailed in the consent form in his or her own words. If the coordinator continues to 
question the ability of the patient to consent, he or she should speak with the PI. 
10. MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE REACTIONS  
 
10.1 DEFINITIONS OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 Adverse event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefor e be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
 Adverse reaction (ADR)  
An adverse r eaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. Adverse reactions may arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorization  or from occupational 
exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include off -label use, overdose, 
misuse, abuse and medication errors.  
 Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event is defined as any AE which  
 Results  in death,  
 Is life -threatening  
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
 Prolongation  of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
 Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Life-threatening in this context refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe.  
 
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_502103] t jeopardize the patient or might 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
 
BI Protocol Number: CTMS # 0352-[ADDRESS_646697] (AESI)  
The term AESI relates to any specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this study, e.g. 
the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class.  
 No AESIs have been defined for this study.  
 
10.2 ADVERSE EVENT AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT COLLECTION AND REPORTING  
 The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files.  
 INSTITUTION/Investigator will be responsible for  reporting AEs which occur during the conduct of 
the Study , (i.e. from signing of informed consent to end of data collection),  to the competent 
regulatory authorities, accredited Institutional Review Boards and/or Independent Ethics Committee(s) (“IRB/IEC( s)”) in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.  
 
10.3  ADVER SE EVENT REPORTING TO BOEHRINGER -INGELHEIM (BI)  
  INSTITUTION shall report  
(i) All ADRs (serious and non -serious)  
(ii) All AEs with fatal outcome  (iii) P regnancies in female subjects and partners of male subjects  
 which are associated with the BI Drug  (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444], Combivent, Stiolto, Striverdi, Atrovent) ,  
administered for the disease (COPD)  in scope of the study by [CONTACT_502139].

 All Serious ADRs and AEs with fatal outcome shall be forwarded immediately (within twenty four 
(24) hours or next business day whichever is shorter). All non-serious ADRs and Pregnancy 
Monitoring Fo rms shall be forwarded within seven (7) calendar days . The investigator carefully 
assesses whether an AE constitutes an ADR using the information below.

Causal relationship of adverse event : The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a 
reason able possibility of a causal relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an 
adverse event. An adverse reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterized by [CONTACT_49392] a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected.   
 Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, 
including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, confounding 
factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history.  
 Causality should be assessed for each event as either “yes” or “no”. No other variation should be reported.  
 Intensity of adverse event : The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following:  
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) which is/are easily tolerated  
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities  
 Pregnancy:  
In rare cases, pregnancy m ight occur in a study. Once a subject has been enrolled into the study, 
after having taken BI Drug administered for the disease in scope of the study, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy, which occurred in a female subject or in  a partner to a 
male subject to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_502140].  
 In the absence of a reportable AE, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form must be completed, otherwise the NIS AE form is to be completed and forwarded as well within the respective timelines.  
 
Reporting of related Adverse Events associated with any other BI drug  
The investigator is encouraged to report all adverse events related to any BI drug other than the BI 
drug taken for the disease in scope of the study according to the local regulatory requirements for spontaneous AE reporting at the investigator’s discretion by [CONTACT_502141].  The term AE includes drug exposure during pregnancy, and, regardless of whether 
an AE  occurred or not, any abuse, off -label use, misuse, medication error, occupational exposure, 
lack of effect, and unexpected benefit.

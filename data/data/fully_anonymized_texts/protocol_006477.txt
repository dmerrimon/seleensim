Ischemic Stroke  
Aims  
 To evaluate in acute ischemic stroke patients due to a large vessel occlusion in the 
anterior circulation (MCA M1 and ICA):  
 
 If thrombectomy, as compared to medical management, will be efficacious and 
safe in patients with large core on either CT (ASPECTS: 3-5) or advanced 
perfusion imaging ([rCBF<30%] on CTP or [ADC<620] on MRI: 50cc), treated 
within 0-[ADDRESS_953097] known well.

Imaging 
Assessments 1. CT images will be read by [CONTACT_702139]. ASPECTS for patient selection will be 
determined independently by [CONTACT_702140]. In cases where there is disagreement, the physician 
reading will override the automated software reading. 
2. CTP images with mismatch determination will be read by [CONTACT_702141].   
3. All the images will be adjudicated by a blinded core lab at McGovern Medical 
School at UTHealth.  
Randomization 
 Randomization will be done in the emergency room using a web-based dynamic 
randomization system. Covariate adaptive randomization will be conducted to 
balance the distribution of the randomization by [CONTACT_654] (<60, 60-69, 70-79, 80-85 years 
old), presentation NIHSS (6-9, 10-15, 16-20, >20), center, clot location (M1, ICA), 
treatment time window (0-8, 9-16, 17-24 hours from onset to randomization time), 
CTP/MRP core volume (<50cc, 50-100cc, >100cc), presence or absence of target 
mismatch profile (  and 
hemisphere (right, left).  
 
The randomization algorithm we are going to implement is the algorithm developed 
by [CONTACT_75838] (1975), i.e., minimization method. Through this algorithm, the 
assignment of a new patient to a treatment group is determined so as to minimize 
the differences between the groups in terms of these important key baseline 
variables. Unlike traditional stratified randomization, the minimization method 
works toward minimizing the total imbalance for all factors together instead of 
considering mutually exclusive subgroups, that is, we will not be creating these 
mutually exclusive subgroups during the randomization. Therefore, this approach is 
not restricted by [CONTACT_702142].  
 
SELECT [ADDRESS_953103] (ASPECTS 3-5) or perfusion imaging (CTP: 
rCBF<30% or MRP: ADC<620 50cc) or both within 0-[ADDRESS_953104] known well 
will be randomized into thrombectomy plus medical management vs medical 
management alone.  
Interventions Endovascular Thrombectomy:  Patients randomized to endovascular thrombectomy, 
will be treated with t  and/or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_702119]. The choice of thrombectomy method, primary 
approach/technique, whether primary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_702120]-retriever with or 
without aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], will be left up to the interventionalist, with any of the FDA-
approved devices approved in the study protocol or a combination of them 
(Appendix C). Standard medical therapy, based on current AHA guidelines, will also 
be provided for all patients.  
 
Medical Management:  Patients randomized to medical management only will 
receive standard medical therapy based on current AHA guidelines. Patients will 
receive IV thrombolytic therapy available for use according to practice guidelinesif 
presented within the first [ADDRESS_953105] DVT prevention therapy.  
Assessment 
and Visits 
 Clinical assessments will be done at baseline, 24-hours after randomization,  
day 5-7 or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (whichever is earlier), 30 days, and 90 days:

Protocol 
 Scientific Background  
Endovascular thrombectomy efficacy and safety was established initially up to 6 hours from 
stroke onset (the early time window) from several randomized controlled trials (MR CLEAN1, 
REVASCAT2, ESCAPE3, SWIFT PRIME4, and EXTEND-IA5
only on patients with favorable imaging profiles (minimal ischemic changes) on CT defined as 
imaging defined as small core infarct with a large area of 
mismatch. Later, two trials (DAWN6 and DEFUSE 37) extended the safety and efficacy up to 24 
hours (the late time window). The late window trials utilized advanced perfusion images with 
the same criteria of small core infarct and a large area of mismatch. As a result, these inclusion 
criteria excluded patients with unfavorable imaging profiles (significant ischemic changes), 
including patients with ASPECTS <[ADDRESS_953108] volume > 50-70 cc. Thus, thrombectomy 
efficacy and safety in these patients with unfavorable profiles (large core) on imaging is not 
established.  
 
Moreover, the different trials used different imaging modalities for including or excluding 
patients, simple imaging with non-contras
imaging with small infarct core and mismatch, with the vast majority of the patients having 
favorable imaging profile on at least one modality (CT and/or perfusion imaging). Thus: 
 
1.  The correlation between the different imaging profiles and thrombectomy outcomes is 
not established and the optimal imaging selection prior to thrombectomy is unknown. 
2. Many patients were not represented in the trials, especially those with discordance 
between the two imaging modalities.

 Thrombectomy in Patients with Unfavorable Imaging Profiles (i.e. Large Core)   
 
Endovascular thrombectomy is safe and efficacious in selected patients with acute ischemic 
strokes (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation up to [ADDRESS_953110] with 
2-4. EXTEND-IA5 was the only early window trial that solely used 
perfusion imaging criteria (core infarct volume < 70cc with a mismatch ratio of > 1.2 & 
mismatch volume > 10 cc). The trial only enrolled [ADDRESS_953111] core but some were

a limited number of patients with an ASPECTS < 6. Based on the results of these trials, the 
American Heart Association recommended the use of thrombectomy in patients with large

Both the trials assessing thrombectomy safety and efficacy in the late time window used 
perfusion imaging. The DAWN6 only included core infarct volume of up to > 50 cc on perfusion 
images and the trial excluded patients with involvement of >1/3rd of MCA territory on simple 
CT. The DEFUSE [ADDRESS_953112] core, with median (IQR) core infarct volume of 8 (2-

data8. This population of patients represents a good portion of the patients encountered in 
daily practice without strong evidence from randomized trials to support treatment decision.  
 
Data from a few prospective and retrospective non-randomized studies reported reasonable 
rates of good clinical and safety outcomes after thrombectomy in patients with unfavorable 
Treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke (SELECT): A Prospective Multicenter Cohort Study of 
ators were allowed to enroll patients with unfavorable imaging 
profiles/large core on either CT or advanced perfusion imaging or both. The treatment decision 
in these patients, thrombectomy vs. medical management, was not randomized and rather 
based on the discretion of the site investigators. The study found that patients with unfavorable 
imaging profile on either or both imaging modalities formed a significant proportion of the daily 
clinical practice with up to 1/4th of patients demonstrating significant ischemic changes on one 
or both imaging modalities. In SELECT, thrombectomy was associated with improved functional 
independence in patients with an unfavorable profile on one or both imaging modalities (EVT: 
30% vs MM: 13%, Adjusted OR: 2.92, 95%CI=1.00-7.91, p=0.041). Thrombectomy was also 
associated with a significant shift towards better outcomes across the full distribution of 
modified Rankin Scale scores (adjusted OR: 2.01, 95%CI=1.00-4.03, p=0.049). (Figure 1).

For safety outcomes, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages rates (EVT: 7% vs MM only: 13%, 
p=0.26) and mortality (EVT: 29% vs MM only: 42%, p=0.17) did not statistically differ between 
thrombectomy and medical management only arms. 
 
In a post-hoc analysis of the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment 
for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands (MR CLEAN), the investigators compared the rates 
of good outcome in patients with CTP ischemic core volume>70 cc, who received 
thrombectomy or medical management. The rate of good outcome (mRS 0-2) was 8% in the 
thrombectomy vs 0% in the medical management group. The rate of mortality was 38% versus 
33%, respectively10. In another secondary analysis of MR CLEAN trial, thrombectomy patients 
with ASPECTS 0-4 had 9% rate of good outcome (mRS=0-2), compared to 0% in medical therapy 
patients. Mortality rate was lower in the thrombectomy group (36% vs 42%). Similarly, in 
patients with ASPECTS 5-7, thrombectomy patients had 32% good outcome versus 13% in 
medical management patients with a slightly lower mortality rate (24% vs 26%, respectively)11.  
 
In a retrospective multicenter study12, the outcome rates in patients who received 
thrombectomy were compared between those with CT ASPECTS<[ADDRESS_953115] profiles. There was no statistically significant difference in good 
clinical outcome mRS 0-
intracerebral hemorrhage (9% vs 9%, p=1.0), or mortality (20% vs 22%, p=0.8).  
 
Rebello et al. (2017) compared the outcomes of patients with unfavorable CTP profile [rCBF 
<30%] >50 cc who underwent thrombectomy versus matched controls who had medical 
management only13. The results showed that compared to medical management, 
thrombectomy was statistically associated with favorable shift in the distribution of 90-day 
modified Rankin scale (mRS) (odds ratio: 2.56; 95%CI: 2.50-8.47; p=0.04), higher rates of good

clinical outcome (mRS=0-2) (thrombectomy=25% vs medical therapy=0%; p=0.04), as well as 
smaller infarct volumes (mean [SD], thrombectomy=87 [77] vs medical therapy=242 [120] mL; 
p<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for safety 
outcomes including parenchymal hematoma type 2 (p>0.99), hemicraniectomy (p=0.10), and 
90-day mortality (p=0.75).  
 
These contrasting results with some reporting a potential signal for benefit and others 
reporting no difference in good outcome rates between thrombectomy and medical 
management alone, along with the lack of higher level of evidence from randomized trials 
support the need for randomized trials to test the efficacy and safety of thrombectomy in 
patients with unfavorable imaging profiles. The current status of inadequate evidence results in 
different treatment approaches in patients with unfavorable imaging profiles, with some 
patients being treated with thrombectomy while the majority receiving medical management 
only. 
 
We hypothesize that endovascular thrombectomy is safe and efficacious in patients with acute 
ischemic strokes due to large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation (ICA, MCA/M1) with 
large ischemic lesion volumes on simple (non-contrast CT head) or advanced perfusion imaging 
(CT or MRI perfusion) as compared to medical management only up to [ADDRESS_953117] profile (ASPECTS 6-
10)  and unfavorable perfusion imaging profile (CTP: rCBF <30% volume or 
MRP: ADC <620 50cc) 
Most of the early window (0-6 hours) trials limited the use of perfusion imaging for patient 
selection. Only SWIFT PRIME4 and EXTEND  IA5 used perfusion imaging to exclude patients 
with the larger ischemic core (> 50-70 cc).  Recently a patient-level meta-analysis of early 
window trials examining the impact of perfusion imaging parameters was published, including 
more than 1700 patients from 6 randomized controlled trials14. The study demonstrated 8% 
good outcome in patients with ischemic core volume of [ADDRESS_953118],2021
16 
 
2
thrombectomy compared to 0% in patients treated with medical management only. In a 
univariate shift analysis, the study showed the benefit of thrombectomy, which disappeared 
once adjusted for confounders. No difference in symptomatic ICH (EVT  0%, MM  12%, 
p=0.24) was reported. Thus, true evidence of efficacy in this patient group is still lacking. The 
recommendation for using only simple CT imaging for patient selection in the early window 
(within 6 hours) was recently rescinded from the American Heart Association stroke guidelines8. 
 
In an analysis of our recently concluded SELECT trial within early window (thrombectomy within 
6 hours of stroke onset), functional independence rates were 101/173 (58%) in patients with 
ASPECTS score of 6 or more and with ischemic core volume of < 50cc. This rate reduced to 6/18 
(33%) in patients with ASPECTS scores of 6 or more but ischemic core volume of 50-100 cc, 
which approached the medical management only rates reported in early window 
thrombectomy trials. The safety outcomes  symptomatic ICH (8/173 (5%) vs 3/18 (17%), 
p=0.072), neurological worsening (14/173 (8%) vs 5/18 (28%), p=0.023) and mortality (15/173 
(9%) vs 7/18 (39%), p=0.001) also significantly increased in the subgroup when ischemic core 
volume was large. Thus, in these patients the outcomes changed significantly as the infarct core 
volume increased on perfusion imaging: the good outcomes reduced in half, while the safety 
outcomes doubled. With a limited representation of this subgroup in clinical trials assessing 
thrombectomy in the early window, no conclusive evidence is available and there is equipoise 
to justify randomization between thrombectomy and medical management alone. 
 
In the late window, no randomized evidence exists for the efficacy of thrombectomy in these 
patients. Two randomized controlled trials (DAWN6 & DEFUSE 37) assessing the efficacy and 
safety of thrombectomy in the late window used both simple (CT) as well as advanced 
perfusion imaging to exclude patients. The DAWN6 study only included patients with ischemic 
core volume of up to 50cc, while the DEFUSE [ADDRESS_953119],2021
17 
 
2
volume between 50-70cc. Thus, no substantial conclusion of efficacy and safety of 
thrombectomy can be made within this subgroup for the late window as well. 
 
 Rationale for including patients with very large core on advanced perfusion 
(CTP: rCBF (<30%) volume or MRP: ADC < 620 >100cc) 
Limited non-randomized evidence of thrombectomy efficacy is available in the published 
literature. A recently published study, a meta-analysis of [ADDRESS_953120] core of >[ADDRESS_953121] better functional outcome than patients treated with medical 
management only. Thus, the protocol was amended to include these patients in the study. 
Stringent safety monitoring of mortality and symptomatic ICH is employed to ensure patient 
safety. The amended inclusion criteria will allow for:  
1) Assessment of population with CTP/MRP core infarct >100cc  
2) More generalizability of the study findings 
3) No dependency on perfusion criteria, which will allow for the population to be 
treated based on non-contrast CT only. Providing data on the efficacy and safety of 
thrombectomy selection based on a non constrast CT, which is more readily 
available, would result in an increased thrombectomy availability to centers without 
perfusion imaging.  
Although no upper limit is specified for infarct core volume measurements on CT or MR 
perfusion imaging, the infarct size is still expected to be limited, to an extent, given imaging

thrombectomy efficacy and safety is available, these patients were excluded from the trial.

 Imaging selection for thrombectomy  
 
Thrombectomy is a highly effective treatment for anterior circulation LVO patients based on the 
results of several recent randomized clinical trials1-7. However, the imaging modalities and the 
patient populations enrolled, varied between the studies. For example, the Multicenter 
Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the 
Netherlands (MR CLEAN)[ADDRESS_953125] (NCCT) with the inclusion criteria of less 
than one third of the MCA, while the Solitaire with the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary 
Endovascular Treatment trial (SWIFT PRIME)[ADDRESS_953126] Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to 
Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset  
(REVASCAT)3, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_702122], applied a more stringent inclusion criterion of the Alberta

Proximal Occlusion with Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE)[ADDRESS_953128]-Profusion profile. Extending the Time for 
Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits  Intra-Arterial trial (EXTEND-IA)5 was the 
sole early window trial that purely based imaging selection on advanced perfusion imaging 
using CTP/RAPID.  
 
This resulted in uncertainty in regards to optimal patient selection when it comes to imaging 
modality prior to thrombectomy as reflected in the current AHA guidelines, and the guideline 
recommending against using advanced perfusion imaging for patients presenting in early time 
window was recently rescinded8.

The recent trials evaluating thrombectomy effectiveness in the late time window -  Clinical 
Mismatch in the Triage of Wake Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing Neurointervention 
With TREVO (DAWN)6 and Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation For Ischemic 
Stroke 3 (DEFUSE3)7 used advanced imaging perfusion (CTP and MR-Perfusion) utilizing the 
RAPID software along with NCCT criteria to select patients. As a result, the recent AHA 
guidelines also recommend the use of both CT and advanced perfusion imaging for patient 
selection in thrombectomy8.  
 
In conclusion, the optimal imaging selection modality prior to thrombectomy is still unknown. 
Furthermore, the restrictive imaging inclusion criteria and correlation with outcomes, both 
functional independence, and safety outcomes are still yet undetermined. To measure the 
correlation between the two different imaging modalities and clinical outcomes, patients with 
discordant imaging profiles should be compared. 
 
The highest level of evidence comes from a randomized controlled trial comparing 
thrombectomy outcome rates as well as safety parameters in patients selected by [CONTACT_702144]. However, a randomized trial is not feasible given the level of evidence 
from RCTs in the late window patients treated based on favorable perfusion imaging profiles 
(DAWN6 and DEFUSE 37). Additionally, the current AHA guidelines recommend the use of 
perfusion imaging for selection of patients in the late window8.  
 
Since the clinical trials evaluating thrombectomy largely included patients with favorable 
profiles on both CT and perfusion imaging, the vast majority of the currently available data is on 
these patients. Thus, the correlation between the thrombectomy outcome rates with different 
imaging profiles, specifically with discordance profiles between CT and perfusion images, is not 
well established. However, those patients with discordant imaging profiles on both modalities 
are frequently encountered in real-world practice. There is currently no evidence from 
randomized trials to guide the treatment decision in these patients. Many of these patients 
SELECT [ADDRESS_953130], we observed that the two imaging modalities (CT and CT 
perfusion) had an agreement with favorable profiles in 81% of patients and an unfavorable 
profile on both modalities in 4% of patients. Discordance between the two imaging modalities 
was observed in 15% of patients with 7% showing favorable CT but unfavorable CTP and 8% 
showing unfavorable CT but favorable CTP. The agreement between imaging modalities and 
outcomes are shown in Figure 3.

As shown above, discordance between imaging profiles was not uncommon and clinical 
outcomes differed based on the presence and type of discordant imaging profiles. Patients with 
discordant profiles showed outcomes better than patients with both imaging modalities 
demonstrating an unfavorable profile.  
 
The two groups where both imaging modalities (CT and perfusion imaging) agree: 
1. Unfavorable profiles on both: the results would not contribute to the comparison of 
imaging selection.  
2. Favorable profile on both: there is, as detailed, strong evidence from RCTs supporting 
thrombectomy in both early and late time windows; thus randomizing these patients to 
compare imaging selection for thrombectomy is unethical and not feasible.  
 
In SELECT 2, in order to compare the outcomes between imaging selection modalities, we 
propose to examine the correlation between the discordance in imaging profile and outcome 
rates, both functional independence as well as safety outcomes. We also propose to examine if 
there is a heterogeneity of treatment effect of thrombectomy in patients with discordant 
imaging profile (favorable CT/unfavorable perfusion imaging and unfavorable CT/favorable 
perfusion imaging).   
 
Based on the SELECT trial results, patients with unfavorable CT/ favorable CTP had 48% good 
outcomes vs favorable CT/unfavorable CTP with 32% good outcomes (16% absolute difference). 
A superiority margin at 15% will be set between the two discordance groups and good outcome 
rates between patients with discordant imaging profiles will be compared. If those differences 
do not reach the statistical margin, then among patients with discordant imaging profile who 
met the inclusion criteria for SELECT [ADDRESS_953132]/ unfavorable perfusion imaging 
and those with unfavorable CT/favorable perfusion imaging. If no heterogeneity exists, then 
thrombectomy benefit is not modified in the two scenarios when the two imaging modalities 
disagree.  
 
 Thrombectomy efficacy and safety in patients with favorable CT but 
unfavorable perfusion imaging profile 
 
Early window trials demonstrated the superiority of thrombectomy over standard medical 
management in patients selected by [CONTACT_702147] (ESCAPE and REVASCAT) or favorable 
perfusion imaging (EXTEND-IA and a portion of SWIFT-PRIME). Thus, in patients with favorable 
CT profile, thormbectomy is proven superior to standard medical management in early window. 
Late window trials, DAWN6 and DEFUSE [ADDRESS_953133] would benefit 
from thrombectomy and thus, should be treated with thrombectomy. 
 
 Rationale and use of iSchemaView RAPID and iSchemaView RAPID ASPECTS 
 
iSchemaView RAPID: At the conclusion of the CT/MR Perfusion scan, the technologist sends the 
sequences from the console to RAPID for automated processing. The RAPID software was 
developed based on data from DEFUSE [ADDRESS_953134],2021
24 
 
2
investigators (protected health information is automatically removed) and auto-sent to PACS 
for viewing within 5 minutes of completion of the scan. Immediately after the images are 
available, the investigator will review the results of the RAPID mismatch map, simple (Non-
contrast) CT and the CTA to determine assignment in the specified group. The accuracy of the 
software for identifying the size and location of perfusion and diffusion lesions has been 
established by [CONTACT_702148]; the software received 
FDA 510K clearance for clinical use in 2013. The agreement between local investigators and the 
Imaging Core Lab for identification of the mismatch profile in DEFUSE 215 
CI 0·831·0. Identification of core and penumbral volumes will be done in accordance with the 
procedures followed in DAWN6 and DEFUSE 37 trials. 
 
iSchemaView RAPID ASPECTS:  Inter-rater reliability of ASPECTS score has been shown to be 
fair16. In a recent study, Automated ASPECTS has been shown to have a much higher agreement 
s by [CONTACT_92124]-
certified 17. The 
automated ASPECTS score is included as an investigational tool in the study. ASPECTS for 
patient selection will be determined independently by [CONTACT_702149]. In case of disagreements, ASPECTS scores provided 
by [CONTACT_702150]. In addition, 
the use of perfusion imaging in all patients will also help verify if a large core is present in these 
patients. 
  
 Rationale for including patients with exctracranial ICA occlusion: 
 
Patients with extracranial ICA occlusion, as of now, do not have a proven treatment for 
revascularization and the rates of recanalization achieved by [CONTACT_702151], IV tissue plasminogen activator have been poor18-19. Another issue with these 
patients is the 
SELECT [ADDRESS_953135] angiogram. Including cases with extracranial ICA occlusion on CTA will allow 
for enrollment of these patients. Randomized controlled trials such as ESCAPE and REVASCAT 
reported 40 (12.7%) and 31 (10.3%) patients with extracranial ICA occlusions. EXTEND-IA in 
early window and DEFUSE 3 in late time window also allowed for inclusion of patients with 
extracranial ICA, though did not report the number of patients enrolled with extracranial ICA.  
 Study Question, Aim, and Hypothesis  
Study aims: are to evaluate in acute ischemic stroke patients due to a large vessel occlusion in 
the anterior circulation (MCA M1 and ICA):  
 Primary aim: If thrombectomy plus medical management as compared to medical 
management alone will be efficacious and safe in patients with large core on either CT 
(ASPECTS 3-5) or perfusion imaging (CTP: rCBF<30% or MRP: ADC <620 50cc), treated 
within 0-[ADDRESS_953136] known well. We hypothesize that patients with unfavorable 
profiles (large core) treated with thrombectomy on either imaging modality will have 
significantly better outcomes than large core patients treated with medical 
management only.  
 
 Second aim: The second aim is to look at the correlation of imaging profiles with 
thrombectomy clinical outcomes and treatment effect. It will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_702152] [ADDRESS_953137],2021

A) Evaluate good clinical outcome (90-day mRS 0-2) rates in patients with 
discordant imaging profile (unfavorable CT/favorable perfusion imaging vs 
favorable CT/unfavorable perfusion imaging) treated with thrombectomy.  
 
B) Evaluate the heterogeneity of thrombectomy treatment effect in patients 
with favorable CT/unfavorable perfusion and unfavorable CT/favorable perfusion 
imaging. 
 Methods 
 Study Design   
 
SELECT 2 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized open-label clinical trial evaluating: 1) the 
efficacy and safety of thrombectomy in patients with unfavorable imaging profiles (large core) 
on either CT or perfusion imaging or both treated within [ADDRESS_953138]-known-well; 
and 2) the correlation between CT and CT/MR perfusion imaging profiles and 90 day clinical 
outcomes (good mRS scores, 0-2) in LVO patients treated with thrombectomy within [ADDRESS_953139] 2 trial, patients will 
receive a simple (non-contrast CT), CT angiography and CT/MR Perfusion with mismatch 
determination using automated RAPID software. The physicians will evaluate the CT scans and 
provide ASPECTS score. The CT image will also undergo processing by [CONTACT_702153]. ASPECTS for patient selection will be determined independently by [CONTACT_702154].

 Enrollment and Randomization 
 
All patients who meet the clinical criteria listed above are eligible for SELECT 2 clinical enrollment. 
This includes both patients who are directly admitted to the study site and patients who are 
transferred from an outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The time of enrollment is the time when the informed 
consent is signed by [CONTACT_702155]. All patients or their 
surrogates will provide written informed consent. If a surrogate has provided informed consent, 
an attempt will be made to assess the competence of the patient again at day 1, discharge and 
at every follow-up in-person visit within 90 days of the procedure with the study team, if an in-
person visit is feasible. If the patient is able to provide consent, informed written consent 
procedure will be reattempted, if an in-person visit is feasible.  
 
      Remote consent procedure:  
A remote consent process to prevent delay in treatment is developed and included in the 
SELECT 2 protocol for participating sites that may want to implement such process. This remote 
consenting process will be utilized in cases when the patient himself/herself cannot provide an 
informed consent with the surrogate not being present on enrollment site. The key 
requirements of the process include provision of information regarding the study procedure in 
entirety followed by [CONTACT_702156], and 
SELECT [ADDRESS_953149],2021
31

receive completed ICF document with signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_114252]. An example of such process is 
described below. In places where only a legally authorize representative can consent for a 
research study, appropriate modifications will be made to the process described below. 
 
1. Provision of information regarding the study procedure in entirety followed by 
[CONTACT_702157]: 
1.1. This can be achieved by [CONTACT_702158], a video call or a teleconferencing service. The 
identity of the surrogate should be confirmed by [CONTACT_702159]. 
1.2. The surrogate should be encouraged to ask question. A contact [CONTACT_702160]. 
2. Complete ICF document:  
2.1. The treating center should transmit all pages of ICF document to the surrogate. All 
pages of ICF document, completed by [CONTACT_702161]. 
2.2. Documents with incomplete information, i.e. absence of signature, absence of full 
legal name [CONTACT_702195]-block and 
completed prior to enrollment and subsequent randomization into the study. 
3. Confirmation of the identity:  
The surrogate identity should be confirmed by [CONTACT_702162]. 
4. Transmission of the information through a HIPAA compliant medium:  
4.1. A HIPAA compliant secure medium should be used to transmit the data to the 
surrogate and receive the ICF back from the surrogate. These can include a secure 
institutional email with implemented HIPAA security features, Adobe Sign platform 
SELECT [ADDRESS_953150] received 
before being transferred to the treatment center, the secured email from the Health 
Service Provider (HSP) at remote treatment site or fax machine under direct control 
and access of the HSP for the patient at remote treatment site can be used to 
transmit the information to and from the LAR. 
5. Decreasing the burden of responsibilities from the surrogate as much as possible: 
5.1. The study will ensur that ethe surrogate will receive assistance from the on-site ER 
physician/Nurse/research coordinators to decrease the burden of the consenting 
process including connecting with the surrogate, transferring the study information 
to the surrogate and returning the signed form to the study enrollment site. Use 
video conferencing if possible to establish the contact [CONTACT_702163], provide 
ample opportunity to ask questions and answer all questions in detail. Request 
assistance from on-site healthcare personnel whenever available, provide protocol 
training to them beforehand and consider including them as the study personnel. 
Follow-up with another video call 15-[ADDRESS_953151],2021

2
An example of such a procedure is provided below: 
 Contact [CONTACT_702164]/videoconferencing. 
 Confirm the identity of the surrogate and how he/she is related to the patient. 
 Discuss the study details, including procedures, study device and potential risks and 
benefits. Discuss the ICF and give instructions about where the surrogate needs to sign 
and date/time. The study will ensure that  the surrogate will receive assistance from the 
on-site ER physician/Nurse/research coordinators to decrease the burden of the 
consenting process including connecting with the surrogate, transferring the study 
information to the surrogate and returning the signed form to the study enrollment site. 
 Provide the ICF through a secure medium (Adobe Sign/email/fax). 
 Provide the surrogate with a phone number to call you back in the event that she/he has 
questions. Follow-up with a phone/videoconferencing call after 15-[ADDRESS_953152] any questions or need any help completing and returning the ICF. 
 The surrogate should return the entire, signed and dated ICF back. The ICF is not valid and 
you cannot proceed with study enrollment unless all pages are received and appropriately 
filled out/signed/dated/timed. 
 
After obtaining consent and ensuring all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, randomization 
will be done  in the emergency room prior to treatment using a web-based dynamic 
randomization system. Our randomization algorithm will be accessible to the study 
investigators and staff through a separate web page accessible only through the 
REDCAP database module. C ovariate adaptive randomization will be used to balance the 
distribution of age (<60, 60-69, 70-79, 80-85 years old), presentation NIHSS (6-9, 10-15, 16-20, 
>20), center, clot location (M1, ICA), treatment time window (0-8, 9-16, 17-24 hours from onset 
to randomization time), CTP/MRP core volume (<50cc, 50-100cc, >100cc), presence or absence 
of target mismatch profile ( and hemisphere 
(right, left) between the two treatment groups.

The randomization algorithm we are going to implement is the algorithm developed by [CONTACT_702165] (1975)27, i.e., minimization method. Through this algorithm, the assignment of a new 
patient to a treatment group is determined so as to minimize the differences between the 
groups in terms of these important key baseline variables. Unlike traditional stratified 
randomization, the minimization method works toward minimizing the total imbalance for all 
factors together instead of considering mutually exclusive subgroups, that is, we will not be 
creating these mutually exclusive subgroups during the randomization. Therefore, this 
approach is not restricted by [CONTACT_702142]. Further details about Randomization can be found in Appendix A. 
 
Eligible patients will be randomized into thrombectomy plus medical management vs medical 
management alone at a 1:[ADDRESS_953154],2021

 Endovascular Thrombectomy  
 
 
The goal for femoral artery puncture will be within 45 minutes of randomization; femoral artery 
puncture must occur within 90 minutes of the completion of the qualifying imaging. Patients 
and/or suction (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) 
thrombectomy systems currently cleared by [CONTACT_702166] 24 hours of symptom onset following the published 
instructions for use for these devices. The devices which will be used are FDA-approved stent 
retrievers: the Trevo Retriever, the Solitaire Revascularization Device, EmboTrap 
Revascularization Device and Tigertriever Revascularization Device; and/or the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_702124] (e.g. MicroVention SOFIA Catheter, and the Penumbra 
thrombectomy system) permitted in the study. Please review Appendix C for a list of all 
approved devices. The choice of thrombectomy method, primary approach/technique, whether 
primary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_702120]-retriever with or without aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], will be left up to the 
interventionalist, with any of the FDA-approved devices approved in the study protocol or a 
combination of them (Appendix C). The study database will collect the thrombectomy method, 
and the devices used in the thrombectomy procedure. 
Standard medical therapy, based on current AHA guidelines, will also be provided for all 
patients. Although any cleared neurothrombectomy device (Appendix C) can be used in the 
study, only the Solitaire Revascularization Device and Trevo Retriever are FDA-cleared to be 
indicated as a treatment in acute ischemic stroke patients to reduce their disability from the 
stroke. Individual investigators may use any of these devices or any combination of these 
devices to remove thrombus from the ICA, MCA M1 segment or, if needed, from M2 segments 
of the intracranial circulation. These are all approved anatomic locations for these devices. The 
use of thrombectomy devices should be performed in accordance with the indications for use 
and within the trial protocol. Any deviation from the on-label use of the device outside of the 
SELECT [ADDRESS_953155] 2.  
 
Sites will use local protocols for femoral access, sedation, heparin infusion, monitoring, etc. 
Sites will perform a cervical injection of the involved carotid circulation as a baseline 
 
injection of the involved carotid circulation will also be obtained. Imaging will cover the full 
region of the normal circulation in AP and latera  
the entire venous phase. All brain imaging from stroke onset through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], 
including the MRI, CTP/MRP, and CT, as well as angiographic images obtained for the diagnostic 
and therapeutic portions of the procedure, will be transmitted to the core lab. The use of 
general anesthesia is left to the local investigators but discouraged by [CONTACT_702167].  
In cases of extracranial ICA occlusions, immediate stenting will be discouraged and delayed 
stenting  (beyond 72 hours) will be preferred to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic transformation 
because of requirements of antiplatelet therapy/heparin to prevent re-occlusion. 
 
 Medical Management 
 
Patients randomized to medical management alone will receive standard AHA guideline-
directed medical therapy, which will include  IV thrombolytic therapy available for use 
according to practice guidelines in patients presenting within the first [ADDRESS_953156] study site protocols for these patients. 
 
 Outcome Measures 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Outcome 
 
The primary outcome #1 will be the distribution of mRS scores at 90 days.  The primary 
outcome #2 will be the percentage of good outcome (mRS 0-2) at 90 days. The definition of 
- 15) days, 
measured by a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 0-2. The determination of mRS scores will 
be performed by [CONTACT_702168]-person visit is not possible.  
The shift in the modified Rankin Scale score is better equipped to capture potential 
improvement in the functional outcomes as compared to a binary (dichotomized) outcome with 
intervention. Since the study population is composed of acute stroke patients with significant 
ischemic changes (unfavorable imaging profiles), the potential shift across modified Rankin 
Scale Score categories, not only the functional independence, is of clinical significance. For 
details, a change of mRS score of [ADDRESS_953157] the dichotomized outcome as our second primary outcome.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Outcomes 
 
Secondary outcome measures include: 1) safety as measured by [CONTACT_702169] (sICH) (SITS-MOST)21-point

increase on the NIHSS score within 24 hours due to the stroke itself), mortality and groin (or 
arterial access site) hematomas, infections or any vascular injury caused by [CONTACT_702170], 2) rates of recanalization (complete and partial) using the modified TICI system 
location.  or an 
NIHSS of 0-1 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Imaging Outcomes 
 
Imaging endpoints are:  1) infarct volume on MRI DWI sequence (or CT if MRI not feasible) 24 
hours to 7 days after randomization; 2) lesion growth between the RAPID identified ischemic 
core on baseline imaging and the infarct volume; 3) successful reperfusion defined as DWI 
lesion volume minus Tmax>6 seconds greater than 50%; and 4) the proportion of subjects with 
recanalization of the primary arterial occlusive lesion. The technical efficacy of the endovascular 
procedure will be assessed by a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores of 2b (50% 
to 75% reperfusion), 2c (>75% to 99% reperfusion) or 3 (complete reperfusion).22  
 
 Clinical and Imaging Evaluations  
 
Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline, 24 hours after randomization,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954], 30 days, and 90 days (Table 2). Clinical assessments include the modified  Rankin 
Scale, the NIHSS, and quality of life measure (Neuro-QoL).[ADDRESS_953159],2021

 Site Approval and Monitoring Plan 
Site approval:  The University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Center at Houston is the administration 
center and conducts data monitoring, core image lab reading and statistical analyses. Sites are 
selected for participation based on their experience in conducting clinical trials, their acute 
stroke treatment, and thrombectomy volumes, and only after an extensive discussion and 
vetting process by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_702126], 
prior clinical trial enrollments, well-established research infrastructure, commitment to 
conducting clinical research, fast treatment times and efficient workflow. Sites will have a 
requirement of at least 100 thrombectomy procedures/year. Sites will commit to 
randomization and treatment criteria based on agreed upon contract. Selected sites will have 
access to emergent CT/CT perfusion and/or MR imaging 24/7. Prior to activating a site, we will 
verify that RAPID is functional at the site. Sites will be activated for enrollment after test cases 
processed with RAPID have ensured good quality maps. 
 
Monitoring for imaging quality:  The Imaging Core Lab will monitor image quality throughout 
the study. If significant inadequacies or protocol errors are noted at a site, enrollment will be 
halted. Enrollment will resume after all imaging problems have been resolved and repeat 
dummy runs have been obtained that demonstrate adequate image quality. 
 
Monitoring for bias:  
plan will protect the study from enrollment, randomization, and treatment bias. Sites will 
report their volume of endovascular stroke procedures (within 24 hrs) each month on a 
screening log. If a SELECT [ADDRESS_953165] 
promising subpopulation if futility rule is triggered at the interim (or final) analyses in the 
overall population. This adaptive design has been developed, well-studied, and implemented 
for the DEFUSE 3 studies24. The details and theory of this adaptive enrichment design are 
summarized in Lai et al (2014)25 and Lai et al (2018)26. This adaptive enrichment design is an 
extension of standard group sequential design with an enrichment feature25. It will test for 
efficacy or futility with two interim analyses and a final analysis. This adaptive design was 
chosen because the preliminary data from the SELECT study suggest a potential heterogeneity 
in thrombectomy treatment effect based on the different imaging profiles. By [CONTACT_702176], we expect to reallocate future accrual and study treatment effects only in a 
most promising subpopulation when there is evidence to show that EVT is futile in the overall 
population at interim (or final) analyses. By [CONTACT_702177], a larger number of patients will eventually be enrolled in this 
subgroup for efficacy testing compared to traditional designs.  
 
This design uses the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic (Kullback-Leibler criterion) as 
criteria to identify the subgroup, which has the best chance of showing a benefit from EVT. 
SELECT [ADDRESS_953166] and the sample size of the subgroup. By [CONTACT_702178], the patients are split into six disjoint groups, that is Group 
1 (ASPECTS 3-5 and CTP/MRP core volume <50cc) at early time window 0-12 hours (denoted as 
G1A), Group 1 at late time window 12-24 hours (denoted as G1B), Group 2 (ASPECTS 6-10 and 
CTP/MRP core volume 50cc) at early time window (denoted as G2A), Group 2 at late time 
window (denoted as G2B), Group 3 (ASPECTS 3-5 and CTP/MRP core volume 50cc) at early 
time window (denoted as G3A), and Group 3 at late time window (denoted as G3B). 
Considering a prior assumption that the EVT effect is largest in the patients with good imaging 
profile and treated within the shortest time window, we assume that the highest effect of EVT 
will be observed in G1A. Then the effects get decreased gradually in G1B, G2A, G2B, G3A, and 
the lowest effect will be observed in G3B. According to this adaptive design, when a most 
promising subgroup needs to be selected at the time of interim (or final) analysis, we will 
compare the GLR statistic among five cumulative groups, that is, G1A, G1A+G1B (i.e., Group 1), 
G1A+G1B+G2A, G1A+G1B+G2A+G2B (i.e., Group 1+Group 2), and G1A+G1B+G2A+G2B+G3A.  
Primary analysis:  The primary endpoint is the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin 
Scale (mRS) at day 90.  The null hypothesis will be tested at the interim and final analysis using a 
normal approximation of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (the GLR test). The principle of the 
intention to treat will be applied for the primary analysis. An additional analysis of the primary 
endpoint will be the same rank-based analysis comparing the 90-day mRs distribution between 
treatment groups while stratifying for prognostically important covariates. We will use the 
Generalized Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (CMH) to evaluate whether there is a uniform shift 
on the mRS distribution from one group to the other after stratification. The CMH test will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_702179]. For age, NIHSS, 
treatment time window, and CTP core volume, we will consider them as continuous variables in 
this adjusted analysis.

This distribution corresponds to a standardized effect of 0.34 for the primary analysis.  Based on 
these data, the fixed sample size for a non-adaptive design requires a total of 376 patients 
(188/arm) to have 90% power at an alpha of 5% (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test); We add 
additional [ADDRESS_953168] around 91% power to test for a standardized effect size of 0.34 in the 
overall population (assuming homogeneous EVT effect across six disjoint groups) by [CONTACT_702180] (one-sided) Type I error rate at 2.5%. 
 
Efficacy and futility bound At each analysis (two interim analyses and the final analysis), an 
efficacy bound will be set to decide if the study should be stopped for efficacy while controlling 
the overall (one-sided) Type I error rate at 2.5%.  At each interim analysis, a futility bound will 
be set to decide if the study should continue recruitment in the overall group, shift accrual and 
testing to a subgroup, or stop the trial entirely. When the futility bound is crossed and the 
optimal subgroup is selected, the maximum analyzed sample size will not be fixed but a random 
variable (smaller than the fixed maximum sample size 560). Due to the reduction in the 
maximum number of patients available for analysis at the end of the study, our design allows 
SELECT [ADDRESS_953169] interim analysis (n=200 randomized and completed 90-day follow-up):  The null 
hypothesis is tested in the entire patient cohort: 
1. If neither efficacy nor futility bound is crossed, the trial continues enrollment to the 2nd 
interim analysis. 
2. If the efficacy bound is crossed, the trial stops and efficacy is declared in the overall cohort. 
3. If the futility bound is crossed, the optimal subgroup is selected based on the GLR statistic 
and the null hypothesis is tested in this selected subgroup:  
3.1. If neither bound is crossed, the trial will continue with enrollment limited to the 
selected subgroup 
3.2. If the efficacy bound is crossed, the trial stops and efficacy is declared in the selected 
subgroup 
3.3. If the futility bound is crossed, the trial stops for futility. 
Note: the futility bound is relaxed as described above, based on the expected maximum 
number of patients in the trial at completion (i.e. 560 minus the number of patients already 
enrolled in the groups that will no longer be open for enrollment). 
 
Second interim analysis (n=380 randomized and completed 90 day follow-up):  After the first 
interim analysis, the trial proceeds to this stage under two scenarios: (1) continuing enrollment 
in the overall population (i.e., option 1 above) and (2) limiting enrollment to a selected 
subgroup (i.e., option 3.1 above). When scenario (1) happens, the testing at the 2nd interim 
analysis is identical to the first interim analysis. When scenario (2) happens, the null hypothesis 
is tested in that selected subgroup: 
1. If neither bound is crossed, the trial continues to the final analysis with an enrollment of 
560-380=[ADDRESS_953170],2021

2. If the efficacy bound is crossed, the trial stops and efficacy is declared in the selected 
subgroup 
3. If the futility bound is crossed, the trial stops for futility. 
Final analysis (n=560 randomized and completed 90-day follow-up): After the 2nd interim 
analysis, the trial proceeds to the final stage under two scenarios: (1) continuing enrollment in 
the overall population and (2) limiting enrollment to a selected subgroup.  
When scenario (1) happens, the null is tested in the overall population: 
1. If the efficacy bound is crossed, EVT is declared efficacious in the overall population. 
2. If the efficacy bound is not crossed, the optimal subgroup is selected and the null is tested 
in that group: 
2.1. If the efficacy bound is crossed, EVT is declared efficacious in that subgroup 
2.2. If the efficacy bound is not crossed, EVT will be declared of no benefit. 
When scenario (2) happens, that is, limiting enrollment to a subgroup (either selected at the 1st 
or 2nd interim analyses), the null hypothesis is tested in that selected subgroup only. Efficacy or 
lack thereof will be declared as per options 2.1 and 2.2 above. 
Operating characteristics of the adaptive design : We have conducted simulations (5000 
simulated trials) to evaluate the performance of the adaptive design (max n=560) and compare 
it to a traditional fixed sample-size design (fixed n=560) under various scenarios (see Table 3, 
below).  For the simulations the effect size is expressed as a standardized effect with normal 
approximation, where a standardized effect of 0.[ADDRESS_953171] of EVT (anticipated effect 0.34; see section of Power and sample size 
considerations). We assume that we will observe the number of patients in G1A, G1B, G2A, 
G2B, G3A, G3B with 14%, 6%, 14%, 6%, 42%, and 18%, respectively.

Table 3. Under the null (Scenario #0), the adaptive design controls the total Type 1 error below 2.5%, stops 
early for futility 59.1% of the time, and the average number of randomizations is 426. If the effect is 
uniform across cells at 0.32 (scenario #1), the fixed-sample design is optimal, but the adaptive design 
results in only a small loss of power (from 95.8% to 86.0%), but reduced the expected sample size (from 
560 to 376). We observed similar findings when the effect is uniform across c ells at 0.3 (scenario #2). The 
adaptive design performs much better (higher power and smaller expected sample size) than the fixed -
sample design when the effect size distribution across the subgroups is in accord with the biological 
assumptions (scenarios #3, #4 and #5). If the effect is concentrated only in Group 1 (scenario #6) or Group 
1A (scenario #7), the adaptive design maintains power (70.6% in scenario #6 and 60.5% in scenario #7) 
while the conventional design collapses (21.2% power in scenario #6 a nd 12.8% in scenario #7).

Secondary analyses: Our secondary endpoint is the proportion of patients with mRS 0-2 at day 
90 (indicating functional independence). The difference in the proportions of patients with mRS 
0-[ADDRESS_953174] for the 
variables we used in adaptive randomization program in the logistic regression model. Other

neurological worsening, mortality, groin hematomas, infections or vascular injury, (2) infarct 
volume, lesion growth, successful reperfusion, and recanalization rate, (3) length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210], and (4) discharge disposition. The exploratory analyses on secondary outcomes will 
include descriptive statistics (mean [± standard deviation, SD] or median and interquartile range 
for continuous variables and frequency [percentage] for discrete variables) and appropriate test 
for secondary outcome variables between two groups. For binary outcomes (e.g., sICH, 
neurological worsening, mortality, groin hematomas, infections or vascular injury, successful 
reperfusion, recanalization), Chi-
compare the incidence between two treatment groups for large core patients. We will also 
apply the logistic regression model on these outcomes after adjusting for the variables we used 
in adaptive randomization program. The adjusted odds ratio (OR), as well as 95% confidence 
interval will be reported. For the length of stay, mean ± SD and median (Interquartile range) will 
be calculated for each group. For continuous variables (e.g., the length of stay and infarct 
volume), two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate will be applied to 
compare them between two groups. For discharge disposition, frequency and percentage of 
each disposition will be reported and Chi-
will be applied to compare its distribution between two groups.  
 
Subgroup analyses: Subgroup analyses of the effect of thrombectomy on the primary and 
secondary endpoints will be performed.  Subgroups will be defined based on the stratification 
variables, key demographic factors (such as race and ethnicity), thrombolysis vs. no 
thrombolysis, CTP vs. MRI selection, and witnessed vs. unwitnessed symptom onset, wake-up 
vs non-wake-up stroke, and TICI 0-2a vs. TICI 2b/[ADDRESS_953175],2021

subgroup analysis will be performed in patients who present with extracranial ICA occlusion. 
Also, an additional subgroup analysis will be performed in patients based on thrombolytic 
therapy received. 
 
 Statistical plan for the second aim 
 
The second aim is to compare outcomes in patients with discordant imaging profiles. Good 
outcome rates (90-day mRS 0-2) will be compared between EVT patients with favorable 
CTP/unfavorable CT and EVT patients with unfavorable CT/favorable CTP. Logistic 
regression model will be applied and odds ratio as well as 95% CI will be calculated. If there 
is a significant difference in the outcome, we will evaluate whether any patient 
characteristics could be potential confounders and can explain these differences. 
 
We will also assess the heterogeneity of the treatment effect of thrombectomy comparing 
to medical management between patients with favorable CT/unfavorable CTP and patients 
with unfavorable CT/favorable CTP. We will assess the heterogeneity by [CONTACT_702182] (EVT vs MM) 
and imaging profile (favorable CT/unfavorable CTP vs unfavorable CT/favorable CTP). If the 
interaction term is statistically significant, we will examine patient characteristics and other 
baseline clinical characteristics for possible correlations or confounding factors. 
 
 Poolability analysis across centers 
 
The data from all investigative sites will be pooled based on the assumption of comparable 
clinical aspects such as the common protocol used, adequate monitoring on protocol 
compliance, and the centralized data gathering and validation systems across all study 
sites.

treatment groups and sites. If the interaction term is statistically significant, we will

 Feasibility of enrollment 
The study is planning to involve 30 high volume centers with volumes of 150-200 
thrombectomies/site/year. Based on SELECT data, roughly 20% of the patients have 
unfavorable imaging profiles on either CT or CTP, with ~30 patients/site/year eligible to 
participate in the study. Assuming 50% of the patients consenting to participate in the 
study and at [ADDRESS_953177] in a gradual fashion, the study will complete the 
enrollment target (560 patients) in nearly 2 years.  
 (LTFU) 
All effort is put forth to ensure near complete follow-up, in particular with the assessment of 
the primary outcome (mRS at 90 days), death (mRS=6), and stroke recurrence.  If the primary 
outcome (mRS at 90 days) cannot be assessed in the clinic, it will instead be obtained by [CONTACT_702183] a structured interview.

 Risk Analysis  
Description and analysis of all increased risks to the research subjects: 
 
Potential complications of MRI scan include localized twitching sensation due to the magnetic 
field changes during the scan, anxiety due to claustrophobia and allergic reaction to the 
contrast agent. The allergic reaction may include headache, nausea, rash, hives, nasal 
congestion, sneezing, itching or swelling. If a severe reaction occurs, swelling of the throat, 
chest tightness, or a marked drop in blood pressure may occur. In addition, pain, bleeding, 
bruising, coldness or inflammation at the injection site may occur. Precautions will be taken for 
early detection and rapid treatment if such reactions occur.  
 
Potential complications of CT scan include radiation exposure and allergic reaction to CT 
contrast agents. The iodinated contrast administration may also result in transient and rarely 
permanent renal failure due to nephrotoxicity. Year 1:

Potential complications of endovascular thrombectomy include stroke; new clot in an artery; 
total blockage of an artery; infection and pain in the region of insertion site; lack of blood flow 
to the brain; rupture or puncture of an artery; significant tearing of the vessel wall; bleeding 
requiring blood transfusion; allergic reaction to contrast dye; abnormal low blood pressure 
requiring treatment; temporary closing of the artery (vessel spasm); formation of or 
dislodgments of clots which block the arteries (embolism). In rare circumstances, the procedure 
could result in death. At the puncture site in the groin, a blood clot or other blood vessel injury

serious allergic reaction that could include shortness of breath and swelling, drop in blood 
pressure, and even death. Patients will be closely monitored for these reactions and receive 
prompt treatment to reverse any allergic reactions. 
  Methods to mitigate risks to subjects in the trial  
Methods to mitigate risks to subjects in the trial include the exclusion of subjects with bleeding 
disorders and selection of subjects via neuroimaging to minimize the risk of symptomatic 
intracranial hemorrhage. Computed Tomography (CT) scans will be performed for neurological

Appendix A: Minimization Randomization Algorithm  
Randomization will be done in the emergency room using a web-based dynamic randomization 
system. Covariate adaptive randomization is planned to be developed and implemented to 
balance the distributions of important key baseline variables between the two treatment arms. 
The key variables include age (<60, 60-69, 70-79, 80-85 years old) , presentation NIHSS (6-9, 10-
15, 16-20, >20) , center, clot location (M1, ICA) , treatment time window (0-8, 9-16, 17-24 
hours from onset to randomization time) , CTP/MRP core volume (<50cc, 50-100cc, >100cc), 
15 cc) and hemisphere (right, left) .  
  
The randomization algorithm we are going to implement is the algorithm developed by [CONTACT_702165] (1975), i.e., minimization method. Through this algorithm, the assignment of a new 
patient to a treatment group is determined so as to minimize the differences between the 
groups in terms of these important key baseline variables. Unlike traditional stratified 
randomization, the minimization method works toward minimizing the total imbalance for all 
factors together instead of considering mutually exclusive subgroups, that is, we will not 
creating these mutually exclusive subgroups during the randomization. Therefore, this 
approach is not restricted by [CONTACT_702194].

Details of the minimization randomization algorithm and its implementation 
  
Part I: Specification 
This section provides a general framework for a study with the implementation of the 
minimization algorithm proposed by [CONTACT_75838] (1975). 
 
Assumptions and Notations: 
Assume there are  treatments denoted as  with the randomization ratio as 
 
Assume there are  variables to be balanced in the minimization algorithm denoted as 
. 
For the variable , suppose there are  levels and denote the level of  as . 
 
Algorithm: 
When a new patient enters to the study, denote the observed level of the variable  for this 
patient as ,  
Step 1: Calculate the number of existing patients who are at the same level of the variable  as 
this patient in treatment , denoted as , . So we can obtain 
, . 
 
Step 2: Regarding to the variable , if we assign this patient to treatment , we should have

where  denotes the weight for the variable .  
 
 
Step 3: Find =  and assign the patient to treatment with the highest probability 
among all treatments. 
If we consider variance function for , according to Freedman and White (1978), the total 
imbalance arising when assigning the patient to treatment  can be simplified as follow

Therefore, =

G1A+G1B, G1A+G1B +G2A, G1A+G1B +G2A +G2B, G1A+G1B +G2A +G2B +G3A, respectively.  
The standardized Wilcoxon statistic for patient subgroup is  
 
where,  and  denote the numbers of patients enrolled into the endovascular group and 
medical management group at the th interim analysis, respectively.  
At the th interim analysis, we will terminate the trial and claims efficacy for the endovascular 
group if the following efficacy bound is crossed, that is, 
 
Otherwise, we will proceed to the subgroup selection if the following futility bound is crossed, 
that is, 
 
where 
 
When the above criteria is satisfied, a subgroup   with the largest value of  for  is 
chosen. The future enrollment of the trial will include patients of this subgroup only, while the 
maximum total sample size is still N=560.  
Similar to testing the efficacy and futility in the entire population, at stage , we will terminate 
the trial and claim efficacy for the endovascular group in this selected subgroup if the following 
efficacy bound is crossed 
 
We may also terminate for futility if

If neither the efficacy nor futility bound for the entire population ever occurs, the trial proceeds 
to the final stage and we terminate the trial and claim efficacy for the endovascular group if 
 
Under our design setting (maximum sample size N=560 and conducting interim analysis at 
N=200 and N=380 with type I error at 0.025 and power at 0.9), we obtain 
 for our efficacy and futility boundaries. We assume to be the projected 
treatment effect given the maximum sample size for testing the hypothesis: , 
 using the fixed-sample-size test and is calculated as 
 . Here,  denotes the Rankin score in the medical management group and  denotes 
the Rankin score in the endovascular group. The rationale of this set-up is detailed in section 
3.1 of Lai et al (2014).

1  Study protocol and statistical analysis plan for 24-hour blood pressure measurements and ischemic conditioning ID: 2017-07-0043 Date: September 12, [ADDRESS_922186] their written informed consent and completed a health history questionnaire. Participants were excluded from the study if they were pregnant, had a recent illness, history of diabetes, heart disease, or other cardiovascular problems, recent surgery, or any other medical intervention. Using the medical history questionnaire our participants reported an average of 2 (1) risk factors; including age, family history, smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol, physical inactivity, psychological stress, high-fat diet, and overweight/obesity. All subjects gave their written informed consent prior to study participation, and the ethics committee of the University of [LOCATION_007] at Austin approved all procedures. This study was approved by [CONTACT_681094].gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). After [ADDRESS_922187], endothelial function was assessed using flow-mediated dilation (FMD; index of endothelium-dependent vasodilation) (1). After another [ADDRESS_922188], a second measure of endothelial function was performed. These two measurements were used to establish repeatability of endothelial function within the laboratory. For the data analyses, only the second measurement of FMD was used as the baseline (pre) measure of endothelial function. Following these procedures, the participants were given an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device. After 24-hours, subjects 
[ADDRESS_922189]. Flow-mediated dilatation was measured with an semi-automated diagnostic ultrasound system (UNEXEF38G, UNEX Corporation, Nagoya, Japan) while participants rested in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (2). A blood pressure cuff was placed on the forearm with the proximal edge of the cuff below the subject’s antecubital fossa. The cuff was inflated to 50 mmHg above resting systolic blood pressure for 5 minutes to occlude blood flow. The position of the probe was marked on each participant to ensure subsequent measurements were taken on the same region of the brachial artery. Shear rate (s-1) was calculated by [CONTACT_12801]: 8 x blood flow velocity (m s-1) / internal artery diameter (3).  Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides an insight into blood pressure changes in everyday life and an estimate of the overall blood pressure load exerted on the cardiovascular system over 24 hours (4). Blood pressure recordings were made using a noninvasive ambulatory monitor (Spacelabs [ZIP_CODE], Spacelabs Healthcare Inc., Redlands, Washington, [LOCATION_003]) (5). Participants’ arm circumferences were measured to determine appropriate blood pressure cuff sizes; 24-[ADDRESS_922190]. (OMRON HJ-320, OMRON Healthcare Inc., Hoffman Estates, Illinois, [LOCATION_003]). The cumulative ischemic stimuli from the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was

Data were first tested for the normal distribution. Statistical significance between before and after ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was then evaluated by [CONTACT_19247]’s t-test for paired data. A post-hoc power analysis was conducted using the program G*Power (version [IP_ADDRESS]). Considering the difference between the mean and standard deviation (Pre to Post) with an alpha level of 0.05 for FMD in response to ABPM, the overall sample size of 22 participants in this study achieved an adequate power (>80%). A p value <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

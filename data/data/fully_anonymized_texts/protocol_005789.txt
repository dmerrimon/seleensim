TITLE A phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of liposomal irinotecan in 
combination with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil for patients 
with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma: Big Ten Cancer Research 
Consortium BTCRC-GI15-067 
PHASE II 
OBJECTIVES Primary Objective:  
Determine the disease control rate (DCR) of liposomal irinotecan (nal-
IRI) in combination with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil 
(FOLFOX) for treatment of locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma. 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
1. Describe the objective response rate (ORR) at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 
24 weeks following starting FOLFOX-nal-IRI. 
2. Describe the stable disease rate (SDR) at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 
weeks following starting FOLFOX-nal-IRI. 
3. Describe the proportion of subjects able to undergo surgical resection 
of tumor. 
4. Describe the response of serum CA 19-9 after every 2 cycles (every 4 
weeks) following starting FOLFOX-nal-IRI. 
5. Determine progression-free survival (PFS). 
6. Determine overall survival (OS). 
7. Describe safety and tolerability of FOLFOX-nal-IRI. 
8. Describe the quality of life after every 4 cycles (every 8 weeks) 
following starting FOLFOX-nal-IRI. 
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
 Determine FOLFOX-nal-IRI induced DNA damage/repair and 
apoptosis in biopsied and surgically resected tumor tissues. 
 Determine DNA damage in blood-based biopsies prior to treatment 
and following every 4 cycles (8 weeks) of treatment. 
 Determine the tumor molecular profile prior to initiation of 
chemotherapy and correlate with treatment responses.  
 Determine the metabolic profiles of plasma prior to treatment and 
following every 4 cycles (8 weeks) of treatment. 
 Examine the inter-institutional variability of the overall resectability 
rate. 
STUDY DESIGN This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, clinical study to investigate the 
efficacy and tolerability of a combination of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) 
with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX-nal-IRI) for 
treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC).  
Each subject will be screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_334859], physical examination, performance status, blood tests, 
computed  tomographic  (CT) scans, and electrocardiogram.   Within [ADDRESS_413351] will receive nal-
IRI (irinotecan free base 50 mg/m2), oxaliplatin (60 mg/m2), leucovorin 
(400 mg/m2), and 5-fluorouracil (2,400 mg/m2). 
 
Tumor response/surgical assessment will be evaluated after every [ADDRESS_413352] will undergo surgery 
(at which point he/she would enter survival follow-up). If the tumor 
remains unresectable and there is no tumor progression, each subject will 
be treated up to a total of 12 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI. 
 
Following treatment with 12 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI, if tumor remains 
unresectable, the subjects may receive further treatment (chemotherapy 
using the same regimen or of the treating physician’s choice, or 
chemoradiation therapy) or observation as determined by [CONTACT_099]. 
During the course of treatment, if the subjects develop unacceptable 
toxicity and/or disease progression, the treatment will be discontinued, and 
the subjects will be further managed at the discretion of the treating 
oncologists.

STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS Statistical Analysis and Sample Size Justification: 
The primary endpoint for this study is disease control rate (DCR).   
 
In Loehrer et al. (J Clin Oncol 2011; 29: 4105-4112) 37 patients with 
LAPC treated with gemcitabine alone reported an objective response rate 
(ORR) of 5% and stable disease rate (SDR) of 35%, hence a DCR of 
40%.  In Lakatos et al. (Pathol Oncol Res 2017, 23: 753-759), 32 patients 
with LAPC were treated with a modified FOLFIRNOX protocol reported 
an ORR (partial regression only) of 18.8% and SDR of 56.2%, hence a 
DCR of 75%.  
 
It is assumed that LAPC patients have a DCR of 45% with standard of 
care, whereas LAPC patients will have DCR rate of 75% under the 
protocol in this study. A minimax Simon’s two-stage design will be 
implemented with [ADDRESS_413358] stage. If 5 or fewer 
responses are observed from these 12 patients, then the study will be 
stopped for futility.  Otherwise, an additional 13 patients will be added 
yielding a total sample size of 25 patients.  The study will be considered 
successful if 16 or more responses are observed in the 25 patients. This 
design comprises a type 1 error rate of 5% and a power of 80% when the 
true DCR is 75%.   
 
Therefore, this study seeks to recruit [ADDRESS_413359] stage evaluation.  Assuming approximately 10% of the patients 
would not be evaluable, the target sample size is 28 patients.

12AUG2022 Confidential Page 10 of 49 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Background 
Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, which constitutes more than 80% of exocrine pancreatic 
cancer, has a dismal prognosis. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United 
States and Europe [American Cancer Society 2018; Malvezzi et al, 2013]. Most patients have 
advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Although patients are routinely treated 
with chemotherapy, pancreatic cancer that is not resectable continues to be a highly 
chemotherapy-resistant, lethal disease with poor prognosis. Patients with advanced or metastatic 
disease have a 5-year survival rate of only 2%, while the 1-year survival rate for all stages is 
27% [Siegel et al, 2018]. While early detection of the disease when it is localized and amenable 
to surgical resection is important, improved systemic treatment for disease control is urgently 
needed.   
 
Pancreatic carcinoma is considered locally advanced and unresectable due to vascular 
involvement as defined by [CONTACT_68015] (NCCN) Guideline 
(Version 1.2018). The criteria defining resectability depend on the location of the tumor in the 
pancreas and its involvement of its surrounding arteries and veins and they are described as 
follows:  Carcinoma located in the head or uncinated process of pancreas are considered 
unresectable if (i) tumor encases (>180o involvement) of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or 
celiac axis (CA); (ii) superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or portal vein (PV) becomes 
unreconstructible due to tumor involvement or occlusion (caused by [CONTACT_334864]); (iii) tumor is in contact [CONTACT_334865].  
On the other hand, carcinoma located in the body or tail of pancreas are considered unresectable 
if (i) tumor encases (>180o involvement) of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or celiac axis 
(CA); (ii) tumor is in contact [CONTACT_334866]; (iii) superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or portal 
vein (PV) becomes unreconstructible due to tumor involvement or occlusion (caused by [CONTACT_334867]). 
 
For patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC), treatment is generally 
palliative unless the tumor is down-staged and become resectable in rare instances. For the 
majority of patients with LAPC, the tumor remains unresectable and the prognosis is poor, with a 
median survival of [ADDRESS_413364] not 
progressed outside the pancreas.  If there is significant down-sizing of tumors (and clearing of 
vascular involvement in particular), patients may undergo surgical resection of tumor; 
alternatively, if tumor remains unresectable and without tumor progression, they may receive 
further chemotherapy or undergo observation.   
 
There is no clearly accepted standard first-line chemotherapy for treatment of LAPC.  The 
chemotherapeutic agents for patients with LAPC are typi[INVESTIGATOR_334848].  The commonly used drugs include 
5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin/irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX), nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine, or 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-067  
12AUG2022 Confidential Page 11 of 49 gemcitabine [Balaban et al. 2016]. Several studies have shown that FOLFIRINOX has been used 
for patients with borderline resectable PC (BRPC) or LAPC with variable efficacy [reviewed by 
[CONTACT_334868]. 2015 and by [CONTACT_334869]., 2016].  For patients with BRPC treated with 
FOLFIRINOX, the resection rate and R0 rate are relatively high, but the majority of LAPC 
remains unresectable following chemotherapy [Hosein et al. 2012; Liu Mondo et al. 2013; Boone 
et al, 2013; Ferrone et al, 2015; Blazer et al. 2015]. Moreover, FOLFIRINOX may not be 
considered for patients with suboptimal performance status, and this chemotherapy is associated 
with intolerable grade 3 or 4 toxicities that lead to reduction of dosage or discontinuation of 
treatment. Thus, systemic therapy that improves tumor response and resection rate with tolerable 
toxicity is urgently needed for patients with LAPC. 
1.3 Liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) 
This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of a combination of liposomal irinotecan 
(nal-IRI) with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil in patients with locally advanced 
pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC).   
 
Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor used as an anti-neoplastic agent and has shown 
significant activity in a variety of tumor types. Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection (Campto® or 
Camptosar®) is approved in Asia, Europe, and North America for the treatment of colorectal, 
lung, gastric, cervical, ovarian, and breast cancers. However, at high dosages, irinotecan causes 
severe diarrhea and myelosuppression, which are recognized as dose-limiting toxicities and 
therefore limits the use of more aggressive irinotecan therapy.  
 
Onivyde® (irinotecan liposome injection) is a liposomal formulation of irinotecan designed to 
maintain or increase its anti-tumor efficacy. Irinotecan liposome injection employs a novel intra-
liposomal drug stabilization technology for encapsulation of irinotecan into long- circulating 
liposome-based nanoparticles with high drug load and high in vivo stability.  
 
Irinotecan liposome injection was approved as Onivyde® in the [LOCATION_002] in October 2015, in 
combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. 
Onivyde® is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

how well the drug substance is retained within the liposome. This property is controlled by [CONTACT_941]

12AUG2022 Confidential Page 12 of 49 amount of drug substance within each liposome controls the amount of lipid which is delivered 
along with the drug substance and is controlled by [CONTACT_334870].  
 
Irinotecan liposome injection is supplied as a sterile solution containing 4.3 mg/ml of irinotecan 
on the free base basis (equivalent to 5.0 mg/ml of irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate) 
encapsulated in liposomes. The drug product is a sterile, white to slightly yellow opaque isotonic 
liposomal dispersion for intravenous infusion. Each vial has a nominal fill volume of [ADDRESS_413366] be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection or Normal Saline (0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection) to a suitable volume for infusion. The solution for infusion (MM- 398 
Injection and its admixtures) must not be frozen. Freezing will disrupt the liposome structure and 
result in the release of free irinotecan. Please see the clinical protocol for instructions on 
irinotecan liposome injection storage conditions, shelf life, and product administration. 
  
Irinotecan liposome injection has been tested for compatibility with limited materials, and no 
compatibility issues have been identified.  
 
The only component of biological origin in irinotecan liposome injection is cholesterol, which is 
derived from sheep wool. Manufacture of irinotecan liposome injection uses cholesterol 
exclusively derived from sheep in New Zealand, where BSE/TSE has not been reported. The 
irinotecan liposome injection cGMP manufacturing process extensively controls for reduction 
and minimization of bioburden throughout production. The drug product is sterile filtered prior 
to aseptic filling into vials.  
 
Note that irinotecan liposome injection concentration and dosing may be expressed in different 
ways in different regions, as described in more detail in the investigator brochure. The 
investigator brochure presents the irinotecan liposome injection concentration and dosing in the 
historically accepted format using the salt based concentration/strength unless indicated 
otherwise. It also describes the current approach to concentration and dosing expressions used in 
various regions.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_413367], gastric, 
colon, cervical, brain, pancreatic, and lung cancers were used to evaluate the activity of 
intravenous (IV) irinotecan liposome injection during research and development. Irinotecan 
liposome injection yielded improved in vivo tumor efficacy not only compared with equal dosing 
levels of non-liposomal irinotecan, but also in SN-38 exposure-matched studies, where weekly 
dosing of irinotecan liposome injection at 10 mg/kg showed higher efficacy than 50 mg/kg of 
unencapsulated irinotecan. Some of the studies showed that irinotecan liposome injection is as 
much as ~[ADDRESS_413368] and hematologic system were identified as key target organs of toxicity 
consistent with the effects of non-liposomal irinotecan. Dose-dependent reversibility of 
toxicological effects was observed. There were no significant findings in the safety

cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_334849]. Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, 
which was noted in rat studies after administration of non-liposomal irinotecan at 75 mg/kg, was 
not observed after liposomal administration even at 190 mg/kg. Toxicologic data for irinotecan 
liposome injection have not identified further toxicity to that determined for non-liposomal 
irinotecan. In the 18-week repeat-dose toxicity studies, the irinotecan liposome injection NOAEL 
for rats and dogs is 30 mg/kg (180 mg/m2) and 9 mg/kg (180 mg/m2), respectively. In dogs, the 
highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) for irinotecan liposome injection is estimated to be 
between 9 and 15 mg/kg (180-300 mg/m2).  
 
The results of pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs after a single infusion of irinotecan 
liposome injection indicated a longer elimination half-life and lower clearance for the 
encapsulated active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), irinotecan, than after infusion of non- 
liposomal irinotecan. At comparable doses, C max was higher with irinotecan liposome injection, 
while the volume of distribution was lower. Mean residence time (MRT) was longer for 
irinotecan liposome injection, and overall exposure was higher. During systemic circulation, 
liposomal encapsulation rates of >95% were maintained. In general, the tissues of rats that 
received irinotecan liposome injection contained similar maximum concentrations of the API [INVESTIGATOR_334850], but these levels were reached later and remained higher for longer than tissue

In animal pharmacokinetics studies, once irinotecan was released from irinotecan liposome 
injection liposomes, the metabolic conversion of irinotecan to SN-[ADDRESS_413369] been conducted in the North America, 
Europe, South America, Australia and Asia. As of 20 September 2017, irinotecan liposome 
injection has been evaluated in 10 sponsor clinical studies; 3 are ongoing (Studies MM-398- 01-
01-02, MM-398-07-02-03, and 331501). Irinotecan liposome injection has also been evaluated in 
7 investigator-sponsored clinical studies, of which 4 are ongoing ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] CED, 
CC#[ZIP_CODE], SPOC 2012-001 and NCI-9914). In these studies, evaluations included patients with 
solid tumors, including cervical cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer. 
Disease areas currently being studied include glioma (convection-enhanced local delivery), 
breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and several pediatric solid tumors, including 
Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and osteosarcoma.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety 
The safety data for irinotecan liposome injection are described in detail in the investigator 
brochure. The most common adverse reactions (≥20 %) considered to be related to treatment 
observed in clinical trials of irinotecan liposome injection in combination with 5-fluorouracil and 
leucovorin, are: diarrhea, fatigue/asthenia, vomiting, nausea, decreased appetite, stomatitis, and 
pyrexia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (≥10% Grade 3 or 4) were lymphopenia and 
neutropenia (ONIVYDE® USPI). The most common serious adverse reactions (≥2%) of 
irinotecan liposome injection were diarrhea, vomiting, febrile neutropenia, nausea, pyrexia, 
sepsis, dehydration, septic shock, pneumonia, acute renal failure and thrombocytopenia

The safety of irinotecan liposome injection, a liposomal formulation of irinotecan, may be 
indirectly compared with the safety of irinotecan, primarily based on a qualitative comparison of 
adverse reactions reported in the Camptosar® US label for irinotecan and in the US Product 
Label for ONIVYDE®. The most common adverse reactions of irinotecan and irinotecan 
liposome injection are similar and are mainly gastrointestinal events and myelosuppression.  
 
Certain known adverse reactions of irinotecan, including anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction, 
interstitial lung disease-like pulmonary toxicity, and acute pancreatitis, have not been observed 
with irinotecan liposome injection to date. This could be due to the limited cumulative patient 
exposure to date of irinotecan liposome injection, or the use of appropriate premedication and 
early recognition and treatment of expected adverse events. There is insufficient evidence to 
know whether these known adverse reactions of irinotecan will eventually be associated with 
irinotecan liposome injection.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Safety Data from Ongoing MM-398-07-02-03 Study 
A Randomized, Open-label Phase 2 Study of Nanoliposomal Irinotecan (nal-IRI)-containing 
Regimens versus nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine in Patients with Previously Untreated, 
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  
 
This study is an open-label, phase II study to assess the safety, dose-limiting toxicities (Part 1A 
only), tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of irinotecan liposome injection in combination with 
oxaliplatin+5-FU/LV in subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have not 
received prior systemic anti-tumor therapy. The study comprises an initial dose exploration (Part 
1A) followed by [CONTACT_216708] (Part 1B ongoing in the extension phase) of the irinotecan 
liposome injection+ oxaliplatin+5-FU/LV regimen. 
 
For the 56 subjects treated, all (100.0%) had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). There 
were nine TEAEs that were defined as Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) that were reported by 
[CONTACT_334871] (diarrhea, n=2; vomiting, anal fissure, anal 
inflammation, proctalgia, neutropenic infection, neutropenic sepsis, and febrile neutropenia, all 
n=1), including one subject treated in Part 1A- Cohort B who was included in the pooled analysis 
(febrile neutropenia) 
 
Treatment-related TEAEs Grade 3 or higher were reported by 41 of 56 subjects, including 22 
subjects from the pooled analysis of 32 subjects treated with irinotecan liposome injection 50 
mg/m2+LV 400 mg/m2+5-FU 2400 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 60 mg/m2. The TEAEs included: 
neutropenia, n=10; febrile neutropenia, hypokalemia, both n=4; diarrhea, nausea, both n=3; 
anemia, vomiting, both n=2, with no reported Grade 3 or higher fatigue or peripheral neuropathy. 
 
SAEs were reported by 34 of the 56 treated subjects, including 17 of the 32 subjects in the 
pooled analysis, with 23 subjects reporting treatment-related SAEs. In the pooled analysis, 10 of 
the 32 subjects had treatment-related SAEs: nausea, febrile neutropenia, both n=3; diarrhea, 
vomiting, both n=2; colitis, enterocolitis, stomatitis, anemia, pneumonia, and pyrexia, all n=1. At 
the data cut-off there were no treatment-related TEAEs leading to death.

[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy 
The efficacy data for irinotecan liposome injection are described in detail in the investigator 
brochure. The efficacy profile of treatment with irinotecan liposome injection, in combination 
with 5- fluorouracil and leucovorin, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously 
treated with gemcitabine is derived primarily from the single phase 3 study (Study Number MM 
398- 07-03-01, NAPOLI-1), which was initiated following the promising results of a single-arm, 
phase 2 study of irinotecan liposome injection as a single-agent in the same patient population 
(Study PEP0208).  
 
Overall in Study PEP0208, 30/40 (75.0%) patients in the Per Protocol population achieved the 3-
month survival primary efficacy endpoint (95% CI: 58.8-87.5%) while being treated with 
irinotecan liposome injection. In addition, 6-month survival was achieved by 17/40 (42.5%) 
patients and 12-month survival by 10/40 (25.0%) patients.  
 
The basis for the US marketing authorization application of irinotecan liposome injection, in 
combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer 
previously treated with gemcitabine, was the NAPOLI-1 study. The NAPOLI-1 study tested the 
clinical efficacy and safety of two potentially new treatment options, irinotecan liposome 
injection monotherapy and irinotecan liposome injection+5FU/LV combination therapy, in 
pairwise comparison to an active control arm, consisting of 5-FU and leucovorin.  
 
The baseline characteristics of the patient population in the study were considered representative 
of a pretreated, metastatic pancreatic cancer population, similar to that found in clinical practice, 
and were balanced across treatment groups. Of 577 screened, 417 patients were randomized and 
included in the ITT population.  
 
The combination of irinotecan liposome injection+5-FU/LV achieved a median overall survival 
(OS) of 6.1 months compared to 4.2 months for the control arm of 5-FU/LV alone. The 
NAPOLI-1 study demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant (p=0.012) 
superiority of OS in patients receiving the irinotecan liposome injection+5-FU/LV combination 
over the 5-FU/LV control arm. Additionally, sensitivity analyses supported this primary OS 
analysis of the irinotecan liposome injection+5-FU/LV combination. The OS benefit was present 
(or could not be ruled out) in all pre-specified subgroups.  
 
Among the secondary endpoints, PFS, ORR, TTF and CA 19-9 response rate demonstrated 
statistically significant superiority for the irinotecan liposome injection+5-FU/LV combination 
over the 5-FU/LV control arm.  
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-[ADDRESS_413370] documented the therapeutic benefits of encapsulated liposome anti-cancer 
drugs such as doxorubicin and vincristine [Duggan et al, 2011; Pathak et al, 2014]. Irinotecan is 
a member of the camptothecin class of topoisomerase I (TOPO1) inhibitors, whose principal 
mechanism of action leading to cell death is through DNA damage after replication-fork 
collisions with transiently trapped drug-TOPO1-DNA cleavage complexes, thus emphasizing the 
length of drug exposure as an important driver for cytotoxicity of camptothecins [Pommier, 
2006; Pommier, 2009] . It has shown significant activity in a variety of tumor types. Promising 
response rates have been observed in many malignancies such as colorectal, non-small cell lung, 
and small cell lung cancers. However, at higher dosage, irinotecan causes severe diarrhea and 
myelosuppression, which are recognized as the dose-limiting toxicities and limit the use of more 
aggressive irinotecan therapy.  
 
Irinotecan liposome injection is a novel liposomal formulation of irinotecan, designed to 
maintain or increase its anti-tumor efficacy. Irinotecan liposome injection has also been known 
as PEP02, MM-398, and nal-IRI. Irinotecan liposome injection has been studied in patients with 
solid tumors, including cervical cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer. 
Disease areas currently being studied by [CONTACT_334872], breast cancer, colorectal cancer and pediatric solid  tumors, including Ewing's sarcoma, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. Disease areas currently being studied in 
investigator-sponsored clinical studies include pancreatic cancer, glioma (intravenous and 
convection-enhanced local delivery) and breast cancer.  
 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) has been 
shown to increase and prolong intratumoral levels of both irinotecan and its active metabolite 
SN-38 (Wang-Gillam et al. Lancet 2016; 387: 545-557).  These data suggest a therapeutic 
advantage of nal-IRI over the conventionally used irinotecan.  Currently, the combination of nal-
IRI with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin is a second line treatment approved by [CONTACT_334873]-
paclitaxel and gemcitabine.  Whether nal-IRI in combination with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and 
leucovorin improves tumor response and resection rate for patients with LAPC has not been 
investigated.  This proposed study is aimed to test the hypothesis that combination of nal-IRI 
with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX-nal-IRI) is a tolerable systemic 
therapy that improves tumor response, resection rate, and quality of life for patients with LAPC .

considered registered when an ‘On Study’ date is entered into the EDC system. Subjects must be 
registered prior to starting protocol therapy and begin therapy within 5 business days of 
registration.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN 
This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, clinical study to investigate the efficacy and 
tolerability of a combination of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 
5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX-nal-IRI) for treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic 
carcinoma (LAPC).  Each subject will be screened for eligibility and if eligible will be registered 
to the study. Within [ADDRESS_413376] a central venous 
access device placed and then start treatment. 
 
Subjects will receive FOLFOX-nal-IRI every 2 weeks as described below. Tumor 
response/surgical assessment will be evaluated after every [ADDRESS_413377] should be removed from study treatment and undergo surgery (at which point he/she 
would enter survival follow-up). If the tumor remains unresectable and there is no tumor 
progression, each subject will be treated up to a total of [ADDRESS_413378] would still be 
considered on study. 
 
Following treatment with 12 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI (for those patients not offered 
radiotherapy), if the tumor remains unresectable, the subjects may receive further treatment 
(chemotherapy using the same regimen or of the treating physician’s choice, or chemoradiation 
therapy) or observation as determined by [CONTACT_1963].  Regardless of choice at this 
point, patients should be followed for survival.

Transfusion of blood products and administration of myeloid growth factors may be considered 
for chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and 
neutropenia as indicated by [CONTACT_334884], laboratory results, and as determined by [CONTACT_1275]. 
 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_413382] dose of trial treatment should be 
recorded only if associated with a serious adverse event (SAE) as defined in Section 11.1.2 and if 
the SAE meets the reporting criteria in Section 11.2.2. 
 
Medications administered during a procedure (anesthetics, etc.) will not be collected as 
concomitant medications. However, the procedure itself should be recorded on the adverse event 
page of the EDC. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_413383] substantially reduced 
exposure to irinotecan (AUC reduction by 12% with St John’s wort, 57%-79% with phenytoin, 
phenobarbital, or carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) and SN-38 (AUC reduction by 42% with St John’s wort, 36%-
92% with phenytoin phenobarbital, or carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). Therefore, co-administration of 
irinotecan liposome injection with inducers of CYP3A4 may reduce systemic exposure of 
irinotecan liposome injection. 
 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and UGT1A1 inhibitors 
Patients receiving concomitant non-liposomal irinotecan and ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and 
UGT1A1 inhibitor, have increased SN-38 exposure by 109%. Therefore, co-administration of 
irinotecan liposome injection with other inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. grapefruit juice, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telaprevir, voriconazole) may increase systemic exposure of irinotecan liposome injection. Based 
on the drug interaction of non-liposomal irinotecan and ketoconazole, co-administration of 
irinotecan liposome injection with other inhibitors of UGT1A1 (e.g. atazanavir, gemfibrozil, 
indinavir) may also increase systemic exposure of irinotecan liposome injection. 
 
The prohibited medications are listed in Table 1 in the protocol appendix. 
5.4 Supportive Care 
Drugs-associated toxicities may require symptomatic management and may be administered at 
the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981] . For 
example, irinotecan liposome injection can cause life-threatening myelosuppression, 
neutropenia, and diarrhea. The complications of neutropenia such as neutropenic fever and 
neutropenic sepsis should be managed promptly with antibiotics; granulocyte-colony stimulating 
factor (G-CSF) may be used to manage neutropenia at the investigator’s discretion. Early-onset 
diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan) may be prevented by [CONTACT_094]-
medication with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_334851]. Late diarrhea 
(generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan) should be treated 
promptly with loperamide, fluid and electrolyte replacement for dehydration, and antibiotics if 
ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia develops. In case of severe hypersensitivity reactions, acute 
infusion reactions (rash, urticarial, periorbital edema, pruritis), or interstitial lung disease 
(dyspnea, cough, fever), irinotecan liposome injection should be discontinued, and the symptoms 
should be managed according to existing standard guidelines.

and staging (pathology report and staging documentation [TNM staging]), smoking history questionnaire and trial awareness question, prior anti-
cancer treatment including medications, [chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, etc.], radiation and surgery. 
2: Vital signs to include blood pressure, weight, and height (screening only) and ECOG performance status 
3: Assessment of quality of life: prior to treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1 then after every 4 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI (every 8 weeks) and at the 
safety follow up visit. If a cycle is delayed, QOL assessment should also be delayed. Assessment will be done using the EORTC-QLQ-C30. 
4: CMP to include sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen; liver function tests (LFTs) to include AST, ALT, total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase. CBC with differential and platelet count to include WBC, Hgb, ANC and platelet count. 
5: CA19-9 will be drawn prior to treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1 then after every 2 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI (that is, every 4 weeks) and at the 
safety follow up visit. If a cycle is delayed, CA19-9 should also be delayed. 
6: For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): serum βhCG, within [ADDRESS_413396] within 72 hours of Cycle 1 Day 1.  
7: Tumor response will be performed at screening then after every 4 cycles (every 8 weeks); tumor imaging to be done at treatment discontinuation 
at discretion of investigator. CT pancreas triple phase with pelvis and chest CT may replace the CT chest-abdomen-pelvis if clinically indicated. 
Baseline bone scan will be obtained if there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_334853].  If bone scan is positive at baseline, subjects will be 
excluded from the study. A screening MRI of brain should be performed to evaluate for the presence of brain metastases as clinically indicated.  A 
CT scan of the brain may be done if MRI is contraindicated. A ±7-day window will apply to all imaging. 
8: If prior genetic sequencing results were performed as per standard of care, they will be submitted at C1D1. See also Section 8.1. If the subject 
undergoes surgical resection, tissue will be required from that procedure. All specimens will be used for biospecimen-based research.   
9: Research Blood Samples will be collected prior to treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1 then after every 2 cycles (every 4 weeks) starting at Cycle 3 Day 
1 of FOLFOX-nal-IRI and at the safety follow up visit. These samples will be used for correlative testing as described in Section 8. See CLM for 
collection, processing, labeling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
10: Whole blood for banking is to be collected at Pre-Treatment Cycle 1 Day 1. See CLM for collection, processing, labeling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3930]. 
11: Submission of unstained slides for banking from an archived FFPE tumor block (if available). See CLM for collection, labeling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3930]. 
12: Serum and plasma for banking are to be collected at Pre-Treatment Cycle 1 Day 1 and at the 30-Day Safety Follow up visit. See CLM for 
collection, labeling, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
13: If screening (baseline) labs were performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 of treatment, these do not need to be repeated.   
14: When subjects permanently stop study treatment for whatever reason, a safety follow-up visit will occur 30 days (+7 days) after the last dose 
of treatment or before the initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever comes first.  
15: Subjects without documented disease progression will be followed for disease progression every [ADDRESS_413397] to follow up. This follow up may be accomplished via phone call, email, telehealth, or communication with a local physician. 
16: All CT/MRI images obtained throughout the study will be submitted for central analysis at the end of the study.

12AUG2022 Confidential Page 29 of 49 7.1 Safety Follow-up Evaluations 
A safety follow-up visit should occur when subjects permanently stop study treatment for 
whatever reason (toxicity, progression, or at discretion of site investigator) and should be 
performed 30 days (+7 days) after the last dose of treatment or before the initiation of a new anti-
cancer treatment, whichever comes first. Subjects who have an ongoing ≥ grade 2 or serious AE 
(SAE) at this visit will continue to be followed until the AE resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline, is 
deemed clinically insignificant, and/or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever is 
earlier. 
7.[ADDRESS_413398] archival tissue available, a new biopsy is recommended but 
is not mandatory. In particular, markers such as BRCA1, BRAC2, TP53, CDKN2A, and KRAS 
will be noted in the database. Results of tumor molecular profiling may be used for correlation 
with tumor response to treatment.  
8.2 Tissue from Surgical Resection  
For subjects that undergo surgical resection, a sample of this tissue is required. This sample may 
be analyzed for molecular profiling including expression of biomarkers and somatic mutations 
by [CONTACT_11398]-generation sequencing. Results of tumor molecular profiling may be used for correlation 
with tumor response to treatment. 
8.3 Peripheral Blood 
Peripheral blood collection will occur prior to treatment on cycle 1, day 1, then after every 2 
cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI (that is, every 4 weeks) and at the safety follow up visit. Plasma will 
be processed from the peripheral blood for future metabolite profiling and circulating tumor 
DNA analysis.

9. CRITERIA FOR DISEASE EVALUATION 
9.[ADDRESS_413403] one dimension (longest 
diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_413404] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_413405] scan, or >[ADDRESS_413406] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters). 
9.1.[ADDRESS_413407] be >[ADDRESS_413408] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
9.2 Non-measurable Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-067  
12AUG2022 Confidential Page 31 of 49 disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pneumonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable. 
 
NOTE:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
9.3 Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease. 
9.4 Non-target Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 
target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
9.5 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
NOTE: In addition to the information below, also see section 4.3.2 in the international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee, version 
1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228-247) for special notes on the assessment of target lesions.  
 
Complete 
Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in 
short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response 
(PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive 
Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-067  
12AUG2022 Confidential Page 32 of 49 appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
Stable Disease 
(SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study  
9.6 Evaluation of Non-target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis) 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a subject to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/ Non-PD Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits 
Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_334854], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_16170].

Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium   Clinical Study Protocol 
    BTCRC-GI15-067  
12AUG2022 Confidential Page 33 of 49  
Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that 
the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete response 
status. 
9.8 Definitions for Response Evaluation – RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_413409] 1.1, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of 
treatment). 
9.8.4 Disease Control Rate 
The disease control rate is the proportion of all subjects with stable disease (SD) for 8 weeks, or 
partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) according to RECIST 1.1, from the start of 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment). 
 
10. DRUG INFORMATION 
10.1 Liposomal Irinotecan (nal-IRI) 
Please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional information 
regarding this drug.  
 
The irinotecan liposome injection drug product contains the drug substance irinotecan in the 
amount equivalent to 5 mg/mL of irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate. The drug product 
liposome is a small unilamellar lipid bilayer vesicle, approximately 110 nm in diameter, that 
encapsulates an aqueous space which contains irinotecan in a gelated or precipi[INVESTIGATOR_334855], as the 
sucrosofate salt. The liposome carriers are composed of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3- 
phosphocholine (DSPC), 6.81 mg/mL; cholesterol, 2.22 mg/mL; and methoxy-terminated 
polyethylene glycol (MW 2000)-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (MPEG-2000-DSPE), 0.12 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium   Clinical Study Protocol

12AUG2022 Confidential Page 34 of 49 mg/mL. Each mL also contains 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_9482]-1-yl] ethanesulfonic acid 
(HEPES) as a buffer, 4.05 mg/mL; sodium chloride as isotonicity reagent, 8.42 mg/mL; and 
sucrose octasulfate as the drug trappi[INVESTIGATOR_231505], 0.9 mg/mL. The solution is buffered at pH 7.25. 
In the vialed product, greater than 98% of the drug is encapsulated in the liposome carrier.  
Irinotecan liposome injection is supplied as a sterile solution containing 4.3 mg/ml of irinotecan 
free base encapsulated in liposomes. The appearance of irinotecan liposome injection is white to 
slightly yellow opaque liquid. 
10.1.1 Supplier/How Supplied 
Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals will supply Irinotecan liposome injection at no charge to subjects 
participating in this clinical trial.  
 
The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps to maintain appropriate 
records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of 
investigational product in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulations. 
10.1.2 Preparation  
Irinotecan liposome injection is supplied as a sterile solution containing 4.3 mg/ml of irinotecan 
on the free base basis (equivalent to 5.0 mg/ml of irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate) 
encapsulated in liposomes. Prior to administration, irinotecan liposome injection drug product 
must be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection or Normal Saline to a suitable volume for infusion. 
Irinotecan liposome injection and admixtures of irinotecan liposome injection must not be 
frozen, as freezing temperature may disrupt the liposome structure in the drug product and lead 
to the release of free irinotecan.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_413410] be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection or Normal Saline (0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection) to a suitable volume for infusion. The solution for infusion 
(irinotecan liposome injection and its admixtures) must not be frozen. Freezing will disrupt the 
liposome structure and result in the release of free irinotecan. Because of the potential for 
microbial contamination during dilution, the solution for infusion should be used immediately, 
but may be stored at room temperature (15º to 30ºC) for up to 4 hours prior to the start of the 
infusion. If necessary, the solution for infusion may be refrigerated (2º to 8ºC) for no more than

11. ADVERSE EVENTS 
11.1 Definitions 
11.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence whether or not considered related to the study drug 
that appears to change in intensity during the course of the study. The following are examples of 
AEs:  
 Unintended or unfavorable sign or symptom 
 A disease temporally associated with participation in the protocol 
 An intercurrent illness or injury that impairs the well-being of the subject 
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_334856] (e.g., surgical insertion of 
central line) should not be recorded as an AE. Disease progression should not be recorded as an 
AE, unless it is attributable to the study regimen by [CONTACT_6962]. 
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is an adverse event that: 
 Results in death. NOTE: Death due to disease progression should not be reported as a 
SAE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_3987](s) 
 Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] >24 hours or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. NOTE: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_334857], central line insertion, metastasis interventional 
therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious 
adverse events. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention (e.g., 
medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above). Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 Pregnancy  
 Overdose

European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Core 
Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30). 
12.2.3 Definition of Exploratory Endpoints 
 Effect of FOLFOX-nal-IRI DNA damage and apoptosis, in biopsied and surgically 
resected tumor tissue specimens (for subjects who undergo surgical resection of tumors), 
as determined by [CONTACT_9064] (or ELISA) for DNA damage/repair 
(phosphorylated histone H2AX, ɣH2AX), DNA double strand damage response (p53 
binding protein, 53BP1), apoptosis (activated caspase 8 and caspase 3). 
 Effect of treatment-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes 
(PBLs) before treatment and following every 4 cycles (8 weeks) of treatment, as 
determined by ɣH2AX and 53BP1, and serum biomarkers for apoptosis. 
 Molecular profiling as determined by [CONTACT_334890] 
(including expression level of topoisomerase 1, thymidine synthetase, ERCC1) and next-

12.[ADDRESS_413417] a DCR of 45% with standard of care, whereas LAPC 
patients will have DCR rate of 75% under the protocol in this study. A minimax Simon’s two-
stage design will be implemented with [ADDRESS_413418] stage. If 5 or fewer 
responses are observed from these 12 patients, then the study will be stopped for futility. 
Otherwise, an additional 13 patients will be added yielding a total sample size of 25 patients. The 
study will be considered successful if 16 or more responses are observed in the 25 patients. This 
design comprises a type 1 error rate of 5% and a power of 80% when the true DCR is 75%.   
 
Therefore, this study seeks to recruit [ADDRESS_413419] stage 
evaluation.  Assuming approximately 10% of the patients would not be evaluable, the target 
sample size is [ADDRESS_413420] one dose of treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for 
toxicity. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events

12AUG2022 Confidential Page 43 of 49 12.6 Data Analysis Plans 
12.6.1 Analysis Plans for Primary Objective 
The primary endpoint for this study is disease control rate (DCR).   
 
In the study by [CONTACT_334891]., 37 patients with LAPC treated with gemcitabine alone reported 
an objective response rate (ORR) of 5% and stable disease rate (SDR) of 35%, hence a DCR of 
40%.  As reported by [CONTACT_334892]., 32 patients with LAPC were treated with a modified 
FOLFIRNOX protocol reported an ORR (partial regression only) of 18.8% and SDR of 56.2%, 
hence a DCR of 75%. For determining the sample size for this one-arm clinical trial, we will 
consider the study successful if the DCR is statistically significant from 45%. 
12.6.2 Analysis Plans for Secondary Objectives 
The Secondary Objectives will be analyzed as described in the section 12.2.2, Definition of 
Secondary Endpoints. 
12.7 Interim Analysis/Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_47411] 
A single interim analysis for futility will take place when the 12th subject has completed 6 
months of follow-up. The proportion of subjects that is tumor progression-free at 6 months will 
be assessed along with other efficacy and safety data in making the determination if the study 
should continue. If 5 or fewer responses are observed from these 12 patients, then the study will 
be stopped for futility. Otherwise, an additional 13 patients will be added yielding a total sample 
size of 25 patients. Accrual will continue during the interim analysis. Recruitment will be halted 
if futility is determined. 
 
13. TRIAL MANAGEMENT

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Phase I: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic (COVID -19), conversations surrounding the 
return to physical activity and sports are in the beginning stages.  However, recommendations and guidelines 
for wearing face coverings during physical activity are conflicting among gyms, schools, and collegiate and 
professional sports.  
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all people over the age of 2 wear a 
cloth face covering in public settings, especially when social distancing mea sures are difficult to maintain.1  
Conversely, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that people should not wear face coverings when 
exercising, as masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably and that sweat can make the face coverings  
become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms.2  
 
In accordance with Executive Order GA -29, the University Interscholastic League (UIL) of [LOCATION_007] requires 
students, staff, and visitors to wear face coverings when entering and exiting facilities and practice areas, and 
when not acti vely exercising. Schools may, for example, allow students who are actively exercising to remove 
face coverings as long as they maintain at least six feet of distance from other students and staff who are not 
wearing face coverings. However, schools must re quire students and staff to wear face coverings as they get 
into positions that allow them to maintain safe distancing.3 The NCAA has similar recommendations for 
collegiate athletics including universal masking when physical distancing is not possible.4  The National 
Football League (NFL) is currently inve stigating the use of modified face coverings  and helmets, though 
specific regulations have yet to be unveiled.  
 
There is no scientific evidence available on the impact of wearing a face covering  on sports performance 
(exercise capacity ) during this pandemic.5 
 
Phase II: Previous research has found that more than 40% of patients with COVID showed 
neurologic manifestations at the outset, and more than 30% o f those had impaired cognition.[ADDRESS_929167] of a  prospective, randomized crossover trial 
of 50  eligible participants.  Investiga tors will compare VO2 max during two maximal

 cardiopulmonary stress exercise tests (CPET) on a cycle ergometer, seven to ten days apart , and 
examine differences in cognitive performance . ECG monitoring will take place during exercise 
testing  among individu als with history of COVID -19.   Previous research regarding cognitive 
performance includes private studies completed between Sports Academy Cognition Lab (SACL) 
and GlaxoSmithKline Human Performance Lab ([COMPANY_004] -HPL) to investigate the relationship between 
cognitive performance and sports performance training. As part of this research, inte rnational -level 
cricket athletes completed daily cognitive performance assessments using the SACL Cognition  
application on iPad as part of their sport performance training. The results showed that performance 
on a simple reaction time (SRT) task was statis tically significantly correlated to a variety of 
physiological sports performance measures, including heart rate, sleep quality, self -assessment of 
motivation, self -assessment of physical soreness. When SRT was higher (i.e., slower), heart rate, 
sleep qual ity, motivation, soreness, and freshness were measured/rated lower. Among professional 
rugby [CONTACT_412241], SRT was correlated with body weight, mood, sleep quality, training performance, 
and distance covered in training. When SRT was higher, body weight, mood, sleep quality, training 
performance, and training distance covered all tended to be lower. The correlations were relatively 
small but reached statistical significance over large samples and across a wide variety of 
physiological output measures, suggesting  that the relationship between cognitive and physical 
performance is broad even if not deep. These results are relevant to the current research as they 
support the inclusion of a cognitive performance metric (e.g., SRT) when evaluating the effect of 
face c overings on overall sport performance.  
 
Therefore, in order to investigate  the impact of face coverings on exercise capacity , research will take place 
in two phases:  
 
Phase I:  Participants will be randomized and complete 2 treadmill trials including (1) cardiopulmonary 
exercise tests ( CPET ) with face covering, and (2) CPET without face covering.  
 
Phase II: Participants will be randomized  and will complete 2 cycle ergometer trials including (1) 
cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) with face covering, and (2) CPET without face covering.  Cognitive 
testing will occur incrementally as exertion increases.

 Figure 1. Phase I Randomization diagram  
Phase II:  
 
In this prospective, randomized crossover trial of 50 eligible participants, we will compare two maximal 
cardiopulmonary stress exercise tests (CPET) on a cycle ergometer, seven to ten days apart , and the impact on 
cognitive performance . ECG monitoring will ta ke place during exercise testing  among individuals with history 
of COVID -19. Subjects will be randomized into either the face covering or non -face covering group using a 
1:[ADDRESS_929169] (see Figure 2 . Randomization diagram, below). A within -subjects analysis will be performed 
stratified by [CONTACT_4321].  
 
Cognitive testing will take place at the end of each stage of the CPET. Cognitive testing using  the SACL 
Cognition application on iPad will include a baseline SRT measurement and additional measurements at the  
end of each stage of the CPET. The baseline wi ll include a 30s session of SRT for familiarization and then a 
30s session will be scored. SRT will then be administered for 30s at the end of each stage of the CPET. The 
SRT task includes a visual stimulus presented on the touchscreen. Subjects will be in structed to press the 
stimulus on -screen as quickly as possible. Reaction time and accuracy will be measured on the SRT task. 
Reaction time is calculated as the average amount of time in seconds between stimulus presentation and user 
response within a sess ion. Accuracy is calculated as the total number of correct responses to stimuli divided 
by [CONTACT_685523] a session  (presented as a percentage) .

BSWRI ~ Office of Academic Research Development (updated 9/20/2017)  
 comply with current state and local recommendations. If the subject screens negative on both assessm ents, 
subject will be taken int o testing area for CPET testing.  
 
Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_685527]. Informed consent will be conducted in a private location using similar 
procedures as described above  by [CONTACT_685528]. Participants will be informed about 
the study, have sufficient time to review the consent form, and all study questions will be answered prior to 
signature. Participants will be given sufficient opportunity to decide whether or not they want to participate. If 
the participant elects to enroll in the study, they will be instructed on how to sign the consent form and a copy 
will be given to them prior to the initiation of any study procedures.   
 
Randomization  
Phase I & II: Participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be approached, screened, consented, 
and enrolled into the study. After obtaining informed consent, participants will be random ized to either 
complete their first test with no face co vering or with a face covering in a  1:1 randomization ratio stratified  by 
[CONTACT_4321]. A random number generator will be used to pre -determine the randomization group for each participant  
ID number. The group assignment will be not be revealed to either the partic ipant or the study staff until 
informed consent is complete.    
 
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)  
During the screening  process, subjects will be encouraged to abstain from nicotine and caffeine prior to the 
test. Subjects will be scheduled to perform a CPET on a treadmill with (arm 1) and without (arm 2) a face 
covering  (with testing for each arm seven to ten days apart) . A face covering will be provided to participants 
randomized into the face covering group, with the option for participants to keep their face covering at the end 
of the assessment. Subjects will be fitted for metabolic testing (K5 CPET, COSMED, Concord, CA ) equipment 
according to factory requirements.  https://www.cosmed.com/en/products/cardio -pulmonary -exercise -test/k5   
 
The use of new cloth face coverings beneath the K5 ma sk will be standardized , with face coverings consisting 
of the same material and cut/design for each participant (which the participant then keeps or discards).   The 
correct fitting and leak tightness will be confirmed before each test for each subject.  T his will be achieved 
through (a) inspi[INVESTIGATOR_23735] (b) expi[INVESTIGATOR_685516]. During both maneuvers, the valve of the mask 
is closed leading to abrupt stop of  the air flow . The fitting is carefully checked for the absence of any acoustic, 
sensory or visual indication of leakage (e.g., lifting of the mask, whistling or lateral airflow) by [CONTACT_685529].  
 
Phase I CPET Procedures:  
 
The CPET will be performed in an area with immediate access to an automated external defibrillator ( AED).  
Resting blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oxygenation and will be measured and recorded. Explanation of the 
Borg dyspnea and exertion scales will occur by [CONTACT_685530]. Each subject 
will be asked to perform the exe rcise test to the best of their abilities. At the beginning of the test , subject s will 
be instructed to perform a walking warm up  of 3 minutes at 1.7 speed and 0% incline.  
 
• The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (6 -20) scale will be used during the test to assess sub jective 
exertion  
• The Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale (0 -10) will be used to assess subjective shortness of breath.  
• Intermittent blood pressure measurements and pulse oximeter measurements will be taken by [CONTACT_685531].  
 
Testing will be terminated if any of the following occurs: (a) subject becomes symptomatic; (b ) pain is 
reported; (c) subject wishes to terminate test; (d) unsafe drop in blood pressure or hypertension over 250/120 
mmHg reported; or (e) subject reports a “20” on Borg RPE scale or “10” on Dyspnea scale. Other termination 
of the test is reserved for the clinical judgment of research staff to ensure safety of the subject. After termination

 of the test, subject will be instructed to perform a walking cool -down of [ADDRESS_929175] testing materials.  
 
Phase II CPET Procedures:  
Among individuals with history of COVID -19, an ECG will be per formed prior to CPET procedures and will 
be monitored throughout the CPET.  
 
The CPET will be performed in an area with immediate access to an automated external defibrillator (AED). 
Resting  ECG  (among individuals with history of COVID -19), blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oxygenation , 
and blood lactate  and will be measured and recorded. Explanation of the Borg dyspne a and exertion scales will 
occur by [CONTACT_685530]. Each subject will be asked to perform the exercise 
test to the best of their abilities.  
 
A standard cyc le ergometry ramp protocol7 will be designed for each participant  as used in previous masking 
study .[ADDRESS_929176]’s age and 
weight .    The protocol consists of 1 minute of unloaded cycling, foll owed by a 2 -minute warmup at 25 W.  
The exercise phase consists of continuous progressive increases in power output ( 25 W ∙ min-1) every three 
minutes  until the subject is unable to maintain 50 rpm.  This is followed by 4 min of active recovery at 20 W.   
 
• The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (6 -20) scale will be used during the test to assess subjective 
exertion  
• The Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale (0 -10) will be used to assess subjective shortness of breath.  
• Intermittent blood pressure measurements an d pulse oximeter measurements will be taken by [CONTACT_685531].  
 
•            Blood lactate wil l be measured pre and post -CPET  using a Nova Medical Lactate Plus: Blood Lactate 
Measuring Meter -Version 2  device.  
 
Testing will be terminated if any of the following occurs: (a) subject becomes symptomatic; (b) pain is 
reported; (c) subject wishes to terminate test; (d) unsafe drop in blood pressure or hypertension over 250/120 
mmHg reported; o r (e) subject reports a “20” on Borg RPE scale or “10” on Dyspnea scale. Other termination 
of the test is reserved for the clinical judgment of research staff to ensure safety of the subject. After termination 
of the test, subject will be instructed to per form a cycling  cool-down of [ADDRESS_929177] u sing BSWH approved disinfectant wipes (sani 
cloths AF3) using Cidezyme and Cidex OPA with testing strips  as per factory requirements. This process  will 
take place in a designated “dirty room” to perform high level disinfecting (e.g., sink and proper ventil ation) 
and has been approved by [CONTACT_685532] -19 spread in addition 
to other high -consequence infectious diseases (procedure provided in supplementary procedures).

All subject tracking information will be maintained in a password -protected Excel spreadsheet and REDcap, a 
HIPAA -compliant (21 CFR Part 11) secure web application on a BSWH computer by [CONTACT_3665]. 
 
All case report forms and outcomes data will be input into REDcap, a HIPAA -compliant (21 CFR Part 11) 
secure web application on a BSWH computer by [CONTACT_685534].   
 
Data Quality Assurance  
Data management functions will occur on a monthly  basis and will include data quality checks and verification, 
as well as internal edit and logic checks (e.g., out of range values, internal inconsistencies). Ten percent of 
charts will be audited for source document and data entry review. Cross tabulation  checks using SAS will also 
be used. Data will be stored and backed -up periodically on the biostatistician’s space on the secure server. 
Descriptive statistics will be at calculated and included into quarterly reports to ensure the quality of data and 
progress of the study.  
 
Record Retention  
All paper source documents will be kept in a double lock ed storage cabinet in the BSW research office  at The 
Star. All electronic data will be kept on a secure server per federal guidelines. All data will be maintained for 
two years after study termination per federal guidelines and will be disposed of in accordance to current 
BSWRI policy.  
 
Management of Subject Safety/ Adverse events  
The study staff (PI, Co -Investigators, research coordinators and assistants) will be r esponsible for collecting 
and recording all clinical data. As results are collected, all Adverse Events will be identified, graded for severity 
and assigned causality, reported to the IRB, and compi[INVESTIGATOR_51376]. After assigning causality, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_685519]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_685520]/benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to 
the protocol or informed consent form are required. An electronic regulatory binder in REDCap will be used 
to manage study logs and regulatory documentation.  Throughout this process, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_685521]. The plan to monitor participant data and safety will spe cifically include the 
following:  (1) [CONTACT_685537] will inspect collected data; (2) The IRB offices will be contact[CONTACT_685535]; (3) the research protocol will be revised if it is determined that the protocol 
or interv ention presents an unforeseen risk to participants; (4) if an event occurs that requires immediate 
attention and [CONTACT_685537] is unavailable, then members of the research team will follow the emergency 
procedures put in place by [CONTACT_5051], which may include calling emergency medical services ; (5) an 
invitation to BSW Research Institute Quality Assurance will be delivered to conduct a site visit for internal 
auditing of procedures and documentation . 
 
Study Withdrawal  
Subjects may voluntarily discontinu e participation in the study at any time, for any reason.

 Protocol Deviations  
All protocol deviations will be recorded in the participant’s chart and electronic regulatory binder (REDCap) 
as they occur, and subsequently formally to the IRB at continuing review.  
 
Data Analysis  
Participant characteristics will be summarized with means and standard deviations or medians and 
interquartile ranges for numerical variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables. The 
primary outcomes, VO2 max and test duration, will first  be assessed for normality using a 
Kolmogorov -Smirnov  test prior to determining the analysis to be used. If the distribution meets the 
normality assumption, paired t -tests will be used to determine if there is a difference between 
participants when wearing  and not wearing a face covering. If the distribution does not meet the 
normality assumption, Wilcoxon signed -rank tests will be used. All secondary outcomes will follow 
the same analysis plan of assessing the normal distribution assumption to determine th e appropriate 
test for each outcome. Inter -rater reliability analysis will be conducted for the Attitudes for Face 
Coverings Questionnaire. All analysis will be performed using SAS 9.4 at a 0.05 significance level.  
Risks & Benefits  
- Physical risks: The pote ntial risks include any and all risks associated with exercise including muscular 
injury, increased blood pressure  and heart rate, and cardiac arrest. Other risks include hypoglycemia post -
exercise and lightheadedness or syncope. Although some risks are un avoidable, the careful monitoring of 
signs and symptoms by [CONTACT_685536].   
– No psychological risks have been identified by [CONTACT_4907].  
– No social risks have been identified by [CONTACT_660109] . 
– No economic risks  have been identified by [CONTACT_4907].   
– No legal risks have been identified by [CONTACT_4907].  
- Potential benefits: Participants in this study may experience greater confidence in performing aerobic 
activities and may gain a better understanding of their personal functional exercise capacity at the time of 
testing.  Participants  may also better understand their body’s response to exercise with and without a face 
covering which may impact training and performance in recreational and occupational ventures.  
 
The risks posed to study are minimal in this cohort, while the intervention poses multiple substantial benefits 
to society, as it will shed light on the impact of face coverings on performance in a ma ximal exercise test. It is 
hoped that the information gained from this study will contribute to an evidence base regarding the use of face 
coverings in settings requiring maximal physical effort.

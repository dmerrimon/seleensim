7 1. Introduction  
1.1 Colon Cancer  
1.1.1  Background  
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a signific ant cause of cancer mortality. 
The worldwide incidence of CRC in 2000 was estimated as 944,700 
cases (males: 498,000; females: 446,000 cases) (1). In the United 
States (US) colorectal cancer accounts for approximately 11% of all cancer deaths (2). At diagnosis, 40% of the world’s CRC population 
have metastatic or “synchronous metastases.” In the US, 
approximately 20% of newly diagnosed patients with CRC will have synchronous metastatic cancer (3). Approximately 25% of patients 
with localized disease at diagnosis will ultimately develop metastatic 
disease.  Unfortunately only a small number of patients with stage IV 
cancer can be cured with multimodality therapy. The majority of 
patients with metastatic, stage IV CRC will ultimately die of their 
disease (4).  
Newly developed, and now standard, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483893].  Thus, in the U.S., initial therapy with combinations of 5-
fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or 5FU and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) have  increased response rates to approximately 45 percent  
(5). The addition of beva cizumab to either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI has 
produced response rates of 60%.  Indeed, for approximately eight 
percent of patients  with stage IV CRC, the addition of surgery to 
successful chemotherapy will produce a cure (6). Upon progression 
after so-called “first -line therapy,” approximately 20% of patients  will 
respond to a second systemic treatment combination. Most important, 
median survival for patients  with stage IV CRC is now approaching 
2.5 years  (7). It is likely  that with a better understanding of how to 
incorporate intratumoral molecular parameters such as mutations in the k -ras gene and/or  quantitation of a tumor’s repair genes such 
ERCC- 1 or XRCC- 1 and/or targets such as thymidylate synthase into 
treatment strategies,  complet e responses and cure rates will continue 
to improve.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_621906] improved survival from a median of 12 months to nearly 24 
months.  A series of trial showed that c ombination therapy using 
oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) or irinotecan (IFL or FOLFIRI) gave improved 
RR, OS and PFS compared with FU and LV  bolus or infusion therapy. 
This was confirmed in the N971 US Intergroup trial showing improved RR, OS and PFS for FOLFOX compared with the control arm of IFL 
(5).  Shortly thereafter a randomized trial of IFL with or without 
bevacizumab showed and improved HR for PFS and OS for the addit ion of the anti -VEGF antibody. This has been adopted into 
standard practice with all 5FU based first line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including FOLFIRI or FOLFOX.  A more recent study (NO16966) demonstrated 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
8 improved PFS with the addition of bevacizumab to either FOLFOX or 
CapeOX therapy, though of a smaller benefit due to early  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_483894] (7). As FOL FOX has become the standard first -line 
chemotherapy platform, particularly in the US, second line therapy 
has relied on irinotecan based programs. 
1.1.3  Second Line Therapy  
A study performed by [CONTACT_483929] (8). As a result, US practice has evolved to use irinotecan based regimens as second- line therapy.  Either FOLFIRI or irinotecan 
seem equally useful in this situation and either may be used as there is no study showing a synergistic effect of fluoropyrimidines with irinotecan.  In the GERCOR multi- center study, patients with 
advanced CRC were treated with FOLFOX followed by [CONTACT_483930] s equence.  In the FOLFOX first 
arm, the response rate for second line FOLFIRI was 4% and PFS was 2.5 months.  A larger second line study was performed to examine the role of the anti -EGF antibody, cetuximab as second line therapy on 
patients progressing on FOLFOX.  In this 1300 patient study, the 
subjects were randomized to irionotecan alone or irinotecan plus 
cetuximab (9).  The patient populations were not selected for Kras 
status.  Again the response rate for second line irinotecan was 4.2% and PFS was 2.6 months (n = 650).   
Recent reports of the pr edictive value of K -ras gene mutation ( 36,37) 
have demonstrated convincingly that patients with mutations in codon 
12 and 13 (as determined by [CONTACT_937] -PCR from FFPET) do not benefit 
from the use of anti -EGFR antibodies, either as single agent or in 
combination with chemotherapy programs (10). As such, two 
treatment tracks exist for second- line therapy, based on cetuximab 
use in the K -ras wild -type group and irinotecan based therapy alone in 
those with Kras mutations.  In this study, the patient population will be 
limited to those with Kras wild -type status, as both arms will receive 
cetuximab and irinotecan.   
1.1.4  Biweekly Dosing of Cetuximab 
Cetuximab is approved for previously treated colon cancer with non -
mutated K -ras (“wild type”).  The standard dose and schedule is 400 
mg/m
2 loading dose x 1, then weekly 250 mg/m2.  Because of the long 
half-life of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab , 
many such agents have alternate dosing schedules of q2 weeks or 
even q3 weeks.  In this study we have chosen the dose of 500 mg/m2 
every two weeks, for the reasons detailed below, and also to facilitate co-administration with the irinotecan (180 mg/m
2) biweekly schedule.  
Data supporting the biweekly dose of cetuximab 500 mg/m2 have 
been presented and published.  Tabernero, et al (Tabernero, Cervantes, Martinelli, et. Al, J Clin Oncol, 24 ([ADDRESS_621907]), 142s) 
performed a phase I/PK study demonstrating equivalent 
pharmacokinetic parameters for the drug on the q2w schedule.  [ADDRESS_621908] dose/schedule were used in 
comparison. No significant differences were seen with respect to 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
9 AUC, half -life, or steady -state clearance between the two schedules 
(Table 1).  In addition, the Phase I portion of the study escalated 
cetuximab dose to achieve a gr 2 -3 skin  rash, reaching doses of 700 
mg/m2 q2w safely. The study was continuing at the time of 
presentation.

Mean (SD)  
This combination of irinotecan 180 mg/m2 and cetuximab 500 mg/m2 
q2w has also been reported in a Spanish phase II study (Martin-Martorell, et.al. Br J Ca 99: 455 -458, 2008).  Forty patients were 
treated and a response rate of 23% was reported (compared with 
20% in the EPIC trial, N =1147), with a Disease Control Rate of 60%.  
Median time to progression was 3.4 months and overall survival was 8 
months.  This also is approximately equivalent to the cetuximab arm 
of the EPIC trial.  Toxicity of grade 3- 4 severity was reported as 
diarrhea = 10%, neutropenia = 7.5% and skin toxicity = 7.5%, which 
are all somewhat lower than similarly reported toxicity rates in the 
EPIC trial.   In short, this phase II study suggests the activity and 
toxicity is not substantially different using irinotecan and cetuximab 
q2w compared with irinotecan every 3 weeks with weekly cetuximab.  This biweekly schedule has been widely adopted in practice by [CONTACT_483931].  
1.2 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Angiogenesis  
Angiogenesis, the formation of new capi[INVESTIGATOR_483895], is a tightly -
controlled, multistep process that is a component of normal physiology (includi ng 
development of the embryonic vasculature, wound healing, ovulation, and menstruation). Pathologic angiogenesis contributes to tumor growth and 
metastasis, as well as other human diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis (11-13). A number of growth factors have 
been identified as positive regulators of angiogenesis, including members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, basic fibroblast growth factor, 
transforming growth factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta, tumor necrosis factor, platelet -derived endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, 
angiogenin, interleukin- 8, and placental growth factor (14,15). VEGF- A is one of 
several related cytokines; it is distinct in that it acts as an endothelial cell-specific 
mitogen and is the growth factor most consistently found in conditions associated 
with angiogenesis (16 -19). The biological activity of VEGF -A (hereafter VEGF) is 
principally mediated by [CONTACT_483932] -related, high affinity tyrosine kinase 
receptors: the 180 kDa fms -like tyrosine kinase (VEGFR -1 or Flt -1) (20,21); and 
the 200 kDa receptor (VEGFR -2 or kinase insert domain- containing receptor  
[KDR]), or its murine homologue, fetal liver kinase- 1 (Flk -1)(20,21) .  Targeted 
deletion of genes encoding VEGF, VEGFR -1, or VEGFR -[ADDRESS_621909] in 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
10 blood vessel formation.  Mice lacking even a single VEGF allele die prior to birth  
due to vascular abnormalities (24,25). VEGFR-2- deficient mice have impaired 
blood island formation and lack mature endothelial cells (26),  whereas VEGFR -[ADDRESS_621910] abundant endothelial cell -like cells, but fail to develop normal 
vasculature  (27). 
1.3 The Role of VEGF and VEGFR -2 in A ngiogenesis and Tumor Growth  
The importance of VEGF and VEGFR -2 in angiogenesis and tumor growth has 
been demonstrated in several animal models.  VEGFR -2 expression is 
associated with activated endothelium and is strongly upregulated in tumor 
endothelium ( 16,28). Inhibiting the function of the VEGF/VEGFR -[ADDRESS_621911] via a 
number of approaches, including anti -VEGF antibodies, anti -VEGFR- 2 
antibodies, anti- VEGF antisense ribonucleic acid expression, VEGF- based 
immunotoxins, soluble VEGF receptors, ribozymes to VEGF receptors, and small 
molecule VEGFR -2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has been shown to inhibit new 
blood vessel formation and tumor growth in a variety of animal models (29 -32). 
VEGF and VEGFR -[ADDRESS_621912], cervix, 
bladder, ovary, uterus, endometrium, and kidney; Kaposi’s sarcoma; glioblastoma multiforme; and hemangioblastomas.  In addition, messenger 
ribonucleic acid for both VEGFR -1 and VE GFR -2 is greatly upregulated in tumor -
associated endothelial cells, but not in the vasculature of the surrounding normal tissue.  A correlation between VEGFR- 2 expression and tumor microvessel 
density has been associated with poor prognosis, advanced disease, increased 
risk of metastasis and recurrence, and lower relapse- free survival in pati ents with 
a variety of cancers (13,32).  
Accumulating evidence suggests that the dual autocrine/paracrine mechanism 
also may play an important role in the growth and met astasis of certain solid 
tumors. For example, a VEGF/VEGFR autocrine loop was proposed as a 
mediator of growth and metastasis of several types of tumors, including carcinomas of prostate, ovary, pancreas, and breast; malignant pleural 
mesothelioma; and melanoma (32). These observations suggest that anti-
VEGFR- [ADDRESS_621913] potential as antiangiogenic and antitumor agents.  
1.4 IMC-1121B (Ramucirumab)  
Ramucirumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (MAb) of the 
immunoglobulin G, subclass 1 (IgG 1) that specifically binds to the extracellular 
domain of VEGFR -2 with high affinity.  This antibody potently blocks the binding 
of the VEGF ligand to VEGFR -2, inhibits VEGF -stimulated activation of both 
VEGFR- 2 and p44/p42 MAP kinases, and neutralizes VEGF- induced 
mitogenesis of human endothelial cells.  
Ramucirumab  has been shown to block the interaction of VEGF and VEGFR -2 
(with a concentration that inhibits binding by 50% of approximately 1 nM), and to 
inhibit VEGF -stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells and VEGF induced 
migration of human leukemia cells (33,34).  
Preclinical pharmacodynamic data demonstrate that Ramucirumab  binds 
specifically and with high affinity to the VEGFR -2, and is capable of inhibiting 
certain in vitro biological processes.  These include VEGF/VEGFR -2 interaction, 
VEGF -stimulated VEGFR -2 activation, proliferation of human endothelial cells, 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
11 VEGF -induced migration of human leukemia cells, and VEGF -induced 
phosphorylation of VEGFR- 2 in both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 
porcine aortic endothelial cells engineered to overexpress VEGFR -2 (34).   These 
processes are likely involved in tumor angiogenesis.  Potent angiogenic and 
antitumor effects are observed when DC101, an antibody to murine VEGFR -2, is 
administered to mice bearing syngeneic tumors or human tumor xenografts.  The results of these preclinical pharmacodynamic studies support the investigation of Ramucirumab  in the treatment of solid tumors.  
Two repeat -dose toxicology studies (5 weeks and 39 weeks) were conducted in 
cynomolgus monkeys.  In the 5- week repeat -dose study, Ramucirumab  was 
administered intravenously at doses of 0, 4, 12, or 40 mg/kg.  There were no Ramucirumab  -related effects seen in clinical signs, body weights, food 
consumption, urinalysis, blood pressure, hematology, coagulation, and serum 
chemistry.  There were also no Ramucirumab  -related effects found at gross 
pathology evaluation.  Histopathology evaluation revealed focal muscle fiber degeneration and mononuclear cell infiltration in skeletal muscle (quadriceps 
femoris) in test article -treated animals only.  These effects were concluded to be 
not treatment -related due to the focal nature of the lesions and the low incidence 
in females.  The Ramucirumab injection sites had mild reactions consisting of 
mononuclear cells or mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells in perivascular 
areas.  Based on the results of this study, intravenous administration of 
Ramucirumab  was well tolerated at dose levels from 4 to 40 mg/kg for four doses 
and the no- observabl e-effect level (NOEL) in this study was ≥ 40 mg/kg, the 
highest dose administered.  
In the 39 -week repeat -dose study, Ramucirumab  was administered via 
intravenous infusion at dose levels of 5, 16, and 50 mg/kg to cynomolgus monkeys for 11 weekly doses over 12 weeks (females only) or weekly for 39 
weeks (males and females) of study.  There were no Ramucirumab  -related 
effects noted in animals treated at up to 50 mg/kg for 12 weeks of study.  Thickening and osteochondropathy of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_483896] 
5 mg/kg and above in animals treated for [ADDRESS_621914].  Treatment with Ramucirumab  resulted in renal toxicity 
at the 16 - and 50- mg/kg dose levels after 39 weeks.  In addition, clinical 
chemistry and urinalysis parameters indicated that the renal toxicity had 
manifested at 16 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg after 26 weeks.  A NOEL of Ramucirumab  
could not be established when administered intravenously once a week for 39 weeks in male or female cynomolgus monkeys.  
1.4.1  Clinical Studies  
Two Phase 1 studies are being conducted to evaluate the safety and antitumor effects of Ramucirumab administered either weekly (CP12-
0401) or every other week or every third week (CP12- 0402) at doses 
ranging from 2 mg/kg through 20 mg/kg in patients with advanced 
cancer.  Two mechanism -based, dose- limiting toxicities were 
observed at the weekly schedule of 16 mg/kg, symptomatic 
hypertension and deep vein thrombosis, both of which occurred after 
several cycles of Ramucirumab  infusion.  Thus, the maximum 
tolerated dose for the weekly study was determined as 13 mg/kg administered on a weekly schedule.  The MTD has not been reached 
for the every other week or the every third week schedules. 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_621915] been enrolled in study CP12-0 401 
(Ramucirumab administered weekly) at doses of 2 to 16 mg/kg; this 
patient population includes 23 males and 14 females, ranging in age 
from 36 to 76 years.  Adverse events ≥ grade [ADDRESS_621916] possibly -related to Ramucirumab  were reported  in 10 patients 
and include hypertension, deep vein thrombosis, headache, vomiting, anemia, increased amylase, hyperphosphatemia, and proteinuria.  To 
date, four confirmed partial responses (in melanoma, gastric and 
neuroendocrine tumors, and uterine leiomy osarcoma) have been 
reported, and at least nine patients have experienced prolonged stable disease (>  6 months).  At least one of these patients had been 
treated previously with the anti- VEGF agent bevacizumab. 
Importantly, other evidence of clinical benef it has also been noted.  In 
particular, several patients (melanoma [1 patient], gastric cancer [1

relief along with reductions in analgesic requirements, and a patient 
with refractory pleural effusions experienced significant reductions in fluid retention and a lower frequency of thoracenteses.  
A total of [ADDRESS_621917] been enrolled in study CP12- 0402 
(Ramucirumab administered every other week or every 3 weeks), of 
whom [ADDRESS_621918] received treatment at doses ranging from 6 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg.  The MTD has not been reached for the every -other -week 
or the every -third-week schedules; the study is ongoing but currently 
closed to enrollment.  
A total of 13 of 24 (54.2%) patients to date have experienced events 
that were considered possibly, probably, or definitely related (related) 
to treatment with Ramucirumab. The most common (> 10%) 
treatment -related events were proteinuria (16.7%), diarrhea (12.5%), 
and hypertension (12.5%).  Adverse events ≥ Grade  [ADDRESS_621919] possibly related to Ramucirumab  were reported in three 
patients and include duodenal ulcer hemorrhage (Grade 4), 
hypertension, and fatigue.  
As of 1 September 2008, 19 patients were evaluable for response; of these patients, [ADDRESS_621920] overall response of stable disease, including five with SD ≥ 6 months. These five patients had 
cancers of the colon (2 patients), liver (2  patients), and kidney (1 
patient). Three of these patients have had ongoing SD for >  10 
months duration.  Six patients remain on study (two patients in the 
10-mg/kg every other week cohort, two patients in the 15- mg/kg every 
three week cohort, and two patients in the 20 -mg/kg every three week 
cohort).  
As of January 18, 2010, at least [ADDRESS_621921] one dose of blinded IMC -

Some of the published data include:  
a) The Phase 1 Monotherapy Study  (Spratlin et al. J Clin Oncol 
2010; 28: e -published 4 Jan 2010).  37 patients treated with 
advanced, refractory soli d tumors.  Ramucirumab was given 
weekly as monotherapy.  Reported results included PR in 4/27 
(15%) patients with measurable disease and PR or SD ≥ 6 months 
in 11/37 (30%) of patients.  
b) Initial Phase 2 Presentation for metastatic, TKI- refractory Renal 
Cancer (Garcia  et al. ESMO/ECCO Berlin 2009. 40 patients were 
given ramucirumab 8mg/kg q 2 wk. Of these, 50% had prior 
sunitinib, 35% prior sunitinib and sorafenib and15% prior sorafenib. The preliminary median PFS is 6 months and 3/40 (7%) 
had confirmed PR. The drug was well -tolerated.  
Additional phase II studies are underway in RCC, HCC, melanoma, 
prostate cancer, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, GBM, colorectal, breast and 
bladder cancer. Phase [ADDRESS_621922] cancer, with 
others planned in HCC, colorectal cancer.  Further phase 2 results will 
be presented at GU ASCO (RCC update), ASCO (melanoma, HCC, 
NSCLC) in 2010.  
Additional toxicities (observed in preliminary phase 2 studies) and 
potential toxicities (based on the known toxicity profiles of agents 
which inhibit the VEGF or VEGF -receptor pathway) are presented in 
the most recent Investigator Brochure.  No additional safety patterns have been demonstrated conclusively beyond those observed, 
discussed and reported in the most recent Investigator Brochure. 
1.4.[ADDRESS_621923] demonstrated that the efficacy of DC101, a murine analogue to 
Ramucirumab , was evident in vivo at trough concentrations of 18 
µg/mL. The target serum concentration for Ram ucirumab is 
hypothesized to be one that maintains Ramucirumab  at trough pl asma 
concentrations ≥ 20 µg/mL.  Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) data 
from studies CP12- 0401 and CP12- 0402 indicate that the minimum 
20 µg/mL target trough concentrations are attainable.  In the every -
other -week protocol, following the initial dose of 6 mg /kg, mean serum 
trough concentrations (immediately prior to the next dose) of 
Ramucirumab  were 31 µg/mL (range: 18–64 µg/mL [n=7]).  Analysis 
of the initial 8- mg/kg dose at the same time point yielded a mean 
serum trough concentration of 115 µg/mL (range: 18 - 205 µg/mL 
[n=3]).  To provide a suitable margin above the 20 µg/mL 
Ramucirumab  target concentration, the proposed dose and regimen 
for this Phase 3 study will be 8 mg/kg Ramucirumab  given every other 
week.  At this dose and regimen, the half -life following the initial 
infusion of IMC -Ramucirumab is approximately 155 hours; following 
later infusions during the first cycle, the half -life is approximately 
300 hours, suggesting that steady state is being approached.  
Supporting this observation is the finding that as the dose of IMC -
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
14 Ramucirumab  was increased from 6 to 13 mg/kg, clearance 
decreased from 0.237 mL/hr/kg to a plateau of 0.06 mL/hr/kg 
(clearance at 8 mg/kg was approximately 0.113 mL/hr/kg).  
1.[ADDRESS_621924] commonly in the US includes ox aliplatin, 
leucovorin and 5FU (a modified FOLFOX regimen).  Whether continuing anti -
angiogenic therapy after first line therapy is beneficial  remains an open question.  
Studies to date have shown benefit for addition of bevacizumab in first line 
therapy and in second line therapy in bevacizumab- naïve patients. In the case of 
patients with Kras wild -type cancers, standard second line therapy would 
generally include irinotecan with cetuximab, based on the EPIC trial which demonstrated a doubling in PFS (9).  We have chosen this regimen as the 
control arm for this study, which will compare addition of the anti -VEGFR 
antibody, Ramucirumab.  The goal of this study is to show improved PFS with the 
addition of a novel second line anti -angiogenic antibody.

15 1.6 Summary of Toxicity Review  
The study was closed to accrual on June 14, 2012 after 35 registrations were 
accrued as per pre- planned toxicity review. 18 patients (17 treated; one case 
never started assigned therapy) were accrued to Arm A (IC) and 17 (16 treated; one case was a duplicate registration) to Arm B (ICR). AdEERS Reporting was 
reviewed and real time data were obtained on all treated patients. It was clear 
that more toxicity was seen in Arm B. Worst toxicity per patient is seen in the figure below.  The overall grade 3 -5 toxicity rates were 17% for Arm A and 75% 
for Arm B. There were 2 toxic deaths in Arm B. Toxicities of higher incidence in Arm B included neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhea and GI perforation (including 
peri-anal abscess).  In addition mean dose given in Arm B (mean % RDI) was 
considerably lower in Arm B:  65% for irinotecan, 85% for cetuximab and 92% for ramucirumab (even though no dose reductions were allowed in the protocol). 
This compares to 99% irinotecan and 98% cetuximab average %RDI in Arm A. Furthermore, only 3/17 patients in Arm A required dose reduction, compared to 
15/16 in Arm B. On the other hand with a median of 8 cycles preliminary analysis 
showed that fewer patients in Arm B went off treatment for progression compared with Arm A, and more remained on treatment at the time of the analysis. Of the 
17 treated in Arm A, 8 out of 9 patients off study had progression (PD), while in 
Arm B, of the [ADDRESS_621925] potential benefit for the addition of ramucirumab among 
patients who can tolerate therapy. Therefore, we propose a reduced dose regimen in Arm C (modified ICR) with irinotecan 150 mg/m
2, cetuximab 400 
mg/m2 and ramucirumab 6 mg/m2 as starting doses, more strict eligibility criteria, 
and more aggressive dose modifications for toxicity.  Because those patients on 
protocol who did tolerate the ICR regimen at the reduced doses seemed to stay 
on study longer, we believe the study should be continued as modified at those 
lower doses. The Arm C starting doses are equal to the actual “percent 
recommended dose intensity” received by [CONTACT_315114] B.

5.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
5.2.1  Purpose 
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are required 
as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of the Rev. 12/11 , 6/14 Rev. 12/11  
Rev. 6/14 Rev. 6/14

26 patients enrolled, as well as those who will enroll in future studies 
using similar a gents.  
• Routine reporting:  Adverse events are reported in a routine 
manner at scheduled times during a trial (please refer to the E7208 Forms Packet for the list of forms with directions and 
timeframes for routine adverse event reporting).  
• Expedited reporting : In addition to routine reporting, certain 
adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner  via 
CTEP -AERS for timelier monitoring  of patient safety and care. The 
following sections provide information and instructions regarding 
expedited adverse event reporting.  
5.2.2  Terminology  
• Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a  drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
labor atory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.  
• Attribution:  An assessment of the relationship between the 
adverse event and the protocol treatment, using the following categories.  
ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION  
Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT  related  to treatment  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related  to treatment  
Possible  The AE may be related  to treatment  
Probabl e The AE is likely related  to treatment  
Definite  The AE is clearly related  to treatment  
• CAEPR ( Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks 
List):  An NCI generated list of reported and/or potential AEs 
associated with an agent currently under an NCI IND.  Information contained in the CAE PR is compi[INVESTIGATOR_311289]’s 
Brochure, the Package Insert, as well as company safety reports.   
• CTCAE:   The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events provides a descriptive terminology that is to be utilized for 
AE reporting.  A grade (severity) is provided for each AE term.   
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]):  For AE 
reporting purposes, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240542] 24 hours.   
• Life Threatening Adverse Event:   Any AE that places the 
subject at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.   
• Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any adverse event occurring at 
any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
• Death  Rev. 6/14 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
27 • A life -threatening adverse event   
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] (for  ≥ 24 hours).  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important Medical Events (IME)  that may not result in death, 
be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_372203] a serious adverse event  when  it may jeopardize 
the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
5.2.3  Reporting Procedure  
This study requires that expedited adverse event reporting use 
CTEP’s Adverse Event Reporting System ( CTEP -AERS). CTEP’s  
guidelines for CTEP -AERS  can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov
.  A 
CTEP-AERS report must be submitted electronically to ECOG -ACRIN 
and the appropriate regulatory agencies via the CTEP -AERS Web-
based application located at http://ctep.cancer.gov . 
In the rare event when Internet connectiv ity is disrupted a 24- hour 
notification is to be made by [CONTACT_183434]  
• the AE Team at ECOG -ACRIN (617- 632-3610) for Arm s A, B and 
C and 
• the FDA (1- [PHONE_6611]) for  Arm A  
An electronic report MUST  be submitted immediately upon re-
establishment of internet  connection  
Supporting and follow up data :  Any supporting or follow up 
documentation must be faxed to ECOG -ACRIN ([PHONE_8279]), 
Attention: AE within 48- [ADDRESS_621950] be faxed to  
• the FDA (800- 332-0178),  for Arm A, in the same timeframe.  
NCI Technical Help Desk:  For any technical questions or system 
problems regarding the use of the CTEP -AERS application, please 
contact [CONTACT_394835] [EMAIL_6464] . 
5.2.4  Determination of Reporting Requirements  
Many factors determine the reporting requirements of each individual 
protocol, and which events are reportable in an expeditious manner, 
including:   
• the phase (0, 1, 2, or 3) of the trial   
• whether the patient has received an investigational or commercial 
agent or both  
• the seriousness of the event  
• the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade  Rev. 6/14 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
28 • whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483898]  
• when the adverse event occurred (within [ADDRESS_621951] administration of investigational agent vs. > [ADDRESS_621952] 
administration of investigational agent)  
• the relationship to the study treatment (attribution)  
Using these factors, the instructions and tables in the following 
sections have been customized for protocol E7208 and outline 
the specific expedited adverse event reporting requirements for study E7208.

39 5.4 Dose Modifications  
All toxicities should be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. 
Version 4.0 of the CTCAE is identified and located on the CTEP website at  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.ht
m. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of version 
4.0 of CTCAE.  
5.4.1  General Considerations  
a. A new cycle of treatment may begin when the ANC is ≥ 1,500/mcl, 
the platelet count is ≥ 75,000/mcl, and any treatment -related GI 
toxicity is resolved to ≤ Grade 1.  
b. If the initiation of a new cycle, or treatment during a cycle is 
delayed for ≥ 4 weeks, t he patient should be removed from 
protocol treatment.  
c. Held doses are not to be made up.  
d. If one therapeutic agent is permanently discontinued secondary to 
toxicity, then therapy with the other study agents should continue and the patient should remain on- study with full adherence to all 
protocol -related requirements  
e. In the event of serious or life- threatening conditions, hold the 
offending agent. If the patient is to continue on therapy, all agents should be held until the toxicity resolves to grade < 2. 
f. Dose reductions for all agents are as follows:  
ARM  AGENT  INITIAL DOSE  LEVEL -1 LEVEL -2 
A (IC) Cetuximab  500 mg/m2 400 mg/m2 250 mg/m2 
Irinotecan  180 mg/m2 150 mg/m2 120 mg/m2 
B (ICR)  
Closed to accrual  Ramucirumab  8 mg/kg  6 mg/kg  5 mg/kg  
Cetuximab  500 mg/m2 400 mg/m2 250 mg/m2 
Irinotecan  180 mg/m2 150 mg/m2 120 mg/m2 
C (mICR)  Ramucirumab  6 mg/kg  5 mg/kg  4 mg/kg  
Cetuximab  400 mg/m2 250 mg/m2 200 mg/m2 
Irinotecan  150 mg/m2 120 mg/m2 90 mg/m2 
NOTE:  In the event that an agent is given at dose level ( -2) and dose 
modification rules call for further reduction, the agent should be 
discontinued.  Rev. 12/11, 6/14

40 5.4.2  Hematologic toxicities  
No Ramucirumab or cetuximab dose modifications (or delays) will be 
made for hematologic toxicity.  Continue Ramucirumab or cetuximab

subsequent cycles, continue at the reduced dose levels from the previous cycle.  
5.4.3  Diarrhea 
No Ramucirumab dose delay will be made for diarrhea.  Continue 
Ramucirumab  when other agents are held.  Dose modifications should 
be made for toxicity only when patient is receiving intensive 
loperamide therapy.  
Grade  Dose Modification  
2 Be sure intensive loperamide is being taken. For subsequent cycles, resume 
all agents at the previous dose levels, provided diarrhea has fully resolved 
before restarting treat ment.  
3 Be sure intensive loperamide is being taken. If so, and grade 3 diarrhea lasts 
longer than 48 hours , reduce irinotecan one dose level.  Do not treat again 
until the diarrhea resolves to ≤ grade 2.  
4 Be sure intensive loperamide is being taken.  Hold irinotecan. If diarrhea 
resolves to ≤ grade 2, irinotecan and cetuximab should  be resumed at one 
lower dose level for subsequent cycles. For subsequent cycles, continue both 
agents at the reduced dose levels from the previous cycle.

agents one dose level for all subsequent cycle s. 
5.4.6  Pulmonary Toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS]  For Grade 2 or worsening pulmonary symptoms unrelated 
to underlying cancer, cetuximab treatment should be 
stopped and symptoms investigated. Cetuximab treatment 
may resume at one lower dose level when symptoms 
resolve to ≤ Grade 1 and cetuximab- related pneumonitis is 
ruled out.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  For ≥ Grade 3 cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, pneumonitis, or

5.5.2  Diarrhea Management  
For symptoms of diarrhea and/or abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_246] a treatment cycle with irinotecan, patients will be 
instructed to begin taking loperamide. Loperamide should be started at the earliest sign of (1) a poorly formed or loose stool or (2) the 
occurrence of 1 to 2 more bowel movements than usual in 1 day or (3) an increase in stool volume or liquidity. Loperamide should be taken 
in the following manner: [ADDRESS_621972] sufficient supply on hand in case antidiarrheal 
support is required.  Additional antidiarrheal measures may be used at 
the discretion of the treating physician. Patients should be instructed to increase fluid intake to help maintain fluid and electrolyte balance during epi[INVESTIGATOR_119999].  
5.5.3  Antibiotics  
Oral fluoroquinolone treatment should be initiated for any of the 
following:  
• Diarrhea persisting for more than 24 hours despi[INVESTIGATOR_247]  
•  ANC < 500/mcl (even in the absence of diarrhea or fever)  
•  Fever with diarrhea (even in the absence of neutropenia)  
• Antibiotic therapy should also be initiated in patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483900] (even in the absence of neutropenia).  
5.5.4  Lacrimation, rhinorrhea, miosis, diaphoresis, hot flashes, flushing, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], diarrhea, or other symptoms of early cholinergi c

Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 0.25 -1.0 mg IV or SC may be used to treat these symptoms. 
In patients with troublesome or recurrent symptoms, prophylactic administration of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_483901]. Additional antidiarrheal measures may be used at the 
discretion of the treating physician. Combination anticholinergic 
medications containing barbiturates or other agents (e.g., Donnatal®) 
should not be used because these may affect  irinotecan metabolism. 
Anticholinergics should be used with caution in patients with potential contraindications (e.g., obstructive uropathy, glaucoma, tachycardia, etc.).

ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_621974] – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re- evaluated for response 
every eight  weeks.    
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] 
(RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in  the 
largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the 
shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in RECIST.  
• The following general principles must be followed: 
1. To assess objective response, it is necessary to e stimate the overall 
tumor burden at baseline to which subsequent measurements will be 
compared. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than four weeks  
before registration.  
2. Measurable  disease is defined by [CONTACT_319357].  
3. All measurements should be recorded in metric notation by [CONTACT_2363] a ruler or calipers.  
4. The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize each identified lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_621975] their response classified according to the definitions stated below.   
(NOTE:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to 
the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response  
Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are evaluable but 
do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for non- target lesion assessment .  The 
response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or 
unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_621976] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) 
as ≥ [ADDRESS_621977] x -ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_621978] scan, or ≥ 10 mm 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_621979] be ≥ [ADDRESS_621980] scan (CT 
scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short  axis will be measured and 
followed.  
Non-measurable Disease 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm 
short axis), are considered non- measurable disease. Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as 
non-measurable.  Non- measurable also includes lesions that are < [ADDRESS_621981] x -ray. 
NOTE:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant 
lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of 
measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target  lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducibl e 
repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in 
which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.   
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for 
nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseli ne 
sum of the diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
52 Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the [ADDRESS_621982] be 
used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline 
and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is preferred to 
evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
Clinical Lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm 
in diameter as  assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest X -ray 
Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI   
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_621983] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image 
acquisition variables involved in MRI which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is 
performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of 
disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up 
must be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the 
scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_621984] (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and 
can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET 
portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an 
investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
Ultrasound  
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations 
cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a 
later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken 
from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], conf irmation by [CONTACT_62553].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm 
complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
Tumor Markers  
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific 
guidelines for both CA- 125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and 
PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published 
[JNCI  96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin 
Oncol  26:1148- 1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer 
Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_621985] -line trials in 
ovarian cancer [ JNCI 92:1534- 1535, 2000].  
Cytology, Histology  
These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare case s (e.g., 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
54 residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where 
known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor 
has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. 
FDG -PET 
FDG -PET may not be used as a response assessment in this stud y. 
6.1.4  Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  
Disap pearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction 
in short axis to <  10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters . 
Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression, See Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]
). 
Stable Disease (SD)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
sum diameters while on study. (Note: a change of 20% or 
less that does not increase the sum of the diameters by 5 
mm or more is coded as stable disease)  
To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements 
must have met the stable disease criteria at least once 
after study entry at a minimum interval of eight weeks . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-
pathological in size (<  10 mm short axis)  
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
55 NOTE:  If tumor markers are initial ly above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in complete clinical response. 
Non-CR/Non -PD 
Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits . 
Progressive Disease (PD)  
Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]
). Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.  
When the patient also has measurable disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non -target 
disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest 
“increase”  in the size of one or more on -target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the 
basis of change in non- target disease in the face of SD or 
PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
When the patient only has non- measurable disease, the 
increase in overall disease burden should be c omparable 
in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease:  i.e., an  increase in 
tumor burden from “trace” to “large” , an increase in nodal  
disease from “localized” to “widespread”, or an increase sufficient to  requi re a change in therapy.  
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is 
exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_147782], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463]  (or 
Principal Investigator).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of New Lesions  
The appearance of new lesions constitutes Progressive Disease (PD). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded 
from the start of the treatment until di sease 
progression/recurrence or non -protocol therapy (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the

made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
Duration of Response  
Duration of Overall Response 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are  met for CR or PR (whichever is 
first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date 
that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
Duration of Stable Disease 
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the crit eria for progression are met, taking as 
reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements 
must have met the stable disease criteria at least once 
after study entry at a minimum interval  of eight weeks.

59 8. Drug Formulation and Procurement  
8.1 Irinotecan (CPT -11) (NSC -616348)  
Other Names   Irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate [CPT- 1 1, (4S) -4, 1 1 - diethyl -
4-hydroxy -9- [(4-pi[INVESTIGATOR_483912]) carbonyloxy] -IHpyroano [3',4':6, 7l 
indolzino [1 ,2 -bl quino line- 3, 14(4H, l2H)dione hydrochloride trihydrate] is a 
topoisomerase I inhibitor.  
8.1.1  Classification  
Topoisomerase I inhibitor   
8.1.2  Toxicology  
Human Toxicity: Virtually all Phase I and II studies of irinotecan have 
reported neutropenia and diarrhea as the dose- limiting toxicities. It is 
expected that these toxicities will also be encountered in this trial. 
Other Grade 2- [ADDRESS_621991] also been  
reported.  
8.1.3  Mode of Action 
Causes single stranded DNA breakage by [CONTACT_483940] -1.  Leads to apoptotic cell death 
via defects in DNA repair.  
8.1.4  P harmacology  
Pharmacokinetics : Several studies describing the pharmacokinetic 
characteristics of irinotecan (CPT- 11) and its active metabolite, SN -
38, when administered alone or in combination with other agents 
(including cisplatin) in patients with small cell or non- small cell lung 
cancer have been reported in published literature.  CPT- 11 is 
converted by [CONTACT_483941], SN -38. 
In vitro, SN- 38 is 250 to 1,000 fold more potent than CPT- 11 in the 
inhibition of topoisomerase I activity.  A reversible, pH- dependent 
hydrolysis converts the closed lactone E ring form of both CPT- 11 and 
SN-38 to the open, carboxylate form of each compound. Only the 
closed ring ( lactone) forms of CPT -11 and SN -38 are effective 
topoisomerase I inhibitors. The mean terminal half -life of SN -38 in 
plasma is slightly longer than that for CPT- 11; 11.5 ± 3.8 hours versus 
6.3 ± 2.[ADDRESS_621992] that the 
liver may concentrate, convert CPT- 11 to SN-38, and eliminate both 
compounds as well as the glucuronide conjugate of SN -38 (SN -38G) 
via biliary secretion. In rats, 55% of radiolabeled CPT- 11 was 
excreted unchanged in the bile within 24 hours, while 21.7% was 
transformed to SN -38. It recently was  demonstrated that plasma 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
60 concentrations of SN -38G in patients occur 0.5 to 3 hr after the SN38 
peak and plasma levels generally exceeded that of SN -38.  Overall, 
73% of the radioactivity could be recovered from the feces of rats and 
25% from the urine. Bi le concentrations of CPT- [ADDRESS_621993] 6 hours following administration, while bile concentrations of SN -38 
were 2 to 9 fold higher.  Renal clearance has not been reported to be 
a ma jor route of elimination for these compounds in humans.  
8.1.5  Formulation  
The drug is supplied in two forms: [ADDRESS_621994] three years at room temperature. Irinotecan is stable for 24 hours in glass bottles or plastic bags after reconstitution 
with D5W.  
8.1.7  Dose Specifics  
[IP_ADDRESS]  rms A (IC) and B (ICR)  
Irinotec an will be given at a dose of 180 mg/m
2 
intravenously over 60- 90 minute s every 2 weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Arm C  (mICR)  
Irinotecan will be given at a dose of 15 0 mg/m2 
intravenously over 60- [ADDRESS_621995] party.  This drug will not be supplied by [CONTACT_6812].  
8.1.12  Side Effects  
Hematologic: Leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenic fever, hemorrhage  Rev. 6/14 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
61 Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea (early and late – see administration above), 
nausea and vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, flatulence, s tomatitis, 
dyspepsia, dehydration 
Hepatic: Elevated transaminases.  
Cardiovascular:  Vasodilation, hypotension, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, edema  
CNS:  Dizziness, confusion, somnolence, insomnia, back pain  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: Pulmonary embolism,  
Dermatologic:  Alopecia, rash  
Other: Asthenia, thrombophlebitis, sweating, weight loss, chills  
8.1.13  Nursing/Patient Implications  
Premedicate with antiemetics in anticipation of mild to moderate 
nausea and vomiting.  When used in combination with 5- fluroruracil 
and leucovorin the nausea and vomiting will likely be worse.  
Fatalities have been reported with thromboembolic events and 
neutropenic sepsis in patients receiving 5- fluorouracil, leucovorin and 
irinotecan.  
Monitor for diarrhea. Diarrhea occurring within one hour of irinotecan has been treated with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 0.[ADDRESS_621996] loose stool following the 
irinotecan (see Section 5.5.2
). 
Monitor CBC, platelets, and liver function tests.  
Dose modifications per the protocol or the package insert should be followed for hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity.  
Advise patient of likely post -treatment neutropenia and instruct in 
appropriate neutropenic precautions.  
Administration of an oral quinolone antibiotic may decrease the risk of neutropenic sepsis in patients receiving 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin and 
irinotecan.  
8.2 Cetuximab  
8.2.1  IMC-C225, Erbitux®, NSC -714692 
8.2.2  Classification  
Anti-EGF Receptor antibody  
8.2.3  Mode of Action  
Cetuximab, a chimerized antibody of the IgG 1 subclass, was originally 
derived from a mouse myeloma cell line. Cetuximab was genetically 
engineered by [CONTACT_483942] 1 heavy chain. The 
chimerization resulted in an antibody with binding affinity to epi[INVESTIGATOR_483913] -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
62 growth factor receptors (EGFR) greater than the natural ligand 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF). Cetuximab blocks binding of EGF  and 
transforming growth factor alpha (TGF α) to EGFR and inhibits ligand-
induced activation of  this tyrosine kinase receptor.  Cetuximab also 
stimulates EGFR internalization, effectively removing the receptor 
from the cell surface for interaction with ligand.  
8.2.4  Storage and Stability  
Cetuximab is an anti -EGFR human- to-murine chimeric antibody. 
Cetuximab is expressed in SP2/0 myeloma cell line, grown in large scale cell culture bioreactors and purified to a high level purity using several purification steps including protein A chromatography, ion 
exchange chromatography, low pH treatment and nanofiltration. 
Cetuximab is not known to be a vesicant.  
Store vials under refrigeration at 2° C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). DO NOT 
FREEZE. Increased particulate formation may occur at temperatures 
at or below 0° C. This product contains no preservatives. Preparations 
of cetuximab in infusion containers are chemically and physically stable for up to 12 hours at 2° C to 8°C (36°F to 46° F) and up to 8 
hours at controlled room temperature (20° C to 25°C; 68°F to 77°F). 
Discard any remaining solution in the infusion container after 8 hours at controlled room temperature or after 12 hours at 2° C to 8°C.  
Discard any unused portion of the vial.  
8.2.5  Dose Specifics  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Arms A (IC) and B (ICR)  
Cetuximab will be given as a 500 mg/m
2 dose every 2 
weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Arm C  (mICR)  
Cetuximab will be given as a 400 mg/m2 dose every [ADDRESS_621997] is formulated to 2 mg protein/mL  with phosphate buffered 
saline, pH 7.2 ± 0.2 and aseptically filled into sterile glass vials, 100 
mg per 50 cc vial, and stored as a liquid at 2 to 8 °C. Each vial 
contains the following active and inactive ingredients per 1.0 mL: 2 mg 
of cetuximab, 145 nmol/L sodium chloride, and 10 mmol/L sodium 
phosphate.  
Preparation and Administration: Cetuximab is supplied as a 50 -mL, 
single -use vial containing 100 mg of cetuximab at a concentration of 2 
mg/m L in phosphate buffered saline. The solution should be clear and 
colorless and may contain a small amount of easily visible white amorphous cetuximab particulates. DO NOT SHAKE OR DILUTE. 
• Cetuximab must not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  
• Cetuximab must be administered with the use of a low protein binding 0.22- micrometer in -line filter.  Rev. 6/14 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
63 Cetuximab can be administered via infusion pump. 
8.2.7  Route of Administration  
Administration of Cetuximab: In an effort to prevent a hypersensitivity 
reaction, all patients should be premedicated with diphenhydramine 
hydrochlor ide 50 mg (or an equivalent antihistamine) by [CONTACT_483943] [ADDRESS_621998] dose of cetuximab.  Premedication may be administered prior to subsequent doses, but at the Investigator’s discretion, the dose of diphenhydramine (or a similar agent) may be 
reduced.  
The initial dose of cetuximab is 400 mg/m2 or 500 mg/m2 as assigned 
intravenously administered over AT LEAST 120 minutes, followed by 
[CONTACT_483944] 2 weeks . Cetuximab should not be 
given at a rate faster than 5 ml/min for the first dose. Patient s 
must be continuously observed during the infusion for signs of 
anaphylaxis.  
Patient s will be closely monitored for treatment -related adverse 
events, especially hypersensitivity reactions, during the infusion and the post -infusion observation hour. For the duration that patient s are 
on study therapy, adverse event monitoring will be done continuously. Patient s will be evaluated for adverse events at each visit and are to 
be instructed to call their physician to report any clinically signif icant 
adverse events between visits.  
Severe infusion reactions occurred with the administration of 
cetuximab in approximately 3% (17/633)  of patients, rarely with fatal 
outcome (< 1 in 1,000). Approximately 90% of severe infusion reactions were associated with the first infusion of cetuximab despi[INVESTIGATOR_483914]. These reactions were 
characterized by [CONTACT_483945] 
(bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), urticaria and/or hypotension. Caution must be exercised with every cetuximab infusion, as there 
were patients who experienced their first severe infusion reaction 
during later infusions.  
Cetuximab can be administered via infusion pump or syringe pump.  
Infusion Pump:  
1. Draw up the volume of a vial using a sterile sy ringe attached to an 
appropriate needle (a vented spi[INVESTIGATOR_483915]).  
2. Fill cetuximab into a sterile evacuated container or bag such as 
glass containers, polyolefin bags (e.g., Baxter Intravia), ethylene 
vinyl acetate bags (e.g., Baxter Clintec), DEHP plasticized PVC bags (e.g., Abbott Lifecare), or PVC bags . 
3. Repeat procedure until the calculated volume has been put in to the container.  Use a new needle for each vial.  
4. Administer through a low protein binding 0.22 -microme ter in -line 
filter (placed as proximal to the patient as practical). Rev. 12/11  Rev. 12/14

Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
64 5. Affix the infusion line and prime it with cetuximab before starting 
the infusion.  
6. Maximum infusion rate should not exceed 5 mL/min.  
7. Use 0.9% saline solution to flush line at the end of infusion. 
Cetuximab should be pi[INVESTIGATOR_483916]’s infusion line.  Following the cetuximab infusion, a 1- hour observation period is 
recommended.

Cetuximab was studied in combination with irinotecan (n=354) or as 
monotherapy (n=279).  Patients receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan 
received a median of 12 doses (with 88/354 [25%] treated for over 6 months), and patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy received a median of 7 doses (with 26/279 [9%] treated for over 6 months).  The 
population had a median age of 59 and was 60% male and 91% 
Caucasian.  The range of dosing for patients receiving cetuximab plus 
irinotecan was 1- [ADDRESS_622000] serious adverse reactions associated with cetuximab 
were:    
Infusion reaction (3%);

Interstitial lung disease (0.5%);  
Fever (5%);  
Sepsis (3%);  
Kidney failure (2%);  
Pulmonary embolus (1%);

Diarrhea (6%) in patients receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan, 0% in 
patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy.  
Thirty -seven (10%) patients receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan and 
14 (5%) patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy discontinued 
treatment primarily because of adverse events.  
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_622001] common adverse events seen in 354 patients receiving 
cetuximab plus irinotecan were acneiform rash (88%), 
asthenia/malaise (73%), diarrhea (72%), nausea (55%), abdominal pain (45%), and vomiting (41%).  
The most common adverse events seen in 279 patients r eceiving 
ERBITUX monotherapy were acneiform rash (90%), asthenia/malaise 
(49%), fever (33%), nausea (29%), constipation (28%), and diarrhea (28%).  
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot 
be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and 
may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction 
information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for 
identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use 
and for approximating rates.

67 8.2.11  Nursing/Patient Implications  
Resuscitation equipment and medications to treat hypersensitivity 
reactions should be available during and for one hour following each 
cetuximab infusion.  
Blood pressure, pulse and temperature should be taken pre- infusion, 
at mid point, end of infusion and one hour post- infusion.  
Patients should be observed for 1 hour following the initial dose and 
30 minutes following the weekly doses.  
Patients should be observed for signs of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis.  
Safety Precautions  
Appropriate mask, protective clothing, eye protection, gloves, and Class II vertical -laminar -airflow safety cabinets are recommended 
during preparation and handling.  Opened vials must be disposed of at 
the investigational center as chemotherapy or biohazardous w aste 
provided documented procedures for destruction are in place.  For 
questions regarding cetuximab destruction please contact [CONTACT_483946]_usmail- [EMAIL_9307]
. 
Cetuximab therapy should be used  with caution in patients with known 
hypersensitivity to cetuximab, murine proteins, or any component of this product.  
It is recommended that patients wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure while receiving cetuximab as sunlight can exacerbate any s kin reactions that may occur.

Ramucirumab , 1121B  
8.3.2  Classification:  
Recombinant anti- VEGF human monoclonal antibody  
8.3.3  Mode of Action:  
IMC-1121B is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 
subclass  that specifically binds to t he extracellular domain of the 
VEGFR- 2. This antibody effectively blocks VEGF/VEGFR -2 
interaction, inhibits VEGF- stimulated activation of VEGFR -2 and 
p44/p42 mitogen- activated protein kinases, and neutralizes VEGF-
induced mitogenesis of human endothelial c ells. 
8.3.4  Storage and Stability  
Chemical and physical in -use stability has been demonstrated for up 
to 24 hours below 25°C (77°F). DO NOT FREEZE  OR SHAKE  IMC-
1121B.  From a microbiological point of view, the prepared product 
should be used immediately.  If not used immediately, in- use storage

72 9. Statistical Considerations 
9.1 Revised Statistical Design - Arms A (IC) and C (mICR)  
Safety Monitoring  
The revised investigational regimen (that is, Arm C (mICR) , a revision of the 
previous investigational  Arm B) will be examined among the first [ADDRESS_622010] few months after 
reactivation, the study team will convene calls every two weeks. 
The toxic death rate on Arm B (ICR) prior to study suspension was 2/16 patients or 12.5%. With 16 patients on Arm C (mICR) evaluated under the new regimen 
the probability of observing 1 or more toxic deaths is 81.5% if the true toxic death 
rate is 10% and 88.2% under a true toxic death rate of 12.5%. No toxic deaths were observed in Arm A prior to suspension among 17 treated patients. Under 
the revised design with 16 patients evaluated on Arm C (mICR) the probability of observing one or more toxic deaths under a true toxic death rate of 0.77% is 
11.6%. If one or more toxic deaths occur at any point during the 16 patient 
evaluation of Arm C, the study will close to accrual and the regimen will be 
abandoned.  
The safety evaluation will also closely assess all treatment- related toxicities other 
than those of grade 5 with a particular emphasis on evaluating grade 3 and 4 events. Prior to suspension the grade 3 or higher treatment -related adverse 
event rate on Arm A was 16.7%. With 16 patients on Arm C there is 81% power to detect a true grade 3 or higher toxicity rate of 39% (versus a null of 16.7%) 
and 90% power to detect a true rate of 44% using a one -sided exact binomial 
test at the 11% significance level (evaluating Arm C separately as the power for 
the two- group comparison is limited). The observed grade 3 or higher toxicity rate 
on Arm B was 87.5%. If the grade [ADDRESS_622011] is significant after 16 patients on Arm C, the study will suspend accrual and the feasibility of the 
revised regimen will be evaluated by [CONTACT_483947], including a detailed review of all grade 3 or higher treatment related 
events.  In addition to the above safety monitoring plan, the study will suspend 
upon the report of any colonic perforation event, regardless of treatment attribution or grade. A detailed review of the circumstances surrounding the event 
will be conducted and, in the case of the event occurring on Arm C, the feasibility of the revised regimen will be evaluated by [CONTACT_483948]. 
The colonic perforation rate on Arm B (ICR) prior to study suspension was 2/16 
patients or 12.5%. With 16 patients on Arm C (mICR) evaluated under the new Rev. 6/14, 6/14

ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
73 regimen the probability of observing 1 or more colonic perforations is 81.5% if the 
true rate is 10% and 88.2% under a rate of 12.5%. No toxic deaths were 
observed in Arm A prior to suspension among 17 treated patients.  
In addition, the evaluation of 16 patients randomized to Arm C wi ll allow 
estimation of any given toxicity with a 90% confidence interval that is no wider 
than 44.3 percentage points and there is 56.0% probability of observing any 
given event (1 or more out of 16 patients) with a true frequency of 5% and 81.5% probabili ty observing 1 or more events with true frequency of 10%.  
Primary Efficacy Design  
Patients will be randomized equally  between the two treatment arms A (IC) and 
C (mICR) with stratification based on performance status (0 vs. 1), 
discontinuation of oxaliplatin before disease progression (Yes vs. No), and time frame of progression (within [ADDRESS_622012] treatment vs. > [ADDRESS_622013] 
treatment). Patients previously randomized to arms A and B before the redesign 
of the experimental regimen will not be part of the formal efficacy evaluation and 
will be reported separately.  
With 48 eligible patients per arm followed for progression- free survival (disease 
progression or death without evidence of progression), this study has over 85% power to detect a difference of 4.5 months median PFS in the control arm  A 
(40% PFS at 6 months assuming exponential failure) versus 7.65 months median PFS (58% PFS at 6 months) in the experimental arm (Arm C) using a one -sided 
stratified log rank test conducted with 15 % type 1 error. The study will require 
approximately 10 months of accrual at 10 patients per month and 6 additional 
months of follow- up to achieve the events required ( 67 PFS events) to provide at 
least 85% power for the stated alternative of a 48% increase in median PFS. 
Response, overall survival, and toxicity are secondary endpoints and will be 
reported at the time of primary PFS analysis .  With 48 eligible patients per arm, 
the width of any 90% confidence interval on a binomial proportion will be no wider than 26 percentage points.  In addition, the probability of observing a rare 
(2% probability) toxicity in either arm is greater than 62% at full accrual. Allowing 
for roughly 5% ineligibility  and including the 35 patients who were previously 
randomized to Arms A and B of the study prior to its redesign, this s tudy will 
require a total of 135  patients  and 100 patients will be accrued to the revised 
study (Arm A versus Arm C) . 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_253086] -ACRIN  Data  Safety  Monitoring 
Committee (D SMC) for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_483920]. One interim 
stratified log rank test for efficacy will be performed at 60% PFS information ( 40 
PFS events), expected to occur roughly at the time accrual completes and six 
months before full information is achieved. Type I error control will be accomplished using an O'Brien- Fleming type boundary, with Lan -Demets use 
function methodology to adjust the boundary for the exact information time achieved at the interim analysis. If the study is positive, the DSMC  may 
recommend early reporting; there is at least 55% probability of rejecting the null 
at the interim analysis if the alternative hypothesis is true. At the interim analysis time, the PFS hazard ratio will also be computed from a stratified proportional 
hazards  regression model. If the HR exceeds 1 (that is, evidence that PFS is 
worse in the experimental A rm C), the DSMC  may recommend abandoning the 
regimen and early reporting of negative results. The effect of the interim analysis 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, 2016 
74 on the operating characteristics of the trial is fairly small (less than 1% absolute 
effect on significance level and power).  
Additional Safety Monitoring 
In addition to the safety monitoring that will occur in the first 16 patients 
randomized to Arm C (described above), interim analy ses of toxicity are 
performed twice yearly for all ECOG -ACRIN  studies. Reports of these analyses 
are sent to the ECOG -ACRIN Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_483921]. Expedited reporting of certain adverse events is 
required, as described in Section 5.2 and ECOG -ACRIN Operations Office – 
[LOCATION_011]’s real -time monitoring of events through CTEP -AERS report notifications 
will be in place for this trial. This system provides monthly  notifications to the 
study chair, study statistician and independent toxicity monitor of certain 
reportable grade 4 or higher events and all grade 5 events.  
9.2 Original Statistical Design (Arms A and B)  
Patients will be randomized equally  between the two treatment arms with 
stratification based on performance status (0 vs. 1), discontinuation of oxaliplatin before disease progression (Yes vs. No), and time frame of progression (within [ADDRESS_622014] treatment vs. > [ADDRESS_622015] treatment). With 70 eligible 
patients per arm followed for progression -free survival (disease progression or 
death without evidence of progression), this study has 90% power to detect a 
difference of 4.5 months median PFS in the control arm (40% PFS at 6 months 
assuming exponential failure) versus 7.65 months median PFS (58% PFS at 6 months) in the experimental arm using a one -sided log rank test conducted with 
10% type 1 error.  The study will require approximately 7 months of accrual at 20 patients per month and 7 additional  months of follow -up to achieve the events 
required (100 PFS events) to provide 90% power for the stated alternative of a 70% increase in median PFS.  Response, overall survival, and toxicity are 
secondary endpoints and will be reported at the time of primary PFS analysis .  
With 70 eligible patients per arm, the width of any 90% confidence interval on a binomial proportion will be no wider than 21 percentage points.  In addition, the 
probability of observing a rare (1% probability) toxicity in either arm is  greater 
than 50% at full accrual. Allowing for 5% ineligibility, this study will require a total of 147 patients.  
Safety Monitoring  
Interim analyses of toxicity are performed twice yearly for all ECOG -ACRIN 
studies. Reports of these analyses are sent to t he ECOG -ACRIN Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_404106]. Expedited reporting of certain adverse events is required, as described in Section 5.2
 and 
ECOG -ACRIN Operations Off ice – [LOCATION_011]’s real -time monitoring of events 
through CTEP -AERS report notifications will be in place for this trial. This system 
provides monthly notifications to the study chair, study statistician and 
independent toxicity monitor of certain reportable grade 4 or higher events and all 
grade 5 events.   
In addition to ECOG -ACRIN ’s routine semi -annual reporting of case report form 
toxicities through interim study reports and real -time monitoring of adverse 
events through CTEP -AERS , this study will include a detailed toxicity review of 
both treatment arms after [ADDRESS_622016] been treated with at Rev. 12/11  Rev. 6/14 Rev. 6/14 
ECOG -ACRIN  E7208  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_622017] been submitted to the ECOG -ACRIN Operations Office – [LOCATION_011]. 
The study statistician will prepare a report of all case report form and CTEP -
AERS reportable events for review by [CONTACT_483949]. The study will remain suspended until the review is complete.  
With 20 patients per arm, there is greater than 55% probability of observing one 
or more rare (true probability of 4%) toxicities on either arm and greater than 
87% chance of observing one or more toxicities with true rate in excess of 10%. 
If 4 or more  patients experience grade 4 or worse treatment -related events in an 
arm, consideration will be given to closing the trial or modifying the treatment 
regimens . Under this monitoring rule, there is less than 2% probability of meeting 
the monitoring boundary if the true grade 4 or higher toxicity probabi lity is 5% but 
89% chance of meeting the boundary if the true probability is 30%. For other true 
grade 4 probabilities of 10%, 20% and 25%, the corresponding probabilities of reaching the boundary  are 13%, 59% and 77%, respectively. Toxicity analyses 
will be conducted separately in each arm.   In addition to grade [ADDRESS_622018] to all grade toxicities, grade 
3-4 toxicities, and non -hematologic toxicities will be assessed. If it is deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_3476]/independent toxicity monitors, an additional interim 
safely assessment will be conducted.  
Grade 5 events will also be separately monitored and reported. The recently reported EPIC trial (Sobrero et al., 2008) observed a toxic death rate of 0.77% in 
the cetuximab plus irinotecan arm (5 deaths among 650 patients). Taking 0.77% as the null toxic death rate for either arm in this trial and 5% or higher as an 
unacceptable alternative toxic death rate, we will consider modifying or closing 
the trial if in either arm [ADDRESS_622019] 20 treated patients. Under the null hypothesis there is a 14% 
probability of observing one or more grade [ADDRESS_622020] 20 patients and 
64% probability under the alternative. If the true grade 5 event rate is as high as 
10%, there is 88% probability of observing [ADDRESS_622021] 20 
patients treated on an arm. In addition to the toxicity analysis at suspension, grade 5 events will be continuously moni tored, reported and reviewed as 
indicated above. At full accrual, the probability of observing 2 or more grade 5 events out of 70 patients in an arm is 10% under the null hypothesis and 87% 
under the alternative hypothesis.  
9.3 Study Monitoring  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_253086] -ACRIN  Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee ( DSMC). The DSMC meets twice each year. For each meeting, all 
monitored studies are reviewed for safety and progress toward completion. When appropriate, the DSMC  will also review interim an alyses of outcome data. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_483922] -ACRIN group meeting (except that for double 
blind studies, the DSMC may review unblinded toxicity data, while only  pooled or 
blinded data will be made public). These group meeting reports are made available to the local investigators, who may provide them to their IRBs. Only the 
study statistician and the DSMC members will have access to interim analyses of Rev. 6/14

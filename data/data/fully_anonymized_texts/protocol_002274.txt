Date:  05-Jun-[ADDRESS_1132064] is MEDI4736 which will be supplied in glass vials containing 500 mg of 
liquid solution at a concentration of 5 0 mg/mL for intravenous  (IV) administration.  
 
Routine, standard of care chemotherapy will be given together with the investigational product and will 
include weekly nab-paclitaxel  x12 treatments  followed by [CONTACT_817623] -week doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide (ddAC) x 4 treatments .  
   
Research Hypothesis : Our hypotheses are : (i) Anti-PD-L1 therapy with MEDI4736 administered 
concomitantly with weekly nab -paclitaxel followed by [CONTACT_46054]4736 concomitant with ddAC neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy will induce higher pathologic complete response ( pCR) rate (>55%) in triple negative 
breast cancer  than historical pCR rates  (30-40%)  observed with chemotherapy alone . (ii) W e also 
hypothesize that MEDI4736 can be safely co -administered at full dose with  sequential with nab -
paclitaxel (100mg/m2) and ddAC (60 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2 respectively)  
Objectives:  
1. Primary Objectives:   
2. The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the trial is to assess the safety of MEDI4736 combined 
with chemotherapy and determine if full dose of MEDI4736 can be administered concomitantly with 
full dose weekly nab -paclitaxel followed by [CONTACT_2715]-dense AC chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , respectively .   
The primary objective of the Phase II portion of the study is to estimate the pCR rate w ith MEDI4736 
in combination with weekly nab -paclitaxel x 12 treatments followed by [CONTACT_46054]4736 in combination 
with ddAC  x 4 treatments for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 negative 
(triple negative, TNBC), clinical stage I -III breas t cancer. Pathologic complete response  is defined as 
the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast 
specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy 
(i.e. ypT0/Tis ypN0).  
Secondary Objectives :  
To assess the safety and toxicity of adding anti -PD-L1 antibody, MEDI4736 to standard of care 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the Phase II portion of the trial. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_817624], Version 4.3. We will also monitor for events of 
special clinical interest with a suspected auto -immunologic etiology including grade ≥3 colitis, 
hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, rash and a nti-drug-antibody (ADA) 
immune complex disease (manifested by [CONTACT_817625], abdominal pain, back pain, and 
vasculitis). For patients included in the Phase II portion of the trial, toxicity will be reported separately 
for acute toxicities observe d on-therapy and for delayed toxicities observed during a 90 -day follow up 
period after completion of therapy. Acute toxicities will also be reported separately for the combination 
with nab -paclitaxel and dose dense AC parts of the treatment.

 Study Assessments and Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety Assessments:  
Toxicities will be assessed every two weeks before each administration of MEDI4736 by [CONTACT_817627]. Grading of 
toxicities will be according to the NCI CTCAE v 5.0.  
During the Phase I portion of the study dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will be considered during the 
entire 20 weeks of therapy  for determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose/Recommended Phase [ADDRESS_1132074] safety assessment will be 90 days after completion of neoadjuvant therapy . For 
definitions of DLT see section 6.4  
Efficacy Assessments:  
The primary efficacy endpoint of pCR will be assessed in the surgically resected cancer and lymph 
nodes after completion of all chemotherapy by [CONTACT_817628]. Pathologic 
complete response is defined as no invasive cancer in the resected breast tissue and lymph nodes  
(ypT0/Tis, ypN0) . This information will be extracted from the pathology report  and patients will be 
assigned to one of two response c ategories, pCR or residual disease (RD) for the purpose of primary 
efficacy analysis.  
Pharmacodynamic / Pharmacokinetic Assessments (if applicable):  
61T61T61 TPK studies will not be  performed . 
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  
61T61T61 TThe Phase I portion of the trial will follow the 3+3 design . 
61T61T61 TThe Phase II portion will follow Simon’s two -stage design . 
 
Efficacy Analysis  
All patients who received at  least 12 weeks of therapy (i.e. 6 courses) with MEDI4736 at the 
recommended Phase II dose will be included in the primary efficacy analysis . A secondary, intent to 
treat, efficacy analysis will also be performed and will include all patients who received at last one 
dose of MEDI4736  at the recommen ded Phase II dose .  
Safety Analysis and Toxicity Reporting  
All patients who received at least one dose of MEDI4736 will be included in toxicity analysis. 
Toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v 5.0.

 During the Phase I portion of the study do se limiting toxicities (DLT) will be considered during the 
entire 20 weeks of therapy for determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose/Recommended Phase 2 
Dose (MTD/RP2D). Definition of DLT/RP2D  
During the Phase II portion of the trial, c umulative t oxicity  results over the entire duration of therapy 
will be reported. Toxicity will also be reported separately for acute (on -treatment) and delayed (within 
90 days after completion of treatment) toxicities and acute toxicities will be reported separately for the  
combination of MEDI4736 with nab -paclitaxel and the combination of MEDI4736 with dose -dense 
AC.  
Toxicit ies will be reported as frequency statistics with 95% confidence intervals.  
Statistical Plan of Exploratory Biomarker Analysis  
The following immune parameters , in order of priority in case of limited tissue availability,  will be 
assessed using qu antitative immunohistochemistry  in base line core needle biopsies: PD1 (programmed 
death receptor 1) and PD -L1 and -L2 (programmed death receptor ligan ds 1 and 2), CD3+, CD4+, 
CD8+, CD1 37, FOXP3, OX40, CTLA4 and GITR . Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) count will be 
estimated from an H&E section and quantified as the percent of stromal cells that are lymphocytes. 
Multivariate associations of these immun e markers as continuous variables and pCR as dichotomous 
variable will be evaluated with logistic regression using backward feature elimination (LR test <0.05). 
Clinical tumor size, clinical nodal status and age will also be included in the model.  
RNA expr ession profiling will also be performed on all base line core needle biopsy samples to assess 
associations between pCR and published immune gene signatures. The [ADDRESS_1132075] cell types including plasma cells (IGG 
metagene), T -cells (CD8A metagene) and antigen -presenting cells (MHC2 metagene) and also capture 
important immune regulatory pat hways such as MHC1 gene expression (MHC1 meta gene), STAT1 
co-expressed genes (STAT1 metagene) and interferon -inducible genes (IF -I metagene  including IFNg) 
and chemokine signaling through CXCL9 and CXCL1 . These metagenes were selected because they 
have bee n repeatedly observed in gene expression data, can be assessed reliably and carry prognostic 
value. Multivariate associations of these immune metagenes as continuous variables and pCR as 
dichotomous variable will be evaluated with logistic regression using  backward feature elimination 
(LR test <0.05). Clinical tumor size, clinical nodal status and age will also be included in the model.

 Whole exome DNA sequencing will also be performed to identify somatic mutations and other 
alterations that could be potential novel predictive markers of response. These will represent 
exploratory analysis. Sequencing will be performed at the Yale Center for Genome analysis with 
average depths o f UUU> UUU150x. We will use the Fisher Exact test, which evaluates the significance for over -
representation of a specific genomic alteration in the pCR versus no -pCR groups, to assess potential 
association between functional variants in immune genes and re sponse. Due to the sparsely of data at 
individual variant level, we will aggregate high functional impact variants at gene le vel and also at 
pathway level.  
 
Selected immune parameters will also be assessed in residual cancer specimens in cases with less th an 
pCR to assess changes in the immune microenvironment in response to therapy using pair -wise t -test 
and Bonferroni adjustment of p -values for multiple testing. Correlation coefficients will also be 
calculated for immune parameters between baseline and re sidual disease samples.     
 
Sample Size Determination:  Total sample size is a minimum of 24 and maximum of 71 patients  
including both Phase I and phase II portions and allowing for replacement of non -evaluable patients for 
efficacy at a 10 % loss rate. 
Phase I safety portion of the trial  
Two dose levels will be assessed including 3mg/kg and 10mg/kg MEDI4736 in combination with 
weekly nab -paclitaxel x 12 treatments followed by [CONTACT_46054]4736 in combination with ddAC x 4 
treatments.   
UUU3 mg/kg MEDI4736  dose level  
The first 3 patients will be enrolled a t dose level of 3 mg/kg MEDI4736  concomitant with 
chemotherapy. Further accrual will be halted after the first 3 patients are enrolled until the DLT 
assessment is complete for a given treatment part of the two -part (weekly nab -paclitaxel x 12 + AC x 
4) chemotherapy regimen . If no patien ts experience a  DLT  during the weekly nab -paclitaxel treatment 
period ( 12 weeks), the next 3 patients will start weekly nab -paclitaxel at the next dose level, 10 mg/kg , 
while the previous cohort is still receiving AC chemotherapy (with MEDI4736 at 3 mg/kg) . If 1 patient 
experiences DLT  during either the nab -paclitaxel or AC parts of the therapy , 3 additional patients will 
be enrolled at the 3 mg/kg dose -level  in combination with the chemotherapy part of interest . If none of 
these 3 additional patients exper ience DLT (i.e. the final observed DLT rate is 1 of 6), the dose is 
escalated to 10 mg/kg  for the given chemotherapy part . If [ADDRESS_1132076] 6 patients treated at the 3 mg/kg dose level, the study will be halted and dose de-escalation will 
be considered as an amendment to the trial after consultation with the sponsor. If [ADDRESS_1132077] 3 patients treated at 3 mg/kg dose level, the study will also be halted 
and dose de -escalation will be c onsidered as an amendment to the trial.

 Using the above design, the probabilities of halting dose escalation , in each treatment part,  for true 
rates of DLT ranging from 5% to 70% are as follows:  
True rate of DLT:    5%   10%    20%    30%   40%   50%   60%    70%

UUU10 mg/kg MEDI473 6 dose level  
If dose escalation is feasible, the next cohort of patients will receive MEDI473 6 at 10 mg/kg dose 
concomitant with chemotherapy. Accrual will be halted after the first 3 patient s are enrolled at the 10 
mg/kg d ose until DLT assessment is complete for nab -paclitaxel (i.e. all [ADDRESS_1132078] completed 12 
weeks of nab -paclitaxel chemothe rapy). If  only [ADDRESS_1132079] 3 patients are 
treated at this dose level, the study will proceed to enroll 3 additional patients at the 10 mg/kg dose 
level  in combination with nab -paclitaxel . If none or only 1 of these additional  3 patients show DLT 
(final observed DLT 1 of 6), this dose level will be moved forward to the Phase II portion for efficacy 
assessment  and accrual will start on the nab -paclitaxel part of treatment while patients are completing 
the AC part of their therap y. If [ADDRESS_1132080] 6 patients treated at 
the 10 mg/kg dose level, the dose will be de -escalated to 3 mg/kg and this dose is designated as the 
RP2D for the subsequent Phase II portion of the trial. If [ADDRESS_1132081] 3 experience 
DLT, the dose will be de -escalated to 3 mg/kg dose and this dose will be moved forward to the Phase 
II po rtion for efficacy assessment. DLT will be assessed similarly and the same expansion rules will be 
followed during the AC  part of the treatment.  
Two -stage Phase II portion of the trial   
The interim efficacy and toxicity analyse s will be performed after the first [ADDRESS_1132082] 12 
weeks (i.e. 6 courses) of MEDI4736 are also not eligible for efficacy analysis  but will be included in 
the toxicity assessment . Trial accrual will continue while efficacy and toxicity da ta is accumulating for 
the 22 patients.  
The trial will terminate for lack of efficacy if < [ADDRESS_1132083] 22 experience pCR (Alpha = 
beta = 10%, probability of early termination if the response rate is 30%=0.67). If > 7 patients 
experience pCR , accrual will continue until a maximum of 50 patients are accrued.  
Safety analysis: If > 2/22 patients experience DLT or a serious treatment related adverse event (SAE), 
the MEDI4736 dose schedule will  be re -evaluated. If futility criteria is not met (i.e. >7/[ADDRESS_1132084]

African American extension cohort  
We will perform one additional efficacy analysis which includes assessing pCR rates in A frican 
America (AA)  and non -AA patients separately in the Phase II portion of the trial. In order to make this 
exploratory analysis, we need at least N=20 AA  patients accrued to the study. An AA only extension

size to a total of 71 (as of October 8, 2018; [ADDRESS_1132087]  been accrued and the total accrual

binomial test. This is a  similar magnitude of improvement, a near doubling of pCR rate, as was 
observed when trastuzumab was added to paclitaxel/AC neoadjuvant chemotherapy in H ER2 positive 
breast cancers . The comparison of pCR rates between the two racial cohorts will be perform ed as 
exploratory analysis.

Date : 05-Jun-[ADDRESS_1132108] chemotherapy sensitive tumors, pCR rates do not exceed 35 -
40 % with the most widely used third generation neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens that 
include a taxane (with or without a platinum agent) and anthracycline ( Rouzier et al, 2005 ). 
Pathologic complete response is associated with excellent long  term disease free and overall 
survival in this disease subset ( Liedtke et al, 2008 ). On the other hand, patients with TNBC and 
residual cancer after neoadjuvant therapy have poor prognosis with 3 -year recurrence rates 
around 50% (Symmans et al, 2007 ). The  US FDA has recently recognized this strong 
association between pCR and long term survival in TNBC and HER2 positive breast cancers 
and expressed interest in accepting this endpoint for accelerated drug approval  in these cancers 
(FDA guidance, 2012 ). In Se ptember 2013, Pertuzumab (Perjeta PPPTM
PPP) was approved for HER2 
positive breast cancer in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel as neoadjuvant therapy 
on the  basis of increased pCR rates (US FDA, 2013 ). The goal of this research is to estimate if 
inclusion of an immune checkpoint inhibitor could increase pCR rate above historical rates.  
1.2 MEDI -4736 Background  
Investigators should be familiar with the current MEDI4736  Investigator Broch ure (IB). 
MEDI4736 is being developed as a potential a nticancer therapy for patients with advanced 
solid tumors. MEDI4736 i s a human monoclonal antibody (M Ab) of the immunoglobulin G1 
kappa (IgG1κ) subclass that inhibits binding of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) (B7 
homolog 1 [B7 -H1], cluster of diffe rentiation [CD]274) to programmed cell death 1 (PD -1; 
CD279) and CD80 (B7 -1). MEDI4736 is composed of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical 
light chains, with an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. MEDI4736 contains 
a triple mutation in t he constant domain of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 heavy chain that 
reduces binding to complement protein C1q and the fragment crystallizable gamma (Fcγ) 
receptors involved in triggering effector function.

 1.2.1 Summary of non -clinical  experience  
The non -clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the MEDI4736  
Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).    
In general, treatment with MEDI4736 was not associated with any serious drug -related 
adverse effects in cynomolgus monkeys. Adverse findings in a non -GLP (good laboratory 
practice) pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and dose range -finding study, and in a 
separate GLP compliant 4 -week repeat -dose toxicity study were both consistent with antidrug 
antibody (ADA) -associated morbidity and mortality in cynomolgus monkeys. The death of a 
single animal in the PK/PD and dose range -finding study was consistent with an 
ADA -associated acute anaphylactic reaction. The spectrum of findings, especially the 
microscopic pathology, in a single anima l in the 4 -week repeat -dose study indicated ADA -
mediated pathologic effects including immune complexes in tissues identified by 
[CONTACT_9064]. The NOAEL ( No Observed Adverse Effect Level)  of MEDI4736, the 
highest dose level at which chronic exposure  to the substance shows no adverse effects, was 
100 mg/kg that corresponds to the highest dose tested in preclinical toxicity studies.  
The IB may be updated during the conduct of this trial; each update will be reviewed and 
submitted to the HIC. Any new dr ug-related human toxicity information, or preclinical 
toxicity that is relevant for humans, will be incorporated  into the informed consent form.  
1.2.2 Summary of clinical experience

 proportional manner over the dose range of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg and approached linearity at ≥ 3 
mg/kg, suggesting that the nonlinear PK of MEDI4736 is likely due to saturable target -
mediated clearance. Exposures following multiple doses (currently up to  a maximum of 26 
doses) demonstrated accumulation consistent with PK parameters estimated from the first 
dose.  
Suppression of free soluble PD -L1 (sPD -L1) was correlated with MEDI4736 PK 
concentrations. Following administration of MEDI4736 monotherapy, fre e sPD -L1 levels 
were below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) in the majority of subjects with available 
data (n = 38) at all time  points following IV doses ≥ 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W).   
Overall, a low incidence of ADA was observed. Of the 220 subjects who received MEDI4736 
monotherapy and for whom PK/ADA data were available, [ADDRESS_1132111] on PK/pharmacodynamics reported in [ADDRESS_1132112].  
Safety  
As of 14Jul2014 , no identified risks are clearly associated with the use of MEDI4736. 
Important potential risks based on the mechanism of action of MEDI4736 and its related 
molecules include immune -mediated reactions such as enterocolitis, dermatitis, 
hepatitis/hepatotox icity, endocrinopathy, pneumonitis, and neuropathy. Additional important 
potential risks include infusion -related reactions, hypersensitivity, serious allergic reactions, 
serious infections, and immune complex disease.  
The majority of the safety data are from the monotherapy study, CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108, 
specifically the 10 mg/kg Q2W cohort (N = 393). In this cohort, the most frequently reported 
(≥ 10% of subjects) adverse events (AEs; all grades, regardless of causality) were fatigue 
(29.8%), nausea (20.1%) , dyspnea (19.6%), decreased appetite (19.1%), constipation (14.0%), 
diarrhea and vomiting (12.5% each), cough (11.5%), pyrexia and back pain (10.4% each), and 
rash (10.2%).  In approximately half of the subjects, the highest AE severity was Grade 1 
(25.2% of subjects) or Grade 2 (22.9% of subjects). Most of these events were managed 
clinically without the need for dose modifications or delays. Grade 3 or higher AEs that 
occurred in > 1% of subjects were dyspnea (5.1%), increased gamma -glutamyltransferase 
(3.3%), fatigue, general physical health deterioration, increased aspartate aminotransferase, 
and back pain (2.3% each), anemia and dehydration (1.8% each), and abdominal pain, 
vomiting, sepsis, syncope, and hypotension (1.3% each). Treatment -related Grade 3  AEs in 2

 or more subjects were fatigue (4 subjects), increased gamma -glutamyltransferase (3 subjects), 
and vomiting, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and 
arthralgia (2 subjects each). There were 2 subjects with tre atment -related Grade 4 events 
(hypercalcemia, fatigue) and [ADDRESS_1132113] with a treatment -related Grade 5 event (angiopathy). In 
general, Grade [ADDRESS_1132114] toxicity

Serious adverse events  (SAEs) and other significant AEs occurred in fewer than one -third of 
subjects treated with MEDI4736 10 mg/kg Q2W in Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108. The 
most frequently reported SAEs (regardless of causality; > 5 subjects) were dyspnea (15 
subjects), general ph ysical health deterioration (9 subjects), pyrexia (8 subjects), back pain 
and abdominal pain (7 subjects each), and dehydration and pleural effusion (6 subjects each). 
One subject (with Stage IV lung cancer and a history of cardiac disease) died due to 
angiopathy considered by [CONTACT_280529]4736. Adverse events that 
resulted in permanent discontinuation of MEDI4736 in ≥ 2 subjects were dyspnea (7 subjects), 
general physical health deterioration (5 subjects), and death, increased transam inases, 
pulmonary embolism, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (2 subjects each).  
No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been reported in any of the dose -escalation cohorts of 
the monotherapy studies. Overall, the AE profile of MEDI4736 was consistent with the 
pharmacology of the target. No tumor types appeared to be associated with unique AEs.  
Efficacy  
As of 14Jul2014, partial efficacy data are available for 2 monotherapy studies (CD -ON-
MEDI4736 -1108 and D4190C00002) and 1 combination therapy study  of MEDI4736 plu s 
tremelimumab  (D4190C00006). Tumor assessments were based on Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines (Eisenhauer et al, 2009).  
Clinical activity has been observed across the 3 studies. In Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108, 
169 of 414 subjects treated with MEDI4736 (all dose levels) were evaluable for response 
analysis, which included subjects who had at least [ADDRESS_1132115] -baseline tumor assessment or experience d clinical 
progressive disease (PD) or death. Nineteen subjects (11.2%) had a best overall response of 
complete response (CR)/partial response (PR; confirmed and unconfirmed). The disease 
control rate (DCR; CR + PR + stable disease [SD] ≥ 12 weeks) was 32%  (54 of 169 subjects).

Drug Interactions  
There are no known clinically significant interactions of MEDI4736 with other medicinal 
products, but no formal drug -drug interaction studies have been conducted with MEDI4736.  
Pregnancy and Lactation  
Nonclinical assessment of the potential reproductive and developmental toxicity of MEDI4736 
has not been conducted.  It is not known whether MEDI4736 is excreted in breast milk.  
1.3 Research hypothesis  
Our hypotheses are  that MEDI4736 administered concomitantly with weekly nab -paclitaxel and 
dose-dense AC (ddAC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy will induce higher pathologic complete 
response (pCR) rate ( >55%) in triple negative breast cancer than historical pCR rates (30 -40%) 
observed with the same chemotherapy regimen chemotherapy alone . We also h ypothesize that 
MEDI4736 can be administered safely at full dose concomitant with nab -paclitaxel (100mg/m2) 
and ddAC (60 mg/m PPP2
PPP and 600 mg/m PPP2
PPP respectively)  
 
1.4 Rationale for conducting this study  
There are few molecular prognostic markers for survival and predictive markers for 
chemotherapy sensitivity for Stage I -III TNBC. High level of lymphocytic infiltration in the 
primary tumor (TIL) is the only consistent prognostic marker for better survival  in the absence 
of any systemic therapy and it also serves as a predictive marker for higher pCR to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in these cancers (Bianchini et al, 2010; Loi et al, 2013; Denkert et

 al, 2010). These observations raise the possibility that antit umor immune response may 
contribute to the better clinical outcome. Multiple different preclinical studies indicate that 
immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, particularly activated cytotoxic T cells, partially 
mediate chemotherapy response (Bracci e t al, 2014, Zitvogel et al, 2008). The CD80/CTLA4 
and PD1/PD -L1/L2 receptor -ligand interactions play a major role in suppressing cytotoxic T 
cell activity. In the lymph nodes, PD -L1 expressed on antigen -presenting cells binds to PD -1 
or CD80 on activated T  cells and inhibits their activity (Keir et al, 2008; Park et al, 2010). In 
the tumor microenvironment, PD -L1 is also expressed on tumor cells and can suppress anti -
tumor immunity (Zou et al, 2008).  Several studies using different immunohistochemistry 
methods and in situ mRNA measurements have demonstrated that PD -L1 is expressed by 
[CONTACT_817629] 20 -60% of TNBC (Schalper et al, 2014; Soliman et al, 
2014; Mittendorf et al, 2014; Ghebeh et al, 2008). The relationship between PD -L1 expr ession 
and response to MEDI4736 is currently unclear, objective tumor response in lung cancer and 
melanoma appear to be more common in PD -L1 positive cancers (defined as > 1% IHC 
positivity) but is also seen in PD -L1 negative cases (Antonio et al, ESMO [ADDRESS_1132119] 
7629). Currently, there is no agreed upon standard clinical test to determine PD -L1 
expression, and different research groups and companies often use different methods. For 
these reasons, this study will not restrict eligibility based on PD -L1 expression.  
In the past few years new drugs emerged that can boost local anti -tumor immune response by 
[CONTACT_817630]1 mediated immune checkpoints. Antibodies that target the interaction 
between PD1 and its ligands can enhance the cytotoxic activity of a ntitumor T cells by 
[CONTACT_817631] (Blank et al, 2006).  Multiple different drugs that block the 
PD1 ligand interaction has been shown to induce objective and lasting tumor responses in 
multiple different tumor types including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer and 
bladder cancer (Brahmer et al, 2012; Hamid et al, 2013; Herbst et al, 2013; Kirskwood et al, 
2010). PD1 -targeted drugs as single agent therapy in Phase I trials also showed objective 
responses in 15 -20% of metastatic TNBC  (San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, 2014, Abs 
#S1-09) . 
1.5 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
All patients who participate in this trial will receive the currently most effective sequential 
taxane and anthracycline combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy, wh ich is considered 
standard of care in this patient population. Long -term disease -free and overall survival are the 
same for patients who receive the same chemotherapy, regardless if the treatment is given 
preoperatively (neoadjuvant treatment) or postoprat ively (adjuvant therapy).  Administration 
of chemotherapy preoperatively provides an opportunity to directly assess the cytotoxicity of a 
treatment regime. It also yields personal benefits for patients in the form of tumor shrinkage 
that allows smaller res ection and providing important prognostic information that resides in 
the pathologic tumor stage. Patients with TNBC and extensive residual cancer after 
chemotherapy have very poor prognosis which could motivate patients to seek out further 
adjuvant clinic al trials to improve outcome. It is widely held that increasing the pCR rate in

regimens can accomplish, we hope that the magnitude of improvement will be sufficient to 
increase long -term survival which can be demonstrated in the future , in a much larger 
randomized trial.   
The risk inherent to this clinical  study  is increased toxicity due to inclusion of MEDI4736 in 
the treatment. MEDI4736 monotherapy at the 10 mg/kg dose administered every two weeks 
was well tolerated. No dose limiting toxicities were reached in any of the dose escalation 
trials. However, the most frequent adverse events , including fatigue, dyspnea, decreased 
appetite and liver enzyme elevations , are also adverse events that can be caused by [CONTACT_817632]. Safety monitoring and dose reduction guidelines are 
built into the trial to minimize harm.  
Currently there are no known clinically significant drug interactions with MEDI4736 and 
other drugs . Humanized monoclonal antibodies, as a dru g class, have also not demonstrated 
significant interactions with chemotherapy drugs.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary objective (s) 
 
The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the trial is to assess the safety of MEDI4736 
combined with chemotherapy and determ ine if full dose of MEDI4736 can be administered in 
combination with  weekly nab -paclitaxel x [ADDRESS_1132121] tissue and lymph nodes  (ypT0/Tis, N0), after  
neoadjuvant (pre -operative) therapy with MEDI4736 in combination with weekly nab -
paclitaxel x 12 treatments followed by [CONTACT_46054]4736 in combination with ddAC  x 4 treatments 
for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 negative (triple negative, 
TNBC), clinical stage I -III breast cancer.  
 
2.2 Secondary objective (s) 
To assess the toxicity of adding anti -PD-L1 antibody, MEDI4736 to neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
with standard of care nab -paclitaxel and dd AC. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_817633], Version 4.0. and will also moni tor for

≥3 colitis, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, rash and anti -drug-
antibody (ADA) immune complex disease ( manifested as symptoms of arthralgi a, serum -
sickness, abdominal pain, back pain, and vasculitis). Acute toxicities  will be reported for the 
entire 20-week duration of therapy for patients included in the Phase II portion of the trial and 
also separately for the combination with nab-paclitaxel and dose dense AC respectively . Late 
toxicities will also be collected and reported separately for 90 days after completion of treatment.  
 
2.3 Exploratory objective (s) 
Exploratory correlative science objectives include correlation of baseline an d post -treatment 
residual cancer immune parameters of the tumor with pCR.  
The following immune parameters, in order of priority in case of limited tissue availability, will 
be assessed using quantitative immunohistochemistry in base line core needle biops ies: PD1 
(programmed death receptor 1) and PD -L1 and -L2 (programmed death receptor ligands 1 and 
2), CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD137, FOXP3, OX40, CTLA4 and GITR. Tumor infiltrating 
lymphocyte (TIL) count will be estimated from an H&E section and quantified as th e percent of 
stromal cells that are lymphocytes.  
RNA expression profiling will also be performed on all base line core needle biopsy 
samples using RNA sequencing to assess associations between pCR and published immune gene 
signatures. The [ADDRESS_1132123] cell types including plasma cells (IGG metagene), T -cells (CD8A metagene) 
and antigen -presenting cells (MHC2 metagene) and also capture important immune regulatory 
pathways such as MHC1 gene expression (MHC1 metaene), STAT1 co -expressed genes  
(STAT1 metagene), interferon -inducible genes (IF -I metagene)  and ch emokine signaling 
through CXCL9  and CXCL 1. These metagenes were selected because they were repeatedly 
observed in gene expression data, can be assessed reliably and carry prognostic value.  
Whole exome DNA sequencing will also performed to identify somatic mutations and 
other alteration s that could be potential novel predictive markers of response. These will 
represent exploratory analysis. Sequencing will be performed at the Yale Center for Genome 
analysis with average depths of UUU> UUU150x. 
Blood will be collected at baseline before s tarting therapy and after completion of all 
neoadjuvant treatment for future studies.

 5.1.2 Doses and treatment regimens  
MEDI4736 will be administered every 2 weeks at doses of either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg during 
the phase I portion of this study.  The dose of MEDI4736 in the phase II portion will be either 
3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, as determined in t he phase I portion.  
There will be no intra -patient dose escalation permitted.

achieve the accurate dose according to Appendix A.  
Preparation of inf usion bags  
The preparation of infusion bags should be done under aseptic conditions by [CONTACT_31809]; it should not be prepared on the ward.  
An additional volume of 0.9% (w/v) saline equal to the calculated volume of MEDI4736 to be 
added to the IV bag must be removed from the bag prior to addition of MEDI4736.  
The calculated volume of MEDI4736 is then added to the IV bag, and the bag is mixed by 
[CONTACT_471385].  
Prior to the start of the infusion, ensure th at the bag contents are at room temperature to avoid 
an infusion reaction due to the administration of the solution at low temperatures.  
Vials should be used for specific subjects and should not be shared between subjects . 
5.1.4 Dose administration  
MEDI4736 will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C ) by [CONTACT_62655] a peripheral vein.   
Following preparation of MEDI4736, the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered 
as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2 -μm in -line filter.  
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of normal saline equal to the priming volume of the 
infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete the

 infusion according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and document 
if the line was not flushed.  
Since the compatibility of MEDI4736 with other IV medications and solutions, other than 
normal saline (0.9% [weight/volume] sodium  chloride for injection), is not known, the 
MEDI4736 solution should not be infused through an IV line in which other solutions or 
medications are being administered.  
5.1.5 Monitoring of dose administration  
Subjects will be monitored during and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs at the 
times specified in the Sched ule of Assessment (see Section 8 .2).  
In the event of a ≤Grade  2 infusion -related reaction, the infusion rate of study drug may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution o f the event (up to 4 hours) and re -initiated at 
50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion.   For subjects with a ≤Grade 2 
infusion -related reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial 
rate.  Acetaminophen and/or an  antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) or equivalent 
medications per institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator.   If the infusion -related reaction is ≥Grade [ADDRESS_1132144] [ZIP_CODE].

5.3 Doxorubicin co mbined with Cyclophosphamide ( AC) 
Doxorubicin is an antineoplastic antibiotic. It has multiple mechanisms of action including 
inhibition of topoisomerase II, generation of free oxygen  radicals and induction of apoptosis.  
Cyclophosphamide is a synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically relat ed to nitrogen mustard.  
Cyclophosphamide is metabolized in the liver to active alkylating compounds by [CONTACT_817638]. These metabolites induce DNA cross links which lead to cell 
death.  
Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are used in combinati on due to synergistic anticancer 
activity and have been shown to improve survival of early stage breast cancer in randomized 
clinical trials.   
5.3.1 Formulation/packaging/storage  
Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Injection: Vials contain 10 mg/5 mL, 20 mg/10 mL, 50 mg/2 5 
mL, 150 mg/75 mL, and 200 mg/100 mL Doxorubicin hydroch loride as a clear red solution. 
Lyophilized Doxorubicin Hydrochloride for Injection: Vials contain 10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg, 
and 150 mg Doxorubicin hydrochloride as a red -orange lyophilized powder.  
Cyclop hosphamide is supplied in 500 mg, 1 000mg and 2000mg vials  (as anhydrous 
cyclophosphamide).

 6.2 Dosage and Administration  
MEDI4736 will be administered at two dose levels of either UUU3 mg/kg UUU ([ADDRESS_1132149]
PPP dose level) or UUU10 
mg/kg UUU (2 PPPnd
PPP dose level) over 60 minute IV infusion every 2 weeks  during the Phase I portion of 
the trial to establish the RP2D which will be used in the Phase I I portion of the trial.   
MEDI4736 will be administered immediately after administration of Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m PPP2
PPP  
IV on Day 1 of chemotherapy on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (every two weeks). Nab -paclitaxel will 
be administered on day  1 weekly x 12 treatments.   
After completion of the 12 courses of nab -paclitaxel / MEDI3476, d oxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide (AC) will be administered at 60 mg/m PPP2
PPP and 600 mg/m PPP2
PPP dose respectively, 
once every two weeks x 4 treatments as described in section 5.2. Pegfilgrastim 6 mg will be 
given as IM injection 24 hours (Day 2) after each AC chemotherapy. MEDI4736 is administered 
at the R2PD (or assigned dose cohort in the phase I p ortion) on Day 2 immediately after the 
administration of pegfilgrastim  during each course of AC (weeks 13,15,17 and 19) .  
6.3 Dose Escalation Decision Rules  
Phase I safety portion of the trial  
Two dose levels will be assessed including 3mg/kg and 10mg/kg MEDI4736 in combination with 
weekly nab -paclitaxel x 12 treatments followed by [CONTACT_46054]4736 in combination with ddAC x 4 
treatments.  
UUU3 mg/kg MEDI4736 dose level  
The first 3 patients will be enro lled at dose level of 3 mg/kg MEDI4736 concomitant with 
chemotherapy. Further accrual will be halted after the first 3 patients are enrolled until the DLT 
assessment is complete  for a given treatment part of the two -part (weekly nab -paclitaxel x 12 + AC x 
4) chemotherapy regimen . If no patients experience a DLT during the weekly nab -paclitaxel treatment 
period ( 12 weeks), the next 3 patients will start weekly nab -paclitaxel at the next dose level, 10 mg/kg , 
while the previous cohort is still receiving AC ch emotherapy (with MEDI4736 at 3 mg/kg).  If 1 
patient experiences DLT  during either the nab -paclitaxel or AC parts of the therapy , 3 additional 
patients will be enrolled at the 3 mg/kg dose -level  in combination with the chemotherapy part of 
interest . If non e of these 3 additional patients experience DLT (i.e. the final observed DLT rate is 1 of 
6), the dose is escalated to 10 mg/kg  for the given chemotherapy part . If [ADDRESS_1132150] 6 patients treated at the 3 mg/kg dose lev el, the study will be halted and dose de -
escalation will be considered as an amendment to the trial after consultation with the sponsor. If [ADDRESS_1132151] 3 patients treated at 3 mg/kg dose level, the study will 
also be h alted and dose de -escalation will be considered as an amendment to the trial.

 Using the above design, the probabilities of halting dose escalation , in each treatment part, for true 
rates of DLT ranging from 5% to 70% are as follows:  
True rate of DLT:    5%   10%    20%    30%   40%   50%   60%   70%

UUU10 mg/kg MEDI4736 dose level  
If dose escalation is feasible, the next cohort of patients will receive MEDI4736  at 10 mg/kg dose 
concomitant with chemotherapy. Accrual will be halted after the first 3 patients are enrolled at the 10 
mg/kg dose until DLT assessment is complete for nab -paclitaxel (i.e. all [ADDRESS_1132152] completed 12 
weeks of nab -paclitaxel chemothe rapy). If only [ADDRESS_1132153] 3 patients are 
treated at this dose level, the study will proceed to enroll 3 additional patients at the 10 mg/kg dose 
level  in combination with nab -paclitaxel . If none or only 1 of these additional 3 patients show DLT 
(final observed DLT 1 of 6), this dose level will be moved forward to the Phase II portion for efficacy 
assessment  and accrual will start on the nab -paclitaxel part of treatment while patients are completing 
the AC part of their therapy . If [ADDRESS_1132154] 6 patients treated at 
the 10 mg/kg dose level, the dose will be de -escalated to 3 mg/kg and this dose is designated as the 
RP2D for the subsequent Phase II portion of the trial. If [ADDRESS_1132155] 3 experience 
DLT, the dose will be de -escalated to 3 mg/kg dose and this dose will be moved forward to the Phase 
II portion for efficacy assessment. DLT will be assessed similarly and the same expansion rules will be 
followed during the AC part of the treatment.  
Phase II portion of the trial  
The interim efficacy and toxicity analysis will be performed after the first [ADDRESS_1132156] 12 weeks of MEDI4736 at the 
recommended p hase 2 dose concomitant with chemotherapy.  Patien ts who received lower than the 
RP2D  during the Phase I portion of the trial will not be included in the efficacy analysis. Patients who 
discontinued MEDI4736 within 12 weeks of initiation of therapy for any reason are also not eligible 
for efficacy analysi s, but will be included in the toxicity assessment . Trial accrual will continue while 
efficacy and toxicity data is accumulating for the 22 patients.  
The trial will terminate for lack of efficacy if < [ADDRESS_1132157] 22 experience pCR (Alpha = 
beta = 10%, probability of early termination if the response rate is 30%=0.67). If > 7 patients 
experience pCR, accrual will continue until a maximum of 50 patients are accrued.  
Safety analysis: If > 2/22 patients experience DLT or a serious treatment rela ted adverse event (SAE)  
during the full 20 week treatment period , the MEDI4736 dose schedule will be re - evaluated. If futility 
criteria is not met (i.e. >7/[ADDRESS_1132158] pCR), the trial will continue after the MEDI4736 dose and 
schedule is amended to i mprove safety. With [ADDRESS_1132159] stage, there is > 90% chance of 
observing at least 1 DLT event, if the true underlying rate of the adverse event is > 10%.

6.4 Definition of DLT  
Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) to establish RP2D will be evaluated during the entire 20 weeks 
of therapy. Any DLT encountered during the 20 week treatment period will be considered DLT. 
Grading of toxicities will be according to NCI CTCAE v 5.0 
(https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_5.0/ T5 9T59T). The following toxicities will be considered 
DLT that require permanent discontinuation of MEDI4736:  
• Any Grade 4 immune -mediated  adverse event ( imAE) defined as adverse events (AEs) 
of immune nature (ie, inflammatory) in the absence of a clear alternative etiology. In 
the absence of clinical abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will need to be performed 
to confi rm a significant laboratory finding prior to designating it as a DLT.  
• Any > Grade 3 colitis  irrespective of duration  
• Any Grade 3 or 4 noninfectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration  
• Any Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 days 
of the initiation of maximal supportive care . 
• Any Grade 3 i mAE, (except colitis or pneumonitis , see above) , that does not resolve to 
Grade 2 within 3 days after onset of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_817594] l medical management 
including systemic corticosteroids or does not downgrade to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline 
within 14 days . 
• Any ≥ Grade 3 non -imAE deemed by [CONTACT_817639]473 6 except those listed below  which are NOT considered dose 
limiting:  
o Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days  
o Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and/or adrenal insufficiency) 
that is managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or 
hormone replacement therapy and t he subject is asymptomatic  
o Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (eg, 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc)  
o Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade

6.5 Dose Modification  and Toxicity Management  
6.5.1 MEDI4736  
For adverse events (AEs) that are considered at least partly due to administration of 
MEDI4736 the following dose adjustment guidance may be applied:  
• Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding the 
agent suspected of causing the toxicity where required).  
• If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be given 
to continuing the same dose of MEDI4736 along with appropriate continuing 
supportive care.  If medically appropriate,  dose modifications are permitted for 
MEDI4736 (see below).  
• All dose modifications should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation 
of the approach taken.  
 
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which MEDI4736 should be permanently 
discontinued.  
 
Following the first dose of MEDI4736, subsequent administration of MEDI4736 can be 
modified based on toxicities observed (see Table 1, 2, and 3 below).

 Based on the mechanism of action of MEDI4736 leading to T -cell a ctivation and proliferation, 
there is the possibility of observing immune mediated Adverse Events (i mAEs) during the 
conduct of this study.  Potential i mAEs include immune -mediated enterocolitis, dermatitis, 
hepatitis, and endocrinopathies. Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
imAEs.  In the absence of an alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD) signs or symptoms of 
enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy should be considered to be immune -
related.   
Dose modification recommendations and toxicity management guidelines for immune -
mediated reactions, for infusion -related reactions, and for non -immune -mediated reactions are 
detailed in Table s 1, 2, and 3, respectively.   
In addition, management guidelines for adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are detailed

Pediatric Considerations  
Dose Modifications  Toxicity Management

CTC grade/severity is the same for pediatric patients as it is for adult patients, as 
well as to permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen if unable to reduce 
corticoste roid ≤  a dose equivalent to that required for corticosteroid replacement 
therapy within 12  weeks of the start of the immune -mediated event  (imAE)  − All recommendations for specialist consultation should occur with a pediatric specialist in the specialty 
recommended.  
− The recommendations for dosing of steroids (i.e., mg/kg/day) and for IV IG and plasmapheresis that are 
provided for adult patients should also be used for pediatric patients.  
− The infliximab 5 mg/kg IV dose recommended for adults is the same as recommended for pediatric 
patients ≥ [ADDRESS_1132163].  
− For pediatric dosing of mycophenolate mofetil, consult with a pediatric s pecialist.  
− With long -term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, consider need for PJP prophylaxis, 
gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.

Peripheral 
neuromotor 
syndromes   
(such as Guillain -
Barre and 
Myasthenia Gravis ) Any Grade  General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
- The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes is 
important, since certain patients may unpredictably experience acute 
decompensations which can result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, 
death. Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms which may 
predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_159814], and signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_817599]  
- Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease 
progression, infections, metabolic syndromes and medications, etc.). It should be 
noted that the diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor  syndromes 
can be particularly challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the 
multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout 
the neuraxis. Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is 
essential to have a low threshold to obtain a neurological consult  
- Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (e.g., electromyogram and nerve conduction 
investigations, and  “repetitive stimulation” if myasthenia is suspected) are 
routinely indicated upon suspi[INVESTIGATOR_817600] a neurology consultation  
It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary treatment of 
Guillain -Barre is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_27574]. Patients requiring treatment

MYASTHENIA GRAVIS  
o Steroids may be successfully used to treat Myasthenia Gravis. Important 
to consider that steroid therapy (especially with high doses) may result in 
transient worsening of myasthenia and should typi[INVESTIGATOR_453710] a monitored setting under supervis ion of a consulting neurologist.  
o Patients unable to tolerate steroids may be candidates for treatment with 
plasmapheresis or IVIG. Such decisions are best made in consultation 
with a neurologist, taking into account the unique needs of each patient.  
o If Mya sthenia Gravis -like neurotoxicity present, consider starting 
acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitor therapy in addition to steroids. 
Such therapy, if successful, can also serve to reinforce the diagnosis.

8.2 Description of study procedures  
8.2.1 Medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, weight and vital signs  
Findings from medical history (obtained at screening) and physical examination shall be given a baseline grade 
according to the procedure for AEs. Increases in severity of pre -existing conditions during the study will be 
considered AEs, with resolution occurring when the grade returns to the pre -study grade or below.  
Physical examinations will be performed on study days noted in the Schedule of Assessments . 
A complete physical examination will be performed and will include an assessment of the following (as 
clinically indicated): general appearance,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, head and neck (including 
ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculo -skeletal (including spi[INVESTIGATOR_98243]), 
genital/rectal, and neurological systems and at screening only, height.   
ECGs are  required during screening, within 14 days prior to starting study treatment  and will be repeated on 
week 6 (+/ - 1 week) during the Nab -paclitaxel therapy and on week 17  (+/- 1 week ) during the AC part of the 
chemotherapy , and may be repeated any time if clinically indicated . ECGs recorded during the screening period 
will be obtained in triplicate (all [ADDRESS_1132183] 1 minute apart) ; ECGs recorded during 
the treatment phase will be single tracing . All [ADDRESS_1132184] 5 minutes in each case.

The primary efficacy endpoint is pathologic complete response (pCR). P athologic response will be assessed in 
the surgically resected cancer and lymph nodes after completion of all chemotherapy by [CONTACT_817648]. Pathologic complete response is defined as no invasive cancer in the resected breas t tissue 
and lymph nodes  (ypT0/Tis, ypN0) . This information will be extracted from the pathology report and patients 
will be assigned to one of two response categories, pCR or residual disease (RD) for the purpose of efficacy 
analysis.

10.1.1  Safety Parameters  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of adverse events  
The International Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) Guideline for Good  Clinical Practice (GCP) E6(R1) 
defines an AE as:  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product.  
An AE includes but is no t limited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s pre -existing condition. 
An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG finding) that requires an action or intervention by [CONTACT_1275], or a finding judged by [CONTACT_817649] t a change beyond the range of normal 
physiologic fluctuation, should be reported as an AE.

 Adverse events may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after initial receipt of investigational product) or 
nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment -emergent AE is any new sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward 
medical event that begins after written in formed consent has been obtained but before the subject has received 
investigational product.  
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to the subject being 
enrolled into the study) for a documented pre -existing condition, that did not worsen from baseline, is not 
considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical event occurring during the prescheduled 
elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment should be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
The ter m AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs.  
10.1.2  Definition  of serious adverse event s 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i .e., screening, run-in, treatment, wash -out, 
follow -up), at any dose of the study drugs that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:  
Results in death  
Is immediately life -threatening  
Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_817613] a congenital abnormality or birth defect  in offspring of the subject  
Is an important medical event that may jeopardi ze the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above.  
• Medical or scientific  judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed by [CONTACT_1275](s) and communicated to [COMPANY_008].

An adverse event  of special interest (AESI ) is an event  of scientific and medical interest specific to the further 
understanding of the MEDI4736 safety profile and require close monitoring and r apid communication by [CONTACT_27719]. MEDI4736 AESIs may be serious or non -serious. The rapid reporting of these 
AESIs allows ongoing analysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with 
the use of this  investigational product.  
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an event being an imAE, the Investigator should promptly

inhibitors” that amplify antitumor immune responses by [CONTACT_817650] -inhibitory or co -stimulatory receptors , CTLA -4 and PD -1, expressed on T cells (Callahan and Wolchok, 
2013). This class of drugs can have a wide spectrum of immune -mediated reactions that have been considered 
inflammatory in nature and can affect any organs of the body.  
AESIs observed with durvalumab include:  
• Diarrhea / Colitis and intestinal perforation  
• Pneumonitis / ILD  
• hepatitis / transaminase increases  
• Endocrinopathies (i.e. events of hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], adrenal insufficiency, hyper - and

 • Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (e.g. Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis)  
• Intestinal Perforations  
Other inflammatory responses that are rare/less frequent with a potential immune -mediated etiology include, but 
are not limited to:  
• Peric arditis  
• Sarcoidosis  
• Uveitis  
• Other events involving the eye and skin  
• Hematological events  
• Rheumatological events  
• Vasculitis  
• Non-infectious meningitis  
• Non-infectious encephalitis.  
It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune med iated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs.  
In addition, infusion -related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions with a different underlying 
pharmacological aetiology are also considered AESIs.  
Further information on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms) can be found in the current version of the 
durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure. More specific guidelines for their evaluation and treatment are described 
in detail in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines (please se e Appendix 1). These

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Pneumonitis  
Immune -mediated pneumonitis is characterized by [CONTACT_817651] -target effects of checkpoint inhibitors against the normal lung 
parenchyma. (Chow, 2013) Presentations of pneumonitis range from asymptomatic lung infiltrates to a mimic 
of severe bacterial pneumonia. For symptomat ic patients, complaints and findings may include dyspnea, cough, 
tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hypoxia.  
The frequency of immune -mediated pneumonitis in clinical trials with immune checkpoint -inhibitors ranged 
from ≤1% to 4%. (Topalian et al, 2012; B rahmer et al, 2012)  
Because pneumonitis can quickly escalate and become fatal, early recognition is essential. Initial workup 
includes chest imaging; however, pneumonitis can have highly variable appearances on chest CT scans.  In 
patients with pulmonary metastases or cardiopulmonary comorbidities, evaluation can be particularly 
challenging as it can be difficult to differentiate between infection, early pulmonary edema, alveolar 
hemorrhage, immune -mediated pneumonitis, immune -related tumor inflammation, a nd tumor progression 
(Topalian et al, 2012). Pneumonitis has also been reported as a complication of cancer treatment associated with 
lung and breast cancer.  
Guidelines for the management of subjects with immune -mediated events including pneumonitis are ou tlined in 
Section 6.6.1.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as infusion -related reactions have been reported with anti -PD-L1 and anti -
PD-1 therapy (Topalian et al, 2012; Brahmer et al, 2012 ). As wi th the administration of any foreign protein 
and/or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of MAbs can be caused by [CONTACT_62535], 
including acute anaphylactic (immunoglobulin E -mediated) and anaphylactoid reactions against the MAb, a nd 
serum sickness. Acute allergic reactions may occur, may be severe, and may result in death. Acute allergic 
reactions may include hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, 
hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, w heeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypertension, myalgia, 
vomiting and unresponsiveness.  
Guidelines for management of subjects with hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) and 
infusion -related reactions are outlined in Sectio n 6.6.1 .

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatic function abnormalities (hepatotoxicity)  
Increased transaminases have been reported during treatment with anti -PD-L1/anti -PD-1 antibodies (Brahmer et 
al 2012).  Inflammatory hepatitis has been reported in 3% to 9% of subjects treated with anti -CTLA -4 
monoclonal antibodies (e.g., ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  The clinical manifestations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated subjects included 
general weakness, fatigue, nausea and/or mild fever and increased liver function tests such as AST, ALT, 
alkaline phosphatase, and/or total bilir ubin.  
Hepatic function abnormality is defined as any increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3  × ULN and concurrent  
increase in total bilirubin to be greater than 2 × ULN. Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single 
blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other. Follow -up investigations and 
inquiries will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_817652]/or whether there is objective evidence that clearly  supports causation by a disease (e.g., cholelithiasis and 
bile duct obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational product. Guidelines 
for management of subjects with hepatic function abnormality are outlined in Section  6.6.1.  
Cases where a subject shows an AST or ALT ≥3xULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to be reported as 
SAEs, These cases should be reported as SAEs if, after evaluation they meet the criteria for a Hy’s Law case or 
if any of the individual liver te st parameters fulfill any of the SAE criteria.

10.2.1  Assessment of severity  
There is a distinction between serious and severe AEs.  Assessment of seriousness will be made solely by [CONTACT_817653].  Therefore, serious events will not be automatically considered severe.  For example, 
a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild (not severe) stroke, but it would 
still meet serious criteria and thus, be captured as an SAE.  Similarly, severe events may not always be serious.  
An example would be an epi[INVESTIGATOR_528846], transient  nausea which persists for several hours.  This would be 
classified as a “severe” epi[INVESTIGATOR_812537], but if it did not require treatment, intervention, or somehow meet other 
serious criteria, it would not be considered an SAE.  
Severity of AEs will be grade d according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 5.0.  If 
a certain event or symptom is not described in the CTCAE grades, use the following grading scale:  
Grade 1 (mild)   An event that is usually transient and may require only min imal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living.  
 
Grade 2 (moderate)  An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.

 Grade 3 (severe)  An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event interrupts 
usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the 
subject.  
 
Grade 4 (life threatening)  Any adverse drug experience that places the patient or patient, in the view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e. it 
does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
 
Grade 5 (fatal)   Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.  
 
 
Unexpected AE  Any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent 
with the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is not required 
or available, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan.  “ Unexpected” as used in 
this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously 
observed (e.g., included in the investigator brochure) rather than from the 
perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacologi cal 
properties of the pharmaceutical product.  
10.2.2  Assessment of relationship  
Determination of causality between an adverse event and drug therapy will be made after consideration of all 
clinically relevant data prior to, during, and after occurrence of the eve nt. Clinically relevant data include, but are 
not limited to; underlying disease, past and present medical history (all concurrent non -malignant disease), 
concurrent medications, and timing between event and drug administration. The mechanism of action and  prior 
toxicology of the study drug should be considered. An adverse event is associated with the use of the drug when 
there is a reasonable possibility that the drug may have caused the event.  
The following attribution guidelines are recommended by [CONTACT_941] U S National Cancer institute:  
        Unrelated:  The Adverse Event is clearly not related to the investigational agent (s)  
        Unlikely:     The Adverse Event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s)

 10.3.1  Study recording period and follow -up for adverse events  and serious adverse events  
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded  from time of signature [CONTACT_43998], 
throughout the  treatment period and including the follow -up period ( including a minimum of [ADDRESS_1132199] dose of MEDI4736 ). 
During the course of the study all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each  subject . Every 
effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events  continue after 
discontinuation/study completion.  
If a subject disco ntinues from treatment for reasons other than disease progression, and therefore continues to 
have tumor assessments, drug or procedure -related SAEs must be captured until the patient is considered to 
have confirmed PD and will have no further tumor assess ments.  
The investigator is responsible for following all SAEs until resolution, until the subject  returns to baseline 
status, or until the condition has stabilized with the expectation that it will  remain chronic, even if this extends 
beyond study participation.  
Follow -up of unresolved adverse events  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last visit in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_817654], but w ithout further recording .  After [ADDRESS_1132200] -related SAEs will con tinue to be followed for safety.  
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
Post study events  
 
After the subject has been permanently withdrawn from the study, there is no obligation for  the investigator to 
actively report information on new AE or SAEs occurring in former study  subjects after the [ADDRESS_1132201] has been permanently withdrawn from study, and he/she considers 
there is a reasonab le possibility that the event is related to study treatment, the investigator should notify the 
study sponsor and [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Drug Safety.

MTD /RP2D  determination  
In the Phase I safety po rtion of the trial 2  dose levels will be assessed including 3mg/kg and 10mg/kg 
concomitant with weekly Nab -paclitaxel and concomitantly with dose dense doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide.  Intra -patient dose escalation is not allowed.  Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed o ver 
the entire 20 weeks of therapy with MEDI4736 to determine MTD/RP2D  but will be monitored separately 
during the two parts of the chemotherapy regimen (nab -paclitaxel x 12 weeks and AC x 4 treatments every two -
weeks) . Delayed toxicities (i.e. toxicity in  the 90 day follow -up period after completion of neoadjuvant therapy) 
are not considered for DLT purposes . 
Analysis of safety endpoint  
Interim sa fety analysis  of the Phase II portion of the trial will be performed when [ADDRESS_1132218] one treatment with MEDI4736.  If > 2/22 patients experience DLT or a serious treatment related 
adverse event (SAE), the MEDI4736 dose schedule will be re -evaluated. If futility criteria is not met  at the 
interim efficacy analysis , the trial will c ontinue after the MEDI4736 dose and schedule is amended to improve 
safety.  With [ADDRESS_1132219] stage, there is > 90% chance of observing at least 1 DLT event, if the true 
underlying rate of the adverse event is > 10%.  
Final toxicity results will be reported as frequency statistics with 95% confidence intervals.  All patients who 
received at last one dose of MEDI4736 at the RP2D will be included in the final toxicity analysis.  Acute 
toxicit ies that occur during the treatment phase  will be reported separately from late toxicities that are 
encountered during the 90 -day follow up period after completion of all neoadjuvant therapy.  Acute t oxicities will 
also be reported separately for the combination with nab -paclitaxel and dose dense AC.  
Phase I safety portion of the trial  
Two dose levels will be assessed including 3mg/kg and 10mg/kg MEDI4736 in combination with weekly nab -
paclitaxel x 12 treatments followed by [CONTACT_46054]4736 in combination with ddAC x 4 treatments.

 UUU3 mg/kg MEDI4736 dose leve l 
The first 3 patients will be enrolled at dose level of 3 mg/kg MEDI4736 concomitant with chemotherapy. Further 
accrual will be halted after the first 3 patients are enrolled until the DLT assessment is complete for a given 
treatment part of the two -part (w eekly nab -paclitaxel x 12 + AC x 4) chemotherapy regimen. If no patients 
experience a DLT during the weekly nab -paclitaxel treatment period (12 weeks), the next 3 patients will start 
weekly nab -paclitaxel at the next dose level, 10 mg/kg, while the previou s cohort is still receiving AC 
chemotherapy (with MEDI4736 at 3 mg/kg).  If 1 patient experiences DLT during either the nab -paclitaxel or 
AC parts of the therapy, 3 additional patients will be enrolled at the 3 mg/kg dose -level in combination with the 
chem otherapy part of interest. If none of these 3 additional patients experience DLT (i.e. the final observed DLT 
rate is 1 of 6), the dose is escalated to 10 mg/kg for the given chemotherapy part. If [ADDRESS_1132220] 6 patient s treated at the 3 mg/kg dose level, the study will be halted and dose de -
escalation will be considered as an amendment to the trial after consultation with the sponsor. If [ADDRESS_1132221] 3 patients treated at 3 mg/kg dos e level, the study will also be halted 
and dose de -escalation will be considered as an amendment to the trial.  
Using the above design, the probabilities of halting dose escalation, in each treatment part, for true rates of DLT 
ranging from 5% to 70% are as follows:  
True rate of DLT:    5%   10%    20%    30%   40%   50%   60%   70%

UUU10 mg/kg MEDI4736 dose level  
If dose escalation is feasible, the next co hort of patients will receive MEDI4736 at 10 mg/kg dose concomitant 
with chemotherapy. Accrual will be halted after the first 3 patients are enrolled at the 10 mg/kg dose until DLT 
assessment is complete for nab -paclitaxel (i.e. all [ADDRESS_1132222] complet ed 12 weeks of nab -paclitaxel 
chemotherapy). If only [ADDRESS_1132223] 3 patients are treated at this dose level, the 
study will proceed to enroll 3 additional patients at the 10 mg/kg dose level in combination with nab -paclitaxel.  
If none or only 1 of these additional 3 patients show DLT (final observed DLT 1 of 6), this dose level will be 
moved forward to the Phase II portion for efficacy assessment and accrual will start on the nab -paclitaxel part of 
treatment while patients are completing the AC part of their therapy. If [ADDRESS_1132224] 6 patients treated at the 10 mg/kg dose level, the dose will be de -escalated to 3 mg/kg and this 
dose is designated as the RP2D for the subsequent Phase II portio n of the trial. If [ADDRESS_1132225] 3 experience DLT, the dose will be de -escalated to 3 mg/kg dose and this dose will be moved forward to the 
Phase II portion for efficacy assessment. DLT will be assessed similarly and the same expansio n rules will be 
followed during the AC part of the treatment.

11.3 Determination of sample size  
The sample size is dictated by [CONTACT_941] 3+[ADDRESS_1132232] for follow up or withdraw from the study for any reasons other than toxicity or disease progression. We 
also assume that a few accrued patients will not be eligible for the prim ary efficacy  analysis due to receiving 
fewer than 6 courses of MEDI4736 due to toxicity (all such patients will be included in the safety analyses and 
secondary efficacy analysis).  To allow for replacement and to accrue the required number of eligible pat ients 
for primary efficacy analysis, we incre ase the sample size by 10% to a  total sample size 24 (with early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_817621]) or 55 patients  (with full accrual) to be included in the Phase II portion of the study .  
The combined sample size i ncluding both the Phase I and Phase II portions of the trial can range from a 
minimum of 24 (6 in Phase I plus 18 in Phase II) to a maximum 61 patients (6 in Phase I and 55 in Phase II).  
African American extension cohort  
We will perform one additional effi cacy analysis which includes assessing pCR rates in African America (AA) 
and non -AA patients separately in the Phase II portion of the trial. In order to make this exploratory analysis, 
we need at least N=20 AA patients accrued to the study. An AA only ext ension cohort will remain open until

 APPENDIX A : MEDI4736 DOSE CALCULATIONS  
MEDI4736 Dosing  
The MEDI4736 dosing should be done depending on subject weight:  
1. Cohort dose: X mg/kg  
2. Subject weight: Y kg  
3. Dose for subject: XY mg = X (mg/kg) × Y (kg)  
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  
Dose (mL) = XY mg / 50 (mg/mL) where 50 mg/mL is MEDI4736 nominal concentration  
The corresponding volume of MEDI4736 should be rounded to the near est tenth mL (0.1 mL). Dose 
adjustments for each cycle only needed for greater than 10% change in weight.  
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation is the next greatest whole number of vials from 
the following formula:  
Number of vial s = Dose (mL) / 10 (mL/vial)  
Example:  
1. Cohort dose: 10 mg/kg  
2. Subject weight: [ADDRESS_1132249]: 800 mg = 10 (mg/kg) × 80 (kg)  
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  
Dose (mL) = 800 mg / 50 (mg/mL) = 16.0 mL  
5. The theoretical number of vials  required for dose preparation:  
Number of vials = 16 .0 (mL) / 10 (mL/vial) = 2 vial

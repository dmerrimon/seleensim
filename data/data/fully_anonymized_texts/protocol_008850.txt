Background and Rationale:
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common kidney  cancer and constitutes about 3% of 
all malignant tumors in adults.1  Until 2005, interferon -alpha (IFN -) and high -dose 
interleukin (IL) -[ADDRESS_762627] of care for patients with advanced RCC 
(aRCC), albeit with modest efficacy .  Since then, development and approval of multiple 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamy cin (mTOR) 
inhibitors have significantly  improved the outcomes of aRCC
patients. These agents include 
the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) ty rosine kinase inhibitors (TKI s) sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib 
and sorafenib; the mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus, and the anti -VEGF 
monoclonal antibody  bevacizumab. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_580011], durable and complete response in aRCC patents are uncommon; 
the majority  of patients will eventually  develop resistance exhibit disease progression while 
on therap y and succumb to death du e to metastatic disease.
There is a strong rationale for considering immunotherapy in aRCC patients.  Cy tokine -based 
immunotherapy , especially  high -dose IL-2, exhibited durable responses in some aRCC 
patients. There are anecdotal reports of spontaneous remissions in aRCC patients with 
evidence of antigen -specific ly mphocy te infiltration in tumor tissues.2These reports have 
generated considerable interest in immunotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of aR CC 
patients, especiall y with advent of immune -check point inhibitors such as anti -PD1 and 
anti-PD L 1 antibodies in recent y ears. Upregulation of programmed death -1 (PD -1) receptor 
on tumor -infiltrating ly mphocy tes (TILs), and its ligand PD -L1 on tumors, a re associated 
with more aggressive disease and poor prognosis.3,4
Blocking the PD -1/PD -L1 interaction is a novel immunotherapeutic approach for aRCC 
which has shown single -agent efficacy  in patients whose disease has progressed following 
VEGF pathway  inhibitor therap y.6,7  BMS -936558, also named nivolumab, is a fully  
humanized an ti
-PD-1 antibody  (Bristol -Myers Squibb) that has shown anti- tumor activity  in 
296patients with solid cancers.5.Among these 296 patients, 33 patients had aRCC and were 
heavily  pretreated before nivolumab therap y.Nivolumab was given at a starting dose of 
1mg/kg and then expanded to 10 mg/kg.   The objective response rate (ORR) was 27% (9/33) 
and another 9 patients (27%) had stable disease at the 24- week follow -up time -point.   Five 
patients had durable response longer than 1 year.5  MK -3475 is a potent and highly  selective 
humanized monoclonal antibody
 (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isoty pe designed to directl y block 
the interaction between PD -[ADDRESS_762628] sorafenib in a randomized, open- label, Phase 3 trial.  Although the 
study  did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in median PFS (mPFS) 
between patients treated with axitinib or sorafenib, axitinib was associated with a longer 
mPFS value {median PFS of 10.1 months (95% CI 7.2,12.1) with axitinib vs. 6.5 months 
(95% CI 4.7, 8.3) with sorafenib, stratified hazard ratio 0.77, (95% CI 0.56, 1.05)}.  The

treatment of aRCC patients. The primary  objective of this study  will be to assess the safety  
and tolerability  of the combination regimen in previously  untreated aRCC patients.  
Secondary  objectives of this study  will include the assessment of objective response rate 
(ORR) and durati on of response (DR); progression -free survival (PFS); overall survival (OS) 
up to five y ears.  In addition, secondary  objectives will also include pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of axitinib and MK- [ADDRESS_762630] of MK -3475 on 
the PK of axitinib and translational component.  Specificall y, assessments in tumor and/or 
blood will include characterization of drug target pathway s (eg, PD -L1), and gene expression 
profiles. 
Once the tolerability  of the combination has been confirmed, a preliminary  assessment of its 
antitumor activity  will be conducted in an expansion cohort of aRCC patients in the first- line 
treatment setting. 
Study Objectives:
Primary Objective
To assess the safet y and tolerability of axitinib in combination with MK-3475 in 
patients with previously  untreated advanced RCC in order to estimate the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Secondary Objectives
To evaluate the overall safet y profile of axitinib in combination with MK -
3475.
To assess the anti -tumor activity  of axitinib in combination with MK -[ADDRESS_762631] -line treatment setting.
To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of axitinib and axitinib plus MK -
[ADDRESS_762632] of MK -3475 on the PK of 
axitinib.
To characterize, using translational approaches, genes and proteins such as PD -L1, 
VEGF -A and IL -[ADDRESS_762633] , renal cell carcinoma 
biology , and sensitivity /resis tance mechanisms to axitinib in combination with 
MK-3475 in tumor and/or blood. 
To explore the pharmacody namic effect of axitinib in combination with MK -3475 in 
blood and tumor by  [CONTACT_580033], RNAs and proteins including but not limited 
to VEGF -A, IL-8 and VEGFR2 and T -cell receptors.

Study Design:
This is a Phase 1b, open- label, multi -center, multiple -dose, safet y, PK and pharmacod ynamic 
study  of axitinib in combination with MK -3475 in adult patients with pr eviously  untreated 
advanced RCC.  This clinical study  will be composed of a Dose Finding Phase and a Dose 
Expansion Phase.  The Dose Finding Phase will estimate the MTD in patients with advanced 
RCC patients with clear cell histology who did not receive pr ior systemic therapy  for the 
advanced disease, using the modified toxicity  probability  interval (mTPI) method.
The Dose Finding Phase will lead to the identification of an Expansion Test Dose for axitinib 
in combination with MK -[ADDRESS_762634] Dose will be either the MTD (ie, the highest dose of axitinib 
and MK -3475 associated with the occurrence of DLTs in <33% of patients) or the RP2D, 
ie,the highest tested dose that is declared s afe and tolerable b y the Investigators and Sponsor.  
Once the Expansion Test Dose is identified, the Dose Expansion Phase will be opened and 
axitinib in combination with MK- 3475 will be tested in patients with previously  untreated 
aRCC. Approximately  60patients (including Dose Finding Phase and Dose Expansion 
Phase) are expected to be enrolled in the study .
Anti
-tumor activity  will be assessed b y radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline, 
12weeks, and every  6weeks thereafter, using RECI ST ver sion 1.1.  In addition, radiological 
tumor assessments will also be conducted whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, 
symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of End of Treatment/Withdrawal (if not done in 
the previous 6 weeks).  Brain CT or MRI scans are required at baseline and when there is a 
suspected brain metastasis.  Bone scan (bone scintigraph y) or 18F-FDG -PET/CT is required 
at baseline then every  12weeks onl y if bone metastases are present at baseline.  Otherwise 
bone imaging is required only if new bone metastases are suspected.  Bone imaging is also 
required at the time of confirmation of response for patients who have bone metastases. 
If radiologic imaging shows progressive disease (PD), tumor assessment should be repeated 
4weeks la ter in order to confirm PD.  Assigned study  treatment may  be continued at the 
investigator’s discretion while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression.  If PD is 
confirmed ( Section [IP_ADDRESS].1) patients may  be discontinued from study  treatment.  However, 
if a patient with evidence of PD is still experiencing clinical benefit according to the 
investigator’s judgment, he/she may  be eligible for continued treatment with one or both 
study  drugs (after discussion between the investigator and the Sponsor).  The details of the 
criteria for study  drug continuation in these patients are described in the Sections 3.1and 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.
Discontinuation from MK
-3475 treatment may  be considered at the investigator’s discretion 
for patients who have attained a confirmed CR, that have been treated for at least [ADDRESS_762635] dose of MK -3475, the patient meets the safet y parameters listed in the 
Inclusion /Exclusion criteria and the trial is open.  Patients will resume t herapy  at the same 
dose and schedule at the time of initial discontinuation.  MK- 3475 treatment will be 
administered for up to one additional y ear.
Patients will be monitored closely  for toxicity  and in the event of significant toxicity  dosing 
may be delay ed and/or reduced ( Section 5.2.7).  Based on the known safet y profile of 
axitinib, blood pressure as well as thy roid function will be monitored throughout the 
treatment period.  Based on data e merging from trials of VEGF ty rosine kinase inhibitors 
given in combination with PD -
[ADDRESS_762636] 3 cycles.49  MK -3475 dose modification and supportiv e care for drug related 
toxicities, including immune -
related adverse events (irAEs) Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Patients with 
unacceptable toxicity  attributed to one of the two drugs may
 be eligible for continued 
treatment with the other drug (after discussion between the Investigator and the Sponsor).
Intra -patient dose escalation for axitinib is permitted only  after completing 12 weeks of 
treatment if the starting dose of axitinib is 5 mg BID (DL1), and after 6 weeks if axitinib 
starting dose is 3 mg BID (DL -1) (Section 5.2.7 ).
MK-[ADDRESS_762637] competing elimination/metabolism pathway s, hence an 
overt PK interaction between th e two drugs is not anticipated.  However, pharmacokinetic 
assessments will be conducted in this study  to confirm the absence of drug -drug interactions.  
To understand the PK effects of MK -[ADDRESS_762638] of axitinib on MK -3475 will be evaluated b y comparing MK -3475 
trough concentrations at steady- state in the presence of axitinib with those reported for 
MK-3475 alone in prior studies.  MK -3475 has a long half -life (21 -28days) and an increase 
in trough concentration over time is expected. 
Archived tumor biospecimens, and baseline de novo biospecimens from metastatic lesions 
will be collected for all patients in the dose expansion cohort.  Every  effort will be made to 
obtain a second biops y at the time of first tumor assessment at [ADDRESS_762639] of the secondary  
objectives has been completed, this study  (A4061079) will remain open to give patients an 
opportunity  to continue to receive study  treatment as described in Section 3of this protocol. 
Guidance on the management of patients who continue on study  (ie, patients who are still 
clinically  benefiting from study  treatment without unacceptable toxicity  or disease 
progression and who have not withdrawn consent) is provided to in vestigators in Appendix 6. 
Clinical assessments will be reduced in scope and the required schedule of activities will be 
revised to maintain only  those assessments that protect the well -being of the patient.
Study Treatment:
Axitinib will be given orally  (PO) twice dail y (BID) on a continuous dosing schedule.  
MK-[ADDRESS_762640], or the study  is 
terminated b y the Sponsor (see Section 6.4, Patient Withdrawal). 
The treatment duration wi th MK -[ADDRESS_762641] dose 
of MK -
3475.  Continuation of treatment with MK- 3475 bey ond 24 months should be 
discussed with the sponsor and not go bey ond 36 months.
  Patients who stop MK -3475 for 
reasons other than conf irmed disease progression may  continue on treatment with axitinib 
single agent until disease progression (RECI ST v. 1.1), patient refusal, unacceptable toxicit y 
or the study  is prematurely  terminated by  [CONTACT_1034]; whichever comes first.
Statistical Metho ds:
Up-and-Down Design with the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_522154]/de- escalation rules will follow the modified toxicity  probability  interval 
(mTPI ) method.  Briefl y, the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_128574] a statistical probability  algorithm, 
calculated using all patients tr eated in prior and current cohorts at the same dose level) to 
determine when future cohorts should involve dose escalation, no change in dose, or dose 
de-escalation.
Rules for dose finding, using the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_12183], include the following:
The target enrollmen t cohort size is [ADDRESS_762642], the dose level will be deemed intolerable the dose level will 
be de -escalated.   If there are no safet y concerns, any  additional patients enrolled to 
this dose cohort will not be required to initiate dosing sequentially .
The next cohort (tar get 3 patients) can be enrolled when all patients at the current 
dose cohort have been evaluated for 6 weeks (ie, the first two treatment cy cles), or 
experience a DLT, whichever comes first.

planned first two cy cles (6 weeks) doses of axitinib or two infusions of MK -[ADDRESS_762643] that patient at the current d ose level.
The dose -finding component of the trial is completed when at least [ADDRESS_762644] dose associated with a DLT rate <0.33.  I t is 
estimated that approximately  20DLT -evaluable patients will need to be enrolled to 
reach 10 DLT-evaluable patients at the estimated MTD.
The proposed doses, schedule and PK time points may  be reconsidered and modified 
during the study  based on the emerging safet y and PK data.
Sample Size Determination
Due to the d ynamic nature of the cohort allocation procedure used in this study , the sample 
size of the Up -and-Down design using the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_580012].  
It is estimated that [ADDRESS_762645] a reliable and accurate estimate of the MTD.  The expansion cohort will enroll 
up to 40 patients at the estimated MTD.  The sample size estimate for the expansion cohort 
takes into consideration the key  tumor biomarker PD -L1 endpoints and historical data 
assuming 20% of RCC patients as tumor PD -L1 positive: if the observed rate of tumor 
PD-L1 positives patients is 20% then approximately  40patients would be required to enroll 
8PD-L1 tumor positive patients.
Dose Finding Criteria:
Dose escalation and de-escalation will follow an “Up -and-Down” design, using doses of 
MK-3475 and axitinib as shown in the Dose Levels in Dose Finding Phase Table 1. 
Dose Levels in Dose Finding Phase
Dose Level MK-3475 Axitinib
1 (Starting Dose Lev el) 2 mg/kg IV q3wk 5 mg BID
-1 2 mg/kg IV q3wk 3 mg BID
BID: twice daily; q3wk: every 3 w eeks
Dose level (DL) - 1 will be explored onl y if the MTD is alread y exceeded at DL 1. 
Alternative doses, schedule(s) and PK time points may  be considered during th e study  based 
on the emerging safet y and PK data.

bone metastases are present at baseline) see Section 7.5.  The CT scans should be performed w ith contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons.  
Thesame imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline will be employed in the follow ingtumor assessments.  
Antitumor activity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline, 12 w eeks th en every 6 weeks, whenever disease 
progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of End of Treatment/Withdraw al (if not done in the previous 6 weeks).   Follow up 
bone scans is required every [ADDRESS_762650] 
version 1.1.
18.Survival: All patients should be follow ed for survival at least every [ADDRESS_762651] patient enrolled in the study.
19.Adverse Events: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using NCI CTCAE version 4.03.  For SAEs, the active reporting period 
to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patien t’s 
participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_762652] MK -3475.  SAEs experienced by a patient after the active reporting period (see Section 8.1.1 ) has 
ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the Investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the Investigat or believes have at least a 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug are to be reported to the Sponsor.  AEs (serious and non serious) should be recorded on the Case Report 
Form  (CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least one dose of study treatment through last patient visit (Day [ADDRESS_762653] dose).  If a patient begins a 
new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non serious AEs ends at the time the new  treatment is started.  Pregnancy or breast feeding that occur 
during the trial, within 120 days of discontinuing treatment with MK -3475, or w ithin 28 days after the cessation of study treatment if the patient begins a 
new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, should be reported as in Section 8.4(Exposure During Pregnancy ).
20.Concom itant Medications/Treatm ents: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from [ADDRESS_762654] dose of study treatment.  All concomitant medications should be recorded in the CRF including supportive care drugs 
(eg,anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), and the drugs used to treat adverse events or chronic diseases, and non -drug supportive interventions 
(eg,transfusions). 
21.Registration: Patient number and dose level allocation operated by [CONTACT_3954].  Required information: site and patient identifiers and demographic 
information.  Study treatment (either single agent axitinib for patients in Lead -in or axitinib in combination with MK -3475 for all other patients) should 
begin within 7 days of registration.

Page 1423.Pharm acokinetics : Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule for Pharamcokinetic Samples Collection Table. Pharmacokinetic 
samples for MK -[ADDRESS_762655] 8 patients in the Dose Expansion Phase.  Details are outli ned in Section 7.2.  
24.Serum Biom arkers : Blood biospecimens (10 mL) will be obtained to measure DNA, RNA or protein markers known or suspected to be of relevance to the 
mechanis m of action, the development of resistance or the identification of those patients who might benefit from treatment with axit inib in combination 
with MK -3475.  Blood biospecimens will be collected at screening, Cycle 2 Day 1 predose, and End of Treatment/W ithdraw al whichever comes first.  See 
Section 7.3.2 .
25.Whole Blood Biomarkers : Blood biospecimen (10 mL) will be obtained to measure DNA, RNA or protein markers known or suspecte d to be of relevance 
to the mechanism of action, the development of resistance or the identification of those patients who might benefit from treatm ent with axitinib in 
combination with MK- 3475.  Blood samples will be collected at screening, Cycle 2 Day 1 predose, and End of Treatment/Withdrawal whichever comes 
first.  See Section 7.3.2
26.Banked Biospecimen: A single 4 mL blood sample will be collected at screening.  Banked biospe cimens will be collected for the purpose of conducting 
research; specific uses are described in the Banked Biospecimens section.  Comparing the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein, 
and metabolite variation patterns of patients who respond w ell and those who respond poorly to treatment may help to better define the most appropriate 
group of patients in which to target a given treatment.  Collecting biospecimens for exploratory pharmacogenomic/genomic/biom arker analyses and 
retaining them in the Biospecimen Banking System (BBS) make it possible to better understand the investigational product’s me chanism of action and to 
seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, tolerability, safety, and/or efficacy not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study.  Banked 
biospecimens retained in the BBS also can be used in research on RCC.  Providing these biospecimens is a required study activ ity for study sites and 
patients, unless prohibited by [CONTACT_168047] (EC) decision.  See Section 7.4.
27.Archival Tumor Tissue: Mandatory Archival Biospecimen from primary diagnosis for all patients enrolled in the s tudy (Dose Finding and Dose Expansion 
Phases).  Formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) block(s) from initial diagnosis.   If no FFPE block is available, then at least 12 unbaked, unstained 
slides containing FFPE tissue sections that are 4 microns (preferr ed) or 5 microns (acceptable) thick must be provided.  How ever FFPE blocks are strongly 
encouraged over slides.  See Section 7.3.1 .
28.De Novo Tum or Biospecimens: Baseline de novo tumor biospecimens from metastatic tumor sites are mandatory for all patients enrolled in the Dose 
Expansion Phase.  Baseline de novo tissue biopsies taken from metastatic lesions prior to the date of screening are acceptable.   For all patients in the Dos e 
Expansion cohort, a second biopsy is strongly encouraged at the time of first tumor assessment after 12 w eeks.   If possible the tumor biospecimen at 
12weeks should come from the same baseline anatomical location.   Formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE ) block(s) of metastatic lesion tumor 
biospecimens from baseline de novo biopsies that contain sufficient tissue to generate at least [ADDRESS_762656] 
be provided.  How ever FFPE blocks are strongly encouraged over slides.  See Section 7.3.1 .
29.Anti -MK-3475 Antibodies (anti -drug antibodies, ADA): One blood sample (6 mL) for anti -MK-[ADDRESS_762657] es should be drawn within 24 hours before start of MK -3475 
infusion.  Additional samples for anti -MK-3475 antibodies (and simultaneous pharmacokinetic draws for measurement of MK- 3475) w ill be collected at 
30days, 3 months and 6 months after the end of MK -3475 treatment.  See Section 7.2.5 .

1.2.Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Renal Cell Cancer
An estimated 65,150 new cases of kidney  cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United 
States (US) in 2013.  This includes 93% RCC, 6% renal pelvis cancer and 1% Wilms tumor.  
An estimated 13,680 patients will die from kidney cancer in 2013.12
RCC arises from the renal epi[INVESTIGATOR_241117] 5 major subty
pes are currently recognized.  
Approximately  70-80% of these are clear cell RCC tumors while other less common cell 
types include papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]  (TypeI and II), chromophobe, collecting duct and unclassified 
RCC.[ADDRESS_762668] been identified –MET protooncogene, von 
Hippel -Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL ), fumarate h ydratase tumor suppressor gene 
(FH), and Birt -Hogg -
Dubé tumor suppressor gene ( BHD ).
Patients with von Hippel- Lindau disease have a >70% risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_128572].  
This hereditary  form of RCC is caused by  [CONTACT_128627] 3p.  More than 90% of sporadic clear cell RCC involves somatic VHL
gene mutations or meth ylation.  VHL gene mutations lead to loss of function of the VHL 
protein, accumulation of hy poxia -inducible transcription fact ors (eg, HIF -1alpha and HIF -
2 
alpha) which translocate to the nucleus and increase transcription of angiogenesis factors 
(such as VEGF and platelet derived growth factor [PDGF]) which induce tumorigenesis.  
Clear cell RCC is a highly  vascular tumor with hi gh expression of VEGF, VEGFRs and 
PDGF receptor.[ADDRESS_762669] of patients with clear cell RCC present with Stage IV disease.  Sy stemic 
therap y is given to patients with advanced disease (relapsed or Stage IV) that is not amenable 
to complete resection.  However, it is recommended that these patients undergo a 
cytoreductive nephrectomy  where possible, prior to beginning sy stemic therapy , as per 
treatment guidelines.[ADDRESS_762670] line systemic therapy  is usuall y one of the 
VEGFR TKI s (sunitinib, pazopanib, or sorafenib), the monoclonal ant i-VEGF antibody  
bevacizumab (given in combination with I FN alpha) or the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus.  
The same targeted agents or the VEGFR TKI axitinib, or the mTOR inhibitor everolimus are 
used individually  in subsequent lines of therap y for advanced c lear cell RCC.15,16,17,18

[IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib (INLYTA, AG - 013736)
Axitinib (I NLYTA, AG -
013736) is an oral, small molecule, TKI selective for VEGFRs 1, 2 
and 3 and is approved multinationally  for the treatment of advanced RCC after failure of one 
prior sy stemic therapy  (actual indication varies according to region/country). 
Axitinib is an adeno sine triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitor that binds to the 
unphosphory lated (non
-activated) “DFG -out” conformation of the catal ytic domain of a 
receptor ty rosine kinase.  I n enzy matic assay s, axitinib was found to be highly  potent 
(Ki=28 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36379]) against the kinase activity  of juxta -membrane (JM) domain containing 
human VEGFR 2 recombinant protein.19  In additional kinase assay s, axitinib showed potent 
and ATP -competitive inhibition of the VEGFRs 1, 2, a nd 3 and PDGFR
-, but not other 
closely -related famil y kinases.  Receptor binding studies and cell- based assay s, confirmed 
that axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGFRs 1, 2, and 3.  Axitinib was shown 
to have antiangiogenic activity  in a num ber of models including spontaneous pancreatic 
islet-cell tumors of RI P-TAG -2 transgenic mice model and demonstrated antitumor efficacy  
including marked cy toreductive antitumor activity , in multiple tumor models implanted in 
athymic mice. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Safety and Efficacy of Axitinib
The safet y and efficacy  of axitinib were evaluated in a randomized, open
-label, multicenter 
Phase 3 study .  Patients with advanced RCC (99% clear cell) whose disease had progressed 
on or after treatment with 1 prior sy stemic therap y, including sunitinib -, bevacizumab -, 
temsirolimus- , or cy tokine -containing regimens were randomized to receive axitinib (N=361) 
or sorafenib (N=362).  There was a statisticall y significant advantage for axitinib over 
sorafenib for the primary PFS endpoin t, 6.7 (95% CI : 6.3, 8.6) vs 4.7 (95% CI : 4.6, 5.6) 
months, respectivel y (p <0.0001).  There was no statistically significant difference between 
the treatment arms in the secondary  overall survival (OS) endpoint, 20.1 (95% CI : 16.7, 23.4) 
vs 19.2 (95% CI : 17.5, 22.3) for axitinib and sorfenib, respectively .  The objective response 
rate (ORR) was 19.4% (95% CI : 15.4, 23.9) for axitinib and 9.4% (95% CI : 6.6, 12.9) for 
sorafenib.  The most common ( 20%) adverse reactions observed in this study  following 
treatment with axitinib were diarrhea, hy pertension, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, 
dysphonia, palmar -plantar ery throd ysesthesia (hand- foot) s yndrome, weight decreased, 
vomiting, asthenia, and constipation.9
In a randomized, open -label, Phase 3 trial, treatment -naïve clear cell RCC patients were 
randomized (2:1) to receive axitinib (N=192) or sorafenib (N=96).  There was no significant 
difference in median PFS between patients treated with axitinib or sorafenib 10.1 months 
(95% CI 7.2,12.1) vs 6.5 months (95% CI  4.7, 8.3), respectivel y, with stratified hazard ratio 
0.77, (95% CI 0.56, 1.05).  The axitinib ORR assessed by  [CONTACT_580036] 32%, risk ratio 2.21, (95% CI 1.31, 3.75, stratified one sided p=0.0006).  The most 
common adverse events ( 20%) observed with axitinib were diarrhea, h ypertension, weight 
decrease, fatigue, decreased appetite, palmar- plantar ery throd ysesthesia (hand- foot) 
syndrome, d ysphonia, asthenia, hy pothy roidism and nause a.[ADDRESS_762671] common adverse 
events (>20% of patients) report ed from 699 cancer patients regardless of causality  included 
diarrhea, fatigue, h ypertension, decrease appetite, nausea, d ysphonia, palmar -plantar 
erythrody saesthesia s yndrome, weight decreased, vomiting, constipation, headache, cough, 
arthralgia, d yspnea, and hemorrhagic events (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], hematuria, hemopty sis, 
rectal hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, gastric hemorrhage, and lower gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage).  In addition, hy pothy roidism and proteinuria were reported in 17.5% and 
16.7% of the pa tients, respectivel y.

The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades.25  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating ly mphocy tes 
(TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.26,27,28,29,30In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of 
CD8+ effector T -cells/FoxP3+ regulatory  T
-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis 
and long -term survival in many  solid tumors. 
The Programmed Death -1 (PD -1) receptor -ligand interaction is a ma jor pathway  hijacked b y 
tumors to suppress immune control.  The normal function of PD- 1, expressed on the cell 
surface of activated T -cells under health y conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or 
excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions .  PD -1 (encoded by  [CONTACT_426060]1) is an Ig superfamily  member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to 
negativel y regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or 
PD-L2).31,32  The structure of murine PD - 1 has been resolved.33  PD-1 and family  members 
are typeI transmembrane gly coproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cy toplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of 
signaling molecules.  The cy toplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine
-based signaling 
motifs, an immunoreceptor ty rosine -based inhibition motif (I TIM) and an immunoreceptor
tyrosine- based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T- cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_762672] from that of CTLA- 4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].37,38  PD-1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated l ymphocy tes including periphe ral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and 
Natural Killer cells.39
,40  Expression has also been shown during thy mic development on 
CD4- CD8- (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.41  
The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively  expressed or can be induced in a 
variet y of cell types, including non -hematopoietic tissues as well as in various 
tumors.42,43,44,[ADDRESS_762673] notably  on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is 
only detectabl y expressed on antigen
-presenting cells found in ly mphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory  environments. PD-L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in 
lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T- cell function in peripheral 
tissues.37  Although healthy  organs express little (if any ) PD- L1, a variety  of cancers were 
demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to 
regulate tumor -specific T- cell expansion in patients with melanoma (MEL).45  This sugges ts 
that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway  play s a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be 
considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
MK-3475 is a potent and highly  selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isot ype designed to directl y block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, 
PD-L1 and PD -L2. Pembrolizumab [Key truda(US); previously  known as lambrolizumab, 
MK-3475 and SCH 9000475] is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal 
antibody  (mAb) o
f the IgG4/kappa isoty pe designed to directl y block the interaction between 
PD-1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.  Pembrolizumab was recentl y approved in the US 
for the treatment of advanced, unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma, and for use in

BRAF inhibitor, in the case of BRAF V600 -mutant disease.50
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Safety and Efficacy of MK-3475
The safet y of MK-3475 is being assessed in six ongoing clinical trials, PN001, PN002, 
PN006, PN010, PN011 and PN012.  Safety  data of single -agent MK -3475 are onl y available 
from Study  PN001 at this time.  Protocol 001 (PN001) is an open- label Phase 1 study , which 
includes a dose-escalation component in patients with solid tumors (Part A) and with 
subsequent expansion cohorts in patients with melanoma (Parts B and D) and NSCL C (Parts 
C and F).  PN001 Part A evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, 
administe red Q2W.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting toxicities 
were observed.  Based on PK data showing a half -life of 21 day s, the protocol was amended 
to include a dosing frequency  of Q3W in the expansion cohorts (Parts B through F).
Preliminary  data (as of 26 July  2013) are available from 479 patients enrolled in PN001: 
PartA (n=30) 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg MK -3475 dosed Q2W to Q3W, Part B 
(n=308) 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg MK -3475 dosed Q2W to Q3W, Part C (n=38) 10 mg/kg 
MK-3475 dosed Q3W, and Part D (n=103) 2 or 10 mg/kg MK -[ADDRESS_762674] received MK -3475 in Protocol 001, 466 (97.3%) experienced 
treatment emergent adverse events ( AEs)of which 368 (76.8%) were considered 
drug-
related.  Serious adverse events ( SAE s )were reported in 30.1% of patients, but SAEs 
that were attributed as potentially  (possibly , probably , or definitely ) drug -related by  
[CONTACT_458526] 6.7% of patients overall.  Potentially  immune -related AEs 
have been observed , including pneumonitis (
Grade 1-2)in both melanoma and NSCL C 
cohorts.  The most commonly  reported treatment emergent AEs experienced are fatigue, 
nausea, cough, pruritus, diarrhea and rash. Most patients continued treatment in spi[INVESTIGATOR_580013], a nd onl y 4.2% of patients discontinued study  treatment due to an AE that was 
considered related to study  treatment by  [CONTACT_4718].

Page 26Of the 162 patients who received 2 mg/kg MK -3475 dosed Q3W (Parts B1, B2 and D) in 
PN001, 160 (98.8%) experienced treatment emergent AEs of which 128 (79.0%) were 
considered to be drug -related .  SAEs were reported in 27.2% of patients, but SAEs that were 
attributed as potentially  (possibly , probabl y, or definitely ) drug -related b y Investigators were 
reported in 9.3% of this subset of patients.  The most commonly  reported treatment emergent 
AEs experienced in this subset up patients are fatigue, nausea, cough, pruritus, rash and 
diarrhea.
Thus, the overall AE summary  suggests that MK -[ADDRESS_762675] 
generated considerable interests in immunotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of aRCC 
patients, especiall y with advent of immune -check point inhi bitors such as anti -PD1 and anti 
PDL1 antibodies in recent y ears.  Upregulations of programmed death -1 (PD -1) receptor on 
tumor -infiltrating ly mphocy tes, and its ligand PD -L1 on tumors are associated with more 
aggressive disease and poor prognosis.3,4  
Blocking the PD -1/PD -L1 interaction in aRCC is a novel immunotherapeutic approach, 
which has shown single agent efficacy  in patients whose disease have progressed following 
VEGF pathw ay inhibitor therap y.6,7  BMS -936558, also named nivolumab, is a fully  
humanized anti
-PD-1 antibody  (Bristol -Myers Squibb) that has shown anti- tumor activity  in 
296 patients with solid cancers.5  Among these 296 patients, 33 patients had aRCC and were 
heavily  pretreated before nivolumab therapy . Nivolumab was given at a starting dose of 
1mg/kg and then expanded to 10 mg/kg .  The objective response rate (ORR) was 27% (9/33) 
and another 9 patients (27%) had stable disease at the 24- week follow -up. Five patients had 
durable response longer than [ADDRESS_762676] sorafenib in a randomized, open- label, phase 3 trial.  Although the study  
did not demonstrate statistically  significant difference in median PFS between patients 
treated with axitinib or sorafenib , axitinib was associated with a longer mPFS value {median 
PFS of 10.1 months (95% CI  7.2,12.1) with axitinib vs. 6.5 months (95% CI  4.7, 8.3) with 
sorafenib, stratified hazard ratio 0.77, (95% CI 0.56, 1.05)}.  The median PFS observed with 
axitinib in thi s study  was similar to those demonstrated earlier in phase [ADDRESS_762677] of the secondary  
objectives of the stud y has been completed, this study (A40610 79) will remain open to give 
patients an opportunity  tocontinue to receive study  treatment as described in Section 3 of 
this protocol. 
Guidance on the management of patients who continue on study  (ie, patients 
who are still clinically  benefiting from stud y treatment without unacceptable toxicity  or 
disease progression and who have not withdrawn consent) is provided to investigators in 
Appendix 6. Clinical assessments will be reduced in scope and the required schedule of 
activities will be revised to mainta in only  those assessments that protect the well -being of the 
patient.
1.2.4. Rationale for Axitinib and MK -
3475 Starting Doses in This Trial
[IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib Starting Dose
In this trial, the axitinib starting dose will be 5 mg BI D with or without food.  This dose has 
proven to be safe and efficacious in RCC and has been approved b y regulatory  authorities 
worldwide.
[IP_ADDRESS]. MK-3475 Starting Dose and Regimen
In this trial, the MK -3475 starting dose will be 2 mg/kg to be administered every  3 weeks 
(Q3W), based on the following observations: 
The MK -3475 Phase 1 dose escalation study  in patients with solid tumors showed 
that MK -3475 was safe at the tested dose levels (1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, 
administered every  2weeks) without reaching a maximum tolerated dose.  I n 
addition, clinical responses were observed at all the dose levels.21

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 28The dose of 2 mg/kg dosed Q3W was well tolerated based on published21single agent 
safet y and tolerability data from the Phase [ADDRESS_762678] -in-human study  (PN001). In this 
study , MK -3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of 
tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  P K 
data anal ysis of MK -3475 administered in Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life, t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_580014] (refer to MK -3475 I B).  Pharmacody namic data (IL -2 release assay ) 
suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early  PK and 
pharmacod ynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing either Q2W or Q3W 
dosing schedules.
In the ongoing PN001 protocol, patients with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]- naïve or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -pretreate d advanced melanoma were treated on three different dosing 
regimens of MK -3475: 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W.  An 
interim analy sis has suggested that there are no major differences in the safety  profile 
or overall objective response rate for the doses of 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg given Q3W.

3.STUDY DESIGN
3.1.Study Overview
This is a Phase 1b, open
-label, multi -center, multiple -dose, safet y, PK and pharmacod ynamic 
study  of axitinib in combination with MK -3475 in adult patients with previously  untreated 
advanced RCC.  This clinical study  will be composed of a Dose Finding Phase and a Dose 
Expansion Phase.  The Dose Finding Phase w ill estimate the MTD in patients with advanced 
RCC patients with clear cell histology  who did not receive any  prior s ystemic therapy  for 
their advanced disease, using the modified toxicity probability  interval (mTPI ) method.

AG-013736, MK -[ADDRESS_762682] Dose will be either the MTD (ie, the highest dose of 
axitinib and MK -3475 associated with the occurrence of DLTs in <33% of patients) or the 
RP2D, ie, the highest tested dose that is declared safe and tolerable b y the Investigators and 
Sponsor.  Once the Expansion Test Dose is identified, the Dose Expansion Phase will be 
open ed and axitinib in combination with MK -3475 will be tested in patients with previously  
untreated advanced RCC. 
Approximately  60patients (including Dose Finding Phase and Dose Expansion Phase) are 
expected to be enrolled in the study .

on a continuous dosing schedule.  MK -[ADDRESS_762683], or the study  is terminated by  [CONTACT_1034] (see Section 6.4Study  
Withdrawal). 
Patients will be monitored closely  for toxicity  and in the event of significant toxicity  dosing 
may be delay ed and/or reduced ( Section 5.2.7).  Axitin ib and MK -3475 dose modifications 
for drug -related toxicities are described in the 
Table 5and Table 6.  Based on the known 
safet y profile of axitinib, blood pressure as well as thyroid fu nction will be monitored 
throughout the treatment period.  Axitinib treatment may  be adjusted by  [CONTACT_580037] ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Based on data emerging fr om trials of 
VEGF ty rosine kinase inhibitors given in combination with PD -[ADDRESS_762684] 3 cycles.49  MK -3475 dose modification and

Page 31supportive care for drug related toxicities, including immune -related adverse events (irAEs 
are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Intra -patient dose escalation for axitinib is permitted only  after completing 12 week s of 
treatment if the starting dose of axitinib is 5 mg BID (DL1), and after 6 weeks if axitinib 
starting dose is 3 mg BID (DL -1) (Section 5.2.7).
The treatment duration with MK -[ADDRESS_762685] dose 
of MK -
3475.  Continuation of treatment with MK- 3475 bey ond 24 months should be 
discussed with the sponsor and not go bey ond 36 months.  After completing treatment with 
MK-3475, patients experiencing objective r esponse or stable disease may  continue on 
treatment with axitinib single agent until disease progression, patient refusal, unacceptable 
toxicity  or the stud y is prematurel y terminated b y the Sponsor; whichever comes first (please 
see Section 6.4, Patient Withdrawal).
Discontinuation from MK
-3475 may  be considered at the investigator’s discretion for 
patients who have attained a confirmed CR, have received at least [ADDRESS_762686] dose of MK -3475, the patient still meets the safety  parameters listed in 
the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and the trial is still open.  Pat ients will resume MK
-[ADDRESS_762687] at the time of discontinuation.  MK -3475 
treatment will be administered for up to one additional y ear.
Patients with unacceptable toxicity  attributed to one of the two drugs may be el igible for 
continued treatment with the other drug (after discussion between the Investigator and the 
Sponsor). 
Tumor assessment: Anti- tumor activity  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_580038], then at [ADDRESS_762688] 
version 1.1.  In addition, radiological tumor assessments will also be conducted whenever 
disease progression is suspected (eg, s ymptomatic deterioration), and at the time of End of 
Treatment/Withdrawal (if not done in the prev ious 6 weeks).  In determining whether or not 
the tumor burden has increased or decreased, Investigators should consider all target lesions 
as well as non- target lesions according to RECI ST v 1.1 (see Study  Reference Manual).
If radiologic imaging shows PD , tumor assessment should be repeated 4weeks later in 
order to confirm PD.  Assigned study  treatment may  be continued at the investigator’s 
discretion while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression.  If repeat imaging does not 
confirm PD, study  treatment may  be continued/resumed.   Patients that are deemed clinicall y 
unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation of PD and can discontinue 
treatment immediatel y.

A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 32If the repeat imaging confirms PD ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) patients may  be discontinued from 
treatment.  However, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment and after discussion 
between the investigator and the Sponsor, if a patient with evidence of disease progr ession is 
still experiencing clinical benefit, he/she will be eligible for continued treatment with single 
agent axitinib, MK
-3475 or axitinib combined with MK -3475 as long as the following 
criteria are met: 
Absence of clinical signs and sy mptoms of disea se progression. 
No decline in performance status. 
Absence of rapid progression of disease b y radiographic imaging. 
Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention. 
Brain CT or MRI  scans are required at baseline and when there is a suspected brain 
metastasis.  Bone scans: Bone scan (bone scintigraphy ) or 18F-FDG -PET/CT is required at 
baseline then every  12weeks only  if bone metastases are present at baseline.  Otherwise bone 
imaging is required only
 if new bone metastases are suspected.  Bone imaging is also 
required at the time of confirmation of response for patients who have bone metastases. 
Retrospective central review of all imaging time points may be performed for t his study , 
therefore all imaging source data should be retained at the site and be available for future 
inspection or further analysis.  Additional information is included in the Study  Reference 
Manual.
Pharmacokinetic assessment: MK-[ADDRESS_762689] competing 
elimination/metabolism pathway s, hence an overt PK interaction between the two drugs is 
not anticipated.  However, pharmacokinetic assessments will be conducted in this study  to 
confirm the absence of drug- drug interactions.  To understan d the PK effects of MK -[ADDRESS_762690] 8 patients in the Dose Expansion Phase of 
the study .  Axitinib has a plasma half life of 2.5 -4.1hours and is expected to reach 
steady -state within 2 to 3 days of dosing.  MK -3475 has a long plasma half- life (21-28 days) 
and trough concentrations increase with successive doses until steady  state, which is 
expected within [ADDRESS_762691] 
8patients (target is 8 PK evaluable patients) from the Dose Expansion Phase will participate 
in PK assessments, therefore these patients will undergo the 7 -day lead -in period for axitinib.   
There will be no lead -in period for the remaining patients in the Dose Expansion Phase.

Page 33Tumor biopsy  assessment and translational studies: Archived (all patients) and baseline 
denovo tumor biospecimens from metastatic lesions (Dose Expansi on Phase only ) will be 
collected for retrospective assessment. For all patients in the Dose Expansion Phase, a 
second tumor biopsy  is strongly  encouraged at the time of first tumor assessment 
(ie,12weeks) to assess the effects of the combination on the relevant pathway s.  Biomarker 
studies on tumor biospecimens including but not limited to tumor PD- L1 expression and 
blood levels of VEGF -A, IL -8 and VEGFR -2, will be carried out to help understand the 
mechanism of action of the axitinib plus MK-3475 combination, pharmacody namic effects, 
as well as potential mechanisms of sensitivity  and resistance.  Such results may  help in the 
future development of this combination.  Analy ses using translational approaches may  also 
result in the identification of potential biomarkers of response to the axitinib plus MK -
3475 
combination, ultimately  leading to development of a patient selection strategy  for further 
clinical investigation.  As such collection of tumor tissue and blood specimens at baseline 
and on study  will be of paramount importance.
3.1.1. Dose Finding Phase
[IP_ADDRESS]. Starting Doses for Axitinib and MK-3475 (Dose Level 1)
The starting doses (Dose Level 1) are axitinib 5 mg BI D and MK -3475 2 mg/Kg IV Q3W in 
three -week cy cles. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Criteria for Dose Finding 
Dose finding will follo w an “Up -and-Down” design, using doses of MK- 3475 and axitinib as 
shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Dose Levels in the Dose Finding Phase
Dose Level MK-3475 Axitinib
1 (Starting Dose Level) 2 mg /kg IV q3wk 5 mg BID
-1 2 mg /kg IV q3wk 3 mg BID
BID: twice daily; q3wk: every 3 w eeks
Possible dose finding scenarios based on the starting (1) dose level tolerability  are illustrated 
in Table 2.  DL -1 will be explored onl y if the MTD is exc eeded alread y at DL 1. 
In this dosing algorithm there are up to 2 potential dose levels (DL): (DL -1) MK -
3475 
2mg/kg q3wk + axitinib 3 mgBID and (DL1) MK -3475 2 mg/kg q3wk + axitinib 5 mg BID. 
Alternative doses, schedule(s) and PK time points may  be reco nsidered during the study  
based on the emerging safety  and PK data.
There are several potential dosing finding sequences for MK -3475 + axitinib.  The specific 
sequence to be followed depends upon the number of patients enrolled in the study  and the 
number of DLTs observed at each specific dose combination.  The sequences are mutuall y 
exclusive, meaning onl y one of the sequences will be followed through the course of the 
study .  Some possible sequences are listed below in Table 2.

If the dose is de -escalated to DL -1 and the total number of patients then treated at DL -1 is 3
the followin g dosing rules are applied:
0 DL Ts  escalate back to DL 1; 
1 DL T remain at the same dose (DL -1);
2-3 DLTs de-escalation not possible consider DL -1 as intolerable.
Rules for dose -finding, using the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_12183], include the following:
The target enrollment cohort size is [ADDRESS_762693] one, the dose level will be deemed 
intolerable and the dose level will be de -escalated.  If there are no safety  concerns, 
any additional patients enrolled to this dose cohort will not be required to initiate 
dosing s equentially .
The next cohort can be enrolled when all patients at the current dose cohort have been 
evaluated for 6 weeks (ie, the first 2 treatment cy cles), or experience a DLT, 
whichever comes first.
If a patient withdraws from study  treatment before rec eiving at least 75% of the 
planned first two cy cles dose of axitinib or two infusions of MK -[ADDRESS_762694] that patient at the current dose level.
The dose -finding component of the trial is completed when [ADDRESS_762695] dose associated with DLT rate <0.33.  I t is 
estimated that approximately  20DLT -evaluable patients will need to be enrolled to 
reach 10 DLT-evaluable patients at the estimated MTD.
The proposed doses, schedule, and PK timepoints may  be reconsidered and amended 
during the study  based on the emerging safet y and pharmacokinetic data.
The RP2D will be confirmed in the Dose Expansion Ph ase, taking into account the 
MTD determination from the Dose Finding Phase, and other factors related to safet y, 
efficacy , and PK/PD involving all available data from test cohorts.
No intrapatient dose escalation will be permitted in the Dose Finding Phase .

The Expansion Test Dose will be the MTD identified in the Dose Escalation Phase .  Further 
experience in the Dose Expansion Phase cohort may  result in the need to explore a lower 
Expansion Te st Dose.

Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 373.3.1. Dose Expansion Phase
All patients in the Dose Expansion Phase may  be enrolled simultaneously .
3.4. Recommended Phase 2 Dose Definition
The RP2D is the dose of axitinib and MK -3475 in combination chosen for further clinical 
development.  If the MTD prov es to be clinically  feasible for long term administration in a 
reasonable number of patients, this dose usually  becomes the RP2D.  Further experience in 
the Dose Expansion Cohort may  result in a RP2D dose lower than the MTD.
For axitinib, intra -patient dose escalation to higher doses may  be permitted after 12 weeks of 
treatment if the starting dose of axitinib is 5 mg BID (DL1), and after 6 weeks if axitinib 
starting dose is 3 mg BID (DL -1) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

4.3.Life Style Guidelines 
4.3.1. Contraception
In this stud y, fertile male patients and female patients who are of childbear ing potential will 
receive axitinib, which has been associated with teratogenic risk, in combination with 
MK-3475.  Patients who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], sexually  active and at risk for 
pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use [ADDRESS_762713] dose.  The Investigator 
or his or her designee, in consultation with the patient, will confirm that the patient has
selected 2 appropriate metho
ds of contraception for the individual patient and his or her 
partner(s) from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that 
the patient has been instructed in their consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated in 
the Schedule of A ctivities, the investigator or designee will inform the patient of the need to 
use 2 highly  effective methods of contraception consistently  and correctly  and document the 
conversation, and the patient’s affirmation, in the patient’s chart.  In addition, the 
Investigator or designee will instruct the patient to call immediately  if 1 or both of the 

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 42selected contraception methods is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the 
patient or partner.
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
Established use of hormonal methods of contraceptio n associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal),  provided the patient 
or male patient’s female partner plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the 
entire study  and has been using that hormonal cont raceptive for an adequate period of 
time to ensure effectiveness.
Correctl y placed copper containing intrauterine device (IUD).
Male condom or female condom used WI TH a separate spermicide product (ie,foam, 
gel, film, cream, suppository ).  For countries where spermicide is not available or 
condom plus spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, this option 
is not appropriate.
Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate.
Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive 
procedure (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the 
device’s label).
4.4.Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact [CONTACT_1133]'s appropriately qualified medical personnel f or the 
trial is documented in the study  contact [CONTACT_580040].
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y related medical 
questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact [CONTACT_1137].  The co ntact card contains, 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study  number, 
contact [CONTACT_36535] a help desk in the event 
that the investigational site staff cannot be reac hed to provide advice on a medical question 
or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients 
participation in the study .  The help desk number can also be used by  [CONTACT_580041] m edical questions or problems, however it should only  be used in 
the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigational site and 
the study  team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the 
established communication pathway s between the investigational site and study  team for 
advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y.  The help desk 
number is not intended for use b y the patient directly and if a patient calls that number they 
will be directed back to the investigational site.

5.2.2. Preparation and Dispensing
Only  qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
them and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of 
chemotherapeutic agents.
Axitinib will be dispensed in opaque plastic bottles to protect the compounds from light.  
Axitinib is a hazardous drug (due to possibl e reproductive toxicity ), and should be handled 
according to the recommended procedures described in the current edition of the American 
Society  of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128579] (ASHP), Technical Assistance Bulletin on Handling 
Cytotoxic and Hazardous Drugs, Americ an Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_522164] (AHFS) Drug 
Information (1999) and its references.  Procedures described in each institution’s pharmacy  
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_453133].
Axitinib will be provide d in quantities appropriate for the stud y visit schedule.  A qualified 
staff member will provide the study  medication via a unique container number using the drug 
management s ystem.
Axitinib will be dispensed every  3weeks or as otherwise indicated.  Patients should be 
instructed to keep their medication in the bottles provided and not transfer it to any other 
container.  In the event of dose modification, a request should be made of the patient to 
return all previousl y dispensed medication to the clinic.
MK-3475 will be dosed at the investigational site as indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Specific preparation and dispensing instructions are provided in the Dosage Administration 
Instruction located in the Study  Manual.
5.2.3. Administration
All trial treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib
Axitinib will be administered orally  BID at approximately  the same time in the morning and 
evening on a continuous daily  dosing schedule, ie, with out a break in dosing in the absence 
of drug -related toxicit y (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Axitinib tablets are to be taken approximatel y 
12hours apart and may  be administered without regard to mea ls.  Tablets must not be 
crushed, split or dissolved and patients should be instructed to swallow the study  medication 
whole without manipulation or chewing of the medication prior to swallowing. 
A dosing card will be provided to the patients to provide g uidance for the correct use of the 
two drugs. 
Patients must be instructed that if they  miss a dose or vomit any time after taking a dose, they  
must not “make it up” with an extra dose, but instead resume subsequent doses as prescribed.  
Any missed dose may be taken late up to [ADDRESS_762714] all doses (missed or vomited doses) in a 
dosing dia ry supplied by  [CONTACT_779].  If doses are missed or vomited, this must be indicated in 
the source documents and CRFs.

[IP_ADDRESS]. MK-3475 Timing of Dose Administration
MK-3475 will be administered on Day 1 of each cy cle after all procedures/assessments have 
been completed as detailed in the Schedule of Activities table.  Trial treatment may be 
administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cy cle due to 
administrative reasons.
MK-3475 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every  3-weeks, next cy cle 
administration may  be delay ed due to persisting toxicity  as described in Section 5.2.7. 
See the Dosage and Administration I nstructions (DAI), for instructions on how to prepare the 
investigational product for administration.  I
nvestigational product sh ould be prepared and 
dispensed by  [CONTACT_274234]

A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 46Sites should make ever y effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible.  However, given the variability  of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of 
-5minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 30 minutes: -5min/+10 min).  
The ex act duration of infusion should be recorded in both sources document and CRFs.
The dose amount required to prepare the MK -3475 infusion solution will be based on the 
patient’s weight in kilograms (kg).
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be define d as an y dose 20% over the prescribed 
dose for the standard treatments.  No specific information is available on the treatment of 
overdose of MK -3475.  In the event of overdose, the patient should be observed closel y for 
signs of toxicity .  Appropriate su pportive treatment should be provided if clinically  indicated. 
If a dose of MK -3475 meeting the protocol definition of overdose is administered without 
inducing any  associated clinical sy mptoms or abnormal laboratory  results, then the overdose 
is reported in CRF as a non- serious adverse event, using the terminology  “accidental or 
intentional overdose without adverse effect.” Also see Section 5.2.5 Medication Errors.

with axitinib single agent until disease progression (RECI ST v. 1.1), patient refusal, and 
unacceptable toxicity  occurs; or the study  is prematurely  terminated by  [CONTACT_1034]; 
whichever comes first (see Section 6.4 Patient Withdrawal) .

appearance of new lesions. 
If radiologic imaging shows PD, tumor assessment should be repeated 4weeks later in 
order to confirm PD.  Study treatment may  continue according to the investigator’s discretion 
while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression.  I f repeat imaging shows a reduction 
in the tumor burden demonstrating CR, PR or SD compared to the initial scan, treatment may  
be con tinued/resumed.  In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or 
decreased, Investigators should consider all target lesions as well as non -target lesions 
(please refer to the Study Reference Manual). 
If the repeat imaging demonstrates con firmed evidence of PD, progressive disease, patients 
may be discontinued from the study .  However, according to the investigator’s clinical 
judgment and after discussion between the investigator and the Sponsor, if a patient with 
evidence of disease progression is still experiencing clinical benefit, the patient will be 
eligible for continued treatment with single agent axitinib, MK-3475 or axitinib combined 
with MK -3475.  The investigator’s judgment should be based on the overall benefit-risk 
assessment and the patient’s clinical condition, including performance status, clinical 
symptoms, adverse events and laboratory  data.  Patients may  receive study  treatment while 
waiting for confirmation of PD if they  are clinically stable as defined by  [CONTACT_54041]: 
Absence of clinical signs and sy mptoms (including worsening of laboratory  values) 
of disease progression. 
No decline in ECOG performance status. 
Absence of rapid progression of disease b y radiographic imaging. 
Absence of progressive tumor at cr itical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention. 
5.2.5. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product, b y the wrong patient, at the wron g time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .

5.2.6. Food Requirements
Axitinib can be taken with or without food.  MK- [ADDRESS_762720] to food.
5.2.7. Recommended Dose Modifications
Every  effort should be made to administer study  treatment on the planned dose and schedule.
In the event of significant toxicity  dosing may  be d elayed and/or reduced as described below.  
In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity  
observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify  Investigators at the first occurrence of any  
adverse s ymptom.
Dose modifications may  occur in three way s:
Within a cy cle (for axitinib only ): dosing interruption until adequate recovery , if 
required, during a given treatment cy cle.
Between cy cles (for MK -3475 only): next cy cle administration may  be delay ed due to 
persisting toxicity  when a new cy cle is due to start 
In the next cy cle (for axitinib only ): dose reduction may  be required in a subsequent 
cycle based on toxicity  experienced in the previous cy cle.
Investigators are encouraged to employ  best supportive care accordi ng to local institutional 
clinical practices and according to the guidance for selected adverse events provided below.
Dose modifications will be reported in the CRF.
Axitinib dose levels for intrapatient dose modification are listed in Table 4.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of Axitinib -Related Hypertension
Patients will be issued BP cuffs (provided b y the Sponsor) for home monitoring and 
instructed t o measure their BP twice daily , prior to taking each axitinib dose.  All BP 
measurements will be recorded in a diary  and brought to the nurse or study  coordinator at 
each clinic visit.  Patients should contact [CONTACT_580045] s ystolic BP ris es above 
150mm Hg, diastolic BP rises above 100 mm Hg, or if they  develop s ymptoms perceived to 
be related to elevated BP (eg, headache, visual disturbance).
To treat an increase in BP, standard antihy pertensives can be used (for example, thiazide or 
thiazide -like diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin converting -enzy me 
inhibitors, and dihy dropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers) although brad ycardic 
agents (such as beta adrenergic blockers with or without alpha- blocking properties, a nd 
non-DHP calcium channel blockers, clonidine, digoxin) should be avoided to the extent 
possible (see 
Section 5.4).47,48

[IP_ADDRESS]. MK-3475 Immune -Related Adverse Events
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may  represent an immunologic etiology . 
These immune -related AEs (irAEs) may  occur shortly  after the first dose or several months 
after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may  affect more than one body  system 
simultaneously . Therefore, earl y recognition and initiat ion of treatment is critical to reduce 
complications. Based on existing clinical study  data, most irAEs were reversible and could 
be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or 
other supportive care. For suspecte d irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology  
or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy , endoscopy , 
skin biopsy  may  be included as part of the evaluation.  Based on the severity of irAEs, 
withhold or permanentl y discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose 
modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab 
are provided in Table 6.  Additional guidance can be found in the Pembrolizu mab Events of

5.2.8. Compliance
An Investigational Product (I P) manual will be provided to the sites and will contain 
information about the drug supplies.  A patient diary  will be provided to the patients to aid in 
axitinib compliance.  The diary  will be maintained by  [CONTACT_580050].
Patients will be required to return all bottles of axitinib after eve ry cycle (every  21days).  
The number of axitinib tablets remaining will be documented and recorded at each clinic 
visit.  The patient diary  may  also be used to support this part of the axitinib accountabilit y 
process.
The site is to follow up (for example , via a telephone call) with each patient at Cy cle1 Day 5 
(+2days) to confirm that the patient understands and is in compliance with axitinib dosing 
instructions.  I f needed, the patient will be re- trained.  The same follow up process will be 
applied in case the dose of axitinib is modified during the treatment period.
5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
The Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required 
storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements. 

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 56Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with 
the labels.
Axitinib must be stored at controlled room temperature (between 15 -30C) or as 
specified on the label.
MK-
[ADDRESS_762735] be stored under storage conditions specified on the label. 
Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, I nvestigator Brochure) will be superseded by  
[CONTACT_580051]. 
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room
-temper ature products).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all nonwork ing day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in working order.
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery .  The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to the storage 
conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requir ements, including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007].
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until the [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be 
considered a protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational product after 
the temperature excursion.  Use of the investigational product prior to [COMPANY_007] approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation. 
Specific details regard ing information the site should report for each excursion will be 
provided to the site.  Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine 
handling operations where the products are briefl y out of the temperature range described in 
the labe ling are not considered excursions.   Site staff will instruct patients on the proper 
storage requirements for take home investigational products.
The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition 
of the investigational product supplies.  All investigational products will be 
accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record.  [COMPANY_007] may suppl y drug 
accountability  forms that must be used or may  approve use of standard institution forms.  I n 
eithe r case, the forms must identify  the investigational product, including batch or code 
numbers, and account for its disposition on a patient -by-patient basis, including specific dates 
and quantities.

needs to be verified and documented b y a second individual and the forms must be signed by 
[CONTACT_580052].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_407540]. 
All bottles of study  drug must be returned to the Investigator by  [CONTACT_102].  The sponsor or 
designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational product (eg, at 
the site).  If destruction is authorized to take place at the inve stigator site, the investigator 
must ensure that the materials are destro yed in compliance with applicable environmental 
regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  [CONTACT_4618], and all 
destruction must be adequately documented.
5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)
Concomitant treatment considered necessary for the patient’s well being may  be given at 
discretion of the treating phy sician.
Concomitant medications and treatments, including herbal supplements, will be recorded 
from [ADDRESS_762736] dose of study  
treatment.  All concomitant medications should be recorded in the CRF including supportive 
care drugs (eg, antiemetic treatment and prophy laxis), and the drugs used to treat ad
verse 
events or chronic diseases, and non drug supportive interventions (eg, transfusions).
Concurrent anticancer therapy with agents other than axitinib and MK -3475 is not allowed.  
Medications intended solely  for supportive care (ie, antiemetics, analgesics, megestrol 
acetate for anorexia) are allowed. 
5.4.1. Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP Enzymes (Axitinib)
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP enzy mes indicate that 
axitinib metabolism is primarily  mediated b y the CYP3A4/5, and to a lesser extent b y 
CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and UGT1A1. 
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithrom ycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromy cin, and voriconazole) should b e avoided.  Selection of an alternate concomitant 
medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended. Although 
axitinib dose adjustment has not been studied in patients receiving strong CYP3A4/5 
inhibitors, if a strong CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_762737] 
the axitinib area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) to the range observed 
without inhibitors.  The subsequent doses can be modified based on individual safet y and 
tolerability .  If co- administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the axitinib dose 
should be returned (after 3 
–5 half -lives of the inhibitor) to that used prior to initiation of the 
strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. 

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 58Co-administration of axitinib with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (eg, rifampin, dexamethasone, 
pheny toin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and St. John’s wort) should be 
avoided.  Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 induction 
potential is recommended.  Moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers (eg, bosentan, efavirenz, 
etravirine, modafinil, and nafcillin) may also reduce the plasma exposure of axitinib and 
should be avoided if possible.
5.4.2. Hemato poietic Growth Factors
Primary  prophy lactic use of granulocy te-colon y stimulating factors is not permitted during 
the first 6 weeks of treatment but they  may  be used to treat treatment emergent neutropenia 
as indicated b y the current American Societ y of Cl inical Oncology  (ASCO) guidelines.45
In subsequent cy cles, the use of hematopoietic growth factors is at the discretion of the 
treating phy sician in line with local guidelines.  Patients who enter the study  on stable doses 
of erythropoietin or darbepoietin may  continue this treatment, and patients may  start either 
drug during the study  at the discretion of the treating phy sician.
5.4.3. Concomitant Surgery 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib
No formal studies of the effect of axitinib on wound healing have bee n conducted, however 
caution is advised based on the mechanism of action.  If a major surgery  or an interventional 
procedure (eg, endoscopy) is required, treatment with axitinib must be interrupted at least 
24hours before the procedure and the patient BP should be monitored closely  for 
hypotension.  Patients may  resume axitinib seven day s after minor surgery  and 2 -3weeks 
after major surgery , provided that wound has completely  healed and there are no wound 
healing complications (eg, delay ed healing, wound infection or fistula).
[IP_ADDRESS]. MK-3475
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical/surgical events or logistical reasons 
not related to study  therapy  such as elective surgery , unrelated medical events, patient 
vacation and holiday s.  Patients should be placed back on stud y therap y within 3 weeks of 
the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the sponsor.  The reason for the 
interruption should be documented.
5.4.4. Concomitant Radiotherapy
Palliative radiotherap y to specific sites of disease is permitted if considered medically  
necessary  by [CONTACT_74079].  All attempts should be made to rule out disease 
progression in the event of increased localized pain.  If palliative radiotherapy  is needed to 
control bone pain the sites of bone di sease should be present at baseline, otherwise, it will be 
considered disease progression.

Page 595.4.5. Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited) 
Medications or vaccinations specificall y prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically  prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therap y or 
vaccination may  be required.  The investigator should discuss any  ques tions regarding this 
with the Sponsor Clinical Director.  The final decision on any  supportive therapy  or 
vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the patient’s primary  physician.  However, the 
decision to continue the patient on trial therap y or vac cination schedule requires the mutual 
agreement of the Investigator, the Sponsor, and the patient. 
5.4.6. Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retre atment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial: 
Anti- cancer s ystemic chemotherapy  or biological therapy . 
Immunotherap y not specified in this protocol. 
Chemotherap y not specified in this protocol. 
Investigational agents other than axitinib and MK-3475. 
Radiation therap y.

in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, 
mumps, rubella, chicken pox, y ellow fever, rabies, BCG, and ty phoid (oral) vaccine.   
Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally  killed virus vaccines and are allowed.  
However, intranasal influenza vaccines (e g,Flu -Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are 
not allowed.
Glucocorticoids for an y purpose other than to modulate sy mptoms from an event of clinical 
interest of suspected immunologic etiology .  The use of therapeutic doses of corticosteroids 
may be approved for s ymptomatic treatment after consultation with the S ponsor. 
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927] -Treatment Follow- up Phase. 
5.5.Rescue Medications & Supportive Care 
5.5.1. Supportive Care Guidelines 
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary b y the 
treating invest igator including but not limited to the items outlined below: 
Diarrhea: All patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrol ytes should be substituted via I V infusion. 

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 60Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressivel y, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cy cles to the administration of 
prophy lactic antiemetic therapy  according to standard institutional practice.   Patients 
should be strongly  encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake. 
Anti
-infectives: Patients with a documented infectious complication should receive 
oral or IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considered appropriate by  [CONTACT_110526] a given infectious condition, according to standard 
institutional practice. 
Anti- inflammatory  or narcotic analgesics may  be offered as needed.  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol to a MAXI MUM total daily  dose of 2 g is permitted.  
Daily  intake over 2 g is prohibited.
Patients who need to be on anticoagulant therap y during treatment should be treated 
with low molecular weight heparin.  If low dose heparin cannot be administered, the 
administration of coumadin or other coumarin derivatives or oth er anti -coagulants 
may be allowed; however appropriate monitoring of prothrombin time/I nternational 
normalized ratio (PT/I NR) should be performed.

6.1.Screenin g
For screening procedures see Schedule of Activities (SOA ) and ASSESSMENTS section 
(Section 7 ). 
6.1.1. Tumor Biospecimens
Provision of archival tumor biospecimens (all patients) and baseline de novo biospecimens 
from metastatic lesions (expansion cohort) is mandatory  for all patients.  Although baseline 
de novo biopsies taken from metastatic lesions prior to the date of screen ing are acceptable, 
sponsor provided neutral buffered formalin in kits for preferred collection on the date of 
screening to optimize tissue fixation for subsequent analy sis.  A second de novo biopsy  is 
strongly  encouraged and collected at the time of first tumor assessment at after 4 Cy cles of 
treatment (12 weeks).  It is recommended, if possible, that the 12 week biopsy  be taken from 
a lesion in the same anatomical location and also fixed in sponsor provided neutral buffered 
formalin. 
For archival tumor b iospecimens,   formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue block(s) 
from initial diagnosis that contain sufficient tissue to generate at least 12 slides, each with 
tissue 
sections (4 microns thickness preferred, 5 microns thick acceptable), will be coll ected.  
If no FFPE block is available, then at least 12 unbaked and unstained slides containing FFPE 
tissue sections, 5 microns thick acceptable).  However FFPE blocks are strongly  encouraged 
over slides.  See Section 7.3.1.  Additional information on tumor biospecimen collection, 
processing and immediate shippi[INVESTIGATOR_580020].

findings in baseline ECGs will be recorded as medical history .  Additional ECGs will be 
performed as clinicall y indicated.  Clinically  significant findings seen on the follow -up ECGs 
should be recorded as adverse events.
7.2.Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Plasma/serum samples will be obtained from patients for PK anal ysis of axitinib, MK -3475 
and anti -MK-3475- antibodies depending on the treatment cohort that they  belong to.  
Samples for MK -3475 PK and anti -MK-
3475- antibodies (ADA) will be collec ted from all 
patients in the study .  Axitinib PK samples will be collected from all patients in the Dose 
Finding Phase and at least 8 patients in the Dose Expansion Phase. 
7.2.1. Blood Sample Collection for Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Where noted in the Schedule of Activities (SOA ), blood samples will be collected at 
approximatel y the same time as other assessments wherever possible. 
The PK table indicates PK blood sampling time points for axitinib alone and axitinib in 
combination with MK-3475.  On the day s of axitinib PK sample collection, patients should 
be instructed to hold morning axitinib dosing until the pre dose sample has been drawn.  
Patients should have been taking axitinib u
ninterrupted for at least 3 days prior to each of the 
axitinib pharmacokinetic sample collection visits.  For all collections, the actual time of 
axitinib and MK -3475 dosing, as well as actual times of pharmacokinetic collections will be 
recorded in the so urce documents and CRF. 
Blood samples for axitinib PK, MK -3475 PK and anti -MK-3475 antibodies (ADA) will be 
collected as outlined in the Schedule for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collections table.
Pharmacokinetic samples for MK -3475 and anti -MK-3475 antibodies will also be collected 
at 1month, 3 months and 6 months after end of MK -3475 treatment. 
In addition to samples collected at the scheduled times, additional blood samples for axitinib 
and MK -3475 should be collected from patients experiencing unexpected and/or SAE’s and 
the date and time documented in the CRF.

A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 68All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled nominal time 
relative to dosing.  However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 
6minutes of a 60minute sample) will be considered protocol complaint, and the exact time 
of the sample collection noted on the CRF.  I f a scheduled blood sample collection cannot be 
completed for an y reason, the missed sample collection may  be rescheduled with agreemen t 
of clinical Investigators, patient and Sponsor.
PK samples will be assayed for axitinib, MK- 3475 and those for anti -MK-3475 antibodies 
using validated anal ytical methods.  Additional details regarding the collection, processing, 
storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] t he blood samples will be provided in the study  manual.  As part of 
the understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the study  drug, samples may  be used for 
potential qualitative and/or quantitative metabolite anal yses and/or evaluation of the 
bioanaly tical methods for axitinib, MK -3475 and anti -MK-3475 antibodies (ADA).  The 
results of such analy ses may  be included in the clinical report. 
7.2.2. Collection of Axitinib PK Samples
At each time point for axitinib, a 3 mL whole blood sample will be collected into an 
appropriatel y labeled K 3EDTA tube to provide a minimum of 1 mL plasma for 
pharmacokinetic anal ysis.
7.2.3. Processing, Storage and Shipment of Axitinib PK Samples
The following special precautions should be taken to minimize the rapid degradation of 
axitinib in plasm a when exposed to visible light:
Following collection of blood samples, samples should be processed as soon as 
possible.  Preferably, harvested plasma should be frozen within 1 hour of collection.
The blood collection tube should be gently  inverted (8 -10 times) to thoroughly  mix 
the blood with the anti- coagulant. 
Vacutainer tubes should be protected from light (covered completely  in aluminum 
foil or in black protection tubes) and placed in an ice
-bath while samples are waiting 
to be centrifuged to harvest plasma.
Following centrifugation (for at least 10 minutes at 1700 g at 4C or lower), plasma 
should be transferred rapi[INVESTIGATOR_522168] -20 C or lower. 
All samples should be transferred to an opaque box to protect from light ex posure 
during storage and shipment.  If a sample is inadvertently
 exposed to light (for 
5minutes or more), the sponsor should be notified so that the sample can be flagged 
for possibly  spurious results.
Once frozen, samples should not be allowed to thaw, including during shipment.

7.2.4. Colle ction and processing of MK -3475 PK Samples
At each time point 3 -mL of blood will be collected into a 3.5 mL Serum Separator Tube 
(SST) at the designated times.  The tube should be inverted 5-6 times without shaking.  After 
collection, sample should be left standing upright at room temperature for 30 minutes but no 
more than 60 minutes to coagulate.  Centrifuge at 1100 to 1300 x g at room temperature for 
15 minutes until clot and serum are separated.  Serum should be aliquoted into 2 new tubes: 
Corning 2- mL polyprop ylene cryovials.  Serum samples must be frozen within 30 minutes of 
collection at –70C or colder (alternativel y –20C is acceptable for up to 1 month) and 
maintained in the frozen state until assay ed.
7.2.5. Collection and 
Processing of A nti-MK-3475 Anti body Samples
At each time point 6 -mL of blood will be collected into a Serum Separator Tube (SST) at the 
designated times.  Allow blood to remain upright at room temp for at least [ADDRESS_762750] be frozen within 30 min of collection at -70C or colder (alternativel y - 20C is 
acceptable for up to 1 month) and maintained in the frozen state until assayed.
7.3.Translational and Pharmacodynamic Assessments
A key  objective of the biomarker anal yses that will be performed in this study  is to 
investigate candidate biomarkers that may  have predictive value in identifying those patient s 
who may  benefit from treatment with MK -
3475 when used in combination with a VEGF 
inhibitor.  I n addition, analy ses of sequentiall y obtained tissue and blood biomarkers will 
provide an opportunit y to investigate pharmacod ynamic effects.  Samples collected at the 
End of Treatment visit will also help understand potential mechanisms of resistance to the 
drug combination.
7.3.1. Archived Tumor Biospecimens and De Novo Tumor Biopsies
Tumor biospecimens from archived tissue samples and metastatic lesions (see Section 6.1.1) 
will be used to anal yze candidate DNA, RNA or protein markers, or relevant signature [CONTACT_580060]
y to predict or identify those patients who are most likely to benefit 
from treatment with the study  drugs.  Markers that may  be anal yzed include, but may  not be 
limited to drug targets such as PD- L1.  Studies will investigate whether potential predictive 
markers represent intrinsic or acquired mechanisms of resistance.  Onl y core biopsies are 
suitable.  Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_19328].  Additional information on tissue

Page 707.3.2. Peripheral Blood
Blood biospecimens (10 mL) for serum and whole blood will be obtained from all enrolled 
patients to measure DNA, RNA, or proteins known or suspected to be of relevance to the 
mechanism of action, the development of resistance, or the identification of those patients 
who might benefit from treatment with axitinib and MK-3475 combination.  Markers that 
may be anal yzed include, but may  not be limited to VEGF -A, VEGFR2, IL8 and T -cell 
receptors.  Biospecimens should be obtained pre- dose (see Schedule of Activities ).
7.4.Banked Biospecimens
7.4.1. Markers of Drug Re sponse
Banked biospecimens will be collected from patients for exploratory  research relating to the 
drug response and disease/condition under study .  These collections are not ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y 
associated with a planned assessment described in the protocol .
They  will be handled in a manner that protects each patient’s privacy  and confidentiality .  
Banked biospecimens will be assigned the patient’s study  identification code (ID) at the site.  
The data generated from these banked biospecimens will also be indexed by [CONTACT_168084].  
Biospecimens will be kept until destruction in facilities with access limited to authorized 
personnel, and biospecimen -derived data will be stored on password -protected computer 
systems.  The key  between the patient’s ID and the patient’s direct personally  identify ing 
information (eg, name, address) will be held at the study site.  Biospecimens will be used 
only for the purposes described in the protocol and the informed consent document/patient 
information sheet; an y other uses require additiona l ethical approval.  Unless a time 
limitation is required by  [CONTACT_240846], biospecimens will be 
stored for man y years (no time limit) to allow for research in the future, including research 
conducted during the lengthy  drug development process and also post -marketing research.  
Patients may  withdraw their consent for the use of their banked biospecimens at any  time by  
[CONTACT_7328] a request to the Investigator; in this case, any  remaining biospecimen will be 
destroy ed, but data alread y generated from the biospecimens will continue to be available to 
protect the integrit y of existing analyses.  Unless prohibited by [CONTACT_168038], a 4mL blood genomic banked biospecimen Prep D1
(dipotassium edetic acid [e thylenediaminetetraacetic acid] [K2EDTA] whole blood 
collection optimized for DNA anal ysis) will be collected at the time specified in the Schedule 
of Activities section of the protocol to be retained for potential pharmacogenomic /biomarker 
analyses related to drug responseand disease under study .  For example, putative safet y 
biomarkers, drug metabolizing enzy me genes, drug transport protein genes, or genes thought 
to be related to the mechanism of drug action may be examined.   The primary  purpose is to 
examine DNA; however, the biospecimen may  also be used to study  other molecules 
(eg,RNA, proteins, and metabolites).
The Banked Biospecimens will be collected from all patients unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_168085]/EC decis ion.

Page 71It is possible that the use of these biospecimens may result in commercially viable products.  
Patients will be advised in the informed consent document/patient information sheet that they  
will not be compensated in this event.
7.4.2. Additional Research
Unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_168086]/EC decision, patients will be asked to indicate 
on the consent form whether they will allow the Banked Biospecimens to also be used to 
design and conduct research in order to gain a further understanding of other diseases and to 
advance science, including development of other medicines for patients.
Patients need not provide additional biospecimens for the uses described in this section; the 
biospecimen specified in Markers of Drug Re sponse Section will be used.  Patients may  still 
participate in the clinical trial if they  elect not to allow their Banked Biospecimens to be used 
for the additional purposes described in this section.
7.5.Tumor Response Assessments
Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  Imaging may  include 
chest, abdomen and pelvis CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; brain CT or MRI  
scan at baseline and when suspected brain metastases.  The CT scans should be performed 
with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons. 
The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline will be emplo yed in the following tumor assessments.
Antitumor activity  will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at 
baseline (screening), at 12 weeks, and every  6weeks thereafter. In addition, radiological 
tumor assessments will also be conducted whenever disease progression is suspected 
(eg,symptomatic deterioration) and at the time of withdrawal from the treatment (if not done 
in the previous 6 weeks).  See Schedule of Activities (SOA ) and Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for 
treatment after initial evidence of disease progression.
Bone scan (bone scintigraphy ) or 18F-FDG -PET/CT is required at baseline then every  
12weeks onl y if bone metastases are present at baseline.  Otherwise bone imaging is 
required onl y if new bone metastases are suspected .  Bone imaging is also required at the 
time of confirmation of response for patients who have bone metastases. 
Measurable or evaluable lesions that have been previously  irradiated will not be considered 
target lesions unless increase in size has been obs erved following completion of radiation 
therap y.
Assessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 ( Appendix 2).
All patients’ files and radiologic images must be available for source verification and for 
potential peer review.

8.1.Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety  events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 ty pes of events: (1) SAEs; 
(2)non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under 
study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.

occupational exposure 
(regardless of whether 
associated with an AE)
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_762752] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the Investigator must pursue and obtain adequate info rmation both to 
determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification 
as an SAE (see the Serious Adverse Events section below) requiring immediate notification 
to [COMPANY_007] or its designated r epresentative.  In addition, the investigator may  be requested by  
[CONTACT_306912] -up information in an expedited fashion.  This 
information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this will include a 

AG-013736, MK -[ADDRESS_762753] SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF , laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as an SAE.  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the Investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study . 
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
Allevents detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investi gator is to record on the CRF all directly
 observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y patient/ legally acceptable representative.  In addition, each stud y 
patient/ legally  acceptable representative will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a 
non-leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Patient 
Withdrawal section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definitio n of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. 
When a patient withdraws from the study  because of a SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.
8.1.4.
Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each patient begins from the time the patient provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the patient’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a 
minimum of 90calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product.

SAEs occurring in a patient after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the in vestigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, SAEs occurring during the above 
indicated active collection period must still be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y irrespective of 
any intervening treatment.

treatment with MK -
3475 , or within 28 days after the cessation of study  treatment if the 
patient begins a new anticancer therap y, whichever is earlier, should be reported as in 
Section 8.4 (Exposure During Pregnancy ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow up by  [CONTACT_47610] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the recording period fo r non serious AEs ends at 
the time the new treatment is started; however, SAEs must continue to be recorded on the 
CRF during the above indicated active collection period.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non 
serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determinatio n of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 75defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse rea ctions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study patient administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relati onship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;

Page 76Medication error;
Occupational exposure .
Worsening of signs a nd sy mptoms of the malignancy  under study  should be reported as AEs 
in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed b y measurement of 
malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be reported as AEs.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing outside of protocol- stipulated dose 
adjustments or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the Investigator or Sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect .
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 77Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determinin g whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and sy mptoms of progression) 
should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the safety  reporting 
period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580021].  If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome during the study or within the 
safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an A E on the 
CRF, and as an SAE with CTCAE Grade 5 (see the section on Severit y Assessment ).
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47575] y initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8843].  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, neurological f loor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessaril y constitute an 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed 
for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
work -up of persistent pre-treatment laboratory  abnormality );

Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentatio n for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medi cal condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should b
e recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment

Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria 
for SAEs, listed above.

Page 798.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Potential Cases of Drug-I nduced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some patients, transamin ase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These patients fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Patients who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal (× ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alan ine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 × ULN) b y several 
days or weeks.  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the s ame lab sample).  
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been excluded.
The threshold of laborator y abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the patient’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Patients who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to def initivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Patients with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For patients with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN 
(whichever is smaller).

AG-013736, MK -[ADDRESS_762754]/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  rema ins as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.
The patient should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_762755] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma glu tamy l 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of etha nol, acetaminophen (either by  
[CONTACT_20025] a coformulated product in prescription or over the counter medications), 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundi ced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg,biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  S uch potential DILI (Hy
’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability  of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology  of the L FT abnormalities. 
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.2. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuation and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product. 

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 81An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male patient has been exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) to 
the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy . 
If a patient or patient’s p artner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study  patient’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this information to 
the [COMPANY_007] Safety  on a CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information r elated 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  outcome and its
information for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The Investigator will follow the 
pregnancy  until completion (or until pregn ancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the 
outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the 
structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a 
termination, the r eason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the 
structural integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection 
(unless pre -procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the fin dings 
are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine feta l demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abo rtion.
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_762756].

Page 82Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  patient with the EDP Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source 
documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to 
provide to his partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to Pfize r Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences a SAE associated with such a 
drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the perfor mance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the [COMPANY_007] Safety  unit within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study , the 
information is not reported on a CRF, however, a copy  ofthe completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.3. Medication Errors
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

or do not involve the participating patient.
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if 
applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the 
CRF. 
Medication errors should be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within [ADDRESS_762757] SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an SAE .
9.DATA ANALYSIS/STA TISTICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by [CONTACT_4618].  
This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment.
9.1.Analysis Sets 
The following patient sets will be assessed.
Safety  anal ysis set.
The safet y analysis set includes all enr olled patients who receive at least one dose of axitinib 
or MK -3475.
Per protocol anal ysis set (evaluable for DLT).
All enrolled patients who are eligible, receive at least one dose of axitinib and MK -3475, and 
who either experience DLT during the first tw o cycles, or complete the observation period 
for the first two cycles of treatment (6 weeks).  Patients who withdraw from study treatment 
before receiving at least 75% of the planned first two cy cles doses of axitinib or two 
infusions of MK- 3475 within the DLT observation period due to reasons other than treatment 
related adverse events are not evaluable for DLT. A patient who is unable to start at the 
assigned Cy cle1 Day 1 dose level after the lead -in period will not be evaluable for DLTs but 
will be eva luated for safety  and efficacy .

Page 84Response evaluable analy sisset. 
All patients who receive study  treatment with an adequate baseline tumor assessment will be 
considered evaluable for anti- tumor efficacy  using standard RECI ST1.1 criteria. 
PK analy sis set.
The PK concentration population is defined as all treated patients who have at least 
1concentration of either of the study  drugs. 
The PK parameter anal ysis population is defined as all treated patients who have at least 1 of 
the PK parameters of interes t of an y of the study drugs. 
Biomarker anal ysis set.
The biomarker anal ysis set is defined as all treated patients who have at least one screening 
biomarker assessment, and have received at least one dose of an y stud y drug.  Analysis sets 
will be defined separately  for blood -based and tumor tissue -based biomarkers.
If mutational profiling is performed on samples derived from the biomarker anal ysis set, the 
analysis may  be limited to screening samples onl y.
9.2.Statistical Methods and Properties
9.2.1. Statistical Met hods for Dose Escalation/De -
Escalation: mTPI
[INVESTIGATOR_522172] 3+3 design for Phase 1 dose 
escalation trials that improve accuracy , efficiency  and statistical validity . 
The modified toxicity  probability  interval ( mTPI) design23uses a Bay esian statistics 
framework and a beta/binomial hierarchical model to compute the posterior probability  of 
three dosing intervals that reflect the relative difference between the toxicity rate of each 
dose level to the target rate (pT = 0.30).  If the toxicity  rate of the currentl y used dose level is 
far smaller than pT, the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_134922]; if it is close to pT, 
the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_580022]; if it is far greater than pT, the mTPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_128598] -escalating the dose level.  These rules are conceptuall y similar to those 
used by  [CONTACT_941] 3+3 design, except the decisions of an mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_580023] a coherent probability  model. 
Being a model -based design, mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_580024] y and appropriatel y tailors dose -escalation 
and de -escalation decisions for different trials with different toxicit y parameters.  More 
importantly , all the dose- escalation/ de -escalation decisions for a given trial can be 
pre-calculated under the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_580025] a two- way table ( Table 2).  Thus, 
compared to other advanced model -based designs published in the literature, the mTPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_580026].  Recently , a Phase I trial 
based on the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_274159].23

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 85Decision rules are based on calculating unit probability mass (UPM) of three dosing intervals 
corresponding to under, proper, and over dosing in terms of toxicity .  Specifically , the 
underdosing interval is defined as (0; pT -e1), the over -dosing interval (pT+e 2), and the 
proper -dosing interval (pT - e1, pT+ e 2), where e 1and e 2are small fra ctions.  Based on the 
safet y profile of axitinib and MK -3475, e 1 is selected as 0.05, and e 2is selected as 0.03.  
Therefore, the target dosing interval for the DLT rate is (0.25, 0.33).
The three dosing intervals are associated with three different dose -
escalation decisions.  The 
under -dosing interval corresponds to a dose escalation (E), over- dosing corresponds to a dose 
de-escalation (D), and proper -dosing corresponds to stay ing at the current dose (S).  Given a 
dosing interval and a probability  distribu tion, the unit probability  mass (UPM) of that dosing 
interval is defined as the probability of a patient belonging to that dosing interval divided by  
[CONTACT_274217].  The mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_580027], and the one with the largest UPM informs the corresponding dose -escalation 
decision, which is the dose level to be used for future patients.  For example, if the 
under -dosing interval has the largest UPM, the decision will be to escalate, and the next 
cohort of patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.  Ji and collaborators23have 
demonstrated that the decision based on UPM is optimal in that it minimizes a posterior 
expected loss (ie, minimizes the c hance of making a wrong dosing decision). 
The dose -finding component of the trial is completed when at least [ADDRESS_762758] dose associated with a DLT rate <0.33.  I t is 
estimated that approximately  20DLT -evalu able patients will need to be enrolled to reach 
10DLT-evaluable patients at the estimated MTD. 
9.2.2. Statistical Method for Estimating the MTD
As described in Section 3.2, the estimated MTD will be the highest tested dose level with a 
DLT rate <0.33 in 10 DLT evaluable patients.  We assume that higher doses of MK-3475 
result in higher toxicity  rates.  But, due to the relatively  low number of patients that may  be 
potentially  allocated to any  dose com bination, this assumption may  be violated.  For 
example, at the end of the study , the dose combination (MK -
3475 2 mg /kg q3wks, axitinib 
5mgBID) may  have a higher proportion of observed toxicities than, say , (MK -3475 1 mg 
/kg q3wks, axitinib 5 mgBID), a nd this variability may  be simply  related to small cohort size 
alone.  To overcome this potential problem, we use a bivariate isotonic regression to smooth 
the resulting toxicity  surface to a monotonically  increasing one.  The determination of the 
MTD cont our is accomplished using the Dy kstra -Roberston algorithm.24  Once a 
monotonically  increasing toxicity  surface is obtained (either observed or smoothed according 
to the bivariate isotonic regression algorithm), the MTD combinations closest to the targeted 
DLT rate of 0.3 but still <0.[ADDRESS_762759] a reliable and accurate estimate of the MTD.  I n addition, there will be a Dose 
Expansion Phase coho rt to characterize safet y, biomarkers, and efficacy in terms of 
probability  (p) of achieving an event of interest including, but not limited to, objective 
response (OR).  The goal will be to estimate proportions of such patients with the standard 
error ( SE) of not greater than 0.08, ie, b y definition,
n np pSE
21 ) 1 (
Therefore, a sample of forty  patients ( n=40 ) in the Dose Expansion Phase cohort will allow 
estimation of the probability  of achieving an event of interest with the standard error 0.08.  
The sample size estimate for the expansion cohort also takes into consideration the key  tumor 
biomarker PD -L1 endpoints.  I f the observed rate of PD -L1 positives is 20% then 
approximatel y 40 patients would be required to enroll 8 PD-L1 positive patients.
9.4.Efficacy Analysis 
Inthis study , anti -tumor activity  is a secondary  objective.  Efficacy  anal yses will be 
presented in the form of statistical summaries and data listings for the Dose Expansion Phase 
cohort.  For the Dose Finding cohorts only  data listings for BOR will be pre sented.
9.4.1. Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints (Dose Expansion Phase Cohort)
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed 
complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECI ST version 1.[ADDRESS_762760] 4 weeks after initial documentation or 
response.  Otherwise, the patient will be counted as a non-responder in the asses sment of 
ORR.
Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time from first dose of study  treatment to the first 
documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that is subsequently  confirmed.
Duration of Response (DR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective 
tumor response (CR or PR) that is subsequently  confirmed to the first documentation of 
objective tumor progression or to death due to an y cause, whichever occurs first. 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time fro m the first dose of study  treatment 
to the first progression of disease (PD) or death for an y reason in the absence of documented 
PD.  PFS will be summarized in the response evaluable population.  PFS data will be 
censored on the date of the last tumor ass essment on study  for patients who do not have 
objective tumor progression and who do not die within [ADDRESS_762761] tumor assessment prior to the start of the new therap y.
Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the first dose of study  treatment to the date 
of death due to an y cause.   OS will be summarized in the response evaluable population.  For 
patients still alive at the time of the anal ysis, the OS time will be censored on the last date 
they were known to be alive.  Patients lacking data bey ond the day  of first dose of study  
treatment will have their survival times censored at 1 day.
Summaries will include: ORR, TTR, DR, PFS and OS.  Time -to event endpoints (TTR, DR 
PFS and OS) will be analy sed with Kaplan
-Meier method.  Point estimates will be presented 
with th eir 95% confidence intervals.  In addition, progression date, death date, date of first 
response and last tumor assessment date will be listed, together with best overall response 
(BOR), TTR, DR, PFS and OS.
9.5.Analysis of Other Endpoints
9.5.1. Analysis of Pharmacokinetics
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Analysis of MK -[ADDRESS_762762] PK parameters will include Cmax, Tmax, 
AUC 0-12, oral plasma clearance (CL/F), and apparent volume of distribution (V z/F) 
Descriptive statistics for the PK parameters for axitinib will be provided by [CONTACT_2715], cy cle and 
day of assessment in tabular form.  For MK -3475, pharmacokinetics will be evaluated using 
population pharmacokinetic modeling.
All plasma/serum concentrations will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, SD, CV, 
median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean, its associated CV, and 95% confidence 
interval) b y dose, cycle, day and nominal time.  Individual patient and median profiles of the 
concentration -time data will be plotted by  [CONTACT_2715], cy cle and day  (single dose and steady -state) 
using nominal times.  Median profiles will be prese nted on both linear -linear and log- linear 
scales.
Trough concentrations for MK-3475 will be plotted for each dose using a box- whisker plot 
by [CONTACT_407599] -state.
In addition, Non
-linear Mixed Effects Modeling (NONMEM) approaches will be explored to 
further describe the pharmacokinetic profile and assess potential drug interaction for 
MK-3475.

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Effect of MK-[ADDRESS_762763] of repeated MK-3475 dosing on axitinib PK will be evaluated based on changes in 
AUC 0-12of axitinib on Lead -in Day 7 and C ycle 7 Day 1, respectivel y, as the primary 
pharmacokinetic parameter.  The associated 90% confidence interval will also be computed 
to assess the magnitude of the effect.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenecity Assessment
Results for the anti- MK-3475 antibody  (ADA) assessment will be provided.  The effect of 
ADA on MK -3475 concentration will be evaluated.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis or PK/PD Modeling
MK-3475 disposition will be evaluated using a population PK model for the drug.  The 
results of this analy sis, if performed, will be reported separatel y.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Analysis of Biomarker Endpoints
Biomarkers will be assessed separatel y for blood and tumor tissue biospecimens.  I n each 
case, summaries of baseline levels and changes from baseline will be reported.  Summary  
statistics may  include the mean and standard deviation, median, and minimum/maximum 
levels of biomarker measures or frequency  statistics, as appropriate. 
Data from biomarker assay s will be anal yzed usi ng graphical methods and descriptive 
statistics such as linear regression, t- test, and anal ysis of variance (ANOVA).  The statistical 
approach may  examine correlations of biomarker results with pharmacokinetic parameters 
and measures of anti- tumor efficacy .
Due to the exploratory  nature of the proposed biomarkers, the data analysis will be conducted 
with the goal of identify ing biomarkers with the strongest concordance to clinical outcome, 
encompassing both safety and efficacy .  Candidate biomarkers will be validated in 
subsequent trials.
9.6.Safety Analysis
Summaries and anal yses of the primary  safet y endpoint will be based on the per protocol 
analysis set.  All other summaries and analyses of safet y parameters will include all patients 
in the Safety  Anal ysis Set.  Safety  data will be summarized by  [CONTACT_580053].  Safety  data collected during 
the lead-in PK period will be reported separatel y.  The anal ysis of safet y will extend through 
90days after the last administration of study  drug.
9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Safety Endpoint
Dose L imiting Toxicity  (DL Ts) is the primary  endpoint of the Dose Finding Phase of the 
study .  The occurrence of DL Ts observed in the Dose Finding Phase is used to estimate the 
MTD (if reached) as described in Section 3.2.  Adverse Events constituting DL Ts will be 
listed per cohort.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events
Adverse Events (AEs) will be graded b y the Investigator according to the Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03 and coded using the 
Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).  The focus of AE summaries will 
be on Treatment Emergen t Adverse Events, those with initial onset or increasing in severity 
after the first dose of study  medication.  The number and percentage of patients who 
experienced an y AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE, and treatment related SAE
will be summariz ed according to worst toxicity  grades.  The summaries will present AEs 
both on the entire study  period and by  [CONTACT_5265] (C ycle1 and C ycles beyond 1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities
The number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory  test abnorma lities will be 
summarized according to worst toxicity  grade observed for each lab assay .  The anal yses will 
summarize laboratory  tests both on the entire study  period and by  [CONTACT_5265] (Cy cle1 and 
Cyclesbeyond1).  Shift tables will be provided to examine the distribution of laboratory  
toxicities.
For laboratory  tests without NCI  CTCAE grade definitions, results will be categorized as 
normal, abnormal or not done. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. ECG
All ECGs obtained during the study  will be evaluated for safet y.  Single ECG measurement 
will be obtained at screening and on Cy cle1 Day 1 and End of Treatment/Withdrawal.  
Additionally , ECGs should be performed when clinically  indicated. 
9.6.3. Concomitant Medications/Follow- up Systemic Therapy 
All medications received during the treatment period wi ll be considered as concomitant 
medications and will be coded by  [CONTACT_128681] .  Patients who received 
concomitant medications will be listed.  Follow -up sy stemic therapy  for the primary  
diagnosis will be summarized by  [CONTACT_128682] -up ther apy and will be listed for each 
patient as appropriate.
9.7.Data Monitoring Committee
This study  will not use a data monitoring committee (DMC).  For the purpose of this 
protocol, [COMPANY_007] procedures for periodic safety  review will be applied by  [CONTACT_580054] y and clinical databases.  Procedures include:

findings satisfy ing the DLT criteria will be discussed in an on- going manner. 
Findings having immediate implication for the management of patie nts on study  will 
be communicated to all Principal Investigators in the timeframe associated with 
unexpected and drug -related SAEs.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study  conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The 
Investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its age nts and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  completion, the investigator site may  be subject to
review b y the IRB/ EC, and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or companies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be pres ent during the inspection.  The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the patient's medical records.  The investigator will promptly  provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the Investigator(s) a nd their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .

AG-013736, MK -[ADDRESS_762764] parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The Investigator has ultim ate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator or by  [CONTACT_522209].  Any  corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's patient chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all par ticipating patients 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and ad equate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the Investigator according to ICH guidelines, according to local regulations, or as 
specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.
If the Investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferre d to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
Investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_762765] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.

AG-013736, MK -[ADDRESS_762766]/Ethics Committee 
It is the re sponsibility  of the I nvestigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the
IRB/EC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In 
that event, the Investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirement s, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration o f Helsinki (World 
Medical Association 1996 & 2008). 
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I CH guideline 
on GCP, and applicable local regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Patient Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosures, except where 
required b y laws. 
When study  data are compi[INVESTIGATOR_580028] d parties, patient 
names, address, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y a numerical code based on a 
numbering sy stem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  the study  patients.  The 
investigator site will maintain a confidential list of patie nts who participated in the study , 
linking each patient’s numerical code to his or her actual identity .  In case of data transfer, 
[COMPANY_007] will maintain high standards of confidentiality  and protection of patient’s personal data 
consistent with applicable p rivacy  laws.
The informed consent document(s ) and any  patient recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements, including 
applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent document(s) used during the informed consent process and an y patient 
recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_4618], approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/IEC 
before use, and available for inspection . 

AG-013736, MK -[ADDRESS_762767] ensure that each study  patient, or his/her legal representat ive, is fully  
informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with 
participation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from a patient’s legally  acceptable representative, the patient’s 
assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the 
capacity  to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  If the investigator determines that 
a patient’s decisional capacity  is so limited he or she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, then, as 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, the 
patient’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y patient does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents 
must rec ord wh y the patient did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), 
how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient’s legall y 
acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study  patient (eg, parent, 
spouse), and that the patient’s assent was obtained or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y, 
it must be documented in the source documents.
The Investigator, or a person designated by  [CONTACT_737], will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient or the patient's legal representative before an y study -specific 
activity  is performed.  The Investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed 
consent document.
12.4. Patient Recruitment
Advertisements approved by  [CONTACT_580055] I nvestigator databases may  be used as 
recruitment procedures.
12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
regulatory  authori ty in any  area of the world, or if the I nvestigator is aware of any  new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the Investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately of an y urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the Investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the I nvestigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study  as stated in the 
regulatory  application (ie, Cli nical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the 
Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) b y 
a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal 
conclusion to the study  in that Member State.

[ADDRESS_762778] criteria as described below.
Measurable:
Tumor lesion : Must be accurately  measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10mm by  [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5mm);
10mm caliper measurement by  [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accuratel y 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable).
Malignant ly mph nodes : To be considered pathologically  enlarged and measurable, a l ymph 
node must be 15mm in short axis when assessed by  [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only  the short axis 
will be measured and followed.
Non-Measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest d iameter <10mm or 
pathological ly mph nodes with  10mm to <15 mmshort axis) as well as truly  
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered trul y non-measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast di sease, ly mphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegal y identified by
[CONTACT_522214] b y reproducible imaging techniques. 
NOTE: If measurable disease is restricted to a solitary  lesion, its neoplastic nature should be 
confirmed b y cytology /histology .
Recording Tumor Measurements
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and measured and 
recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameters) and their suitability  for 
accurate repetitive measurements (either b y imaging techniq ues or clinically ). 
The longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion.  The sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum longest 
diameter to be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the 
measurable dimension of the disease during treatment.  All measurements should be 
performed using a caliper or ruler and should be recorded in metric notation in centimeters.

A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 102All other lesions (or sites of disease) shoul d be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be 
followed as “present” or “absent.”
Techniques for Assessing Measurable Disease
The same method of assessment and the s ame technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at screening and during follow -up.  I maging -based evaluation 
is preferred to evaluation by  [CONTACT_2085] (phy sical) examination when both methods have been 
used to assess the antit umor effect of a treatment.
Definitions of Tumor Response
Target Lesions
Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions.  Any
pathological ly mph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to
<10mm.
Partial response (PR) is defined as a  30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of 
the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as a  20% increase in the sum of the longest dime nsions 
of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions 
recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  I n 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate anabsolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.
Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify  for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions 
since the treatment started. 
Non- Target Lesions
Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all non -target lesions.  All
lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis) .
Non-CR/Non -PDis defined as a persistence of 1 non- target lesions.
Progressive disea
se (PD) is defined as unequivocal progression of existing non -target 
lesions, or the appearance of [ADDRESS_762779] be confirmed b y repeat studies that should be performed 4weeks 
after the criteria for response are first met.  In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must 
have met the SD criteria at least once after stud y entry  at a minimum interval of 12weeks.
Determination of Tumor Response by [CONTACT_522215] -target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded 
separately .  Determination of tumor response at each assessment is summarized in the 
following ta ble.

[ADDRESS_762780] response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  For CR and PR, t he patient’s best 
respons e assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria.  In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least 
once after stud y entr y at a mi nimum interval of 12 weeks.
NOTE: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every  effort s hould be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  It should also be noted that a tumor 
marker increase does not constitute adequate objective evidence of tumor progression.  
However, such a tumor marker increase should prompt a repeat radiographic evaluation to 
document whether or not objective tumor progression has occurred. 
In some circumstances, it may  be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of complete response de pends upon this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by  [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_522180].

Page 110Footnotes for Schedule of Activities
1. During Treatment: All assessments should be performed prior to dosing with study treatment unless otherwise 
indicated.  Acceptable time windows for performing each assessmen t are described in the column headings.   
Patients who permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and continue on axitinib treatment, it is at the discretion of 
the investigator to follow patients on axitinib monotherapy every 3 weeks + or –3 days (ie, cycle= 21 days) or 
6weeks + or –3 days (ie, cycle=42 days). All tests and assessments outlined in the schedule of activities must be 
conducted at that visit. 
2. End of Study Treatment/Withdrawal: Obtain these assessments if not completed during the previous two weeks 
on study.
3. Physical Examination: Includes an examination of major body systems and weight.  
4. In Clinic Blood pressure, pulse rate: Blood pressure, and pulse rate should be taken with the patient in the seated 
position after the patient has been sit ting quietly for at least [ADDRESS_762788] 1 hour apart at each clinic visit.
5. Home blood pressure monitoring: All patients will receive home blood pressure monitoring devices and blood 
pressure will be monitored at home.  While on axitinib (as single agent or combined with MK 3475) patients will 
monitor their blood pressure at least twice daily (before taking each dose of axitinib) and blood pressure should 
be recorded in a patient diary.  Patients should be in structed to contact [CONTACT_580058] 150 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure rises above 100 mm Hg, or if they 
develop symptoms perceived to be related to elevated blood pressure (eg, headache, visu al disturbance) although 
a different blood pressure threshold for contact[CONTACT_580059]’s clinical 
judgment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
6. Hematology, Blood Ch emistry, and Coagulation: Required tests are listed in Table 8.  All laboratory tests may be 
performed per standard of care and when clinically indicated.   Dose adjustment may be required (see 
Section 5.2.7 ).
7. If protein 2+ by [CONTACT_522188] (eg, urine dipstick), protein will have to be quantified by 24 hour urine 
collection.  Dose adjustment may be required (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  May be performed also when clinically 
indicated.
8. Single ECG measurement will be obtained at End of Treatment/Withdrawal. Additionally, ECGs should be 
performed when clinically indicated.  Clinically si gnificant findings seen on follow -up ECGs should be recorded 
as adverse events.
9. Subsequently, TSH should be assessed every [ADDRESS_762789]
25mIU/mL, will be performed and routinely repeated at every cycle during the active treatment period, at the end 
of study treatment and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is 
otherwise suspected.  Pregnancy tes ts may also be repeated as per request of IRB/IECs or if required by [CONTACT_13125] (see Section 7.1.1 ).  
11. Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites: frequency to be performed per local 
standard of care and again at treatment withdrawal if not performed within previous [ADDRESS_762790] version 1.1 tumor assessment criteria to determine disease progression.  
12. Adverse Events: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using NCI CTCAE 
version 4.03.  For SAEs, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from the time 
that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained p rior to the patient’s participation in the study, 
ie,prior to undergoing any study related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and 
including [ADDRESS_762791] MK -3475.  SAEs experienced by a patient after the active reporting period (see 
Section8.1.4 ) has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the Investigator becomes aware of them; at a 
minimum, all SAEs that the Investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study 
drug are to be reported to the Sponsor.  AEs (serious and non serious) should be recorded on the Case Report 
Form (CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least one dose of study treatment through last patient visit 
(Day [ADDRESS_762792] dose).  If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non serious 
AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Pregnancy or breast feeding that occur during the trial, within 
120days of discontinuing treatment with MK -3475, or wit hin 28 days after the cessation of axitinib if the patient 
begins a new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, should be reported as in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Exposure During 

AG-013736, MK -3475
A4061079
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 03April 2018 
Page 111Pregnancy).
13. Concomi tant medications and treatments will be recorded from [ADDRESS_762793] dose of study treatment.  All concomitant medications should be recorded in the CRF 
including supportive care drugs (eg, an ti emetic treatment and prophylaxis), and the drugs used to treat adverse 
events or chronic diseases, and non -drug supportive interventions (eg, transfusions).
14. Study treatment: will be administered as in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 Axitinib will be given orally twice daily PO on a 
continuous schedule.  MK -3475 will be given as a 30 minute intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.  (one 
Cycle= 3weeks) (see Section 5).  Patients with disease progression who are continuing to derive clinical benefits 
from the study treatment may continue treatment with axitinib provided that the treating physician has determined 
thatthe benefit/risk for doing so is favorable and after discussion with the sponsor.  Continuation of treatment 
with MK -3475 beyond 24 months should be discussed with the sponsor and not go beyond 36 months. Patients 
who permanently discontinue pembrolizuma b and continue on axitinib treatment, it is at the discretion of the 
investigator to follow the patient on axitinib monotherapy every 3 weeks + or – 3days (ie, cycle=21 days) or 
6weeks + or – 3days (ie, cycle=42 days).  All tests and assessments outlined in Appendix 6Schedule of 
Activities must be conducted at that visit or when clinically indicated.  Patients on axitinib monotherapy have the 
opportunity to continue axitinib treatment on a [COMPANY_007] -sponsored program at the time of the discontinuation of 
survival status follow -up. 
15. Survival: All patients should be followed for survival at least every [ADDRESS_762794] patient ha s been enrolled.  Information on 
antineoplastic treatments (ie, systemic, surgery, and radiotherapy) will be collected.

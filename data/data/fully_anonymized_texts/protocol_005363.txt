Protocol 1VIT14037 
 
Title:  A Double-Blind, Multi-Center, Randomized, Placebo-C ontrolled Study to Investigate the Efficacy and 
Safety of Injectafer® (Ferric Ca rboxymaltose) in the Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). 
 Investigational Drug: Injectafer® (Ferric Carboxymaltose)  
                                     Objectives:  The primary objective of this st udy is to evaluate the efficac y and safety of intravenous 
Injectafer®  in subjects with  Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). 
 Study Design:  This will be a Phase III, double blind, multi-ce nter, randomized, placebo-controlled study. All 
subjects who meet the inclusion requirements and no exclusion criteria will qualify to enter up to a 7 day 
Screening Phase to enroll 200 eligible subjects for study drug treatment.  All eligible subjects will be stratified 
at baseline by [CONTACT_416696]-related augmentation (no augmentation, uncertain augmentation, definitive 
augmentation).  Randomization will occu r in a 1:1 ratio within each stratum to receive Injectafer® or Placebo 
on Days 0 and 5.  All treated subjects will be followed for efficacy and safety fo r 12 months.  Subjects will visit 
the clinic  on Days 0 and 5 for treatment, and then on Da ys 14, 42, 168, and 365. In between the clinic visits 
subjects will be contact[CONTACT_112485] (phone) on Days 28, 84,126, 210, 252, 294, and 336. The subject’s participation in the study will be for 1 year from Day 0.   Study Drug Treatment:  The duration of treatment will be 5 days.  On Day 0 (start of Treatment Phase) 
subjects will be randomized to receive either a 75 0 mg undiluted blinded dose of IV Injectafer® at 
100mg/minute or a blinded Placebo (15 ml  of Normal Sterile Saline [NSS]) IV  push at 2 ml/minute.  On Day 5 
subjects will receive the same blinded treatment as given on Day 0.  
Tapering Algorithms of RLS Treatment Regimens:  Each subject will be tape red from the prescribed RLS 
medication post treatment beginning on the evening of Da y [ADDRESS_525099]’s current medication and dosing (see Appendix III).  It is  expected that all subject’s will 
be tapered off their current treatment for RLS, but in th e rarity a subject, at the end of the allotted tapering 
period, is unable to achieve a dose of zero (0) the subject should maintain on the lowest dose level attained at 
the end of the tapering period and that dose should remain stable for the duration of th e subjects participation in 
the study. During the tapering period and through Day [ADDRESS_525100] Day 42: Subjects who have not had an interv ention may receive additional blinded 
study drug treatment at the discretion of the Investigator after Day 42.  An interv ention is defined as either 1) an 
increase in dosage from the RLS me dication at study entry, 2)  the initiation of a ne w RLS medication, or 3) 
resumption of the previous medication prescribed for RLS, or 4) increas e in dosage from the RLS medication 
achieved at the end of the tapering period.  The subject will receive the same blinde d study medication that was 
previously assigned.  Subj ects will receive either a single blinded  dose of Injectafer® at 750 mg undiluted at 
100mg/minute or a Placebo (15 ml of Normal Sterile Saline [NSS]) IV push at 2 m l/minute on two independent 
days separated by 5 days. Dosing should mirror the origin al treatment / follow-up period (dosing [ADDRESS_525101] dose).  No 
subject assessments are completed unl ess the dosing or follow-up days fall on an assessment day in the follow-
up period.  Eligible subject will have  met the following requirements prio r to receiving additional treatment: 
 IRLS score ≥15  
 TSAT <45% (confirmation can be through a local laboratory) 
 Ferritin <300 ng/mL  (confirmation can  be through a lo cal laboratory)

No additional iron may be administered between Day 320 and the Day 365 visit. 
 Efficacy and Safety Follow-up:  The duration of the study will be 12 months.  After treatment on Days 0 and 5 subjects will visit the clinic on Days  14, 42, 168, and 365. In between the clinic visits subjects will be contact[CONTACT_368987] (phone) on Days 28, 84, 126, 210, 252, 294, and 336.  Subj ects will be considered to have reached the 
end of the study for efficacy when intervention is require d for RLS symptoms and the subjects will continue the 
follow-up phase for safety.    
Efficacy and Safety Evaluations (see Ta ble 1, Schedule of Events, for details) 
 
Efficacy evaluations will include:  
1. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) performed by [CONTACT_10670] (CGI-I)  
2. International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Score 
3. Clinical Global Impression (CG I) performed by [CONTACT_27720] (CGI-S) 
4. Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life (RLS-QLI)  
5. Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Sleep Scale 
6. Fatigue Linear Analog Scale 
 Safety Evaluations will include:   
1. Adverse events 
2. Laboratory assessments, including hematology (H gb, Hct, RBC, WBC, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, 
platelets, differential count ), iron indices (serum  iron, serum ferritin, and to tal iron binding capacity 
(TIBC), percentage serum transferrin saturation (TSAT)),  clinic al chemistry (sodium, potassium, 
chloride, BUN, creatinine, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, gamma-GGT, AST, ALT, LDH, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, bicarbonate) and  other (trans ferrin receptor and Lymphocyte

initiation of a new RLS medication, 3) resumption of the previous medication prescribed for RLS or, 4) increase 
in dosage from the RLS medication achieved at the e nd of the tapering period. Any subject who has an 
intervention will no longer be evaluated for efficacy st arting at the time of the intervention, however these 
subjects will remain in the study and be evaluated for safety.  
 
Inclusion Criteria: 
                    
1. Male or female subject’s ≥[ADDRESS_525102] be met:

RLS
Therapy:   
All subjects should be on a stable RLS monotherapy regimen (see Appendix III) for at least [ADDRESS_525108] Day 5 
treatment with study drug.  An algorithm of RLS medication taper regimens is provided (Appendix III).  
If and when the subject is tapered off the RLS medication, the goal will be for the subject to remain off 
their medication or remain on the lowest dose level achieved for the duration of the study.  If during the 
course of the study it becomes necessary to restart therapy via subject and physician decision, these data 
points will be collected and the subject will no longer be evaluated for efficacy, but the subject will 
continue in the study for safety analysis.   
Study Endpoints:    
The co-primary efficacy variables will be IRLS total sc ore change from baseline to Day 42 and the proportion 
of patients rated as “much” or “ver y much” improved with the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) performed by 
[CONTACT_10670] (CGI-I) on Day 42.   
The major secondary endpoints will be test ed in a hierarchical or der, that is, statistica l significance for major 
secondary efficacy endpoint will be declared only if the primary efficacy  test (IRLS and CGI-I on Day 42) is 
statistically significant.  Becau se a hierarchical testing scheme is used, no adjustments of the alpha level will be 
needed at each stage of testing.  All tests will be done at an alpha ≤ 0.05. 
The major secondary efficacy endpoints in ranked order of testing include: 
1.Clinical Global Impression (CGI) pe rformed by [CONTACT_27720] (CGI-S) on Day 42.
2.Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life (RLS-QLI) change from baseline to Day 42.
3.Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Sleep Scal e change from baseline to Day 42.
4.Fatigue Linear Analog Scale ch ange from baseline to Day 42.
Other efficacy endpoints: 
1.Proportion of responders (any improvement) based on CGI-I at each time point.
2.IRLS total score change from baseline at each time point.
3.Proportion of responders based on CGI-S at each time point.
4.RLS-QLI scores change from baseline at each time point.
5.MOS Sleep scale total score change from baseline at each time point.
6.Fatigue Linear Analog Scale total score ch ange from baseline at each time point.
7.Augmentation Scale change between baseline , Day 42, Day 168 and end of study (Day 365).
8.Proportion of subjects require  intervention for RLS.
9.Number of days from Day 5 to next dose of study drug.
The safety endpoints include: 
1.Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEA E) and incidence of seri ous adverse events (SAE)

Blinding:     
                
All subjects, investigators and study personnel will be blin ded to the content of study drug with the exception of 
the unblinded study personnel who will be  responsible for the following: 
o Randomizing the subject on Day 0 through IRT system.  
o Preparing, concealing and administering the study drug on Day 0 and 5 (as Injectafer®  is reddish-brown 
and slightly viscous).[ADDRESS_525109] and applicable electronic case 
report form pages.  
o Assessment of blinded laboratory parameters (iron indices and phosphorus). 
o Retention of any source documents to which the invest igator and the site study team is blinded (i.e. post-
randomization IRLS questionnaires/scores, su bjects’ CGI scores, dosing information). 
 
Study Duration:   
 Screening Phase:  up to 7 days 
 Treatment Phase:  5 days  
 Follow-up Phase: 12 months 
 
Number of Subjects: 
 
Enrollment is planned for 200 subjects (100 per group) at study sites in the Un ited States (US), Poland, 
Hungary, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Spain.  
Sample Size: 
 
Sample size estimates were based on the modified in tent to treat (MITT) popul ation for Study 1VIT05009.  The 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases (OC) results on Day 28 were used for the co-
primary efficacy endpoint (CGI) and first-ranked seconda ry endpoint (IRLS).  It is unclear how treatment 
differences on Day [ADDRESS_525110] deviations. 
 Co-primary efficacy endpoint (IRLS): The smallest trea tment difference for change from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_525111] deviation of 8.5.  A sample  size of per 100/group provides 95% power under this 
scenario.  Co-primary efficacy endpoint (CGI-I): The smallest tr eatment difference on Day 28 was 45% versus 15% of 
patients in the FCM and placebo groups, respectively, who reported much or very much improvement on the patient CGI.  A sample size of 100/group provides >99% power.  A sample size of  per 100/group has at least 
90% power when the treatment differen ce is as small as 45% versus 22%.

region (US, Europe) as the stratificat ion factor.  Treatment group differences for changes in total and domain 
scores of rating scales (eg, IRLS) will be assessed with the analysis of covariance with fixed factors for region 
(US, Europe) and treatment and with baseline score as a covariate.  Treatment diffe rences for proportions will 
be assessed with the continuity -corrected chi-square test.   
 The primary imputation method for the CGI and change in total/domain scores will be LOCF.  Sensitivity 
analyses will assess the impact of missing values on inferences.  Time from Day [ADDRESS_525113] study visit. 
 Analyses of safety data will be descriptive and no formal statistical co mparisons will be made.

Page 15 1.0 INTRODUCTION             
1.1  The Natural History, Disease Understanding, and Treatment Guidance for Restless Legs 
Syndrome (RLS) 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS), is a circadian disorder of sensory-motor integrati on that may be related to 
dysregulation of iron transport ac ross the blood-brain barrier.[ADDRESS_525123] geographic 
variation in the prevalence of RLS, with estimates rangi ng from 2-10% in general popul ations, and as high as 20 
% in certain target populati ons with secondary RLS/.2-5    Pharmacologic therapy for primary RLS are broadly 
based on short-term randomized, controlled trials that  enrolled highly-selected pa tient populations with long-
term, high-moderate to very severe symptoms.6-8 Current treatment regimens for RLS include dopamine 
agonists, calcium channel alpha-2-delta ( α2δ) ligands, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].9-[ADDRESS_525124].9,11-13 Evidence-based guidelines and prac tice support investigations that ta rget trials of intravenous (IV) 
iron in RLS.[ADDRESS_525125] associated anemia from various causes (g astric ulcer, leukemia, and chronic nephritis) with the 
development of restless legs and as well as symptom resolution following blood transfusions.[ADDRESS_525126] contri buted to the disease understanding of low central nervous system 
iron stores in RLS as follows:   
In 2000, C. J. Earley et al.  reported a comparison of 16 patients with idiopathic RLS compared to 8 age-
matched healthy control subjects.17 Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) ferritin levels were lower (1.11+ 0.25 mg/L 
versus 3.50 + 0.55 mg/L; p =0.0002) and CSF transferrin levels were high er (26.4 + 5.1 mg/L versus 6.71 
+ 1.6 mg/L; p = 0.018) in idiopathic RLS s ubjects compared with control subjects.17  There w ere no  
differences in serum ferritin and serum transferrin levels between the 2 groups.   
In 2001, R.P. Allen et al. reported  a  study of 5 RLS patients and 5 control subjects that assessed brain
iron concentrations.18  A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) m easurement utilizing relaxation rates of 
both hemispheres (R 21 and R 2) identified that R [ADDRESS_525127] s with RLS, both in proportion to the RLS severity.18  
In 2003, J.R. Connor et al.   demonstrated reduced iron concentrati ons in the substantia nigra using MRI
techniques and concluded that RLS may be a functional disorder resul ting from impaired iron acquisition 
in the central nervous system (CNS).19 
Subsequent studies over the past decade support that reduction in CN S iron among patients with RLS may
be a functional consequence to impa ired iron acquisition by [CONTACT_416697], with a putative defect 
in regulation of the transferrin receptors.20-[ADDRESS_525128] practice guidance for RLS. Th e report summarized that “Long-term 
clinical experience with the treatment of patients with RLS has revealed both the significance of problems that 
arise during the short term (e.g., weight gain, impulse control disord ers [ICDs], mood disturbances) and the 
emergence of new problems during long-term treatment (e.g., augmentation, loss of efficacy).”9  Overall, 
extensive RLS research has led to the conclusion that the pathophysiolo gy of idiopathic RLS involves iron 
homeostatic dysregulation and th at there is a role for iron treatment in RLS.

Page 16 1.3 The Role of Iron Treatment in RLS 
In studied populations, iron therapy a ppears to treat the specif ic mechanism of RLS pathology in some patients 
with low iron levels in the brain.25  Very early after the identification of  the condition, IV treatment with 
saccharated oxide of iron was shown to be quite successful.26  Nordlander reported that IV iron therapy 
(generally given as 100 – 200 mg every 1 to 4 days) was co mpletely effective at eliminating symptoms in 21 of 
22 patients (95.5%) for periods of up to 3-9 months, as well as effective in eliminating symptoms even in 
patients without anemia and with normal serum iron.26  Earley et al. reported similar efficacy in an open label 
study of 10 RLS patients, of whom 60%  reported complete remission of RLS symptoms for 3 to 36 months after 
intravenous iron dextran.27  
In 2005, Earley et al. evaluated the efficacy and safety of repeated infusions of IV iron to maintain symptomatic 
RLS improvements achieved with a prior single 1,000 mg infusion of iron dextran.28  If symptoms returned at 
any time in the 2-year period after initial iron treatment, supplemental in fusions of 450 mg of iron gluconate 
infusions could be given, provided th e ferritin was <300 mcg/l.  Five out of 10 subjects received supplemental 
iron,  three of whom received be tween 2-4 courses of supplemental iron over the 2 year study period.28 The 
authors concluded that achieving high ferritin levels was not a gua rantee of sustained improvements.28  In a 
randomized, placebo controlled study of IV iron in RLS in 25 subjects with end stage renal disease (ERSD), 
1,000 mg (given at <6 mg/min) of IV iron dextran produ ced a significant reduction in the symptoms of RLS as 
measured by [CONTACT_416698].29  In a multicentered, placebo-contro lled clinical trial of IV ferric 
carboxymaltose (FCM) treatment for RLS, FCM signifi cantly improved primary and secondary outcomes 
compared to placebo.30 In the comparison of FCM to placebo treatm ent, the IRLS severity scale mean  (SD) 
decrease was 8.9 (8.52) versus 4.0 (6.11) , p=0.040, and the Clinical Global I nventory of Change (CGI-1) score 
of very much or much improved was 48.3% versus 14.3%, p=0.004; there were no si gnificant adverse events.[ADDRESS_525129] 24 weeks for patients.30  
Oral iron has been demonstrated to be effective in RLS patients with iron deficiency  but not in patients without 
iron deficiency. 31-33 The explanation in part may be due to the poor absorption of oral iron in non iron deficient 
patients and that large iron doses are required to cross the blood brain barrie r.  Silber and Richardson described 
a RLS patient population  who were identified as having iron deficiency and a history of frequent blood 
donations.16  The hemoglobin range was 10.6 to 15.5 gm/dl in this  cohort and all 8 patie nts were iron deficient 
(defined as low serum ferritins ranges 3 to 15 g/l).  After correction of iron stor es with oral ir on, symptoms of 
RLS resolved in 2 patients and 2 others were  able to discontinue other RLS medications.16 
The 2012 Cochrane Database Systematic Review of iron for RLS provided a summary of 192 subjects from six 
studies.29,33-38   In the four trials that used the IRLS severity scale, there were trials of IV iron sucrose (N=2), 
oral iron (N=1), and IV FCM (N=1).33,35,36,38   The combined IRLS data from these RLS trials was not 
associated with clear benefit (mean difference in scores of -3.79, 95% CI: -7.68 to 0.10, p = 0.06), yet the 
placebo-controlled trial of FCM and of oral iron (in low-normal ferritin s ubjects) reported significant treatment 
benefit compared to placebo.33,35  The subsequent data in the publication of the FCM trial was aligned with the 
preliminary findings reported in the Cochrane Database Systematic Review.30,34,35

Page 17 1.4  Injectafer®  (Ferric Carboxymaltose) 
 
1.4.1 Key features of Injectafer®  
 
Injectafer®  (Ferric Carboxymaltose Injection) is a stable Type I pol ynuclear iron (III)- hydroxide carbohydrate 
complex developed as an IV iron replacement therapy for the treatment of IDA. After IV administration, 
Injectafer® is mainly found in the reticaloendothelial system (RLS) whic h includes the liver, spleen, and bone 
marrow.  The iron slowly dissociates from the comple x and can be efficiently used in the bone marrow for 
hemoglobin synthesis.  The carbohydrate moiety of Injectafer® is metabolized by [CONTACT_416699].  
Injectafer®  is approved for the treatment of IDA and an investig ational product on th e study of RLS. 
 1.4.2 Injectafer®  versus Other Parenteral Iron Agents 
 
There is considerable efficacy and safety experience w ith the various available parenteral iron preparations. 
However, prior to the approval of non-dextran formulations , the risk of systemic adverse reactions restricted 
their use.  Injectafer®  offers signi ficant advantages compared to othe r available IV iron preparations.  
 Iron dextran, the first parenteral iron product available in the US, has been associated with an incidence of 
anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions (i.e., dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, ur ticaria, angioedema) as high as 
1.7%.  Over the last [ADDRESS_525130] been  attributed to the use of IV iron dextran. The 
anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions ar e believed to be caused by [CONTACT_416700].   Iron dextran is limited to second-line therapy for treatment of ir on deficiency.  High molecular weight 
(HMW) iron dextran is reportedly as sociated with a higher rate of lif e-threatening adverse events and 
anaphylactic reactions in comparison to low molecular weight (L MW) iron dextran, the US Food and Drug 
Administration was unable to find a clear  difference after an examination of post-marketing data, clinical trial 
data, death certificates, and emergency room diagnoses.   
 Non-dextran IV irons like iron sucr ose and iron gluconate do not contain the dextran moiety, but they have 
significant dosage and admi nistration rate limitations.
   If the body’s ability to handl e (i.e., sequester, store, and 
transport) iron is overwhelmed, a reacti on to excess free iron referred to as a bioactive iron reacti on may occur.    
These reactions are characterized by [CONTACT_27913] (without  allergic signs) accompanied by [CONTACT_416701], 
abdomen, flank and/or nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.   Due to its structure, Injectafer® is more stable than  iron gluconate and iron sucr ose.  Injectafer® a slow 
delivery of the complexed iron to endogenous iron bi nding sites and has an acute  toxicity in animals 
approximately 1/5 that of iron sucrose.  These characteristics of Injectafer® make it possible to administer much 
higher single doses over shorter periods of time iron gluconate or iron sucrose, resulting in fewer 
administrations to replenish iron stor es, and convenient outpatient use (Table [IP_ADDRESS]).   Ferumoxytol is a 
modified-dextran derivative currentl y indicated for IDA associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It was 
recently withdrawn from use in the EU a nd given a black box warning in the US.  
 
1.4.3 Injectafer® Human Experience:  Ma rketed Use and the RLS indicator 
 
The Injectafer®  clinical development program demonstrated  the safety and effectivene ss of IV Injectafer®  in 
the treatment of IDA.  The drug is indicated for the tr eatment of IDA in adult populat ions who have intolerance 
to oral iron or have had unsatisfact ory responses to oral ir on or non-dialysis depende nt CKD (see Appendix I). 
Clinical data are currently available from 20 Phase 2 and 3 studies including 5,799 patients, with IDA or IDA 
associated with CKD who received Injectafer®.

Page 18 A clinical pharmacokinetic study (VIT-IV-CL-001) usi ng positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated a 
fast initial elimination of radioactively labeled iron (Fe) 52Fe/59Fe Injectafer®  from the blood, with rapid 
transfer to the bone marrow and rapid deposition in the liver and spleen. Eight hours after administration, 5 to 
20% of the injected amount was still in the blood. 
 Important details of pre-clinical and clinical safety and efficacy can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Ferric carboxymaltose received approva l from the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]) Me dicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approval on June 15, 2007 for the use of Injectafer®  (EU Trade name: [CONTACT_416749]) 
in 18 European Union (EU) countries and later in Sw itzerland.  Ferric carboxymaltose  was first approved as a 
prescription only medicine on July 6, 2007 in The Neth erlands.  Up until now, Injectafer®  has received 
regulatory approval for marketing aut horization in 58 countries  worldwide: Argentina,  Australia, Austria, 
Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile , Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Fi nland, [LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland,

(FDA) on July 25, 2013. 
 
2.0  TRIAL OBJECTIVE 
 
2.1  Primary Objective 
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effi cacy and safety of an IV Injectafer® in subjects with 
Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS).  
3.0  RATIONALE AND OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1  Rationale 
 
Injectafer® is a non-dextran IV iron approved by [CONTACT_416702] (FDA) .  In an earlier 
phase II study (1VIT05009)
 Injectafer® was found to be safe and well tolerated for the treatment of RLS.30  Based 
on these findings a larger phase III tria l will be conducted to fu rther investigate and confir m the use of Injectafer®  
in the treatment of RLS.    Further justification is also based on the pathophysiol ogy of iron in RLS as summarized in the Introduction 
(Section 1.0)   
3.2  Trial Design 
 
This is a Phase III, double blinded, multi-center, random ized, placebo-controlled study. All subjects who meet 
the inclusion requirements and no exclus ion criteria will qualify to enter up to  a 7 day Screening Phase to enroll 
200 eligible subjects for study drug treatment.  All elig ible subjects will be stra tified at baseline by [CONTACT_416703]-related augmentation (no augmentation, un certain augmentation, definitive augmentation) on 
standard of care RLS therapy.  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio with in each stratum to  receive either 
Injectafer® or IV Placebo on Days 0 and 5. All treated su bjects will be followed for efficacy and safety for 12 
months.  Subjects will visit the clinic  on Days 0 and 5 for treatment, and then on Days 14, 42, 168, and 365. In 
between the clinic visits subj ects will be contact[CONTACT_112485] (phone) on Days 28, 84, 126, 210, 252, 294, and 
336. The subject’s participation in the st udy will be for 1 year from Day 0.

All subjects, investigators, and study personnel will be b linded to the content of study drug with the exception 
of the unblinded study personnel.  All study personnel will be blinded to the iron indi ces (after randomization) 
throughout the study.    
[IP_ADDRESS]    Unblinded Personnel             
 
The unblinded study personnel  will be responsible for the following: 
 
o Randomizing the subject on Day 0 through IRT system  
o Preparing, concealing and administering the study drug on Day 0 and 5 (as Injectafer® is reddish-brown and slightly viscous).
[ADDRESS_525150] and applicable electronic case 
report form pages.  
o Assessment of blinded laboratory parameters (iron indices and phosphorus). 
o Retention of any source documents to which the invest igator and the site study t eam is blinded (ie. post-
randomization IRLS questionnaires/scores, su bjects’ CGI scores, dosing information). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Blinded Personnel             
 
The blinded study personnel  will be responsible for all other study re lated activities.  During the period of 
study drug administration the blinded personnel will not be present.  However, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_416679]/or the need for adverse event assessment. All study 
personnel will be blinded to the post-treatment iron indices as the values may reveal the blind.  
 The blinding will be maintained until the study is complete  and the database has been locked. In the event of an 
emergency that would require the inves tigator to be aware of the treatment allocation prior to database lock; the 
investigator can obtain this information, on a per subject basis, from the S ponsor’s electronic database at the 
Investigative site.  It is recommended to contact [CONTACT_456]’s Medical Monitor or designee prior to 
unblinding .  If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded,  the sponsor must be c ontacted immediately via 
telephone.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Investigator Blinding             
 
In addition to the above, the blinded i nvestigator will be blinded to the IR LS score and subject CGI score for each 
subject after randomization.   
5.3  Study Drug Admini stration      
 
On Days 0 and 5, subjects will either receive a 75 0 mg undiluted blinded dose of IV Injectafer® at 
100mg/minute or a blinded Placebo ( 15 ml of Normal Sterile Saline [N SS]) IV push at 2ml/minute.

whether or not it is related to the inve stigational product, must be recorded on the Adverse Event page of the case 
report form.  
A distinction of symptomology, when feasible, should be made for study drug versus RLS medication taper. 
For any laboratory a bnormality, the physician will make a judgment as to  its clinical significan ce.  If the laboratory 
value is outside the safety limits and is felt to represent a clinically significant worseni ng from the baseline value, it 
should be considered an adve rse event and should be recorded on the Adverse Events  page of the case report form. If 
the laboratory value is outside  the normal range, but not an  adverse event, the investig ator should comment on the 
findings (i.e. “not clin ically significant” or “unchanged from baseline”)  in the source docum entation [laboratory 
report]. For the purposes of this study, worsening of RLS symptoms, low or high ir on indices will not be  considered adverse 
events. These values are reported in e fficacy summaries.          
To quantify the severity of  adverse events the Nation al Cancer Institute, NCI-Co mmon Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [CTCAE], Version 4.[ADDRESS_525177],  the investigator should use Table 7.1. 1 to assign the adverse event grade.

5 Death Results in Death due to the AE 
Timing:  Non-serious adverse events will be reported from the init ial treatment with st udy drug through the 
completion of the study Day 365.  AE’s will be captured during a follow-up phone call [ADDRESS_525178] 
dose of study drug for subjects who are randomized and early terminate from th e trial.  All ongoing  adverse events 
related to study drug (i .e., Injectafer® or Normal Steril e Saline) should be foll owed until they are no longer related, 
have taken a confounding medication or  return to base line grade.   
Relationship (Causality):  The Investigator will be  asked to document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_416682]: 
NONE There nois  evidence of any causal relationship. 
UNLIKELY There is little evidence to suggest there is a causal relationship.  There is another
reasonable explanation for the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, 
other concomitant treatments). 
POSSIBLE There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (i.e. there is a reasonable
possibility that the adverse experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_416714]).  However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). 
PROBABLE There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is
unlikely. 
For the purposes of this trial, “study drug” is defined as: Injectafer® or Normal Sterile Saline.  
7.2 Reporting of Adverse Events 
Adverse experiences will be elicit ed by [CONTACT_416715]  “Have you noticed any problems?”  
Subjects will be encouraged to report adverse events at the onset.   Any adve rse experience spontaneously 
reported by, elicited from the subject or observed by [CONTACT_416716].  The investig ator will record the date and time of onset, severity, 
the relationship to study medication, the date and time of resolution (or the fact that the event is still 
continuing), the action taken, and the outcome of the adverse experience on  the Adverse Event page of the 
eCRF.  Whenever possible, the inve stigator should group together, into a single term, signs and symptoms 
which constitute a single diagnosis.  For example, cough, rhinitis and sneezing might be grouped together as 
"upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]."  
7.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
Definition : An adverse event is classified as SERIOUS if it meets any one of the following criteria:  
Death
Life-Threatening:  The subject was at substantial risk of dying at the time of  the adverse event or it is
suspected that the use / conti nued use of the product would re sult in the subject's death.

A distinction should be drawn between SAE and severe AE.  A severe AE is a major experience of its type.  A 
severe AE is not necessarily serious : e.g. nausea, which persists for seve ral hours, may be considered severe 
nausea, but it is not an SAE.  In c ontrast, a stroke, which resu lts in only a limited degree  of disability may be 
considered a mild stroke, but would be a SAE.  Timing:  All SAEs will be reported from the day of initial treatment with study drug through the completion of 
the study Day 365.  The SAEs will be captured during a follow-up phone call [ADDRESS_525179] dose of study drug for subjects who are randomized and early terminate from the trial.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_416683] (present prior to initial tr eatment with study drug or prescheduled prior to

longer serious or return to baseline grade.    Reporting : Any SAE, starting with the first dose of study drug, that is to be reported (as outlined in 
Timing section above) must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event) to Luitpold Ph armaceuticals, Inc. by [CONTACT_756], em ail and/or fax of the written SAE

In addition to the above reporting, all SAEs must be recorded on the Adverse Even t page of the eCRF and 
reported immediately to your IRB / ethics  committee per their reporting guidelines. 
 The responsible investigator must de termine whether the degree of any unt oward event warrants removal of any 
subject from the study.  He/she should, in any case, inst itute appropriate diagnostic a nd/or therapeutic measures, 
and keep the subject under observation fo r as long as is medically indicated. 
 
7.4      Other Reportable Information 
 
As part of the continuous assessment of the risk-benef it profile for the life cycle of pharmaceutical products, 
regulatory agencies require monitoring of occurrences that while  not considered adverse events, are considered 
“other reportable information”.   Fo r this protocol, other reportable info rmation refers to: tapering of RLS 
medications (Section 7.5) as well as drug exposure during pregnancy and / or lactation exposure (irrespective of 
any reported fetal abnormalities or any adverse effect in mother and/or child).  Pregnancy exposure and 
lactation exposure should be reported to the Luitpold’s Pharmacovigilance Department by [CONTACT_54769]/or fax using the pregnancy tracking form  to the contact [CONTACT_416717]:

In addition to the reporting of adverse events (Sec tion 7.2) and serious adverse events (Section 7.3), the 
potential risks associated with the taper and withdrawal from  RLS medication will be elicited and determined 
by [CONTACT_416718] d or not related to the taper and the withdrawal of the RLS medication and 
captured in the eCRF.   The signs and symptoms associ ated with taper and withdr awal from RLS medications 
may include worsening of RLS symptoms, inclusive of an  increase in limb movement s, periodic leg movement 
symptoms defined as Periodic Limb Movement of Sl eep (PLMS) or Periodic Limb Movement while Awake 
(PLMA), insomnia, decreased daytime alertness, lo w mood, depression, anxiousne ss, and hallucinations.  
Reported class-specific events associated with the tape ring and withdrawal of RLS medications, as potentially 
distinct from adverse events (Secti on 7.2) and serious adverse events (Sec tion 7.3) are listed in Table 7.5.1.   
The dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS) has been defined as a severe , stereotyped cluster of 
physical and psychological symptoms that correlate w ith dopamine agonist withdrawal in a dose-dependent 
manner.8,39 The severity and prognosis of DAWS (Table 7.5.1) is variable in duration.   While there are several 
potential adverse events associated with the calcium channel α2δ ligands, the withdrawal symptoms likely 
include insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, diarrhea (Tab le 7.5.1).  The high-potency opi[INVESTIGATOR_416686] ( Table 7.5.1).   It is

the database.    The number of subjects in each treatment group w ill be summarized for each investigative site.  
Baseline characteristics (e.g., sex and race) will be summ arized with the number and categorical percent of 
subjects with the character istic in each anal ysis population an d treatment group.  
  
Quantitative characteristics (e.g., age and weight) will be summarized with the mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum value, and maximum value in  each analysis population and treatment group.   
Medical history will be coded with the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Terminology. 
The number and percent of subjects with clinically significant medical history at screening will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and pr eferred term for all subjects. 
 
8.4 Endpoints and Definitions 
 
8.4.1 Primary Endpoints 
 
The co-primary efficacy variables will be IRLS total scor e change from baseline to  Day 42 and the proportion 
of patients rated as much or very much improved pe r the CGI-I performed by [CONTACT_386183] (CGI-I) on Day 42.  
Baseline values used for evaluation will be defined as th e latest value obtained prior to the first dose of study 
drug.  For those subjects with only one value prior to  dosing, the single value will be used as baseline.

Rescue Medication Removed 
Intervention Original Wording Intervention and Relapse:   
Intervention is defined as the initiation or resumption of equivalent or increased 
treatment previously prescribed by a physic ian used to specifically relieve the 
symptoms of RLS following the subject’s assessment that the RLS symptoms are 
intolerable. Any subject who has an inte rvention will no longer be evaluated for 
efficacy starting at the time of the interven tion, however these subjects will remain in 
the study and will be continued to  be evaluated for safety.  
Relapse is defined as the prescribed treatment for the subject’s RLS symptom is at a lower dose than previously taken. Efficacy a nd safety evaluation will continue to be 
performed on all subjects who have relapsed.  
Intervention New Wording Intervention is defined  as an increase or change in the treatment currently 
prescribed by a physician used to specifically relieve the symptoms of RLS following the subject’s assessment that the RLS symptoms are intolerable or the subject meets the criteria a nd qualifies for additional treat ment with study drug.  Any 
subject who has an intervention will no l onger be evaluated for efficacy starting at 
the time of the intervention, however these subjects will remain in the study and will 
be continued to be evaluated for safety.  
Inclusion Criteria Original Wording 3. Subjects not currently receiving treatment, have RLS symptoms ≥ [ADDRESS_525213] 3 months.  
4. A baseline score ≥  15 on the IRLS Rating Scale.  
Inclusion Criteria New Wording 3. Subjects should be on a stable (FDA a pproved) RLS treatment for at least 8 
weeks prior to screening. 
4. A score ≥ 15 on the IRLS Rating Scale at screening and on Day 0 prior to 
dosing.  
New Wording RLS   
Therapy:    
All subjects should be on a FDA a pproved RLS therapy.  The subject’s 
therapy should be stable for at leas t [ADDRESS_525214] will continue in the study for safety analysis.   
Study Endpoints in Synopsis and Section 8.4.2 Original Wording The primary efficacy variable will be the pr oportion of patients rated as much or very 
much improved with the Clinical Global Im pression (CGI) performed by [CONTACT_10670] 
(CGI-I) on Day 42.  The major secondary endpoin ts will be tested in a hierarchical 
order, that is, statistical significance fo r major secondary efficacy endpoint will be 
declared only if the primary efficacy te st (CGI-I on Day 42) is statistically 
significant.  Because a hierarchical testi ng scheme is used, no adjustments of the 
alpha level will be needed at each stage of testing.  All te sts will be done at an alpha 
≤ 0.05.

Study Endpoints in Synopsis and Section 8.4.2 New Wording The co-primary efficacy variables will be IR LS total score change from baseline to 
Day 42 and the proportion of patients rated as much or very much improved with the 
Clinical Global Impression (CGI) perfor med by [CONTACT_10670] (CGI-I) on Day 42.   
The major secondary endpoints will be tested  in a hierarchical  order, that is, 
statistical significance for major secondary e fficacy endpoint will be declared only if 
the primary efficacy test (IRLS and CGI-I on Day 42) is statistically significant.  
Because a hierarchical testing scheme is us ed, no adjustments of the alpha level will 
be needed at each stage of testing.  All tests will be done at an alpha ≤ 0.05.

Sample Size Estimates Original Wording Sample size estimates were based on the MITT population for Study VIT 5009.  The last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases (OC) results on Day 28 
were used for the primary efficacy endpoint (CGI) and first ranked secondary endpoint (IRLS).  It is un clear how treatment differences on Day [ADDRESS_525216] deviations. 
Primary efficacy endpoint (CGI): The smallest treatment difference on Day 28 was 45% versus 15% of patients in the FC M and placebo groups, respectively, who 
reported much or very much improvement on the patient CGI (Tables [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]).  A sample size of 300/group provide s >99% power.  A sample size of 
300/group has at least 95% power when the tr eatment difference is as small as 28% 
versus 15%. First ranked secondary endpoint (IRLS): The smallest treatment difference for 
change from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_525217] error was subtracted from  the treatment difference (4.4 – 1.8 = 2.6) 
and the standard deviation was rounde d up to 9.  A sample size of 300/group 
provides 95% power un der this scenario.

1.3: The Role of Iron 
Treatment in RLS Updated 1.3: The Natural History, Disease Understanding, and Treatment 
Guidance for Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) 
 
Original Wording Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a comm on under-diagnosed disorder occurring 
in 2% to 15% of the general population depending on the source of information.  It 
is reported principally in the elderly but may occur at any time.  As early as the 
1950’s, iron was thought to play a role in the onset and treatment of Restless Legs 
Syndrome (RLS), first described by [CONTACT_416741].[ADDRESS_525253] associated anemia 
from various causes (gastric ulcer, le ukemia and chronic nephritis) with the 
development of restless legs that disa ppeared following treatment with blood 
transfusion.[ADDRESS_525254] found RLS to be associated with other 
conditions where iron is limiting such as in pregnancy3, hemodialysis4, and 
frequent blood donations.5 It was also noted that the incidence of the condition 
increased from the general population to  more than 20% in these patient 
populations.  
 
New Wording Restless legs syndrome (RLS), is a circadia n disorder of sensory-motor integration 
that may be related to dysregulation of iron transport across the blood-brain 
barrier.[ADDRESS_525255] ge ographic variation in the prevalence of 
RLS, with estimates ranging from 2-10% in general populations, and as high as 20 % in certain target populati ons with secondary RLS/.
2-5    Pharmacologic therapy 
for primary RLS are broadly based on shor t-term randomized, controlled trials that 
enrolled highly-selected patient populations  with long-term, high-moderate to very 
severe symptoms.6-8 Current treatment regimens for RLS include dopamine 
agonists, calcium channel alpha-2-delta ( α2δ) ligands, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].9-[ADDRESS_525256].9,11-13 Evidence-based guidelines and practice

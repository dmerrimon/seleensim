The
contact
[CONTACT_201904]
(PI)
(G
Elwyn)
and
the
dual
PI
(M-A
Durand)
have
discussed
and
approved
this
protocol.
The
investigators
agree
to
perform
the
investigations
and
to
abide
by
[CONTACT_201905]ﬁcant

are
mutually
agreed

[ADDRESS_240798]
used
the
term
‘vaccine
hesitancy’
to
describe
this
uncertainty.
People
are
hesitant
to
get
vaccinated
for
many
reasons.
Some
people
worry
that
scientists
developed
the
COVID-[ADDRESS_240799]
higher
rates
of
vaccine
hesitancy.
This
includes
a
group
of
healthcare
professionals
who
work
in
places
like
nursing
homes,
usually
called
long-term
care
workers
(LTCWs).
Many
LTCWs
do
not
want
or
plan
to
get
vaccinated.
LTCWs
are
an
important
group
to
target
because
they
serve
a
high-risk,
elderly
population.
They
have
a
higher
risk
of
passing
the
virus
on
to
others.
LTCWs
are
among
the
lowest
paid
workers
in
the
US.
They
come
from
diverse
communities,
including
those
that
have
experienced
high
rates
of
infection,
illness
and
death
from
COVID-19.
There
are
policy
mandates
that
were
developed
in
[ADDRESS_240800]
people
in
one
of
these
three
groups
(the
live
webinar
group,
the
social
media
website
group,
or
the
usual
information
group)
based
on
chance.
We
will
compare
peoples’
level
of
confidence
in
the
vaccine
across
these
groups.
To
better
understand
how
the
social
media
website
and
live
webinars
might
influence
people,
we
will
also
measure
how
informed
people
feel
about
the
vaccines,
what
they
believe
about
the
vaccines,
and
their
trust
in
information
about
the
vaccines
given
by
[CONTACT_201906].
We
will
collect
this
information
using
online
surveys.
We
will
give
the
first
survey
to
participants
when
they
join
the
study.
Then,
we
will
invite
them
to
join
the
live
webinar,
use
the
social
media
website,
or
access
the
usual
information
website
(CDC
website).
Lastly,
they
will
get
three
more
surveys,
[ADDRESS_240801]
Background
and
Significance:
Vaccination
programs
have
the
potential
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
COVID-[ADDRESS_240802]
eroded
confidence
in
the
vaccine,
causing
hesitancy
and
reduced
uptake.
Long
term
care
workers
(LTCWs)
report
substantial
vaccine
hesitancy.
Unvaccinated
LTCWs
pose
a
risk
of
transmission
to
vulnerable
long-term
care
residents.
Further,
over
50%
of
LTCWs
are
from
minority
and
socioeconomically
disadvantaged
groups,
and
may
be
more
vulnerable
to
severe
disease
if
they
become
infected.
While
vaccine
mandates
have
recently
been
announced
for
workers
in
long-term
care
facilities,
mandates
also
have
the
potential
consequence
of
job
losses,
workplace
shortages,
and
reduced
LTCW
wellbeing.
It
is
therefore
important
to
increase
LTCWs’
confidence
in
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
In
this
trial
we
will
recruit
LTCWs
in
nursing
and
residential
care
settings.
Objectives:
Working
with
our
stakeholders,
we
chose
the
following
research
questions:
1.
What
is
the
comparative
impact
of
two
interventions
designed
to
increase
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
(primary
outcome)
and
influence
secondary
outcomes,
compared
to
enhanced
usual
practice
in
LTCWs?
2.
What
is
the
most
effective
intervention
to
increase
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
among
different
subgroups
of
LTCWs,
including
those
who
experience
different
levels
of
health
disparities?
3.
What
are
the
delivery
characteristics,
contexts,
and
processes
needed
to
sustain
and
scale
up
the
implementation
of
interventions
designed
to
increase
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
among
LTCWs?
6
Design
&
Population:
We
will
conduct
a
three-arm
online
randomized
controlled
trial,
with
randomization
at
the
LTCW
level.
We
will
use
an
effectiveness-implementation
hybrid
design
(type
2),
guided
by
[CONTACT_201907]
(CFIR).
We
will
partner
with
the
National
Association
of
Health
Care
Assistants
(NAHCA)
to
recruit
1800
LTCWs.
Eligible
LTCWs
will
self-identify
as:
1)
being
at
least
18
years
old,
2)
living
in
the
United
States,
3)
having
worked
in
a
long-term
care
setting
in
the
past
two
years,
4)
able
to
verify
their
LTCW
status,
5)
not
currently
be
pregnant
or
breastfeeding,
and
6)
able
to
read,
write,
and
understand
English,
and
7)
being
at
least
somewhat
worried
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines
and/or
not
having
received
any
COVID-19
booster
vaccine.
Contingent
on
study
results,
in
the
sustainability
phase
(see
Figure
3),
we
will
open
the
materials
to
other
LTCWs.
Interventions:
We
selected
two
interactive
interventions
with
our
stakeholder
partners,
based
on
provisional
evidence
of
their
effectiveness
and
Peretti-Watel’s
vaccine
hesitancy
framework.
Interventions
will
be
co-designed
and
adapted
with
LTCWs
and
the
Institute
for
Healthcare
Improvement
(IHI)
co-investigators.
We
will
include
an
enhanced
usual
practice
arm.
Arm
1:
Dialogue-Based
Webinars
Six
hundred
LTCWs
will
attend
virtual
dialogue-based
webinars
in
groups
of
20.
An
existing
COVID-19
conversation
aid
(English
version)
will
be
available
to
all
participants.
Each
webinar
will
be
co-facilitated
by
a
LTCW
and
physician
expert,
and
assisted
by
a
communication
expert.
Arm
2:
Social
Media
Website
Six
hundred
LTCWs
will
be
invited
to
visit
a
curated
COVID-[ADDRESS_240803]
multi-component
content
derived
from
LTCW-nominated
platforms,
e.g.,
Facebook,
YouTube,
etc.
It
will
address
frequent
concerns
and
topi[INVESTIGATOR_201874].
Arm
3:
Enhanced
Usual
Practice
Six
hundred
LTCWs
will
be
directed
to
visit
the
COVID-19
vaccine
information
on
the
CDC
website.
Outcomes:
Our
primary
outcome
is
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
as
assessed
by
[CONTACT_201908],
which
measures
confidence
in
vaccine
safety,
efficacy,
and
importance.
Our
secondary
outcomes
include
COVID-19
vaccine
uptake
(any
dose,
initial
series
completion,
booster
completion),
an
adapted
Net
Promoter
Score
(likelihood
of
recommending
COVID-19
vaccination
and
booster
vaccination),
initial
vaccine,
booster,
and
future
vaccine
intent,
feeling
informed
about
the
COVID-[ADDRESS_240804]
demographic
information
in
the
baseline
survey,

including
age,
race,
ethnicity,
gender,
zip
code,
duration
of
experience
in
long-term
care,
educational
attainment,
health
literacy,
COVID-19
vaccine
status,
perceived
influence
of
others,
and
religiosity.
Our
primary,
secondary,
and
exploratory
outcomes
will
be
collected
by

and
some
loss
of
protection
as
the
virus
mutates,
coverage
rates
need
to
exceed
90%
[ADDRESS_240811],
and
lead
to
vaccine
hesitancy
7–11
.
Some
subgroups
of
the
US
population,
including
long-term
care
workers
(LTCWs),
have
higher
rates
of
COVID-[ADDRESS_240812]
vulnerable
to
serious
complications
of
COVID-19
14
.
LTCWs
are
also
likely
to
be
more
vulnerable
to
complications
of
COVID-19
themselves.
More
than
50%
of
LTCWs
are
from
minority
and
socioeconomically
disadvantaged
groups,
often
working
multiple
jobs
15,16
.
Given
the
vulnerability
of
the
populations
they
serve,
the
possibility
of
transmission
in
their
local
communities,
and
their
own
increased
risk
of
COVID-19
morbidity/mortality,
it
is
important
to
increase
COVID-[ADDRESS_240813]
2021,
the
US
Federal
Government
announced
its
intent
to
impose
a
mandate
that
LTCWs
be
vaccinated
in
order
to
be
eligible
to
work.
This
mandate
has
now
been
expanded
to
include
employees
in
all
health
facilities
that
receive
federal
funding.
The
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
(CMS),
working
with
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
11
(CDC),
will
be
responsible
for
imposing
the
broad
mandate
and
planned
to
release
an
interim
rule
in
October
2021.
While
vaccine
mandates
have
clear,
positive
implications
for
reducing
COVID-[ADDRESS_240814]
on
relationships
at
work
and
the
wellbeing
of
long-term
care
workers.
These
consequences
highlight
the
importance
of
eﬀorts
to
increase
conﬁdence
in
the
COVID-19
vaccines,
so
decisions
to
vaccinate
are
made
willingly.
Increasing
vaccine
conﬁdence
will
also
help
alleviate
the
concerns
of
those
already
vaccinated,
but
still
hesitant
to
follow
future
vaccination
recommendations.
Evidence
for
vaccine
conﬁdence
in
LTCWs
is
limited;

in

of

.
Other
evidence
indicates
that
social

interventions
can
improve
attitudes
towards
vaccines
and
increase

.
Lastly,
shared
decision-making
(SDM)
interventions
that
involve
patients
and
healthcare
providers
sharing
information
and
making
vaccine
decisions
collaboratively
have
also
been
shown
to
improve

Aims
and
Objectives
S p e c i ﬁ c
A i m
1
:
To
compare
the
impact
of
two
interventions
delivered
online:
1)
a
dialogue-based
webinar
using
the
existing
COVID-19
Option
Grid
conversation
aid
and,
2)
an
interactive,
dynamic,
and
multi-component
social
media
website,
compared
to
enhanced
usual
practice
(link
to
Centers
for
Disease
Control
(CDC)
vaccine
website),
on
COVID-19
vaccine
conﬁdence
(primary
outcome),
and
other
secondary
outcomes
among
LTCWs
(see
Figure
1).
H y p o t h e s i s
1 :
Each
intervention
will
be
superior
to
enhanced
usual
practice
at
increasing
vaccine
conﬁdence.
H y p o t h e s i s
2
:
The
dialogue-based
webinar
intervention
will
be
superior
to
the
social
media
arm
at
increasing
vaccine
conﬁdence.
We
predict
superiority
of
the
dialogue-based
webinar
intervention
based
on
stronger
evidence
that
exists
for
dialogue-based
approaches
and
SDM
for
improving
vaccine
hesitancy
and/or
uptake,
as
compared
to
social
media
approaches.
While
our
social
media
website
intervention
includes
elements
of
dialogue,
this
component
is
more
explicit
in
the
webinar
intervention
(see
‘Interventions
and
control’).
S p e c i ﬁ c

:
To
determine
if
LTCWs’
characteristics
and
other
factors
mediate
and
moderate
the
interventions’
impact
on
vaccine
conﬁdence
and
other
secondary
outcomes
(See
Figure

H y p o t h e s i s

:
Increased
perceptions
of
feeling
informed
about
the
vaccines,
identiﬁcation
of
vaccine
information
and
misinformation,
and
trust
in
vaccine
information
provided
by
[INVESTIGATOR_121732]ﬀerent
sources
will
explain
(mediate)
the
relationship
between
the
interventions
and
vaccine
conﬁdence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes.
E x p l o r a t o r y :
We
will
conduct
exploratory
heterogeneity
of
treatment
eﬀects
(HTE)
analyses
to
identify
whether
certain
participant
characteristics
and
beliefs
moderate
the
relationship
between
the
interventions
and
vaccine
conﬁdence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes.
13
Variables
to
be
explored
will
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
vaccination
status,
religious

We
are
undertaking
a

which
is
a
co-design

co-development
approach
to

.
In
Aim

we
hypothesized
that
this
co-development

approach
would
facilitate
implementation
of
the
interventions
in
both
the

will
primarily
involve

of
LTC
settings
in

(NRL),
who
has
extensive
professional
LTC
experience
and
trusted

retirement
communities
in
both

we
will
use
two
criteria
–
worry

–
to
screen
participants
for
eligibility.
These
criteria
are
based
on
a

We
designed
two
multi-component,
interactive,
online
interventions
(arms
1
and
2),
informed
by
[CONTACT_201920]ﬁdence
and
hesitancy
literature.
Notably,
our
intervention
development
and
hypothesized
mediators
(see
Figure
3)
were
initially
informed
by
[CONTACT_201921]-Watel’s
vaccine
hesitancy
framework,
which
conceptualizes
vaccine
decision-making
as
a
process.
The
framework
also
distinguishes
between
two
types
of
vaccine
hesitant
people:
1)
those
with
poor
knowledge
of
and/or
indiﬀerence
to
vaccination
issues,
and
2)
those
who
are
interested
in
vaccination
issues
and
seek
more
information,
yet
are
hesitant
38
.
We
were
also
informed
by
[CONTACT_201922]
“three
Cs”
of
vaccine
hesitancy:
Conﬁdence,
Complacency
and
Convenience;
and,
we
considered
all
three
Cs
39
.
Additionally,
our
interventions
were
informed
by
[CONTACT_201923],
which
suggests
multi-component,
dialogue-based
interventions
(such
as
conversation-based
and
social
media
interventions)
are
most
eﬀective,
as
well
as
those
tailored
for
speciﬁc
populations
22
.
The
interventions
were
co-designed,
co-adapted,
and
pre-tested
with
LTCWs
as
well
as
NAHCA,
IHI,
and
other
co-investigators.

44
.
We
also
developed
community
standards
to
ensure
all
participants
felt
welcome
and
comfortable
when
engaging
with
the
interventions.
These
standards,
which
are
similar
across
both
interventions,
were
based
on
the
rules
of
existing
vaccine
discussion
forums
and
were
co-created
with
our
LTCW
partners
44
.
Also
included
in
both
interventions
is
a

that
we
developed
featuring
LTC

voicing
their
views
on
why
it
is
important
for
LTCWs
to
be

An

will

be
delivered
to
all
participants
assigned
to
this
arm
one
week
prior
to
their
T2
survey
invitation
(see
Figure

The
refresher
will
be
an
email
with
a
link
to
COVID-[ADDRESS_240838]
(and
primarily
in
the
sustainability
phase),
we
will
collect
data
from
online
activity
data,
ﬁeld-notes,
and
observations
using
FRAME
(expanded
F
ramework
for
R
eporting
A
daptations
and
M
odiﬁcations
to
E
vidence-based
interventions)
48
.
According
to
the
FRAME,
an
adaptation
is
deﬁned
as
a
“process
of
thoughtful
and
deliberate
alteration
to
the
design
or
delivery
of
an
intervention,
with
the
goal
of
improving
its
ﬁt
or
eﬀectiveness
in
a
given
context”
[ADDRESS_240839]:
during
the
sustainability
phase
of
the
study.
Understanding
what,
how
and
when
adaptations
are
made
is
an
essential
aspect
of
implementation
science.
In
this
context,
adaptation
will
primarily
be
made
and
documented
during
the
sustainability
phase
(year
[ADDRESS_240840]).
Whereas
the
content
of
the
interventions
will
be
responsive
to
participant
engagement,
signiﬁcant
adaptations
to
format
and
delivery
during
the
randomized
controlled
trial
(years
01
and
02)
will
be
minimal
and
only
implemented
if
judged
essential
by
[CONTACT_201930].
These
adaptations
will
also
be
documented
using
the
FRAME
guidance.

were
selected
to

we
will
use
validated
short-form
questionnaires
when
possible.
Our
primary,

and
other
outcomes
will
be

via
web-based
electronic
surveys
at

across
three
domains:

Each
item
is
rated
on
a
5-point
scale
ranging
from
1
('Strongly

Participants
will
be
considered
'conﬁdent'
(score

if
they
respond
'Agree'
or
'Strongly

on
all
three

Using
historical
Vaccine
Conﬁdence
Index
(VCI)
data
70
and
current
vaccination
rates
71
,
a
VCI
threshold
was
determined
that
was
signiﬁcantly
correlated
with
rates
of
vaccination
(p=0.0001).
Assuming
the
analytic
approaches
outlined
in
sections
4.7.2
and
later,
the
sample
size
of
1,800
32
LTCWs
(600

provides
80%
power
to
detect
an
8%

in
the
rate
of
scores
above
this
threshold
between
groups
with
a
two-sided
test
at

rate
of

The
sample
size
is
suﬃcient
to

80%

to
detect
a
10%

(assuming

We
will
co-design
engaging

materials
with
our
stakeholder
partners,
including
brief
animated
videos
that
describe
the
study.
We
will
utilize
the
existing
networks
of
our
partner
organizations,
stakeholders,
and
consultants,
to
share
recruitment
messaging.
This
will
include
email
listservs
and
social
media
platforms
(e.g.,
Facebook
groups).
We
will
also
utilize
paid,
targeted
social

advertising
to
share
recruitment
messaging
on
various
platforms,
including
Facebook
and
Instagram,
among
other
platforms.
Lastly,
we
will
utilize
in-person
recruitment
which
will
include
sharing
recruitment
materials
during
visits
to
LTC
settings,
conferences,
and
other
events,
and
outreach
to

Recruitment
messaging
(i.e.,
emails,
social

will
include
links
to:
1)
a

can
learn
more
about
the
study
via
brief,
plain-language

,
and,
2)
a
Qualtrics
survey
where
they
can
proceed
straight
to

Screening
will
involve
prospective

answering
a
series
of

to
self-assess
their

is
included
in
Appendix
B.
For
Aim
1,
hypothesis
1.1,
we
will
conduct
one-tailed
tests
(superiority
analysis)
to
compare
the
impact
of
each
of
the
two
intervention
arms
against
the
enhanced
usual
practice
arm
on
primary
and
secondary
outcomes.
For
Aim
1,
hypothesis
1.2,
we
will
conduct
a
two-tailed
test
(equivalence
analysis)
of
primary
and
secondary
outcomes
between
the
two
intervention
arms.
While
we
hypothesize
that
the
dialogue-based
webinar
intervention
(Arm
1)
will
be
superior
to
the
social
media
website
intervention
(Arm
2),
a
ﬁnding
of
superiority,
inferiority,
or
no
distinguishable
diﬀerence
will
be
a
valuable
ﬁnding.
For
Aim
2,
hypothesis
2.1,
our
mediation
analyses
seek
to
identify
the
relationship
between
the
interventions,
mediator
variables,
and
primary
and
secondary
outcomes.
We
are
interested
in
whether
interventions
operate
through
the
mediator
rather
than
directly
aﬀecting
the
outcome.

hypothesis
2.2,
our
exploratory
moderation
analyses
(also
referred
to
as
heterogeneity
of
treatment
eﬀects
(HTE)
analyses)
seek
to
understand
whether
certain
participant
characteristics
and
beliefs
inﬂuence
the
relationship
between
the
interventions
and
vaccine
conﬁdence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes.
We
will
explore
moderators
including
(but
not
limited
to)
vaccination
status,
religious
beliefs,
age,
race,
ethnicity,
perceived
inﬂuence
of
others,
and
personal
experiences
with
COVID-19.
Because
of
the
size,
scope,
and
complexity
of
this
study,
exploratory
analyses
of
relationships
within
the
data
will
be
conducted
to
identify
factors
to
inform
future
analysis
(see

Exploratory,

This
will
include
setting

To
reduce
the
duration
that
identifying
information
will
be
linked
to
other
study
data,
at
the
completion
of
data
collection,
we
will
download
all
data
that
was
collected
and
stored
in
cloud-based
systems
and
set
up
crosswalks
for
each
of
the
downloaded
datasets.
We
will
do
the
same
for
any
local
ﬁles
used
in
the
process
of
participant
management,
such
as
tracking
spreadsheets.
The
crosswalks
will
utilize
a
unique
and
anonymous
‘Study
ID’
variable
and
identiﬁable
variable
ﬁelds
depending
on
the
data
source.
We
will
set
up
a
master
key
ﬁle
that
will
include
only
Study
ID
and
all
identiﬁable
variable
ﬁelds.
This
key
ﬁle
will
be
used
for
all
data
crosswalks.
The
master
key
ﬁle
will
be
stored
separately
to
the
other
study
data
in
the
secure
SharePoint
cloud
system
as
well
as
on
one
or
more
encrypted
and
password-protected
external
hard
drives.
Remaining
deidentiﬁed
datasets
will
include
the
Study
ID
variable,
which
will
be
the
only
link
between
them
and
the
identiﬁable
study
data.
The
only
exception
to
this
de-identiﬁcation
and
crosswalk
process
is
the
video
and
audio
recordings
of
webinar
intervention
sessions,
as
these
will
be
needed
for
process
evaluation
analyses
which
will
continue
past
data
collection
completion.
It
is
not
possible
to
create
crosswalks
and
remove
identifying
information
from
participant
data
prior
to
data
collection
completion,
as
many
of
our
cloud-based
systems
and
participant
management
processes
require
the
identifying
information
for
our
study
to
function
correctly
(e.g.,
Salesforce
for
participant
communication;
study
website
to
manage
user
registrations
and
notiﬁcations;
question
responses
cannot
be
deleted
from
active
Qualtrics
survey
datasets,
Zoom
video/audio
recordings
for
process
evaluation).
We
will
also
need
to
create
weekly
back-ups
of
all
data
contained
in
Salesforce
(including
identiﬁers)
to
ensure
we
are
protected
in
the
event
of
any
data
loss.
At
the
completion
of
data
collection
and
following
the
downloading
of
data
from
cloud-based
systems,
we
will
delete
all
participant

in
cloud-based
systems
(excluding
SharePoint)
by

involvement
in
the
trial
(
see
DSMB
Charter).
The
DSMB
will

Executive
Secretary
with
experience
in
SDM
research
The
DSMB
will
operate
independently
from
the
study
sponsor
and
funder.
Independence
is
essential
to
ensure
that
the
DSMB
members
are
objective
and
capable
of
an
unbiased
assessment
of
the
study's
safety
and
eﬃcacy
of
data.
No
members
of
the
DSMB
should
have
ﬁnancial,
proprietary,
professional
or
other
interests
that
may
aﬀect
impartial
decision
making
by
[CONTACT_201949].
The
following
will
ensure
the
independence
of
the
DSMB:
●
Members
of
the
DSMB
will
not
participate
as
investigators
in
the
study
under
review.
●
Members
of
the
DSMB
must
not
have
a
direct
interest
in
knowing
or
inﬂuencing
trial
outcomes
or
have
a
ﬁnancial,
proprietary,
or
intellectual
interest
in
the
outcomes
of
the
study
under
review.
●
DSMB
members
must
disclose
all
potential
new
conﬂicts
of
interests
(COIs).
The
DSMB
will
review
the
protocol,
data
collected,
and
advise
the
PIs
on
any
potential
risks
and
risk
mitigation
plans.
The
DSMB
recommendations
will
be
discussed
with
the
PIs
as
well
43
as
the
Trial
Steering
Group,
which
meets
quarterly.
The
Trial
Steering
Group
will
consider
all
DSMB
recommendations
and
revise
relevant
aspects
of
the
trial
accordingly.
Those
recommendations
will
also
be
fed
back
to
PCORI
annually
as
part
of
the
progress
reports.
The
PIs
will
also
be
responsible
for
sending
a
summary
of
DSMB
recommendations
to
the
Dartmouth
CPHS
(IRB)
after
each
DSMB
meeting.
If
there
are
adverse
or
unanticipated
events/problems

require
reporting,
PCORI
and
the
CPHS
will
be
notiﬁed
within
a
day
of
the
DSMB
meeting.
If
there
are
no
adverse
or
unanticipated
events/problems
that
require
reporting,
DSMB
meeting
minutes
and
recommendations
will
be
communicated
to
PCORI
in
the
interim
progress
report
.
Trial
activity
will
also
be
monitored
by
[CONTACT_201950],
outside
of
annual
DSMB
meetings.
We
believe
the
likelihood
of
Serious
Adverse
Events
(SAEs)
in
the
trial
that
would
require
immediate
reporting
to
be
extremely
low,
as
there
are
no
invasive
procedures
related
to
the
interventions.
However,
it
is
possible
that
a
participant
may
experience
psychological
discomfort
or
distress
as
a
result
of
answering
certain
survey
questions
or
through
engagement
in
either
of
the
two
study
interventions.
All
potential
adverse
events
or
unanticipated
events/problems,
regardless
of
their
severity,
will
be
reported
to
the
PIs.
All
events
will
be
discussed
by
[CONTACT_201951],
and
a
determination
will
be
made
as
to
whether
they
constitute
Reportable
New
Information
(e.g.,
it
increases
the
risk
to
subjects;
a
subject
experienced
unexpected
harm).
Any
event
deemed
to
be
Reportable
New
Information
will
be
reported
to
Dartmouth
CPHS
(IRB)
and
the
DSMB
will
convene
urgently
and
review
the
event
in
question.
[ADDRESS_240866]

P ar ticipants
In
the
ﬁnal
study
survey,
we
will
ascertain
participants’
preferences
for
receiving
(via
email
or
mail)
information
on
the
study’s
ﬁndings.
Once
all
study
data
are
collected
and
analyzed,
we
will
begin
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]
a
pi[INVESTIGATOR_201897],
methods,
and
key
ﬁndings.
Information
on
study
results
in
the
ﬁnal
lay
summary
will
be
emailed
via
the
email
address
participants
provided
at
the
outset
of
the
study
or
directly
mailed
to
the
study
participants
if
that
is
their
preference.
The
email
will
also
contain
a
link
to
the
full
results
publication
online
as
well
as
the
study
website,
which
will
contain
additional
information
about
the
study
and
its
dissemination
eﬀorts.
For
participants
who
chose
to
receive
the
summary
in
the
mail,
we
will
send
a
copy
of
the
published
manuscript
to
them
as
well.
In
addition
to
direct
communication
of
aggregate
study
results
via
email
or
mail,
participants
may
also
become
aware
of
study
results
via
the
broader

*Data
on

will
be
collected
via
a
combination
of
online
activity
data
and
participant
survey
questions
Statistical
principles
Confidence
intervals
and
p-values
P-values
≥0.0001
will
be
reported
to
4
decimal
places;
p-values
less
than
0.0001
will
be
reported
as
“<0.0001”.
The
mean,
standard
deviation,
and
any
other
statistics
other
than
quantiles,
will
be
reported
to
one
decimal
place
greater
than
the
original
data.
Quantiles,
such
as
median,
minimum,
or
maximum
will
use
the
same
number
of
decimal
places
as
the
original
data.
Estimated
parameters,
not
on
the
same
scale
as
raw
observations
(e.g.
regression
coefficients)
will
be
reported
to
3
significant
figures.
Adherence
to
interventions
Analysis
of
both
intention-to-treat
(ITT)
and
as-treated
populations
will
be
performed.
All
participants
who
are
randomized
to
a
trial
arm
will
be
included
in
the
ITT
analyses.
Participants
who
adhere
to
major
engagement
criteria
for
their
primary
intervention
will
be
included
in
the
as-treated
analyses.
Analysis
methodology
Aim
[ADDRESS_240877]
of
two
interventions
delivered
online:
1)
a
dialogue-based
webinar
(webinar)
using
the
existing
COVID-19
Option
Grid
conversation
aid
and,
2)
an
interactive
and,
dynamic,
and
multi-component
social
media
web
application
(social
media
website),
compared
to
enhanced
usual
practice
(link
to
Centers
for
Disease
Control
(CDC)
vaccine
website),
on
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
(primary
outcome),
and
other
secondary
outcomes
among
LTCWs.
We
hypothesize
that
each
intervention
will
be
superior
to
enhanced
usual
practice
at
increasing
vaccine
confidence
(
Hypothesis
1.1
)
and
that
the
dialogue-based
webinar
intervention
will
be
superior
to
the
social
media
arm
at
increasing
vaccine
confidence
(
Hypothesis
1.2
).

Secondary
outcomes
●
Change
from
baseline
in
COVID-19
Vaccine
Confidence.
Analysis
of
change
from
60
baseline
will
be
based
on
a
binary
classifier
whether
the
average
score
increases
(1)
or
does
not
increase
(2)
at
T1,
T2,
and
T3
versus
baseline.
●
Likelihood
of
recommending
COVID-19
vaccination
(others
not
vaccinated).
This
question
will
be
evaluated
using
a
Net
Promoter
Score
(NPS)
approach,
adding
one
for
each
positive
response,
zero
for
neutral,
and
subtracting
one
for
each
negative
response,
then
dividing
by
[CONTACT_201958]-missing
responses
for
each
trial
arm.
NPS
values
will
be
compared
using
Wald
intervals
[1].
●
Likelihood
of
recommending
COVID-19
booster
vaccination
(coworker).
This
question
will
be
evaluated
using
the
NPS
approach,
described
above.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
uptake
(any
dose).
This
will
be
evaluated
as
a
binary
classifier
compared
across
trial
arms
using
two-proportion
z-tests.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
uptake
(initial
series
completion).
For
participants
who
have
received
any
dose
of
a
COVID-19
vaccine,
this
will
be
evaluated
as
a
binary
classifier
compared
across
trial
arms
using
two-proportion
z-tests.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
uptake
(booster
completion).
For
participants
who
have
completed
their
initial
vaccine
series,
this
will
be
evaluated
as
a
three
category
variable
(No,
Not
sure,
Yes)
compared
across
trial
arms
using
chi-squared
tests.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
intent
(initial
series)
.
For
participants
who
are
unvaccinated,
we
will
assess
their
intentions
of
getting
a
COVID-19
vaccine,
this
will
be
evaluated
using
the
Net
Promoter
Score
approach,
where
the
three
responses
–
Yes,
Not
Sure,
No
–
will
be
evaluated
as
analogous
to
promoter,
neutral,
and
detractor,
respectively.
The
question
will
be
evaluated
using
the
NPS
analysis,
described
above.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
intent
(booster)
.
For
participants
who
have
completed
an
initial
vaccine
series,
this
will
be
evaluated
using
the
Net
Promoter
Score
approach,
where
the
three
responses
–
Yes,
Not
Sure,
No
–
will
be
evaluated
as
analogous
to
promoter,
neutral,
and
detractor,
respectively.
The
question
will
be
evaluated
using
the
NPS
analysis,
described
above.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
intent
(future
vaccine
recommendations).
Participants’
intent
to
get
COVID-19
vaccines
regularly
in
the
future
if
they
are
recommended
will
be
evaluated
using
the
Net
Promoter
Score
approach,
where
the
three
responses
–
Yes,
Not
Sure,
No
–
will
be
evaluated
as
analogous
to
promoter,
neutral,
and
detractor,
respectively.
The
question
will
be
evaluated
using
the
NPS
analysis,
described
above.
●
Feeling
informed
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
The
degree
to
which
participants’
feel
informed
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines
(have
enough
information
and
understand
that
information)
will
be
evaluated
using
a
continuous
variable,
calculated
as
the
mean
scale
61
score
across
two
items
((1)
having
enough
information,
(2)
understanding
the
information)
for
each
participant.
The
mean
of
all
mean
scores
will
be
compared
across
trial
arms
with
two-sample
unpaired
t-tests.
●
Identification
of
COVID-19
vaccine
information
and
misinformation.
Subjects’
identification
of
COVID-19
vaccine
information
and
misinformation
will
be
scored
on
a
scale
of
zero
to
four
and
treated
as
a
continuous
linear
variable.
Results
will
be
compared
across
trial
arms
with
two
sample
unpaired
t-tests.
●
Trust
in
COVID-19
information
from
different
sources.
Subjects’
trust
in
COVID-19
information
from
different
sources
will
be
evaluated
using
a
continuous
variable,
calculated
as
the
mean
scale
score
across
three
items
for
each
participant.
The
mean
of
all
mean
scores
will
be
compared
across
trial
arms
with
two-sample
unpaired
t-tests.
●
Change
from
baseline
in
secondary
outcomes.
Change
from
baseline
will
be
scored
as
a
binary
variable
with
an
increased
value
scored
as
one
and
a
no
change
or
decreased
value
scored
as
zero.
For
each
evaluation
after
baseline,
each
arm
will
be
compared
using
two-proportion
z-tests.
For
vaccine
and
booster
intent
questions,
where
the
intent
question
is
not
repeated
if
the
participant
indicates
an
increase
in
vaccination
status,
intent
will
be
imputed
from
uptake.
To
be
clear,
an
individual
who
is
unvaccinated
at
T0,
then
returns
at
T1
and
indicates
that
he
or
she
is
now
vaccinated,
will
be
presented
with
the
vaccine
intent
question
at
T0
but
not
at
T1.
Because
the
individual
is
now
vaccinated,
asking
about
vaccine
intent
at
T1
would
be
confusing.
For
analyzing
change
in
vaccine
intent,
the
individual
whose
vaccine
status
increases
would
be
considered
to
have
positive
intent
at
T1.
A
similar
approach
will
be
used
for
booster
intent.
●
As
treated
analysis
of
primary
and
secondary
outcomes.
Primary
and
secondary
outcome
analyses
will
be
repeated,
limited
to
the
as
treated
samples.
Aim
2
To
determine
if
LTCWs’
characteristics
and
other
factors
mediate
and
moderate
the
interventions’
impact
on
vaccine
confidence
and
other
secondary
outcomes.
We
hypothesize
that
increased
perceptions
of
feeling
informed
about
the
vaccines,
identification
of
vaccine
information
and
misinformation,
and
trust
in
vaccine
information
provided
by

(mediate)
the
relationship
between
the
interventions
and
vaccine
confidence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes
(
Hypothesis
2.1)
.
We
will
also
conduct
exploratory
heterogeneity
of
treatment
effects
(HTE)
analyses
to
identify
whether
certain
participant
characteristics
and
beliefs
moderate
the
relationships
among
each
of
the
interventions
and
vaccine
confidence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes.
Variables
to
be
explored
will
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
baseline
vaccination
status,
religious
beliefs,
perceived
influence
of
others,
age,
race,
ethnicity
and
personal
experiences
with
COVID-19.

Corresponding
analyses
Mediation
analysis
We
hypothesize
that
the
relationship
between
participants’
assigned
trial
arm
and
primary
and
secondary
outcomes
will
be
mediated
by
[CONTACT_201960],
trust
in
vaccine
information,
and
beliefs
about
vaccines
(measured
through
questions
to
determine
each
participant’s
ability
to
correctly
classify
vaccine
information
and
misinformation).
Responses
for
these
three
variables
will
be
evaluated
at
each
time
point
versus
outcomes
by
[CONTACT_201961]-Wallis
test.
Significant
relationships
will
be
explored
for
mediation
effects
in
the
primary
and
secondary
outcome
analyses
using
the
method
of
Barron
and
Kenny
[2].
If
this
results
in
a
significant
improvement
in
model
prediction,
hypothesis
2.1
will
be
supported.

Vaccine
Confidence.
Looking
deeper
at
the
change
in
vaccine
confidence,
analyses
will
consider
(a)
the
proportion
of
positive

responses
in
the
VCI,
(b)
positive

in
each
of
the

questions.
Significant

contextual,
and

variables
will
be
evaluated.
External
contextual
factors
.
Outside
of
the
study
surveys
and
throughout
the
trial,
we
will
monitor
external
factors
that
may
impact
participants’
views
and
actions
towards
the
COVID-[ADDRESS_240879]
complete
a
baseline
(T0)
survey
to
be
considered
enrolled
in
the
study.
In
the
event
of
duplicate
complete
T0
submissions,
the
first
complete
survey
will
be
used.
For
participants
who
complete
duplicate
follow-up
surveys
(T1,
T2
or
T3),
the
first
complete
survey
[ADDRESS_240880]
valid
primary
outcome
data
at
both
T0
and
T1.
The
study
team
will
endeavor
to
minimize
missing
data;
however,
it
is
possible
that
efforts
to
ensure
complete
data
collection
within
the
response
windows
will
be
unsuccessful
or
because
participants
may
choose
not
to
respond
to
one
or
more
questions.
Should
any
primary
and/or
secondary
outcome
variables
have
>5%
missing
data,
the
reasons
for
any
missing
data
will
be
considered
through
an
analysis
for
common
baseline
characteristics
of
individuals
with
specific
responses
missing,
those
who
were
lost
to
follow-up,
and
those
who
did
not
respond
to
one
or
more
evaluations
but
were
not
lost
to
follow-up.
Specific
questions
with
significantly
higher
rates
of
missing
data
will
be
reviewed
for
wording
bias
or
missing
response
options.
Based
on
these
considerations,
a
stochastic
outcome
set
model
will
be
created
using
multiple
imputation
and
Bayesian
methods,
as
appropriate,
to
provide
a
high
confidence
range
for
imputed
values.
Using
this
approach,
an
expected
result
and
confidence
intervals
will
be
produced
for
the
missing
data
and
the
resulting
analysis
of
the
full
data
set,
taking
into
account
the
statistical
uncertainty
attributed
to
the
missing
data.
If
available,
data
from
both
baseline
and
subsequent
follow-up
evaluations
will
be
used
in
imputing
missing
results
(e.g.,
responses
from
T0
and
T2
evaluations
could
be
used
to
impute
T1
responses)
through
multiple
imputation
regression
modeling
[ 3].
Response
rates
and
the
frequency
of
missing
data
in
the
ITT
and
as-treated
populations
will
be
reported
with
the
results.
Fraudulent
enrollment
Identity
verification
of
some
participants
will
occur
after
they
have
completed
their
journey
in
the
study
(using
TransUnion’s
TLOxp
veriﬁcation
service
).
We
will
also
conduct
a
rigorous
review
of
survey
metadata
(e.g.,
IP
addresses)
and
other
responses
to
identify
duplicate
survey
completions
or
other
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_201902]
[4,5].
Upon
discovery
of
compelling
evidence
of
fraudulent
or
illegitimate
enrollment,
such
subjects
will
be
excluded
from
the
study
prior
to
any
outcome
analyses.
Methods
to
minimize
bias
A
naïve
analysis
will
be
conducted
at
the
end
of
the
study
based
only
on
the
unmodified
data
reflecting
ITT
assignments
of
eligible
subjects
to
establish
an
initial
estimator.
All
primary
and
secondary
analyses
will
be
conducted
based
on
the
statistical
analysis
plan.
The
statistician
member
of
the
DSMB
will
also
independently
replicate
primary
study
analyses
to
confirm
their
validity.
Multiple
testing
The
primary
outcome
involves
three
separate
tests,
one
a
two-tailed
equivalence
test
and
two
one-tailed
superiority
tests.
In
order
to
achieve
a
family-wise
error
rate
less
than
0.050,
the
Bonferroni
method
was
employed
to
set
a
p-value
threshold
at
0.016
for
each
of
the
three
primary
outcome
analyses.
For
each
comparison,
mean-value
separation
will
be
considered

on
a

confidence
interval,
which

Study Duration  Excluding the Screening Period (up to 28 days in duration), subjects will 
participate in this study for up to 57  ± 7 days. 
During the Treatment Period, study drug (VX -661/IVA or placebo) will be 
administered for 29 ± 3 days. A Safety Follow -Up Visit is required for all subjects 
28 ± [ADDRESS_1153640] dose of study drug.  
  
Study Design  This is a Phase  2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
multicenter, exploratory study in subjects with CF who are homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation.  
This study includes a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and a Safety Follow -
up Visit. 
Screening Period (Day  −28 through Day −1): 
The Screening Period will occur between [ADDRESS_1153641] dose of 
study drug to confirm that the subjects meet the eligibility criteria.  
 
During the Screening Period, a patency capsule and a wireless motility capsule 
(WMC) will be administered.  The patency capsule will be administered at the 
Day -[ADDRESS_1153642] will occur 2 days after 
administration of the patency capsule to confirm the pa ssage of the capsule in the 
stool (unless the subject confirms the passage of the capsule prior to the scheduled telephone contact). Subjects who are unable to successfully pass the patency 
capsule test will not be randomized.  
 
The WMC will be  administered  at the Day -[ADDRESS_1153643] will occur 5 
days after administration of the WMC to confirm the passage of the capsule (unless the subject confirms the passage of the caps ule prior to the scheduled 
telephone contact). The subject will not be randomized in the study until passage 
of the WMC has been confirmed by [CONTACT_831231] X -ray, regardless of 
confirmation of passage by [CONTACT_831232].  
Treatment Period (Day  1 through Day 29 ± 3 days): 
On Day 1, subjects will be randomized (4:1) to VX -661/IVA combination therapy 
(100-mg VX-661 qd/150- mg IVA every 12 hours [q12h]) or placebo  
Safety Follow -up Visit (28  ± [ADDRESS_1153644] dose of study drug)  
The Safety Follow -up Visit is required for all subjects 28  ± [ADDRESS_1153645] 
dose of study drug. Subjects who complete the Day  29 Visit and subsequently the 
Safety Follow -up Visit will be offered the opportunity to enroll into an extension 
study of V X-661/IVA combination therapy if they meet eligibility requirements 
for the extension study.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an orphan disease1,[ADDRESS_1153669] morbidity and mortality 
are caused by [CONTACT_831238], the disease affects multiple organs.6 
CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by [CONTACT_831239] (CFTR), an epi[INVESTIGATOR_831209]-dependent protein kinase A that is responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues.
4 This function is 
defective in patients with CF due to a loss of either cell surface expression and/or function. 
The most prevalent mutation is an in -frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR). The proportion of patients 
with CF who are homozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation is similar across geographic 
regions: approximately 47% in the US,7 44% in the European Union (EU),8 49% in Canada,9 and 
52% in Australia.[ADDRESS_1153670] been studied.
17 One approach is to treat with a compound (CFTR “correctors”) 
that will modify the cellular processing and trafficking of the CFTR protein to increase the amount of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Another approach is to treat with compounds (“potentiators”) that increase the channel gating activity of protein kinase A- activated CFTR at 
the cell surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity in the membrane and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required to ameliorate lung disease in patients with CF. A modest restoration of chloride secretion through the action of a 

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 18 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   potentiator and/or corrector could prevent the hyperabsorption of water across the api[INVESTIGATOR_831210], allowing proper maintenance of airway hydration. Restoration of adequate airway hydration could alleviate the cycle of mucus plugging, infection, and inflammation, 
which leads to irreversible structural changes in the lungs and, eventually, respi[INVESTIGATOR_315404].  
VX-661 is a compound developed by [CONTACT_831240] (Vertex) that has 
been shown to have CFTR corrector properties. Several lines of in vitro evidence suggest that VX-661 works by [CONTACT_139370] a fraction of F508del-CFTR protein during its biogenesis and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing it to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and traffic to the cell surface.
18 When added for 
more than 24 hours to human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells isolated and cultured from lung explants obtained from donors with CF (CF-HBE cells) who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, a concentration- dependent increase in levels of mature (i.e.,  plasma 
membrane) F508del -CFTR was observed. The increased trafficking of F508del- CFTR to the cell 
surface resulted in a substantial increase in Cl
− secretion.[ADDRESS_1153671] the 
processing and localization of other misfolded or normally folded proteins other than CFTR, suggesting that the mechanism of VX -661 action is selective for CFTR (CFTR corrector).
19 
Ivacaftor (IVA, VX -770; Kalydeco [150-mg tablets]) is a compound developed by [CONTACT_831241]. Proof of concept that pharmacologic 
modulation of CFTR function can result in clinical benefit in patients with CF was observed in subjects with CF and the G551D-CFTR mutation who had robust clinical improvement following 
administration of IVA .
20 Kalydeco is currently indicated for treatment of CF in a subset of 
patients with Class  III or “gating” CFTR mutations, including the G551D- CFTR mutation.  
Details about the VX -661 and IVA development programs can be found in the Investigator's 
Brochures.21,22

8 STUDY DESIGN 
8.1 Overview of Study Desig n 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, 
exploratory study in subjects with CF who are homozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation. 
This study is designed to evaluate the lung function and extrapulmonary responses of subjects receiving VX -661/IVA combination therapy. 
This study includes a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and a Safety Follow-up Visit. The study plans to randomize approximately 35 subjects and up to approximately 45 subjects. Subjects will be randomized (4:1) to VX-661/IVA or placebo, respectively, as shown in Figure 8-1.  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment will be asked to complete 
assessments as described in Section 8.1.4. 
Subjects who complete the Treatment Period and are eligible and elect to roll into an extension study will be required to have a Safety Follow- up visit 28 ± [ADDRESS_1153672] dose of study 
drug.

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.[ADDRESS_1153673] (see the 
Study Reference Manu al for additional information).  
To allow flexibility, the Clinic Visit Day  -23 to Day -10 may occur on 1 day or on 2 separate 
days as follows (see Table 3-1):   
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_831211].  
• If WMC administration and MCC occur on a single day, spi[INVESTIGATOR_831212], and WMC administration should occur before MCC.  
• A urine pregnancy test will be completed  before WMC administration and the MCC; if 
WMC administration and MCC occur on 2 separate days, pregnancy testing will occur 
before the procedures on each day .  
• If assessments occur on 2 separate days, a meal or snack bar will be provided at the clinic 
on both days. 
• Fasting will occur only on the day of WMC administration. 
Subjects will be outpatients during the Screening Period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Repetition of individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria is not 
permitted with the following exceptions: 
• If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g.,  hemolyzed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collec tion of a repeat sample for the appropriate laboratory test or assessment 
may be permitted with the approval of the medical monitor.  
• Exclusionary liver function test (LFT) levels, which may be retested within 14 days of the 
original screening date.  
• If screening spi[INVESTIGATOR_489359]/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_139600],23 repeat 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_94230], after discussion with the medical monitor. 
If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) described above are within the eligibility criteria 
and completed within the screening window, then the subject will be eligible for the study, provided they meet all eligibility criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening  
Subjects may only be rescreened with the approval of the medical monitor. If a subject is rescreened, all Screening Visit (Day  -28 to Day - 13) assessments will be repeated except for the 
following: 
• Patency capsule assessment  
• Ophthalmology examination (if performed within the last 3 months) 
• CF genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_831213]14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 23 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   8.1.3 Safety Follow- up Visit 
The Safety Follow -up Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-2. The Safety F ollow-up Visit will 
occur approximately 28  (± 7) days after the last dose of study drug for all subjects, including 
subjects who discontinue treatment (see Section 8.1.4).  
Subjects who complete the Day 29 Visit and subsequently the Safety Follow- up Visit will be 
offered the opportunity to enroll into an extension study of VX-661/IVA combination therapy if 
they meet eligibility requirements for the extension study.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_1153674] prematurely discontinues study treatment, an Early Treatment Termination Visit (ETT) should be scheduled as soon as possible after the last dose of study drug. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow -up Visit, 
approximately 28 (± 7) days after their last dose of study drug. The assessments performed at the 
ETT and Safety Follow- up Visit are listed in  Table 3-2. 
If the ETT Visit occurs [ADDRESS_1153675]. 
This study is designed to observe the effects of VX -661 (100 mg  daily [qd]) and IVA 
(150 mg every 12 hours [q12h]) combination therapy on lung function (measured by [CONTACT_66763]
1 and 
MCC), gastrointestinal pH, and CFTR modulation (sweat chloride). These data will be 
informative for understanding the underlying clinical mechanisms of physiological 
improvements derived from CFTR modulation. 
8.2.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration 
The dose regimen of VX-661 for this study is equivalent to the dose evaluating VX-661/IVA 
combination ther apy in a Phase 2 study, Study VX11-661-101 (Study 101), and is the same dose 
selected for the Phase 3 studies.21 The dose regimen of 100- mg VX-661 qd/ 150 mg  IVA q12h 
provided clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in ppFEV 1 in 
Study 101 with 28 days of treatment in subjects ho mozygous for the F508del -CFTR mutation. In 
addition, a trend of decreased sweat chloride levels was observed with VX-661/IVA combination therapy at multiple dose levels investigated in Study 101 in subjects heterozygous and homozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation.
21Finally, in a separate study evaluating IVA 
monotherapy in patients with the G551D-CFTR mutation, improvements were observed within 1 month in both ppFEV1 and MCC, as well as in gastrointestinal pH as measured by [CONTACT_831242].
24 
Based on the timing of these treatment effects in those studies , a 4-week placebo -controlled 
duration was considered adequate. 
8.2.3 Rationale for Study Population 
The study population will be subjects with CF who are 18 years of age and older and are 
homozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation. The F508del- CFTR mutation interferes with the 
processing and trafficking of the CFTR protein, resulting in decreased chloride transport.18,19 In 

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 24 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Study 101, subjects homozygous for F508del- CFTR who were treated with VX -661/IVA 
combination therapy had statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in 
ppFEV 1, supporting the further development of VX-661/IVA combination therapy.21 The 
baseline characteristics of the population to be enrolled in this study are anticipated to be similar to the subset of subjects aged 18 years and older in the Phase 3 study (Study VX14-661-106) of 
VX-661/IVA combination therapy in subjects homozygous for F508del- CFTR. 
8.2.4 Rationale for Study Assessments 
The rationale for all efficacy assessments, including those related to lung function (ppFEV1), MCC, gastrointestinal pH, and sweat chloride, is provided below. Given the complexity and duration required to complete these assessments, clinical visits have been extended over multiple days within the screening and treatment periods. The safety assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in d rug development. The pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment ( Section 11.3) is 
included to assess exposure to study drug. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_831214] -661/IVA combination therapy on lung function, ppFEV 1 will be 
assessed as a measure of air flow in the lungs. Since lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with CF, CF lung disease is the desired primary target of VX -661/IVA 
combination therapy. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_831215]. 
MCC 
Mucus clearance is an innate airway defense mechanism for clearing bacteria and viruses, which is dependent on adequate airway surface hydration. It is hypothesized that patients with CF have defects in airway hydration, which in turn slows mucus clearance and promotes airway obstruction and subsequent infection. In a study evaluating IVA monotherapy in patients with the 
G551D-CFTR mutation, improvements were observed in both ppFEV
[ADDRESS_1153676] of VX -661/IVA combination therapy on 
MCC will also be assessed in this study using an imaging technique that enables the tracking of mucus within the airways.  
Gastrointestinal pH  
In addition to studying effects in the pulmonary system, and given that CFTR transports bicarbonate and chlori de, the effect of VX -661/IVA combination therapy on gastrointestinal pH 
will be assessed. Efficient neutralization of gastric acid in the proximal portion of the small intestine is an important factor in optimal nutrient absorption and digestion. Patients with CF have reduced bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas and gastrointestinal mucosa,
25, 26,27 and a 
more acidic small intestinal milieu as compared with healthy controls,28 resulting in increased 
mucus viscosity, inefficient pancreatic enzyme activity and  malnutrition. In a study evaluating 
IVA monotherapy in patients with the G551D-CFTR mutation, IVA treatment results in 
improvement in the pH of the small bowel, as measured using an ingested capsule device (a WMC).
[ADDRESS_1153677] of VX -661/IVA combination therapy on bicarbonate secretion 
will also be assessed in this study using gastrointestinal pH as determined by a WMC.

10 STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT  
Study drug refers to VX -661/IVA, IVA, and their matching placebos. 
10.1 Preparation and Dispensing  
Study drug may be dispensed only under the supervision of the investigator or an authorized 
designee and only for administration to the study subjects. 
10.2 Administration  
Study drug tablets will be administered orally during the Treatment Period as shown in 
Table 10-1. 
Table 10-1 Study Drug Administration - Treatment Period  
Treatment Arm  Time Drug(s) and Dose(s) Administered  
Route of Administration

AM: morning; FDC: fixed dose combination; IVA: ivacaftor; PM: evening.  
Study drug should be administered within 30 minutes of starting a meal with fat-containing food 
such as a “standard CF” high -fat, high- calorie meal or snack according to the following 
guidelines: 
1. Throughout the Treatment Period, study drugs will be administered after the start and before 
the end of a meal. It is recommended that the duration of each meal associated with study drug intake (i.e., breakfast and dinner/snack, as applicable) should not exceed 30 minutes.  
2. Study drug should be administered q12h (± 2 hours). For each subject, all doses (morning and evening) of study drugs will be taken at approximately the same time each day. For example, the morning dose could be taken at 08:00 every morning and the evening dose could be taken at 20:[ADDRESS_1153698] 's scheduled visit is  to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used: 
• If the dose in the clinic will be within [ADDRESS_1153699]'s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject should withhold their morning dose of study drug and the morning dose will 
be administered in the clinic.  
• If the dose in the clinic will be more than [ADDRESS_1153700]'s scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should take the morning dose at home and the evening dose will be administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected relative to the evening dose. 
8. For visits after the Day  1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused study 
drug to the site.  
10.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
A target of approximately 35 subjects, with up to approximately 45, who meet the eligibility criteria 
will be randomized in a ratio of 4:1 (active study drug:placebo).  An interactive web response 
system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. Detailed instructions for 
randomization will be provided separately.  
10.[ADDRESS_1153701] should take 
his/her dose with food. If more than [ADDRESS_1153702] elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. For example, 
• If the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and the 
subject remembers at 12:00 that he/she forgot to take that dose, he/she should take the dose 
with food as soon as possible. 
• If the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and more than [ADDRESS_1153703] elapsed beyond the scheduled dosing time (i.e., the time is past 14:00), the subject would resume dosing with the evening dose at approximately 20:00. 
10.5 Dose Modification for Toxicity 
The dosage of VX-661 or ivacaftor cannot be altered, but the investigator can stop treatment (Section 9.5).

10.11 Blinding and Unblinding  
This is a double-blind study.  
10.11.1 Blinding  
Blinding of treatment codes and applicable study data will be maintained until the da tabase is 
locked for the final analysis.  
The subjects and all site personnel, including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study 
team, will be blinded with the exception of the following: 
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
in the event of a life- threatening medical emergency  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy 
• Vertex Global Patient Safety (G PS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE 
processing and reporting regulations 
• Unblinded statistician preparing the final (production) randomization list, who is not part of 
the study team  
• Vertex Clinical Operations IWRS management  
• Vertex Clinica l Supply Chain 
• Vendor analyzing PK samples  
• Vertex medical monitor may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual 
subjects at any time  
Vertex Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics laboratory personnel will not be involved in the 
conduct of the study and will be unblinded to the bioanalysis results but will remain blinded to subject number and treatment assignment. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_139336], knowledge of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_831217] a subject has been administered active study drug or placebo. Therefore, during the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will have no access to the postdose spi[INVESTIGATOR_831218]. The vendor for central reading of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_139338] (blinded treatment group, with real values for screening and baseline, but with dummy values for all the spi[INVESTIGATOR_831219]) to Vertex to be used for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_139340]. Furthermore, subjects and their caregiver should not be informed of their study- related spi[INVESTIGATOR_831220].  

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.[ADDRESS_1153706] access to the sweat chloride data;  
dummy data will be used to develop statistical programs . During the process of locking the 
clinical database, after all study visits have been completed, access to treatment -blinded sweat 
chloride data will be provided to a small group of individuals who are not part of the Vertex study team. This group, which will consist of a biostatistician, a statistical programmer, a validation statistical programmer, and a clinical reviewer, will review the sweat chloride data to ensure there are no significant data issues and will use the blinded data set to refine the statistical programs. 
MCC Blinding 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_831221], knowledge of the MCC data has the potential to sugg est whether a 
subject has been administered active study drug or placebo. Therefore, during the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will have no access to the MCC data. Results data will be submitted to a central reader. These individuals, including site staff performing the MCC assessment,  will 
otherwise not be involved in any other aspects of study conduct or subject interaction. 
WMC Blinding 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_831221], knowledge of the WMC data has the potential to suggest whether a subject has b een administered active study drug or placebo. Therefore, during the conduct of the 
study, the Vertex study team will have no access to the WMC data, except confirmation that the WMC has passed. Results data will be submitted to the central reader, who will otherwise not be involved in any other aspects of study conduct or subject interaction. 
10.11.[ADDRESS_1153707]'s treatment by [CONTACT_155422]'s study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact [CONTACT_14451]. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact [CONTACT_14451]. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation with the medical monitor. 
In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center (MICC) will answer 
calls [ADDRESS_1153708]'s treatment assignment has been unblinde d for a medical emergency or urgent clinical 
situation, the medical monitor will be notified within [ADDRESS_1153709] operating procedures 
(SOPs). 
For each visit with a PK blood draw, a record of study drug administration will be collected as described in Section 10.2. The collection date and time that each PK blood sample is drawn will 
also be recorded.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Additional tests at screening: The following additional tests will be performed during screening 
to assess eligibility:  
Clinical laboratory assessments from screening will have no clinically significant findings that 
preclude participation in the study, as judged by [CONTACT_093], for a subject to receive study drug on Day 1. 
Pregnancy (β -human chorionic gonadotropin) Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential: 
Serum samples will be obtained as specified in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 and analyzed at the 
central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the site as specified in Table 3-1 
and Table 3-2. 
FSH (Screening Period only) : Blood sample for FSH will be measured for any suspected 
postmenopausal female with at least [ADDRESS_1153719] be ≥40 mIU/mL to be considered postmenopausal. 
CF Genotype (Screening Period only): CF TR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_315421]'s medical record (if available). Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details.  
Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. At the discretion of the local investigator, local laboratories may be used for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it should be verified by [CONTACT_94295]. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base 
the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 
11.7.3 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs 
A physical examination (PE) of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at 
visits noted in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2. At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom-
directed vital sign assessments can be performed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider
. 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes/ears/nose/throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After s creening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as 
AEs. 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. These will be assessed following a [ADDRESS_1153720] in the supin e position. 
11.7.4 Electrocardiograms  
[IP_ADDRESS] Standard [ADDRESS_1153721] 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3-1 and Table 3-2). A window of approximately ± [ADDRESS_1153722] 12- lead 

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 44 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all ECGs 
will adhere to the following guidelines: 
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5  minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
• The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as 
blood draws. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening and Safety Follow -up 
Visits. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_139386]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety Follow-up Visit will be recorded as AEs. 
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >45  msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF valu es from 2  successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. 
If the QTc value remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from the average of the 3  predose 
values on Day 1 or >500 msec) on repeated measurement or is noted  on >[ADDRESS_1153723] their QTc monitored closely until it normalizes or returns to baseline.  
11.7.5 Contraception and Pregnancy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraception  
The effects of VX -[ADDRESS_1153724] battery of in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) studies. VX-661 and IVA were each found to be nonteratogenic in reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits.
21,22 Subjects should follow 
the contraception requirements outlined in this study protocol. The effects of VX-661 monotherapy or in combination with IVA on the PK of hormonal contraceptives are not known. Thus, hormonal contraception is not an acceptable method of contraception for female subjects though it is acceptable for the female partners of male subjects.  
At this stage in the development of VX-661/IVA combination therapy, participation in this study requires a commitment from the research subject and his /her partner to use at least  [ADDRESS_1153725] dose of study drug. 
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 45 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
• The male subject is infertile (e.g.,  bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented 
through examination of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_139387]. 
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential, per the following: 
• Postmenopausal: spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months and serum FSH level ≥40 mIU/mL at screening  
• Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy 
• NOTE: All other female subjects  who have had their first menstrual period will be 
considered to be of childbearing potential. 
Acceptable contraceptive methods:  
Acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects or male partners of female subjects 
include the following: 
• Vasectomy 6  months or more previously, with a documented negative postvasectomy 
semen analysis for sperm.  
• Condom and spermicide. 
• In countries where spermicide is not available, condom without spermicide will be 
considered acceptable.  
• Local regulations may require use of an additional acceptable method of contraception.  
Acceptable contraceptive methods for female subjects  include the following: 
• Bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6  months previously. 
• Continuous use of an intrauterine device (non-hormone- releasing) for at least [ADDRESS_1153726] dose of study drug. 
• Barrier contraception (such as diaphragm, cervical cap, or female condom) and spermicide.  
• In countries where spermicide is not available, barrier contraception without spermicide will be considered acceptable.  
• Local regulations may require use of an additional acceptable method of contraception. 
• NOTE: Hormonal contraceptives will not be considered as an effective method; however, 
female subjects are not required to discontinue hormonal contraceptives. 

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 46 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Acceptable contraceptive methods  for female partners of male subjects:  
• Bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6  months previously. 
• Continuous use of an intrauterine device for at least [ADDRESS_1153727] dose of 
study drug.  
• Barrier contraception (such as diaphragm, cervical cap, or female condom) and

considered acceptable.  
• Local regulations may require use of an additional acceptable method of contraception. 
• Hormonal contraceptives, if successfully used for at least [ADDRESS_1153728] dose of study 
drug.  
Additional notes:  
• Acceptable methods of contraception listed above are examples. Local requirements may 
prohibit the use of some of these examples. Please contact [CONTACT_831246]. 
• A female condom cannot be used with male condom (as a double method of contraception) due to risk of tearing. 
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to follow the contraceptive requirement s of this study if they become sexually active with a 
partner of the opposite sex. 
• If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to 
local regulations and/or requirements. 
• Male subjects must not donate sperm after th e first dose of study drug, throughout the study, 
and for [ADDRESS_1153729] dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant 
during the study through [ADDRESS_1153730] dose of study drug. 
• Male subjects whose female partner becomes pregnant through well-documented in vitro fertilization (donated sperm) or banked sperm (collected before the subject received study 
drug) must be compliant with the contraception requirements. In this sc enario, the male 
subject and his female partner must commit to using barrier methods of contraception (to 
ensure there is no exposure of the fetus to study drug) for the duration of the study and until [ADDRESS_1153731] dose of study drug. 
• Female subj ects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through [ADDRESS_1153732] dose of study drug.

levels must be obtained within 7 ± [ADDRESS_1153739] the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (before confirmatory testing), and 
the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria is met: 
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN a nd/or clinical 
jaundice 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol 
ingestion) for the confirmed elevated transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or 
AST levels have improved, study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued if repeat testing within [ADDRESS_1153740] their transaminases monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. 
Resumption of Study Drug 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation has been identifi ed, study drug may 
be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Approval of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases should be assessed weekly while the subject remains on study drug and during the followup. If a protocol- defined transaminase elevation occurs within [ADDRESS_1153741] be permanently discontinued, 
regardless of the presumed etiology. 
12 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS  
This study is planned as an exploratory study. No type I error control for hypothesis testing will 
be applied, and each of the key endpoints will be assessed individually using a significance level α of 0.05. 
Analysis of a ll data will be performed by [CONTACT_139411](s). Before the database is locked 
for analysis, a detailed plan for the analysis of efficacy and safety data will be presented in a 
statistical analysis plan (SAP), and a detailed plan for PK analysis will be presented in a clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP).  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
A target of approximately 35  subjects, with up to approximately 45, who meet the eligibility 
criteria will be randomized in a ratio of 4:1 to active study drug or placebo  to maximize power 
across the endpoints. 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical mechanisms of VX -661/IVA combination 
therapy in both lung function and extrapulmonary systems in subjects with CF who are 
homozygous for the F508del  mutation on the CFTR gene. For a subset of the key endpoints 
(specifically, MCC and gastrointestinal pH, as captured in Table 12-2 and Table 12-3), no data 
are available for the F508del homozygous population. Therefore, data for both gastrointestinal 
pH and MCC were compi[INVESTIGATOR_220752] a study evaluating I VA monotherapy in patients with the 
G551D-CFTR mutation  for the purpose of sample size calculation.
24 Mean changes from 
baseline for gastrointestinal pH and MCC endpoints in the combination group were derived assuming approximately 50% of those observed for the active group in the observational study. Standard deviations were assumed to be similar to those observed in the reference studies. For ppFEV
1 and sweat chloride endpoints, sample size assumptions were based on observed data 
from the VX11-661- 101 study.23 
Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 36 subjects in the combination group (based on 45 subjects randomized 4:1) will provide adequate power to detect a statistically significant difference from baseline at Day  28 or 29 for the key endpoints, even after assuming that 10 to 
30% subjects may not have complete data through Day 29 (depending on the endpoint). 
Table 12-[ADDRESS_1153742] an expected mean change from 
baseline (∆) for key endpoint measures in the VX-661/IVA combination therapy based on a 
sample size of 36  subjects in the VX-661/IVA group using a 2- sided paired t-test at a 
significance level of α = 0.05. More specifically, the endpoint measures include ppFEV
1 at 
Day 28 (Table 12-1), percent whole lung mucus clearance through 60 minutes at Day  28 (Table 
12-2), small bowel area under the curve (AUC) over 1 -minute mean pH increments through 30 
minutes after gastric emptying at Day  29 (Table 12-3), and sweat chloride at Day  29 (Table 
12-4). Further, a sample size of 28 subjects in the VX661/IVA group (resulting in a total of 35 subjects including 7 subjects in the placebo group) will provide at least 80% power to detect the expected mean change from baseline with the expected standard devi ation. Sample size 
calculations were performed using PASS 11 software, Version 11.0.2. Given the exploratory 

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 50 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   nature of this study, no multiplicity adjustment of type I error will be conducted for the analysis 
of key endpoints.

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.[ADDRESS_1153743] data listings and the 
disposition summary table, unless otherwise specified. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  will include all randomized subjects who were F508del  
homozygous and received at least [ADDRESS_1153744] 1  dose of study drug. The Safety 
Set will be used for all safety analyses.  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of efficacy and safety. Analysis details will be provided in the SAP. 
12.3.1 General Considerations  
Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the 
number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, minimum and maximum 
values will be reported with the same precision as the units of the raw data. The mean and median will be reported to [ADDRESS_1153745] units (metric or International System [SI]) will be converted with the appropriate precision. 
Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be 
presented to [ADDRESS_1153746] recent non- missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug. For ECG, the baseline will be  defined as the average of the most recent triplicate pretreatment 
measurements before the first dose of study drug. 
Change (absolute change) from baseline will be calculated as postbaseline value – baseline 
value. 
Relative change from baseline will be calculated as (postbaseline value – baseline 
value)/baseline value.  
The treatment -emergent (TE) period will include the time from the first dose to the Safety 
Follow-up Visit or [ADDRESS_1153747] dose of the study drug for subjects who did not complete the Safety Follow -up Visit. 
Rules for handling missing data will be described in the SAP.

[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomized, dosed, 
included in the FAS, included in the Safety Set, completed Treatment Period, completed study/Safety Follow -up Visit, and discontinued treatment or study with a breakdown of the 
reasons for discontinuation for treatment or study, respectively) will be summarized overall a nd 
by [CONTACT_1570]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic, background (e.g., medical history), and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized using descriptive summary statistics. Protocol deviations/violations will be provided in an individual subject data listings.  
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_460419] (but are not limited to): sex, race, age, baseline weight, baseline height, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline ppFEV
1, baseline whole lung 
mucus clearance through 60 minutes, and baseline small bowel AUC over 1-minute mean pH increments through 30 minutes after gastric emptying.  
No statistical tests will be carried out to evaluate any baseline imbalance between treatment 
groups. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications used in this study will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced and categorized as the following: 
• Prior medication: any medication that started before initial dosing of study drug, regardless 
of when it ended 
• Concomitant medication: medication continued or newly received during the TE period 
• Post-treatment medication: medication continued or newly received after the TE period  
A given medi cation may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post- treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially  missing 
start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose of 
study drug, concomitantly during the TE period, or after the TE period, it will be considered in all [ADDRESS_1153748] data listing.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Exposure to study drug will be summarized for the FAS in terms of duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day minus the first day  of study drug plus 1. 
Dosing compliance will be summarized for the FAS, and will be derived as 100 ×  [(total number 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_91383]) – ( total number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_114452])]/( total number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_831230] ×  duration of study drug exposure in days).

13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity Grading, 
and Reporting  
13.1.1 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 57 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs, will be assessed and 
those deemed a clinically significant worsening from baseline documented as an AE. When 
possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the  AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnosti c testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_1153749] indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Adverse Events  
 All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the following time points: 
• For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, withdrawal of 
consent) 
• For enrolled subjects: through the Safety Follow- up Visit 
All subjects will be queried, using non-leading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or sym ptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the electronic CRF (eCRF) and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject's source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: 
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “non-serious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity 
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 58 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
• Indication of dose limiting toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and non-serious AEs. The 
guidance available at  the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer. gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed February 
2015). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life- threatening.” In considering 
the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that referen ce ranges 
for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13 -1. 
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities 
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug experience that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, 
at immediate risk of death  
AE: adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to th e 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. 
Table 13-[ADDRESS_1153750] been ruled out, 
and/or the event re -appeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational s tudy drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
AE: adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Action Taken 

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.[ADDRESS_1153751] to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to contin ue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. 
Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/ Resolved 
With Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing 
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 
AE: adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of a Seri ous Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to adm inistration of 
the study drug) 
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 60 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability  is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home) 
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g. surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94250], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139356], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139357]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94253] (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) should not be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe,” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_306031]. In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow- up Visit and are considered related 
to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours. 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_831249](s) and possible etiologies. On the Clinical Trials SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity ass essment will not be required. For the purposes of study 
analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the Vertex Clinical Trials SAE Form.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless o f the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The Vertex Clinical 
Trial SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up 

Protocol VX14- 661-111, Version  4.0 Page 62 of 69 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   will be made before the implementation of any changes. Any departures from protocol will be 
fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol deviation log.  
13.2.4 Access to Records  
The investigator will make the office and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168790]. The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and copy ing, as 
required by [CONTACT_774], by [CONTACT_775] (FDA and others). The investigator will comply with applicable privacy and security laws for use and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this protocol.  
13.2.[ADDRESS_1153752] numbers. As required by [CONTACT_17926], the investigator will allow Vertex and/or its representatives access to all pertinent medical records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the eCRFs/SAE Forms and the review of the data collection process. The FDA (or other regulatory authority) may also request a ccess to all study 
records, including source documentation, for inspection. 
As applicable, in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) and associated privacy regulations, a subject authorization to use personally identifiable health information may be required from each subject before research activities begin. This authorization document will clearly specify which parties will have access to a subject's personal health information, for what purpose, and for how long. 
13.2.[ADDRESS_1153753] Retention  
The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH  GCP guidelines and/or 
applicable local regulatory requirement(s), whichever is longest, as described in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_94255], custody will be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility and Vertex will be notified.  
13.2.7 Study Termination 
At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or may terminate this stud y at any 
particular site. In addition, for reasonable cause, either the investigators or their IRBs may terminate the study at their center.  
Conditions that may lead to reasonable cause and warrant termination include, but are not limited 
to: 
• Subject or investigator noncompliance 
• Unsatisfactory subject enrollment 
• Lack of adherence to protocol procedures 
• Lack of evaluable and/or complete data

13.[ADDRESS_1153754] will be entered into an eCRF by [CONTACT_94326] a secure, validated web -based electronic data captur e (EDC) application. Vertex 
will have read -only access to site- entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the eCRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database.  
13.4 Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by [CONTACT_139417]. On- site checking of the eCRFs/SAE Forms for completeness and 
clarity, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be 
performed.  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_139411]. Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_782] a repre sentative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the 
eCRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements. 
13.[ADDRESS_1153755]. It is the investigator's responsibility 
to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject's 
eCRF. Source documentation supporting the eCRF data will indicate the subject's participation in the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. 
The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the eCRF as soon as possible after 
information is c ollected. 
The audit trail entry will show the user's identification information and the date and time of any correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the eCRFs, including any changes made to the eCRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the investigator is responsible. 
Vertex will retain the eCRF data  and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival 
eCRF in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the inves tigator's study  file.

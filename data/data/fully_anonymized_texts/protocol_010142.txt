1.  INTRODUCTION  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with increased 
mortality, morbidity and impaired quality of life. Catheter ablation has become the standard of 
care for symptomatic patients with drug -refractory AF and the co rnerstone of ablation remains  
the electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein isolation = PVI).1 For patients 
with paroxysmal AF, l ong-term effectiveness of an approach based on PVI as the sole ablation 
strategy is reported to be 81.6% at 12 months, 73.8% at 24 months, and 68.1% at [ADDRESS_645813] -ablation  ranging from 51 up to 60% 
regardless of the catheter ablation strategy,  addition of antiarrhythmic drugs, use of cryoballoon 
v. RF ablation, or lesion set  performed .3-6  This ceiling of efficacy in the persistent AF 
population may be attributable to the complex functional mechanisms of AF contributing to an 
individual patient’s disease state.   
Beyond the pulmonary vein triggers, t he development and persistence of AF depends upon a 
localized source —a trigger or driver as well as susceptible substrate, such as re -entrant circuits 
and or regions of fibrotic atrial myocardium with abnormal conduction properties.1,7,8 After 
pulmonary vein isolation has been performed, a ccurate, enhanced mappi[INVESTIGATOR_501384] -PV drivers/triggers is needed to further guide the next step in the ablation strategy.   
Efforts to hone in on AF mechanisms underlying persistent AF have multiplied and several 
different methods for identifying these localized sources have been put forth using global or 
panoramic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_220201].9-12  However, due to the chaotic nature of the intracardiac 
electrograms (EGMs) characteristic of AF, identifying active focal sources relevant to the initiation 
and maintenance of AF has remained challenging.  
Electrographic Flow (EGF) Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (Ablamap® Software, Ablacon, Wheat Ridge, CO) is an 
innovative technique to create full temporospatial visualizations of  organized cardiac action 
potential flow within the chaotic conduction of AF that can  discriminate between active sources 
of excitation and passive rotations, which do not generate action potentials; and can estimate the 
average activity of such a source during a time interval such as one minute.11 It has been shown 
that only those sources that are generating excitation and that are active more than a quarter of the 
time are significant predictors for AF recurrence after PVI.12 Using  a 64-electrode basket mappi[INVESTIGATOR_169216] , the software collects unipolar intracardiac EGM s.  These EGMS are then processed using 
a proprietary algorithm employing Green’s energy -optimizing formula to create a smooth 
landscape of voltage potentials for each sample point in time.  An optical flow mappi[INVESTIGATOR_501385] a continuous recording of the excitation waves’ 
behavior  and propagation over time.  The software also displays the dominant patterns of the 
excitation wave propagation recordings as vector flow maps, whose consistency over time can be 
measured and statistically analyzed  (Figure 1):

evaluate the Ablamap Software  (FLOW -AF Study, NCT:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . A total of  [ADDRESS_645814] Device Description  
The Ablamap Software is an electrophysiological mappi[INVESTIGATOR_501387]. The software uses an optical flow algorithm to 
process recorded files of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from multiple -electrode mappi[INVESTIGATOR_501388] (e.g. , basket catheters) by [CONTACT_501405] (EGF) for each point in space.  
 
The output is a set of files that graphically depi[INVESTIGATOR_501389] (velocity vectors) and sources 
where the flow is generated. The software discriminates between sources that may be focal or 
rotational and passive rotations that are not sources; detects spatial and temporal stability of 
sources; and defines the activity of sources as the percentage of time a source is at its maximum 
stability.  
 
The Ablamap  Software is stand -alone software installed on a standard, commercially available 
desktop or laptop computer. The software processes ECG data files that have been saved on a USB 
memory device, the computer, or a data server. The software does not control o r interface with any 
medical device. There is no user or patient contact.

AF-FLOW  Registry  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_645815] clinical data 
to further  characterize the performance of the Ablamap S oftware for its intended use . We also 
intend to continue to clinically validate the ability of the Ablamap Software  to identify AF sources 
and guide ablation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.    
2.3  Indications for Use  
The Ablamap  Software is used to analyze intra -cardiac electrogram (EGM) signals and display 
results in a visual format for evaluation by a physician in order to assist in the diagnosis of complex 
cardiac arrhythmias.  
2.4  Intended Use 
The Ablamap  Software is intended to be used during electrophysiology procedures on patients for 
whom an electrophysiology procedure has been prescribed and only by [CONTACT_501406].  
The Ablamap  Software is CE -marked and FDA 510(k) cleared for use in the EU and [LOCATION_002].    
2.5  Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.5.1 Anticipated Risks associated with the Ablamap  Software  
There are no patient or user safety issues or hazards identified for the Ablamap  Software in the 
clinical data analyzed within a comprehensive literature review  and the FLOW -AF Clinical 
Study . Internal data generated as part of the risk analysis of the Ablamap  Software indicates 
there were no patient or user safety issues or hazards identified.  
The Ablamap  Software Safety Classification per BS EN [ZIP_CODE]:2006+A1:[ADDRESS_645816] -market registry is to obtain clinical data in order to further 
characterize the performance of the Ablamap System for its intended use . Specifically, we will 
evaluate the ability of the Ablamap Electrographic Flow (EGF) System to identify AF sources and 
guide ablation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.    
3.2 Study  Endpoints  
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint : Acute procedure success defined as the ability to successfully 
ablate AF sources identified by [CONTACT_501407].  
• Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoint : Freedom from documented epi[INVESTIGATOR_501390] ([ADDRESS_645817] ablation) through [ADDRESS_645818] -market registry that will obtain 
clinical data in order to characterize the performance of the Ablamap  Software  for its intended use 
in a real -world setting.  Specifically, we will evaluate the ability of the Ablamap  Software  to 
identify AF sources and guide ablation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.  This registry  
will enroll up to 100 subjects.  Subjects  that present with atrial fibrillation  and meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible for enrollment.     
3.4 Enrollment/Screen Failures  
A subject is considered enrolled after signing the informed consent.   All enrolled subjects will then 
proceed to complete the screening and baseline tests.  
3.[ADDRESS_645819] Follow -up 
All subjects will be followed per protocol in relation to the date of the index ablation procedure.  
Follow up will be required  at 12  months  (±45  days)  post index ablation procedure. If a subject 
presents at any time during the [ADDRESS_645820] will 
be eligible for  an EGF -guided ablation procedure. The follow -up schedule will remain the same 
and will  not be reset if the patient requires a recurrence procedure.     
   
Note:  If any recurrences occur between any study procedures, cardioversion is allowed as 
often as needed.  The number of cardioversions for each subject will be counted and reported.    
 
3.6 Statistical Analysis  
The primary  efficacy  endpoint of th is registry is the successful elimination of significant sources 
of excitation. Target parameter is the activity of the leading source. According to the retrospective 
data analyzed previously, the critical threshold for significance of a source is an activity of 2 6%.  
AF-FLOW  Registry Protocol  
Protocol No. CP -003-Rev A  
 
AF-FLOW  Registry  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_645821] of targeted ablation will be statistically analy zed by [CONTACT_501408]. If an ablation is not 
successfully reducing the activity or if the location of the leading source changes upon ablation, 
ablation will be repeated.  
The secondary endpoint of the study is freedom from documented epi[INVESTIGATOR_501390] ([ADDRESS_645822] ablation) through [ADDRESS_645823] SELECTION

or up to 48 hours prior to the start of any study procedure ; however,  if any 
evidence of left atrial thrombus is discovered, the ablation procedure will not be 
performed at that time. The subject may either be excluded from the study or 
maintained on oral anticoagulation  for an additional period of time (at 
investigator’s discretion).  Repeat imaging  to rule out thrombi will be required 
prior to study procedure.  
o A new echocardiogram (transthoracic or transesophageal) should be performed 
prior to ablation procedure if one has not been performed within six months of the 
enrollment procedure or if previous data is not available.

procedure and not restarted after the ablation procedure .  
5.4 General Procedural Recommendations  
The ablation procedures (including patient preparation, fluid, ACT, and access site management) 
should be performed per the institution’s standard EP lab protocol. All procedure logistical data, 
ablation parameters, procedural outcomes, and adverse events,  will be recorded throughout the 
procedure. Prophylactic administration of intravenous diuretics during or after the procedure is 
allowed and will not be considered an adverse event.

5.6 Blanking Period  
The blanking period is the 90 -day period following the index ablation  procedure.   During the 
blanking period, repeat ablation should not be performed ; however, cardioversion may be done 
at the discretion of the investigator.  If the subject has a recurrence of AF during the 
blanking period and is placed on AADs, they should be discontinued from the AADs [ADDRESS_645828] be evaluated at twelve months (365 +/ - 45 days) after the index ablation 
procedure.  
During this follow -up, the following will be performed:  
• Any previously unreported AF recurrences since the index ablation procedure (or 
cardioversion or repeat ablation procedure for previous AF recurrence ). 
• Any medication changes (AADs, anticoagula nts, and other cardiac medications)  
• Perform a 12 -lead ECG  
• Complete the Study Completion CRF

5.11 Early Termination of Clinical Investigation  
Both the Sponsor and Investigator reserve the right to terminate the clinical investigation at any 
time.  
The Sponsor may suspend or prematurely terminate either a clinical investigation or the entire 
clinical investigation for significant and documented reasons. Such reasons are as follows:  
• If suspi[INVESTIGATOR_168343], 
or when so instructed by [CONTACT_1383] /IRB  or regulatory authorities, the sponsor may suspend 
the clinical investigation while the risk is assessed. The sponsor may terminate the 
clinical investigation if an unacceptable risk is confirmed.  
• Monitoring or auditing identifies serious or repeated deviations on the part of an 
investigator.  
After review of the clinical safety data, the Sponsor and Investigator may agree to terminate the 
clinical investigation if necessary. If necessary, and after review and consultation with Principal 
Investigator, Sponsor will make a final determination on w hether to terminate the study.  
A principal investigator, EC /IRB , or regulatory authority may suspend or prematurely terminate 
participation in the clinical study at the investigation sites for which they are responsible.  
If suspension or premature termination occurs, the terminating party shall justify its decision in 
writing and promptly inform the other parties with whom they are in direct communication.  The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_501397] /IRB  or the regulatory authority.  
If, for any reason, the sponsor suspends or prematurely terminates the investigation at an individual 
investigation site, the sponsor shall inform the responsible regulatory authority as appropriate and 
ensure that the EC  or IRB  is notified, either by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_10368]. If the 
suspension or premature termination was in the interest of safety, the sponsor shall inform all other 
principal investigators.

Protocol No. CP -003-Rev A  
 
AF-FLOW  Registry  Confidential  Page 17 of 24 
 
If suspension or premature termination occurs:  
• The sponsor remains responsible for providing resources to fulfill the obligations from 
the protocol and existing agreements for following up the subjects enrolled in the 
clinical investigation, and  
• The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee will promptly inform the 
enrolled subjects at his/her investigation site, if appropriate.  
5.12 Adverse Event Reporting  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject. All adverse events are 
to be reported on the Adverse Event Case Report Form. All adverse events will be documented 
with the date of occurrence, relatedness to device or procedure, sever ity, action taken, resolution 
and any pertinent additional information.  
Adverse events will be reported and classified by [CONTACT_501411], 
using clinical signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values as needed.  The investigator will 
classify the adverse events based on the definitions as follows (I SO [ZIP_CODE]:2011).  
Term  Definition  
Adverse event (AE):   Any untoward medical occurrence, 
unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory 
findings) in subjects, users or other persons, 
whether or not related to the test device.  
Adverse device effect (ADE):  Adverse event related to the use of a test 
device.  
Serious adverse event (SAE):  Is an adverse event that:  
a) led to a death,  
b) led to serious deterioration in the health of 
the subject, that either resulted in,  
1) a life-threatening illness or injury or,  
2) a permanent impairment of a body 
structure or a body function or,  
3) an in -patient or prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109],  
4) a medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent life -threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a 
body structure or a body function.

5.14 Relationship to the Device:  
Principal Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the test 
device caused or contributed to an AE. Sponsor defines three degrees of relatedness: not related, 
possible and related to the Test Device. The following definitions will be used to assess the 
relationship of the Adverse Effect.  
Not related  no temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified; or the 
device cannot be implicated  
Possibly 
related  temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; however, 
involvement of the device cannot be excluded  
Related  temporal association; other etiologies are possible, but unlikely

used during the study procedure (basket catheter, diagnostic catheters, sheaths, etc.) malfunctions 
at any time, the study site should follow the procedures for returning the produ ct for investigation 
to the man ufacturer of the device.  In the unlikely event that the Ablamap  software fails, a detailed 
description of the failure mechanism should be summarized on the Device Deficiency Case Report 
Form.

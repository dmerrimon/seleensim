CONFIDENTIAL1 Introduction
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on 
Harmonization ICHE6), the Code of Federal Regulations Title [ADDRESS_693920] (i.e., 
Dartmouth’s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, CPHS) research policies and 
procedures. 
1.1 Background
As medical surveillance and effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_534231], the number 
of people living with a history of cancer will increase drastically. “Quality of survival” is 
increasingly being recognized as an important mission of cancer care. Chemotherapy induced 
peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a common, potentially severe and dose-limiting adverse effect 
of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. A major shortfall in management of subjects with CIPN is 
the absence of (i) early predictors for those at greatest risk of CIPN, and (ii) sensitive 
biomarkers to identify disease onset at an earlier stage. 
The pathophysiology of CIPN is not completely elucidated; however, an important set of data 
implicates oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and microvascular injury (Carozzi et al., 
2006). Alterations in antioxidant activity (glutathione reductase, catalase and superoxide 
dismutase) after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents increase the susceptibility of neurons to 
injury from reactive oxygen species (ROS). Some chemotherapeutic regimens have been 
associated with ROS accumulation in dorsal root ganglion neurons. TRPA1, a neuronal 
transient receptor potential channel A1 gene implicated in neuronal nociception, is activated by 
[CONTACT_534255] (NO). Mitochondrial damage resulting from oxidative stress has been suggested 
as a mechanism for chemotherapy associated neurotoxicity. A specific single nucleotide 
polymorphism in a glutathione-S-transferase gene (GSTP1) has been extensively investigated 
in relation to peripheral neurotoxicity. These studies have revealed an association in 
approximately half of the studies completed. This association represents one of the strongest 
among candidate genes evaluated in polymorphism association studies. In an experimental 
model of neuropathy induced by [CONTACT_534256], preferential and early loss of small 
unmyelinated  and C) fibers was observed. This early effect on small, unmyelinated fibers 
was seen even in the setting of preserved Schwann cell proliferation and survival. This 
surprising finding indicates that Schwann cell mitochondrial function is vital for normal function 
and survival of, not only large myelinated fibers, but small unmyelinated fibers; further, those 
fibers most affected in CIPN  and C) are selectively vulnerable (Viader et al., 2011). Axons 
of C-fibers in rats exposed to paclitaxel demonstrate swollen and vacuolated mitochondria. 
These mitochondrial changes mirror pain behavior in the animals and further support 
pathophysiology related to mitotoxicity (Flatters and Bennett, 2006). Clinical trials with 
antioxidant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_534232]. A recent, well-
designed clinical trial testing –lipoic acid revealed no significant decrease in incidence and 
severity of peripheral neurotoxicity. However, smaller trials using other antioxidants, including 
tocopherol, reduced glutathione and oral glutamine, have been shown to reduce the incidence 
and severity of neuropathy. In addition to direct neuronal effects, oxidative stress has been 
implicated in endothelial cell apoptosis of the vasa nervorum. This is thought to result in 
peripheral nerve ischemia and is supported by [CONTACT_534257]. These data support the use of metrics of oxidative stress and 
microvascular injury as biomarkers of CIPN. Another important pathophysiologic mechanism of 
Biomarkers in CIPN page [ADDRESS_693921] of inflammatory cytokines on nociceptive sensors or nerve fibers has been proposed 
as the etiology for the immediate painful paresthesias experienced after administration of 
chemotherapeutic agents (Wang et al., 2012). Oxidative stress promotes the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines; there is evidence that hypoxia can induce a pro-inflammatory 
phenotype in endothelial and tumor cells (Tellier et al., 2015). Therefore the ability to measure 
changes in tissue oxygen could provide a very effective tool to provide quantitative 
measurements of the key component of oxidative stress. We propose the use of a technique 
uniquely available at Dartmouth-Hitchcock (clinical oximetry based on electron paramagnetic 
resonance [EPR] spectroscopy) as a novel biomarker to predict the occurrence, severity and 
duration of CIPN in individual participants. EPR oximetry is a clinically applicable tool that has 
the unique capability of repeatedly measuring tissue oxygen. It is non-invasive and rapid, 
requiring less than [ADDRESS_693922]. This allows for 
the longitudinal surveillance of tissue oxygen that can be correlated with clinical and 
electrophysiological markers of neuropathy as neurotoxicity develops, progresses and resolves. 
Correlation of this metric with established indices of neuropathy will not only provide critical 
insights into the underlying pathophysiology of CIPN, but may also provide the opportunity of a 
more sensitive biomarker for clinical trials.
Neurofilament light chain (NF-L) is emerging as a sensitive blood-based biomarker of axonal 
degeneration.  NF-L is a component of the axonal cytoskeleton that leaks out of degenerating 
axons.  NF-L has been reported to be elevated in plasma or serum in a wide range of 
neurodegenerative disorders, including CNS disorders such as multiple sclerosis (Siller et al., 
2018) and ALS (Lu et al., 2015) as well as PNS disorders such as Charcot Marie Tooth 
(Sandelius et al., 2018) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (Mariotto et al., 2018).  To date, there are 
no published reports of elevated blood NF-L levels in patients with CIPN, although it has been 
reported to increase in rat model of vincristine-induced neuropathy (Meregalli et al., 2018).  We 
propose measuring blood NF-L levels at baseline and at each chemotherapy treatment session 
in order to determine if blood NF-L increases and how longitudinal changes in NF-L correlate 
with clinical and electrophysiological measures of neuropathy.
There are data linking single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP’s) to neurotoxicity (Baldwin et al., 
2012). Polymorphisms in genes to include CYP 2C8, CYP 3A5, ABCB1 and FANCD2 have all 
been associated with CIPN, including differences in interindividual toxicity and response 
(Abraham et al., 2014; Boora et al., 2016). Data remain inconclusive however. In this proposal, 
we will provide study subjects with the option to donate blood for placement in a CIPN-
biorepository. Although not in the realm of the current pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], this will allow for future studies 
of relevant polymorphisms in a cohort of very well phenotyped individuals. 
1.2 Investigational Agents
1.2.1 – Electrophysiological Assessment
1.2.1a – Nerve Conduction Studies:  Electrophysiological assessments, used as part of 
the assessment for neuropathy, will be conducted under the supervision of the PI (VL) using a 
certified Teca Synergy T5EP NCS EMP EP machine. The nerve conduction studies (NCS) will 
be measured using standardized techniques for surface recording and stimulation developed in 
our Clinical Neurophysiology laboratory at Dartmouth-Hitchcock for clinical care. The widely 
Biomarkers in CIPN page 9
Version 2.3
CONFIDENTIALaccepted criteria for identification of abnormalities will be used. Sensory conductions may 
include sural, medial plantar and dorsal sural antidromic testing with assessment of peak to 
peak amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials and sensory conductions. Motor conductions 
may also be tested in tibial and peroneal nerves with measurement of baseline to peak 
amplitude of the compound muscle action potential, motor conduction velocities and distal motor 
latencies. Recording will be performed from the extensor digitorum brevis and tibialis anterior 
muscles.  Additional or different nerves may be tested at the discretion of the examiner.  
Temperature will be controlled and data compared with normative age-matched reference data. 
Testing will be performed by [CONTACT_42623] (EMG) technicians trained in performing 
electrodiagnostic studies. Testing will be repeated to ensure verifiable amplitudes. All devices 
and tests are considered part of routine, standard care; no investigational devices or tests will 
be used. 
1.2.1b – Sudoscan : One limitation of NCS is that most toxic neuropathies involve 
primarily small, unmyelinated (C-) and small myelinated nerve fibers ( ; these small fibers 
are less sensitively assessed with NCS than large fiber function. Changes in peripheral 
autonomic nervous system function are an early manifestation of distal small fiber neuropathy. 
Sudomotor dysfunction is one of the earliest detectable neurophysiologic abnormalities in distal 
small fiber neuropathies, including toxic neuropathies. SUDOSCAN (Impeto Medical, Paris, 
[LOCATION_009]) is a simple, noninvasive, easy-to-perform sudomotor test that measures sweat gland 
function that also compares favorably to other metrics of small fiber function, including 
quantitative sensory testing (QST), skin biopsy for epi[INVESTIGATOR_534233]. SUDOSCAN has been approved by [CONTACT_4760] a sudomotor 
function test; the device uses a low DC voltage (  4 volts) to activate sweat glands in the soles 
of the feet and the palms of the hand and measures the current of chloride ions that flow out of 
the sweat glands in response to the electric impulse. The test takes between two-three minutes . 
1.2.2 – India ink and EPR1
A non-significant risk (NSR) investigational device and an exempt device will be used in this 
study: (1) EPR spectroscopy designed to assess oxygen in vivo in human tissues and has been 
previously recognized by [CONTACT_291239] a NSR device, and (2) the use of paramagnetic carbon 
particulates that are sensitive to the amount of oxygen that is present, suspended in a type of 
India ink and injected into superficial tissues; India ink is an exempt device. (See Section 5A for 
details about the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) designation of India ink for medical 
useas a device, for the purpose of approving the marketing of sterile forms on India ink for 
medical use only. As detailed in Section 5A, the FDA considers tattooing inks to be cosmetic for 
regulatory purposes and does not require oversight of their manufacture or labeling or 
packaging). 
(1) EPR oximetry: The clinical EPR instrument, located in 2K -- the Radiation Oncology clinical 
suite of DHMC, operates at ~430 G (0.043 T) magnetic field strength and ~1.[ADDRESS_693923] 
energy as the radiofrequency (RF) source. The field is very low compared to whole-body clinical 
MRI scanners that operate typi[INVESTIGATOR_22003] 1.5T or 3T magnetic field strength. The 1.2 GHz RF 
source in our clinical EPR scanner will use <20-mW power continuously. The maximum specific 
absorption rate (SAR) in the tissue at the position that should have the greatest density of RF, 
directly under the loop of the surface-loop resonator, has been estimated to be 3.7±1.2 W/kg at 
1 Note that this protocol will use the same ink and the same procedures for injecting it and for 
measuring oxygen in tissues with EPR oximetry as in Velos D17008/CPHS [ZIP_CODE] ( Measurement 
of the Partial Pressure of Oxygen in Cancers Using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Oximetry 
with Injected India Ink); PI [INVESTIGATOR_534234]). An overview of oximetry using India ink is presented 
here with emphasis on its application to this proposal.

Version 2.3
CONFIDENTIAL100 -mW incident 1.2 GHz RF power using a surface-loop resonator with an efficiency of about 
0.1 mT/W1/2 (Salikhov and Swartz 2005). This estimated value is substantially below the 
recommended limit (12 W/kg) in the relevant regulation for extremities. Thus the SAR for our 
measurements, even at 100-mW power, is well within the acceptable range for human 
applications. The protocol for our clinical EPR scanner will not use rapi[INVESTIGATOR_534235]. However, the EPR measurements use three types of 
magnetic fields that change in time during the measurement:
1. Main magnetic field sweep: The sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_534236], 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a linear sweep of 8 G over a 30-sec period, which translates to a rate of ~3x10-5 T/sec. 
2. Modulation field: We typi[INVESTIGATOR_292717] a modulation field of 1 G or less at 20 kHz, which will amount 
to 2T/sec. 
3. Multisite oximetry: We apply a static gradient magnetic field, which will be applied during the 
entire 3-sec duration of data acquisition.
In all three scenarios, the rate of change of magnetic field is well below the limit of 20 T/sec set 
by [CONTACT_941] 1988 or 1995 Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices (MRDD) Guidance. Hence the 
time-rate of change in magnetic field is not expected to have any significant effect on the subject.  
 L-band EPR spectroscopy for in vivo oximetry in human subjects has been used at Dartmouth 
since about 2002, in two protocols previously approved by [CONTACT_534252] (#[ZIP_CODE] and #[ZIP_CODE]). This 
device is essentially identical to the L-band EPR spectrometer used to detect radiation in vivo in 
teeth, in protocol #[ZIP_CODE]). This device has been previously evaluated by [CONTACT_534258] (IDE), i.e., it has been classified as a nonsignificant 
risk device (NSR); see definition below). 
 Under 21 CFR 812.3(m), a non significant risk (NSR) device means an investigational device 
that does NOT meet any of the following criteria for being a significant risk, i.e., it should NOT fit 
these criteria:
 • _Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject; 
• _Is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and presents a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; 
• _Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to 
the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or 
• _Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 
The EPR oximetry device does not fit any of these criteria and should continue to be considered 
a NSR device.
(2) The India ink we propose to use in this study consists of 20-50µL of Carlo Erba ink injected in 
subcutaneous tissue at the distal fourth interosseous toe web. This ink (referred to herein as Carlo 
Erba ink, CE ink, or India ink) is based on a paramagnetic black pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517]: purified and 
depyrogenated charcoal manufactured by [CONTACT_534259] a sterile ink using the 
protocol developed at the lab of the NIH-Funded Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_189052] 1, [CONTACT_534291], using the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): 63.[ADDRESS_693924] 
Method: Preparation of a Carlo Erba charcoal suspension for EPR Oximetry. A summary of the

Arabic that demonstrates a hazard to the public when it is used at 
levels that are now current and in the manner now practiced.”

classifies inks used for permanent 
cosmetic tattoos and for medical

and labeling of the products. It also 
has approved the voluntary  510(k) 
premarket notification request to 
market Endomark, a sterile India 
ink, and for Spot ink as devices to 
be used for medical injections 
subcutaneously. Hence we 
conclude that our use of India ink 
is a device; Section 5A has details.
 Section 5A and Appendix C present additional details about why India ink is a device and about 
its risks. To summarize: Carlo Erba does not fit any of the criteria for being a significant risk device; 
more importantly, Carlo Erba ink has been recognized by [CONTACT_534260], i.e., India ink fits the criteria in 21 C.F.R. 812.2(c)  as being exempt from the IDE 
requirements.  This section 1.2 (and the required form for devices) present details about why EPR 
oximetry is a nonsignificant risk device. Therefore, we request that CPHS designate India ink as 
being exempt from IDE requirements and designate EPR oximetry as being a NSR device when 
approving this protocol.
1.[ADDRESS_693925], microvascular injury – potential 
biomarkers of CIPN.
The development of India ink as an oxygen probe for pre-clinical and clinical applications has 
been carried out by [CONTACT_534261]. Swartz at the EPR Center at Dartmouth and [CONTACT_534292] 
at Catholic University of Louvain (CUL) in Brussels, Belgium. 
The preparation and paramagnetic properties and suitability for in vivo oximetry of 36 
commercially available charcoals, before and after suspending as an ink, were carried out by 
[CONTACT_534262] 12
Version 2.3
CONFIDENTIALJordan et al. (1998). While they found that several charcoals had sufficient paramagnetic 
properties to be suitable for EPR spectroscopy, only three—including two independent batches 
of Carlo Erba—demonstrated appropriate stability over time, as assessed by [CONTACT_534263]-
induced hypoxia. For these reasons, and because charcoal based inks have been preferred in 
Europe for medical use as injections in humans, Gallez’ laboratory (in Brussels) continued to 
conduct a series of in vitro and in vivo studies of oximetry using Carlo Erba as the basis of the 
India ink sensor. 
For both charcoal-based India inks (e.g., Carlo Erba) and carbon black-based India ink (e.g., 
Printex U), the suspending agents and any additives for the inks (added either to obtain a viscosity 
suitable for injection or to enhance the physical stability of the suspension) needed to be based 
on biocompatible and safe materials that also had properties suitable for stable paramagnetic 
signals and demonstrable responsiveness to the presence of oxygen in tissues, particularly at low 
(hypoxic) levels of greatest clinical interest. An additional consideration was to identify pi[INVESTIGATOR_534237]. Therefore, a series of tests were conducted on commercially available carbon 
particulates to identify the most suitable pi[INVESTIGATOR_534238]/sensor for oximetry. 
The preparation and biocompatibility testing of oxygen sensitive inks for EPR oximetry using 
carbon black (the basis of Printex U India ink) has been described in detail by [CONTACT_534264]. 
(2004). The biocompatibility studies were performed for a range of ink preparations based on 
carbon black, including the Printex U carbon black (originally manufactured by [CONTACT_534265]-Hüls). 
The coatings were a biocompatible polymer carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxypropyl 
methyl cellulose (HPMC), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). Tests included cytotoxicity via 
tetrazolium salt MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Aldrich) 
assay, hemolysis, and histology using hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining of mouse muscle tissue. 
No significant cytotoxicity was observed with the MTT assay for any ink preparations, irrespective 
of biocompatible polymer coating. A slight hemolytic effect was observed for the various ink 
preparations relative to the negative control (Polyethylene USP88), though effects for all 
preparations were small when compared to the positive control (copper plate) and coating with 
CMC served to reduce the effect. Using the Printex U ink preparations, histology showed no sign 
of toxicity or necrosis surrounding the carbon black at the site of injection. This biocompatible ink 
has been successfully applied to volunteers and patients at Dartmouth without any serious 
toxicity.
Additional details about the preclinical data for EPR oximetry using India ink are contained in 
protocol [ZIP_CODE].

al., 2004 and Velasco et al., 2014) support precise clinical and electrophysiological evaluation of 
the PNS to predict the incidence and severity of CIPN. No clinical trials to date have identified 
and measured biomarkers for assessing the extent of CIPN or predicting outcomes. 
Biomarkers in CIPN page [ADDRESS_693927] conducted a series of in vivo EPR oximetry measurements in 
human subjects, using India ink as the paramagnetic material. India ink is highly sensitive to tissue 
oxygen levels, is very stable in tissue, and already has been approved for use in human subjects 
(Swartz et al., 1994). Some existing oximetry measurements in human subjects have been made 
in subcutaneous tissues in the feet of normal volunteers, performed under a CPHS approved 
protocol to study healthy volunteers. The primary clinical goal of these studies has been to 
develop and validate EPR oximetry as a technique to monitor tissue oxygen levels in the feet of 
diabetic patients to guide therapeutic intervention for peripheral vascular disease. These 
experiments confirm that the method can be used effectively and repeatedly in human subjects, 
as detailed further in protocol [ZIP_CODE].
1.5 Risk/Benefits
The most important potential risk is that participation in a study of neurotoxic sequelae to a 
chemotherapeutic regimen may increase anxiety about the therapy; this is especially true given 
the subjects will likely have recently learned of their cancer diagnosis and will have just been 
introduced to all the possible short-term and long-term risk of chemotherapy. Discussion of 
chemotherapy risk is part of a dedicated pre-therapy assessment and education visit (“pre-
chemo visit”) to place the risk of neurotoxicity within its appropriate context. This will also be 
discussed during recruitment and as part of the consent process. A potential benefit is the 
enhancement of opportunities to educate subjects regarding CIPN. Other risks include the 
discomfort of electrophysiologic evaluation, the time needed to complete questionnaires/ 
undergo neurologic examination, and loss of privacy relating to collection of study data. 
Electrophysiologic evaluation of large fiber neuropathy is performed using nerve conduction 
studies (NCS) ; this is a test used routinely in the clinic for diagnosis of nerve disorders. Nerve 
conduction studies involve delivery of a mild electrical stimulation to the skin while recording the 
response from a superficial disc electrode placed over top of the skin. There is a risk of 
discomfort with the test but discomfort is generally mild and will be mitigated with careful study 
procedures. Evaluation of sudomotor function and small-fiber neuropathy is performed using 
SUDOSCAN, which may cause a slight tingling, but painless, sensation in the feet or the hands 
when the electrical impulse is being generated. 
There is a risk of mild discomfort with placement of the paramagnetic material for EPR oximetry. 
The material is placed using a needle and syringe. In addition to the discomfort of the needle, 
there is a risk of minor swelling and discomfort after the injection (can persist for up to 3 days) 
and a chance of the India ink spreading, resulting in a larger dark spot than is expected. It 
should be noted that IRB approval has already been granted for the use of this technique in 
other applications (#[ZIP_CODE] and #[ZIP_CODE]) and is in process of being approved for #[ZIP_CODE] where 
these risks are detailed. 
If a patient receives a PET/CT scan for restaging a tumor in the area of the injection, there may 
be a false positive at the site of the injection. Because this study does not involve ink injections 
into a tumor, this is suspected to be a very minimal risk.
Subjects will be protected against unnecessary risk with the use of careful study procedures. 
Records containing personally identifying information of subjects participating in the study will 
be coded and kept in a locked office in a secure environment. Access to code key will be limited 
to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32528]. The risk of discomfort with the placement of the paramagnetic 
ink is minimal. Patients will be fully informed that the ink will make a permanent mark similar to a 
Biomarkers in CIPN page 14

CONFIDENTIALsmall tattoo. The risk of breathing 100% oxygen through a nonrebreather mask for 10 minutes is 
minimal. The risk of discomfort with electrodiagnostic study will be minimized by [CONTACT_746] a 
focused evaluation with the minimal number of electrical stimuli/needle electrode penetrations 
as possible and as per standard clinical practice.
Patients will be informed of any risk associated with blood draws which includes discomfort 
during the procedure, bruising, bleeding, swelling at the puncture site, infection,
and feeling lightheaded or passing out during the procedure. Since blood will be generally 
drawn in conjunction with the patient’s routine laboratory assessments for their chemotherapy, 
the additional risk should be minimal. 
Patients will be informed of the risks of participating in research involving the study of their 
genetic information. The informed consent form will have an opt-in box ensuring that each 
patient is aware of the risks and research purposes of the blood draw and genetic analysis 
being conducted. 
Patients will be informed that they may not personally benefit from participation in this study; 
however, the study aims to help patients in the future. The identification of a biomarker that not 
only provides information regarding the underlying pathophysiology, but also allows for early 
prediction of those patients at greatest risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_80032]-induced peripheral 
neurotoxicity, is of significant benefit to patients undergoing chemotherapy. Early 
identification/prediction can help oncologists tailor and advise patients about side effects they 
may expect to develop and help them make informed choices about their therapy. 
Advancements in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this neurotoxicity will lead to better 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], both in the prevention and the management of CIPN.

Primary Objectives: 
The primary objective of the study is: to prospectively compare peripheral tissue oxygenation 
response between patients who later develop CIPN, and those who do not.
Secondary Objectives: 
The secondary objectives of the study are to: (i) establish the feasibility of the approach, (ii) to 
evaluate the utility of longitudinal clinical and electrophysiologic assessments and (iii) to 
describe changes in biomarkers of axonal degeneration including neurofilament light chain over 
the course of chemotherapy
Specific Aim #1: Adapt the existing clinically established techniques for EPR oximetry to
measurements of oxygen to be relevant to the pathophysiology of CIPN . In the proposed 
research, we will use an India ink injection and obtain an initial oximetry reading assessing local 
oxygen metabolism. The objective of this aim will be to establish feasibility of the approach and 
obtain preliminary data for a more definitive and statistically robust cohort. Five measurements 
will be done within each study visit window to improve the strength of the readings. 
Biomarkers in CIPN page 15
Version 2.3
CONFIDENTIALSpecific Aim #2: Establish a pre-exposure neurologic phenotype and baseline tissue oximetry in 
cancer patients scheduled to receive neurotoxic chemotherapy . In order to assess a potential 
biomarker for CIPN, it must be correlated to metrics of CIPN that can be reliably followed and 
quantitated as a function of progression and severity. 
Specific Aim #3: Re-evaluate neurologic phenotype and tissue oximetry in symptomatic patients 
after exposure to a standard regimen of neurotoxic chemotherapy. Neurologic phenotype and 
EPR oximetry will be re-assessed at mid-chemotherapy treatment regimen or at the onset of 
symptoms. The assessments will be repeated at the completion of chemotherapy and will 
provide longitudinal data for comparison against baseline characteristics.
Specific Aim #4: In order to develop a proposal for a statistically robust cohort, use pi[INVESTIGATOR_534239] 
(i) inform regarding the feasibility and potential utility of EPR oximetry as a CIPN biomarker, (ii) 
focus on the most sensitive metrics to follow, and (iii) to suggest trends of correlation in sub-
metrics. This study is designed for the collection of preliminary data and to establish the 
feasibility and optimization of the EPR oximetric technique in CIPN. It is anticipated that this 
data will guide a larger study for which additional, external funding will be sought.
Specific Aim #5: Describe changes in serum NFL levels over the course of chemotherapy to 
determine if NFL can be used as a biomarker for axonal damage in patients who develop CIPN. 
NFL will be measured at baseline, before each round of chemotherapy and at the completion of 
chemotherapy. Changes in NFL will be compared between patients who develop CIPN and 
those that do not. 
3 Study Design
3.1 General Design
This protocol is for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_534240] a) strengthen the evidence for using detailed 
clinical and electrophysiological characterization to predict the outcome and incidence of CIPN;  
b) obtain initial data evaluating the role of tissue oxygen as a potential biomarker for CIPN using 
EPR oximetry; and c) establish the feasibility of using EPR oximetry to correlate peripheral tissue 
oxygenation metrics with clinical and electrophysiological indices of CIPN. As a secondary 
objective, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_534241], screening, assessment, 
and retention in order to justify a larger trial in the future. The investigators will aim to enroll thirty 
(30) patients into the study over a one-year enrollment period. Subjects will have three study 
visits: Visit 1, before beginning chemotherapy treatment; Visit 2, mid-treatment; Visit 3, after 
completing chemotherapy. All subjects will undergo a neurologic evaluation and 
electrophysiological assessment in the form of nerve conduction studies and motor conductions 
at each study visit. Patients will have EPR tests at all study visits. 
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints
The primary endpoint identified for the purposes of driving the sample size and primary analysis 
is: the between-groups difference in longitudinal EPR oximetry measures by [CONTACT_534266].
Biomarkers in CIPN page [ADDRESS_693929] will obtain the patient’s consent to be contact[CONTACT_534267]. Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461]. Potential subjects will 
be informed of the objectives and procedures of the study as well as adequately informed of the 
potential risks. Consent will be documented with the use of an IRB-approved consent document, 
and saved in the patient’s electronic medical record. 
4.[ADDRESS_693930] chemo-therapy assessment will be performed. 
Subjects will be withdrawn if they develop an impairment that would interfere with clinical and 
electrophysiologic assessment.
       4.4.2 Data Collection and Follow-up for Withdrawn Subjects
Once a patient has been withdrawn from the study s/he will not be contact[CONTACT_534268]; however, survival data will be collected until one year after 
enrollment.

5.1 A. Description of India ink
India ink (also called ‘Chinese ink’) is composed of carbon particles  (black pi[INVESTIGATOR_534242]) combined with a suspending agent (usually water) to form a liquid. The 
carbon particles used in India inks are usually in the form of a powder mainly comprised of 
amorphous particles of carbon (Bäumler 2015). The India ink used for this study, Carlo Erba ink 
consists of carbon particles from a well-defined charcoal. The SOP with specifics of this ink and 
its preparation, also developed by [CONTACT_534269]’ lab and the same pharmacy in Brussels, is attached 
(SOP 63.2). The company that makes the charcoal preparation (Carlo Erba, headquartered in 
Milan, Italy; manufacturer =Carlo Erba Reagents, Chaussée du Vexin, Parc d'Affaires des Portes 
- BP616) maintains a website with details of the contents of its charcoal products and its safety 
data sheets , 
https://www.carloerbareagents.com/en/catalog/product/view/id/420433/category/[ZIP_CODE].
To be used in EPR oximetry, the carbon particles in ink need to have a detectable EPR signal 
that is affected by [CONTACT_534270] a quantitative and sensitive manner. Due 
to the amorphous 3-dimensional structure of carbon, not all inks made with suspended carbon 
particles have a sufficiently narrow EPR line-width to be usually used for EPR detection of 
hypoxia. Gallez’ laboratory (cf., Charlier et al. 2004, Jordan et al. 1998, and Gallez 2003) has 
conducted a series of experiments to test the EPR signal of various formulations of India ink that 
they manufactured from known samples and following pharmaceutical standards appropriate for 
in vivo human use. They determined that inks made from Printex-U and Carlo Erba have the 
necessary characteristics to be useful for EPR. 
The FDA and its counterparts worldwide have opted not to regulate the manufacture of India 
inks used in cosmetic tattoos or for medical uses in marking, in large part because it has a very 
long established history as a safe product to use in humans. Instead they have agreed to brand 
name [CONTACT_534290], based on the ‘predicate’ of India ink being used in 
humans well before May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or 
to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act that do not require approval of a premarket approval application. 
India ink (Carlo Erba ink) is not a treatment per se. It is a paramagnetic material whose properties 
when queried by [CONTACT_534271]. It is inert and stable 
and permanent and so, after the initial injection and response to a foreign object in the body (i.e., 
akin to tattoo response described above) it permits noninvasive in vivo measurements using EPR 
spectroscopy. Approximately 50micL of sterile India ink, will be injected into the distal fourth dorsal 
interosseous toe web.

Electrophysiologic assessment is performed by [CONTACT_12550] a nerve conduction study 
(NCS). Nerve conductions are obtained using surface electrodes placed on the skin and 
provide a measurement of the speed of conduction of an electrical impulse through a 
nerve. Changes in NCS reflect axonal loss and/or damage to myelin. To perform the test, 
surface electrodes are placed on the skin of the distal extremity. The underlying nerve is 
stimulated with a very mild electrical impulse. This results in an evoked response that is 
recorded from a distal surface electrode. This is repeated for each nerve being tested.

painless. SUDOSCAN has been cleared by [CONTACT_534273] [ADDRESS_693933] visits if 
scheduling conflicts arise or per patient preference. Patients’ chemotherapy progress will be 
monitored in the electronic medical record so that follow up visits can be scheduled during and 
after completion of chemotherapy. Aside from attending and completing the scheduled study 
visits, patients will have no further compliance requirements.

CONFIDENTIAL5.4.1 Storage (Carlo Erba India Ink)
The India ink capsules will be stored at room temperature, in sterile packaging. As available, the 
ink capsules are stored on a continuously rolling platform located in the study treatment room for 
oximetry measurements. A complete sterile kit containing all necessary items for the injection is 
stored in the cabinet space in the same room and clearly marked. The vortexer that is to be used 
immediately prior to injecting a subject is located in the same area as is a camera top record 
injection sites. 
5.4.2 Preparation and Administration of Study Device (Carlo Erba Ink)
This study will follow the EPR Center’s standard protocol for the preparation and dispending of 
India ink. For detailed instructions on the preparation of Carlo Erba ink, please see EPR Center’s 
Standard Method 63.2, “SOP for Preparation of Carlo Erba Ink: For injection in Humans” . Briefly, 
the materials used are purified charcoal Carlo Erba (Cod 332658) (Depyrogenated for human 
use) as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_534244] (NaCl 0.9%) and gum Arabic 2(USP quality) for the aqueous 
suspension. Briefly, the methods can be described as: First create a solution of gum Arabic and 
saline water. Then add the charcoal pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517], then distribute into vials, place in an ultrasonic bath 
and sonicate for 30 sec. Add stopper and cap. Seal and crimp the vials and sterilize the vials at 
121°C for 20 min using the “liquids” program of the autoclave. Add labels to each individual vial 
with pertinent information about the date, use, batch, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], etc.
The methods and materials for making Carlo Erba ink were developed and tested in Brussels 
under the supervision of the Project [ADDRESS_693934] been published (see Jordan et al 1998) and the materials used have already been 
used for more than [ADDRESS_693935]- Luc Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534245] (about 200 
patients/year). Charcoal particles (Carlo Erba, Codex, diameter 3 to 10 micrometer) will be 
suspended (agitation and sonication) using a suspending agent (3% Arabic gum in saline) 
approved for clinical use of parenteral injection. Endotoxins will be removed by [CONTACT_534274] (2 hours at 220° C). Sterilization procedure will be carried out by [CONTACT_534275] 121°C for 20 min. The batches will be prepared in single use 1mL serum bottles with 
rubber stoppers to facilitate the injection procedure. Materials will be released for human use after 
regular quality control tests (sterility) are carried out.
The administration (injection) of the ink is detailed in SOP 71.2 (attached). Only designated 
clinicians who have completed standard in-person training by [CONTACT_534276]. Briefly, these are the steps: in advance of injecting 
the ink, the study team should have in place two vials of India ink, the kit for injection, a camera, 
data collection forms, and the vortexer. Then, for a consented subject, the study physician doing 
the injection should first prepare the site (written here for skin) using 70% alcohol or other 
appropriate skin preparation such as betadine or other preparative skin cleanser. To inject the 
ink, first vigorously shake/mix the ink vial, preferably with a vortex mixer, for at least [ADDRESS_693936] 11, 2016: Listing of ingredients generally 
recognized as safe in Title 21 of the FDA: §582.7330 Gum Arabic. (a) Product. Acacia (gum

~5mm from skin surface. Allow the pressure to stabilize for a few seconds and then, while 
withdrawing the needle, pull back on plunger to minimize ink release in needle track. Then remove 
needle and dispose safely. Clean the injection site of ink using fresh skin cleaner. Mark sites with 
non-permanent ink and photograph site. Offer a band-aid. Record pertinent information on the 
data recording form.
5.4.3 Dispensing of Study Device (Carlo Erba ink)
Regular device reconciliation checks will be performed. Information tracked will include which 
device was injected in a given subject; which device container(s) was opened; whether the subject 
actually received the assigned device; and which device(s) was inadvertently damaged in 
handling/dispensing and therefore not to be used for human subjects. This reconciliation will be 
logged on the device reconciliation form, and signed and dated by [CONTACT_534277].
5.4.4 Return or Destruction of Study Device (ink)
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of the vials of ink that were 
shipped, vials consumed, and vials remaining. This reconciliation will be logged on the device 
reconciliation form, signed and dated. Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and 
documented prior to return or destruction of unused study device. Vials destroyed on site will be 
documented in the study files.

1.2.[ADDRESS_693939]. Testing will be repeated for each 
nerve to ensure verifiable amplitudes. The SUDOSCAN recordings will be made with both the 
patients’ hands and feet. 
Subjects will report to the Department of Radiation Oncology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical 
Center for EPR oximetry. The EPR Center’s established procedures for the injection of India ink 
will be followed. Subjects will receive an injection of ink in the foot over the distal fourth dorsal 
interosseous toe web. Subjects may require [ADDRESS_693940] oximetry measurement procedure consists of acquiring continuous EPR scans to

10 minutes while breathing room air, then ~10 minutes while breathing enriched oxygen by [CONTACT_534279], followed by ~10 minutes while resuming breathing room air. 
6.3 Visit 2
Visit 2 will be scheduled at the onset of CIPN symptoms or at the mid-point of chemotherapy 
treatment. If a patient reports symptoms of CIPN to their nurse or physician, or if the patient’s 
provider suspects CIPN is present prior to midpoint of therapy, the subject will be scheduled for 
Visit 2, in which the electrophysiologic and clinical assessments are standard of care. For patients 
who do not show signs of CIPN by [CONTACT_136112]-point of their treatment, the study staff will coordinate 
a visit for clinical and electrophysiological assessment. These assessments will be identical to the 
tests conducted at Visit 1. 
Patients will also return to the Department of Radiation Oncology for their second round of EPR 
measurements. The continuous EPR will take approximately 30 minutes (~10 minutes breathing

proportion of potential participants that: meet inclusion criteria, consent to participate, and 
complete all assessments. 
Thirty (30) patients will be enrolled in the study, and it has been estimated that ten (10) patients 
will develop CIPN during their taxane treatment. Accurate incidence of CIPN varies significantly; 
the average incidence is 70% (Seretny et al., 2014), with ranges from 30% to 90%. A conservative 
estimate is that 30%-50% of patients in this trial will develop symptoms of neuropathy during their 
chemotherapy treatment. Development of CIPN will be determined based on the results of their 
neurologic assessments. For data analysis, the patients will be divided by [CONTACT_534282]. Primary endpoints are continuous metrics: Endpoint 1) neurological phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_534248] (e.g. nerve conduction, EMG readings, SUDOSCAN 
results), and Endpoint 2) tissue oximetry involves the EPR measures). The mean levels of each 
electrophysiological or oximetry metric will be assessed between the two groups of patients (with 
CIPN vs. without) over time (at timepoints: before, mid-, and post-chemotherapy) using repeated 
measures ANOVA. This method will also assess the within-subject changes in the 
electrophysiological and EPR oximetry metrics over time, from baseline through post-
chemotherapy, as well as the interaction between CIPN status and time. With [ADDRESS_693945] 80% power to detect a between-groups difference in 
longitudinal EPR oximetry measures by [CONTACT_534283] 28%, assuming a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_693946] deviation of 25%, alpha=0.05. The within-subjects and interaction 
tests are estimated to be able to detect an 8.5% change over time, with these same parameters 
(calculated using G*Power [IP_ADDRESS]).
Biomarkers in CIPN page [ADDRESS_693947] p-value 
by [CONTACT_534284]. For primary endpoint 3), we will also use 
Pearson correlation to assess the relationship between metrics, for example, EPR oximetry will 
be assessed vs. a continuous CIPN metric (e.g. nerve conduction, temperature sensation, 
vibratory sensation) within a timepoint, e.g. post-chemotherapy). With n=30 patients, we 
anticipate having 80% power to detect at least a 33% difference in the means of a metric using 
an independent samples t-test comparing patients with CIPN vs. without, or a regression slope of 
0.[ADDRESS_693948] deviation of 0.25, and alpha of 0.05.  This data 
will guide a larger study for which additional, external funding will be sought.   
The potential utility of the EPR measures will be assessed in these CIPN patients using either a 
minimum within-subjects increase over time in the tissue oximetry measure of (e.g. 5%) compared 
to baseline, or a Pearson r threshold (e.g. -0.3) for the correlation between the tissue oximetry 
and electrophysiological measures of sensory or motor nerve conduction. 
8 Safety and Adverse Events
8.1 Definitions
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
•            Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study-related 
documents such as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)
•            Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_3459])
•            Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).
Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events 
if the abnormality:
•            results in study withdrawal
•            is associated with a serious adverse event
•            is associated with clinical signs or symptoms
•            leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests
•            is considered by [CONTACT_534285]-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that 
is: 
•            fatal
•            life-threatening
•            requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]
•            results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
•            a congenital anomaly or birth defect

Version 2.3
CONFIDENTIAL•            an important medical event
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, 
a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm 
in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355]. 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events. 
Adverse Event Reporting Period
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period 
from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow-up.  
Preexisting Condition
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.
General Physical Examination Findings
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet 
the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
Post-study Adverse Event
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], 
the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled 
visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the 
subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation 
in this study.  
Abnormal Laboratory Values
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the 
following conditions is met: 
•            The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality
•            The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity
•            The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534249] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event. 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:

•            Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28690].
8.[ADDRESS_693949] seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped 
under one diagnosis.
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that 
the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events related to study 
procedures only that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to 
determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is 
considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded 
and reported immediately.
Summaries of study enrollments, clinical status, and data will be submitted for regular review. In 
the case of any unexpected adverse events, the patient’s medical record will be reviewed by a 
study physician, and if necessary, the patient will be examined by a study physician and 
appropriate medical action taken. Any unexpected or serious adverse events, or reactions that 
are determined possibly to be related to the study procedures, will be reported to the Dartmouth 
IRB and the FDA as required. 
8.3 Investigator reporting: notifying the Dartmouth IRB
This section describes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_534286], affiliated with a Dartmouth research site, or otherwise responsible for safety reporting to 
the Dartmouth IRB. The Dartmouth IRB requires reporting of those events related to study 
participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of 
harm.  The Dartmouth IRB requires researchers to submit reports of any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets each of the following criteria:
•            Unanticipated in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given: (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved 
research protocol and consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population 
being studied; and
•            Possibly related to participation in the research means there is a reasonable possibility 
that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been associated with research participation; 
and

CONFIDENTIAL•            The problem suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, emotional, economic, legal, or social harms) than was 
previously known or recognized.
Reporting Process
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the 
Dartmouth IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 
(UPR).”
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_28693]’s study file.
Other Reportable events:
For clinical trials, the following events are also reportable to the Dartmouth IRB:
•            Any adverse experience, defined as an untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in 
a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in research, 
whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research), that is considered:
–            Serious: Death; a life-threatening adverse drug experience; inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448]; a persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or a 
congenital anomaly or birth defect; and
–            Unexpected:  Any adverse experience, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current investigator brochure or consent form; and
–            Possibly related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been associated with the procedures involved in the research; and
–            Is experienced by a participant in a trial open at a site subject to Dartmouth IRB review
•            Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. For example: 
–            An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment 
than initially expected.
–            Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent 
than initially expected.
–            A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study 
is of no therapeutic value.
•            Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic 
used in a research protocol.
•            Breach of confidentiality
•            Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research participant.
•            Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].
•            Protocol deviation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB 
approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_445653], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.
Biomarkers in CIPN page [ADDRESS_693950] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study
Who will have access to that information and why
Who will use or disclose that information
The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the 
end of their scheduled study period.
9.2 Source Documents
Source data and original records will be maintained by [CONTACT_534287]-
Hitchcock Medical Center. All source data will be stored in a locked cabinet or office, or will be 
part of subjects’ electronic medical records. Demographics and outcome data of participants in 
the study will be manipulated and stored on a secure, web-based application called REDcap 
and/or shared drive used for the Department of Neurology’s research purposes and managed by 
[CONTACT_534288]-Hitchcock Medical Center. The department 
follows industry standard procedures for securing the computers, servers, and networks 
physically and electronically. REDcap will be used as an electronic case report form. Participants 
will be assigned a random generated number and any identifying information or PHI will be 
removed prior to analysis.
9.3 Records Retention
Electronic data will be stored indefinitely. The physical forms and paper data will be kept for three 
years after completion of the trial.
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_65063] (DSMAC) of 
the Norris Cotton Cancer Center.  The Committee meets quarterly to review accrual rates and 
information for studies that have accrued participants.  The Clinical Cancer Review Committee 
(CCRC) determines the frequency of DSMAC review. The DSMAC has the authority to suspend 
or to recommend termination to the CCRC of all research activities that fall within its 
jurisdiction.  In the event that a study is suspended or terminated, that information will be 
forwarded to the CPHS (Dartmouth IRB) office.

11 Ethical Considerations
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), 
applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, 
for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of 
the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to 
the sponsor before commencement of this study.  The investigator should provide a list of EC/IRB 
members and their affiliate to the sponsor.
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing 
sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study.  See Attachments for a copy of the Subject Informed Consent Form.  This consent form 
will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB for the study.  The 
formal consent of a subject, using the EC/IRB-approved consent form, must be obtained before 
that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_468272], and the investigator-designated research professional obtaining the 
consent.

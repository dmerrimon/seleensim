6 Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of oral VT -1161 in the prevention of culture -verified acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_251105]  50 in RVVC subjects . 
• To compare the efficacy of oral VT -1161 and fluconazole in the treatment of an acute VVC  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_251106]. 
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral VT- 1161 through Week 50. 
Methodology:  
Study Design: 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
VT-[ADDRESS_305333] 12 months, 
as described below:  
• Subjects must have an acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251107], with a documented positive 
potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) performed at the investigative site  
• Subjects must also have had [ADDRESS_305334] (i.e., culture, 
PCR, Affirm test, KOH test, a documented Papanicolaou (Pap) test, or other approved diagnostic 
tests)  
Subjects must also have an acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251108], defined as a total  signs and symptoms score 
of ≥3. 
The study consists of two Phases:  
1) an Induction Phase for the treatment of the acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251109] s ubject s will be randomized 
to receive one of the following:  
• 600 mg VT -1161 (4 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 1 and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 mg capsules) 
on Day 2, or  
• 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of over -encapsulated fluconazole. 
2) a Maintenance Phase in which subjects initially randomized to receive VT -1161 in the Induction Phase 
will receive 150 mg VT-1161 (1 x 150 mg capsule) weekly for [ADDRESS_305335] provided informed consent  or assent (for those ages 12 -17) the investigational site

7 will evaluate al l subjects by [CONTACT_12550] a review of pertinent medical history, obtaining vital signs, 
weight and height, electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory tests, reviewing clinical signs and symptoms 
of vulvovaginitis, performing a complete physical examination including speculum examination of the 
vagina, performing a KOH wet mount test from a vaginal smear to confirm the presence of yeast, and 
collecting vaginal swabs to establish a baseline culture for identification of fungal species.  Eligible 
subjects must have an acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251108], defined as a total signs and symptoms score of 
≥3 and a positive local KOH wet mount preparation from a vaginal smear revealing filamentous 
hyphae/pseudohyphae and/or  budding yeast cells, and must meet other initial entr y criteria.  Once 
eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be randomized to enter the Induction Phase.  
At Screening (Day 1), subjects presenting with an acute infection and meeting all study eligibility criteria 
will enter the Induction Phase where they wi ll be randomized 2:1 ratio to receive either 600 mg VT -1161 
(4 x 150  mg capsules) on Day 1 and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 2, or 3 sequential 
150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of over-encapsulated fluconazole.  Subjects will return approximately 
[ADDRESS_305336] dose of VT-1161 or over -encapsulated  fluconazole to determine if the acute VVC 
infection ha s resolved (defined by a signs and symptoms score of <3).  If the acute VVC has not resolved, 
the subject will be considered a screen failure and encouraged to see their physician for follow- up care.  
All subjects in which the acute VVC infection has resolved will continue into a Maintenance Phase . 
Subjects initially randomized to receive VT -1161 in the Inducti on Phase will  receive 150 mg VT-1161 
(1 x 150 mg capsule) weekly for [ADDRESS_305337]’s Day 1 (Screening ) is defined as the first day of investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
administration and subsequent study days are defined by [CONTACT_251178].

8 Scoring of Vulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms:  
Vulvovaginal signs and symptom s will b e evaluat ed at  Screening and at each subsequent study visit.  
Each of the following vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be scored  and the individual scores 
combined, for a maximum score of 18 using the following scale: 
a. Signs: erythema, edema, and excoriation  
b. Symptoms: itching, burning, and irritation 
 
Scoring Scale: Each score should be graded on a scale of 0 to 3 as follows: 
0 = none (complete absence of any sign or symptom) 
1 = mild (slight)  
2 = moderate ( present ) 
3 = severe (marked, intense) 
 
Mycology Assessment:  
A local mycological assessment using KOH wet mount followed by [CONTACT_251179] (Day 1) and at any study visit where a recurrent acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_41102].  In addition, 
a vaginal swab for culture test ing will be obtained and sent to the central mycology laboratory at the 
Screening and each subsequent study visit.  
Plasma Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples for assay of VT -[ADDRESS_305340] s at participating sites on 
Day 1 and on Day 2, at time points predose and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after dosing.   
Safety:  
Subject safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_251180] (AEs) , changes in vital signs, physical 
and vaginal exam parameters, ECGs, and safety laboratory parameters, including pregnancy tests for 
women of childbearing potential (WOCBP).

Safety:  
All safety analyses will be perfo rmed on the Safety Population.  AEs will be collected throughout the 
study.  Physical and vaginal examination findings and vital signs will be recorded at Screening  and 
throughout the study per Table 1. Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  
ECGs  and safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained throughout 
the study. All concomitant medications taken during the period from 30 days prior to Screening through 
the Week 50 (EOS) visit will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).  Pertinent and all major medical 
conditions will be recorded on the Medical History CRF.    
Subject s who want to discontinue from the study  should be encouraged to remain in the study for all 
remaining visits through Week [ADDRESS_305363] all EOS procedures performed on the day of discontinuation.  
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  
A statistical analysis plan will be finalized before 50% of subjects are enrolled . 
Efficacy Analysis:  
The statistical objective s of this study will be: 
1. To determine if there is a difference in the proportions of subjects with one or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_251125]- verified acute VVC in those receiving VT -1161 compared to those receiving placebo  
2. To determine if there is a difference in the ability of VT- 1161 and fluconazole to resolve acute 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_251126]. 
A sample size of 82 subjects  in the VT -1161 arm and 41 subjects in the fluconazole/ placebo arm provides 
at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference between the VT -1161 treatment group and the 
fluconazole / placebo treatment g roup with a type 1 error rate of 0.05.  Sample size calculation assumes 
50% of the subjects in the placebo arm will have at least one culture- verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251127] -
randomization through Week 50. For the first key secondary endpoint, the proportion of subjects with 
resolved acute VVC infections (clinical signs and symptoms score of <3) at Day 14 following treatment 
with VT -1161 or fluconazole,  a sample size of 120 subjects in the VT -1161 arm and 60 subjects in the 
fluconazole/placebo arm provides at least 88% power to detect non- inferiority between the VT -1161 
treatment group and the fluconazole treatment group with a non- inferiority margin of 15% and a type 1 
error rate of 0.05. The s ample size calculation assumes that 90% of the subjects in the f luconazole arm 
will resolve their acute VVC infection by [CONTACT_2006] 14. 
For the efficacy analyses, missing values for the investigator’s assessment of clinical signs and symptoms 
or the culture result will be imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  For subjects who

26 1 INTRODUCTION 
Lanosterol demethylase (CYP51), an enzyme essential for fungal growth, catalyzes an early step 
in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol, a sterol required for fungal cell membrane formation 
and integrity ( Yoshida, 1988).  Inhibition of CYP51 results in the accumulation of 14- methylated 
sterols, some of which are toxic to the fungus.  CYP51 is the molecular target of the class of drugs 
referred to as ‘azole antifungals’.  All currently approved azole drugs contain either an imidazole 
or triazole ring system that binds tightly to the catalytic heme -iron of fungal CYP51 as well as to 
the heme- iron of many off- target mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes.  This inherent lack of 
selectivity is responsible for many of the side effects associated with the azole antifu ngals.  
For example, the potent inhibition of one or more human cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes 
found in the liver (e.g. CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19) or in the adrenal and sex organs (e.g. CYP19, CYP17, CYP21), is the basis for azole drug -drug interactions ( Bates and Yu, 2003 ) 
and reproductive warnings ( Zarn et al., 2003), respectively.  Additional azole class toxicities that 
are less well understood but may be related to off -target protein in teractions include hepatic 
toxicities, skin photosensitivity, and vision impairment.  In the acute care setting, these dose -
limiting side effects prevent attainment of plasma drug levels that might reduce the longstanding 
40% mortality rate attributed to invasive fungal infections.  The safety profile of the class similarly 
limits its use for chronic treatment of non -life-threatening fungal infections, such as recurrent 
vulvovaginal candidiasis ( RVVC)  and onychomycosis (OM).  A safer antifungal drug would also 
improve treatment options for infections seen in otherwise healthy individuals, such as RVVC and 
OM, which require protracted treatment in a patient population where significant side- effect risks 
are unacceptable.

27 1.1.1 Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  
[IP_ADDRESS] Epi[INVESTIGATOR_251128] (inflammation of the vagina and vulva) are common and are among  
of the most frequent reasons for women’s visits to physicians.  Vulvovaginitis is associated with 
considerable morbidity including genital discomfort, decrease in sexual pleasure, loss of 
productivity, and psychological distress ( Eschenbach, 2004).  There are several  etiologies for 
vulvovaginitis; candidiasis being the second most common after bacterial vaginitis.  Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common disorder, with nearly 75% of all adult women having had at least one 
“yeast infection” in their lifetime.  Approximately half of these women experience a recurrence, 
with 5 to 8% developi[INVESTIGATOR_251129], defined as 3 or more e pi[INVESTIGATOR_251130] ( Sobel, 2016).  
Estrogen increases the glycogen co ncentration of the vaginal lining; glycogen is a substrate on 
which C. albicans  thrives.  As estrogen levels are significantly lower in both pre -menarchal and 
post- menopausal females, the incidence of VVC is lower in these populations.  Vulvovaginal 
candid iasis is most common in women aged 25 to 34 years  (Foxman et al., 2013). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pathophysiology 
Vulvovaginal candidiasis occurs when there is an overgrowth of the normal yeast in the vagina.   
Most cases (85% - 95%) are caused by C. albicans , followed by  C. glabrata, and infrequently by 
C. parapsilosis , C. tropi[INVESTIGATOR_251131] , and C. krusei .  Vulvovaginitis caused by [CONTACT_105]- albicans Candida 
species, in particular C. glabrata, is clinically indistinguishable from C. albicans  VVC but is more 
resistant to current treatments.  
Candida organisms gain access to the lumen and secretions of the vagina primarily from the 
adjacent perianal region.  Normal anti -Candida defense mechanisms allow for long -term 
persistence of Candida as com mensal organisms in the vagina without signs or symptoms of 
vaginitis.  Factors predisposing to VVC versus asymptomatic colonization include those attributed to the health (immunosuppression, use of antibacterial agents, pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) and behavior (frequent intercourse, orogenital sexual activity, use of oral contraceptives 
or estrogen- based hormonal replacement therapy) of the host.  Other dermatologic conditions such 
as psoriasis, lichen planus, and lichen sclerosus also predispose women to VVC  (Goncalves et al., 
2016). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Presentation and Diagnosis 
The clinical array of signs and symptoms of VVC include genital pruritus associated with edema, 
an erythematous rash and excoriation of the vulva and surrounding skin, a burning sensation in the vagina and vulva, and a vaginal discharge.  These symptoms may persist for days to weeks and  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 Product:  VT-[ADDRESS_305384] commonly present 
with acute pruritus and a vaginal discharge, though neither is specific for candidiasis.  
The discharge may range from being watery to quite thick and “cottage -cheese-like”.  
Common symptoms include vaginal soreness, irritation, vulvar burning, dyspareunia, and external dysuria.  Phy sical examination typi[INVESTIGATOR_251132] a pustulopapular rash, vaginal erythema, and a normal cervix.  Symptoms often worsen the week prior to menses. 
The diagnosis of VVC requires more than a history and physi cal examination as symptoms and 
signs, in particular pruritus, are often non- specific.  Diagnosis is made by [CONTACT_251184] a 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount showing the presence of yeast cells and mycelia 
and the absence of both clue cells (pathognomonic of bacterial infection) and trichomonads.  The vaginal pH is normal, approximately 4.0%.  A vaginal culture should also be performed, 
particularly for women with negative microscopy, as up to 50% of patients with culture -positive 
VVC wi ll have no findings on microscopy ( Sobel, 2007); additionally, a culture will p recisely 
identify the organism . Papanicolaou  (Pap)  smears are also not reliable, typi[INVESTIGATOR_251133] a 
quarter of patients with VVC.  
As up to 15% of asymptomatic women are colonized with Candida species and are thus culture 
positive, the final diagnosis of VVC requires a comprehensive assessment of clinical findings, microscopic examination, and vaginal culture. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment and Outcome 
In general, women who are asymptomatic carriers of Candida do not require treatment.  
Acute VVC in symptomatic women requires individualized treatment, the selected agent and 
duration of therapy being based on whether the VVC is categorized as either:  
• Uncomplicated, defined as having all of the following characteristics: (mild or moderate in 
symptom severity, sporadic in frequency, C. albicans as the infecting organism, in non-
pregnant women with normal immune function), or 
• Complicated, defined as having any one or more of the following characteristics: severe in 
symptom severity, recurrent, a non -C. albicans  organism as the infecting agent, abnormal 
immune function, or pregnant ( Eschenbach, 2004).  
Women with uncomplicated VV C can be treated with single -dose or short -course treatments, while 
those with complicated VVC require longer- term therapy, at least [ADDRESS_305385]:  VT-1161   
 
Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-017 IND 111675

of developi[INVESTIGATOR_251134], can only be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_251135].  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_251136], especially burning, and are messy to apply; therefore,  most patients prefer the oral regimens.  
However, the systemically administered azoles listed in Table 2 are characterized by [CONTACT_251185] -drug-interactions (DDIs ) and  have poor activity against C. glabrata and 
fluconazole resistant C . albicans .

[IP_ADDRESS] Recurrent, Resistant and Non -Albicans VVC 
Up to 20% of women will develop recurrent, resistant, or complicated VVC.  In a study that 
compared a 6 -month maintenance weekly fluconazole regimen to placebo in patients with 
recurrent VVC, the time to recurrence increased from 4.0 to 10.2 months, and the cure rate at 
12 months doubled versus placebo from 22% to 43% (Sobel et al., 2004).   However, fewer than 
half of patients remained disease- free after discontinuation of fluconazole which highlights the 
unmet medical need for these patients.  
The prevalence of infection with non- albicans species, in particular C. glabrata, is increasing, 
especially in patients who are immunosuppressed and/or are diabetics; C. glabrata is poorly 
sensitive to current azole antifungal agents. 
1.2 VT-1161 
VT-1161 is a novel oral antifungal agent with a lower affinity for heme -iron and a greater affinity 
for the fungal lanosterol 14 α- demethylase (CYP51) than the currently available azole drugs.  
As a result, VT -[ADDRESS_305386]:  VT-[ADDRESS_305387].

In the Phase 2b RVVC study (VMT -VT-1161- CL-006), 413 clinical isolates were collected from 
subjects at screening visits until the end of the study.  The minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) ranges for VT -1161 and fluconazole for the isolates collected were; <0.0005  – >0.5 µg/ml 
and <0.06- 32 µg/ml, respectively.  The MIC 50 values for VT -1161 and fluconazole were 
0.004 µg/ml and 0.125 µg/ml, respectively, and the MIC 90 values for VT -1161 and fluconazole 
were 0.06 µg/ml and 4 µg/ml, respectively. These data further demonstrated that VT -[ADDRESS_305390] the Candida strains obtained from  clinical strains.  For all tested 
isolates, VT -1161 demonstrated MIC 50 and MIC 90 that were 5 dilutions lower than those 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_251186].   
[IP_ADDRESS] Activity in Animal Models of VVC  
VT-1161 was evaluated as an oral treatment of vaginal candidiasis ( C. albicans ) in a murine model 
(Garvey et al., 2012).  Three days after infection, VT -1161 was dosed orally once daily at 4, 10, 
or 25 mg/kg daily for 4 days.  Fungal burden measured in vaginal lavage fluid was highly 
significantly suppressed (p <0.0002) compared to vehicle -treated controls at all doses and when 
measured [ADDRESS_305391] dose 
of VT -1161 indicated that levels as low as 1 µg/mL resulted in this high degree of efficacy.

VT-1161 accumulated during repeat -dosing in rats and dogs as expected based on the long 
half-life.  VT -1161 was widely distributed into tissues and was mostly excreted in bile and feces 
in the rat.  In vitro plasma protein binding of VT -1161 is high with approximately 99.5%  binding 
to rat, dog and human plasma and slightly lower binding in mice (97.6%).  The absolute oral 
bioavailability of the capsule formulation used in Phase 1 studies administered to dogs was 
approximately 40% in the fasted state and approximately 100% when administered in the fed state.  
[IP_ADDRESS] General Toxicology 
Oral VT -[ADDRESS_305393] level (NOAEL) for the 6 -month rat toxicity study was determined to be 0.5 mg/kg/day, 
based on an increase in incidence and severity of chronic progressive nephropathy, a  rat-specific 
finding.  The NOAEL for liver findings was 1.5 mg/kg, based on adverse findings at the high dose of 5 mg/kg/day including a minimal increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and an increase in frequ ency of minimal focal necrosis and 
single cell necrosis.   Findings of liver hypertrophy, sub- capsular necrosis and multinucleated 
hepatocytes were considered rat -specific and associated with metabolic adaptation.   Focal necrosis 
may be an exaggerated respo nse to hepatocellular hypertrophy which is known to cause 
sub-capsular and single cell necrosis.   The findings were reversible and similar to  the findings 
observed in a prior 28 -day study in the rat, providing support that the increased treatment duration 
in the 6-month rat study did not result in new findings of clinical concern.  At the 1.5 mg/kg dose 
at steady state on Day 182, maximum plasma concentration ( C
max) was 4,055 ng/mL and area 
under the curve ( AUC 0-24) was 81,900 ng·h/mL.  The NOAEL for the 9 -month dog study was 
determined to be the high dose of 17 mg/kg/day (Day 273 C max was 74,700 ng/mL and AUC 0-24 
was 1,675,000 ng·h/mL), as no adverse findings were identified.  The NOAEL in the previous 28-day dog study was 10 mg/kg/day, based on decreased body weight and mild effects on 
lymphoid organs including increased tingible body macrophages in the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes and in the Peyer’s patches at 30 mg/kg and higher.  These findings were largely 
reversed during the recovery period.

33 [IP_ADDRESS] Reproductive Toxicology 
VT-1161 at doses resulting in maternal toxicity (clinical signs and decrease in body weights) did 
not cause alterations in uterine and ovarian pa rameters in embryofetal development studies in rats 
and rabbits.  Mean fetal body weights were slightly reduced in rabbits in the high dose group as a 
direct result of maternal toxicity and decreased maternal body weights.  No external, visceral and 
skelet al malformations and variations were observed at any of the dose levels evaluated.  
There were no effects on male or female fertility at clinically relevant doses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Pharmacology 
The effects of VT -1161 on the neurological and pulmonary systems were evaluated in 
Sprague -Dawley rats.  The data demonstrated that there were no VT ‑1161- related effects in either 
the neuropharmacological or pulmonary studies in rats given an oral dose of up to 1,000 mg/kg VT-1161, the highest dose tested.  
Evaluation of cardi ovascular function in telemetered dogs revealed no treatment -related changes 
in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm or morphology, including the QT/QTc  (Fridericia 
correction) interval, at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. 
[IP_ADDRESS] In Vitro Cytochrome P450 Interactions  
VT-1161 inhibited cytochrome P450 enzymes with the following potencies:  
CYP1A2  (half maximal inhibitory concentration [ IC
50] ≥10 µM), CYP2B6 (IC 50 = 4.0 µM), 
CYP2C8 (IC 50 = 1.4 µM), CYP2C9 (IC 50 ≥10 µM), CYP2C19 (IC 50 = 9.7 µM), 
CYP2D6  (IC 50 = 9.4 µM), and CYP3A4 (IC 50 = 9.6 µM [testosterone], IC 50 ≥10 µM [midazolam]).  
Based on the high plasma protein binding of VT -1161, no clinically significant drug -drug 
interactions are expected.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Effects of VT -1161 on Cardiac Repolarization 
An in vitro  human ether -à-go-go related gene study was conducted to assess the potential of 
VT-1161 to inhibit the repolarizing current of the cardiac action potentia l.  VT -1161 inhibited the 
human ether -à-go-go related  gene potassium current by 94.7 ± 1.3% at 6 µM.  The  IC50 was 
calculated to be 1.9 µM (Hill coefficient = 2).  However, a cardiovascular safety study in dogs 
showed that VT -[ADDRESS_305395] doses of up to 300  mg/kg, the highest dose tested, with exposures 
reaching 24,000 ± 6,881 ng/mL at [ADDRESS_305396]:  VT-1161

34 1.2.2 Clinical Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1  Studies  
VT-1161 has been evaluated in 4 Phase 1 trials, a single ascending dose  trial, a multiple ascending 
dose trial , a DDI study with midazolam as a sensitive substrate , and an ethnic  PK study comparing 
Japanese and Western subjects.  The primary objectives of these studies were to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability , PK and drug interaction potential of VT -1161 in healthy adult subjects.  D etailed 
descriptions of the trials can be found in the VT-1161 I nvestigational Brochure . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Single  Dose -Escalation Study (Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-001) 
Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-001 was a single -center, Phase 1, double- blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled, dose -escalating study in healthy adult subjects.  The study was designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of single oral doses of VT -1161.  Sixty -four subjects (43 males and 
21 females) between [ADDRESS_305397] 7 cohorts, 
escalating single oral doses (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 mg) or matching placebo were administered in the fasted state.  An 8th cohort received a single [ADDRESS_305398].  Subjects in Cohorts 1 to 6 were followed 
for 14 days for safety and PK assessments.  Visits on Days 28 and 42 were added for Cohorts 7 and 8.  Dose escalation proceeded only after safety and PK of the previous dose was determined.   
There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported.  There were no treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that led to discontinuation from the study.   Overall, mean changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, vital 
signs, and electrocardiogram [ECG]s) were generally small and were considered not clinically significant.  None of the  treatment -emergent physical examination abnormalities were of clinical 
significance.  The maximum tolerated dose for the study was the highest dose administered, 320 mg, administered in the fed state.  
Following oral administration of VT ‑1161 in the fasted  state, median time to reach maximum 
plasma concentration (T
max) ranged from 4 to 10 hours.  Overall, C max increased slightly less than 
proportional to dose. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC
inf) values generally increased with increase in dose, ranging from an average of 
16,145 ng•hr/mL at 20 mg to 241,971 ng•hr/mL at [ADDRESS_305399]:  VT-1161   
 
Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-017 IND 111675  
       Version 2, 1 7 January 2019 
 
35 of subjects.  Average fasting C max was 338 ng/mL and this increased to 988 ng/mL in the fed state.  
AUC inf also increased from 241,971 ng•hr/mL  when subjects were fast ed to 953,119 ng•hr/mL 
with a high -fat meal.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Multiple  Dose -Escalation Study (Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-002) 
Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-[ADDRESS_305400] TEAEs were mild in intensity and no severe TEAEs 
were reported.  
Mean changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, coagulat ion, urinalysis, 
vital signs, and ECGs) were generally small and not considered clinically significant.  There was 
no evidence of any clinically significant effect of VT -[ADDRESS_305401] dose 
administered, 320 mg, administered once daily  for 7  days in the fed state.  
Following oral administration of VT -1161 in the fed state, median T max values ranged from 4 to 
6 hours after dosing.  The increase in mean C max was nearly proportional to dose over the 40 to 
320 mg dose range.  The concentrations were 3 to 4- fold higher on Day 7 than they were on Day  1, 
indicating accumulation during the 7- day dosing interval, with a mean C max of 3,300 ng/mL on 
Day 7 at 320 mg.  The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing 
interval (AUC τ) values on Day 7 also increased nearly proportionally to dose over the 40 to 320 mg 
dose range.  The mean half -life ranged from 1,905 to 3,046 hours.

36 was conducted 30 minutes after the start of a high- fat, high- calorie meal.  A total of 36 subjects 
were enrolled in the study.   
In the DDI cohort, 28 subjects were enrolled in a fixed- sequence design to receive a 2 -mg oral 
dose of midazolam on Day 1, followed by 14 daily 600 mg oral doses of VT ‑1161 (4 x 150 mg 
tablets) on Day [ADDRESS_305403] dose of study drug.  Twenty -four subjects in the DDI cohort completed the study and 4 subjects 
withdrew from the study prior to completion; 2 subjects voluntarily withdrew consent and 
2 subjects withdrew due to an AE (discussed in more detail below).   
There were no deaths reported in the study.  One SAE (acute psychosis) was reported in a subject 
in the DDI cohort on Day [ADDRESS_305404] dose of VT -1161; the Investigator assessed causality as unrelated to study drug.  Otherwise, mean 
changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, vital 
signs, and ECGs) in both the DDI and PKE cohorts were generally small and not considered clinically significant and there was no evidence of any clinically significant effect of VT -1161 on 
physical examinations in either cohort.  
In the DDI cohort, midazolam mean plasma C
max increased 30% and AUC inf decreased 15% on 
Day 3 (after the first dose of VT ‑1161) relative to Day 1 (midazolam alone).  Midazolam mean 
plasma  Cmax decreased 3% and AUC inf decreased 37% on Day 16 (after 14 daily doses of VT ‑1161) 
relative to Day 1 (midazolam alone).  
In the PKE cohort, 8 subjects were enrolled to receive a single 600 mg oral dose of VT-1161 (2 x 300 mg tablets) on Day 1.  Subjects in the PKE cohort were followed for safety, tolerability and PK assessments through Day 2, 1 day after the dose of study drug.  All 8 subjects in the PKE 
cohort completed the study.  VT -1161 mean plasma C
max and AUC 0-24 values after a single oral 
adminis tration of 600 mg VT ‑1161 (2 x 300 mg) on Day 1 were 1,946 ng/mL and 
28,070 ng•hr/mL, respectively.  These values are similar to VT -1161 mean plasma C max and 
AUC 0-24 values after a single oral administration of 600 mg VT ‑1161 (4 x 150 mg) in the DDI 
cohort (1,994 ng/mL and 25,330 ng•hr/mL, respectively), indicating the bioavailability of the [ADDRESS_305405]:  VT-1161

Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-[ADDRESS_305406] was withdra wn from the study for a n AE of  rash 
(subject request), which was categorized as an unlikely -related TEAE.  There was [ADDRESS_305407].  
Of the 51 subjects enrolled in the study, 11 Japanese subjects from both dose groups and 12 Western subjects from both dose groups were included in the full PK analysis population. Trough concentrations on Days 1 through 14 rose each day; thus, steady -state conditions had not 
been met by [CONTACT_2006] 14.  Larger differences between the 2 ethnic groups were seen in C
max and 
AUC 0-72 following the 300 mg dose compared with the 600 mg dose. At the 300 mg dose, C max and 
AUC 0-72 were approximately 40% higher in Japanese subjects com pared with Western subjects. 
At the 600- mg dose, C max and AUC 0-72 were approximately 10% higher in Japanese subjects 
compared with Western subjects. However, median T max was similar across doses at 4 hours for 
Japanese subjects at both the 300 mg and 600 mg dosages and 6 hours for Western subjects at both the 300 mg and 600 mg dosages. The terminal elimination phase was very flat and half-life 
exceeded 1800 hours. Total clearance following the 300- mg dose was 1.642 L/hr for the Japanese 
subjects compared wi th 2.332 L/hr for the Western subjects.  Following the 600 mg dose, clearance 
was similar for the Japanese and Western subjects (2.000 and 2.086 L/hr, respectively).

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Dose Ranging Study in Tinea Pedis (Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-003) 
VMT -VT-1161- CL-003 was a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, dose -ranging study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of VT -1161 over -encapsulated tablets compared to placebo in the treatment 
of subjects with moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis.  A total of 50 subjects participated in 
the study across 4 dose groups: 1) VT -1161 200 mg once daily  for 4 days, followed by 50 mg once 
daily  for 10 days  (low dose) ; 2) VT -1161 600 mg once daily  for 4 days, followed by 150 mg once 
daily  for 10 days  (mid -dose) ; 3) 600 mg twice daily  for 4 days, followed by 300 mg once daily  for 
10 days  (high dose ; or 4) placebo matching the VT -1161 treatment regimen.  VT-1161 plasma 
concentrations increased with dose and were as high as 6,230 ng/mL on Day 14 in the 600 mg 
twice daily/[ADDRESS_305408] of cure ( TOC ) 
visit (Day 42) of the [ADDRESS_305409] AEs reported were mild to moderate in severity  and considered unrelated to 
study drug .  A single VT-1161 treatment related AE was reported (rash) that was considered by 
[CONTACT_251187] “possibly related.”  The subject discontinued treatment after the first dose, 
and the rash completely resolved by [CONTACT_53016].  There were no clinically significant 
treatment -emergent changes in vital signs, physical findings, ECGs, or la boratory parameters.  
One subject experienced a significant elevation of creatine kinase ( CK) along with a slight increase  
in ALT and AST that was associated with a rigorous exercise program.  These changes were 
considered unrelated to treatment and all en zyme levels returned to normal at a subsequent follow -
up visit.   
At the Day 42 TOC visit, 42%, 42%, 50% and 0% of subjects receiving low dose, mid- dose or 
high dose VT -[ADDRESS_305410] achieved effective therapeutic cure 
(defined as  having a total severity score of ≤2 with no individual severity score of >1, and also, 
having negative mycology [culture and KOH]) in the intent- to-treat ( ITT) population.

3) 600 mg twice daily  for 3  days, or 4) a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg followed by [CONTACT_251188].  Subjects were enrolled into the high- dose cohort following an interim analysis that 
included safety data generated through the TOC visit (Day 28) of the [ADDRESS_305412] TEAEs were reported in the low - and mid- dose cohorts and only 1 TEAE 
(insomnia) was noted in the high -dose cohort.  One subject developed urticaria that was considered 
possibly related to study drug and which resolved with prednisone.  There were no clinically 
significant treatment- emergent changes in vital signs, physical findings, ECGs or laboratory 
parameter s. 
The efficacy of VT -1161 in the treatment of moderate -to-severe acute VVC was evaluated at the 
TOC visit in the ITT population (defined as all randomized subjects receiving at least 1 dose of study drug) and the per protocol ( PP) population (defined as s ubjects that were compliant with all 
key aspects of the protocol).  Subjects in the ITT population were randomized into the 
VT-1161 300 mg once daily  for 3 days (n = 14), VT -1161 600 mg once daily  for 3  days (n  = 12), 
VT-1161 600 mg twice daily  for 3 days (n = 14) or fluconazole (n =  15).  Effective clinical cure 
rate (defined as having a total severity score of 0 or 1 and a negative culture) were 29%, 83%, 86% and 73%, respectively.  Subjects in the PP population achieved effective therapeutic cure at a rate of approximately 87%, 86%, 86% and 75%, respectively, in the low -dose, mid- dose, or high -dose 
VT-1161 or fluconazole groups at the Day 28 TOC visit.

• High dose 24- week: Loading doses of 600 mg once daily for 2 weeks, then 600 mg once weekly 
for 22 weeks. 
• Matching placebo 
Subjects in all cohorts were followed for 60 weeks.  Consenting subjects were enrolled into an 
extension study to assess the long- term safety and PK of VT -1161 through Week 96.   
The incidence of  adverse events  (AEs) was balanced across the VT -1161 treatment arms and 
placebo.    A total of 148 subjects (57%) had at least 1 TEAE, and the frequency was within the range of 49% to 67% for all treatment groups.  The majority  of TEAEs were considered by [CONTACT_251190].  Most TEAEs were transient and 
occurred during the first 12 weeks of treatment for all treatment groups, including placebo.  Nineteen subjects reported related TEAEs through Week 60.  Sixteen subjects were on VT-1161 
and three subjects were on placebo.  The only related TEAE reported by [CONTACT_726] 2 subjects was 
nausea.  Eleven subjects reported a total of 16 SAEs, which were considered unrelated to study 
drug.   
The incidence of study drug related TEAEs was wi thin the range of 6% to 11% for all treatment 
groups, with the highest frequency in the [ADDRESS_305414] common (≥2 total 
subjects) TEAEs that were considered related to VT -[ADDRESS_305415] common TEAE that was considered related to 
placebo was dizziness.  
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was low, in the range of 0% to 6% 
for all treatment groups. 
There were no clinically -relevant findings noted by [CONTACT_251191], physical 
exam findings or ECGs. There was no obvious clinically -relevant effect of VT -[ADDRESS_305416]:  VT-[ADDRESS_305417] population being studied and were generally balanced across the 
VT ‑1161 treatment a
nd placebo group. 
The primary ef
ficacy endpoint was complete cure at Week 48.  The proportion of subjects in the 
ITT population with complete cure at Week 48 ranged from 32% to 42% in the VT -[ADDRESS_305418] rate in the 300 mg 12–week treatment group and the highest rate in the 
600 mg 12–week treatment group. No subjects receiving placebo experienced complete cure at 
Week 48.  The proportion of ITT subjects with complete cure was statistically significantly higher 
for all VT -1161 treatment groups compared with placebo at Week 48 (p<0.001). 
Overall, the efficacy at Week 48 was clearly demonstrated in all the VT -1161 treatment groups, 
with little to no improvement seen in the placebo group.   
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Phase 2b Study in Subjects  with Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis 
In this Phase 2b study, the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy of VT -1161 in subjects with 
recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis was evaluated.  A total of 215 subjects participated in the study , 
were randomized to 5 treatment groups and were administered either:  
• Low dose 12- week: Loading doses of 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly 
for 11  weeks, followed by [CONTACT_251189] 12 weeks. 
• Low dose 24- week: Loading doses of 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly 
for 23  weeks.  
• High dose 12- week: L oading doses of 300 mg once daily for 7 days, then 300 mg once weekly 
for 11  weeks, followed by [CONTACT_251189] 12 weeks. 
• High dose 24- week: Loading doses of 300 mg once daily for 7 days, then 300 mg once weekly 
for 23  weeks.  
• Matching placebo  
In general,  the incidence of AEs was balanced across the VT -[ADDRESS_305419]:  VT-[ADDRESS_305420] of VT -1161 on chemistry, 
hematology or urinalysis parameters.  
The primary e
fficacy outcome measure was the proportion of subjects with one or more culture -
verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251137] 48 of the study  in the 
ITT population.   Culture- verified acute VVC was defined as a positive fungal culture for Candida 
species associated with a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3.   The proportion of subjects 
with one or more culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251138] 48 was  lower in VT ‑1161 
dosing regime
ns: 4.8% in 150 mg 12 weeks, 7.0% in 150 mg 24 weeks, 0.0% in 300 mg 12 weeks, 
and 4.9% in 300 mg 24 weeks, treatment group s compared with 52.2%  in the placebo group. 
The difference was statistically significant in the VT ‑1161 dosing regim
ens compared with 
placebo (p<0.0001). 
In conclusion, VT -11
61 was determined to be efficacious, safe and well tolerated at all dose levels 
through the final visit at Week 48 of the study.

46 3 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion of subjects with one or more culture -
verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (post -randomization through Week 50) in the ITT population, which 
will include the subjects who failed clearing their infection during the Induction Phase .  An acute 
VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (considered a recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) is defined as a positive culture for Candida species 
and a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥3.  
Secondary:  
• The proportion of subjects with resolved acute VVC infections (clinical signs and symptoms 
score of <3) at Day 14 following treatment with VT -1161 or fluconazole. 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251123] ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase (Post Day 14 through W eek 50). 
• Time to first recurrence of a culture- verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251140] ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase (post Day 14 through Week 50 ). 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture for Candida during the 
Maintenance Phase.

12 months, as described below:   
• Subjects must have an acute  VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251107],  with a documented 
positive KOH performed at the investigative  site 
• Subjects must also have had [ADDRESS_305429] (i.e., culture, PCR, Affirm test, KOH test, a documented Pap  test, or other approved 
diagnostic test)  
The study consists  of two Phases: 1) an  Induction Phase  for the treatment of the acute VVC 
infection in which subjects will be randomly assigned to receive  with either 600 mg VT -1161 
(4 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 1 and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 2 and 
matching placebo capsules or 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of  over-
encapsulated  fluconazole together with matching placebo capsules , and 2)  a Maintenance Phase in 
which subjects will receive VT -1161 or placebo  for 11  weeks and will then enter a 3 7-week follow -
up period. 
Once subjects hav e provided informed consent  or assent (for those ages 12-17), the investigational 
site will evaluate all subjects  by [CONTACT_12550] a review of pertinent medical history, obtaining vital 
signs,  weight and height, ECG and laboratory tests, reviewing clinical signs and symptoms of 
vulvovaginitis, performing a complete physical examination including speculum examination of 
the vagina, perform ing a KOH wet mount test from a vaginal smear  to confirm the presence of 
yeast , and collect ing vaginal swabs to establish a baseline culture for identif ication of fungal 
species .  Eligible subjects will have a composite vulvovaginal  signs and symptom score of ≥[ADDRESS_305430]:  VT-1161   
 
Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-017 IND 111675  
       Version 2, 1 7 January 2019 
 
48 Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be randomized and enter the Induction P hase.  
During the Induction Phase, t he presenting acute VVC infection  will be treated with either 600 mg 
VT-1161 (4 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 1 and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 2 
or 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of  over- encapsulated  fluconazole.  Subjects 
will return approximately [ADDRESS_305431] dose of VT-1161 or over- encapsulated fluconazole 
for evaluati on and, if the acute VVC infection has resolved (defined by a signs and s ymptoms 
score of <3), they will  enter into the Maintenance Phase to receive either VT -1161 or a matchi ng 
placebo regimen .  Day 1  (Screening ) is defined as the first day of investigational medicinal product 
(IMP)  administration and subsequent study days are defined by [CONTACT_251192].   If the acut e VVC has not resolved (defined by  a signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3), the 
subject will be considered a n Induction failure and encouraged to see their physician for further 
evaluation and follow- up care.   
4.2 Treatment Arms and Duration of Study  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_305432] participation will be approximately 50 weeks: including the 
2-week Induction Phase, the 11- week Maintenance Phase,  and [ADDRESS_305433]. 
4.3 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 360 screened and 180 randomized subje cts are planned for this study.  Assuming 
a 20% discontinuation rate for the remainder of the study, approximately [ADDRESS_305434]:  VT-1161   
 
Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-017 IND 111675  
       Version 2, 1 7 January 2019 
 
49 The fluconazole dosing regimen to be employed in the Induction Phase is in alignment with the 
recommendation proposed by [CONTACT_251193] (IDSA) for the treatment 
of vulvovaginal candidiasis, in which fluconazole, 150 mg, is given every 72 hours for a total of 3 
doses. This is recommendation is strongly supported by [CONTACT_251194]- quality evidence 
is available to support its clinical effectiveness.  
VT-1161 has previously been evaluated in a Phase 2a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, 
active- controlled, parallel -group, dose -ranging study in patients with moderate -to-severe acute 
VVC (described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2).  A total of 55 subjects with moderate -to-severe acute VVC 
(severity score ≥[ADDRESS_305435]) participated in the study across 4 dose groups:  
1) VT -1161 300 mg qd for 3 days; 2) 600 mg qd for 3 days; 3) 600 mg bid for 3 days; or 4) a single 
dose of fluconazole [ADDRESS_305436] of cure TOC visit was, 87%, 86%, 86%, and 75% of subjects receiving the low , mid- , or high -dose VT -1161 or comparator arm of 
fluconazole , respectively, achieved an effective therapeutic cure (defined as having a total clinical 
signs and symptoms severity score of ≤1 and a neg ative culture for Candida species) in the Per 
Protocol population 
It is predicted based on plasma levels obtained in previous clinical studies that the proposed 
loading dose regimen of 600 mg on Day 1 and 450 mg on Day 2 will provide for clinically effecti ve 
plasma levels  (approximately 2 µg/mL) to treat the presenting acute Candida spp. infection a 
manner that will afford comparison of the efficacy of oral VT -[ADDRESS_305437] been studied previously in subjects with onychomycosis 
(VMT -VT-1161- CL-005), with a maximum high dose of 600 mg once daily for 2 weeks, then 600 
mg once weekly for 22 weeks administered (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3). 
The proposed VT-1161 dosing regimen for the current Phase 3 studies  will also  incorporate a 
150 mg once weekly maintenance dose phase for 11 weeks.  Based on the PK results from the 
Phase 2b study, it is expected  that this will provide a mean plasma concentration of approximately 
2.5 µg/m L at the end of the dosing period (Week 14).

50 4.4.1 Justification for Inclusion of Adolescents in the Study  
Vulvovaginal candidiasis, a nd especially RVVC, is rare in pre- menarchal girls (typi[INVESTIGATOR_251141] e-
adolescents less than 12 years of age) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_251142]. 
Adolescent females (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive) represent a menarchal population that is newly 
influenced by [CONTACT_251195]. The changes in reproductive hormones in adolescents cause  
vast changes in tissues and may increase the susceptibility to VVC . In this population, cases of 
VVC and RVVC exist but are substantially less common than in adult females. While 75% of 
healthy women will likely experience one epi[INVESTIGATOR_251143] , and potentially 9% 
will be characterized as having recurrent disease, the prevalence of symptomatic acute VVC in 
adolescents is less than 2% of the population and there is no published data that addresses the 
incidence of RVVC in this patient population ( Fidel, 2002; Blostein, 2017; Barousse, 2004). 
Presenting symptoms of VVC in menarchal adolescents are similar to those in the a dult population, 
and treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_251144] ( Joishy, 2005 ).  The dose and administration of the 
agents us ed in adolescents are the same as those used in adult females with VVC and RVVC.  
The [LOCATION_002] FDA Draft Guidance Vulvovaginal Candidiasis: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_251145] -menarchal  girls, 
post-menarchal adolescent girls with VVC should be included in Phase 3 trials.  Accordingly, the present study will follow guidance received by [CONTACT_251196] 12 to 17 years of age (inclusive) to collect as much information as possible 
on the treatment of the adolescent population with RVVC.

is unable to comply with the excluded medications criteria  (Section 7.4.1) , the subject’s continued 
participation in the study will be re -evaluated by [CONTACT_737] , in consultation with Mycovia  
Pharmaceuticals’ Medical Monitor.  
7.[ADDRESS_305475] who receives ≥1 dose of study drug will be considered evaluable and will not be 
replaced.  
7.7 Randomization and Blinding  
A randomized design through an interactive web response system  (IWRS)  will be used to assign 
subjects in a 2:1 ratio to the dose regimen  of VT -1161 or fluconazole and placebo.  Day 1  
(Screening ) is defined as the first day of VT -1161/fluconazole a dministration and subsequent study 
days are defined by [CONTACT_251178].  
The subjects, study I nvestigators and their staff, all clinical staff  members within Mycovia  
Pharmaceuticals , the c linical study monitor, the study project team, and the study Medical 
Monitor (s) will remain blinded to individual treatment assignments until the completion of the 
study.  The Unblinded Statistician responsible for creating the final randomization list and the 
IWRS personnel responsible for loading  the final randomization list into the IWRS  will be 
unblinded to the treatments .  The bioanalytical personnel responsible for assay of VT -[ADDRESS_305476]:  VT-1161

63 7.8 Conditions for Breaking the Blind  
In the event the breaking of the blind is required, the following will apply: 
• The Investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an 
emergency  (i.e., a Grade 4 AE)  OR in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge 
of the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the 
subject as judged by [CONTACT_737]  (ICH GCP 4.3.1) .  If the SAE requires that an expedited 
regulatory report be sent to [ADDRESS_305477]’s treatment assignment, may be sent to Investigators in accordance with local regulations. 
• The Investigator must contact [CONTACT_251202]’s treatment assignment 
immediately after the unblinding occurred (ICH GCP 4.7). 
• If unblinding is required, t he Mycovia Pharmaceuticals’ Medical Monitor  and the Investigator  
will be provided with the treatment assigned to the  subject. The Investigator  mus t NOT 
disclose the treatment assignment to the subjec t and/or other study personnel including other 
site personnel, monitors,  or the Sponsor ’s project team ; nor should there be any written or 
verbal disclosure of the code in any of the corresponding subject documents.  The treatment 
assignment of the subject is to be revealed only if  that information is important to the safety of 
subjects currently in the study. 
• The date and reason for unblinding must be fully documented in t he eCRF.  
7.9 Treatment After the End of the Study  
After the completion of the study, Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  will follow local 
regulatory/ International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) guidelines for any follow -up 
treatment provided to subjects.  The Investiga tor is responsible for ensuring that consideration has 
been given to the post-study care of a subject’s medical condition.

9.[ADDRESS_305499], regardless of causal relationship. 
A “pre -existing” condition is one that is present prior to the start of I MP administration  and is 
reported as part of the subject ’s medical history.   Pre-existing conditions should be reported as 
AEs only if the frequency, intensity, or character of the pre-existing condition worsens during the study. 
Any abnormal safety assess ments , such as ECGs, radiological  scans, vital sign measurements,  
that are judged by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to be clinically significant should be recorded as an AE or 
SAE provided it meets one of those definitions.  Laboratory abnormalities generally are not 
considered AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs or symptoms or  require medical 
intervention.  A laboratory abnormality (e.g., a clinically significant change detected on 
clinical chemistry, hematology) that is independent from a known underlyin g medical 
condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to IMP interruption or 
discontinuation, should be considered an AE.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
associated with the disease being studied are not considered AEs unless their severity is greater 
than expected in the judgement of the Investigator .  
In addition, the following apply: 
• All AEs, including clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities, will be documented 
as an AE and followed until resolution.

83 • All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the start of taking the first dose of  IMP until 
the last follow -up visit of the study, at the time points specifie d in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
• Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of IMP but after obtaining informed 
consent or assent (for those ages 12- 17) should be recorded in the medical history 
section of the eCRF.  
• Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects.  
However, if the Investigator learns of an SAE, including a death, at any time after a 
subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably 
related to the study treatment o r study participation, the Investigator must promptly 
notify Mycovia Pharmaceuticals .

• Requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacityc 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/ birth defect

intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above .  Example:  allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home. 
NOTES:

c. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
All SAEs, regardless of causal relation ship, must  be reported to Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals 
(or designee) within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event.  The initial report must be 
captured in the electronic SAE CRFs within 1 business day. 
The SAE report should provide as much of the required informa tion as is available at the time.  
The following minimum information is required for reporting an SAE: subject  identification  
number , reporting source, and an event outcome.  Supplemental information may be entered 
into the electronic SAE CRFs  and should not delay the initial report.   Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  
(or designee) may contact [CONTACT_115996] -
up on the event. 
If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information will be 
treated as an SAE for the purposes of this protocol. All SAEs will be follow ed until resolution, return to baseline (when worsening of a pre -existing 
condition is reported), or permanent documented change in medical history. All relevant documentation pertaining to the SAE (additional laboratory tests, consultation 
reports, discharge summaries, post -mortem reports, etc .) will be provid ed by [CONTACT_251204]  (or designee) in a timely manner.  
9.2.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
Subjects  should be instructed to report all AEs to the Investigator.  In addition, the Investigator 
should seek to elicit any clinical or objective reactions by [CONTACT_31463]- ended questioning (“How have 
you been feeling?”) and, as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  All AE information obtained during 
the subject questioning should be documented in the subjects’ clinical records and entered into 
the CRF.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and results of diagnostic procedures performed because of an AE should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis.  The component parts of the diagnosis may be listed for verification.  If the AE is a laboratory 
abnormality that is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 Product:  VT-[ADDRESS_305502] ’s own 
words.  Each AE will also be described in terms of duration (start and stop date), severity, 
association with the IMP, action(s) taken, and outcome. 
9.2.4 Severity of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_251205], according 
to the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases ( DMID ) Adult Toxicity Table, (Draft, 
November 2007) Appendix A .  For AEs involving a body system or laboratory value which is 
not addressed in the DMID Adult Toxicity Table, the most recent version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.[ADDRESS_305503]  and lower limit of normal (LLN)  laboratory ranges occur 
between those included in the DMID and those of the central laboratory that performs the 
assays, the values provided by [CONTACT_251206].  
For AEs involving a body system or laboratory value not addressed in the DMID Adult 
Toxicity Table, the following general scale may be used with I nvestigator discretion to assign 
severity:  
• GRADE 1 Mild : An event easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] ; transient or mild discomfort 
(usually <  48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required. 
• GRADE 2 Moderate : An event that may interfere with normal, everyday activities; some 
assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required.  
• GRADE 3 Severe : An even t that prevented the subject  from performing their normal, 
everyday activities; some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy 
required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125]. 
• GRADE 4 Life -threatening : At the time of the event the subject  was at risk o f death or 
the event resulted in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity.

       Version 2 , 17 January 2019  
 
86 • GRADE 5 Death : An event that resulted in death. 
When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
severity for the experience that  day should be noted. If the severity category changes over 
several  days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
NOTE: An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a 
category utilized for rating the intensity of an event (such as mild, moderate, or severe 
myocardial infarction).  However, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance, (such as a severe headache), and both AE(s) and SAE(s) can be assessed as severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as 
described in  Section 9.2.2.

• The site must counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.  
• In cases where the subject is deemed ‘lost to follow -up’, the I nvestigator or designee must

• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, only then will they be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up”. 
A subject may be withdrawn due to lack of tolerability or safety concerns, including study 
drug- related AEs or development of clinically -significant study drug -related  laboratory 
abnormalities.  If a subject is withdrawn from treatment, the subject must be followed clinically until the event is resolved or deemed stable. A subject must be discontinued from the study drug if ALT or/and AST is > 5 times  the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or/and AST is

94 12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
A formal SAP will be finalized before 50% of subjects are enrolled .  The SAP  will provide a 
more technical and detailed description of the proposed data analysis methods and procedures. 
Any deviation from the analyses outlined in the protocol will be described in the SAP. 
The primary statistical objective s of this st udy are:  
1. To determine if there is a difference in the proportions of subjects with one or more 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_251165]- verified acute VVC  in those receiving  VT-1161 compared to those 
receiving placebo; and  
2. To determine if there is a difference in the ability of VT -1161 and fluconazole to resolve 
acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_251166] . 
12.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The study will enroll 180 total subjects (120 in the VT -1161 arm and 60 in the 
fluconazole/placebo arm).  For the primary efficacy endpoint determination, a  sample size of 
82 subjects in the VT -1161 arm and 41 subjects in the fluconazole/ placebo arm  provides at 
least 9 0% power to detect a treatment difference between the VT -1161 treatment group and 
the fluconazole / placebo treatment group with a type 1 error  rate of 0.05. (PASS 2008: Fisher's 
exact test, two -sided alpha  = 0.05, and assuming 50% of placebo subjects have 
recurrence).   For the first key secondary endpoint, the proportion of subjects with resolved 
acute VVC infections (clinical signs and symptoms score of <3) at Day 14 following treatment 
with VT -1161 or fluconazole, a sample size of 120 subjects in the VT -1161 arm and 60 subjects 
in the fluconazole/placebo arm provides at least 88% power to detect non- inferiority between 
the VT -1161 treatment group and the fluconazole treatment group with a non- inferiority 
margin of 15% and a type 1 error rate of 0.05. (PASS 2008: Z -test for two independent 
proportions, one -sided alpha = 0.025, non- inferiority margin = 15%, and assuming that 90% 
of fluconazole subjects resolve their acute VVC infection).     
12.2 Analysis Populations  
ITT Population: All randomized subjects.  
Safety Population: A ll randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of IMP.

outcome. 
• Were compliant with the assigned study treatment, defined as ≥80% compliance  
during the Induction P hase and ≥50% compliance during the weekly dosing phase. 
• Had the Week 50 visit completed within the  acceptable time window  (±14 days) . 
• Had no major protocol violations that would impact treatment outcome. 
Modified ITT:  All randomized subjects who had the following: 
• Positive  KOH at S creening.  
• Positive culture  at Screening.  
• Negative culture at Baseline.  
All statistical populations will be defined in the SAP.  
12.3 Missing Data  
For the efficacy analyses, missing values for the Investigator’s assessment of clinical signs and 
symptoms or the culture result will be imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  
For subjects who discontinue the study early and have missing assessm ents for all visits after 
discontinuation, the missing values for the expected scheduled visits will be imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  The missing values will be imputed using the following 
auxiliary information: region, treatment, baseli ne BMI, baseline age, ethnicity, and visit.  
The procedure PROC MI in SAS will be used to generate [ADDRESS_305517] of missing data on the results. The details of these sensitivity analyses will be outlined in the SAP.   
12.4 Multiple Testing  
If the comparison for the primary endpoint is significant (two- sided p -value < 0.05), then 
testing will continue for the key secondary endpoints. To control for the type  I error rate at 
0.05 for multiple secondary endpoints, the hierarchical/gate -keepi[INVESTIGATOR_251167].

12.6 Efficacy Analyses  
Clinical and mycological assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion of subjects with one or more  culture-
verified  acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (post- randomization through Week 50) in the ITT population, 
which will include the subjects who failed clearing their infection during the Induction Phase . 
An acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (considered a recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) is defined as a positive culture for 
Candida species and a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥[ADDRESS_305519]:  VT-1161   
 
Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-017 IND 111675  
       Version 2 , 17 January 2019  
 
97 The key secondary efficacy outcome measures include the following: 
• The proportion of subjects with resolved acute VVC infections (clinical signs and 
symptoms score of <3) at Day 14 following treatment with VT -1161 or fluconazole. 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251168] ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase (post Day 14 through 
Week 50). 
• Time  to first recurrence of a culture -verified acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251169] ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase (post Day 14 through Week 50).  
• The proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture for Candida during the 
Maintenance Phase. 
 
The secondary endpoint of the proportion of subjects with resolved acute VVC infections at 
Day 14 in the VT -1161 arm will be evaluated for non- inferiority versus the fluconazole arm.  
A non- inferiority margin of 15% will be used.  If the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval 
for the difference in proportions between the VT -1161 arm and the fluconazole arm is greater 
than -15% then non- inferiority will be claimed.  
Justification of the non- inferiority margin :  Fluconazole clears  80% of acute VVC 
infections.  Women can clear a VVC infection without intervention only when the infection is 
mild and even then , the complete clearance of the infection  is very rare.   Thus, a conservative 
estimate for the effect of fluconazole to treat a  VVC infection versus no intervention is at least 
70% (assuming 10% clear with no intervention).  Per the FDA guidance document on Non-
Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness, a non -inferiority margin that is half the 
effect of the control drug should be used.  A non- inferiority margin of 15% was selected for 
this trial which is equivalent to approximately 21% of the effect of fluconazole, which is 
substantially less than the recommend ed use of 50% of the effect  of the control drug for the 
non-inferiority margin .   
The secondary endpoints  of the proportion of subjects with at least one culture -verified acute 
VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_251170], and the proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture for Candida during the Maintenance phase , will be analyzed using a similar 
method as the primary efficacy outcome. The secondary endpoint of time to first recurrence will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method. Subject’s with no recurrence will be

12.7 Safety Analyses  
To meet the safety dataset  requirement, approximately 150 subjects will be screened to 
randomize approximately 180 subjects that would meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria. 
Assuming a 20% discontinuation rate, it i s expected that approximately [ADDRESS_305521] dose of  IMP through Week 50 (EOS).   Physical 
examination findings, vital signs, ECGs and safety laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry) will be obtained throughout the study as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments and 
Procedures .  All concomitant medications taken during the period from 30 days prior to 
Screening through the Week 50 (EOS) visit will be recorded in the CRF.  Pertinent and all 
major medical cond itions will be recorded on the Medical History CRF.   
For subjects discont inuing early from the study, every effort will be made for all EOS 
procedures to be performed as outlined in the  Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  
AEs will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA

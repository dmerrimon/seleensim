PRÉCIS 
Background:  
• Standard treatment for advanced Ka posi’s sarcoma (KS) is a liposomal anthracycline, 
plus antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with HIV.  
• KS is not curable and relapses are common. Prolonged use of liposomal anthracyclines 
with cumulative dosing exceeding 550 mg/m2 is frequently required.  
• KS is notable for pathogenic autocrine and paracrine VEGF signaling. The monoclonal 
antibody, bevacizumab is a rational agent for the treatment of KS.  
• Preliminary results from our phase II study of bevacizumab monotherapy, 03-C0110, suggest that beva cizumab has promising activity in the treatment of KS. 
• The combination of anti-angiogenic therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy has been a 
successful strategy in KS as well as other solid tumors.  
• This pi[INVESTIGATOR_453432].  
A goal of this combination strategy is to develop a tolerable and highly active regimen that would limit the need for prolonged anthracycline use.  
Objectives:  
• The primary objective is to estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of six cycles of liposomal doxorubicin combined with bevacizumab in patients with advanced KS. 
Eligibility:  
Inclusion criteria:  
• Age ≥18 
• Biopsy proven KS 
• Indication for chemotherapy 
• Any HIV status  
• Normal MUGA  
• Able to tolerate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg  
• SBP <150, DBP <90 
• Urine protein < 1+ or 
500mg/24hrs  Exclusion Criteria:  
• Surgery within 4 weeks  
• Thrombo- embolic disease  
• Chemotherapy within 3 weeks 
• Hemoptysis or severe gastrointestinal bleeding, unless caused by [CONTACT_84465] 
• Pregnancy or breast feeding  
Design:  
• This is an open label, single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_61724] 2 cohorts. Cohort 1:  HIV negative, HIV 
infected with stable KS despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 1 year of HAART with HIV viremic control, or HIV infected with progressive KS despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 4 months of HAART with HIV viremic control. Cohort 2:  All other patients with advanced AIDS -associated KS.

3 • Subjects will receive bevacizumab 15 mg/kg and liposomal doxorubicin 20 mg/m2 
every 3 w eeks until complete response (CR) or a maximum of 6 cycles. Those with 
stable disease or better will continue on bevacizumab 15 mg/kg monotherapy every 3 
weeks for 11 cycles. HIV infected subjects will receive HAART.  
• ORR will be calculated with 80% CI for each cohort separately. If estimates in the two 
cohorts are similar (p>0.30 by a Fisher’s exact test), they may be combined to form a somewhat more precise estimate of ORR after 6 cycles of treatment.  
• A total of 10 evaluable patients will be accrued in each cohort.

1.2 B
ACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) is a multif ocal angioproliferative malignancy histologically consisting of 
proliferative endothelial cells with enhanced vascular permeability, an inflammatory component, 
and a proliferation KSHV infected spi[INVESTIGATOR_86858]. The γ -herpes virus, Kaposi’s sarcoma-
associated  herpes virus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus- 8 (HHV -8), is a necessary 
but insufficient cause of KS, while HIV is an important co- factor, which markedly increases the 
risk for the development of KS. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_578278] line therapy for HIV -associated KS is combination anti- retroviral therapy (HAART). The 
effectiveness of HAART in the management of KS is likely due to control of HIV viremia and 
improved KSHV specific cellular immunity 1, 2.  Regression of KS lesions has been reported with 
HAART.  However, in patients with advanced or symptomatic disease, chemotherapy is indicated.  Cytotoxic agents with modest efficacy in KS include bleomycin, vincristine, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and etoposide, whereas paclitaxel
3, [ADDRESS_578279] improved response rates over older agents.  Liposomal preparation of doxorubicin may improve delivery of doxorubicin to the vascular lesions of KS

Version Date : 01/16/[ADDRESS_578280] line cytotoxic agent based on phase III studies (conducted prior to 
widespread availability of HAART) demonstrating overall response rates (ORR) of 46-59%, which were superior to combination chemotherapy. Liposomal anthracyclines also offer reduced toxicity 
5, 6  and improved quality-of-life compared to doxorubicin, bleomycin and vincristine 
(ABV)9.  Studies of liposomal doxorubicin conducted after the introduction of HAART have 
demonstrated an ORR of 55-76% 10-12, and liposomal doxorubicin has retained its high 
therapeutic index in long term follow- up of patients treated in the HAART era.  However, KS is 
not curable, and one-year progression -free survival with either liposomal doxorubicin until best 
response (median number of cycles = 9) or 6 cycles of liposomal doxorubicin plus IL12 followed by [CONTACT_8668]-12 maintenance is approximately 70% 
11, 13. Long-term administration of chemotherapy is 
often required.  An approach to advanced KS that employs combination bio-chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_453466]12 followed by [CONTACT_8668]12 alone.  In this study, the median number of cycles required to obtain a partial response was [ADDRESS_578281] are 9 times more likely to develop a second cancer than the general population, and 75 times more likely to develop non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
16.  Estimates of death 
due to KS in the HAART era are available from recent KS treatment studies as well as from the Mortalité 2000 Study Group, which performed a national survey of causes of death among 
people with HIV performed in [LOCATION_009] in 2000
17.  For patients that require chemotherapy, 
approximately 3-8% of patients will die of KS within 12 months, despi[INVESTIGATOR_453433].11, 13.  Furthermore, an additional 9% died of second malignancies during phase IV 
evaluation of liposomal doxorubicin.11  In the Mortalité 2000 Study of 964 deaths among people 
with HIV in [LOCATION_009] in  2000, 28% of all  deaths were related to malignancy, and 15% of 
malignant deaths were due to KS, 39% were due to NHL, 1% was due to cervical cancer, and 45% were due to non-AIDS defining malignancies
17. 
Given the dramatically improved survival of patients with HIV after the introduction of HAART and the tendency for KS to recur, long- term toxicities must be considered.  While cardiotoxicity 
associated with liposomal doxorubicin is less frequent than that with doxorubicin, long- term 
treatment with liposomal doxorubicin (at 20mg/m
2 per cycle) in the management of KS often 
leads to cumulative dosing greater than 550 mg/m2 11.  The long- term cardiac toxicity of 
prolonged exposure to liposomal doxorubicin in this population is unknown.  Symptomatic heart 
failure occurred in less than 1% of 754 patients with KS treated on clinical trials. (Doxil 
prescribing information).  However changes in echocardiograph findings have been noted in 
11% of women with breast cancer treated with 50 mg/m2 of liposomal doxorubicin to a 
cumulative dose of > 450 mg/m2, which has lead to a Black Box Warning for cumulative 
liposomal doxorubicin doses approaching 550mg/m2.  (Doxil  prescri bing information).  
Additionally, endomyocardial biopsies performed on patients who had received cumulative doses > 400 mg/m

8 (Billingham scale Grade 1) myocyte damage in [ADDRESS_578282] demonstrated that KS depends on autocrine and paracrine signaling through multiple pathways.  Early work demonstrated that various KS cell lines expressed bFGF mRNA levels 6 -8 times that of HUVEC cells. Cultured 
media from KS cell lines was able to stimulate both HUVEC and KS cell growth, while anti -
bFGF Ab inhibited this paracrine signaling
18. Shortly thereafter, it was noted that KS 3 and KS4 
cell lines, derived from pleural effusions, also expressed elevated levels VEGF 121 and VEGF 165, 
two isoforms of VEGF- A derived from alternative splicing19. Using in-situ radiolabeled mRNA 
probes in biopsy samples from AIDS- KS ca ses, VEGF 165 mRNA was increased in spi[INVESTIGATOR_453434] (compared to granulation tissue) but not in tumor endothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry for VEGF
165, on the other hand, demonstrated high levels on the 
endothelial cells20.  As the case with bFGF, cultured media of AIDS -KS cell lines also has high 
levels of VEGF -A, and anti- VEGF antibodies inhibit the HUVEC proliferation that occurs in the 
presence of AIDS -KS cell line cultured media. Furthermore, anti -bFGF Ab  and anti- VEGF -A 
antibodies are synergistic in inhibiting paracrine signaling21.  Evaluation of VEGFR- [ADDRESS_578283] VEGFR -3 expression in these cell lines

Immunohistochemical and radiolabeled staining of KS biopsy samples confirmed VEGFR-3 expression on spi[INVESTIGATOR_453435].
28-30. When KSHV infected HUVEC cell 
cultures are compared to uninfected HUVEC cultures, increases in mRNA by [CONTACT_937] -PCR for 
VEGF A, B, C, and D as well as VEGFR- 1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 are noted, and IHC 
confirmed the strong expression of all three receptors in the KSHV infected HUVEC cells26.  For 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_453436], additional proliferative pathways through VEGFR-3 appear to also be important.

GPCR leads to cells that produce VEGF -A 
31, 32.  Cultured media from these transfected cells 
support HUVEC cell cultures, while anti -VEGF -A antibodies inhibit proliferation. Furthermore, 
inoculation of these transfected cells in nude mice leads to the formation of vascular tumors with histological features of KS. Evaluation of intracellular signaling cascades using kinase assays demonstrate that v -GPCR induces JNK and p38 but not MAPK
31. A VEGF -A luciferase reporter 
in this model demonstrates that the upregulation of VEGF depends on a hypoxia response element (HRE) in the VEGF promoter. v -GPCR stimulated upregulation of VEGF is associated 
with p38 phosporylation and stabilization of HIF-[ADDRESS_578285] with 25% amino acid homology to human IL-6. Transfection of v -IL6 into NIH 3T3 also leads to 6- 8 fold increases in VEGF -A mRNA. 
Subcutaneous injection of v- IL6 transfected NIH3T3 cells in nude mice also leads to spi[INVESTIGATOR_453437]
35. 
The K1 gene of KSHV encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein related to the immunoglobin receptor family with a constitutively active signaling through an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine -based activation motif (ITAM). K1 transgenic mice develop plasmacytoid and 
sarcomatoid tumo rs
36, and the lymph nodes from the K1 transgenic mouse show high levels of 
VEGF -A by [CONTACT_9064].  A lymphoma cell line derived from tumors from the K1 
transgenic mouse, KVL -1, produce high levels of VEGF in cultured supernatants. Tr ansfection 
of K1 into various B- cell lymphoma cell lines also lead to increased VEGF compared to the 
same cell lines transfected with a K1 -mutant that lacked the ITAM sequence37. In an endothelial 
cell model, K1 tra nsduction into HUVECs leads to immortalized cell that produce high levels of 
VEGF -A through increased transcriptional activity. As in the KLV-[ADDRESS_578286] that K1 
transfected endothelial cells activate VEGFR -2, with downstream signaling occurring through 
the PI3K/Akt pathway. KS tissue array from the AIDS and Cancer S pecimen Resource was 
stained with polyclonal anti-K1 antibody. While some tumors only expressed LANA, others expressed both LANA and K1
39, supporting the potential role of K1 in the pathogenesis of 
AIDS -associated K S. 
LANA, which is a latent KSHV gene may also have an effect on VEGF transcription. 293T cells transduced with LANA have a dose dependent increase VEGF-A transcription and increased VEGF -A in cell culture supernatant
40. The ability of LANA t o affect VEGF -A expression may 
be due to effects on HIF-1.  Co- immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_453438] -1α in transduced 293T cells, and immunoflouresence studies show that LANA and 
HIF-1 co- localize in the nucleus of the PEL cel l line, BCBL -1.  In 293T cells transfected with 
LANA, HIF -1 promoter luciferase assays and RT -PCR demonstrate enhanced transcription of

Version Date : 01/16/[ADDRESS_578287] that LANA is a regulator of HIF -1α, 
and may enhance HIF -1α transcriptional activating activity in the setting of hypoxia41.  
Evaluation of these molecular pathways offer insight into the redundant mechanisms by [CONTACT_453467] -A in KS, and 
provides rational for targeting VEGF- A in the treatment of KS.   
Anti-angiogenic approaches to the treatment of KS are also supported through early phase 
clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_453468] (HAMB).  Phase I and II studies conducted by [CONTACT_453469]

agents with pleiotropic effects that include potential anti -angiogenic mechanisms of action. In 
these studies, we demons trated ORRs of 40 -70%.  More recently, we have been evaluating 
approaches employing anti -VEGF monoclonal antibodies in a Phase II study of bevacizumab 
(03-C- 0110) in patients with classical or AIDS -associated KS that was stable or progressing on 
HAART.  Be vacizumab (rhuMAb VEGF) is a recombinant humanized anti -VEGF monoclonal 
antibody composed of human IgG1 framework regions and antigen-binding complementarity-determining regions from a murine monoclonal antibody (muMAb  VEGF  A.4.6.1) that blocks binding of human VEGF- A to its receptors.  Approximately 
93% of the amino acid sequence, including most of the antibody framework, is derived from human IgG1, and ~7% of the sequence is derived from the murine antibody.  In vitro binding studies have shown it to consistently and potently neutralize the biologic activities of human VEGF -A, including the endothelial cell mitogenic activity, the vascular permeability -enhancing 
activity, and the angiogenic properties in the chick chorioallantoic membrane
44.  This antibody 
has been shown to recognize all isoforms of VEGF -A, with a K d of ~8 ×  10–10 M. muMAb 
VEGF  A.4.6.1 is specific for VEGF- A; it fails to recognize other peptide growth factors tested 
(fibroblast growth factor, epi[INVESTIGATOR_328452], hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived 
growth factor, and nerve growth factor).   
1.2.[ADDRESS_578288] been conducting a 
phase II study of the humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, in patients with KS.  Study subjects are administered bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  Interim review of our phase II study of single agent bevacizumab, which has enrolled 17 patients, demonstrates a 
somewhat promising ORR, preliminarily estimated at 22%, with 1 -year progression free survival 
estimated at 40% (Unpublished data).  As shown in Table 1, bevacizumab was reasonably well 
tolerated in this setting. While the response rate of bevacizumab monotherapy in KS is modest compared to cytotoxic therapy, this level of activity is comparable to that seem in other solid malignancies when used as monotherapy. Phase II studies that have evaluated bevacizumab monotherapy have demonstrated ORR of 16- 21% in platinum resistant ovarian cancer
45, 46, 10% 
in patients with renal cell carcinoma that progressed after IL -247, and 7% in previously treated 
breast cancer48.

benefit of bevacizumab when combined with cytotoxic agents, has been demonstrated in several other solid tumors. Bevacizumab increases progression -free survival when used alone or in 
combination with interferon- α in patients with renal cell carcinoma
47, 49 or in combination with 
paclitaxel (but not capecitabin e50) in patients with previously treated breast cancer51. 
Furthermore, the addition of bevacizumab to standard cytotoxic regimens in both lung and colo-rectal cancer has lead  to improvements in progression- free and overall survival when compared 
to cytotoxic therapy alone 
52-55.  Our previous phase II study of liposomal doxorubicin with IL-12 
13 demonstrated an ORR of 83%, further supporting the rationale of combination anti-angiogenic 
and cytotoxic chemotherapy in advanced KS.  Given a strong preclinical rationale, and the promising activity of bevacizumab as monotherapy in patients with KS that was stable or progressing on HAART, we hypothesize that a combination of liposomal doxorubicin, which has demonstrated efficacy in causing tumor regression, with bevacizumab that targets VEGF signaling, will provide a platform that may lead to improved overall response rates, time to response and progression free survival in patients. This combination could potentially offer an important therapeutic option for patients with advanced and difficult to control KS. 
We further hypothesize that in addition to being a highly active combination, that liposom al 
doxorubicin combined with bevacizumab, at the dosing schedule used in our phase II study, will 
be safe and tolerable, and may potentially to decrease anthracycline requirements in the management of patients with advanced KS.

bevacizumab 15mg/kg combined with the R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone). Two of the [ADDRESS_578291] cancer with neo-adjuvant bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in combination with doxorubicin 50 mg/m

hypertension was observed in 8 patients, and 5 patients had surgical wound healing complications.  Other toxicities were acceptable.  Two patients had an asymptomatic decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction after a cumulative doxorubicin dose 300 mg/m
2.  Of the 2 
patients, one had normalization of her ejection fraction 3 weeks after completing therapy, while the other had normalization in 6 months after discontinuing therapy and starting an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor
57. Lastly, D’Amato et. al. evaluated the combination of 
bevacizumab 15 mg/kg combined with bolus doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 as second -line therapy in 17 
patients with metastatic sarcoma.  Patients were evaluated by [CONTACT_453470] 2 cycles, and 4 patients were removed  from study due to asymptomatic Grade 2 decreases in ejection 
fraction, while 1 patient developed grade III congestive heart failure after 11 cycles and 1 patient grade IV congestive heart failure after 8 cycles of the combination. In 5 of these 6 patients, the ejection fraction improved after cessation of therapy.  Overall, this data suggests that the combination may be associated with reversible asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction at lower cumulative doses of anthracycline.

1.2.4 Bleeding and Thrombotic risk with bevacizumab in Relation to Patients with Kaposi 
Sarcoma and/or HIV 
Bevacizumab has been associated with both bleeding and thrombosis in clinical studies. The risk of these appears to depend in part on tumor type and location, and the optimal strategy to mitigate these risks, including the possible role of thromboprophylaxis, remains unclear. 
Overall, grade 3 and 4 events associated with bleeding or hemorrhage were observed in 4.0% of 
1,[ADDRESS_578293] been observed in bevacizumab clinical studies were predominantly tumor -associated hemorrhage and minor 
mucocutaneous hemorrhage. Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage/hemoptysis has been observed primarily in patients with squamous cell NSCLC, and the majority of these occurred in patients with additional bleeding risk factors such as tumor cavitation and/or necrosis
53. Serious 
tumor associated  bleedings have also been observed in patients with pancreatic cancer, gastric 
cancer, central nervous system (CNS) metastases, hepatoma, or varices treated with bevacizumab. GI hemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melena have similarly been reported in patients with colorectal cancer
52.  
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
13 Across all bevacizumab clinical trials, mucocutaneous hemorrhage has been seen in 20% -40% of 
patients treated.  These were most commonly NCI -CTC Grade [ADDRESS_578294] also been less common events of minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage in other locations, such as gingival bleeding and vaginal bleeding. 
The risk of arterial thromboe mbolic events (ATE) is increased with bevacizumab therapy; such 
events included cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction (MI), 
and other peripheral or visceral arterial thrombosis
60.  A pooled analysis of five randomized 
studies showed a two -fold increase in these events (3.8% vs. 1.7%)60.  ATE led to a fatal 
outcome in 0.8% patients with bevacizumab (vs. 0.5% without bevacizumab).  The rate of cerebrovascular accidents (including TIA) was 2.3% vs. 0.5%, and the rates of MI 1.7% vs. 0.7%.  Certain baseline characteristics, such as age and prior arterial ischemic events, appear to confer additional risk.  In patients >65 years treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy, the rate of ATE was approximately 8.5%. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a standard therapy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of ATE in patients at high risk of such events, and the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ≤[ADDRESS_578295] the risk of ATE were inconclusive.  Further analyses of the effects of concomitant use of bevacizumab and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33931]. 
In the phase 3 trial in metastatic colorectal cancer, there was also a slightly higher rate of venous 
thromboembolic events (VTE), including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and 
thrombophlebitis), in patients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared with 
chemotherapy alone (19% vs. 16%)52.  The incidence of NCI-CTC Grade≥3 VTEs in one 
NSCLC trial (E4599) was higher in the bevacizumab-containing arm compared to the 
chemotherapy control arm (5.6% vs. 3.2%). In clinical trials a cross all indications, the overall 
incidence of VTEs ranged from 2.8% to 17.3% in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared to 
3.2% to 15.6% in the chemotherapy control arms. The use of bevacizumab with chemotherapy does not substantially increase the risk of VTE compared with chemotherapy alone. However, 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who receive bevacizumab and experienced VTE may be at higher risk for recurrence of VTE.  
The baseline risks of bleeding and/or thrombosis associated with KS and HIV play an important part in estimating the potential risk of bleeding and/or thrombosis with bevacizumab therapy, but for KS these risks are not well established. HIV infection is established as a thrombotic risk factor (particularly when poorly controlled or associated with comorbidities), and an elevated risk of bleeding has not been reported in patients with HIV
61-62. In KS, in our clinical practice 
mild bleeding from involved sites has been observed in patients with GI and/or pulmonary KS (Yarchoan, per sonal communication), but bleeding rates have not been estimated. Such bleeding 
is commonly asymptomatic (i.e. noted by [CONTACT_453471]), and usually responds promptly with institution of KS- directed therapy. Evidence regarding thrombotic risk in KS is mi xed. One case 
series in the pre -HAART era, of patients with relatively severe KS, reported an increased 
incidence of thrombosis in limbs affected by [CONTACT_84465]
63. This has not been confirmed, and in more 
recent studies of thrombotic risk in patients with HIV, KS h as not emerged as an independent 
risk factor 61,62,64 (also, Musselwhite and Sereti, personal communication). One case-control study 
in post- transplant KS showed an increased occurrence of DVT in KS cases, but the small number 
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
14 of cases and long time elapsed between KS and DVT (over 2 years) raise the possibility that this 
finding was coincidental65. Nonetheless, it would not be unexpected that the peripheral venous 
stasis and endothelial damage that may been seen in patients with extensive KS, combined with  
effects of HIV in those with HIV -associated disease, could elevate thrombotic risk. One 
superficial vein thrombosis was seen over 202 cycles of therapy in the HAMB phase 2 study of bevacizumab in KS (04-C-0110)., Bleeding in that study included epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (5%) and heavy menses (1 patient). Given the generally mild nature of observed bleeding, possible elevated thrombotic risk with HIV and KS, and potential severity of thrombotic complications, we will employ thromboprophylaxis with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_453439].  This practice is common in current bevacizumab studies. Patients with recent bleeding not directly related to KS and/or a history of bleeding diastheses will not be eligible, nor will patients with known procoagulant disorders.

3. STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
This is an open label, single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_453441].  
3.1.1 Cohort 1: Patients who are either:  
[IP_ADDRESS] HIV negative  
[IP_ADDRESS] HIV infected with stable KS despi[INVESTIGATOR_453442]  
[IP_ADDRESS] HIV infected with progressive KS despi[INVESTIGATOR_453443]: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
19 3.1.2 Cohort 2: All other patients with advanced AIDS- associated KS  
The primary objective is to estimate the ORR of the combination of liposomal doxorubicin and 
bevacizumab after [ADDRESS_578310] of a loading dose of bevacizumab followed one week later by [CONTACT_453474] a maximum of six cycles.  Subjects with stable disease, partial response or complete response after the induction phase will be continued on maintenance bevacizumab for 11 cycles. See Figure 1 for a schema of the dosing schedule. 
3.2.1 Induction Phase 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg will be infused over 90 minutes as a loading dose on Day 1 
of Cycle 1, one week prior to initiation of the combination of bevacizumab and liposomal doxorubicin  
[IP_ADDRESS] On Day 8 of Cycle 1, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg will be infused over 60 minutes (as 
long as no adverse reactions incurred during the first infusion) prior to liposomal doxorubicin. See section 8.1.4. for dilution and mixing instructions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] On Day 1 of Cycl es 2-6, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg will be infused over 30 minutes (as 
long as no adverse reactions incurred during the first two infusions) every 3 weeks 
prior to liposomal doxorubicin. See section 8.1.4. for dilution and mixing 
instructions.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to each dose, blood pressure measurements should be obtained in the 
outpatient clinic and should not be repeated in the chemotherapy suite immediately prior to drug administration to avoid “white coat hypertension” that could be induced if measurements are taken in the chemotherapy administration suites immediately prior to drug administration.  For SBP > 160 or DBP > 100 delay administration and repeat blood pressure measurement no sooner than 30 minutes later.  If parameters remain elevated above these levels, bevaci zumab will not be 
administered, and the responsible physician Investigator(s) will be notified. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to each dose, urine dipstick for protein must be obtained.  If ≥ 2+, a 24-hour 
urine for protein must be obtained prior to dose administration. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Liposomal doxorubicin 20 mg/m
2 will be administered by [CONTACT_453475] 
30 minutes every 3 weeks. See section 8.2.4. for dilution and mixing instructions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to liposomal doxorubicin administration, a CBC with differential should be 
obtained.  Liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab should be held for an absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) < 750 / µL or a platelet count less than 75,000 / µL. 
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
20 3.2.2 Maintenance phase  
Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg will be infused over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for a total of 11 cycles .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to each dose, blood pressure measurements should be obtained in the 
outpatient clinic and should not be repeated in the chemotherapy suite immediately 
prior to drug administration to avoid “white coat hypertension” that could be induced if measurements are taken in the chemotherapy administration suites immediately prior to drug administration.  For SBP > 1 60 or DBP > 100 delay 
administration and repeat blood pressure measurement no sooner than 30 minutes later.  If parameters remain elevated above these levels, bevacizumab will not be administered, and the responsible physician Investigator(s) will be notif ied. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to each dose, urine dipstick for protein must be obtained.  If ≥ 2+, a 24-hour 
urine for protein must be obtained prior to dose administration.

3.3 TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS  
During the induction period, if there is an indication to hold bevacizumab, liposomal doxorubicin may be continued.  If the bevacizumab is held for 1 week or less, the liposomal doxorubicin may be delayed until the bevacizumab is given.  If there is indication to hold bevacizumab for more than one week, liposomal doxorubicin may be continued as monotherapy. Bevacizumab will be resumed on subsequent cycles if criteria for administration of bevacizumab are met.   
If there is an indication to hold liposomal doxorubicin, both liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab will be held. Patients will be evaluated weekly until resolution of toxicities allow for continued administration of the combination of liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab. 
In the event of unforeseen circumstances ( e.g., travel difficulties) or Federal holidays, treatment 
may be rescheduled to the closest subsequent day possible, to a maximum of 1 week late, 
without constituting a protocol violation  
Indications for treatment modification for each agent are outlined.  
3.3.1 Bevacizumab  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Bevacizumab will not be administered unless SBP< 160 and DBP < 100.  Management of hypertension is outlined below. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Mild/Moderate Hypertension 
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
21 For SBP > 140 and < 210 mm Hg or DBP > 90 and < [ADDRESS_578311] be delayed until the blood SBP< 160 and DBP < 100.   
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Severe Hypertension 
For SBP ≥ 210 mm Hg or DBP ≥ [ADDRESS_578312] be delayed until blood SBP< 150 and DBP < 90.   
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Hypertensive Urgency or Emergency  
Bevacizumab therapy will be permanently discontinued in the presence of hypertensive urgency (DBP >120 with evidence of optic disc edema or progressive end- organ complications) or  hypertensive emergency (SBP > 210 
and DBP > 120 presenting with headaches, blurred vision, or focal neurological symptoms, or papi[INVESTIGATOR_044]).  Only grade 4 hypertension will require expedited reporting to the NCI- IRB.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombotic Events 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Deep Vein Thrombosis 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Bevacizumab will not be administered in the presence of deep vein thrombosis or in the presence of therapeutic anticoagulation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Arterial Thromboembolic Events 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_578313] due to coronary thrombosis and ischemic stroke. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia 
Bevacizumab and thromboprophylaxis (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg) will not be administered during the 
maintenance phase unless the platelets are ≥ 50,000 / µ L. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
Bevacizumab will be held if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is less than 750 cells/ µL until ANC is again above 750 cells/ µL.  Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim may be 
scheduled to individual patient requirement in order to maintain a neutrophil cou nt 
targeted to meet or exceed 750 cells/ µL.   
Subjects that develop neutropenic fever while receiving the combination of 
liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab will receive either filgrastim 5µg/kg 
(rounded to the nearest vial size of 300 µ g or 480 µ g) daily for 5 days or 
pegfilgrastim 6 mg once starting on day 2 of subsequent cycles that include 
liposomal doxorubicin.   
Subjects that develop neutropenic fever while on bevacizumab monotherapy will 
receive either filgrastim 5µg/kg (rounded to the nearest vial size of 300 µ g or 480 
µg) daily for 5 days or pegfilgrastim 6 mg once, starting on day 2 of subsequent 
cycles.  
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
22 [IP_ADDRESS] Hemorrhage 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Life Threatening  
In the case of hemoptysis, hematemesis, hematochezia, intracranial hemorrhage or any 
significant blood loss, bevaciz umab will not be administered.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Cutaneous KS  
In the case of cutaneous bleeding at tumor site(s), bevacizumab may be delayed.  If the bleeding is minor and appears to be due to tumor necrosis, bevacizumab may be administered without schedule or dose modification at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.  Bevacizumab will be held for grade 3 tumor bleeding. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Proteinuria  
If urine dipstick indicates ≥2+ proteinuria, bevacizumab administration will be 
delayed pending the results of a 24-hour urine collection for protein.  If the 24-hour urine protein is ≥2 grams, bevacizumab will be delayed for up to 6 weeks, until the proteinuria is <2+ or the 24-hour urine protein is < 1 grams/24 hr. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Liver Function Abnormalities 
Bevacizumab should be withheld in the event of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_578314] recovered to ≤ Grade 1 (with the exceptio n of hyperbilirubinemia attributable to protease inhibitor therapy, in which 
case the total bilirubin must recover to ≤ 7.5 mg/dL and the direct fraction ≤ 0.7 mg/dl.)  If LFT elevations recur with re -treatment, bevacizumab should be 
permanently discontinued.  Liver function tests included are the transaminases alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin.  Elevated bilirubin due to protease inhibitor therapy will not require treatment mod ification.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Allergic Reaction  
In case of flushing, shortness of breath, facial edema, headache, chills, back pain, tightness of the chest and throat, and/or hypotension, fever or rash, the infusion should be suspended until the patient is assessed until the events have subsided.  For grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions, bevacizumab will be permanently discontinued. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Surgical or periodontal procedures  
If there is need for an elective major surgical or periodontal procedure, bevacizumab should be held beginning at least [ADDRESS_578315] prior to bevacizumab resumption.  For KS skin biopsies and other minor procedures (i.e. interventional radiology 
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
23 diagnostic procedures), bevacizumab will be held only if ther e is evidence that 
healing is compromised.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) 
Bevacizumab should not be administered to patients with signs or symptoms of 
RPLS.  Evaluation should include neurologic evaluation, ocular examination, head MRI, and blood pressure assessment.  If these clinical criteria are consistent with the diagnosis of RPLS, bevacizumab will be permanently discontinued. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fistula Formation  
Bevacizumab will be discontinued in the event of formation of a fistula. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Gra de [ADDRESS_578316] possibly related to bevacizumab.  Lymphopenia and other toxicities clearly related to HIV or its therapy or to the Kaposi’s sarcoma itself will not req uire dose 
modification.  Grade 3 or higher asymptomatic hyperuricemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated creatinine phosphokinase levels will not result in dose delay. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Option of Deferring Bevacizumab Loading Dose 
If deferral of cytotoxic chemotherapy for one week is deemed to be unsafe by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_453444], the loading dose (Day 1) of bevacizumab may be omitted. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Option of Additional Bevacizumab 
For patients showing evidence of progressive improvement on bevacizumab after 
one year, therapy may be continued for up to an additional 12 months, for a maximum of up to 24 months of therapy from the date of enrollment on protocol.  In addition, patients who receive additional liposomal doxorubicin after the initial 6 cycles (see Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS].) may receive up to [ADDRESS_578317] dose of therapy (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Toxicity evaluation for patients receiving additional bevacizumab will follow the schedule outlined in Section 3.5.2. For patients receiving additional liposomal doxorubicin, repeat cardiac evaluation will occur 3 weeks (+/ - 1 week) after the final dose of liposomal doxorubicin as outlined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Patients will be followed on study for up to 2 years on study after their final dose of therapy (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].). 
3.3.2 Liposomal Doxorubicin

[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic Toxicities 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Neutropenia 
Liposomal doxorubicin will be held if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is 
less than 750 cells/ µL on Day 1 of a cycle until ANC is again above 750 
cells/ µL. Liposomal doxorubicin will not be administered within 14 days 
following pegfilgrastim administration.  
Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim may be scheduled to individual patient requ irement 
in order to maintain a neutrophil count targeted to meet or exceed 750 cells// µL.  
Patients that develop neutropenic fever will receive either filgrastim 5µg/kg (rounded to the nearest vial size of 300 µ g or 480 µ g) daily for 5 days or 
pegfilgrasti m 6 mg once, starting on day two of subsequent cycles that include 
liposomal doxorubicin. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Thrombocytopenia 
Liposomal doxorubicin will be held for up to 4 weeks if the platelet count is 
<75, 000 / µ L. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_453445] <50,000 / µ L. 
Liposomal doxorubicin dose will be reduced by 25% in subsequent cycles if the 
platelet count nadir is <25,000, or if there is > 1week delay due to thrombocytopenia or if dose delays due to thrombocytopenia occur in > 1 cycle.

Baseline whole body photographs will be obtained upon entry into the study.  At this time, 5 lesions (hereafter called marker lesions), representative of the patient’s 
disease and, if possible, located on separate areas of the body will be selected.  These 
marker lesions should be lesions that have never been treated with local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_453446].  Detailed photographs of these lesions will be obtained with a metric rule beside them.  The size, color and nodularity of these lesions will be recorded on Day 1 of each cycle.  Documentation will depend on the number of lesions. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1 50 or More Lesions 
For patients with 50 or more lesions at entry, between 1 and 3 representative areas will be selected at baseline and these will be used for each subsequent evaluation.  Representative areas are sections of the body (e.g. the back, a leg, an arm, etc.), which contain at least [ADDRESS_578321] made of whether they are flat or raised.  If, in the course of treatme nt, a single lesion breaks up into 2 or 
more smaller lesions (whose area does not extend beyond the boundary of the initial lesion), these lesions will still be counted as single lesions for the purpose of assessing total numbers in defining a response to therapy.  An attempt will be

ONCURRENT THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_5165]  
3.6.1 Anti-retroviral Therapy  
Patients will receive antiretroviral therapy if it is indicated.  Combination therapy will be generally based on Department of Health and Hu man Services Guidelines for treatment of HIV 
infection, available at http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/
.  However, patients may have 
extenuating circumstances requiring deviation from these guidelines.  Whenever possible, changing antiretroviral therapy should be avoided unless needed for optimal patient care.  Additionally, referring physicians may manage this component of patient care.   
3.6.2 Pneumocystis jiroveci Prophylaxis 
For HIV -infected patien ts with history of PCP or with CD4 cells ≤ 200/mm3 should receive 
Bactrim DS PO 3x/week.  Alternatives include but are not limited Bactrim DS PO daily, Dapsone 100 mg PO qd, and monthly aerosolized pentamidine. 
3.6.3 MAC Prophylaxis 
Consider for all HIV -infected  patients with a historic CD4 nadir less than 75 cells/mm
3, or for 
patients whose CD4 cells fall below this level while on study. Recommend azithromycin 1200 mg once weekly, but other agents are acceptable.  
3.6.4 Antihypertensive Therapy 
Blood pressure will be monitored at baseline and throughout follow-up.  Blood pressure diagnosis and management will follow the general principals of the Seventh Report of the Joint Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of high Blood pressure (JNC-7)
58.  All patients who are diagnosed with hypertension during screening or follow- up will 
be treated for hypertension.

5.[ADDRESS_578358] 20 lesions will be considered.  However, complete responses still require the absence of any  detectable disease 
over the entire body (i.e. not confined to the representative areas). 
5.2.1 Complete Respo nse 
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
38 [IP_ADDRESS] The absence of any detectable residual disease, including tumor- associated edema, 
persisting for at least 4 weeks.   
[IP_ADDRESS] In patients in whom pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194] m acular skin lesions persist after apparent CR, 
biopsy of at least one representative lesion is required to document the absence of 
malignant cells.   
[IP_ADDRESS] In patients known to have had visceral disease, an attempt at restaging with 
appropriate endoscopic or radiographic procedures should be made.  If such procedures are medically contraindicated, the patient may be classified as having a clinical CR.  
5.2.2 Clinical Complete Response 
[IP_ADDRESS] The absence of any detectable residual disease, including tumor associated edema, 
persisting for at least 4 weeks.   
[IP_ADDRESS] For patients with pi[INVESTIGATOR_453455], a representative lesion has not been biopsied.   
[IP_ADDRESS] For patients with visceral disease, the diagnostic radiologic or endoscopic study 
should be repeated if not medically contraindicated and found to be negative for evidence of disease. If such procedures are medically contraindicated but the patient has no clinical evidence of visceral disease, the patient may be classified as having a clinical CR.  
5.2.3 Partial Response  
No progressive disease (see below and noting, that single lesions which split up into 2 or more smaller lesions during the course of treatment will still be counted as one); no new lesions occurring in previously uninvolved areas of the body; no new visceral sites of involvement or the appearance or worsening of tumor- associated edema or effusions and:  
[IP_ADDRESS] A 50% or greater decrease in the number and/or size of previously existing lesions 
lasting for at least 4 weeks or 
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete flattening of at least 50% of all previously raised lesions (i.e., 50% of all 
previously nodular or plaque- like lesions become macular) lasting for at least 4 
weeks or  
[IP_ADDRESS] A 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters of 
the marker lesions lasting for at least 4 weeks or 
[IP_ADDRESS] A 50% decrease in radiologically measurable visceral lesions sustained without 
evidence of re -growth for at least 4 weeks or 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients who otherwise meet the criteria for a CR but still have residual tumor-
associated edema or effusions will be classified as having a PR.  
5.2.4 Progressive Disease  
[IP_ADDRESS] For those criteria that involve measurement of lesions in the clinic, the designation 
of progression should be made, when feasible, only when the criteria below have been met in two measurements spaced at least 1 week apart. For the assignment of 
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
39 progressive disease for the primary outcome analysis, progression will be defined in 
comparison to baseline measurements.  
[IP_ADDRESS] An increase of 25% or more over baseline in the number of lesions and/or the size 
(sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters) of the marker lesions or 
[IP_ADDRESS] A change in character from macular to plaque- like or nodular of at least 25% of the 
lesions or 
[IP_ADDRESS] New visceral sites of involvement or progression of viscer al disease or 
[IP_ADDRESS] The development of new or increasing tumor- associated edema or effusion that lasts 
at least 1 week and interferes with the patient’s normal activities.  
5.2.5 Stable Disease 
Any tumor measurement not meeting the criteria for Complete Response, Parti al Response, or 
Progressive Disease.  
5.2.6 Overall Response  
Overall  Response = Complete Response + Clinical Complete Response + Partial Response.  The Overall Response Rate (ORR) is the fraction of subjects with an Overall Response after 6 cycles of liposomal doxorubicin in combination with bevacizumab. 
5.2.7 Progression- free survival  
As Kaposi’s Sarcoma is a disease in which recurrence is common, progression will be determined based on progression from best response.  As in section 5.2.4., progression must be docume nted on two visits at least [ADDRESS_578359] response 
include: 
[IP_ADDRESS] An increase of 25% or more over best response in the number of lesions and/or the 
size (sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters) of the marker lesions or 
[IP_ADDRESS] A change in character from macular to plaque- like or nodular of at least 25% of the 
lesions or 
[IP_ADDRESS] New visceral sites of involvement or progression of visceral disease or 
[IP_ADDRESS] The development of new or increasing tumor- associated edema or effusion that lasts 
at least [ADDRESS_578360] response.

5.4 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
5.4.1 Racial/gender make-up 
Subjects from both genders and all ra cial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if 
they meet the eligibility criteria outlined in section 2.1.  Outreach efforts will be made to extend accrual to a representative population. As a practical matter, it should be noted that historically in the US, KS has been relatively rare in females with HIV infection.  However, our more recent studies have increasingly accrued female immigrants from Africa.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_578361] assent.   
5.4.3 Sample size and accrual limit  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Outcome  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The primary objective is to estimate of the overall response 
rate of the combination of liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab after 6 cycles in patients with advanced Kaposi’s sarcoma. The ORR will be evaluated in two cohorts of patients.  
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
41 Cohort 1:  Patients who are either:  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 HIV negative  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 HIV inf ected with stable KS despi[INVESTIGATOR_453457] 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 HIV infected with progressive KS despi[INVESTIGATOR_453458] 2:  All other patients with advanced AIDS -associated KS  
Ten evaluable patients will be enrolled in each cohort (20 total).  Patients are 
considered evaluable if they (1) have received at least 2 cycles of liposomal doxorubicin, OR (2) have come off the protocol for reasons of treatment toxicity.  Up to 3 patients in each cohort may be replaced if they come off the study before being considered evaluable.  Thus, the accrual ceiling will be 26 patients.  With 10 evaluable patients in each cohort, the 80% two sided confidence intervals about the fraction with any responses are as follows:  
Number of responses      80% CI 
1.                             .01-.34 
2.                             .05-.45 3.                             .12-.55 4.                            .19-.65 5.                             .27-.73 6.                             .35-.81 7.                             .45-.88 8.                             .55-.95 9.                             .66-.99 Thus, the evaluation of 10 patients in each cohort may allow an estimate with an 80% 
CI width of approximately .33 to .45. The estimates in the two cohorts will be 
compared and if they are similar (p>0.30 by a Fisher’s exact test), they may be combined to form a somewhat more precise estimate of the fraction that respond within 6 cycles of treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Outcomes  
The following secondary outcomes will be evaluated with the following statistical considerations.

Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018   
42 Toxicities (including those possibly, probably, and definitely attributed to study 
treatment) will be assessed by [CONTACT_479].  Toxicities will be evaluated both per cycle and per patient.    All patients will be considered evaluable for toxicity.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Estimate the complete response rate after 6 cycles of the combination of liposomal doxorub icin in combination with bevacizumab in evaluable 
patients with advanced KS.  
The evaluable patients from each cohort will be evaluated separately as described in section [IP_ADDRESS].  The 80% confidence intervals of the estimates of complete response rates and  the corresponding to the number of response are 
listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The estimates in the two cohorts will be compared and if they are similar 
(p>0.30 by a Fisher’s exact test), they may be combined to form a somewhat more precise estimate of the fr action that have a complete response within 6 
cycles of treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Estimate the median number of cycles of liposomal doxorubicin in combination with bevacizumab required to achieve a partial response in patients with advanced KS.  
The median number of cycle s required to achieve a partial response will be 
described for evaluable patients in each cohort separately, along with a range of number of cycles required. Patients with progressive disease will be excluded from this analysis.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_578362] similar PFS (which will be indicated by [CONTACT_7661] a p-value >0.[ADDRESS_578363]). Since 
the number of patients will be sma ll, these results will be considered to provide 
approximate estimates of PFS. The two -sided 80% confidence interval around 
the PFS estimate at one year will be computed, and it will be of interest to determine if this interval includes 70%, the result that was found in our previous Doxil/IL -[ADDRESS_578364] to PFS in an informal manner.

ISK/BENEFITS ANALYSIS  
The risks to individual study subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits.  This 
protocol combines a standard FDA approved agent for the treatment of KS with bevacizumab, which has strong preclinical rationale, an acceptable toxicity profile and promising clinical activity in our previous phase II study, 03-C-0110.  Potential therapeutic benefits include limitation of cumulative anthracyclin e dosing, more rapid tumor regression, and additional 
therapeutic options for patients for difficult to manage KS. The risks include potential additive toxicities and additional studies associated with participation in a clinical study.  The major alternat ive for patients with advanced KS is to receive FDA approved agents outside of a clinical 
study.  The comparative risks and benefits are acceptable for an early phase clinical study, when compared to the alternatives for patients with advanced KS.

guidelines describe how these principles apply to this specific protocol.   
6.5.1 AIDS Monitoring Laboratory 
Many samples on this study will be processed and stored in the AIDS Monitoring Laboratory (AML) run b y Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in the NCI- Frederick 
facility located with Fort Detrick.  The samples are stored under code, and the information linking these unique codes to the patients is kept on the AML database.  The laboratory informatics system conforms to NIH Information Technology Security Requirements and NIH Protection of Human Research Subjects Guidelines.  All laboratory staff is trained to adhere to NIH Information Technology Security Requirements and NIH Protection of Human Research Subjects Guidelines.  Computers used to access inventory systems require username [CONTACT_453493]. The laboratory database is housed in a secure, protected environment and backups are performed routinely.  Access to specimen information, clinical data, and stored specimens is limited to approved laboratory staff and the investigator in charge of the study (or individuals authorized by [CONTACT_093]). Clinical testing of all samples will be one in accordance to the protocol.  The protocol team will inform the AML staff when tests are to be run with the specimens, and the samples used for testing will be tracked by [CONTACT_453476].  This information will in turn be shared with the protocol team.  The research nurse on the study will be in charge of tracking this information for the protocol team.

7.1.2 Suspected adverse reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
7.1.3 Unexpected adverse reaction  
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not li sted in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational pla n or elsewhere in the current application. 
"Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties o f the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation. 
7.1.4 Serious  
An Unanticipated P roblem  or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the defini tion of a Serious 
Adverse Event or if it compromises the safe ty, welfare or rights of subjects or others. 
7.1.5 Serious Adverse Event  
An adver se event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following: 
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Important medical event s that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgica l intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

51 8.1.3 Toxicity  
A summary of previously reported adverse events is listed below. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion related events  
Flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, rash, fever, chills. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiovascular 
Pericardial effusion , hypertension (including hypertensive crisis), hypotension, and 
decrease in cardiac function.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic  
Arterial and venous thrombosis/embolism (including pulmonary embolism, 
mesenteric vein thrombosis, ischemic bowel, cerebral vascular accident); hemorrhage (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], CNS hemorrhage/bleeding, hematemesis, hemoptysis, GI bleeding, pulmonary hemorrhage); hemorrhage/bleeding without grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, leukopenia. Thrombosis and hemorrhage could be life threatening and fatal.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Constitutional  
Fever, rigors, chills, headache,  infection without neutropenia, asthenia. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin/integument   
Rash/desquamation; delay in wound healing.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal  
Nausea, colitis, stomatitis/pharyngitis, intestinal obstruction,  vomit ing.  Rare 
adverse events include bowel peroration, bowel anastomotic dehiscence and the possibility of delay in wound healing.  These events have been reported in clinical trials using bevacizumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy, and were likely  related to co -existing factors such as tumor involvement, chemotherapy, 
recent invasive procedures or bowel inflammation.  However, it cannot be excluded that bevacizumab contributed to these events.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic (rare)  
Reversible and marked elevations of li ver function tests (total bilirubin and /or 
transaminase and alkaline phosphatase) have been rarely reported when bevacizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy or concurrently with other drugs that are potentially hepatotoxic.  The mechanism of such hepatic toxicities is unclear.  It is possible that in rare occasion, bevacizumab may potentiate the liver side effects of a concurrent medication, although it is unclear at this time whether bevacizumab alone can cause LFT derangement.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pulmonary  
Pulmonary infiltration, dyspnea  
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal/Genitourinary  
Proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome   
Abbreviated Title: Doxil/Bevacizumab in KS  
Version Date : 01/16/2018

Arthralgia, chest pain  
[IP_ADDRESS] Central Nervous System  
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) or similar 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome related to vasoge nic edema of the white matter 
have been rarely reported in associated with bevacizumab therapy (<1%).  Clinical presentations are variable and may include altered mental status, seizure and cortical visual deficit.  HTN is a common risk factor and was present in most (though not all) patients on bevacizumab who developed RPLS.  MRI scans are key to diagnosis and typi[INVESTIGATOR_453461] (hyperintensity in T2 and FLAIR images and hypointensity in T1 images) predominantly in the white matter of the posterior parietal and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_33934]; less frequently, the anterior 
distributions and the gray matter may also be involved.  RPLS should be in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with unexplained mental status change, visual disturbance,  seizure or other CNS findings.  RPLS  is potentially reversible, 
but timely correction of the underlying causes, including control of blood pressure and interruption of the offending drug, is important in order to prevent progression to irreversible tissu e damage.  
8.1.4 Formulation and Preparation 
[IP_ADDRESS] How supplied:  Bevacizumab is supplied as a clear to slightly opalescent, sterile 
liquid ready for parenteral administration in vials of two sizes:  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Each 100mg (25 mg/mL – 4 mL fill) glass vial contains bevacizumab with phosphate, trehalose, polysorbate 20, and Sterile Water for Injection, USP or 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Each 1000 mg (25 mg/ml- 40 ml fill) glass vial contains bevacizumab with phosphate, trehalose, polysorbate 20, and Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation:   Opened vials must be used within 8 hours.  Vials contain no 
preservative and are intended for single use only.  The calculated dose should be placed in a sterile, empty IV bag and diluted with a sufficient amount of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to obtain a final volume of 100 mL.  Once the bevacizumab has been added to the bag with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, the solution must be administered within [ADDRESS_578384] container is empty, 0.9% NS from the primary line should be used to flush the secondary set to complete rhuMAb VEGF delivery.  0.9% NS infusion should be continued to flush the primary IV set with a volume of fluid at least equal to the tubing priming volume, thus insuring complete drug delivery. Note that this flush is 
not included in the infusion times below." 
8.1.5 Stability and Storage  
Bevacizumab is shipped on blue ice by [CONTACT_453482].  On receipt, bevacizumab 
should be stored in the refrigerator (2° to 8° C) and should remain refrigerated until 
just prior to use.  Do not fr eeze.  Do not shake.   Shelf -life studies of bevacizumab are 
continuing.   Opened vials must be used within 8 hours.  Vials contain no preservative

 LIPOSOMAL DOXORUBICIN  
8.2.1 Commercially available  
[IP_ADDRESS] FDA indication for use in AIDS- associated KS  
[IP_ADDRESS] Manufacturer: Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. (Doxil) or Sun Pharmaceutical 
Industries, Ltd. (Lipodox).  Lipodox may be used in place of Doxil if Doxil is not 
available.  
8.2.2 Supplier 
Clinical Center Pharmacy will obtain liposomal doxorubicin from commercial sources.  
8.2.3 Toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic effects  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Neutropenia is the predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less frequently . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac Effects  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Conduction Disorders  
Acute transient abnormal ECG findings (ST-T wave changes, prolongation of QT interval, arrhythmias) 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Cardiomyopathy 
Subacute chronic cardiotoxicity, resulting in cardiomyopathy, usually occurs within 1 year after discontinuance of anthracycline treatment, but experience with liposomal doxorubicin at high cumulative doses currently is too limited to establish its cardiotoxic potential.  Late onset cardiotoxicity occurs with high cumulative doses of anthracycline therapy, mainly in those who received the drugs as children.  The potential for this complication in the liposomal preparation is not known. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal effects  
Stomatitis, esophagitis (mucositis)

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Alopecia (less with liposomal preparation than with the conventional 
formulation)  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Radiation recall injury  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion- related Reactions 
Flushing, shortness of breath, facial edema, headache, chills, back pain, chest and throat tightness, hypotension. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Local Effects 
Extravasation produces local tissue necrosis, cellulitis, vesication, thrombophlebitis, 
lymphangitis or painful induration. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
Liposomal doxorubicin can cause fetal harm.  
8.2.4 Formulation and Preparation

10.3 APPENDIX  3: DESCRIPTION OF NON-INVASIVE IMAGING DEVICES  
1. Laser Doppler Imaging Device 
A Moor Instrument moorLDI-2l- simultaneous two wavelength scan will be used.  The scan 
images at 685 -690 and 780 nm. This imager scans a low power laser beam (5mW, 800 micron 
diameter) in a raster pattern over the skin.  There is no contact [CONTACT_8124].  The scanner is 
produced by [CONTACT_453487]., [ADDRESS_578392]., Suite 66, Wilmington, DE [ZIP_CODE].  The scanner is held on a special stand (Moor MS2 stand) made specifically for such devices.  
A very closely related instrument, the moor LDI -VR scanner is approved by [CONTACT_453488].  This scanner just utilizes one wavelength of light (633 nm). The device that will be used in the present study differs from the FDA- approved device in that it also assesses the lesions using 
a second wavelength and that the first wavelength is slightly longer.  The other potential safety issue is that the 780 nm wavelength is in the infrared spectrum and would not visible. Thus patients and users would not necessarily blink if it shined into their eyes.  However, both lights shine on the same spot so patients or users would blink upon seeing the 685 nm wavelength (which is visible).  Also, the machine is constructed to minimize the chance of anyone (patient or user) looking into the laser light.  
2. Multispectral Imaging  
For multispectral imaging, a charge coupled device (CCD) handheld camera will be used.  This uses CCD technology similar to that utilized in most digital cameras.  The lesions will be illuminated uniformly by a white light held approximately 30 cm from the patient’s skin.  Using optical filters, those wavelengths associated w ith oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin 
absorption spectra will be selected and CCD images will be made.  The camera is a cooled Princeton CCD Camera interfaced by [CONTACT_453489] a personal computer with associated data analysis software.  The camera is low volt age.  The camera will not directly contact [CONTACT_453490] 5 cm or more from the patient’s skin (approximately 30 to 50). 
3. Thermal Imaging 
For thermal imaging, infrared -sensitive handheld cameras will be used.  We plan to use a camera 
modified from the BioEar PRISM 2000 Thermal Metabolic Imaging System ([ADDRESS_578393]., Houston, TX).  The name [CONTACT_453494]™ Alert, FLIR Systems, [LOCATION_003]. This camera is at ambient temperature.  If it becomes available, we will also test a cooled  camera 
modified from the ThermaCAM SC3000 (FLIR Systems, [ADDRESS_578394]., [LOCATION_011], MA).  Cooling has the potential of giving more accurate measurements with less background noise.  If this camera is found to be superior and can be made available on a long-t erm basis, we will switch 
over to its use.  
These cameras use low voltage electricity (12 - 13 volts) provided by [CONTACT_453491].  They do 
not touch the patient and will be held more than 5 cm from the patient’s skin (approximately 50 cm).

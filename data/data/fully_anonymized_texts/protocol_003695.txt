_____________________________________________________________________________________________  15Apri2016 CTTI 001 V 2.1 (Amendment 1)                                                   9  1.0 Background and Scientific Rationale  1.1 Background Information  Clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new antibacterial drugs for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) are challenging to conduct and expensive, and there are a very limited number of clinical trials of new drugs for this indication in progress or planned.  Evaluating new antibacterial drugs for efficacy in HABP/VABP is important, as a number of antibacterial drugs with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of other serious bacterial infections have demonstrated limitations when studied in HABP/VABP.  In addition, patients with infections caused by [CONTACT_7163]-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria often present with HABP/VABP.1  The Clinical Trial Transformation Initiative (CTTI) is a collaborative organization that seeks to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical trials. The CTTI Streamlining HABP/VABP Trials Project includes a number of collaborative efforts to better understand the challenges of conducting HABP/VABP trials and address these challenges through streamlining the operational processes and building efficiencies for data collection in HABP/VABP trials.[ADDRESS_730824] for a Phase 3 HABP/VABP trial.3 HABP/VABP Phase [ADDRESS_730825] received effective antibacterial drug therapy for HABP/VABP for a continuous duration of more than 24 hours during the previous 72 hours be excluded from HABP/VABP clinical trials.  In a guided discussion with experienced research coordinators conducted by [CONTACT_556408], this recommended exclusion criteria was noted as a significant challenge to enrollment as care standards in the intensive care unit often lead to antibacterial drugs being administered as soon as pneumonia is suspected.  In addition, patients are often quite ill and unable to provide informed consent themselves, so legally authorized representatives must be identified and contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Other necessary enrollment procedures such as laboratory tests and other procedures to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomization, and obtaining study drug from the pharmacy can add to the time between administration of antibacterial drugs and study enrollment.  Strategies to address these feasibility concerns while ensuring that trial interpretability will not be limited by a bias toward non-inferiority are needed. A HABP/VABP pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], incorporating many of the recommendations from the CTTI Streamlining HABP/VABP Trials Project, is planned. The primary objective is to conduct a study that will lead to improved HABP/VABP clinical trial feasibility. The proposed design of the future pi[INVESTIGATOR_9962] a randomized trial comparing early enrollment and traditional enrollment strategies. The early enrollment strategy (treatment arm) will include approaching AND consenting patients at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_127355], many before pneumonia symptoms develop. The rationale of this early enrollment strategy is to identify and enroll high-risk patients at the time they meet criteria for a diagnosis of HABP/VABP and before they have received more than 24 hours of effective antibacterial therapy. 1.2 Scientific Rationale  One of the challenges in planning the HABP/VABP pi[INVESTIGATOR_556369]. A group of patients at risk for pneumonia is required, but selecting criteria based on existing literature will involve a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. Approaching only the highest risk patients (e.g., those on a ventilator for a pre-specified length of time) would likely yield a relatively high percentage of patients who go on to develop pneumonia.5 The drawbacks of this approach include 1) not including a mix of VABP and non-VABP HABP; 2) exclusion of a large group of other patients who go on to develop

_____________________________________________________________________________________________  15Apri2016 CTTI 001 V 2.1 (Amendment 1) [ADDRESS_730826] risk factors; and 3) increased likelihood of exclusion due to current use of antibiotics. Using a more inclusive approach, such as enrolling patients with a history of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_556370], would increase the total number of patients who ultimately develop pneumonia, but would decrease the proportion of enrolled patients that develop pneumonia. If the proportion of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_556371], it is possible that the time, effort, and money required to conduct a study using an early enrollment strategy would not result in a meaningful increase in number of patients enrolled who ultimately meet study criteria for antibacterial therapy for HABP/VABP. Therefore, this risk factor study will be conducted to better define the population at highest risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_556372]/VABP. 2.0 Hypotheses 2.1 Primary Hypothesis • At least 5% of patients considered high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_556373]/VABP during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay. High-risk patients are those admitted to an ICU who are treated with one or more of the following respi[INVESTIGATOR_556368] 12 hours (Arm 1) or 24 hours (Arm 2), either currently or within the prior 7 days: invasive mechanical ventilation; noninvasive mechanical ventilation for any indication other than obstructive sleep apnea; or supplemental oxygen therapy with a partial or non-rebreather mask, high-flow nasal cannula (a system that uses an air/oxygen blender and delivers a precise fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] [FiO2] level, not just a flow in liters per minute [LPM]), or high flow supplemental oxygen therapy delivering at least 50% FiO2 via aerosol facemask or tracheostomy collar (mask).  • At least 75% of patients diagnosed with HABP/VABP during an ICU admission would meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the FDA draft guidance document for HABP/VABP drug development for a clinical trial of antibacterial therapy for HABP/VABP.  3.0 Objectives 3.1 Primary Objectives (Arm 1: age ≥18 years old): a. Estimate the rates of HABP/VABP diagnosis in ICU patients considered high risk for pneumonia. High risk is defined by [CONTACT_556407][INVESTIGATOR_556368] 12 hours, currently or within the prior 7 days: i. Invasive mechanical ventilation  ii. Noninvasive ventilation (bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP] or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] for any indication other than obstructive sleep apnea) iii. High-flow, supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. Only include systems using an air/oxygen blender capable of delivering a precise FiO2 level, not just a flow in LPM. iv. High flow supplemental oxygen therapy delivering at least 50% FiO2 via aerosol facemask or tracheostomy collar (mask). Only include systems using an air/oxygen blender capable of delivering a precise FiO2 level, not just a flow in LPM. v.

Patients <[ADDRESS_730833] 5 days. Patients not meeting high-risk criteria, “other-ICU patients”, will be screened twice weekly for antibiotic treatment for suspected pneumonia.  Once a high-risk subject or other-ICU patient is treated with antibiotics for either a lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (LRTI) or undifferentiated sepsis, additional clinical information will be recorded from the subject’s medical record. All subjects treated with antibiotics for either indication will subsequently be screened for the development of pneumonia, as defined by [CONTACT_556409]/VABP. Subjects who meet the FDA draft guidance definition of pneumonia will have vitals and physiologic data collected and will be followed for [ADDRESS_730834]’s electronic health record and recorded in a secure electronic case report form. No information on outcomes, such as vital status, discharge destination, or length of stay will be collected. The data collected in this risk factor study will be used to better define the ICU population at highest risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_556372]/VABP.  4.1 Inclusion Criteria (Arm 1: age ≥18 years old) • Admission to participating ICU • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] >48 hours or admitted <7 days after discharge from an inpatient acute or chronic care facility  Please see Appendix B for Arm 2 (age <18 years old) information  4.1.1 High-Risk Inclusion (Arm 1) Treated with one or more of the following respi[INVESTIGATOR_556368] 12 hours, either currently or within the prior 7 days:  • Invasive mechanical ventilation • Noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP or CPAP for any indication other than obstructive sleep apnea) • High-flow, supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.

In addition, data will be collected on subjects not meeting high-risk criteria but who are treated with antibiotics for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis for which HABP/VABP is considered in the differential diagnosis. • Arm 1: approximately 6850 patients ≥18 years old • Arm 2: approximately 1000 patients < 18 years old Sections 5.2 through 5.5 below apply to Arm 1. Please see Appendix B for Arm 2 information 5.2 Enrollment (Arm 1) All patients admitted to a study site ICU who have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192608] 48 hours or discharged from an inpatient acute or chronic care facility within the prior 7 days will be screened for study inclusion. If any exclusion criterion is present, the patient will be recorded as a “screening failure” in the screening log and no further data will be collected. If the patient satisfies the study enrollment criteria, he/she will be enrolled in the study. The subject will be counted as an inclusion in the screening log, and he/she will also be registered in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. For each enrolled subject, the types of respi[INVESTIGATOR_556382] [ADDRESS_730836] 12 hours will be followed per the “High-Risk” protocol. All other ICU patients, meeting eligibility criteria in 4.1, but not receiving respi[INVESTIGATOR_556383] 4.1.1 or receiving for less than 12 hours will be followed according to the “Other-ICU” protocol. Other-ICU patients are enrolled only if they receive antibiotic therapy for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________  15Apri2016 CTTI 001 V 2.1 (Amendment 1) 15 5.3 High-Risk Protocol (Arm 1) Demographic, admission, and medical problems will be recorded for subjects meeting criteria for “high-risk” on the day of enrollment. High-risk subjects will be followed daily for the initiation of antibiotic therapy for either the treatment of LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis for which HABP/VABP is considered in the differential diagnosis. Antibiotics prescribed and evaluation for the study definition of pneumonia will be completed for subjects treated with antibiotics for either of these indications. If the study criteria for HABP/VABP are present, treatment exposures and microbiology will then be completed, and the subject will be followed for an additional 4 days as described in Section 5.5. Subjects treated with antibiotics for either LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis but not meeting criteria for HABP/VABP will be reevaluated daily for the fulfillment of HABP/VABP study criteria. If antibiotics for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis are discontinued, screening per the High-Risk protocol will resume. Subjects who have not met the study criteria for HABP/VABP will be followed daily per the High-Risk protocol until they have not received support from at least one respi[INVESTIGATOR_556384]-risk criteria within the past [ADDRESS_730837] remains in the ICU beyond this time period, they will then be followed per the Other-ICU protocol until discharged from the ICU or transitioned to comfort measures and are no longer being treated with antibiotics. If support with a respi[INVESTIGATOR_556385] “high-risk” criteria is later required, the subject will then be followed per the High-Risk protocol again. 5.4 Other-ICU Protocol (Arm 1) Patients not meeting the “high-risk” criteria will be screened at least twice weekly for treatment with an antibiotic for either LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis for which HABP/VABP is considered in the differential diagnosis. Demographic, admission, medical problems, and antibiotics prescribed will be completed for subjects treated with antibiotics for either of these indications. Evaluation of the study definition of pneumonia will occur. If the study criteria for HABP/VABP are present, treatment exposures and microbiology will then be completed, and the subject will be followed for an additional 4 days as described in Section 5.5. Subjects treated with antibiotics for either LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis but not meeting criteria for HABP/VABP will be reevaluated daily for the fulfillment of HABP/VABP study criteria until antibiotics for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis are discontinued. For those other-ICU patients who never receive antibiotic treatment for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis during their ICU stay, no information will be collected. Subjects who have not met the study criteria for HABP/VABP will be followed per the Other-ICU protocol until discharged from the ICU or transitioned to comfort measures and are no longer being treated with antibiotics. Subjects originally assigned to the Other-ICU protocol who later require support with a respi[INVESTIGATOR_556386] 4.1.1. for at least 12 hours will be subsequently followed per the High-Risk protocol.  5.5 Study Completion (Arm 1) Subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_556372]/VABP will be followed for 4 days beyond the initial fulfillment of HABP/VABP study criteria to collect microbiologic and antibacterial treatment data. After 4 days, the patient will no longer be followed in the risk factor study.  Subjects who do not develop HABP/VABP will be followed until discharge from the ICU. Or, follow-up will end if the subject is transitioned to comfort measures and are no longer being treated with antibiotics. At the end of follow up, treatment exposures will be collected using the most abnormal values/events from the ICU stay.  6.0 Statistical Analysis Plan (Arm 1) Please see Arm 2 (< 18 years old) information in Appendix B.

All analyses will be performed in SAS 9.2 or higher.  6.2 Endpoints The primary endpoint is the development of FDA-defined HABP/VABP.  6.3 Sample Size  Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no power calculations are performed.  A sample size of 6850 high-risk patents was chosen based on an estimate of the number of patients that can feasibly be enrolled at 45 sites over 12 months, and it is believed that this number will provide a meaningful number of patients who develop HABP/VABP. This number assumes enrollment of one new high-risk patient per business day per site and the months of participation per site will range from 3-[ADDRESS_730839] 95% confidence intervals for the rate of HABP/VABP development (see Table 1 above). If the estimated rate of HABP/VABP is 5%, then the margin of error will be less than 1%.

The study does not involve direct interaction with human subjects. The medical records of patients admitted to the ICU will be screened and data collected from those records according this protocol. The patients will not be approached to obtain information, no intervention is being tested, and no samples or specimens are being collected. Therefore, the study should be considered no more than minimal risk, and the waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the patients observed.  This research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver of consent since the most critically ill patients, like the ICU patients, are very problematic to consent. This risk factor study requires screening of the medical records of all ICU patients, and data collection on a large

Study Discontinuation This study may be terminated at any time by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_556381]/or the FDA. 6. Study Procedures 6.1. Recruitment Plan This study will collect data on pediatric subjects who meet protocol-specified high-risk criteria. In addition, data will be collected on subjects not meeting high-risk criteria but who are treated with antibiotics for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis for which HABP/VABP is considered in the differential diagnosis. Approximately [ADDRESS_730847] 48 hours or discharged from an inpatient acute or chronic care facility within the prior 7 days will be screened for study inclusion. If any exclusion criterion is present, the patient will be recorded as a “screening failure” in the screening log and no further data will be collected. If the patient satisfies the study enrollment criteria, he/she will be enrolled in the study. The subject will be counted as an inclusion in the screening log, and he/she will also be registered in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. For each enrolled subject, the types of respi[INVESTIGATOR_556382] [ADDRESS_730848] 24 hours will be followed per the “High-Risk” protocol. All other patients, meeting eligibility criteria in Appendix B Section 2, but not receiving respi[INVESTIGATOR_556398] B Section 2.1 or receiving for less than 24 hours will be followed according to the “Standard-risk ” protocol. Standard-risk patients are enrolled only if they receive antibiotic therapy for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis. 6.3. High-Risk Protocol Demographic, admission, and medical problems will be recorded for subjects meeting criteria for “high-risk” on the day of enrollment.

Antibiotics prescribed and evaluation for the study definition of pneumonia will be completed for subjects treated with antibiotics for either of these indications. If the study criteria for HABP/VABP are present, treatment exposures and microbiology will then be completed, and the subject will be followed for an additional 4 days as described in Appendix B Section 6.5. Subjects treated with antibiotics for either LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis but not meeting criteria for HABP/VABP will be reevaluated daily for the fulfillment of HABP/VABP study criteria. If antibiotics for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis are discontinued, screening per the High-Risk protocol will resume. Subjects who have not met the study criteria for HABP/VABP will be followed daily per the High-Risk protocol until they have not received support from at least one respi[INVESTIGATOR_556384]-risk criteria within the past [ADDRESS_730849]-risk  protocol until discharged from the ICU or intermediate care unit or transitioned to comfort measures and are no longer being treated with antibiotics. If support with a respi[INVESTIGATOR_556385] “high-risk” criteria is later required, the subject will then be followed per the High-Risk protocol again.

Subjects treated with antibiotics for either LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis but not meeting criteria for HABP/VABP will be reevaluated daily for the fulfillment of HABP/VABP study criteria until antibiotics for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis are discontinued. For those  standard-risk patients who never receive antibiotic treatment for LRTI or undifferentiated sepsis during their ICU or intermediate care unit stay, no information will be collected. Subjects who have not met the study criteria for HABP/VABP will be followed per the  standard-risk protocol until discharged from the ICU or intermediate care unit or transitioned to comfort measures and are no longer being treated with antibiotics. Subjects originally assigned to the standard-risk protocol who later require support with a respi[INVESTIGATOR_556399] B Section 2.[ADDRESS_730851] 24 hours if ≥[ADDRESS_730852] 5 days if <120 days old will be subsequently followed per the High-Risk protocol.  6.5. Study Completion Subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_556372]/VABP will be followed for 4 days beyond the initial fulfillment of HABP/VABP study criteria to collect microbiologic and antibacterial treatment data. After 4 days, the patient will no longer be followed in the risk factor study.  Subjects who do not develop HABP/VABP will be followed until discharge from the ICU or intermediate care unit. Or, follow-up will end if the subject is transitioned to comfort measures and are no longer being treated with antibiotics. At the end of follow up, treatment exposures will be collected using the most abnormal values/events from the ICU or intermediate care unit stay.

General Considerations All continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of observations, number of missing observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum. All categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  No missing data imputation will be performed. All statistical tests will be two-sided and interpreted at the 5% level of significance without correction for multiple comparisons. All analyses will be performed in SAS 9.2 or higher.  7.2. Endpoints The primary endpoint is the development of FDA-defined HABP/VABP. HABP/VABP is defined as all below criteria are met: a. Chest radiograph showing the presence of new or progressive infiltrate(s) suggestive of bacterial pneumonia within 48 hours of all other diagnostic criteria being present b.

Timing: Signs/symptoms of pneumonia first noted >48 hours after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556400]/symptoms of pneumonia first noted >48 hours after initiation of mechanical ventilation  7.3. Sample Size Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no power calculations are performed.  A sample size of 1000 - pediatric patents was chosen based on an estimate of the number of patients that can feasibly be enrolled at 10 sites over 12 months, and it is believed that this number will provide a meaningful number of patients who develop HABP/VABP.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________  30 15Apri2016 CTTI 001 V 2.1 (Amendment 1) • Estimate the rate of HABP/VABP antibacterial discontinuation within [ADDRESS_730854] culture.  • Estimate the rate at which HABP/VABP antibacterials are changed within [ADDRESS_730855] culture results to narrow the antibacterial spectrum.  • Estimate the rate at which HABP/VABP antibacterials are changed within [ADDRESS_730856] culture results to broaden the antibacterial spectrum.  The following summaries will be conducted for subjects in the HABP/VABP population who have positive lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_19170]: • Summarize the bacterial pathogens of HABP/VABP. • Summarize the types of antibacterial resistance by [CONTACT_209058].  • Estimate the proportion of study sites in which MRSA was identified on ≥[ADDRESS_730857] culture. • Estimate the proportion of study sites in which an ESBL-producing Gram negative bacillus was identified on ≥[ADDRESS_730858] culture. • Estimate the proportion of study sites in which an carbapenemase-producing Gram negative bacillus was identified on ≥[ADDRESS_730859] 95% confidence intervals. All summaries will be presented as frequency counts and percentages. 7.5. Baseline Summaries The high-risk population will be summarized according to the following factors measured at the time of high-risk determination: • Invasive mechanical ventilation • Noninvasive ventilation • High-flow, supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. • High flow supplemental oxygen therapy delivering at least 50% FiO2 via aerosol facemask or tracheostomy collar (mask)   • Supplemental oxygen therapy delivered via either partial or non-rebreather face mask • Demographics: age, sex, height (cm), weight (kg), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556401], admission source, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556388] (calendar days), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556388], identification of legally authorized representative or medical proxy • Medical problems: reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556393], aspi[INVESTIGATOR_50498], medical history, and drug allergies • Treatment exposures: type and duration of ventilation, enteral nutrition, medications, and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_556403]_PTN Risk Factors for HABP/VABP Study     
_____________________________________________________________________________________________  31 15Apri2016 CTTI 001 V 2.1 (Amendment 1) 7.6. Interim Analysis One interim analysis will be conducted during the study. The primary purpose of the interim analysis is to assess futility by [CONTACT_556416] (1.1a-b, 1.2a, and 1.2b). The interim analysis will occur after [ADDRESS_730860].  The following analyses will be conducted on the high-risk population: a. Estimate the rate of HABP/VABP development as well as its exact 95% confidence interval. If the exact 95% confidence interval for the pneumonia rate in high-risk subjects does not include 5%, the feasibility of continuing the risk factor study and/or an amendment to expand the high-risk definition will be discussed.   b. Assess the risk factors, comorbid medical illnesses, and treatment exposures associated with the development of HABP/VABP in subjects at high-risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_556387] a logistic regression model with age, sex, height (cm), weight (kg), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556401], admission source, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556388] (calendar days), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556388], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556402], aspi[INVESTIGATOR_50498], medical history, type and duration of ventilation, enteral nutrition, medications, and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_556389].  The following analysis will be conducted on the HABP/VABP population: estimate the proportion of subjects, as well as its exact 95% confidence interval, who would be eligible for enrollment in a clinical trial of antibacterial therapy for HABP/VABP per FDA guidance document criteria.  The following analysis will be conducted on the treated population: estimate the proportion of subjects, as well as its exact 95% confidence interval, who would be eligible for enrollment in a clinical trial of antibacterial therapy for HABP/VABP per FDA guidance document criteria.

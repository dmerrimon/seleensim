assessed for study eligibility. Rescreening of subjects is allowable under 
certain circumstances with the approval of the Sponsor and Medical Monitor.  
 
During the Screening/Baseline period data will also be collected to establish 
the subject’s baseline characteristics and symptom severity based on 
assessments collected during the 4 to 6 week period. There are two in-clinic 
visits and one remote/in-home visit during the Screening and Baseline period 
(Visits 1, 2, 3).  
 
Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be dosed at a starting dose of 4 
mg/kg twice daily (BID) and up-titrated to a target dose of 12 mg/kg BID of 
orally administered NNZ-2591.  The mg/kg dosing is based on the subject’s 
weight at Baseline (Visit 3). Subjects will receive treatment with NNZ-2591 
for a total of 13 weeks. During the treatment period there are three in-clinic 
visits: Week 2 (Visit 5), Week 6 (Visit 9) and Week 13 (Visit 16). There is a 
remote visit by [CONTACT_361714] a same-day in-home 
visit by a visiting nurse at Week 1, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 10. 
Additionally, there are in-home visits by a visiting nurse at Week 3, Week 5, 
Week 7, Week 9, Week 11, and Week 12. 
 
All subjects will have a combined remote follow-up visit with the 
Investigator via telemedicine and an in-person home visit by a visiting nurse 
approximately 2 weeks after the end of treatment (Week 15, Visit 17). 
 
For all visits designated as in-clinic, an in-person visit is preferred. All 
requests for off-site assessments due to extenuating circumstances related to 
the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) health emergency must be approved by 
[CONTACT_361715]. 
 
Enrollment Groups For enrollment, the subjects will be divided into three groups by [CONTACT_654]: 9–12-
year-olds (Group 1), 6–8-year-olds (Group 2), and 3–5-year-olds (Group 3). 
Enrollment will commence in the oldest age group (Group 1). After at least 
three subjects in Group [ADDRESS_450525] received two weeks of treatment with the IMP 
at the starting dose (4 mg/kg BID), safety and tolerability data will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_71333] (DSMC). If tolerability 
and safety data are deemed acceptable, enrollment for Group [ADDRESS_450526] of Clinical

Trials of Medical Products during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency .* 
Provision is made for off-site assessments where necessary, and all efforts 
have been made to ensure the alternative processes are consistent as much as 
possible with in-clinic visits. For visits that are designated as in-clinic, an 
actual in-clinic visit is preferred. However, an in-home/remote visit may be 
conducted for a scheduled in-clinic visit with the prior approval of the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor. Clinical investigators are to document the 
reason for any contingency measures implemented. If at any time in the 
study, the subject or his or her caregiver tests positive for severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or becomes ill with 
symptoms of COVID-19, the family should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_361716]. Once informed, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_22955]. 
Study Population Approximately 20 male and female subjects between the ages of 3 and 12 
years, inclusive, are planned to complete the study.  
The subjects will be categorized by [CONTACT_361717]: 9- to 12-year-olds 
(Group 1), 6- to 8-year-olds (Group 2), and 3- to 5-year-olds (Group 3). 
Enrollment will be balanced to the extent possible by [CONTACT_361718] a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_450527] meet all of the inclusion criteria 
and none of the exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria include: 
1. Clinical diagnosis of PMS with a documented disease-causing 
genetic abnormality of SHANK3.

dose is taken. At this visit, the site will provide IMP for the caregiver to 
dispense at home. Enough IMP will be provided to cover the interval until the 
next in-clinic visit when the caregiver will be re-supplied from the site. 
 
The protocol includes procedures for dose titration and dose adjustments, if 
any are necessary ( Section 7.2 ), and pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] (i.e., 
discontinuation of IMP) consistent with the exclusion criteria, including

Endpoints Primary Endpoints  
 
Safety: The incidence of AEs and SAEs from commencement of IMP administration 
through to the time of the last study visit will be evaluated. Vital signs, 
laboratory measures, urine output history, physical exam results 
(neurological, ophthalmologic, and general), findings, and 
ECGs will also be evaluated from screening/baseline through the end of the 
study.  
 
Tolerability will be assessed based on caregiver reports and the Caregiver 
Diary, required dosing adjustments or discontinuations, dosing compliance, 
and AEs related to subject experience. 
 
Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected according to the age 
appropriate sampling schedule for each subject (See Tables 2 and 3). 
Pharmacokinetic concentrations and exposure parameters for NNZ-2591 will 
be derived by [CONTACT_361720]-compartmental analysis (NCA), and may include 
maximum concentration (C max), area under the concentration-time curve 
from time 0 to the end of the dosing period (AUC tau), and other parameters. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
 
Efficacy: Within-subject changes will be assessed from the Baseline period to end of 
treatment.

deviation is larger, the size of the detectable difference would also be larger. 
For example, if the standard deviation is 1.5, the detectable difference for a 
power of 0.80, 0.85, and 0.90 is 1.02, 1.09, and 1.18 or larger, respectively. 
Statistical Methods Safety  
Adverse events and other safety data will be summarized as frequencies and 
percentages, described in terms of severity and potential attribution. 
Objective safety assessments will be summarized over time on study; shift 
tables at time points of interest may be generated.  Details of the safety 
analyses will be specified in the SAP. 
 
Efficacy 
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_361721]-subject changes from the 
Baseline period to the EOT. The subject’s baseline characteristics and 
symptom severity will be established based on assessments collected during 
the 4 to 6 week Screening/Baseline period. Baseline values will be based on 
the average values of Visits 1, [ADDRESS_450537] for improvement 
and a significance level will be computed.  
 
Potentially influential factors will be considered and addressed with a linear 
regression model. This model may include covariates such as age, sex, NVIQ 
or NVIQ equivalent, genotype, history of regression (yes/no), ASD diagnosis 
yes/no with no more than two covariates included in any model. Descriptive 
statistics and corresponding graphics will be used to present the results. The 
efficacy analysis details will be specified in the SAP. 
 
Pharmacokinetics: NNZ-[ADDRESS_450538] and time point for 
each dose level with actual time they were acquired. The concentrations will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_5586], dose level and age group. For the concentrations 
measured at trough points dose relationship will be examined statistically 
with age group and/or body weight of patient as covariate. 
Overall exposure parameters for NNZ-2591 such as C max and AUC tau may be 
derived by [CONTACT_361720]-compartmental analysis (NCA). Additionally, PK 
concentrations of NNZ-[ADDRESS_450539] NCA approach will 
be used for simulated profiles to calculate parameters C max, AUC tau, etc. for 
characterization of NNZ-2591 exposure in pediatric patients. 
The PK analysis details will be specified in the PK Statistical Analysis Plan 
(PK SAP).

a No assessments can be conducted until after informed consent has been given by [CONTACT_361724]. Training for 
the caregivers on all caregiver completed assessments must be done before the caregiver/rater may complete the assessments. The 
Screening/Baseline period will be conducted over 4 to 6 weeks. The second visit during the Screening/Baseline period (Visit 2) should be 
conducted 2 weeks day after the Screening visit (Visit 1). The subject will then remain in Screening for an additional [ADDRESS_450540] be completed daily during the entire Screening/Baseline period whether it is 4 weeks or 6 weeks. The Screening visit (Visit 1) 
and Baseline visit (Visit 3) may be conducted over three consecutive days. It is preferrable that ECGs, safety labs and biomarker sample collection 
are conducted on the same day. All assessments must be completed within the window for the visit (visit day ± 2 days). For Visit 3, all 
assessments must be completed before administration of the IMP. 
 
b The End of Treatment visit is conducted when the subject is still on IMP treatment. For early termination, in addition to study completers, 
subjects who have received IMP for longer than 2 weeks and discontinue prematurely any time after Visit 5 should return to the investigational site 
for final safety and efficacy assessments as scheduled for the EOT visit (Visit 16) and complete the study exit form. 
c At Visit 3, the first dose of IMP will be administered in the clinic after all Baseline assessments are completed, or, if the Investigator judges that 
it is too late in the day, on the following day. The subject should be monitored for at least three hours post first dose. If the first dose is 
administered the day following Baseline, vital signs (except height) should be collected before the dose is administered. Day [ADDRESS_450541] be 
done within the window for the visit.

samples for a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).  The nurse will also conduct a targeted physical exam assessing general appearance, 
abdominal/CVA tenderness, and edema. A suprapubic exam (bladder palpation) to assess for urinary retention may be performed.  The visiting 
nurse will also review the dosing diary, query oral intake, and do a review of tolerability. Blood samples for CBC with differential and coagulation 
will be collected at Weeks 4, 8, 10 and Week 15 (indicated by “N” in the Schedule of Assessments). At the post-treatment follow-up visit at Week 
15, the visiting nurse will also collect ECG, in addition to the above assessments. At Week 7, the site will also have a phone call with the caregiver 
to confirm that the child has started the new dose if they were approved for dose titration.  The site will confirm the visiting nurse has been 
informed so the dosing schedule can be reviewed with the family during the in-home visit. A nurse-only in-home visit may be conducted in-clinic 
by [CONTACT_361726]. See Section 9.1 and Section 9.2.  
g  The in-clinic physical exam will include an abdominal exam and an assessment of CVA. A suprapubic exam (bladder palpation) to assess for 
urinary retention may be performed.  General awareness will be captured as part of the neurological exam. For in-home nursing visits, the nurse 
will do a Targeted Physical exam assessing general appearance (e.g., alertness), an abdominal/CVA, and edema. A suprapubic exam (bladder 
palpation) to assess for urinary retention may be performed.

INTRODUCTION
5.1 Phelan-McDermid Syndrome
Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS, also referred to as 22q13 Deletion Syndrome) is a rare genetic 
neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by [CONTACT_361727], global developmental delay, absent 
speech/severe speech impediments, and moderate to profound intellectual disability.2-5  
Phelan-McDermid syndrome is caused by a deletion or other structural change to the terminal end of 
chromosome 22 in the 22q13 region, or a disease-causing mutation of the SHANK3 gene.6SHANK3 is a 
synaptic scaffolding protein expressed in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. 
Heterozygous deletions or point mutations of SHANK3 are thought to be the main cause of the 
neurodevelopmental features of PMS.7-9Most cases are caused by [CONTACT_361728]10, 11which may include 
terminal deletions and interstitial deletions. Loss of function can also be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_361693], 
ring chromosomes, and duplications.10This variable range of genetic changes gives rise to a wide range 
of medical, intellectual, and behavioral challenges.
The majority of cases of PMS occur spontaneously ( de novo ),12, 13while 15-20% of cases are inherited 
from a parent who carries the chromosomal abnormality.14, [ADDRESS_450549] low to very low adaptive behavior skills for 
daily living, reporting in <10thpercentile,7, 19-21and severe language impairments, with about half of these 
individuals remaining nonverbal.7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 20, 22-24  
Other difficulties for individuals with PMS include fine and gross motor deficits with delays in motor 
milestones, impairments in motor coordination, and gait abnormalities including toe walking, ataxic gait 
and steppage gait.4, 7, 12, 16, 18, 25Hypotonia is also a key feature of PMS, which affects early motor 
development, feeding, and postural control.4, 26  
Individuals with PMS are medically complex and present with a number of medical issues. Structural 
brain abnormalities are frequently present,9and arachnoid cysts occur more frequently (15%) than in the 
general population (1%).2, 9Individuals with PMS also have a higher rate of congenital heart defects.3, 9
Seizures occur in approximately 40-60% of affected individuals,3, 26-28and approximately 40% of 
individuals with PMS are reported to have sleep problems.16, 26, 29, [ADDRESS_450550] been 
observed in up to 53% of adults and adolescents with PMS.31 Additionally, a decreased perception of pain 
and decreased perspi[INVESTIGATOR_361694] a tendency to overheat.4, 5, 9, 16, 26  
Severe gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and 
constipation are commonly reported problems.3, 4, 16, 26, 32, 33Cyclic vomiting occurs in up to 25% of 
individuals with PMS, which can lead to esophageal irritation, weight loss and dehydration.9Feeding 
problems, choking and gagging, problems chewing, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_361695].2, 4, 26, 33Incontinence 
affects a majority of individuals with PMS including daytime urinary incontinence (73%), fecal
incontinence (79%), and nocturnal urinary incontinence (86%).32, 33Renal abnormalities are observed in 
up to 40% of patients.4, 16
Neurobehavioral characteristics include maladaptive behaviors and autism spectrum disorder or autistic 
behaviors.3-5, 9, 16, 19, 24Up to 87% of PMS patients also meet diagnostic criteria for autism.7, 10, 16, 19, 34, [ADDRESS_450551]-of-care treatment for PMS takes a coordinated, multi-disciplinary approach targeted to the 
individual’s specific needs. The approach can require physical, occupational, behavioral, and speech 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_361696] (AAC) 
approaches such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_361697].2, 4, [ADDRESS_450552] treatments and 
approximately 50% of individuals are under the care of a GI specialist.33 Treatments such as anti-
convulsants for mood stabilization, neuroleptics and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_361698]-morbidities or symptoms, often with concurrent treatment with multiple psychotropic 
medications including methylphenidate, alpha agonists, beta-blockers, SSRIs, valproic acid, lithium, 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_900]-psychotics and anti-depressants.24, 31, 36  
5.3 Genetic Basis of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome 
Impairment in the structure and function of synapses is a fundamental underlying feature of PMS. 
Deletions and mutations of the SHANK3 gene lead to insufficient amounts of active SHANK3 protein, 
which is a key scaffolding protein present in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Normally, 
SHANK3 protein strengthens and stabilizes these synapses by [CONTACT_1541] a “docking station” for other 
proteins involved in synaptic structure and function.38  
5.4 Cellular Pathology in Phelan-McDermid Syndrome 
The deficiency in active SHANK3 protein results in the biochemical, cellular, and morphological changes 
in the brain associated with PMS. Shcheglovitov et al.39 showed that in PMS, there are major impairments 
in excitatory synaptic transmission caused by [CONTACT_361729]. The level of Insulin-
Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in the brain is below normal in the Shank3  knockout model of PMS and in 
children with infantile autism in which SHANK3  mutations are prominent.[ADDRESS_450553] which plays an important role in 
regulating the cell cycle, gene expression, and protein synthesis41 and, as noted, is dysregulated in PMS. 
5.5 Scientific Rationale for use of NNZ-2591 in Phelan-McDermid Syndrome 
NNZ-2591 (Cyclo-L-Glycyl-L-2-Allylproline) is a new chemical entity that is a synthetic analogue of 
cyclic Glycine-Proline (cGP), a metabolite of IGF-1 that is present naturally in the brain. 
cGP has been reported to regulate binding of IGF-1 to IGF Binding Protein 3 in the brain and, as a 
consequence, regulate the bioavailability of IGF-1 in the brain.42 This auto-regulatory mechanism 
maintains homeostasis of IGF-1, increasing bioavailability when IGF-1 is deficient and decreasing 
bioavailability when IGF-1 levels are excessive. In animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders 
including PMS, Fragile X syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, NNZ-2591 has restored IGF-1 to wild-

STUDY DESIGN
7.1 Study Design Overview
This is a Phase 2, open-label study of the safety and tolerability of NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 50mg/mL in 
male and female children and adolescents with PMS. Approximately 20 male and female subjects 
between the ages of 3 and 12 years will be enrolled and receive treatment of NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 
50mg/mL for a total of 13 weeks. Additional subjects may be screened, enrolled, and treated to achieve 
approximately 20 study completers.
There will be a total of 17 study visits, comprising 5 in-clinic visits and 12 remote telemedicine/in-home 
nurse visits (see Section 7.1.1 ). The study will commence with an approximately 4 to 6 week Screening
and Baseline period. During this Screening/Baseline period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility
and data will be collected to establish the subject’s baseline characteristics and symptom severity using a 
variety of assessments (Section 9.2). Two in-clinic visits and one remote/in-home visit (Visits 1, 2, 3)
comprise Screening and Baseline. 
Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will receive the starting dose of 4 mg/kg and then be up-titrated to 
the target dose 12 mg/kg BID (see Section 7.2). Subjects will receive IMP for a total of 13 weeks. During 
the treatment period, there are three in-clinic visits: Week 2 (Visit 5), Week 6 (Visit 6) and Week 13 (Visit 
16). There is a combined remote, telemedicine visit by [CONTACT_361730]-home visit by a visiting 
nurse for safety at Week 1 (Visit 4), Week 4 (Visit 7), Week 8 (Visit 11) and Week 10 (Visit 13). These 
combination remote/in-home visits will be conducted simultaneously whenever possible, or they will be 
conducted on the same day with the telemedicine visit occurring first. If it is not feasible to conduct these 
visits simultaneously or on the same day, the telemedicine portion of the visit and the nurse portion of the 
visit must be conducted on two consecutive days. In-home visits with a visiting nurse will be done at Weeks 
3 (Visit 6), 5 (Visit 8), 7 (Visit 10), 9 (Visit 12), 11 (Visit 14), and 12 (Visit 15).
All subjects will also have a remote follow-up visit with the Investigator via telemedicine and an in-person 
home visit by a visiting nurse approximately 2 weeks after the end of treatment (Week 15, Visit 17). 
For all visits designated as in-clinic, an in-person visit is preferred. Off-site assessments may be allowed 
due to extenuating circumstances due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_450555] be approved in advance by [CONTACT_347188].
Subjects will be divided into three groups by [CONTACT_654]: 9 to 12 years old (Group 1)
6 to 8 years old (Group 2)
3 to 5 years old (Group 3)
Enrollment will commence with the oldest age group and will proceed as follows. After at least three 
subjects in Group [ADDRESS_450556] received two weeks of treatment at the starting dose, the Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) will review data on safety and tolerability. If tolerability and safety for those subjects 
during the specified period is deemed acceptable, enrollment for Group [ADDRESS_450557] not met any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] (Section 9.4.5 ), they can be down-titrated to the next 
lowest dose in the titration schedule. The Investigator must attempt to increase the dose as soon as it is 
possible based on the clinical situation. The aim is to return to the originally assigned dose. If the 
originally assigned dose cannot be reached or the subject is again unable to tolerate that dose, the 
Investigator will continue treatment on the highest dose that the subject can tolerate. 
 
 
Data from two weeks of dosing at each dose in the dose titration schedule will be reviewed by [CONTACT_361731]. Subjects will stay on their current 
dose until the DSMC has reviewed the data and approved the subjects to escalate to the next dose.  
 
After eligibility is confirmed, the subject will be administered NNZ-2591 IMP open label at a starting 
dose of 4 mg/kg BID for a total of approximately 3 weeks. After 2 weeks of dosing at 4 mg/kg BID, the 
DSMC will review the safety data. The subject will remain on the starting dose during the DSMC review.  
If the DSMC determines that tolerability and safety during the 2-week dosing period are acceptable, the 
subject will escalate to the next dose of 8 mg/kg BID and be dosed for a total of approximately 3 
additional weeks at that dose. After 2 weeks of dosing at 8 mg/kg BID, the DSMC will review the safety 
data. If the DSMC determines that tolerability and safety during the 2-week dosing period on 8 mg/kg 
BID are acceptable, the subject will then escalate to the target dose of 12 mg/kg BID. After 2 weeks of 
dosing at 12 mg/kg BID, the DSMC will review the safety data to determine if the subject can continue 
dosing at 12 mg/kg BID for the remainder of the 13 weeks.  
 
The site will inform the caregiver of the up-titration decisions as soon as possible after the site has 
received the official notification of the DSMC decision. The site will verify with the caregiver that 
instructions to up-titrate to 8 mg/kg BID have been followed at the Week 4 visit (Visit 7), and will verify 
with the caregiver that instructions to up-titrate to 12 mg/kg BID have been followed at the Week 7 visit 
(Visit 10).  If the DSMC has not yet approved the subject to escalate to the next dose by [CONTACT_361732], the site should contact [CONTACT_361733] [ADDRESS_450558] be conducted if 
possible. 
 
7.3 Treatment Assignment 
This is an open-label study in which all subjects will be assigned to NNZ-2591 Oral Solution, 50mg/mL 
and receive 13 weeks of treatment. All subjects will be titrated to the dose of 12 mg/kg BID or the highest 
tolerated dose based on the Titration Schedule in Section 7.2. The dose titration schedule may be 
modified based on updated PK modelling including data from the study. 
Subjects who are unable to tolerate the study treatment may be discontinued from the study.

STUDY PROCEDURES
9.1 Overview of Study Visits
There are a total of 17 study visits over the duration of the study: 5 in-clinic visits and 12 remote/in-home
visits (6 combined telemedicine/in-home nursing visits, and 6 in-home nurse visits; refer to the table of
assessments in Section 4). Remote visits between the Investigator or designee at the clinical site and the
subject at home are conducted via telemedicine or video facilities as appropriate. In-home visit refers to a
visit made to the subject’s home by a visiting nurse.
The Screening/Baseline period will be conducted over 4 to 6 weeks. The second visit during the 
Screening/Baseline period (Visit 2) should be conducted 2 weeks day after the Screening visit 
(Visit 1). The subject will then remain in Screening for an additional [ADDRESS_450578] be completed daily during the entire Screening/Baseline period whether it is 4 weeks or 6 weeks. 
The Screening visit (Visit 1) and Baseline visit (Visit 3) may be conducted over three consecutive days. It 
is preferrable that ECGs, safety labs and biomarker sample collection are conducted on the same day. No 
assessments can be conducted until informed consent has been given by [CONTACT_361738]. Also, training for the caregivers on all caregiver completed assessments must 
be done before the caregiver rater may complete the assessments. All assessments must be done within 
the window for the visit, as shown in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 4. For Visit 3, all 
assessments must be done before administration of the IMP.
The in-clinic visits will be conducted in person at the study site. As described below, safety and efficacy 
assessments will be completed by [CONTACT_8786]. The caregiver will also complete caregiver assessments 
the day of the visit or the day before the visit as described below (except the caregiver diary which is 
completed daily), and these will be reviewed by [CONTACT_8786]. In-clinic visits will be done at Screening 
(Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 3), Week 2 (Visit 5), Week 6 (Visit 9), and Week 13 (EOT, Visit 16). For all 
visits designated as in-clinic (Visits 1, 3, 5, 9 and 16), an in-person visit is preferred. Off-site assessments 
may be allowed due to extenuating circumstances such as the COVID-[ADDRESS_450579] be approved in advance by [CONTACT_347188].
The combined remote telemedicine/in-home visits will be done during Screening/Baseline at Visit 2, and 
post-enrollment at Week 1 (Visit 4), Week 4 (Visit 7), Week 8 (Visit 11), Week 10 (Visit 13) and Week 
15 (Visit 17).  The combined remote visit is conducted by [CONTACT_361739], and 
by a visiting nurse who will conduct assessments at the subject’s home. These combination remote/in-
home visits will be conducted simultaneously whenever possible, or they will ideally be conducted on the 
same day. If not possible, the telemedicine visit and the nurse visit may be conducted on separate days. In 
this case, the telemedicine portion and in-home nurse portion must be conducted over two consecutive 
days.. During Screening (Visit 2), the Investigator will review the medical history to determine if there 
are any changes in symptoms from the Screening visit (Visit 1). At post-enrollment visits, the Investigator 
will do a review of AE/SAEs and tolerability and conduct a recent clinical history. A modified version of 
the physical and neurological exam will be done by [CONTACT_361740]. At the in-home component of the visit during Screening 
(Visit 2), the nurse will collect vital signs, weight, do a Targeted Physical Exam assessing general
appearance, abdominal/CVA, and edema, and query oral intake. The nurse will review the caregiver diary 
during the visit and provide the family with a new section of the diary. Post-enrollment, for the in-home 
component of the combined visit, the nurse will collect urine, vital signs, weight, and blood samples for a 
comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count with differential (CBC) and coagulation, 
except for Week [ADDRESS_450580] a Targeted Physical 
Exam assessing: general appearance; the abdomen and the CVA region for tenderness; the extremities and 
peri-orbital region for edema.  A suprapubic exam (bladder palpation) to assess for urinary retention may

decreased urine output is noted.  
 
9.3 Screening and Baseline Procedures 
Screening and Baseline assessments are completed after informed consent during a period of 
approximately 4 to 6 weeks. During the Screening/Baseline period data will also be collected to establish 
the subject’s baseline characteristics and symptom severity based on assessments collected during the 
4 to 6 week period. There are two in-clinic visits and one remote/in-home visit for Screening and 
Baseline: Screening (Visit 1, in-clinic), Screening Visit 2, (combined remote/in-home nurse visit), 
Baseline (Visit 3, In-clinic). The second visit during the Screening period (Visit 2) should be conducted 
2 weeks ± 1 day after the Screening visit (Visit 1). The subject will then remain in Screening for an 
additional [ADDRESS_450581] be completed daily during the entire Screening period 
whether it is 4 weeks or 6 weeks.  
 
During the Screening visit (Visit 1), informed consent to participate in the study will be obtained from the 
parent or legally authorized representative.  
 
Subjects will be evaluated for the diagnosis of PMS and documented disease-causing genetic abnormality 
of SHANK3 . If the subject has been genotyped at any time in the past, these will not need to be repeated at 
Screening, provided the documentation of these tests is available for verification.

Mullen Scales of Early Learning or Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales v5 (SB5) 
The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales version 5 (SB5) assessment will be made at the Screening visit
(Visit 1) and EOT (Week 13, Visit 16). SB5 is validated for ages 2 to 85+ and measures both verbal and 
nonverbal intellectual and cognitive abilities through a set of 10 subtests.49General cognitive ability is 
reported as a full scale intellectual quotient score (FSIQ). Cognitive ability in five categories is reported 
in the index scores: fluid reasoning (FR), knowledge (KN), quantitative reasoning (QR), visual-spatial
processing (VS), and working memory (WM). Non-verbal (NVIQ) and verbal intelligence quotients 
(VIQ) are also calculated. Scoring of index scores and IQ will be calculated using the z-deviation method 
for intellectual disability.50

Page 86 of 117The Mullen Scales of Early Learning (Mullen) is to be conducted in subjects who are unable to obtain a 
basal level on SB5 or for whom the SB-5 is developmentally inappropriate. Assessment will be made at 
the Screening visit (Visit 1) and End of Treatment (Week 13, Visit 16). The Mullen is designed for ages 0 
to 68 months but can be used with individuals older than 68 months who are developmentally delayed.51
The Mullen assesses developmental and cognitive functioning in five categories: gross motor (GM), 
visual reception (VR), fine motor (FM), expressive language (EL), and receptive language (RL). 
Standardized t-scores are calculated for the 5 scales, and an Early Learning Composite score reflecting 
cognitive development can be calculated from four cognitive Mullen scales (VR, FM, RL, and EL). The 
Early Learning Composite score and scaled scores are calculated for children [ADDRESS_450590] within 3 months of Screening, 
the scores from that administration may be used if it meets the following criteria: 1) Assessment was 
administered by [CONTACT_8786], by [CONTACT_361745], or another study site; 2) the site has access to 
all the scores required to be entered in the EDC; 3) the site has permission to share the scores from the 
previously administered assessment to the study EDC. Assessments done by [CONTACT_361746]. Only scores from the SB-5 and the Mullen are acceptable; cognitive scores from other 
assessments cannot be entered in the EDC in lieu of the SB-5 or the Mullen. 
Both measures are used to assess cognitive and developmental status in the PMS Natural History study. 
MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MB-CDI)
The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MB-CDI) will be completed at Baseline 
(Visit 3) and EOT (Week 13, Visit 16). This caregiver-completed instrument assesses language 
development in vocabulary comprehension and production, gestures, and grammar.52Designed to assess 
early language development in infants and toddlers, it can also be used with older, developmentally
delayed children to assess developmental progress in language development. The MB-CDI includes three 
modules based on chronological or developmental age: Words and Gestures (8 to 18 months or 
developmental equivalent), Words and Sentences (16 to 30 months or developmental equivalent) and the 
CDI-III, an extension of the MB-CDI used with children 30 to 37 months (or developmental equivalent). 
The appropriate module will be used for this study in line with the cognitive and language development of 
the individual subject. The MB-CDI assesses developi[INVESTIGATOR_361701], and vocabulary comprehension and production which are reported as number of instances and 
percentile scores. 
ORCA (Observer-Reported Communication Ability Measure)
The Observer-Reported Communication Ability measure (ORCA) will be completed at Baseline (Visit 3) 
and EOT (Week 13, Visit 16). This caregiver-reported measure was originally developed and validated 
for Angelman syndrome53to assess the individual’s overall communicative ability, and was designed to 
capture communicative abilities in verbal and low-verbal/non-verbal populations, so is relevant for PMS. 
It was developed based on feedback from a patient-focused listening session with the advocacy 
community and the Food and Drug Administration following best practices for measure development 
including concept elicitation interviews with caregivers and communication experts, item generation, 
assessment of validity and psychometrics, and factor analysis confirming single overall communication 
ability score.53-55The rating scale evaluates the caregiver’s observation of the individual’s communication 
ability over the past 30 days.54The measure consists of 84 total questions with 70 behavioral items.It 
assesses communication abilities of individuals across all modalities: gestures, AAC (augmentative and 
alternative communication) and speech so is not dependent solely on verbal abilities. Twenty-two 
communication concepts relevant to communicative ability in PMS are assessed within the categories of

The Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Rating assessment is a syndrome-specific measure of 3 signs or symptoms 
of PMS identified by [CONTACT_361747] a result of treatment. The assessment will be completed at all Screening and Baseline 
visits (Visits 1, 2, 3), as well as Week 6 (Visit 9), EOT (Week 13, Visit 16), and the Follow-up (Visit 17). 
In this assessment, concerns are identified on an individual, per-subject basis. The clinician should review 
the assessment with the caregiver at the Screening visit, ideally as part of the overall medical and clinical 
history. Caregivers should be encouraged, in selecting the concerns, to identify distinct, observable 
symptoms rather than broad ones. And caregivers should be advised to consider symptoms that they feel 
are important and have an impact on their child’s daily functioning and well-being. 
Caregivers are asked to identify 3 concerns from among 10 clinically important symptom domains: 
Communication, Social interaction, Gross motor skills, Fine motor skills, Behavior, Gastrointestinal 
problems, Seizures, Sleep, Sensory Sensitivity, and Self-care skills. Each individual concern identified 
should be from a different symptom domain, but caregivers can select any domain, and choose any 
symptom of concern within that domain. The same three concerns identified at Screening/Baseline are 
carried forward and rated at the follow-up visits. The severity of each concern is scored by [CONTACT_361748] a 10-point Likert scale of severity. In rating, the caregiver should give consideration to symptoms 
within the last two weeks. 
  Aberrant Behavior Checklist-2 (ABC-2)
The ABC-2 will be completed at all Screening and Baseline visits (Visits 1, 2, 3), as well as Week 6 
(Visit 9), EOT (Week 13, Visit 16), and Follow-up (Visit 17). The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-2 (ABC-
2)56,57is a caregiver-completed rating scale for assessing problem behaviors that has been validated in a 
variety of clinical populations and been used as an outcome measure in clinical trials of NDDs across 
much of the lifespan.56The rater considers the relative frequency of an individual’s behaviors and gives a 
rating of the severity of the problem it presents: 0, not at all a problem; 1, the behavior is a problem but 
slight in degree; 2, the problem is moderately serious; 3, the problem is severe in degree. The caregiver 
should give consideration to symptoms within the last two weeks. 
The ABC-2 covers 58 symptoms providing five subscale scores: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, 
Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactive/Noncompliance, and Inappropriate Speech. These subscales have been 
shown to have good consistency, reliability, and validity with normative data available for specific 
populations including children with intellectual disability and ASD.58The ABC-2 is part of the 
assessment battery for the PMS-Natural history study. 
Behavior Problems Inventory-Short form (BPI-SF)
The Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI-SF) will be completed at Baseline (Visit 3) and at the EOT (Week 
13, Visit 16). The BPI-SF is a caregiver-completed rating scale for assessing self-injury, aggressive and 
stereotyped behavior.59Frequency is assessed for all three types of behavior on a five-point scale: 0 
(Never), 1 (Monthly), 2 (Weekly), 3 (Daily), and 4 (Hourly). For self-injury and aggression, severity is 
also assessed on a 3-point scale of mild, moderate, or severe.

Caregiver’s Impression of Change  
The Caregiver Impression of Change assessment will be done at the EOT visit (Week 13, Visit 16). The 
caregiver is asked to rate the change in his or her child’s overall function and well-being since the 
Baseline visit, and the change in specific symptoms. This is rated on a 7-point Likert scale: 1-Very much 
improved, 2-Much improved, 3-Improved, 4-Unchanged, 5-Worse, 6-Much worse, 7-Very much worse. 
For the rating of overall function, the caregiver also identifies the one symptom area or feature that has 
most influenced his or her rating of the child’s overall function and provides a description of symptom 
changes and impact of the changes. The assessment of change should be made since the Baseline visit
(Visit 3). The caregiver should assess the subject’s current state at the visit taking into consideration 
observations at the visit and symptoms within the last week. 
Quality of Life Inventory-Disability (QI-Disability) 
The Quality of Life Inventory-Disability (QI-Disability) will be completed at Baseline (Visit 3) and EOT
(Week 13, Visit 16).60-63The QI-Disability60is a caregiver-report measure that assesses a child’s well-
being and quality of life over the past month. Designed to be relevant for children who have an 
intellectual disability,60, 63the QI-Disability includes 32 questions in 6 domains: Social Interaction, 
Physical Health, Independence, Positive Emotions, Leisure and the Outdoors, and Negative Emotions. 
The QI-D has been validated in individuals ages 5 to 18 with Rett syndrome, Downs syndrome, CDKL5
Deficiency Disorder, Cerebral Palsy, and ASD. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale with a 0-100 
scaling such that the value of each rating is: never = 0, rarely = 25, sometimes = 50, often = 75, and very 
often is 100. Domain scores are calculated by [CONTACT_361749]. The total score is calculated by [CONTACT_361750]. 
Impact of Childhood Neurological Disability-Overall Quality of Life Rating
(ICND)
The Impact of Childhood Neurologic Disability Scale (ICND) will be administered at Baseline (Visit 3)
and at EOT (Week 13, Visit 16). The ICND was developed to evaluate the impact that a child’s condition 
has on the child’s and the family’s everyday life.64The full scale assesses the effect of four conditions or 
health problems on the child’s or the family’s life, and evaluates the child’s overall quality of life. In this 
study, only the overall quality of life assessment will be completed. The caregiver will rate overall quality 
of life of the subject by [CONTACT_361751]: “Please rate your child’s overall ‘Quality of Life’ on 
the scale below. Choose the number which you feel is best and circle it”. The choices range from 1 
(“Poor”) to 6 (“Excellent”). The caregiver should consider the child’s status in the last month including 
their current condition. 
Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)
The Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) will be completed by [CONTACT_423]’s caregiver at all 
Screening and Baseline visits (Visits 1, 2, 3), as well as Week 6 (Visit 9), EOT (Week 13, Visit 16), and 
Follow-up (Visit 17). The CSHQ assesses sleep behavior, waking during the night, and morning 
waking/daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]65to assess both behavioral and medical sleep disorders. The CSHQ has been 
used across a range of NDDs including PMS and has been used as an outcome measure for sleep 
intervention trials.66-69It provides a total score and eight subscale scores: bedtime resistance, sleep onset 
delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night awakenings, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, and 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. The caregiver should consider sleep behaviors within the last week in doing their 
ratings.

Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected in accordance with the sampling schedule outlined  in  
Table 2 for ages 7 to 12 years old and Table 3 for ages 3 to < 7 years old. The date and actual time (hour 
and minute) that each sample is collected must be accurately recorded. The site must also ensure that the 
date and time of the previously evening’s dose and the morning and evening dose on the day the sample is 
collected is accurately collected in the Caregiver Diary.  
For the Week 2, 6, and 13 data collection, the previous day’s PM dose should be taken in the evening as 
late as possible, preferably before bedtime. The pre-dose sample should be taken [ADDRESS_450591]-dose samples, sample collection can be +/- 15 
minutes of the target time and no closer than 30 minutes from the previous sample (must be at least 30 
minutes from the previous sample). The actual collection time is recorded. The post-dose windows are 
determined from the first dose of the visit (morning dose) and all PK samples should be collected before 
the second dose (PM dose). Full details regarding the PK sampling collection, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_361702]. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples may be collected from a cannula port or via venipuncture. Pre-prepared 
PK sampling tubes will be provided to each site within the lab visit kits for collection and storage of PK 
samples.  Samples of whole blood will be collected, aliquoted and will be stored at minus 20°C (or 
colder) no more than 2 hours following sample collection.  Samples will be shipped at designated times 
on dry ice and using temperature monitoring to the laboratory for storage and analysis. It is essential that 
accurate records are maintained regarding the date and time each PK sample is obtained, and the date and 
time each sample is placed in the 20°C freezer. The date and time of the most recent dose of IMP and 
most recent meal relative to that dose should be recorded in the Caregiver Diary.  
Minimum requirements for a subject to be considered evaluable within the PK population are 
administration of NNZ-2591 per protocol through to the morning dose at Week 2 (Visit 5) as a minimum, 
and collection of PK samples at the specified post-dose time point(s) through to Week 2 (Visit 5) as a 
minimum.

ADVERSE EVENTS
The Investigator and site staff are responsible for detection, recording and reporting of events that meet 
the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE), as described below.
At in-home nurse visits, the nurse will do a query of any changes for potential AE/SAEs and document 
observations from the targeted physical exam. The nurse will escalate any issues related to AE/SAEs, 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], major dosing issues, or issues of potential safety concern to the Investigator the same 
day. Any changes noted will be provided to the Investigator who will be responsible for determining, 
recording, and reporting any events that qualify as AE/SAEs. 
10.[ADDRESS_450592] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without 
any judgment about causality.  
AEs can include the following:Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
Conditions detected or diagnosed after IMP administration even though it may have been present 
prior to the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either IMP or a concurrent 
medication.
SAEs are a sub-category of AEs that are defined in Section 10.2, below. AEs/SAEs are recorded and 
reported from the time of first dose of IMP until Follow-up (Visit 17). 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_361703] a disease that existed prior to administration of IMP or 
enrollment at the clinical study are not to be considered AEs. Individuals who have planned surgical 
procedures that would occur during the study are to be excluded from the study (Exclusion 43).  If the 
subject has a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (non-surgical), the Investigator should consult with the Medical 
Monitor to ensure this will not cause disruption of IP administration or would not qualify the subject for 
exclusion. 
Note that medical or surgical procedures are not considered AEs (e.g., endoscopy); however the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE.
10.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse 
event, in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent the outcomes listed in 
this definition.
Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Clinical Trial Protocol   Version 3.0 
Confidential Neu-2591-PMS-001     October 30, 2023 
 
  Page 92 of 117  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.4 Adverse Reactions 
An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_9934]. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
Suspected adverse reactions means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. 
10.5 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as AEs and 
SAEs 
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. CBC with differential, liver function, renal function, biochemistry, 
urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g. ECGs, vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_361752] (new findings or worsening of baseline findings that are clinically 
impactful) will be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE, as defined in Section 
10.1 (Definition of Adverse Event), or SAE, as defined in Section 10.2 (Definition of Serious Adverse 
Event).  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
detected during the study and significantly worsen following the start of the study will be reported as AEs 
or SAEs. 
The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal 
laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. 
10.6 Time Period, Frequency, and Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study 
(i.e., before on-study informed consent obtained) that do not result in the exclusion of the subject from 
participating in the study, should be recorded as Medical History. In addition, any medical occurrence 
which is reported after informed consent is obtained, but prior to the subject receiving IMP, should be 
documented as Medical History. If a baseline sign or symptom worsens following dosing, then this should 
be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate.

  Page 94 of 117  relationship of the event to the IMP will be considered and investigated. The Investigator will also consult 
the Investigator’s Brochure in the determination of his/her assessment.   
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_361704] a ‘reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event’ and on that basis be classified as either 
‘related’ or ‘not related’. 
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to 
include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important that the Investigator always 
make an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of the SAE form to the Sponsor.  
The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information, amending the 
SAE form accordingly.   
 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each subject and 
provide further information to the Sponsor on the subject’s condition. 
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_5258], will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts. 
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, or until [ADDRESS_450593]’s 
Follow Up visit (Visit 17). At which time, the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF page(s) will be updated. SAEs 
and g. renal AEs that are ongoing at the Follow-up visit (Visit 17) will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization of subject condition, or study end, whichever occurs first. In such cases, follow-up Serious 
Adverse Event Report (SAER) or Renal Adverse Event (RAER) forms will be completed at the Follow-
up visit (Visit 17) as well as completed upon resolution, stabilization, or study end, whichever occurs 
first. “Study end” is when all subjects have completed the study. 
The Investigator will ensure that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated 
to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
The Sponsor may request that the Investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or 
SAE. The Investigator is obligated to assist. If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a 
recognized follow-up period, the Sponsor will be provided with a copy of the death certificate and any 
post-mortem findings, including histopathology. 
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE or Renal Adverse Event 
form, with all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_737]. The updated SAE form should be resent to 
the Sponsor within the time frames outlined below in Section 10.8 Prompt Reporting of the SAEs to the 
Sponsor.  
Any clinical adverse event that is serious (as defined above in Section 10.2)  
 occurring during the course 
of the study, irrespective of the treatment received by [CONTACT_423], must be reported to the Sponsor and 
Sponsor’s agent within 24 h (or sooner if possible) of the Investigator or designee becoming aware of the 
situation.

causality. This includes renal AEs that meet criteria for an SAE. In addition, the SAE is to be recorded on 
the appropriate section of the eCRF. The SAER must be submitted to the Pharmacovigilance Team at the 
email belowwithin [ADDRESS_450595] observed.  
Submit SAER form via email within 24 hours of the event

The Medical Monitor or pharmacovigilance department will contact [CONTACT_361754]. The Investigator should provide follow-up information 
for the event to pharmacovigilance department as soon as it becomes available. If required, the 
Investigator should report these events to the local IRB. 
The SAE form will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event 
and signed by [CONTACT_737] (or authorized designee). If the Investigator does not have all information 
regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to receive additional information before notifying the Medical 
Monitor of the event and completing the form. The form will be updated when additional information is 
received. 
The Investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report as 
described in Section 10.7.[ADDRESS_450596]’s health or well-being will be reported to the Pharmacovigilance Team, who will be in copy of  
Medical Monitor.  
In accordance with applicable regulations and local laws, the Sponsor will identify and report within the 
required time frame to regulatory authorities and Investigators all adverse events assessed as likely drug 
related that are determined to be both serious and unexpected. Investigators will be responsible for 
reporting this safety information to their IRB.

It is not expected that there will be sexually active participants in the study population, and as such some 
of the provisions that follow may have limited applicability based on the age range of study participants 
and the nature of the disease under study. These provisions are nonetheless included for purposes of 
completeness.  
Subjects of childbearing potential must abstain from sexual activity for the duration of the study and for at 
least [ADDRESS_450597] use 2 clinically acceptable methods of contraception (e.g., oral, intrauterine device [IUD], 
diaphragm plus spermicide, injectable, transdermal or implantable contraception, condom use alone (male 
type only)) for the duration of the study and for at least [ADDRESS_450598]’s baseline characteristics and symptom severity will be established based on assessments 
collected during the 4 to 6 week Screening/Baseline period. Baseline values will be based on the average 
values of visits 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_450599] significance level will be computed. 
Potentially influential factors will be considered and addressed with a linear regression model. This model 
may include covariates such as age, sex, nonverbal IQ (NVIQ) or NVIQ equivalent, genotype, history of 
regression (yes/no), ASD diagnosis (yes/no) with no more than two covariates included in any model. 
Descriptive statistics and corresponding graphics will be used to present the results. The safety and 
efficacy analysis details will be specified in the SAP.
11.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
The PK analysis will be based on the endpoints listed in Section 6.3.1 . Pharmacokinetic (PK) measures 
will be collected from all subjects at Visits 5 (Week 2), 9 (Week 6,) and 16 (Week 13, EOT). 
NNZ-[ADDRESS_450600] and time point for each dose level with actual time 
they were acquired. The concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_5586], dose level, and age group. For the 
concentrations measured at trough points dose relationship will be examined statistically with age group 
and/or body weight of subject as covariate.
Overall exposure parameters for NNZ-2591 such as C maxand AUC taumay be derived by [CONTACT_361720]-
compartmental analysis (NCA). Additionally, PK concentrations of NNZ-[ADDRESS_450601] 
NCA approach will be used for simulated profiles to calculate parameters C max, AUC tau, etc. for 
characterization of NNZ-2591 exposure in pediatric subjects. 
The PK analysis details will be specified in the PK SAP.
11.6 Biomarkers and Microbiome
Blood and stool samples will be collected for an exploratory analysis of biomarkers and gut microbiome. 
The analysis will be detailed in a separate analysis plan but will not include DNA sequencing. Samples 
will be collected at Screening (Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 3, before dosing) and at the EOT visit (Week 
13, Visit 16), or upon early termination.

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND DATA MANAGEMENT
13.1 Data Quality Assurance 
The following measures will be implemented to ensure accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of data:
Investigator discussions
Site initiation training
Early site visits following enrollment
Routine site management
Ongoing site communication and training
Periodic site monitoring 
Data management quality control checks
Statistical quality control checks
Continuous data acquisition and cleaning
Internal review of data
Quality control check of the final study report
13.[ADDRESS_450605] 
identification data, visit date(s), assessment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy will require 
explanation. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to source documentation at the site.
During periodic monitoring visits, the site will make their computer and/or high-speed Internet access 
available to the Study Monitor so that he or she may verify the data entries with the source 
documentation.  
13.3 Monitoring
A Sponsor’s Study Monitor will visit each site in accordance with the Clinical Monitoring Plan set forth 
for this trial as well as maintain regular telephone and written communication. Monitoring visits will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_361757] 
(GCP), and applicable regional regulations and guidelines.
The Investigator will agree to the monitors making periodic site visits during the study. The timing of 
these visits will be agreed by [CONTACT_361758]. 
Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Clinical Trial Protocol   Version 3.0 
Confidential Neu-2591-PMS-001     October 30, 2023 
 
  Page 103 of 117  Monitoring will be on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_3725]. The study assessments are to be captured on a specialized 
device/computer (e.g., 12-lead ECG), in an online or paper format (e.g., clinician and caregiver rating 
scales) and are to be obtained at the time of testing. It is imperative that the Investigator ensures that all 
tests are completed at each session, according to the subject’s capability. Data collected at the site will be 
entered into eCRFs in the centralized, password protected EDC system. Checking for completeness and 
rationality will be undertaken via the EDC at a central location. If discrepancies are noted, the site 
monitor will be alerted and site follow-up undertaken in order that problems may be resolved 
immediately. This may require retraining of investigators on the testing process and the importance of 
competing the testing correctly.  
13.4 Auditing 
The Sponsor (or Sponsor nominee) may conduct periodic audits of the study processes including, but not 
limited to, the clinical site and the bioanalytical laboratory. The Investigator must authorize access and 
make available all study related documents to authorized Sponsor’s representatives and regulatory 
authorities. 
The scope of a clinical site audit may include but will not be limited to, drug accountability, regulatory 
documentation, the informed consent process, and comparison of eCRFs against source data. The 
Investigator agrees to participate with audits conducted at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner. 
Regulatory agencies involved with the study may also audit the Investigator during or after the study. The 
Investigator should contact [CONTACT_76631]. 
13.5 Source Documents 
The Investigator will, within reason, prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents (e.g., 
medical records, ECGs, raw data collection forms, and electronic source documents) to record all 
observations and other pertinent data for each subject enrolled into the study. The Investigator will allow 
Sponsor representatives and authorized regulatory authorities to access documents pertaining to the study. 
13.[ADDRESS_450606] requires immediate intervention, based on the 
judgment of the Investigator (or appropriately qualified designee). In the event of a significant deviation 
from the protocol, the Investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_361759]. This will allow an early joint decision regarding the subject’s 
continuation in the study. The Investigator will document the outcome of the discussion in the source 
documents and the Sponsor likewise will retain a documentary record of the decision. The Sponsor will

15.2 Data Safety Monitoring Committee
An independent DSMC will monitor the progress of the trial and ensure that the safety of trial subjects is 
not compromised. The DSMC will provide independent affirmation that no safety or tolerability issues 
are arising in the study through their on-going review of the study data. Specifically, the DSMC will 
review the clinical safety data prior to any individual dose titration and prior to initiation of subsequent 
age groups. The DSMC will review safety data and make an adjudication on: 1) the ability for any 
individual subject to escalate to the next higher dose and 2) the ability for enrollment to begin in the 
younger age groups (Groups 2 and 3).
The DSMC will consist minimally of a clinical chair, another physician experienced in clinical trials with 
pediatric expertise (but not participating in this study), and a pediatric cardiologist. The DSMC Charter 
details the DSMC processes, duties, and responsibilities as well as the study-wide stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].

Allometric scaling to determine phase 2 exposures
To determine the appropriate dose for pediatric patients, the Sponsor performed allometric scaling as 
discussed with the FDA in the Pre-IND Meeting. The findings from the allometric scaling analysis are 
summarized below . 
The allometric scaling analysis was performed using the pharmacokinetic data from the Phase 1 study of 
NNZ-2591 in healthy adults (PK Report Neu-2591-HV-001). The purpose of the allometric scaling is to 
predict exposure in younger and lighter patients based on observed exposures in adult healthy volunteers 
at steady-state from the completed clinical study (Neu-2591-HV-001) for the dose of 12 mg/kg (cohort
M2). 
1. Methods for the Allometric Scaling
Steady-state PK parameters were used in the modeling. Median and percentiles were estimated for steady-
state clearance CLss/F on Day 7 morning dose for the adult subjects in the Neu-2591-HV-001 study to be 
used as input for allometric scaling. Median and 5th and 95th percentiles for the AUC tauat steady-state for 
the adult subjects were used as a target exposure in children for comparison of the results. 
Fi value was already accounted for in the apparent steady state clearance CLss/F. The WT centered value for 
the study was median body weight for the subjects in M1 and M2 cohorts of the study Neu-2591-HV-001 
was equal to 73 kg. 
Median CLss/F derived for steady-state exposure for Day 7 morning dose was used as CL TV. Since the 
CLss/F was derived for body weight adjusted doses and hence was estimated as L/h/kg for the 
simulations, the value was multiplied by [CONTACT_361767] 73 kg to represent true value for the 
population of adult subjects in the study Neu-2591-HV-001. 
For simulation of exposure for children 3-17 (covering the planned age group for this Phase 2 study and 
studies in PTHS and AS with children up to 17 years old), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) Growth Individual charts with 3rd and 97th percentiles (3rd, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 
97th) were downloaded from the CDC.gov website. The body weights for boys and girls from 36.5 
months (3 years) to 17 years old (203.5 months) inclusive were combined for the input to Phoenix 
WinNonLin as a csv file. The file contained columns for 3rd, 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, and 
97th percentiles for each month of age and gender individually. Column with gender was added for the 
combined dataset. Age groupi[INVESTIGATOR_361705] 1 (3 to < 6), Group 2 (6 
to <12), and 12-17.
The equation for allometric scaling was implemented in the Data Wizard function of Phoenix WinNonLin 
using weight for children of different age, gender, and percentile as direct input. 
Doses were varied in the range from 11 to 20 mg/kg for final estimate with 1 mg/kg increments. The dose 
levels 11, 12, 13, 14, … 20 mg/kg were used to calculate the related exposures for different body weight 
values and compare the resulting AUC tauvalues with adult results. 
Additionally, a 17.5-mg/kg dose was evaluated for the lowest body weights. Preliminary evaluation of 
suitable doses was done starting from 3 mg/kg dose levels. The parameters derived for this allometric 
scaling were AUC tauat steady state to compare with adult exposures.
Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Clinical Trial Protocol   Version 3.[ADDRESS_450615] doses and multiple steady-state doses of 
NNZ-2591 in healthy adult subjects. Evaluation of dose proportionality supported the application of the 
published allometric scaling formula to steady state exposure parameter AUC tauto be matched to adult 
exposures using body weight normalized dose in mg/kg and apparent steady state clearance in healthy 
adult subjects. The predicted exposures (steady-state AUC tau) were calculated from adult median CLss/F, 
estimated for morning and evening 12 mg/kg doses on Day 7 in the study Neu-2591-HV-001, for 
different dose values and body weights from CDC Growth Chart. 
The findings showed that overall, the predicted pediatric exposures were lower than adult exposures for 
the 12mg/kg dose for comparisons of exposure for different dose values versus weight. Combining the 
dose into 3 age groups resulted in significant overlap of body weight and differences in the dose projected 
to match adult exposure for 12 mg/kg dose within the group. Hence, body weight-based dosing instead of 
age-related dosing was originally proposed for the dose selection for children. The combined plots of 
AUC tauvs weight are shown in Figure A 1.

administered to the older group instead of exposure-equivalent weight-based doses at higher nominal 
doses. Given that it was estimated from allometric scaling that exposures would be lower for children < 
70 kg at 12 mg/kg than for adults at 12 mg/kg, dosing all children at a maximum of 12 mg/kg will not put 
them at risk of exposures higher than that experienced by [CONTACT_361768]. So, this approach to the dosing 
maintains the balance between risk and benefit for this first Phase 2 study in the Phelan McDermid 
syndrome population.

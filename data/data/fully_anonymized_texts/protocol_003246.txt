  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752274] angiography (CTA) with multidetector  
computed tomography (MDCT) has been used extensively to characterize 
coronary artery plaque composition, there is little data regarding its 
reproducibility .  A recent study demonstrated excellent reproducibility for this 
technique  but this study was perfo rmed using the older [ADDRESS_752275] 
scanners.  
1.0 Introduction  
1.1  Study Objectives : 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that use of 
atherosclerosis imaging to set targets for cholesterol lowering therapy will 
result in greater regression of atherosclerosis than standard therapy.  
 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the wall volume of the 
internal carotid arteries as measured by [CONTACT_9252].   
 
Secondary endpoints are  
A. Arterial stenosis and plaque volume  measured by [CONTACT_573066]  
B. Dosage of statin medications required to achieve LDL targets.   
C. Combined incidence of stroke, nonfatal MI, myocardial 
revascularization, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_573052] . 
D. FDG plaque uptake within the carotid and coronary arteries.  
  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752276] lipid lowering 
approach i.e., guided by [CONTACT_573067] s.   
 
  The clinical efficacy of lipid modifying therapy to reduce cardiovascular 
(CV) endpoints has been demonstrated in multiple trials. Current 
recommendations for the initiation and titration of lipid therapy rely on 
evaluation of clinical and laboratory markers to estimate risk.  
Approximately half of patients with cardiovascular disease present with 
sudden death as their first indicatio n of underlying atherosclerosis.  Most 
patients who suffer a first heart attack fall into a “low risk” categorization 
by [CONTACT_573068].  Although cardiovascular disease is the 
most common cause of death in women, it is virtually impossible for 
women to reach the level of intermediate or high risk by [CONTACT_573069] [ADDRESS_752277] scanners will be used to measure atheroma volume in 
the coronary arteries  and differentiate between  calcified and non -calcified 
lipid-rich and/or fibrous lesions .  We hypothesize that guidance of lipid 
modifying therapy using imaging assessment of atherosclerosis to 
intensify or reduce lipid lowering therapy in patients with respectively 
greater or lesser plaque volume at the baseline examination will result in 
great er plaque regression and stabilization than standard NCEP guided 
therapy with the same or superior safety and/or treatment adherence 
profiles.   
 
In a subset of individuals we plan to look at plaque inflammation using 
FDG PET.  Molecular imaging compliment s traditional anatomical imaging 
  Version Date:   10/26/17 
6 approaches that identify plaque structure and composition.   
 
It is widely postulated in the literature that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
imaging can improve risk assessment and prognostication through the 
identification of  high-risk “vulnerable” plaques, plaques that demonstrate 
heightened inflammation, neovascularization or apoptosis.  The primary 
target is the carotid and coronary arteries,  imaging will also include  the 
ascending and descending aorta, and the iliac arteri es.  Successful FDG 
PET imaging has been performed in large vascular beds, including the 
carotid arteries, and recent preliminary reports suggest the potential for 
noninvasive coronary plaque imaging.  The advantage of nuclear imaging 
is that multiple vasc ular beds can be imaged with a single radionuclear 
isotope administration.  
  
In a subset of [ADDRESS_752278] for measuring arterial stenosis and plaque volume.  This data 
will allow investigators to determine whether measured changes in 
stenoses and plaque morphology exceed that expected from the limits of 
measurement error i n CTA and thus make the results of ongoing trials 
more reliable.  
 
 Consistent with such objectives, our specific aims are:  
 
1st Aim  
To examine whether image guided lipid lowering therapy is superior to 
NCEP guided therapy in promoting carotid atherosclero tic plaque 
regression and stabilization.   
 
2rd Aim  
To investigate whether the observed change in carotid atherosclerosis 
volume measured by [CONTACT_66243], parallels observed change in coronary 
atherosclerosis volume measured by [CONTACT_117715].  
 
3rd Aim 
To examine whether MRI guided plaque regression and stabilization 
produces greater reduction in clinical CV events than standard NCEP guided 
therapy.  
 
 4th Aim  
To examine the statin dosages required to promote plaque regression and 
stabilization differ b etween conventional and image guided strategies.   
 
5th Aim  
To investigate whether FDG PET activity predicts carotid morphological 
plaque regression and stabilization in both the carotid and coronary 
arteries and compare the efficacy of PET based predictio n with MRI.  
  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752279] therapy in a 
randomized, controlled clinical trial.  The results of this trial will be directly 
applicable to improvement of strategies for plaque stabilization and 
prevention o f atherosclerotic events.   
 
1.3 Design  
 
Study design:  This is a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which [ADDRESS_752280] tertile of carotid wall volume (using 
the MESA study as a reference population(4)) will have statin therapy 
adjusted to a target LDL between 100 -130 mg/dL.  Patients in the middle 
tertile will  receive statin therapy to an LDL target of 70 -100 mg/dL.  
Patients in the highest tertile will receive statin therapy to achieve LDL -c 
levels below  70 mg/dL.  Participants will be randomized in a equal  ratio 
into imaging guided and control groups, respect ively.  This recruitment 
goal is designed to account for an estimated 20% attrition rate and 
maintain adequate power at the 24 month endpoint.  
 
 
  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752281] statin therapy adjusted to a target range of 100 -130 mg/dL   
Participants in the middle tertile will receive statin therapy adjusted to 
achieve a target LDL 70 -100 mg/dL.   Participants with the most severe 
atherosclerosis will receive statin therapy to an LDL target between 40 
and 70 mg/dL.  Participants in the control  arm will have lipid sub -fraction 
targets determined according to estimated [ADDRESS_752282] NCEP guidelines.

Subjects assigned to both arms of the study will undergo carotid MR for 
plaque evaluation at baseline, [ADDRESS_752283] carotid images will be 
acquired with dual 3 inch surface coils (phased array) positioned 
immediately below the angle of the mandible on  each side of the neck. 
The protocol will be same as previously used in studies performed at the 
N.I.H. by [CONTACT_573070] (5), adapted by [CONTACT_6283]. Bluemke and Lima as part 
of the MESA carotid MR imaging protocol and used by [CONTACT_573071], Lima 
and Bluemke in the  NIA Plaque study. (AHA Scientific Sessions 2009, 
manuscript under review ) Initial images will be acquired as a three -
dimensional volume using a 3D variable flip angle TSE sequence 
(SPACE) at 0.8 mm3 isotropic resolution, in 64 partitions using GRAPPA 
with 2-fold acceleration.  This sequence will be T2 weighted with a 
TR=1300 ms and TE 123 ms.    The 3D volume data will be used to 
determine the course and orientation of the common and internal carotid 
arteries bilaterally, and to determine the location of t he carotid flow divider 
(bifurcation).  This sequence will be used to guide placement of baseline 
non-contrast images covering two 2.[ADDRESS_752284] resolution of 500 -600 microns. 
Image s will be obtained with both short TE=5msec (PDW weighted 
images) and long TE=60msec (T2 weighted images) with inversion times 
adjusted to minimize blood pool signal (approximately 600 ms) and 
repetition times of one and two cardiac cycles (RR intervals). After 
contrast administration the same carotid targets will be re -imaged as 
described above. Inversion time will be reduced from [ADDRESS_752285].  
 
  Version Date:   10/26/17 
10 Data Analyses of Carotid MR imaging  
 
Co-investig ators blinded to the results of treatment group assignment and 
patient characteristics will be responsible for the measurement of all  MR 
outcome variables, specifically lumen area, wall volume fibrous content 
and lipid core.  Measurements will be performe d using commercially 
available semiautomatic contouring software (QPlaque, Medis Inc) 
workstation.  Vessel contours will be reviewed by [CONTACT_573072]. Measurements for the primary study endpoints will be obtained 
from the post -contrast enhanc ed sequences as these provide the best 
definition of the vessel wall and lipid core.(4)  T2 images will be used for 
confirmation of these measurements on the post -contrast series when 
necessary.  As previously reported, the lipid component of plaque is hyp o-
intense on T2 images, while fibrous components are isodense (6-8). The 
primary study outcome variables will be measured from the [ADDRESS_752286]  
 
1)  Coronary calcium scan   
Will be performed using the following protocol:  
 -No contrast.  
 -CT Imaging:  tube voltage = 120kV, tube current = 140  mA, gantry 
rotation speed = 0.35 seconds, slice thickness = 0.5 mm, rows = 256 -320, 
range = 128 -160 mm.  X -ray tube will be on for a total of 0.35 seconds.  
Estimated radiation dose = 1.5 mSv.  
 
2)  Rest Coronary arterial imaging  
Coronary  arterial imaging will be performed during a 4 -5 ml/sec 
intravenous iodinated contrast (ISOVUE®-370) infusion using the following 
parameters:  If heart rate is < 66  bpm   prospective ECG gating at 70 -80% 
of one R -R interval, X -ray exposure time ranges from  0.423 – 0.350 s ec 
(depending on heart rate). If heart rate is ≥ 66  bpm   prospective ECG 
gating at 40 -80% of two R -R intervals, X -ray exposure time ranges from  
1.174 sec – 0.714 sec (depending on heart rate) tube voltage = 120kV, 
tube current = 300 -580 mA depending on  BMI and gender, gantry rotation 
speed = 0.35 or 0.375 seconds, slice thickness = 0.5 mm, rows = 256 -320, 
range = [ADDRESS_752287] bolus arrival and optimize image quality.  
 
The estimated radi ation dose for the entire cardiac computed protocol 
(Calcium scoring (1.5 mSv) + Coronary arterial imaging (3 -9 mSv) is 4.5 
mSv to 10.5 mSv depending on patient heart rate, BMI, and gender.  Beta -
blockers will be used to control the heart rate and thus mai ntain the 
radiation dose as low as reasonably achievable.  Depending on patient 
size, a maximum of 2 ml/kg iodinated contrast will be used up to a 
maximum of 130 ml.  
 
  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752288] 
heart rate and blood pressure measured, and will be assessed for 
contraindications to beta blockade (bradycardia, heart block, active 
wheezing, history of adverse reaction).   
 
 
Since the approach to pre -scan beta -blockade is unique to the individual 
participant, the supervising physician customizes the dose on an individual 
subject to achieve a goal heart rate of less than [ADDRESS_752289] appears capable of tolerating the additional 
medication.   Vital signs will be obtained and documented fol lowing metoprolol 
administration.   If at any time the heart rate is <50 bpm and/or the systolic BP is 
<100, the supervising physician will be notified.   All participants will be assessed 
ofr symptoms of bradycardia, hypotension and orthostasis after scan c ompletion.  
 
 
Nitrate therapy  
 
The use of short acting nitrates (i.e. sublingual nitroglycerine) just prior to 
MDCT is required for patients with systolic blood pressure >110mmHg to 
allow for accurate assessment of the degree of coronary artery stenosis, 
reduce vasospasm and to standard ize vasomotor tone.  Potential 
contraindications to nitroglycerine use should be reviewed prior to 
administration (known allergy or severe intolerance, critical aortic stenosis, 
pre-existing hypotension).  If the patient cannot receive nitroglycerine (due 
to intolerance, borderline blood pressure, investigator judgment), the 
patient may still proceed with the study. Known risks of nitroglycerine use 
include headache, reduction in blood pressure, hypotension.  
 
CT image analysis  
 
CT angiogram images will be reconstructed and post -processed on a 
separate workstation using Vitrea (Vital Images, Inc) software.  The 
coronary tree will be segmented for analysis using a 16 segment AHA 
model according to the CORE -64 protocol  (9).  Vessels larger than 1.[ADDRESS_752290] lesion per segment will be 
assessed.  Luminal stenosis will be measured using semi -automated 
software. The spatial volume contained within the visible external wall of 
the vessel and the volume of the vessel lumen w ill be measured. A 
standardized under -patient phantom will be included in each scan to 
permit between -scan correction of density measurements.    
  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752291] 
administration and arrhythmia.  
Coronary calcification  
Coronary calcification will be measured by [CONTACT_573073] n(10) method, 
correcting lesion area by [CONTACT_573074].  A 
density independent volume score will also be calculated.  Total coronary 
artery calcium scores will be generated by [CONTACT_573075], left anterior desce nding, left circumflex and right coronary 
arteries.  Readers will be blinded to subject identity.   
Plaque quantification  
 
Raw data will be reconstructed at 0.[ADDRESS_752292] processed and analyzed by 
[CONTACT_573076] (Sure Plaque, Toshiba Medical Systems). Lumen 
and wall boundaries of target vessels will be semi -automatically detected 
on cross sectional images. Under the guide  of stretched multiplanar 
reconstructed image (SPR), two experienced readers will review and edit 
lumen and outer wall contours of coronary segments of the left anterior 
descending coronary artery (LAD), left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) 
and right coro nary artery (RCA) from ostium to vessel diameter > 2.0mm 
from cross sectional image by [CONTACT_233963] 1.[ADDRESS_752293], blur, or stent will be excluded. Volume estimates are obtained by 
[CONTACT_573077]. Cor onary wall volume 
is computed by [CONTACT_573078].  
 
To quantify coronary lumen volume, vessel wall volume, and total vessel 
volume by [CONTACT_573079]: 1) cor onary lumen volume/ vessel volume 
(LV/VV), 2) coronary wall volume/ vessel volume (WV/VV) and 3) coronary 
wall volume/ lumen volume (WV/LV) (Fig. 1). The greatest value for all 
indices obtained for each vessel and patient will be recorded.

 PET Substudy  
 
A subgroup of  60 patients will be recruited to participate in PET scanning 
which will be performed twice, once at study initiation and after 6 months 
of trial -directed statin therapy.   
 
Information including cardiovascular risk factors and other medication, 
including  anti-inflammatory drugs, use will be collected. The total 
cholesterol and LDL levels and the dosage of statins required to achieve 
that target will be recorded.  
 
Inclusion Criteria : 
Participants who are not participating in the CT Reproducibility study are 
eligible.  
 
Exclusion Criteria : 
Patients who are unable or unwilling to comply with the physical activity 
restrictions or fast for [ADDRESS_752294] be 
within normal limits, less than 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/ L).  
 
Hematological Biomarkers Markers : 
Blood tests for inflammatory markers will be incorporated into the baseline 
and [ADDRESS_752295] investigations will include C -reactive 
protein, matrix metalloproteinase -3 and -9, interleukin -18, cathep sin K, 
fibrinogen, adiponectin, and plasminogen activator .12-13 A tube of blood will 
be stored at -70oC for testing of further markers defined at a later date.  
 
FDG PET Preparation : 
Study subjects  will be asked to fast for 12 hours prior to PET scan.  On the 
morning of the PET study, a low carbohydrate meal will be provided to 
study participants.  Patients will be asked to avoid exercise 24 hours prior 
to scanning.   
 
Carotid and Cardiac FDG PET Imaging Technique : 
On the morning of t he scan, Metoprolol 50 – 100 mg PO will be 
administered to slow the heart rate and optim ize the acquisition of 
diastole.1 
 
The dose of FDG administered, duration between FDG injection and PET 
image acquisition, and the method of quantification of FDG uptak e will be 
standardized .15 The injected dose of 18F -fluorodeoxyglucose will be 5.2 
MBq/kg (140 mCi/kg) of lean body mass to a maximum of 12 .5 mCi.  
  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752296], followed by a 5 – [ADDRESS_752297] -mode allowing for both 
single phase and segmented reconstructions.   
 
Subjects will be placed in a head holder and mobility -restricte d with 
padding and tape -reminders. Using ultrasound , performed prior to the 
FDG injection,  the carotid bifurcation will be located and a single -bed 
position high -resolution carotid PET scan will be performed using 3D 
mode with a minimum acquisition time of  9 minutes .21  
 
After a short break, lasting 5 – [ADDRESS_752298] / MR A cquistion:  
All studies will be performed according to rou tine protocol using a 
dedicated PET/CT system, or when available, a dedicated MR/PET.  
These devices are comprised of a PET scanner coupled to either a 
multislice CT or MRI scanner.  With PET/CT, the PET and CT components 
are mounted back -to-back and mecha nically calibrated to ensure 
alignment of the CT and PET planes; the imaging protocol consists of an 
initial CT acquisition followed by [CONTACT_573082].  During 2011, the NIH is 
slated to receive the Siemens Biograph mMR (molecular MR) which is the 
first int egrated MR/PET scanner; this state -of-the-art machine 
incorporates a ring of lutetium oxy -orthosilicate crystal PET detectors 
inside the bore of a 3T MRI magnet and allows for simultaneous MRI and 
PET acquisitions.  
 
CT or MRI scanning will be performed fr om skull base to mid -thighs using 
appropriate respi[INVESTIGATOR_573053].  CT parameters (Biograph, 
Siemens PET/CT) include a spi[INVESTIGATOR_573054] 120 kVp and 115 mA 
with a section thickness of 2.5 mm; no oral or intravenous contrast 
material will be administered for the CT.   The MR acquisition (Verio, 
Seimens) will employ the Total imaging matrix (Tim) coil technology using 
  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752299] parameters with field of view and matrix size adjusted to the 
imaged body part.  
 
High Resolution Carotid MRA : 
In order to facilitate the comparison between MRI and PET imaging prior 
to the availability of the integrated MR/PET unit, an additional high 
resolution carotid MRA examination will be performed at the [ADDRESS_752300] carotid MRA 
study protocol and be scheduled on the same day or within a 2 week 
interval from the PET scan.  Carotid positioning will be reproduced through 
positioning technique using careful measurement, such as the distance 
between the  chin and sternal notch, and employing mobility -restricting 
equipment, like the head holder and tape reminders.  
 
Image Reconstruction and Registration of Carotid and Cardiac FDG PET 
Imaging : 
PET image reconstruction will use standard filters for a fully it erative 
process using optimized spectral content measure with at least [ADDRESS_752301]  256 x 256 matrices; other vascular beds will be 
reconstructed using at minimum the standard 128 x 128 matrices.  
 
Matching PET/CT and MR/PET images will be fused .[ADDRESS_752302] / MR data.  
 
Data Analyses of FDG PET Imaging : 
For each patient scan, quantitative analysi s will be performed of carotid 
and coronary arteries, aortic arch, ascending and descending aorta, 
abdominal aorta and iliac vascular territories.  Arterial wall lesions with 
radioactivity concentrations above the mean blood -pool activity, and/or 
with calc ification detected by [CONTACT_573083] a plaque will be considered plaque and included in the assessment. CT 
/ MR evaluation will be performed to identify atherosclerotic plaque as 
abnormal wall thickening with or without the presence of other features, 
like a lipid core or focal calcification, on a segment by [CONTACT_573084].

16 Maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) corrects for patient weight 
and injected dose -decay:  
 
SUV max (g / ml) = maximum activity (Bq / ml) x weight (kg)   
                          (dose (Bq) x 1000 (g/kg))  
 
Target (plaque) -to-background (blood) ratio (TBR) normalizes vessel wall 
FDG uptake to the circulating FDG concentration.  Once an region of 
interest (ROI) is defined, either an FDG avid plaque o r an FDG negative 
area with plaque features identified on CT or MR, the TBR is derived from 
an mean signal within the ROI divided by [CONTACT_573085] a large 
adjacent vein, typi[INVESTIGATOR_573055].   
 
The target -to-background ratio is calculated:  
 
TBR =            mean vo xel value within ROI (MBq/ml)  
                              mean voxel value within jugular vein ROI (MBq/ml)  
 
MDCT Reproducibility Substudy  
A subgroup of [ADDRESS_752303] angiography performed in a single 
R-R interval (scanning heart rate ≤64 bpm) and estimated radiation 
dosage under 10.[ADDRESS_752304] a ngiography  
will be performed according to the same methods as the baseline imaging 
(pg 10).  Coronary calcium scanning will be omitted to reduce radiation

Participants in the reprodu cibility subset will undergo a total of three CT 
angiography studies over the [ADDRESS_752305] angiogram, scan

was 125 mm3, combining data from both the left and right arterie s. The 
baseline mean for the entire group was 300.0. Since the proposed study 
has a longer duration (24 months) than the NIA Plaque Study, and since 
we have the benefit of improvements in MRI technology, we anticipate a 
larger effect size than was seen in the NIA Plaque Study. The sample size 
calculations were based on finding a 40% decrease in plaque volume in 
the image -guided arm compared to a 20% decrease in the conventional 
treatment arm at [ADDRESS_752322] this difference at the 5% level of significance, 
assuming 80 subjects in each group. These power calculations were 
based on comparing the change from baseline at a single time point. 
However, the primary analysis will employ a mixed model,  which will 
include multiple observations per patient. Therefore, 80 patients in each 
group will certainly provide adequate power. As discussed below we 
assume that the attrition rate will be 0.20 at the 24 -month follow -up. Thus, 
recruiting 200 study parti cipants will be sufficient for this study. These 
calculations were based on the optimal allocation of equal numbers to the 
two arms. However a 3/[ADDRESS_752323] rate, which is assumed to be constant across

in which subjects are entered and then followed until either (a) the terminal 
event occurs, or (b) they drop out of the study, or (c) the study ends and 
the patient is censored while still being actively followed. The stud y design 
calls for an accrual period of [ADDRESS_752324] treatment versus 1.39 years for the image guided 
intervention group.  
 
The power analysis for the secondary ou tcome (clinical events) was based 
on the paper by [CONTACT_174198].24 This paper reported mortality rates at 30 
months in two treatment groups (2/48 = 0.042 and 3/46 = 0.065) and a 
control (10/52 = 0.192). We used these rates, as well as the combination 
for the  two treatment groups (5/94 = 0.053). The calculation of power was 
based on the log -rank test(25) assuming  a [ADDRESS_752325] at the 5% level of significance, we obtained the following 
results.

We assume that the attrition rate will be 0.20 in the 24 -month follow -up. 
Thus, recruiting 200 study participants with 160 anticipated to complete 24 
months of follow -up will be sufficient for this study.  
 
 
 
Data Analysis:  
 
1. The intent -to-treat and missing data : 
 
The intent -to-treat (ITT) approach will be used for the primary analysis. 
According t o this generally recommended approach, comparisons are 
made according to randomized treatment assignment, regardless of any 
changes in dose, schedule or treatment arm. In an ITT analysis, all 
randomized study participants are included in their assigned tre atment 
groups, regardless of compliance with the assigned treatment regimen. 
On the other hand, the weakness of ITT is that it assesses the effect of 
treatment for subjects known not to have used the treatment enough to 
have any effect. While conventional ITT will be the method used to 
analyze and report the primary results, in order to derive valid estimates of 
  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752326] a ssumed a dropout rate of 20%, since we 
anticipate a lower dropout rate than the 25% in the previous trial.  This is 
because we are using three scans over two years rather than four over [ADDRESS_752327] of the dropouts in 
the previous study were due to problems with niacin flushing, which again 
will not be a problem in the prese nt study.  
 
2. Multiple outcome measures : 
 
In this clinical trial, we will evaluate multiple outcome measures: changes 
in plaque architecture and composition measured by [CONTACT_9268], and time to 
events, including the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
outcomes and disease -specific death. The f ollowing approaches to 
evaluate multiple outcome measures will be implemented: (i) defining a 
primary outcome measure; (ii) correcting for multiple testing, such as 
Bonferroni adjustment; (iii) with data on major clinical events, adopting a 
combined endpoi nt, such as time to first cardiovascular event or death, 
whichever occurs first.  
 
3. Data Analysis : 
  
Standard statistical methods(24) will be used to describe the demographic 
characteristics, clinical manifestations and basic summary statistics as 
rates or means (medians). Confidence intervals will also be computed. If 
necessary, permutation methods (26) will be employed.    
 
For Hypotheses 1, 2, and 4 :  
 
Linear mixed (random -effects) models(27) will be used to study differential 
changes over time in plaque size and composition  and drug dosage  
between the two treatments. Each model will include main effects of time 
from baseline and treatment, with interactions tested separately. To 
decide on the correlation structure for these models, variation due to 
random effects, serial correlation and mea surement error will be examined 
using the variogram. These models will also be used to isolate specific 
comparisons of outcome variables at specific time points between the two 
arms.  The required assumptions of normally distributed errors and 
random effec ts can be checked by [CONTACT_573091], 
which are now available for the mixed model. In the event that the 
assumptions are not satisfied, usually because of skewed error 
distributions, data transformations from the Box -Cox power family will be 
considered.  The most commonly used member of this family is the 
logarithmic transformation, which usually corrects a problem with right 
skewness.  
 
  Version Date:   10/26/17 
28 For Hypothesis 3 :  
 
For the time -to-event data, both the Kaplan -Meier estimate and the Cox 
proporti onal hazards model will be employed.  The primary analysis will 
compare the two treatments using a log -rank test.  Secondary analyses 
will use the Cox model to include adjustment for covariates.  A non -
parametric proportional hazards model will also be use d to explore 
possible transformations of independent variables in the models(28). 
 
For Hypothesis 5, 6, and 7:  
 
Using appropriate parametric and non -parametric tests at and between 
both the baseline and [ADDRESS_752328] / MRI will be 
performed.  FDG accumulation (with both TBR and SU Vmax) will be 
compared across different plaque morphology and compositions defined 
by [CONTACT_66243] / CT (for example, presence of a lipid core or calcification).  
Correlation between imaging findings and changes will be made with age, 
gender, traditional risk factors (height, weight, hypertension, etc.), 
absolute values and changes in statin dose, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, 
triglycerides and hematological biomarkers markers of inflammation, 
thrombosis and atheroprotection.  
 
For Hypothesis 8:  
Agreement between  the two blinded readers of semiquantitative measures 
of CT angiographic stenosis will be measured using weighted kappa.  
Quantitative analyses of coronary arterial wall volume, lumen volume and 
plaque composition will be assessed using the intraclass corr elation 
coefficient (ICC) and Bland -Altman plots.

consequent to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis and concomitant 
cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death in all major 
racial/ethnic subgroups in industrialized nations, Effort s to reduce the 
burden of cardiovascular disease is powerfully relevant to persons of 
all ethnicities.  Our planned enrollment has been selected to be 
representative of the general gender and ethnic demographic 
subgroups of the greater Washington DC area ( appendix F).  The 
advent of MRI techniques powerful enough to allow for precise 
quantification of plaque growth and regression, as well as alterations of 
plaque architecture and composition, has made available a number of 
novel indices of atherosclerotic b urden and plaque vulnerability. This 
study is designed to investigate the comparative effectiveness of 
image guided lipid therapy with standard NCEP guided therapy with 
HMG -CoA reductase agents on the progression of carotid and 
coronary atherosclerosis as sub-clinical markers of cardiovascular 
atherosclerotic disease.  
 
PET Substudy  
 
A subgroup of [ADDRESS_752332] scan will be 
asked to return 4 weeks after their initial scan for a second scan using 
the same protocol.  The inclusion criteria for this substudy -- single 
heartbeat (one RR interval) scan with <10.5 mSv  estimated dosage --
are selected to keep  radiation exposure  as low as can be achieved 
while assessing the reproducibility limits of this method .  Additionally, 
the protocol indicated and reproducibility scans will cumulatively 
administer less than the 21 mSv radiation dosage specified in th e 
consent document.  P atients will not undergo calcium scanning during 
the reproducibility scan and they will not be eligible for the PET 
substudy .   Sixteen to twenty -four patients will be selected from three 
groups: (a)  patients with a calcium score of  0-99, (b) patients  with a 
calcium score -100-399 and (c) patients  with a calcium score of >  400.  
These 60 scans will be interpreted by [CONTACT_340688], allowing 
assessment of both intra and  interobserver variability as well as 
repeatability limits.

Statin Therapy  
 
HMG CoA -Reductase inhibitors (statins) are generally well tolerated.    
Clinically important adverse effects of the drugs include increases in 
serum transaminase concentrations and myositis, with and without 
complicating rhabdomyolysis. (29)  Statin monotherapy can result in 
elevation of liver enzymes, most often ≤3 times the upper limit of 
normal.  Thes e elevations typi[INVESTIGATOR_573058].  Their clinical significance is 
uncertain given the extremely rare occurrence of statin related toxic 
hepatits(16).  
 
In 7 studies to date reporting rates of clini cal myositis, elevation of 
creatinine kinase (CK) > 10 times the upper limit of normal and 
rhabdomyolysis, the combined incidence of these events has been 
less than 0.7 %(10, 31-35).The highest reported rate of rhabdomyolysis 
was 0.53%, observed with simvastatin 80 mg daily . (36) 
 
The use of high dose, intensive statin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_573059] a recent development. Available data, including three 
large randomized controlled trials (the A to Z,  TNT and IDEAL 
studies), indicate that high -dose statins (atorvastatin 80 mg daily, 
simvastatin 80 mg daily) are associated with low rates of serious 
musculoskeletal (<0.6%) and hepatic (<1.3%) injury.  (33, 34, 36, 37) 
 
Ionizing Radiation  
 
Low dose CTA angiography and FDG PET/CT (as used in this 
protocol) carries a conservatively estimated lifetime additional risk of 
malignancy less than 0.2% in women and less than 0.1% in men, on a 
background lifetime risk of app roximately 30%.38-40The primary 
prevention population targeted for this study is unlikely to receive

considered to be safe, with an extremely rare incidence of idiopathic 
allergic reactions.  Use in a population with severe (stage 4 to 5) renal 
dysfunction is the exception to this rule.  Patients with severe or end -
stage renal impair ment and concomitant gadolinium chelate exposure 
are at risk for development of the fibrosing disorder nephrogenic 
fibrosing dermopathy (NSF), with 2.5 -5% of patients  with end -stage 
renal disease on dialysis  developi[INVESTIGATOR_573060] e.  The FDA currently defines the at -risk population as patients 
with estimated GFR <30 mL/min /m2 or those with any degree of renal 
dysfunction due to the hepatorenal syndrome or peri -hepatic transplant

function 
(http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Ne wsroom/PressAnnouncements/200
7/ucm108919.htm ).  To ensure participant safety and provide a wide 
safety margin, participants with estimated GFR < 45 mL/min/m2 will be 
ineligible for gadolinium chelate contrast administration during this 
study.[ADDRESS_752335] induced nephropathy

F-18 Fluorodeoxygluco se 
 
F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an analog of glucose with an 
excellent safety record. In a four year multicenter study of 81,[ADDRESS_752337] of the [LOCATION_002] PET facilities, 
not a single adverse reaction was detected w ith 95% confidence limits 
from 0 -3.7/100,000.44 This finding is consistent with observations made 
across all  radiopharmaceuticals. In a prospective study of over 
750,000 administrations in 18 major [LOCATION_002] medical centers the 
prevalence of reactions was 2.3/100,000 with 95% confidence limits of 
1.2-3.4/100,000.46 
7.4 Risks/Benefits Analysis  
The principal risks to participants are intensive statin therapy, exposure 
to ionizing radiation as part of the coronary CT angiogram, receipt of 
iodinated contrast and receipt of gadolinium based contrast.  As noted 
in 7.3, above, large clinical trials ha ve demonstrated low rates of 
significant adverse events due to statins, few if any of which persist 
after drug discontinuation.  The study population has been specifically 
selected to be at the lowest risk for ionizing radiation, and the CT 
protocol carefu lly tailored to ensure delivery of the lowest possible 
dosage necessary to generate diagnostic images.  The limitation of 
enrollment to patients with GFR > renders the risk of iodinated and 
gadolinium based contrast negligible.  
 
The level of risk to the re search participants  was initially determined to 
be greater than minimal risk ( 45 CFR 46 102 ). As of January 2017, the 
study status of this protocol changed to “data analysis only” and the 
level of risk of this study is now minimal.   
 
This research involves  the prospect of direct benefit to individual 
subjects through potential identification of clinically silent 
atherosclerotic disease and according intensification of statin therapy 
that would not otherwise be indicated in usual clinical care.  This 
carries  the likelihood of significant reduction (16 -21% relative risk 
reduction) of the risk of clinical cardiovascular events.47

9.0 Multi -Institutional Guidelines: N/A  
10.0 Pharmaceutical Information  
Beta Blocker (Package insert) Clinical Pharmacology information:  
Lopressor is a beta -adrenergic receptor blocking agent. In vitro and in 
vivo animal studies have shown that it has a preferential effect on 
beta1 adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in cardiac muscle. This 
preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher doses, 
Lopressor also in hibits beta [ADDRESS_752347] confirmed the beta -blocking 
activity of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate 
and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic 
blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol -induced 
tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.  
  
Relative beta1 selectivity has been confirmed by [CONTACT_716]: (1) In 
normal  subjects, Lopressor is unable to reverse the beta2  -mediated 
vasodilating effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. This contrasts with the effect of 
nonselective (beta1 plus beta2) beta blockers, which completely 
reverse the vasodilating effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. (2) In ast hmatic 
patients, Lopressor reduces FEV1 and FVC significantly less than a 
nonselective beta blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta1 -receptor 
blocking doses.  
  
Lopressor has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane -
stabilizing activity is detec table only at doses much greater than 
required for beta blockade. Lopressor crosses the blood -brain barrier 
  Version Date:   10/26/17 
39 and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the 
simultaneous plasma concentration. Animal and human experiments 
indicate that Lopress or slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal 
conduction.  
 
In controlled clinical studies, Lopressor has been shown to be an 
effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant 
therapy with thiazide -type diuretics, at dosages of [ADDRESS_752348] 
been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at 
peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to 
decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading to reduced 
sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin 
activity.  
 
By [CONTACT_573095] -induced increases in heart rate, in velocity 
and extent of myocardial contraction, and  in blood pressure, Lopressor 
reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of 
effort, thus making it useful in the long -term management of angina 
pectoris. However, in patients with heart failure, beta -adrenergic 
blockade may increase ox ygen requirements by [CONTACT_573096] -diastolic pressure.  
 
Although beta -adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in the treatment 
of angina and hypertension, there are situations in which sympathetic 
stimulation is vital. In patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate 
ventricular function may depend on sympathetic drive. In the presence 
of AV block, beta blockade may prevent the necessary facilitating 
effect of sympathetic activity on conduction. Beta2 -adrenergic 
blockade results in passive bronchial constriction by [CONTACT_573097].  
 
In controlled clinical trials, Lopresso r, administered two or four times 
daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing 
the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The 
dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 -400 mg daily. A 
controlled, comparative,  clinical trial showed that Lopressor was 
indistinguishable from propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris.  
  Version Date:   10/26/17 
40 In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double -blind, placebo -
controlled clinical study, Lopressor was shown to reduce 3 -month 
mortality by 36 % in patients with suspected or definite myocardial 
infarction.  
 
Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their 
arrival in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], once their clinical condition had stabilized and 
their hemodynamic status had been carefully eva luated. Subjects were 
ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of 
shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive 
heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by [CONTACT_573098], given in a coronary care or 
comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with Lopressor or placebo 
was then continued for 3  months. After this double -blind period, all 
patients were given Lopressor and followed up to 1 year.  
 
The median delay  from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of 
therapy was 8 hours in both the Lopressor - and placebo -treatment 
groups. Among patients treated with Lopressor, there were 
comparable reductions in 3 -month mortality for those treated early (≤8 
hours) and th ose in whom treatment was started later. Significant 
reductions in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain 
following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with Lopressor 
and were independent of the interval between onset of sym ptoms and 
initiation of therapy.  
 
The precise mechanism of action of Lopressor in patients with 
suspected or definite myocardial infarction is not known.  
 
In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both 
very early (intra -venously) a nd during a subsequent [ADDRESS_752349] (Package Inser t) isovue  (iopamidol )  injection, solution    
  Version Date:   10/26/[ADDRESS_752350] medium, permitting 
radiographic visualization of the internal structures of the human body 
until significant hemodilution occurs.  
 
Following intravascular injection, radiopaque diagnostic agents are 
immediately diluted in the circulating plasma. Calculations of apparent 
volume of distribution at steady -state indicate that iopamidol is 
distribute d between the circulating blood volume and other 
extracellular fluid; there appears to be no significant deposition of 
iopamidol in tissues. Uniform distribution of iopamidol in extracellular 
fluid is reflected by [CONTACT_573099].  
 
The pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered iopamidol in 
normal subjects conform to an open two -compartment model with first 
order elimination (a rapi d alpha phase for drug distribution and a slow 
beta phase for drug elimination). The elimination serum or plasma half -
life is approximately two hours; the half -life is not dose dependent. No 
significant metabolism, deiodination, or biotransformation occurs . 
 
Iopamidol is excreted mainly through the kidneys following 
intravascular administration. In patients with impaired renal function, 
the elimination half -life is prolonged dependent upon the degree of 
impairment. In the absence of renal dysfunction, the c umulative urinary 
excretion for Iopamidol, expressed as a percentage of administered 
intravenous dose is approximately [ADDRESS_752351] ays little tendency to bind to serum or plasma proteins.  
 
No evidence of in vivo complement activation has been found in 
normal subjects.  
*Animal studies indicate that iopamidol does not cross the blood -brain 
barrier to any significant extent following int ravascular administration.  
  Version Date:   10/26/17 
42 *ISOVUE (lopamidol Injection) enhances computed tomographic brain 
imaging through augmentation of radiographic efficiency. The degree 
of enhancement of visualization of tissue density is directly related to 
the iodine content in an administered dose; peak iodine blood levels 
occur immediately following rapid injection of the dose. These levels 
fall rapi[INVESTIGATOR_573063]. This can be accounted for by [CONTACT_573100]. Equilibration with 
the extracellular compartments is reached in about ten minutes, 
thereafter the fall becomes exponential. Maximum contrast 
enhancement frequently occurs after peak blood iodine leve ls are 
reached. The delay in maximum contrast enhancement can range from 
five to forty minutes depending on the peak iodine levels achieved and 
the cell type of the lesion. This lag suggests that radiographic contrast 
enhancement is at least in part depend ent on the accumulation of 
iodine within the lesion and outside the blood pool, although the 
mechanism by [CONTACT_573101]. The radiographic 
enhancement of nontumoral lesions, such as arteriovenous 
malformations and aneurysms, is probably dep endent on the iodine 
content of the circulating blood pool.  
 
In CECT head imaging, ISOVUE (lopamidol Injection) does not 
accumulate in normal brain tissue due to the presence of the blood -
brain barrier. The increase in x -ray absorption in normal brain is d ue to 
the presence of contrast agent within the blood pool. A break in the 
blood -brain barrier such as occurs in malignant tumors of the brain 
allows the accumulation of the contrast medium within the interstitial 
tissue of the tumor. Adjacent normal brain  tissue does not contain the 
contrast medium.  
 
In nonneural tissues (during computed tomography of the body), 
iopamidol diffuses rapi[INVESTIGATOR_573064]. Increase in x -ray absorption is related to blood flow, 
concentration of  the contrast medium, and extraction of the contrast 
medium by [CONTACT_573102]. Contrast 
enhancement is thus due to the relative differences in extravascular 
diffusion between normal and abnormal tissue, quite differen t from that 
in the brain.  
 
The pharmacokinetics of iopamidol in both normal and abnormal tissue 
have been shown to be variable. Contrast enhancement appears to be 
greatest soon after administration of the contrast medium, and 
following intraarterial rather  than intravenous administration. Thus, 
greatest enhancement can be detected by a series of consecutive two - 
to three -second scans performed just after injection (within 30 to 90 
seconds), i.e., dynamic computed tomographic imaging.

Corrections to protocol amendment  
1- Previous amendm ent about a dditional collection for surgical data on data collection sheet:  
Ultrasound  record and  image  of fascial plain blocks (SAP and PECS) was tracked on an older 
version of protocol in error and submitted on 10/23/2020. This amendment is to correct this 
error.  
Additional amendment to this protocol  
1- Twelve patients’ surgery type was planned to be a minimally invasive surgery, however after t he 
randomization, their surgery type has been converted to a sternotomy during their surgery. 
Because of this, these patients were not qualified for the study and their follow -ups couldn’t be 
completed.   To be able to keep the power of the study, we would like to add 12 more patients to 
our total enrollment number which was 196 before. Adding 12  more patients, 208 is proposed to 
be the total number.   
Version 5: November 3 , 2021  
- We would like to add more patients per our statistical team suggestion to increase the power. 
Our total number approximately will be 214.  (page 13)  
Version 6: July 6, 2022  
- The primary analysis method was revised  due to non -normality of primary outcome  from “We 
will report model based P -value and the difference in mean OBAS scores along with confidence 
intervals. ”  as “Due to non -normality of OBAS score, it will be log -transformed for analysis. We 
will report model based P -value and the geometric mean ratio for OBAS scores along with 
confidence intervals.  ”  
- The smallest clinically important difference of 2 point reduction in O BAS score was corre cted as 
20% reduction in geometric means.  
- One inclusion criteria was more clearly stated as “Elective MICS for isolated robotically -assisted 
mitral valve repair via anterolateral thoracotomy approach.  “  
- Sample size was mor e clearly stated for consistency.

Version 5.0: November 3, [ADDRESS_368311] several  decades the popularity of  minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) 
increased consequent to  advance s in imaging, instrumentation , and surgical skills.1,2 An increase 
in the age -related prevalence of the valvular heart disease3 also prompted novel  surgical 
approaches.4 In addition to  non-inferior operative mortality, the intermediate and long -term 
survival results  are comparable to the traditional  median sternotomy approach for both mitral5-
10 and aortic valve11-14 procedure s. The reported advantages are  also seen in terms of decreased 
infection rate, short er time to extubation and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], decreased postoperative 
bleeding and transfusion rate , improved cosmesis, better postoperative respi[INVESTIGATOR_301516]’s satisfaction .5-7,15,16  
Both mitral and aortic valve repairs  or replacements can be performed using right 
thoracotom ies.2,4 A medial ( anterior, parasternal; 3rd intercostal space) incision including  rib 
disarticulation is oft en needed for the aortic valve s (AV) , whereas a more lateral (inframammary , 
mid-axillary line ; 4th intercostal space) incision is needed for  mitral valve s (MV).  Robotically 
assisted MV repair is performed via slightly smaller thorac otomy and 3 additional stab incisions 
5 
 
Version 5.0: November 3, 2021  
 
 for the robotic instruments. Port-access ed robotically assisted surgery avoids thoracotomy 
incision and totally depen ds on the percutaneous approach .1,4  
Pain following  thoracoto my is a serious complication which may delay patients’ recovery, 
prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298] , and increase morbidity and mortality ,17 — all of which impair  recovery 
through the post -operative day  3.[ADDRESS_368312] sternotomy , patients with “J” 
hemisternotomy for both MV and AV procedures had better postoperative pain control, but only 
30%  (compared to 20% in the sternotomy group)  were pain -free in the first 24 hours.6,15 
Furthermore, the reports of the MICS for MV using right thoracotomy approach showed no 
difference in visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and simi lar amount of additional  analgesics 
used compared to the standard approach .20,[ADDRESS_368313] blocks (PECS I and II blocks) as an analgesia technique for surgeries of the ante rior 
and anterolateral chest wall.31,32 The blocks showed a reliable but limited sensory coverage to 
the antero -lateral  T2-T4 (with variable spread to T6) with  interfascial plane injection of the local 
anesthetic . In order to achieve more caudad and postero -lateral  sensory coverage, a  serratus 
anterior plane (SAP) block was introduced showing dermatomal coverage in T2 -T7 with a variable 
spread  to T9.[ADDRESS_368314] adjacent to the long thoracic as 
well as lateral cutaneous  braches of the intercostal nerves.34 Indeed, inadequate  nociceptive 
block of those nerves  may be why analgesia control after thoracic surgery is often unsatisfactory 
with traditional regional analgesia techniques.34,35 The posterior cutaneous branches may not be 
directly blocked , but  the clinical eff icacy of the PECS and SAP blocks is not diminished , probably 
because the local anesthetic spreads  retrograde ly.34,36 Because of the unique anatomical

Version 5.0: November 3, [ADDRESS_368315] precautions.38 Indeed, compared to 
the intercostal, interpleural , or paravertebral techniques , pain control was achieved with much 
smaller LA doses which suggests that there  was less intravascular absorption. Under the 
ultrasound guidance , the blocks can be easily to perform  with the patients  asleep , thus  avoiding 
discomfort and multiple injections.   
Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel ; bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301517], Pacira 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany,  NJ [LOCATION_003] ) is a prolonged -release formulation of the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301518] a single -shot infiltration of the surgical site. The advantage of the prolonged -release  
formulation  is analgesi a lasting  up to 72  h which should improve  analgesia after MICS. In a small 
retrospective study of robotically  assisted cardiac endoscopic procedures,  comparing incisional 
infiltration with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301519] , Balkhy et al. demonstrated lower pain  
scores, reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], and less postoperative nausea and vomiting  — although 
none of the difference s were statistically significant.[ADDRESS_368316] (TAP) block  which is similar  to PECS and SAP blocks.[ADDRESS_368317] yet to be reported .

postoperative days and  compromi ses respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806] . PECS and SAP blocks with l iposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301520] d respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806] .   
 
Aims of the study  
 
Our primary aim is to determine whether a PECS /SAP block , using a mixture of 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301521], provide s superior recovery  compared to routine 
parenteral and enteral analgesia in patients recovering from MICS.  Our primary outcome will be 
the simple multi -dimensional quality assessment , Overall Benefit Analgesia Score  (OBAS score).53  
 
  Our secondary aim s are to:  1) compare  cumulative postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] 
(pain medications administered over one-day periods quantified as morphine equivalents and 
provided by [CONTACT_301559]  1, 2, and 3 ; 2) evaluate 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_104899] ( forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_301522] ( FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC)  
and peak flow ) after extubation on the postoperative days  1, 2 and 3  while patients remain 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301523] : 
PECS /SAP blocks  with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301524]  1, 2, and 3 . A 20% reduction in 
OBAS geometric mean , a-priori , was defined as minimal clinically important diffe rence . 
Secondary hypothes es:  
(1) PECS /SAP block s decrease postoperative cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_301525] . 
(2) PECS/SAP blocks improve  pulmonary mechanics , on each of the postoperative 
days 1, 2 and 3, from  the baseline .  
 
 
Exploratory Hypothesis:  
(1) PECS/SAP blocks improve the Quality -of-Recovery score averaged over the 
postoperative days 1 and 3, with a difference of 8 points being considered the 
minimum clinically important difference.54 
(2) PECSII and SAP blocks reduce  persistent postoperative surgical pain

15. Previous participation in this study . 
16. eGFR <[ADDRESS_368320] a day before surgery. Patients will be randomized the 
day of surgery upon presentation to the operating room to either a treatment group  (PECS/ SAP 
blocks) or a control group (standard parenteral analgesia technique with or  without incisional LA 
infiltration) using secure web -based randomization . Randomization  will be stratified by [CONTACT_301560], with random blocking in each case.  The system will be accessed shortly 
9 
 
Version 5.0: November 3, [ADDRESS_368321] ASA monitors and may include the use of arterial or 
central venous pressure monitoring, trans -esophageal echocardiography, and lung isolation 
using a bronchial blocker or a double lumen endotracheal tube.  Medication administration for 
induction and maintenance of anesthesia will also be consistent with usual care and will include 
intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_301527]. Intravenous lidocaine will not be 
admi nistered upon induction of anesthesia.   
Pressure -control ventilation will be used with a tidal volume not exceeding 6 -10 ml/kg 
ideal body weight during two - and one -lung ventilation. Fluids will be  managed conservatively  
per routine .  Patients not extubat ed at the end of the procedure will be sedated with propofol. 
Surgical procedures with the assistance of the cardio -pulmonary by[CONTACT_301561]. The  general  approach for the AV replacement will be via the right  anterior 
thoraco tomy  in the 3rd intercostal space .4 The MV repair/replacement procedures will be 
approached via the right lateral thoracotomy inframammary  incision in the 4th intercostal space  
in the mid -axillary line and augmented, as needed, with the stab incisions for the robotic ports.[ADDRESS_368322] of the blocks as used for MICS procedures at our institution. The 
patients randomized to the “blocks” will receive PECS II and serratus anterio r for the MVR 
requiring  antero -lateral thoracotomy and port incisions. The PECS/serratus blocks will be 
performed with the patient under the general anesthesia before incision. If proves impossible to 
perform blocks preoperatively because of  surgical urgency, the y will be done at end of surgery.  
PECS II blocks : 
Patient s will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and  prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. An 
ultrasound probe will be placed just below the clavicle in the mid -clavicular line.  
For the PECS II block, the probe will be scanned infe riorly and laterally until the plane 
between the pectoralis minor and serratus muscle is identified. The serratus muscle can be 
clearly seen coursing over the ribs, while the intercostal muscles are seen in the interspaces 
between the ribs.  Once the plane  is identified the needle is again adv anced in an “in -plane” 
fashion.  Once the needle location is confirmed by [CONTACT_301562] -dissection, a 20 -30 ml of 
local anesthetic solution is administered into the space.   
10 
 
Version 5.0: November 3, [ADDRESS_368323] block:  
With the patient in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], a will be  placed under the operative side to achieve 
a slightly lateral tilt. The arm is abducted to expose the costal margin. The patient is prepped and 
draped in a sterile fashion. The positioning and preppi[INVESTIGATOR_301528] t he PECS block to 
avoid repositioning if both blocks are being performed. The ultrasound probe is scanned laterally 
from the pectoralis to the axillary region at approximately the level of the 4th rib. The plane 
between the serratus muscle and the latissimus dorsi muscle is identified and the needle 
advanced in an “in -plane” fashion until the tip is between the muscles (superficial SAP block). A 
small bolus of 0.[ADDRESS_368324]. As these are field blocks, adequate volume of 
infiltration is  important in achieving optimal analgesia.  If proves impossible to perform as 
superficial SAP block, it will be given  between the posterior border of the Serratus anterior 
muscle and the corresponding surface of the rib ( deep SAP block ). 
Local anesthetic:  
The local anesthetic  used for the blocks will be a 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301529] a dose not to 
exceed 2.5  mg/kg. The local anesthetic  solution can be diluted for smaller patients to allow for 
appropriate volume of injection. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_301530] 12 hours 
after infiltration.55 Patients will therefore also be given  liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  (Exparel , Pacira 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  San Diego, CA ) in a dose of 266  mg in 20 ml can be safely combined with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301531] a ratio not exceeding 2:1, but cannot be combined with other local 
anesthetics due to the concern of rapid release of encapsulated bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301532].56  
Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301533] -based and the full 266 -mg bottle can be 
administered to adult thoracic patients . A maximum of 150  mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301534]. This equates to one 30-mL bottle of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301535] (2) bottles of 
0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] . If a higher volume of the local anesthetic  is needed a 10 ml of normal 
saline can be added to the mixture of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301536]. Thus patients 
≥60 kg will receive 150 mg of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301537], while patients  weigh ing <[ADDRESS_368325] analgesia technique will be given parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] 
(such as fentanyl or hydromorphone) until they are converted to the enteral medications  such as  
Percocet .   
Study Measurements  
Patent demographics will be collected from preoperative inte rviews and chart review 
(Table  1). Cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], and length of stay will be 
11 
 
Version 5.0: November 3, 2021  
 
 captured electronica lly using Epic and/or PHDS. Other secondary and descriptive outcome data 
as well as surgical and intraoperative data will be collected prospectively (Table 2 ). 
Data will be obtained from the following sources: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) 
databas e, Cardiovascular Information Registry (CVIR) of the Heart and Vascular Center at the 
Cleveland Clinic, the electronic medical record (EPIC), and the electronic Anesthesia Record 
Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_26102] (ARKS).   
a) OBAS score  
The OBAS score questionnaire (Table 3 ) will be obtained and score calculated  by [CONTACT_301563] -operative days 1-3. We will calculate the average of the OBAS scores obtained. The 
OBAS score is a validated postoperatively calculated, multi -dimensional questionnaire that 
consists of 7 ite ms (Table 3) encompassing not only scale -rated pain score but different aspects 
of analgesia benefits, side effects and overall patient’s satisfaction.53  
The OBAS score is based  on 7 questions and ranges from 0 to 28 points that will b e 
administered on POD 1 – POD 3 . Although these are longitudinal ordinal data, we will be able to 
treat OBAS scores as continuous data in the analyses with the lower score correlating with better 
resolution of the analgesia treatment. A 20% reduction in OBAS geometric mean , a-priori , was 
defined as minimal clinically important difference ..57,58  
b) Pain assessments  
Pain scores  on a 0 -10 verbal response scale will be evaluated, per routine , by [CONTACT_301564][INVESTIGATOR_057]. Pain scores (0 -10) will be recorded along 
with the OBAS measurements at rest and then after provocation in the form of a vigorous 
cough ing.  
Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_301538] 1, 2, and 3 totals  
will be collected and converted to milligram morphine equivalents ( Table 4 ).  Patients will not be 
given opi[INVESTIGATOR_301539].   
c) FEV 1, FVC and peak flow   
FEV 1, FVC and peak flow  will be recorded preoperatively at baseline and at bedside, on the 
first postoperative mornings 1, 2 and 3 . The FEV 1, FVC and peak flows will be measured using 
Easy on -PC Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] S ystem (ndd Medical, Andover MA) with the patient in the sitting position. 
The measurements and will be obtained by [CONTACT_301565] . The average of three tests will be considered to be  the final result.  
d) Quality -of-Recovery -15 (QoR -15) score   
12 
 
Version 5.0: November 3, 2021  
 
 The QoR -15 is a quality of recovery score that provides a patient -centered global measure of  
overall health status after surgery and anesthesia. It comprises 15-item questionnaire with range 
of responses  from 0-150 (http://links.lww.com/AL N/B274 ). The patients will be given a 
question naire  on the first  and the third  postoperative days, the response collected and the 
difference from the previous days calculated. Myles et al. reported a minimal clinically important 
difference in the QoR -15 score  of 8 which wil l be used in this study.54  
e) Pharmacokinetic (PK) Sample Collection  
Blood samples (4 mL each) will be collected from 16 subjects from the treatment group in order 
to determine p harmacokinetic parameters of  liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. These samples will be 
collected  at the following time stamps after the injection of the liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301540]/SAP blocks: 15±5 min, 30±5 min, 1h±5 min, 4h±10 min, 24h±20 min, 32h±20 min, 40h±20 
min,  48h±20 min, 72h±20 min, 84h±20. The samples will be obtained from a dedicat ed IV line in 
a separate location or from an arterial line.  
The Blood samples will be collected into K2EDTA tubes and will be centrifuged at 1000 to 1200g 
for 10 min to obtain plasma within 1 hour of collection. After centrifugation, the plasma will be 
transferred into polypropylene tubes. The plasma samples will be stored frozen at -20°C or colder 
until shipment. All s amples will be shipped frozen with  dry ice to ABS Laboratories, Inc. The 
shipment address is as follows: [CONTACT_301571] V. Doig ABS Laboratories, Ltd. [ADDRESS_368326] 
York, YO10 4DZ, [LOCATION_006]  
 
Descriptive and Safety Outcomes  
a) Total ICU length of stay; 
b) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]; 
c) Cum ulative non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_301541], ketorolac, ibuprofen, gabapentin, 
and pregabalin will be recorded and compared  over the initial three postoperative days ;  
d) Anxiolytics such as alprazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam will be recorded and compared . 
 
Statistical analysis  
We will compare groups on potentially confounding demographic and preoperative risk factors 
listed in Table 1 using appropriate summary statistics (i.e., mean ± standard deviation, median 
[Q1, Q3], or N (%) as appropriate) as well as surgical and intraoper ative data will be collected 
prospectively (Table 2). Randomized groups will be compared on balance on these characteristics 
using absolute standardized difference, defined as the absolute difference in means, mean ranks, 
or proportions divided by [CONTACT_301566].  
Analyses will be modified intent -to-treat, including all randomized patients who received 
PECSII/serratus blocks (regardless of whether it’s consistent with the randomization).  
13 
 
Version 5.0: November 3, 2021  
 
  
We will summarize descriptive and safety outcomes by [CONTACT_301567] (i.e., mean ± standard deviation, median [Q1, Q3], or N (%) as appropriate). 
No statistical tests will be performed on these outcomes.  
We will use an alpha of 0.05 for both the primary and secondary an alyses, with a significance 
criterion of 0.05 for the primary analysis and 0.0167 for each secondary analysis (i.e., 0.05/3, 
Bonferroni correction). Analyses will be completed using SAS version 9.4 or newer (SAS Institute, 
Carey, North Carolina) or R versi on 3.2.4 or newer (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria).  
 
Primary analysis  
 
We will estimate the PECS/SAP blocks effect on OBAS scores using a repeated measures linear 
regression model with an autoregressive correlation structure, adjustin g for  ALL imbalanced 
confounders  (if any) .  Based on these model we would be able to claim if the PECS/SAP blocks  
had any effect on the OBAS score  compared to standard routine analgesia during any of the 
postoperative time up to third postoperative day.  Due to non -normality of OBAS score, it will be 
log-transformed  for analysis . We will report model based P -value and the geometric mean ratio 
for OBAS scores along with confidence intervals.  To assess whether the  PECS/SAP blocks  effect 
is heterogeneous over three postop days , we will assess the treatment -by-time interaction using 
a significance criterion of 0.20. If it appears that the treatment effect is heterogeneous, we will 
report the treatment effect separately for each posto perative day POD 1, POD [ADDRESS_368327] ion as appropriate (e.g., 0.05/3 ; 3 postoperative days).  
 
Secondary Analysis  
 
Morphine equivalents will be calculated based on the conversions specified in Table 4 below . 
Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_301542] 1, 2, and 3 totals will 
be collected and converted to milligram morphine equivalents.  Patients will not be provided 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_301543].

imbalanced baseline or surgical chara cteristics between groups.  
To assess whether the  effect of PECS/SAP blocks  is heterogeneous over time, we will assess the 
treatment -by-time interaction using a significance criterion of 0.20. If it appears that the 
treatment effect is heterogeneous, we wi ll report the treatment effect separately for each 
postoperative day using a Bonferroni correction as appropriate (e.g., 0.05/ 3; 3 postoperative 
days).

Version 5.0: November 3, [ADDRESS_368329] of PECS/SAP blocks on FEV 1 ,  FVC and peak flow rate using  three  
separate repeated measures regression models with an autoregressive correlation structure, 
adjusting for baseline FEV 1 ,  FVC , peak flow rate and imbalanced confounders  (if any) .   
The Wald tests for regression model coefficients will be used to test eac h of the secondary 
hypotheses; the Bonferroni correction for four outcomes will be employed to control the overall 
Type I error rate at 0.05 for the secondary outcomes.  
 
Exploratory Analysis  
Two separate linear regression models will be developed to assess  the relationship between 
analgesia strategy and each of the two exploratory outcomes (quality of recovery after 
anesthesia survey and persistent postoperative surgical pain).  To compare patients from two 
groups on these outcomes mean difference will be r eported along with 95% confidence intervals.   
 
Descriptive and Safety Analyses  
We will summarize descriptive and safety outcomes by [CONTACT_301567] (i.e., mean ± standard deviation, median [Q1, Q3], or N (%) as appro priate). 
No statistical tests will be performed on these outcomes.  
 
 
Sample Size Considerations  
Per Mamoun , observed a coefficient of variation (CV) of 53% in the placebo group of cardiac 
surgery patients .59 We assumed a slightly more conservative CV of 50% and that the treatment 
effect favored PECS /SAP blocks by 20% (i.e., true ratio of geometric means of 0.80). We will need 
to enroll approximately 192 patients ( 96 per group) to have 90% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_368330] superiority of PECS/SAP blocks to  standard  routin e parental and enteral analgesia 
in patients recovering from MICS .  
 
We also plan for two interim analyses at 1/3 and 2/3 of the planned enrollment  to assess safety, 
feasibility and formal efficacy and futility. T herefore, interim adjusted sample size is N=98 
patients per group, or N=196 total.  We will use the conservative gamma spending function with 
parameters -5 and -5 for alpha (efficacy) and beta (futility), respectively.  If the alternative 
hypothesis is true  (the treatment effect exists)  there will  be a cumulative probability of 10%, 53%  
and 100% of crossing either an efficacy or futility boundary at the 1st , 2d  and final analyses, 
respectively (Table A and Figure 1 below contains boundary Information). Planned first  and 
second interim  analyses wil l be performed upon accrual of 66 and 132 patients  respectively . 
Therefore, planned number of patients for the analysis is N= 98 patients per group, or N=[ADDRESS_368331] the feasibility of 
protocol adherence and data collection.

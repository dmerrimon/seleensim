devastating functional impairments including paralysis and bowel/bladder dysfunction.1   Over 
time after SCI, reorganization of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_773061] a lterations cause detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD ). It is estimated that DSD 
occurs in 75%  of suprasacral sp inal cord  injuries with up to 50% developi[INVESTIGATOR_773062].2   Neuromodu lation techniques, such  as 
transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS), currently improve bladder function and reduce 
DSD in chron ic SCI, but little is known abo ut their efficacy in acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828].[ADDRESS_1061578], we 
need to determine the safety and feasibility of a 2-week TTNS protocol in acute SCI during 
inpatient rehabilitation. Second, we will examine the effects on the bladder of this protocol as 
seen on urodynamic studies (USD ) before and after the protocol, as well as on  2-month follow- 
up. We will perform an observational study of TTNS and UDS on a ll [ADDRESS_1061579] base line urodynamics performed, and then randomized 
to a control trial (RCT) of a 2-week protocol of TTNS to test for safety and efficacy during 
inpatient rehabilitation to evaluate bladder changes based u pon pre- and post- urodynamic 
testing, as well as 2-month follow-up.  A subset of those in the experimental TTNS group will 
also ha ve a 1-month follow-up in which they will have a maintena nce session of TTNS in clinic. 
 
We will concurrently test novel high dens ity (hd) surface electrodes during the urodynamic 
studies to see  if there is cor relation between the electrical a ctivity seen by [CONTACT_773093]. We believe this has the potential to 
develop into a non -invasive outcome  measure in neurogenic bladder. We will be recording 
bladder activity with high dens ity EMG surface e lectrodes during session 1, session 5,  and 
session 10. These are the same  types of electrodes used in the UDS .  Surface electrodes will 
adhere to the skin and placed abo ve and be low the pub ic bone, placed by [CONTACT_13916].  Recordings will last the entire stimulation sess ion. 
 
We will be looking at  urine growth factors and inflammatory markers.  These markers have 
been  investigated in patients with SCI in the past, however due to technical errors, the 
conclusions have been  withdrawn.  These technical er rors have since been co rrected  and the 
biomarkers are being utilized to cha racterize other bladder pathologies, including returning to 
look at neurogenic bladder in SCI.  They are currently being used to explore the treatment 
efficacy of BOTOX in the neurogenic bladder in SCI at TIRR, in which I am  involved as a  co- 
investigator.

The status quo as  it pertains to the management of neurogenic bladder in SCI is anticholinergic 
medications to inhibit bladder activity, increase b ladder capacity, and decrease de trusor 
pressure s.[ADDRESS_1061581] imated 75% of suprasacral SCIs developi[INVESTIGATOR_773063] 50% developi[INVESTIGATOR_773064].2   Ongoing research regarding the neuromodu lation of chronic 
neurogenic bladder is promis ing, demonstrating equal efficacy to current management without 
non-comp liance and  adverse medication side effects, with imp roved quality of life.5-8   Although 
neuro-modulation techniques are currently used for chronic neurogenic bladder, little is little 
known abo ut the effects of neuromodu lation of the bladder in the acute phase of SCI recovery. 
The propos ed research is innovative, in our  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], because it represents a substantive 
departure from the status quo by  [CONTACT_773094]. Rehabilitation horizons for neurogenic bladder 
management which ha ve previously been unattainable through current efforts including the 
prevention of detrusor sphincter  dyssynergia and  related autonomic  dysreflexia, maintena nce of 
bladder capacity and compliance, and reduction in oral medication use with imp roved quality of 
life are also likely to become attainable. 
 
Electric stimulation is currently being us ed in acute neur orehabilitation. The cand idate has 
published reviews on the current state of acute rehabilitation in SCI, describing the use  of FES 
and NMES in acu te SCI for motor/sensory recovery, decreasing spasticity, and imp roving 
neuropathic pain.9, 10   There has been little pub lished regarding the effects of electric stimulation 
upon the bladder in acute SCI.  Sievert et  al. performed invasive sac ral neuromodulation in 
acute SCI in spi[INVESTIGATOR_773065] (atonic bladder seen on UDS, but time from injury was not  reported), 
with the hypothesis that early intervention would prevent the development of pathologic reflexes 
leading to DSD .11   Unlike the controls that experienced the typi[INVESTIGATOR_773066], including decreased bladder capacity and frequent UTIs comp licated  by 
[CONTACT_773095], the group  receiving the implanted neuromodulation device 
maintained normal bladder capacity, reported improved quality of life scores, and the detrusor 
did not  develop hyperactivity.11   Although the mechanism of action is unclear, it appears to be 
afferently mediated, requiring electrically induced nerve cond uction to prevent the abhorrent 
reflexes from forming which cause d etrusor overactivity and DSD.12   Less invasive, 
transc utaneous electric stimulation performed directly over the bladder for 30 sess ions over a 5 
week period in acute SCI (as early as 2 months) produced continued beneficial results based 
on UDS after 2 years.7   Based upon an extensive review of the literature on neuromodulation of 
neurogenic bladder and the clinical e xperience of our research team, we believe a TTNS 
protocol over a 2 week period will show significant improvemen ts in UDS outcomes. 
 
Concurrently, we will be testing new  hd su rface electrodes and correlate the electrical activity 
found to the pressure recordings during UDS. This harmless, non-invasive technology may 
provide a useful, quick, feasible, outcome measure in n eurogenic bladder. 
 
We will be looking at  urine growth factors and inflammatory markers to characterize neur ogenic 
bladder in SCI. They are currently being us ed to explore the treatment efficacy of BOTOX in 
the neurogenic bladder in SCI at TIR R.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/[ADDRESS_1061582] selected  a neuromodu lation technique, TTNS, that has been used safely in chronic 
SCI with good results for improving quality of life and bladder parameters as seen on  UDS, 
specifically cystometry, and we are app lying it during the acute period during inpatient 
rehabilitation. The hypotheses a re 1) TTNS will be a s afe and  feasible modality that can be 
used during acute rehabilitation and  2) a 2-week protocol of TTNS will be an effective protocol 
to improve bladder parameters, reduce oral bladder medication usage, and reduce the 
frequency of DSD and detrusor hyperreflexia (DH) at 2-month follow-up UDS . 
 
High dens ity surface electrodes are currently being studied in the bladder of animal models. 
There is a  wealth of data recorded from the electrical acti vity of the bladder and the pelvic 
muscles. The hypothesis is that there will be a correlation between UDS outcomes and the 
high definition surface electrode recordings that may allow its use as a non-invasive, novel, and 
feasible outcome measure. 
 
Studies ha ve sho wn that cytokines and chemokines responsible for autocrine, paracrine and 
endocrine signalling are also released by  [CONTACT_105]-immune cells in the bladder such as urothelium 
and detrusor cells. [Bouchelouche et a l, 2004; Bouchelouche et  al, 2006a; Bouchelouche et al, 
2006b]  The urinary bladder relies on  a broad  array of cytokines, ch emokines and growth 
factors to effect biochemical ch anges within its organ in response to disease and  therapeutic 
intervention.  But not all these ch emokines/cytokines and growth factors can ser ve as urinary 
biomarkers or surrogates of treatment response as they have to fulfil the key requirement of 
being present in detectable amounts in urine that can be  assayed us ing standard method s. 
 
The detectable amount of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the NGB patients comb ined with its 
known role in ne uroimmune interactions makes NGF an ideal ca ndidate for a urinary biomarker. 
It has been proposed that after neurologic injury, the bladder releases NGF into the urine in 
response to the injury.  NGF and  its receptors may also amplify other immunoinflammatory and 
neuronal p athways contributing to bladder inflammation and  symptoms associated with UTI. 
 
Other proteins have been co nsistently detected  in the urine of subjects with SCI or other 
neurological d iseases like MS or impairments like diabetes.  The ch emokines and cytokines 
include: interleukin IL-5, IL-6, IL-1Ra, sIL-2R, CC chemokines including MCP-1, MIP-1 β, 
RAN TES(Regulated upon Activation, Normal T Expressed and S ecreted), CXC chemokines 
including GRO-α/ CXCL1, IL-8,  and IP-10 and growth factors including vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF- 
AA), VEGF, and  PDGF.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   a. Rationale for the Study Purpose 
 
Neuromodu lation techniques ha ve been s afely used for improving neurogenic bladder in 
chron ic SCI for many years.  However, bladder neuromodu lation is rarely performed in acute 
SCI, and it is not common in ac ute rehabilitation. There has  been little published regarding the 
effects of electric stimulation upon  the bladder in acute SCI.  Sievert et al. performed invasive 
sacral n euromodu lation in acu te SCI in spi[INVESTIGATOR_773065] (atonic bladder seen on UDS , but time 
from injury was not reported), with the hypothesis that early intervention would prevent the 
development of pathologic reflexes leading to DSD .11   Unlike the controls that experienced the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_773067], including decreased bladder capacity 
and frequent UTIs complicated by [CONTACT_773096][INVESTIGATOR_602], the group  receiving the 
implanted neuromodu lation device maintained normal bladder capacity, reported improved 
quality of life scores, and the detrusor did not develop hyperactivity.11   Although the mechanism 
of action is unclear, it appears to be afferently mediated, requiring electrically induced nerve 
conduction to prevent the abh orrent reflexes from forming which cause  DH and DSD.14   Less 
invasive, transcutaneous electric stimulation performed directly over the bladder for 30 sessions 
over a 5 week period in acute SCI (as early as 2 months) produced continued ben eficial results 
based on UDS after 2 years.7 
 
Gaps in the knowledge which we intend to fill are: 
1) Safety and feasibility of TTNS in acute SCI during inpatient rehabilitation 
2) Efficacy of a 2-week TTNS protocol  in SCI based on UDS findings on 2-month follow-up. 
3) Analysis of bladder medication usage in those with and without TTNS, frequency of DSD , 
and evaluation of morbidity at 2-month follow-up 
 
The rationale for the use  of the hdEMG electrodes is to attempt to develop a no vel outcome 
measure for neurogenic bladder that is practical, feasible, and non -invasive. 
 
 
b. Rationale for Doses Selected 
 
Based upon an  extensive review of the literature on neuromodulation of neurogenic bladder and 
the clinical e xperience of the mentorship team, we believe a TTNS protocol over a [ADDRESS_1061583] injury: 
- Tetraplegia, comp lete 
- Tetraplegia, incomplete 
- Paraplegia, complete 
- Paraplegia, incomplete 
 
The age range for this study was se lected  because age-related changes that may alter the 
urodynamic studies in adults increas es over the age of 65.15 Consecutive patients meeting the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria a dmitted to inpatient rehabilitation for tSCI will be asked to enroll. 
There are approximately 200 acu te tSCI patients admitted to our institution ann ually, the 
majority of which sa tisfy the inclusion criteria. The distribution of the 4 neurologic classifications 
required is similar to the published data from the Model Systems.16   Inclusion criteria include 
IRB Page 10 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   ages 18-65 years old admitted to inpatient rehabilitation within 6 weeks of injury with a 
neurologic level of injury rostral to T10 (T9 and above).  This is a significant neurologic level 
because the bladder remains innervated at these levels, without damage to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_773068]. The RCT is 10 sessions over 2 weeks, thus discharge within 
2 weeks is undesirable. Because o ur institution serves a large geographic region, routinely 
providing care to five different s tates, the ability to return to outpatient clinic for follow-up is 
considered inclusion criteria. Although there is no clear definition of “acute” SCI, most studies 
range from 2- [ADDRESS_1061584] 
recruitment within 4 weeks of injury given cu rrent admission trends. 
 
d. Rationale for Study Design 
 
Specific Aim 1:  Safety and feasibility of TTNS in acute SCI during acu te rehabilitation.  This 
has been demonstrated in chronic SCI. 
Specific Aim 2.1:  2-week RCT of TTNS to compare UDS outcomes to controls on 2-month 
follow-up. 
Specific Aim 2.2:  Those that receive a T TNS maintena nce dose [ADDRESS_1061585] better urodynamic outcomes than both the control and those in the TTNS that did not 
receive the maintena nce dose. 
 
 
2. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES 
 
 
 
2.1. Hypothesis 
 
Hypothesis 1: TTNS will be a s afe and  feasible modality that can  be us ed in acute tSCI 
patients during inpatient rehabilitation. They will have non-significant differences in  morbidity, 
mortality, and functional outcome  measures  during their admission compared to controls. 
 
Hypothesis 2.1: Those that receive TTNS will show significant improvements in bladder 
parameters on post-UDS comp ared to both baseline UDS and the co ntrol group. 
Improvemen ts may be seen in the following UDS parameters: 
- volume at first involuntary detrusor contraction 
- maximum detrusor pres sure (cmH20) 
- bladder capacity (maximum volume infused) 
- frequency of detrusor sphincter  dyssynergia 
 
Hypothesis 2.2:  On 2-month follow-up, those that received TTNS will have sus tained bladder 
improvemen ts compared to control with less occurrence of DSD on UDS .  Those that receive a 
maintena nce dose of TTNS will have better urodynamics than those that did not. 
 
 
 
2.2. Primary Objectives 
 
Primary Objective 1:  Monitor for safety of a 2 week TTNS protocol in acute SCI. 
Primary Objective 2:  Compare  the effects upon the bladder of a 2-week TTNS protocol  in 
acute SCI versus  control group upon completion of the TTNS protocol with UDS as well as on  
2-month follow-up UDS . 
IRB Page 11 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   2.3. Secondary Objectives 
 
Secondary Objective 1:  Identify the neurologic bladder category of acute SCI based on 
baseline UDS in which TTNS is effective.  Subjects will be s tratified into the randomized trial 
based on areflexic bladder versus  not-areflexic bladder. 
 
Secondary Objective 2: Identify the effects of a maintena nce dose of TTNS one month after 
comp letion of the 2 week trial. 
 
Secondary Objective 3: Compare  the findings of hdEMG surface electrodes abo ve the pubic 
bone to the urodynamic study findings of the detrusor. 
 
Secondary Objective 4: Characterize other bladder pathologies, including neurogenic bladder 
in SCI, by [CONTACT_773097]. 
 
 
 
2.4. Potent ial Risks and  Benefits: 
 
a. End Points - Efficacy 
 
Specific Aim 1: No efficacy requirement for the safety and feasibility studied in spec ific aim 1. 
 
Specific Aim 2:  Upon completion of the randomized co ntrol trial, we expect to observe 
significant improvemen ts in UDS measures  comparing base line to post- UDS in the TTNS 
group and  at the 2-month follow-up.  The UDS outcome measures we expect  to improve are: 
 
- Increase  in bladder capacity by 50% or 100ml [ADDRESS_1061586] detrusor contraction by  50% or 100ml 13 
- Decrease in  maximum detrusor pressure by 25% [ADDRESS_1061587] the rates of morbidity to be the same between those who participate and  those who 
do not in both Aims of the research. Risks can be divided into the risks involved in having 
urodynamic studies and the risk of having electric stimulation. 
 
Urodynamic Study Risks: 
Some complications of urodynamic cystometry may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
- Urinary Tract infections (UTIs) 
- Autonomic D ysreflexia (symptoms of increased  adrena line response which may 
include increase blood pressure, headache, sweating, and flushing). 
 
UTIs are a risk any time a foreign object is introduced into the urethra and or bladder. To 
mitigate this risk, skilled urology nurses will be us ing sterile technique to insert the catheters. 
 
Autonomic D ysreflexia (AD) is a unique phenomenon which occu rs when there is an  injury or 
IRB Page 12 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   lesion between the sa crum (bottom) and the pons (top) within the sp inal cord. It may occur in 
any SCI with a neurologic level of T6 (middle spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) and above.  It occ urs whenever there is a 
noxious stimulus be low the neurologic level of injury, with a mounting stress response that may 
cause elevated blood pressures, sweating, flushing, and/or headaches. In this setting, the 
distention of the bladder during the study and/or the cath eter insertion/placement  may be the 
noxious factor. To mitigate AD: 
- Filling rate will be 4 0ml/min, rather than 50ml/min. 
- Blood pressure will be monitored every 3-5 minutes.  An elevated SBP >20mmgHG 
from baseline indicates  AD. 
- Staff will be monitoring for sweating, flushing, and asking about headaches du ring 
the study. 
- Should the patient have AD, we will stop filling for 5 minutes, reposition the patient 
and/or cath eter as needed, and examine for any other noxious stimuli. 
- After 5 minutes, we will resume the filling at 20ml/min. 
- Should the AD persist, the study will stop and we will follow the AD protocol, which 
includes che cking BP every 3-5 minutes, loosening clothes, sitting the patient up, 
emptying the bladder, examining the patient for impacted bowel, and examining the skin 
for lesions.  Should the protocol  fail in lowering the BP a nd the patient requires 
medication management to lower the BP, a code will be ca lled to better address  the 
situation. 
 
It is not routine to perform UDS acutely due to evolving bladder reflexes. However, it is 
possible to perform UDS during the acute phase of injury.  Bellucci et  al. successfully performed 
UDS on 60 ac ute SCI patients with injuries less than 40 d ays prior to the study, without reported 
morbidity secondary to the UDS .19 
 
Electric Stimulation Risks: 
Electric stimulation is commonly performed on  the extremities of those with spi[INVESTIGATOR_773069]. There are few adverse reactions to electric stimulation. The common 
ones include: 
- Pain with electric stimulation:  in these cases, the intens ity is reduced until it is 
comfortable. 
- Skin irritation: it is common for redness to occur on the skin at the site of the surface 
electrode. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_773070].  In some 
cases, the redness remains the next day.  In these case s, they are likely sensitive to the 
adhesive used and a  hypoallergenic skin electrode will be us ed.

UDS pro tocol: 
The UDS is performed in the proced ure suite at TIRR Memorial Hermann, where nursing staff 
and technicians routinely perform this study on spi[INVESTIGATOR_773071].  Briefly: 
o Sterile technique is used to empty the bladder with a lubricated catheter that inserts 
into the urethra and enters the bladder. 
o When the bladder is empty, sterile technique is used to insert lubricated catheters 
with pressure sensors through the urethra into the bladder and into the rectum while 
the patient is supi[INVESTIGATOR_773072]. 
o Surface EMG electrodes are placed on the perineal are  to record the muscle activity 
of the pelvic muscles and viscera,  including the internal urethral sp hincter. 
o Infusion of warm sa line into the bladder at a rate of 40ml/min begins the UDS, while 
the computer records the activity of the bladder. Measurements include the 
pressure  of the bladder and the abdominal pressure, as well the ca pacity and 
comp liance of the bladder. 
o The conclusion of the study occurs when bladder capacity is reached and the 
bladder will be em ptied. 
o Overall, the UDS will be performed following the guidelines of good urodynamic 
practices from the International Continence Society.[ADDRESS_1061591] novel high density (hd) surface electrodes

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   5.1. Summary  of Study Design 
 
In Specific Aim 1, we will monitor for safety and feasibility of TTNS during acute inpatient 
rehabilitation of SCI. In Specific Aim 2, the efficacy of TTNS will be s tudied by  [CONTACT_773102] 
2 groups in a 2:1 ratio of TTNS:control.  Control will be receiving brief ankle stimulation that will 
be turned off after the maximal intens ity is found. After [ADDRESS_1061593] and placed into the 
data spreadsheet.  Missing data will be requested from the attending physician or  
directly from the patient. 
c. Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TTNS) will be p laced daily by [CONTACT_773103].  Electrodes will be removed after the 30 minute session is completed.  Pain 
scores  will be co llected  before, during, and after the TTNS sess ion.  Skin inspection will 
be performed before and after each stimulation session at  the electrode sites. 
d. Bladder activity will be recorded at session 1, 5 and 10 lasting the whole stimulation 
session of all groups using the same  type of electrodes used in the UDS placed below 
and abo ve the pubic bone. 
e. Urinary levels of NGF, cytokines and chemokines will be measured  at baseline, 
discharge and follow-up appointment. Urine will be collected  by [CONTACT_773104] (CCMS) voided spec imen. Specimens will be processed  at the time of 
collection, de-identified with an untraceable number. 
 
6.2. Randomization and Blinding 
 
a. Blinding: The P.I. will be b linded to the study allocation groups. Trained research 
assistants will apply the electrodes and collect the data during the 30  minute sessions. 
b. Randomization:  After consent and the baseline UDS, subjects will be ass igned a 
number which will have already been designated as co ntrol or experimental group.  
Stratification will occ ur based on the UDS findings of areflexia versus  no areflexia. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_773073].  The research assistant will have access  to this 
file. Unplanned breaking of randomization will occur should rates of morbidity 
significantly increas e.  If breaking of randomization is required, the research ass istant 
will provide the randomization file to the PI. 
 
6.3. Contraception and Pregnancy Testing 
 
For females of childbearing age included in the trial, pregnancy testing is typi[INVESTIGATOR_773074], available in the EMR or in the provided charting.  Patient 
contraception is not applicable in ac ute spi[INVESTIGATOR_773075].

9. SAFETY MEASUREMENTS 
 
9.1. Definitions 
 
An adverse event is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or proced ure that may or may not be considered 
related to the medical treatment or procedure. 
 
The FDA definition of unanticipated adverse device effect will be us ed, as followed: An 
unanticipated adverse device effect as defined by [CONTACT_46514] 2CFR 8 12.3(s) – Any 
serious ad verse effect on hea lth or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not pre viously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or  application (including a 
supplemen tary plan or  application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with 
a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
 
Skin irritation, inflammation, and electrode burn beneath the electrodes are potential adverse 
events directly related to the use  of electric stimulation. 
 
 
 
9.2. Collecting, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
The Investigator will be responsible for collecting and reporting adverse events during the UDS. 
The research assistant and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_773083]. 
 
Grading of the severity of the adverse events will be made by [CONTACT_978], using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 developed by [CONTACT_773105]. The 
relevant “Burn” category is included below. 
 
 
 
Reporting procedures for:

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_773086] S via iRIS within 7 days, unless the report 
involves the death of a participant, in which case  the report needs to be provided to CPHS 
within 24 hours. 
 
9.3. Safety Monitoring Plan 
 
The Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for the research study includes periodic statistical 
analysis on rates of morbidity of study participants compared to controls by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_46494].  Because of the rolling recruitment in the propos ed protocol, we anticipate the 
number of recruited individuals will be suf ficient for morbidity review quarterly. 
 
Specifically, we will focus on the occurrence of UTI. We hypothesize that the rate of UTIs in 
TTNS group will be similar to the co ntrol group. Based on literature, the rate of UTIs ranges 
from 20% to 50% in acute SCI patients, plus the addition of the incidence of UTI post UDS in 
acute SCI may be nearly 16%.  As a result, we will stop the study if there is evidence to supp ort 
UTI rate more than 40% in the TTNS group. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_773087] 95% 
Blyth-Still-Casella con fidence bou nds.  If the number of cases of UTI exceed the specified 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]: ≥ 8 UTIs in 10 patients, ≥ 13 UTIs in 20 patients, ≥ 18 UTIs in 30 patients, ≥ 23 
UTIs in 40 patients, then patient accrual will be p aused pen ding a review by [CONTACT_144278]. 
 
 
10. DATA ANALYSIS 
 
10.1. Data Quality Assurance 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46496].  Single data entry will be 
performed with plans to check 10% of primary variables as  a quality control.  Single data entry 
error rates are slightly higher than 0.5% when performed by [CONTACT_773106].25 Data anomalies will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_46497]/or correction 
will be p erformed. Incomplete entries will be reviewed and corrected if information is available. 
 
10.2. Data Entry and Storage  
 
Data will be e ntered on a spreads heet file located  on the TIRR Memorial Hermann password- 
protected desktop computer of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_773088] a locked office in  TIRR Memorial Hermann. 
After data from reports generated from the UDS are entered into the spreadsheet, they will be 
filed in a study binder in a locked drawer in the office of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_773089]. 
 
5 years after manuscri pt publication, the paper reports will be p laced into the shredd er bins for 
destruction. 
 
 
 
11. SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
11.1. Determination of Sample Size 
 
Our working hypothesis is that responders to TTNS would increase bladder capacity 100ml or 
50%, which requires n=60.  Sample size cons ideration was based on  the working hypothesis 
with at least 80% power to detect an effect size of 1.0, regarding increased  bladder capacity 
IRB Page 22 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/[ADDRESS_1061599] size of 
1.0, this samp le would result in a power of 88.3%.  Power analysis was pe rformed using the 
Proc Po wer in SAS with the paired sample t-test under assumed pairwise co rrelation of 0.5. 
 
11.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans 
 
The primary outcome measures for SA [ADDRESS_1061600] (for continuous measures) a nd 
McNemar  test (for discrete measures) will be us ed to comp are data as two samples come from 
the same subject.  Multivariate ana lysis will be c onsidered when patients’ clinical variables are 
included as a  confounding factor.  If significant differences are found, then we will use p ost-hoc 
analyses us ing ANOVA to compare each of the primary end points. We will also cond uct 
pairwise co mparisons to identify which pa irs of the study arms have different mean outcomes. 
 
The primary outcome measures for SA 2 are the changes in the UDS parameters after 2 weeks 
of TTNS versus  sham stimulation, with UDS performed at the end of the 2-week trial and again 
on follow-up in 2 months, which will use a s imilar statistical a pproach  as in SA 1.  When the 
study concerns  multiple comparis ons among four groups, the Bonferroni method  will be us ed to 
ensure that the overall type I e rror remains be low 0.05.  A p-value of <0.05 is considered 
statistically significant.  All statistic al analysis will be co nducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc. Cary, NC). 
 
The secondary outcome measures  include ana lyses of the differences  amongst the 2 groups of 
neurogenic bladder in SCI according to baseline UDS . This will be a nalyzed with generalized 
mixed models (GMMs) which can  also afford a multivariate ana lysis to account for potential 
confounders.[ADDRESS_1061601] potential se lection bias by [INVESTIGATOR_163792], the analysis will be 
supplemen ted by [CONTACT_773107].27

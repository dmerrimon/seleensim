METHODOLOGY  
This multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study will be performed in 
approximately [ADDRESS_272888], therapy should be continued for approximately 
another 2 weeks to maintain corpus luteum  function  (continue until confirmatory serum 
pregnancy test).  Subjects will discontinue treatment either at the onset of menses or after having 
two (2) negative or two (2) positive confirmatory serum pregnancy test s. Subjects will be 
required to return to the study site for pharmacodynamic blood draws, TVUS, serum pregnancy 
tests, and safety follow -up assessments.  
The study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (includes progestin challenge test), Treatment 
(includes pi[INVESTIGATOR_226931]), and Follow -up. 
Screening (Day -60 to Day -1): Only subjects with diagnosed primary amenorrhea with HH 
should be screened.  Only subjects who desire p regnancy will be eligible to participate in the trial.  
The site will obtain written informed consent before any study -related procedures begin.  Upon 
signing the Informed Consent Form, subjects will be screened based on inclusion/exclusion 
criteria.  The a ssessments during the screening period will include medical/gynecologic history, 
safety laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), other laboratory tests (serum 
pregnancy, LH, FSH, E 2, P4, prolactin [PRL], and thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH] l evels), 
vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature),  Papanicolaou (PAP) smear (if not done 
within the last 24  months; PAP smear may be performed at Screening and for every patient if 
warranted, per investigator discretion), TVUS documenting  normal uterus and adnexa, and a 
physical/gynecological examination.  A normal or stable computed tomography (CT) scan or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_226932].  T he male partner should have a recent normal semen 
analysis (within 1 year). A progestin challenge test will also be initiated to confirm HH.

Clinical Trial Protocol - Amendment 7  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  Rescreening will be allowed at the investigators’ discretion for subjects who exhibit laboratory 
tests outside of t he normal or required range.  No subject may be rescreened more than once.  
Rescreening for the progestin challenge test is not allowed.  
Progestin challenge test :  After confirmed negative serum pregnancy test, subjects will be 
dispensed 10 mg of medroxypr ogesterone acetate (Provera®) once daily for [ADDRESS_272889] dose of progestin will 
continue to the treatment period.  Per investigator’s discretion, occasional spotting is not 
considered withdrawal  bleeding.  Subjects with uterine bleeding are considered screen 
failures and will be ineligible for study participation.   Rescreening for the progestin 
challenge test is not allowed.  
Treatment (Day 1 to approximately Day 37) : Subjects who do not have uter ine bleeding within 
[ADDRESS_272890] dose of progestin will return to the clinic; a negative urine pregnancy test 
result is required and then the subject will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment arms: 
LutrePulse OmniPod SC 10 μg/pulse, 15 μg/puls e, 20 μg/pulse, or placebo (10, 15, or 20 μg/pulse 
delivery setting) every [ADDRESS_272891] OmniPod pump 
will be applied on Day 1.  Each OmniPod pump will be worn for 3 days (Days 1 -3, 4-6, 7-9, etc. 
to approximately Day 37).  The subject will apply subsequent OmniPod pumps every 4th day at 
approximately the same time as the 1st application  (±1 hour) . 
Pharmacodynamic assessments :  A blood sample for E 2, LH and FSH will be taken on 
Day 1 (pre -treatment baseline) prior to dosing.  Additional blood samples for only LH and 
FSH will be taken 5, 15, 30, 60, and [ADDRESS_272892] dose is administered.   
A blood sample for E 2, LH and FSH will be taken on Day 10 at the same time as the  Day 1 
initial sample (±1  hour) and before the first dose is administered by [CONTACT_48657] [ADDRESS_272893] dose is administered.

mean diameter ≥  15 mm by [CONTACT_226953] E 2 levels ≥  1200 pg/mL) will be discontinued from 
treatment.  
LH surge detection:  Clearblue® digital ovulation urine test will begin when follicles with a 
mean diameter ≥ [ADDRESS_272895] ( Appendix II). 
The subject should notify the site immediately once the surge has been detected to schedule 
a visit within 72 hours for a confirmatory TVUS.  Subjects will be advised to engage in 
sexual intercourse on the day of LH surge, the day following LH surge, an d per 
investigator’s discretion thereafter. The subject should also document the date(s) of sexual 
intercourse on the subject diary card.  
If LH surge is not detected  after [ADDRESS_272896] will be discontinue d.  
However, the treatment m ay be continued for a maximum of 3 9 days at the discretion of the 
investigator if the patient has growing follicle(s) .The subject will be instructed to visit the 
site to return all study drug and the OmniPod System.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  DURATION OF TREATMENT  
LutrePulse (gonadorelin acetate) delivered via pulsatile injection every 90 minutes (1 -minute 
delivery followed by [CONTACT_1629] 89 -minute gap) for a total of approximately [ADDRESS_272906] response; 
it is expected that follicular  response to LutrePulse will occur within 2 to 3 weeks after therapy 
initiation.  However, the treatment may be continued for a maximum of 3 9 days at the discretion 
of the investigator if the patient has growing follicle(s).   Additionally, w hen ovulation occurs, 
therapy should be continued for approximately another 2 weeks to maintain corpus luteum  
function  (continue until confirmatory serum p regnancy test) .   
STATISTICAL METHODS  
Sample size :  
The sample size was determined based on the original fixed parallel group study design. The true 
ovulation rate for LutrePulse OmniPod SC 20 μg, 15 μg, 10 μg, and placebo was assumed to be 
70%, 65%, 60%,  and 1%, respectively.  Under these assumptions, a sample size of 14 subjects 
per group (total 56  subjects) will provide at least 80% power to detect differences between 
LutrePulse OmniPod SC 20 μg and placebo, 15 μg and placebo, and 10 μg and placebo in 
ovulation rate separately  using stratified one -sided Fisher’s exact tests19 at an overall one -sided 
significance level of 0.025  with the closed testing procedure (Kong et al., 2005)18 to be used for 
the primary efficacy a nalysis.   
Approximately 60  subjects will be randomized, assuming up to 4 subjects may be ineligible for 
the full analysis set (FAS).  
Efficacy :  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on all randomized subjects who received at least 14 
days of study d rug for pi[INVESTIGATOR_226934] (i.e., FAS).  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be ovulation rate calculated as the proportion of subjects who 
had at least [ADDRESS_272907]-baseline value of P 4 level ≥  6 ng/mL  or pregnancy  confirmed by a positive 
serum β -hCG (i.e., 2 posi tive results) or presence of a gestational sac documented by [CONTACT_226955] (TVUS) .  A Bayesian adaptive design is adopted to address the following objectives:  
1. Demonstrate superiority of the pooled middle and high doses over placebo  in the 
ovulation rate  
2. Evaluate  the dose -response relationship  
The adaptive design includes two interim analyses, conducted after approximately 9 and 12 
patients per arm enrolling in the study, respectively. The interim analysis provides an opportunity 
for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_226935]. Furthermore, it allows the

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  low dose to be dropped following the interim look if it shows a much lower response rate 
compared with the middle and high doses .  
Each interim analysis will result in one of the following  possible  outcomes:  
1. Continue the trial with all arms  
2. Continue the trial without the low dose  
3. Declare early success,  but continue the trial without placebo  
4. Declare early success and stop the trial (both placebo and low dose dropped)  
5. Stop the trial for futility  
When  the primary efficacy analysis is not successful at the interim analysis, and if the ovulation 
rate i n the low -dose arm is sufficiently low, satisfying  
                                           Rlow < (R high +middle ) – 0.2,                                                      (1)  
then the trial will continue without the low dose, resulting in outcome #2 listed above. Note that 
Rlow and Rhigh +middle  in inequality (1)  are the observed ovulation rates in the low dose arm and the 
combined middle - and high -dose arms, respectively. However, if inequality (1) is not satisfied, 
then the trial will continue with all arms (outcome #1  listed above ).  
Conversely, when success on the primary efficacy analysis is declared at an interim analysis, if 
the response rate in the low -dose arm meets the condition in inequality (1), then the trial is 
completed at this point (ou tcome #4  listed above ) with dose selection using the ED80 rule (see 
below).   
In the case the primary efficacy analysis is successful, but the response rate in the low -dose arm 
is within 20% from the combined low - and high -dose success rate, the trial is not stopped 
immediately. Rather, the trial will continue to enroll additional p atients into the low -, middle - and 
high-dose arms to further assess dose responses.  
Finally, the trial may terminate (outcome #5  listed above ) as a result of a low predictive 
probability of success (<0.05) given the data collected at the interim analysis.   
At the end of the study, for a trial that achieves efficacy success, the dose to be selected as the 
lowest effective dose is the ED80 dose, defined as the lowest dose that retains at least 80% of the 
largest treatment effect, i.e.  
                                  (RED80 – Rplacebo ) ≥ (R maximum  – Rplacebo ) ×0.8,                                   (2)  
where R maximum  is the observed ovulation rate in the most effective dose arm, R placebo  is the 
observed ovulation rate in the placebo ar m, and R ED80 is the observed ovulation rate in the 
selected dose arm.  
The primary efficacy analysis will compare the pooled ovulation rate of LutrePulse OmniPod SC 
20 g and 15 g to placebo. Let Phigh+middle  and  Pplacebo  be the underlying ovulation rates in the 
combined middle - and high -dose arms and the placebo arm, respectively. The hypotheses for the 
one-sided statistical testing are:

The hypotheses are tested using a stratifie d one -sided Fisher’s exact test (Jung et al., 2014) in the 
FAS including the randomization scheme as the stratification factor. The SAS PROC FREQ with 
permutation -based Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test with exact p -value derived from all possible 
permutations  will be employed for the calculation of p -value for the stratified Fisher’s exact test.  
To account for the multiplicities introduced by [CONTACT_226956],  Pocock boundaries 
are used. Thus, t he success threshold at each analysis corresponds to a  nominal p -value < 0.0131 
to maintain an overall one -sided type I error rate of 0.025.  
Sensitivity analysis:  
• will be performed  on the PPS  
• will be performed on the mITT  
For the secondary efficacy analyses, clinical and biochemical pregnancy rates will be compared 
between the pooled middle - and high-dose arms vs. the placebo arm  using the same statistical 
method to be applied to the primary efficacy analysis.  Numbers of follicles with a mean diameter 
≥ 14 mm and dominant follicles with a mean diameter ≥18  mm will be compared using 
Wilcoxon’s rank sum test by [CONTACT_226957].  The maximum P 4 
level and the mean P 4 level from Days 19, 21, 23, 25 , and 27  values will be compared using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including the treatment group and  randomization 
scheme as factors and mean baseline value as covariate.  The proportion of subjects with at least

statistical method to be applied to the primary efficacy analysis. The mean FSH and LH on Day 
10, as well as the change from baseline, will be compared using ANCOVA model  including the

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Pulsatile gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) has been widely used in the [LOCATION_002] (US) 
and Europe for over [ADDRESS_272921] and a high degree of effectiveness in treating primary hypothalamic amenorrhea and 
in inducing ovulation and pregnancy in a variety of infertile patients.  Pulsatile GnRH is safer than 
other parenteral preparations and has a much lower incidence of inducing multiple pregnancies or 
ovarian hyperstimulation than other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12985] -estrogens or gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115].1,2  
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), characterized by [CONTACT_226959] (LH) and follicle -stimula ting hormone (FSH) in the setting of 
hypogonadism, may be amenable to treatment with GnRH.   
Several investigations utilizing subcutaneous (SC) administration of GnRH, including 
pharmacokinetic studies conducted by [CONTACT_2247], showed favorable GnRH and LH pro files and 
ovulation and pregnancy rates comparable to intravenous (IV) regimens.3,4,5,6,[ADDRESS_272922] approved in Europe as Lutrelef® in 1983 and as LutrePulse™ in the US in 1989 and in 
Canada in 1993  with different pumps . 
LutrePulse (gonadorelin acetate) was approved in the US for use in patients with primary 
hypothalamic a menorrhea administered IV via the Zyklomat® pump, but was later withdrawn from 
the market for commercial reasons.  Therefore, no approved GnRH product is currently available 
for ovulation induction and treatment of primary hypothalamic amenorrhea patients in the US.   
LutrePulse (known as Lutrelef) with Om niPod for subcutaneous use was approved in [LOCATION_009] 
(2009), Netherlands (2010) and [LOCATION_013] (2011) to treat both men and women with GnRH 
deficiency or GnRH impairment.  In 2012 , Lutre Pulse ( gonadorelin acetate ) with the OmniPod 
device for subcutaneous administration was also approved and re -introduced in Canada for 
ovulation induction in patients with pri mary hypothalamic amenorrhea.  
The OmniPod® pump is a disposable SC delivery pump for LutrePulse with a hand -held wireless 
controller (the Manager).9  The OmniPod has been demonstrated to provide similar volume and 
similar bolus/pulse accuracy as the Zyklomat IV pump (data on file).  In addition, the stability of

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  LutrePulse solution over t he intended period of use was demonstrated for the OmniPod pump (data 
on file).  Compared to the IV pumps, the OmniPod SC pump with Lutre Pulse (Gonadorelin Acetate) 
represents a technologically advanced and more patient -friendly solution for pulsatile drug  delivery .  
If a successful efficacy and safety profile is established  for GnRH with the OmniPod , this will 
address the current unmet need in the very rare population of patients  with HH  in the US . 
1.[ADDRESS_272923] been previously reported in the literature for two IV doses of p ulsatile GnRH 
administered to GnRH -deficient women:  75 ng/kg (~3 -4 µg/pulse) and 100 ng/kg (~5  µg/pulse).8  
The recommended GnRH dose for primary hypothalamic amenorrhea women in the previously 
approved label for LutrePulse with IV pump was 5 µg IV every 90 minutes, which could be 
increased up to 20 µg in step wise fashion if there wa s no response.  The efficacy and safety of 10 
and 20 µg/pulse administered SC in terms of ovulation induction w ere studied and published in 
literature in the past (See Section  5.5 for more details ) but there is currently  a need for a well -
powered and well -controlled , randomized  clinical trial to confirm the efficacy and safety profile of 
Lutre Pulse with OmniPod s ubcutaneous delivery pump .   
In addition to the 10 and 20 µg/pulse doses, an intermediate dose of 15 µg/pulse has been added to 
better understand the dose range.  This study is expected to provide much needed efficacy and 
safety information in this very ra re HH population of patients.

3.1 Overall Design and Plan – Description  
This multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study will be performed in 
approximately [ADDRESS_272927], therapy should be conti nued for approximately another 2 weeks to 
maintain corpus luteum  function  (continue until confirmatory serum pregnancy test).  Subjects will 
discontinue treatment either at the onset of menses or after having two (2) negative or two (2) 
positive confirmatory serum pregnancy test s.  Subjects will be required to return to the study site for 
pharmacodynamic blood draws, TVUS, serum pregnancy tests, and safety follow -up assessments.  
The study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (includes progestin ch allenge test), Treatment 
(includes pi[INVESTIGATOR_226936] 14 days and treatment phase), and Follow -up. 
Screening (Day -60 to Day -1): Only subjects with diagnosed primary amenorrhea with HH should 
be screened for this trial.  Only subjects who desire preg nancy will b e eligible to participate in this  
trial. 
The site will obtain written informed consent before any study -related procedures begin.  Upon 
signing the I nformed Consent Form, subjects will be screened based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
The ass essments during the screening period will include medical/gynecologic history, safety 
laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), other laboratory tests (serum pregnancy, LH, 
FSH, E 2, P4, prolactin [PRL], and thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH] levels), vital signs (blood 
pressure, heart rate, body temperature), Papanicolaou ( PAP ) smear (if not done within the last 
24 months ; PAP smear may be performed at Screening and for every patient if warranted, per 
investigator discretion), TVUS documenting normal uterus and adnexa, and a 
physical/gynecological examination.  A normal or stable computed tomography (CT) scan or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_226932].  The male partner should have a documented recent normal 
semen analysis  (within 1 year) .  A progestin challenge test will be initiated to confirm HH.   
Rescreening will be allowed at the investigators’ discretion for s ubjects who exhibit laboratory tests 
outside of the normal or required range.   No subject may be rescreened more than once.  
Rescreening for the progestin challenge test is not allowed.

dispensed 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera®)[ADDRESS_272929] dose of progestin will continue to the 
treatment period .  Per i nvestigator’s discretion, occasional spotting is not considered withdrawal 
bleeding.  Subjects with ute rine bleeding are considered screen failures and will be ineligible for 
study participation.   Rescreening for the progestin challenge test is not allowed.  
Treatment (Day 1 to approximately Day 3 7): Subject who do not have uterine bleeding within 
[ADDRESS_272930] dose of progestin will return to the clinic; a negative urine pregnancy test result 
is required and then the subject will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment arms: LutrePulse 
OmniPod SC 10 μg/pulse, 15 μg/pulse, 20 μg/pulse , or placebo (10 , 15, and 20 μg/pulse delivery 
setting) every 90 minutes.   
Subjects will be instructed on the application of the OmniPod pump (See Instructions for Use 
[IFU]) .11,[ADDRESS_272931] OmniPod pump will be applied on Day 1.  Each OmniPod pump will be wo rn 
for 3 days (Days 1 -3, 4-6, 7-9, etc. to approximately Day 3 7).  The subject will apply subsequent 
OmniPod pumps every 4th day at approximately the same time as the first application  (±1 hour) .   
Pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments :  A blood sample for E 2, LH and FSH will be taken on Day  1 
(pretreatment baseline) prior to dosing.  Additional blood samples for only LH and FSH will be 
taken 5, 15, 30, 60, and [ADDRESS_272932] dose is administered.

sample (±1 hour) and before the first dose is administered by [CONTACT_48657] [ADDRESS_272933] dose is 
administered.   
Follicular and endometrial development: Follow -up will begin on Day 10 of treatment.  
Follicular and endometrial development will be monitored by [CONTACT_226952]’s discretion  (minimum of 3 TVUS) , until a dominant follicle of ≥  18 mm mean 
diameter and normal endometrium (thickness and pattern) are confirmed.  If a dominant follicle ≥ 
18 mm mean diameter is not observed after 21 full days of treatment, the therapy will be 
discontinued .  However, the treatment may be continued for a maximum of 3 9 days at the discretion 
of the investigator if the patient has growing follicle(s) .  After Day 10, a single blood sample for E [ADDRESS_272934] who has an 
increased risk of develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_226933]/ OHSS (4 or more follicles with a mean diameter ≥ 
15 mm by [CONTACT_226960] E 2 levels ≥ 1200 pg/mL) will be discontinued from treatment.

following LH surge, and per investigator’s discretion thereafter.  The subject should also document 
the date(s) of sexual intercourse on the subject diary card.  
If LH surge is not detected after [ADDRESS_272936] will be discontinued.  However, 
the treatment may be continued for a maximum of 3 9 days at the discretion of the investigator if the 
patient has growing follicle(s) .  The subject will be instructed to visit the site to return all study drug 
and the OmniPod System.  
Blood samples for progesterone (P 4) levels:  A single blood sample for P 4 will be taken on Day 1 
(pre-treatment baseline) prior to dosing.  Blood samples will also be obtained on Day 19, Day 21, 
Day 23, Day [ADDRESS_272937] discontinued the 
study early and ended treatment on or after Day 14, a blood sample will also be taken at the End-of-
Study Visit .  
Menses Onset:   Subjects who begin menstruating after treatment was initiated  will be instructed to 
stop the treatment and to visit the site to return all study drug and the OmniPod System .  The site 
will record the first day of menses and duration of menses for all non -pregnant subjects.  
Serum pregnancy tests ( -hCG):  will be per formed 14 days (+ 4 days) after LH surge and [ADDRESS_272938] will return within 5 days (unscheduled visit) to confirm

This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  trial.  Subjects with primary 
amenorrhea with HH will be treated with 1 of 3 doses of pulsatile GnRH , or placebo, administered 
SC via the OmniPod  pump manufactured by [CONTACT_45915].  
The three active dose regimens of GnRH and placebo will be administered  using indistinguishable 
vials to maintain the blind .  Insulet  is a leader in wearable insulin pump technology with its 
OmniPod Insulin Management System.  The OmniPod Insulin Management System, a 
revolutionary, discreet and easy -to-use insulin infusion sy stem, features 2 easy -to-use parts with no 
tubing and fully automated cannula insertion.  Insulet worked with Ferring Pharmaceuticals to 
develop a system for the delivery of gonadorelin acetate.  A custom version of the OmniPod's 
Personal Diabetes Manager was developed, which was the first non -diabetes drug delivery 
application for the OmniPod System.  The OmniPod System is expected to be an effective platform 
technology for the delivery of various drugs that require continuous or frequent infusions , includ ing

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  Drug Delivery System  
The OmniPod Drug Delivery system is a disposable delivery pump (OmniPod) with a handheld 
wireless controller (the Manager) for SC drug delivery (see  Figure 1).  The OmniPod is a discreet 
and easy -to-use delivery pump featuring two parts, with no tubing and fully automated cannula 
insertion manufactured by [CONTACT_226961] (locat ed at [ADDRESS_272948], MA, US).  A 
custom version of the originally developed OmniPod's Manager (wireless controller for insulin 
delivery) was subsequently modified for use with LutrePulse.  
The OmniPod is a small (1.530” wide × 2.055” long × 0.575”  high), lightweight (<  1.1 oz.), self -
adhesive device filled with LutrePulse or placebo and worn directly on the body.  The OmniPod 
delivers precise doses of LutrePulse or placebo through a small flexible subcutaneous cannula, 
based on instructions program med into its wireless controller, the Drug Delivery Manager.  The 
deliverable reservoir volume is 2000 μL.  The cannula insertion depth is between 6  and 7 mm at 
≤ 50° insertion angle when measured from the perpendicular axis to the skin, and the cannula is  
inserted only once with each OmniPod.  
The OmniPod’s adhesive keeps it securely in place for up to 3 days.  Body lotion, creams, or oils 
should not be used near the infusion site, as these products may loosen the adhesive.  The infusion 
site should be chan ged each time a new OmniPod is applied; the new site should be at least [ADDRESS_272949]’s 
LutrePulse or placebo delivery instructions and wirelessly monitors the OmniPod’s operation.  The 
Manager is 2.5” wide × 4.5” long × 1.0” high, and it weighs 4.[ADDRESS_272950] keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and automated cannula insertion.

5.4 Blinding / Unblinding  
5.4.1 Blinding  
To ensure blinding, subjects assigned to placebo will be randomized to 1 of 3 placebo “dose” 
groups – 10 g, 15 g, or 20 g according to a computer -generated randomization list prepared for 
all trial sites.  Study personnel involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded to the assigned 
drug product (active or placebo) regardless of dose.  The OmniPod Manager will displa y the dose 
once it has been programmed for a subject, regardless of active or placebo assignment.  
All eligible subjects will be randomly assigned at least 5 days before Treatment Day 1  (7 days for 
sites in Canada) , based on the computer -generated randomiza tion list.  The first 15 eligible subjects 
will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms: LutrePulse OmniPod SC 10 g, LutrePulse 
OmniPod SC 20 μg, or OmniPod SC placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio.  The subsequent 25 eligible subjects 
will be randomly assigned to LutrePulse OmniPod SC 10 g, LutrePulse OmniPod SC 15 g, 
LutrePulse OmniPod SC 20 μg, or OmniPod SC placebo in a 1:2:1:[ADDRESS_272956] of the eligible

to the OmniPod Manager programmer ( unblinded coordinator), but not to any other site personnel 
involved in the conduct and evaluation of the study until the study database is declared clean and is 
released to the statistician.   
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator will assig n a coordinator to act as the unblinded 
coordinator.  This person will be the only person unblinded to the subject’s study drug dose and will 
be responsible for the set -up of the Manager, distribution and accountability of the drug.  Although 
the unblinded c oordinator will be aware of the dose assigned, the unblinded coordinator will not be 
aware of whether the subject is receiving active drug or placebo.  The unblinded coordinator will 
instruct each subject as to the proper administration and the timing of a dministration of the study 
drug.  This person will be available to answer the subject’s questions regarding study drug and its 
administration.  
The integrity of the blind will be further preserved by r equiring each subject and the unblinded 
coordinator to s ign a nondisclosure affidavit form ( Appendix I) instructing subjects and the 
unblinded coordinator not to disclose the study drug dosage.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_272958] Treatment  
An emergency decoding possibility  (either a code envelope or another system) will be available to 
the investigator and designated persons at Ferring.  Breaking of the blind for individual subjects in 
emergency situations is only permitted in case of an important adverse event where the kn owledge 
of the IMP in question is required for therapeutic decisions for the management of the subject.  
As far as the emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by [CONTACT_2183].  The person who opens a code envelope must record on it the reason and the date of 
opening, and then sign and date the opened envelope if a code envelope is prepared.  If the 
randomization is done via an electronic system , the system will record the access for this 
unblinding. It should be recorded  in the eCRF that the code is broken, why, when , and by [CONTACT_20898].  
The investigator must record the event of unblinding in the subject’s medical record, including the 
reason for unblinding, but not the treatment allocation if this can be avoided.  
In case of ac cidental unblinding to the dose (e.g. , the subject tells the investigator), the same 
documentation as for emergency unblinding must be obtained, i.e. , why, when and by [CONTACT_226963], and the event must also be recorded in the subject’s med ical record.

5.5 Selec tion of Doses in the Study  
The selected GnRH dose per pulse will be either 10 μg , 15 g, or 20 μg  delivered at 90 -minute 
intervals.   
The SC GnRH doses proposed in this study are based on existing Ferring data and previously 
published research. The 20 μg d ose has been used successfully in clinical studies in the US and 
Europe.3   
In a pharmacokinetic study conducted in a small group of women with hypothalamic amenorrhea, 
SC GnRH administration resulted in pulsatile plasma GnRH and gonadotropin responses 
resembling t hose seen after IV GnRH.15  No significant differences were found between peak LH 
responses to 10  µg/pulse of IV and SC doses of GnRH administered  at 90-minute intervals.   
In Ferring Study 2005 -06, the SC route was associated with a slightly lower rise to peak and a 
slower disappearance of GnRH from the circulation; however, SC and IV dosing produced similar 
peak concentrations and total exposures (area under the  concentration -time curve, AUC).5  The 
study showed 25% bioavailability with SC compared to IV administration of GnRH.  Thus, if the 
most commonly used initiating dose of the IV route is 5 µg /pulse, the SC dose needed to achieve 
approximately the same blood concentration GnRH levels is e xpected to be 4 -fold higher, namely, 
20 µg /pulse.  
Ferring Study 000010 demonstrated favorable GnRH and LH profiles following SC administration 
of 20 µg/pulse doses every 90 minutes of LutrePulse with the OmniPod device.7  Martin (1990) 
reported that [ADDRESS_272960] based on the GnRH pulse frequency in normal

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  7.6.6 Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome Monitoring  
In women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, an excessive response to follicular 
stimulating agents may lead to the development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).  
OHSS represents a spectrum that can be categorized as mild, moderate o r severe.   
The following table will be used in assessing and classifying the severity of OHSS . 
Table 2 Classification of Mild, Moderate and Severe OHSS17 
Mild OHSS  
     Grade 1  Abdominal distension and discomfort  
     Grade 2  Features of grade 1 plus nausea/vomiting and/or diarrhea. Ovaries enlarged to 
5-12 cm.a) 
Moderate OHSS  
     Grade 3  Features of mild OHSS plus ultrasonic evidence of ascites.b) 
Severe OHSS  
     Grade 4  Features of moderate OHSS plus clinical evidence of ascites and/or hydrothorax 
(or breathing difficulties). Paracentesis due to OHSS symptoms. c) 
     Grade 5  All of the above plus change in blood volume, inc reased blood viscosity due to 
hemoconcentration, coagulation abnormalities, and diminished renal perfusion and 
function.d)  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226942].  
a) For each ovary, the size will be the average of the greatest diameter and its greatest perpendicular diameter. Ovarian 
enlargement will be based on the average size of the right and left ovaries. The sizes of both ovaries should be 
recorded.  
b) For subjects with transvaginal evidence of ascites, the size of the fluid pockets in the pelvis (Douglas pouch, vesico -
uterine pouch, etc.) should be estimated by [CONTACT_2206], 
and multiplying these two numbers (the unit will be cm2). Peritoneal fluid is the total size o f all fluid pockets in the 
pelvis.  
c) In case of paracentesis, the volume of fluid drained should be measured.  
d) Hemoconcentration is defined as hematocrit >45 %. Electrolyte disturbances is defined as hyponatremia (sodium 
<135 mEq/L) and/or hyperkalemia (pota ssium >5.0 mEq/L). Coagulation abnormalities are defined as presence of 
thromboembolic events, abnormal prothrombin time or abnormal activated partial thrombin time. Diminished renal 
perfusion is defined as creatinine >1.2 mg/dl. Oliguria is defined as uri ne output less than 500  mL / [ADDRESS_272995] and on the Adverse Event page in the eCRF.  Severe OHSS that requires medical or 
surgical intervention (i.e., paracentesis, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], dopamine administration) is considered a 
serious adverse event (see Section  8.3).

If a subject suffers from the same adverse event more than once and the subject recovers in between 
the events, the adver se events should be recorded separately.  If an adverse event changes in 
intensity, a worst -case approach should be used when recording the event, i.e. , the highest intensity

event) changes in intensity, this must be recorded as two separate events.  The initial adverse event should be 
recorded with outcome “not yet recovered” and the date and time of outcome is when t he intensity changed.  
The second adverse event should be recorded with date and time of onset when the intensity changed.

Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.  
Moderate:  Event sufficient  to affect usual activity (disturbing).  
Severe:  Inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).  
Causal Relationship to IMP  
The possibility of whether the IMP caused the adverse event must be classified as one of the 
following:  
Reasonable poss ibility:  There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the 
IMP and the adverse event.  The adverse event may occur as part of the pharmacological action of 
the IMP or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
Examples:  
• adverse even ts that are uncommon but are known to be strongly associated with IMP 
exposure.  
• adverse events that are not commonly associated with IMP exposure, but the event occurs in 
association with other factors strongly suggesting causation, such as a strong tempor al 
association or the event recurs on re -challenge.  
No reasonable possibility:    There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IMP and the adverse event.  
Examples:  
• known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  9 STATI STICAL METHODS  
Details of the statistical methodology will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan.   
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size was determined based on the original fixed parallel group study design. The true 
ovulation rate for LutrePulse OmniPod SC 20  μg, 15 μg, 10 μg, and placebo was assumed to be 
70%, 65%, 60%, and 1%, respectively.  Under these assumptions, a sample size of 14 subjects per 
group (total 56 subjects) will provide at least 80% power to detect differences between LutrePulse 
OmniPod SC 20  μg and placebo , 15 μg and placebo, and 10  μg and placebo in ovulation rate 
separately using  the stratified one-sided Fisher’s exact tests 19 at an overall one-sided significance 
level of 0.025  with the closed testing procedure (Kong et al., 2005)18 to be used for the primary 
efficacy analysis .   
Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized , assuming up to 4 subjects may be ineligible for the 
full analysis set ( FAS). 
9.[ADDRESS_273006] -baseline discontinuations will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_41794].  The number of subjects screened  and not randomized

Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_226970] -therapeutic -chemical (ATC) 
classification 1st level (alphabetically) and ATC classification 2nd level (in decreasing order of 
frequency) . 
9.6 Efficacy Endpoint Assessments  
9.6.1 General Considerations  
A Bayesian adaptive design is adopted to address the following objectives:  
1. Demonstrate superiority of the pooled middle and high doses over placebo  in the 
ovulation rate  
2. Evaluate  the dose -respons e relationship  
The adaptive design includes two interim analyses, conducted after approximately 9 and 12 patients 
per arm enrolling in the study, respectively. The interim analysis provides an opportunit y for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_226949] s utilizing the group sequential strategy or due to 
efficacy futility through Bayesian predictive probability of success. Furthermore, it allows the low 
dose to be dropped following the interim look if it shows a much lower response rate compared 
with the middle and high doses .  
Each interim analysis will result in one of the following possible outcomes:  
1. Continue the trial with all arms  
2. Continue the trial without the low dose  
3. Declare early success, but continue the trial without placebo  
4. Declare early success and stop the trial (both placebo and low dose dropped)  
5. Stop the trial for futility

then the trial will continue without the low dose, resulting in outcome #2 listed above. Note that 
Rlow and Rhigh +middle  in inequality (1) are the observed ovulation rates in the low dose arm and the 
combined middle - and high -dose arms, respectively. However, if inequality (1) is not satisfied, then 
the trial will continue with all arms (outcome #1  listed above ).  
Conversely, wh en success on the primary efficacy analysis is declared at an interim analysis, if the 
response rate in the low -dose arm meets the condition in inequality (1), then the trial is completed at 
this point (outcome #4  listed above ) with dose selection performe d using the ED80 rule (see below).   
In the case the primary efficacy analysis is successful, but the response rate in the low -dose arm is 
within 20% from the combined low - and high -dose success rate, the trial is not stopped 
immediately. Rather, the trial  will continue to enroll additional patients into the low -, middle - and 
high-dose arms to further assess dose responses.  
Finally, the trial may terminate (outcome #5  listed above ) as a result of a low predictive probability 
of success (<0.05) given the da ta collected at the interim analysis.  
At the end of the study, for a trial that achieves efficacy success, the dose to be selected as the 
lowest effective dose is the ED80 dose, defined as the lowest dose that retains at least 80% of the 
largest treatment  effect, i.e.  
                                  (RED80 – Rplacebo ) ≥ (R maximum  – Rplacebo ) ×0.8,                                   (2)  
where R maximum  is the observed ovulation rate in the most effective dose arm, R placebo  is the observed 
ovulation rate in the placebo arm, and R ED80 is the observed ovulation rate in the selected dose arm.

confirmed pregnancy or at least one P 4 level ≥  6 ng/mL due to the P 4 levels never reaching this 
threshold, missing data, early withdrawal, or any other reason will be counted as not having 
ovulation (treatment failure).

The hypotheses are tested using a stratifie d one -sided Fisher’s exact test (Jung et al., 2014) in the 
FAS including the randomization scheme as the stratification factor. The SAS PROC FREQ with 
permutation -based Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test with exact p -value derived from all possible 
permutations  will be employed for the calculation of p -value for the stratified Fisher’s exact test. 
Jung has shown that the stratified Fisher’s exact test is equivalent to the exact stratified Mantel -

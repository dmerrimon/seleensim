2.0 BACKGROUND  
Liver malignancies, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), often arise in patients with cirrhosis, 
who exhibit significant variability in their liver function. The primary methods of assessing the 
severity of cirrhosis are clinical scoring systems such as the Child-Turcotte -Pugh (CTP) score or the 
Modified End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score.  The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
staging, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score, and the newest albuin-bilirubin (ALBI) 
grade have been proposed as a lternative  way s to assess the severity of liver dysfunction.  Patients 
with liver tumors  who need radiation may not be diagnosed with cirrhosis but may have significant 
alteration in their liver function due to prior chemotherapy or other local therapy.  The gold standard lab test for global liver function evaluation is indocyanine green rete ntion at 15 minutes (ICG15).  
However, one of the most clinically important limitations of all these tests is the lack of information 
that they provide regarding regional variations in hepatic function within the liver of an individual 
patient, which are i ncreasingly well described. Such regional variability can have important 
implications for radiation treatment (RT) planning, delivery, and outcome assessment in patients with liver cancer.  Recently, visualizing regional differences in hepatic function has  become possible with 
the development of imaging techniques using technetium -99m (Tc99m) hepatobiliary iminodiacetic 
acid (HIDA) scans, Tc99m galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA) scans, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) computed tomography (CT), DCE magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI), and 
functional MRIs (fMRIs) using contrast agents such as Eovist.  Theragnostic imaging is the 
application of quantitative information from imaging studies to guide therapeutic interventions. 
These technologies therefore may have important applications in RT for liver cancer as they can 
provide a “road map” for how to design radiation plans to avoid functioning liver. 
 
Hepatobiliary tumors globally are the fifth -most common cause of cancer and the second leading 
cause of cancer death. [1] In the [LOCATION_002] in 2015, there are expected to be 46,570 hepatobiliary 
malignancies  with  28,250 deaths.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of 
hepatobiliary tumor.  The primary risk factors for HCC are chronic hepatitis B and C infections, 
although cirrhosis of any cause increases the risk.  The rising incidence of hepatitis C has caused 
HCC to become one of the fastest -growing cancers in terms of incidence and death in North 
America. [1]  Surgical resection and liver transplantation offer the best outcomes, with 5-year overall 
survival (OS) rates of 50 -85%.[2 -5] Unfortunately, many  HCC patients are not candidates for 
surgical resection due to the presence of locally advanced disease or medical comorbidities.  In 
addition, only select patients with early stage HCC (tumors <5 cm) are candidates for liver 
transplantat ion.[6]   For patients who are not surgical candidates or who refuse surgery, a variety of 
nonsurgical treatment modalities are available, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial 
chemoembolization (TACE), radioembolization (Y -90), chemotherapy (primarily sorafe nib-based), 
and radiation therapy (RT).  TACE, RFA, and RT can be used as “bridging” therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330614].  However, to date, there have been no 
randomized trials comparing these modalities.  A discussion at a multidisciplinary tumor board 
where physicians from each respective specialty of surgery, interventional radiology, radiation oncology, hepatology, and radiology often determines which modality is pursued.  Similarly, the 
other hepatobiliary tumors, namely cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, are primarily tre ated 
with surgery if possible.  An additional indication for focal liver radiation therapy exists in patients 
with o ligometasta ses from certain primary malignanc ies, such as colon, lung, or breast cancer.  
Historically, the use of radiation in cancers of the liver was limited due to the risk of radiation-
induced liver disease (RILD), which is characterized by [CONTACT_330627] t ransaminase 
levels. No standard method of reversing RILD is known, and it can lead to fatal liver failure. The risk 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/[ADDRESS_408598] correlated with mean liver dose, reflecting the presence of a strong dose -volume 
correlation with the risk of RILD. Additionally, the l iver is considered a “parallel” organ that can be 
treated with ablative radiation doses as long as adequate reserve tissue is maintained.[7, 8]  Therefore, 
radiation therapy (RT) has gained an increasing role in the treatment of liver tumors given the 
development of highly conformal methods of delivery, including intensity modulated radiation 
therapy (IMRT), proton therapy, and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).  Unlike 
conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, where a treatment course is administered daily over the 
course of a few weeks, SBRT delivers highly focused radiation with s harp dose gradients over a 
shorter treatment course, usually 1 to 6 fractions.  Liver SBRT has been established as a safe and 
effective option in both liver metastases and HCC. [9-12] Rusthoven e t al treated patients with SBRT 
(54 Gy in 3 fractions) for liver metastases and found a 2- year local control (LC) rate of 93% and no 
grade 3 hematologic or hepatic toxicity.[9]  A phase I/II trial in HCC patients from Indiana University 
reported 2- year LC rates of 90%.[10]   The largest prospective phase I/II trial in HCC patients from 
Princess Margaret reported a 2- year LC rate of 74%, but 55% of these patients had vascular invasion, 
which is a poor prognostic factor.[12]   
Significant variability in liver function is present in the population of patients with liver tumors and 
cirrhosis .  Different models for grading the severity of cirrhosis are available, including the Child-
Turcotte -Pugh (CTP) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)  score .  To date, CTP score 
has been the preferred scoring system in evaluating patients for consideration of SBRT.  The re are 
other staging and prognostic scores for patients with HCC including the AJCC stage, BCLC stage, CLIP score , and ALIBI score .  The CTP score is based on the levels of bilirubin, albumin, and 
PT/INR; it also incorporates a subjective grading system for ascites and encephalopathy.  The range 
of scores is 5 to 15, with scores 5-6 classified as CTP A, 7 -9 CTP B, and 10- 15 CTP C.[13]   The risk 
of side effects has been suggested to increase with higher CTP scores.  In the study by [CONTACT_330628], 
75% of their patients had CTP A disease, and there were no grade 3 toxicities reported in their trial. 
[11]  One -third of patients in the phase I/II trial at Indiana University experienced grade 3 
hematologic or hepatic toxicity, although 17 out of 21 of those patients had pre -treatment grade 2 
dysfunction in that category.  In addition, there were 4 patients w ho had progressive liver 
dysfunction, 2 of whom went on to liver transplantation and the other 2 who died as a result of liver 
failure.  All 4 of these patients had CTP ≥B8, and 2 of those patients were treated with 42 Gy in 3 
fractions, which was conclude d to be unsafe in CTP B patients.[10]  
 
In addition to baseline liver dysfunction, many of the pati ents who are referred for liver SBRT have 
had prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330615], chemotherapy, RFA, TACE, or conventional radiotherapy, which can adversely affect liver function.  A recent retrospective study from Michigan 
comparing their institut ional experience of SBRT with RFA found that patients who were treated 
with SBRT were more likely to have received prior liver-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a median of 2 
treatments in SBRT patients compared to 0 in RFA patients.[14]   
We propose that, by [CONTACT_330629] , we 
will be able to identify correlations between radiation dose to the normal liver and the risk of RILD .  
An improved understanding of the relationship between radiation dose and the risk of liver toxicity 
will permit assessme nt of the risk of RILD before RT, thereby [CONTACT_330630], allowing appropriate patient selection and dose determination, and establishing a standard 
approach for theragnostically planned radiation therapy.   
Theragnostic imaging is a term coined by [CONTACT_330631].[15]   He proposes a technique which he calls 
“dose -painting by [CONTACT_15750],” suggesting that imaging techniques that can visualize areas that may 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  7 potentially be radioresistant such as hypoxic areas can serve as a map on which dose can be escalated 
to in a voxel to voxel manner.[16]   This protocol would apply the technique of theragnostic imaging 
in a new way.  We propose the idea of “dose -erasing by [CONTACT_15750]” to optimize our radiation dose 
away from areas of functional liver. In taking the regional variation of liver function into account, we 
propose that radiation plans designed in s uch a way that maximizes safety by [CONTACT_330632].  This protocol will aim to determine the clinical feasibility of applying such a technique in 
the clinic.   
Currently, standard constraints for liver SBRT planning stipulate that 700 cc of “uninvolved liver”, 
i.e., the volume of liver minus the gross tumor volume (GTV), should receive <15 Gy.  This 
constraint is derived from a phase I study conducted at the University of Colorado (which itself was 
based on surgical data showing that 75-80% of t he liver can be safely resected). [9, 17]   Since 25% of 
the assumed average liver volume  of 2000 cc is 500 cc, 700 cc was used as a conservative limit.  The 
basis for 15 Gy was that its BED is 40 Gy 3 which is less than the whole liver tolerance of 49.5 Gy 3 as 
determined from an early RTOG dose escalation study of whole liver RT.[18]   The current constraint 
does not take into account the functional residual capacity of the untreated liver. However, 
information about regional variations in liver function could help to evaluate the safety of RT in 
patients who are borderline candidates  for liver RT based on their liver function.  In this protocol, we 
will meet the standard physical constraints but plan to increase safety further by [CONTACT_330633]. 
The indocyanine green (ICG) retention study is presently the gold standard for assessing liver 
function, but this study only provides information about global liver function.[19]   An ICG retention 
at 15 minutes (ICG15) of less than 14% has historically been used as a cutoff to select patients for 
major hepatectomy, but subsequent trials have shown that well -selected patients with ICG15 values  
above this cutoff had similar outcomes as those with lower ICG15 values [20, 21]   According to the 
2016 NCCN hepatobiliary guidelines, ICG15 is widely used in Asia but not in Western countries.  
Two studies from the University of Michigan reported baseline I CG values in patients’  pre-treatment.  
They reported ICG clearance as ICG half -life, whereas the surgical data looks at ICG retention at 15 
minutes (ICG15).  In a total of 29 patients, the values ranged from 3.75 minutes to 14.5 minutes, which would correlate with an expected ICG15 of 6.25% to 48.8%.  In this study , 14 of 29 (48.3%) 
of patients would have had a ICG value >14%.  Clearly, the patients undergoing radiation therapy for liver tumors can have a large variation in their liver function.  Having more data as to what functional 
residual capacity correlates with the ability to safel y deliver radiation therapy would be beneficial.   
Alternative radiographic assessments of regional liver function, including t he hepatobiliary Tc99m -
iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) CT, DCE MRI, and fMRI with 
contrast agents  such as Eovist  are being explored.  These have been validated by [CONTACT_330634]. [22-26]   Unfortunately, direct comparisons of 
these modalities are complicated by a lack of uniformity in reporting of imaging data.  In addition, it 
is unknown how to best incorporate information derived from these studies in radiation treatment 
planning. 
HIDA scans have been evaluated in both the surgery and radiation therapy settings. In the surgical 
settin g, HIDA scans have been used in an effort to identify patients who are at higher risk for 
postoperative complications including liver failure and death. Much of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_330616] -operative evaluation has been done in the Netherlands.  A Dutch study 
reported that HIDA scans were effective in predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality; this 
report showed that a 2.5%/min/m
2 of body surface area (BSA) in the residual (non-resected) liver was 
the threshold value that predicted for postoperative liver failure.  Patients with a FRL uptake above 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  8 2.5%/min/m2 of BSA had a 3% chance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_330617]-failure 
related mortality, whereas patients with FRL uptake below 2.5%/min/m2 had a 56% chance of 
postoperative liver failure.  A recent update to these data gives 2.7%/min/m2 as the safe cutoff.  This 
study also demonstrated a weak but positive correlation (r=0.61) between HIDA scan values for 
predicting volume regeneration at [ADDRESS_408599] -resectio n.[27]   The University of Michigan has also 
evaluated the potential use of HIDA in radiation treatment planning.  They used a different 
parameter, the hepatic ejection fraction (HEF), and validated it with ICG.  They obtained HIDA scans pre -treatment, during tre atment (after 50 -60% of the planned dose had been delivered), and [ADDRESS_408600] dose through worse functioning portions of the liver may improve the safety of radiation 
delivery.[24]   The study from Michigan provides further validation of the HIDA scan as a reasonable 
surrogate for liver function.  
HIDA scans are a relatively inexpensive and simple imaging technique.  In patients undergoing liver 
resection, preoperative HIDA t hreshold values of >2.7% uptake/min/m
[ADDRESS_408601] been reported. Further work is needed to identify thresholds 
below which a given patient may be at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_330618]-induced liver di sease 
(RILD).   
 CT perfusion and MR perfusion have also been studied at the University of Michigan in a similar 
fashion to the HIDA analysis, with scans obtained pre -, during, and 1-month post -treatment in 
patients undergoing 3D conformal liver RT.  Both modalities were validated by [CONTACT_330635].  
The study evaluating CT perfusion defined a lower limit for portal vein perfusion (Fp) by 
[CONTACT_330636].  This value was Fp <20 mL/(100 g 100).  The 
dose that decre ased portal vein perfusion to 20 mL/(100 g min) for each patient ranged from 42.4 to 
67.8 Gy, indicating significant individual variations in radio sensitivity .  In 8 of 11 patients (73%), 
perfusion in the low dose regions increased post -treatment, suggest ing that such regions may be able 
to make up for perfusion that is lost in the higher-dose region.[22]   A companion MR perfusion study 
included patients treated with SBRT (n=5) and 3D conformal RT (n=12) and showed that on average, regional decreases in perfusion occurred at doses greater than 17 Gy.[23]   This correlated with the 
threshold for hepatic regeneration that was described previously, where it was also suggeste d that 
doses >23.9 Gy limited regenerative capacity.[28]   This study also demonstrated that pre -treatment 
and mid-treatment perfusion scans predicted [ADDRESS_408602] -treatment: one had a 40% improvement in ICG half -life 
from 10.25 minutes to 6 m inutes (estimated ICG15 36.3% to 17.7%) and the other had a stable ICG 
half-life of 14 minutes (estimated ICG15 47.5%).  In 5 of 17 patients who had scans 2 months after 
treatment, it appeared there was a recovery of perfusion to near the previous baseline in the lower 
doses but not in the higher doses.[23]   No threshold was given, but the dose appears to be in the 
range of 35- 40 Gy.  This is consi stent with studies done at the University of Colorado where the 
defined threshold for a significant change in Hounsfield units was -7 units; this change was 
correlated with a physical dose of 30-35 Gy, suggesting such areas are associated with scarred live r 
tissue. [29]   
The Michigan studies provide important data with respect to validating the role of advanced imaging 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  9 techniques in evaluating functional residual liver volume. T hese studies  also provide preliminary 
image -based information about the dose -response relationship of normal liver tissue. However, these 
studies were limited by [CONTACT_330637] -up period (only 
one month post treatment). T he HIDA parameter of HEF  which was studied at Michigan  has not 
been prospectively evalua ted as a predictor of worse clinical outcomes, unlike the % uptake/min/m2 
parameter, which is how HIDA scans are reported at our institution.  Finally, and perhaps most 
importantly, the prior HIDA studies provide no information on the correlation of imaging findings 
with post -treatment liver functio n tests, CTP score, or MELD.  An exploratory analysis to determine 
the correlation of functional imaging to liver regeneration and the standard scoring systems such as 
CTP or MELD  is planned.  
A Japanese study eva luated different MRI parameters from DCE MRI and their correlation with 
Tc99m galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA) scans, with validation using ICG.  Interestingly, they 
also correlated the different functional imaging studies with CTP score, a useful clinical parameter 
which none of the University of Michigan papers evaluated. GSA is a radiotracer specific for 
hepatocytes, binding to the asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor on the sinusoidal and lateral surfaces 
of hepatocytes.  It is similar to the HIDA sca n and is widely used in Asia, but GSA is currently not 
FDA approved in the [LOCATION_002].  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_330619] -plus -liver (LHL15) and percent of cumulative uptake from 15-16 
minu tes (LU15).  They found that the intracellular contrast uptake ratio (UR) from DCE MRI had 
correlations with the GSA scan parameters LHL15, LU15, CTP score, and ICG15. The weak 
correlation of UR with fibrosis trended toward significance.  A different MRI parameter, the 
extracellular volume (Ve), correlated with fibrosis, but was not found to have significant correlation 
to the GSA parameters, ICG15, or CTP score.  The authors  concluded that neither MRI nor GSA was 
the ‘correct’ method, and more work is needed to investigate what the most sensitive marker for liver 
function is.[30]   A secondary aim of the paper would be to correlate HIDA scan paramete rs with 
CTP score  as well as with different parameters from other imaging techniques such as diffusion-
weighted MRI.  We also plan to analyze if there is a correlation between these parameters and the 
regenerative capacity of the liver.  
In order to quantit ate the dosimetric improvements that theragnostically planned radiation will offer, 
we plan to analyze the plans using a functional dose -volume histogram.  Conventional dose -volume 
histograms assume that a given organ is homogeneously functioning and thus spatial and functional 
information is lost .  Functional dose -volume histograms were proposed as a technique to analyze 
radiation plans in the early 1990s by [CONTACT_330638].[31, 32]   
Since then, most of the work with regards to the use of functional DVH analysis has been done in 
lung cancer with single photon emission CT (SPECT) using 99Tc-labeled macroaggregatted albumin 
(MAA) perfusion imaging.[33, 34]   A group in [LOCATION_009] described a technique of using the SPECT 
scan to design an IMRT plan that was optimized to reduce the V20 to functional lung.  Their 
definition of functional lung was defined as 60% of the maximum uptake of the SPECT scan.[35]   
This definition of functional lung, while utilitarian, does not account for the heterogeneity that can 
exist from one patient to another as there is no standard “global lung function” upon which different 
patients’ scans can be normalized.  The HIDA scan technique provides a global liver function from 
which we can scale the regional function to know more quantitativel y rather than qualitatively how a 
given area of liver is functioning.  The only use of functional DVH use for analysis of liver radiation plans comes from a study in Japan where they were studying the use of GSA scans in liver radiation planning.  They ack nowledged the difficulty of defining a universal liver function.  They defined 
functional liver as uptake of liver greater than the HCC, while dysfunctional liver was up take similar 
to that of HCC.  Using this definition they found that if the V20 to func tional liver was <20% was 
associated with a <20% risk of deterioration in CTP score.[36]   These studies demonstrate the 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  10 feasibility of optimizing a radiation plan based on an individual patient’s functional map generated 
from an image.  The difficulty interpreting these studies is that a global organ function has not been 
clearly defined in a reproducible manner.  For example, the uptake of a HCC can vary from one 
patient to anot her.  Our technique of HIDA scan interpretation gives a reliable global liver function 
from which a given percentage of counts within the scan can be scaled to a quantitative value which can be compared from patient to patient.

 Exploratory Objectives  
1. To identify correlations between radiation dose to the normal liver and the risk of RILD .  
2. To determine the feasibility of incorporating functional liver MRI (i.e., fMRI which will be 
done via MRI with Eovist  contrast ) into theragnostic liver radiotherapy planning.    
3. To assess the rate of significant change in HIDA scans midway through treatment . 
 
 Primary Endpoint  
1. The functional reserve of liver will be calculated for both a plan that takes the HIDA scan into account and a plan that does not take this into account.  The functional reserve will 
be calculated by (number of counts outside 15 Gy isodose line / total number of counts within 
the liver) * global live r function.  
  
 Secondary Endpoint s 
1. The rate at which the theragnostically planned radiation plan is chosen as the actual treatment 
plan rather than the conventionally planned radiation plan .

Potential subjects  will be identified and recruited per the recommendation of surgeons, medical 
oncologists, tumor boards, Department of Radiation Oncology, recommendations from outside 
physicians , or self-referral. No advertisement wil l be used to recruit subjects. Patients who appear to 
be eligible for this trial will undergo the Informed Consent Process and be screened for eligibility 
utilizing the eligibility criteria. Eligible patients who complete the Informed Consent Process will be 
registered in the OnCore® database and assigned a subject  ID number. Regulatory files will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_330640]. Applicable regulatory documents must be completed and on file prior to registration of any subject s.

 Simulation Period  
After subjects have been found eligible and enrolled to this study, each subje ct will undergo CT 
simulation for SBRT treatment planning. Two radiation treatment plans will be created for each 
subject and compared. The plan which best spares functional liver while maintaining adequate target 
coverage  will be selected for each subject . Within [ADDRESS_408609] 
the following functional scans for enrollment:  
1. HIDA scan  
2. MRI with Eovist contrast (fMRI)  
 If a patient cannot obtain an MRI or refuses to undergo eovist MRI, the subject may be enrolled on 
the stu dy at the discretion of the principal investigator. 
 
 Radiation Treatment Period  
During radiation treatment, subject s will be seen at least once per week for clinical assessment that 
will include a limited physical exam and assessment of toxicity.  
 
Midw ay through radiation treatment , subjects  will have the following procedures:  
1. Laborator y Assessments (CBC with differential , CMP, INR)  for assessment of CTP, MELD, 
and ALBI scores.  
2. HIDA scan

7. HIDA scan   
 
9.[ADDRESS_408611]  will be 
evaluated by a dose -volume histogram to ensure SBRT constraints are met.  A functional DVH will 
also be analyzed in order to allow a comparison of the potential relative sparing of function tha t the 
plan in which the functional data was accounted for provides.  
 
In the HIDA -guided plan, the target will be identical and the dose to the target will not change 
compared with a conventionally planned SBRT plan. Tumor coverage will be equivalent between 
both plans . Although HIDA -guided SBRT planning may result in changes in the geometric beam 
arrangement and the relative weighting of beams in order to attempt to increase sparing of functional 
liver, HIDA -guided planning will not result in any changes to the delineated tumor target nor in the 
accepted level of dosimetric coverage of the tumor target itself.  
 
The HIDA scan will be “fused” (overlaid) over the patient’s treatment planning CT, and contours 
that delineate areas of differing liver functi on will be created. The first step in contouring is the 
delineation of the tumor. An example of this can be found in Figure 1 below. The tumor is shown as 
the turquoise -colored volume in the posterior right lobe, and the liver is indicated by [CONTACT_330641]. The HIDA scan data will then be utilized to create contours delineating areas of higher- and 
lower -functioning liver. The example in Figure 1 shows contours corresponding to liver function 
(i.e., % maximum uptake as depi[INVESTIGATOR_330622]. Here, 25%-50% max (green), 50 -75% max 
(yellow), 75- 90% max (orange), 90-100% max (red). In this case, the left lobe of the patient’s liver 
was providing the majority of her liver function.  Therefore, the HIDA scan suggests that the left lobe 
of the liver should be avoided, as segments 1-4 are shown to contribute more to liver function than the right lobe of the liver.  
 
Figure 1. HIDA -guided Contouring  
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  14  
 
Once the treatment targets and avoidance structures are contoured, the treatment planning process 
will beg in. Generally, SBRT plans use 8-10 beams arranged at various angles around the body. The 
use of multiple beams allows the weight of each beam to be varied in order to deliver a highly 
conformal radiation plan (i.e., a plan in which the prescription isodose  lines closely match the target 
contour). Figure 2 below demonstrates a treatment plan using the HIDA data which shows that  no 
beam would be  directed at the tumor from the left anterior oblique (LAO) angle (red arrow) in order 
to spare the large island of functional liver tissue in the left lobe.  Without the extra information 
provided by [CONTACT_330642], a non-theragnostically planned SBRT plan likely would have used a 
beam arrangement that did not avoid the area of functional liver tissue in question, thereby [CONTACT_330643].

[CONTACT_330644] 1 cm cranio -caudal ly and 0.5 cm radial ly, unless less motion can be 
documented on simulation scans.  
 
Contouring from the HIDA scan  
1. Based on the HIDA scan data, contours of relative functional liver will be created  based on  
the following thresholds of maximum intensity: 0- 25% maximum, 25-100% maximum, 50-
100% maximum, 75-100% maximum.  These structures will serve as avoidance structures in 
the design of radiation fields for theragnostic SBRT planning.  
 
Standard SBRT  
The standard SBRT prescription, planning, constraints, and treatment parameters are as follows:  
 
1. Prescription :  
3- or 5-fraction SBRT will be utilized in this study depending on clinical scenario.  It is 
recommen ded that subject s without cirrhosis or with CTP A  disease  are treated with 3 
fractions and those with CTP B cirrhosis are treated with 5 fractions.  The d ose range  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_330624] 4000-5400 cGy delivered over 3-5 fractions.

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR EVALUATION/REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
Every subject should be encouraged to remain in the study. Possible reasons for early withdrawal may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
1. Withdrawal of consent – Subject decides to withdraw from the study. This  decision must be 
an “independent decision” that is documented in the source documentation. 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  19 2. Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or treating physician discretion – The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
treating physician may choose to withdraw a subject from the study i f there are safety or 
other concerns.  
3. Subject becomes pregnant. 
4. Subject non- compliance.  
5. Subject lost to follow -up. 
6. Subject death.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_408619] one month follow -up 
information available. Although Child -Turcotte -Pugh A and Child-Turcotte -Pugh B7 patients are 
both included, they will not be analyzed separately.    
The next possible step would be a Phase I trial that incorporates the data from HIDA - and functional 
MRI-guided radiation planning in order to permit dose escalation in liver SBRT as well as the 
treatment of patients with poor liver function, who are not currently SBRT candidates.  As the 
technique of functionally guided radiation has not been previously used in the treatment of liver 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  20 tumors, a 5% relative improvement in functional reserve of the liver will be considered as beneficial.  
If the use of HIDA scans shows beneficial functional  reserve of the liver in at least 3 of 15 of the 
subjects, this will help encourage further study on the use of HIDA scans for planning.  If the true rate of HIDA in improving functional reserve by 5% is at least 30% or higher, we will have 87% 
probability  detecting it with this rule: 
   
True probability HIDA is better 
than conventional plan by 5%  .[ADDRESS_408620] 3 
where HIDA is better  0.18 0.60 0.76 0.87 0.97 ≥0.[ADDRESS_408621]  characteristics will be tabulated, such as demographics (age, race, gender), and 
disease characteristics (Child -Turcotte -Pugh score, functional liver assessments). 
Significant protocol violations such as with respect to eligibility criteria and treatment plan will be tabulated.  
 
 Analysis of Primary Objective  
The efficacy set will be used for all the efficacy analysis, unless otherwise noted.  For the primary 
endpoint of difference of func tional reserve of liver, the value will be calculated for each subject  and 
described by [CONTACT_330646]. The summary statistics will be displayed overall and by [CONTACT_330647].   
 
 Analysis of Secondary Objective s 
The rate at which the plan that utilized the HIDA scan is chosen for the actual treatment will be 
summarized along with the corresponding exact 95% Binomial confidence interval. 
 
For Local Control, PFS, OS , time to transplant,  time to distant liver failure, and time to salvage 
treatment,  the median and the corresponding two- sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Estimates and 95% confidence intervals will also be provided for [ADDRESS_408622] blood tests  and CTP score will be 
calculated and summarized.  Additionally, all safety data will be listed.  For the treatment -emergent 
AEs, namely AEs started or worsened during the on -treatment period, the incidence will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_5379]/or preferred term, severity based on CTCAE grades, type of 
adverse event and the relation to the study drug. Deaths reportable as SAEs and non-fatal serious 
adverse events  will be listed by  [CONTACT_330648]. This will be done with the 
safety set.  
 
Changes in liver volume in the treated and untreated segments will be summarized by [CONTACT_330646].  
 
 Analysis of Exploratory Objectives  
To assess t he correlation between the radiation dose and the risk of RILD, graphs and descriptive 
statistics will be used to see if any relationships may exist. 
 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  21 Spearman’s correlations will be used to compare output from each of the HIDA and fMRI scans to 
see if any  measures correlate to each other . 
 
To assess significant change in HIDA and fMRI scans, the plan based off the HIDA scan done at 
mid-therapy would be re -optimized, retrospectively. The proportion of patients who have a change in 
the regional distribution of function after the initial radiation treatments will be determined.  If this 
re-optimized plan reduces the functional liver exposed to <15 Gy by 5% or more, this would be 
considered significant and will provide a potential idea about the feasibility of potential adaptive 
radiotherapy.   
 
 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis will be performed for this study.

17.0 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENT S 
 
 Definitions of Adverse Events 
 
17.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject , not necessarily having a causal relationship with the 
study. An adverse event (AE) can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study, whether or not related 
to the study.  
 
17.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence resulting in one or more of the 
following:  
1) Results in death or ANY death occurring within 28 days of date of study intervention (even if it is not felt to be study related)  
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  23 2) Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refe r to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe)  
3) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ≥ 24 hours or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
o NOTE : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85265]:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281785] p rior to first study intervention 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330625] 24 hours  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition unrelated to 
the study intervention 
4) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5) Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
6) Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject  or may require intervention (e.g., medical, 
surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). 
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm ; blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
17.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event not associated as a known risk or adverse event.  
 Determining Attribution to the Inves tigational Procedure  
Attribution: An assessment of the relationship between the AE and the study intervention. CTCAE 
does not define an AE as necessarily “caused by a therapeutic intervention”. After naming and 
grading the event, the clinical investigator must assign an attribution to the AE using the following 
attribution categories:  
  
Relationship  Attribution  Description  
Unrelated to investigational agent/intervention Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related  
Related to investigational agent/intervention Possible  The AE may be related  
Probable  The AE is likely related  
Definite  The AE is clearly related  
 
 Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded from the time of first study intervention and throughout the follow up period. All AEs considered related to the study intervention will be followed until 
resolution, return to baseline, or deemed clinically insignificant, even if this occurs post -study. Any 
death occurring within [ADDRESS_408625] be reported as an SAE 
regardless of attribution.  
17.3.1 Reporting to the IRB:  
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  24 1. Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported promptly to the 
IRB if they:  
• Unexpected;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
• Suggests  that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was 
previously known or recognized.   
 
If the serious adverse event does not meet all three (3) criteria listed above, the event does not have to be promptly reported to the Indiana University IRB.  However, it should be reported at the time of 
continuing review  
 
2. Prompt reporting of unanticipated problems to the IRB is defined as within 5 days from 
becoming aware of the event. 
 
17.3.2 Reporting to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC):  
Regardless of study sponsorship, this study is subject to monitoring by [CONTACT_330654] (DSMC). The DSMC chair and/or coordinator 
will review all expedited SAE reports through OnCore®. Expedited reports are completed per IRB 
guidelines and may include the IRB prompt reporting form, non -compliance form, AdEERS reports, 
MedWatch, and additional SAE forms  as required by [CONTACT_456]. Submission of this information to 
the DSMC is additional to any other protocol -specified regulatory bodies (e.g., FDA, pharmaceutical 
company) to be notified. When follow -up information is received, a follow -up report should al so be 
created in OnCore®. The DSMC chair and/or coordinator will review expedited SAE reports 
monthly and report findings to the DSMC quarterly.

At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non -measurable as follows  
 
Measurable Lesions:  
Tumor lesions – Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane 
of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_408630] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesi ons which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable)  
• [ADDRESS_408631] X -ray 
Malignant lymph nodes:  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_408632] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short  axis will be measured and followed.   
 
Non-measurable Lesions: 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly 
non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pl eural or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/ 
abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_330656]. 
 
Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” lesions  
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and me asured at baseline.  This means if a patient 
has only one or two organ sites involved, a maximum of two and four lesions, respectively, will be recorded.  
  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs and should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next  largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  
 
Lymph nodes  
Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_408633] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial 
plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these 
measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20mm·x 
30mm ha s a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 
20mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes tha t have a short axis <10 
mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  28 Sum of Diameters  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reporte d as the baseline sum diameters .  As noted above, if lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.   
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-
target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these 
lesions should be  followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’.  In 
addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item 
on the case report form (e.g., ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’  or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
 
Special notes on assessment of target  lesions  
 
Lymph nodes : 
Target lesion lymph nodes should always have the short axis measurement recorded (measured in the 
same anatomical plane as the baseline exam), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm.  Thus, when 
lymph nodes are included as target l esions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete 
response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis < [ADDRESS_408634] achieve a short axis 
<10mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the 
sum of target lesions.  
 
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’:  
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, sometimes 
lesions or lymph nodes become so faint  on CT scan that the radiologist may report them as ‘too small 
to measure ’. When  this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is Response  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in 
short axis  to < 10 mm)  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
sum diameters while on study.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the  smallest on study). In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  NOTE: 
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.  
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/[ADDRESS_408635] that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be 
recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, 
a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (derived from 5 mm slice thickness).  Note: It is less 
likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when 
normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_12156]; however, if a lymph 
node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5mm 
should be assigned in this circumstance as well. However, if the radiologist is able to provide an 
actual measurement, it should be recorded even if it is below 5 mm.  
 
Lesion s that split or coalesce on treatment:  
When non-nodal lesion ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added 
together to calculate the target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may 
be maintained t hat would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  
If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest 
diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Response  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response 
(CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 
10 mm short axis)  
Non-CR/ Non-PD  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease 
(PD)  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing  non-target lesions  
 
Special notes on assessment of progression of non-target disease  
 
When the patient also has measurable disease  
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of 
therapy. A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-targ et lesions is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis 
of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare. 
 
When the patient has only non-measurable disease  
This circumstance arises in some phase III trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have 
measurable disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance 
there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-
measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by 
[CONTACT_108]: if all lesions are truly non -measurable) a useful test that  can be applied when assessing 
patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on 
the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for m easurable disease: i.e., an increase in tumor burden representing an 
additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable 
lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in 
IUSCC- 0604 
 
7/9/2020         Page  30 lymphangitic disease from localised to widespread, or may be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to 
require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be considered to 
have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-
measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore t he 
increase must be substantial  
 
New Lesions  
There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, 
change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for 
example, some  ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). This is 
particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For 
example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report a s a ‘new’ cystic lesion, 
which it is not.  
 
A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is 
considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals 
metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not 
have brain imaging at baseline.  
 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a 
new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
 
Evaluation of best overall response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started).  The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both 
target and non-target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.

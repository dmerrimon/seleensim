Number of Site(s)  One investigative site in the US with subject activities conducted via a decentralized/remote method.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of clinical depression among US adults has more than tripled since the COVID-19 pandemic began (Czeisler et al., 2020). The U.S. is in the midst of an unprecedented mental health crisis, and the American public requires treatment options that are effective, safe, and efficiently delivered to patients. There was a large, unmet clinical need for treatment of depression before COVID-19, and there will continue to be such a need after the pandemic is brought under control.   There are significant gaps in the delivery of care to patients suffering from depression. In the U.S., the majority of patients with depression who are treated with antidepressant medication receive their prescription not from a board-certified psychiatrist, but from their primary care physician. These clinicians are usually not responsible for making psychiatric diagnoses, and do not formally monitor side effects or evaluate response (Mann, 2011).

This reality of the U.S. mental healthcare system means that Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES), as a low risk, home-based intervention, provides a potentially clinically important benefit for treating patients with depression.   Beginning approximately twenty years ago, new, effective forms of neuromodulation became available, some of which the FDA has reviewed for clinical use, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). In the case of CES, which was already commercially available with long track records of safety, a number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_448998] a substantial amount of anecdotal evidence supported safety and effectiveness. The development of new neuromodulatory treatments greatly increased interest in the clinical potential of all forms of neurostimulation to treat depression. Scientific and clinical interest also re-focused on older methods of therapy, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which, like CES, delivers alternating current, albeit ECT delivers an exponentially higher dose of electrical stimulation designed to cause a seizure and thus requires anesthesia to administer. The Fisher Wallace Stimulator delivers a low dose of pulsed alternating current which is comfortable and safe to self-administer and is intended to be used by [CONTACT_833284] a day to treat depression.   In recent years, animal and clinical research on CES for alleviating depression has increased, and it has been found that higher frequencies can overcome the impedance of the human skull (Mindes, 2015). Neurophysiological effects have been studied using concurrent brain magnetic resonance imaging  (Ghobadi-Azbari, 2020) and electroencephalography (EEG) (Merlet, 2013; Miniussi, 2012). Computational modeling (Datta, 2013 a, b; Khadka, 2020) of stimulation effects using models of electrical behavior in tissues of the head, skull and brain provides additional data suggesting that stimulation may have beneficial impact.   CES is a low-cost, non-invasive, wearable form of low intensity neural stimulation that has been used clinically for over 100 years (Mindes, 2015). This body of evidence from use of CES, and comparison with other neuromodulation methods, indicate that CES is a safe form of neural stimulation that causes minimal side effects. This large body of evidence also suggested possible benefits of regular CES for a range of neuropsychiatric indications, including depression.  The Fisher Wallace Stimulator was cleared by [CONTACT_833285], anxiety and insomnia in [ADDRESS_1157106] physiological effects on the brain, and that those effects are consistent with CES alleviating depression.  This study will leverage the opportunities and efficiencies of the telehealth environment to investigate the benefits of CES for adults with moderate to severe MDD. In doing so, the study will more accurately represent the real-world experience of patients using CES, as CES devices are typi[INVESTIGATOR_833263], and more psychiatric care is being provided via telemedicine.  This prospective, fully remote, randomized, controlled, triple-blind study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FW-200 self-administered Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) in adults with moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).  3  INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  3.1  INTENDED USE  The Fisher Wallace Stimulator FW-200 is a non-invasive medical device intended to treat adult patients with moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The FW-200 is a prescription device for use at home by [CONTACT_15613] a medical professional, though the device may also be used in a professional health care setting or extended care facility.   3.2  POPULATIONS AND INDICATIONS FOR WHICH THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE IS INTENDED    The indicated use is Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation in adults (ages 21-65 years) for 20 minutes twice daily, upon waking for the day and at bedtime, to reduce symptoms of moderate to severe MDD.  3.3  DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  The FW-200 is a fixed output version of the commercially available FW-100 which has variable output. Whereas the commercially available FW-100 is able to deliver output at four different Levels, 1-4, the FW200 only outputs at Level 2.   The FW-200 device consists of the following components (also refer to figures below):  ● CES device controller  ● Electrode receptacle with sponge  ● Electrode lead wires (red and black)  ● Sponges 4-pack  ● Velcro headband  ● Carry case  ● User guide  ● AA batteries

The sponge electrodes, as well as the scalp and hair beneath the electrodes, must be wet for electrode conductivity to occur. New headsets are provided with pre-installed sponges in the white plastic sponge receptacles. The sponges provided are dehydrated and will expand when wet.  After snappi[INVESTIGATOR_833264], patients must saturate the sponges with water. The electrode sponges should be replaced every two weeks, or if they become stained or appear degraded in any way.  The patient places the headband on the head so that it sits above the eyebrows. The wet electrodes, in the receptacles with attached wires, are placed beneath the headband, above the sideburns. The bottom of the electrode should be in line with the top of the ear. The physiological location of electrode placement is the squamous temporal bone above the very posterior part of the zygomatic arch.    Once the wet sponge electrodes are placed securely beneath the headband, with wires connected, the device is turned on by [CONTACT_833287]. The dial is rotated counterclockwise to go from the OFF to ON position (there is a click when the dial is rotated to ON). The green ON light should illuminate and the first and second (Level #2) yellow indicator lights should also flashes yellow, indicating Level #[ADDRESS_1157107] his/her head to expel more water, or rewet the sponges or tighten the headband.

Although the dial does show four levels, all settings will administer Level #[ADDRESS_1157108].  Study subjects will use the device twice daily: once for 20 minutes after waking up for the day and once again for 20 minutes before going to bed.  3.3.1 ACCESSORIES  The FW-200 is provided as a complete kit. For any device replacement needs (lead wires, sponge receptacles, sponge pack or headband), a new complete kit will be shipped.   3.3.2 CONDITIONS OF USE  Users will be provided instructions regarding the conditions of this use.  The environment where the system is used should be one that has the following operating conditions:  ● Temperature range: 41 to 95℉ (5 to 40℃)  ● Relative humidity range: 10% to 93%, non-condensing    Do not allow water to enter the device. The Fisher Wallace Stimulator® should not be exposed to environmental conditions where the system may get wet. Operation in close proximity (e.g., within 1m) to a shortwave or microwave therapy equipment may reduce the output performance of the device.  Keep the device out of reach of children. Electronic monitoring equipment such as ECG monitors and ECG alarms may not operate properly when CES stimulation is in use. High frequency surgical equipment may not be used when CES stimulation is in use. This device is not suitable for use with oxygen or in the presence of a flammable anesthetic mixture with air or oxygen, or with nitrous oxide.  3.3.3 CLEANING THE DEVICE  The device and headset require cleaning for reuse. Reference the User Guide for the cleaning instructions. Investigative staff and subjects will be trained on the cleaning process during device handling training.  3.3.4 SIGNAL FORMS  Both the monopolar waveforms in the FW-200 will make use of three frequencies: 1) 15 kHz; 2) 15 Hz; and 3) 500 Hz. The 15 kHz frequency refers to the carrier frequency. The 500Hz frequency controls the on and off times of the carrier. The 15Hz frequency controls the polarity reversal of the combined 15kHz and 500Hz signals. The voltage amplitude of the output signal is the same for both polarities. The combined voltage amplitude will be twice the monopolar form.

This is done with a fixed voltage and a resistive feedback circuit called the Constant Current Controller. Users should be receiving approximately 2 mA peak-to-peak (in the monopolar scheme) and 4 mA peak-to-peak (in the bipolar scheme).  V oltage and current are directly related to each other by [CONTACT_833288] (in this case the human head). Therefore, a constant current controller was needed to address the variability in the resistance of the human head. The constant current controller adjusts its own resistance so that the human head plus the controller will produce a fixed current for the Output voltage. At a resistance of 100 Ohms, the voltage output is approximately 400 mV . At 200 Ohms, the voltage output is double, approximately 800 mV .  The average current output relates to the modulation of the signal. If the voltage was applied constantly, the average current would be 2mA because it is being modulated the average current is reduced by [CONTACT_833289]: 50% due to the 15kHz on/off carrier modulation; 50% due to the 500Hz on/off modulation of the carrier and 75% due the off time between the 15Hz polarity reversal.   That provides an average current of 0.375 mA.  3.3.6 ELECTRONICS/CONTROLLER  Figure [ADDRESS_1157109] Assembly (PCBA). The batteries provide power for the entire system operation.  The microcontroller (MCU) takes input from the Dip Switch and a Rotary switch. In turn, it controls the light emitting diodes (LEDs) and the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) Analog Switch. The MCU will also power the LEDs to visually affirm that the device is on. The V oltage Regulator takes power from the Batteries and increases the voltage for the output circuitry. The Microcontroller produces the three frequencies and modulates the Output using the CMOS Analog Switch. The Analog Switch is able to both turn on and off the voltage as well as swap the Output’s polarity. The Constant Current Controller maintains current through the Output by [CONTACT_2224] a resistive feedback circuit. This circuit varies its own resistance so that 2mA is maintained even if there are differences at the output.  The Microcontroller will drive the Buzzer to indicate the end of the session.

Passing results were achieved.    4.2  SUMMARY OF CLINICAL STUDIES  To examine the safety and effectiveness of the Fisher Wallace Stimulator, Model FW- 200, for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed in a fully remote fashion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects with either mild, moderate, or severe major depressive disorder were enrolled in the study. Throughout the treatment period, participants administered twice daily 20-minute treatments with either the active device or a sham device treatment. Participants were randomized into immediate or delayed treatment arms. In the immediate treatment arm, participants administered active treatment (20 minutes of clinical stimulation per treatment session) for 8 weeks. Participants in the delayed treatment arm received sham stimulation (two seconds of clinical stimulation and 19 minutes and 58 seconds of zero stimulation per treatment session) for 4 weeks, before being unblinded. At that point, participants were crossed over to active treatment for the following 4 weeks.  Participants completed reports of compliance with treatment, as well as assessments of symptoms and side effects throughout the study, particularly at weeks 2, 4, and 8. Physician assessments were performed prerandomization and at 4 weeks.  The primary outcome measure was change in Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) score from baseline to week 4 in immediate versus delayed treatment arms. The BDI-II is a widely used selfreported instrument to assess the severity of depression in adolescents and adults from different cultural groups and populations (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition | The National Child Traumatic Stress

Secondary outcome measures included: change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale from baseline to week 4, change in BDI-II from baseline to week 2, change in BDI-II from week 4 to 8, change in Patient Health Questionnaire-8 from baseline to week 2 and week 4, as well as safety and tolerability as measured by [CONTACT_833290] (SAFTEE).  This study enrolled 275 participants with 137 participants in the Immediate Treatment arm and 138 participants in the Delayed Treatment arm. Of these, 83 participants in the Immediate Treatment arm and 78 participants receiving delayed treatment completed 4-week assessments.  Table 1 provides the percentages of side effects experienced by [CONTACT_833291] 4. Table 2 displays the percentages of patient-reported side effects at Week 8. There were no reported serious adverse events. Overall, more adverse events were reported in the Delayed Treatment arm than the Immediate Treatment arm.

This decrease of greater than ten points is indicative of antidepressant effectiveness.  More than 40% of the patients had a decrease of 50% in BDI-II or more. Due to high levels of placebo response, the between group difference in BDI-II change was -0.8 (p = 0.496). Significantly, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_833265]-II during the first four weeks in the sham arm, the switch to active treatment was associated with additional improvement (BDI-II decrease from week 4 to 8 of 3.6 points) beyond what they had experienced during the first four weeks, while the Immediate Treatment arm only showed minimal additional improvement in this period (BDI-II decrease of 0.6 points, p < 0.01), representing an improvement of more than 15% from BDI-II scores from the end of the sham period. Thus, the data demonstrate the effectiveness of the FW-200 in treating depression.  5  BENEFITS AND RISKS OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE, CLINICAL PROCEDURE AND CLINICAL INVESTIGATION  5.1  ANTICIPATED CLINICAL BENEFIT  Participation in this study may treat moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder in adults (ages 21-65).  Knowledge gained from this study may enable future patients to benefit from CES.  5.2  POTENTIAL ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS  Potential anticipated adverse events are those that may occur in association with a CES treatment, including those AEs listed below that are known risks from clinical experience/use of the FW-200 and similar CES devices (Federal Register :: Neurological Devices; Reclassification of Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulator Devices Intended To Treat Anxiety and/or Insomnia; Effective Date of Requirement for Premarket Approval for Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulator Devices Intended To Treat Depression, n.d.).   Risks associated with CES and CES devices include:  ● Skin irritation  ● Headaches  ● Dizziness  ● Electrical shocks and burns  The FW-200 is contraindicated for patients with the following:   ● Demand or sensing type pacemakers, or any other form of implanted electronics  ● Known heart disease  ● A poor reaction to the idea of electrical stimulation of any kind  ● Skin irritation around either electrode site  ● The device should not be used around the Carotid sinus

There was a low rate of adverse events in prior research with the FW-200.  The FW-200 may reduce the risk of moderate to severe MDD in adults. A prior study of the FW-200 in adults with mild, moderate, and severe MDD demonstrated very low risk of the device itself, in addition to a trend towards improvement in MDD symptoms by [CONTACT_5875] 2 of device usage.    Based upon review of the risk measures taken with the device and the results of prior studies with the FW200, as well as the risk mitigation measures in the protocol, and consideration of the potential benefits to study subjects or future patients, the risk/benefit profile for the FW-200 is considered acceptable and justifies conducting this study.

A two-week time point for the primary endpoint offers the ability to detect an acute change in patient status with use of the FW-200, which may be an advantage over other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For example, pharmacological treatment can require titration to a full therapeutic dose, which may depend on individual patient characteristics, including the patient’s age, treatment setting, comorbidities, concomitant pharmacotherapy, or specific medication side effects, all which may lead to a lengthy titration process. Psychotherapy approaches require a similar tailored approach. Guidelines note that for both pharmacological and psychotherapy approaches may require 4 to 8 weeks of treatment (Gelenberg, 2010).  Secondary endpoints include: Change in BDI-II scores at one and four weeks compared to baseline, change in PHQ-9 and QIDS-SR scores at one week, two weeks, and four weeks compared to baseline, and BDI-II responder rate (i.e., % of subjects with a 50% or better improvement in score from baseline) at four weeks. The PHQ-9 is a validated tool for assessing depression severity and response to treatment (Nida, n.d.) The QIDS-SR has been demonstrated to be a valid measure of depression symptom severity in both research and clinical settings (Rush et al., 2003). The secondary endpoints of BDI-II at one and four weeks plus the BDIII responder rate at four weeks aim to provide additional evidence of effectiveness over additional time points.

Pre-screening questions will include inclusion/exclusion criteria, demographics, medical history, and concomitant medications. Candidate subjects will also take the BDI-II and PHQ-[ADDRESS_1157120] questions from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) will also be required. The ePRO will be programmed to determine if the candidate’s answers meet eligibility criteria for the study. If not, the candidate will be notified via email or SMS text that they are not suitable for study participation. If the candidate meets pre-screening eligibility, the ePRO will notify the candidate via email or SMS text that a member of the investigational staff will be in contact [CONTACT_833294].

Additional training may be provided to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_833267], NAMSA, or the Sponsor as needed.   This study is prospective, randomized, sham controlled study, triple blinded for the subject, Principal Investigator, and Sponsor. Randomization provides a level of protection against bias as it tends to balance all confounders, both measured and unmeasured. Pre-specified endpoints and analysis plans, with a statistically powered sample size further minimize the potential for bias. The planned two-week lead-in period to establish a stable baseline should minimize bias due to regression to the mean.   7.[ADDRESS_1157125] Selection  Subjects will need to meet all the following inclusion criteria:    1.

They will also be presented with an information privacy policy which they must confirm they agree with prior to submitting responses for investigative staff review.      Interested participants will complete the following pre-screening assessments in ePRO:   ● Eligibility questions pertaining to Inclusion/Exclusion criteria (includes medical history and concomitant medications)  ● Demographics  ● BDI-II  ● PHQ-9  ● Questions from M.I.N.I.  The website will inform the potential subject if they are a potential candidate for the study based on their initial answers.   [IP_ADDRESS] Demographics  The candidate subject will provide the following demographic information: self-identified gender, biological sex, age, race, and ethnicity.   [IP_ADDRESS] BDI-II  To assess severity of depression, the potential subject will answer this 21-question multiple-choice selfreport inventory.

If not, the investigative staff will inform the candidate that they are no longer able to be considered for the study. If the change does not cause the candidate to fail pre-screening, the investigative staff will make the change in ePRO and enter a reason for change in ePRO as well. The ePRO includes an audit history to display changes to reported data, the author of the change, and the date/time when the change was saved.   If the candidate agrees to learn more about the study, the study staff member will perform the informed consent process. Investigative staff will also ask the candidate to confirm that the data collected during the pre-screening process can be used for study screening and evaluation purposes. If the candidate subject does not consent to study participation or to the use of their pre-screening data, the candidate will be deemed a pre-screen failure. All pre-screening data for that candidate will not be saved in ePRO for the study. If the candidate subject signs the informed consent form and allows the use of their pre-screening data for the study, the candidate will advance to study enrollment.   [IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent  The investigative team will introduce the potential participant to the clinical investigation by [CONTACT_833300], procedures, and participation requirements.   If the potential participant is interested in participating, the study staff will review the informed consent form. This will include describing the clinical investigation, potential discomforts, risks, and benefits of participation. The potential subject will have sufficient time to decide whether they wish to participate in this clinical investigation.   Any queries that the potential participant may have regarding this clinical investigation will be addressed appropriately by [CONTACT_20685].  Potential subjects will be instructed that they are free to obtain further information from the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_833268].  If the potential participant is willing to participate in the clinical investigation, he/she must read, understand and sign the informed consent form. The informed consent form will be sent to the potential subject electronically via a validated signature [CONTACT_833315]. The potential subject will be asked to complete the electronic signature [CONTACT_833316]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_833269].

The mathematical statement of the null and alternative hypothesis for primary endpoint is:  Ho: B2 ≤ 0   Ha: B2 > 0 where B2 represents the regression coefficient from the linear model corresponding to study arm, parameterized so a regression coefficient greater than zero represents a greater mean change for the treatment group compared to the control group. The general form of the linear model for each endpoint is:  ΔY = B0 + B1Y0 B2*X  where ΔY is the change in outcome from baseline at week 2, B0 is the intercept term, B1 is the coefficient for the subject’s baseline value Y0, and X is the treatment group indicator (1 = treatment, 0 = sham). Multiple imputation will be employed to address missing data.   Study success will be based on successful rejection of the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint.  Subgroup analysis will be provided based on sex and race as well as potentially other baseline factors, including baseline BDI-II score.   8.4  SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL AND POWER OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AND OVERALL STATISTICAL TESTING STRATEGY  The primary endpoint analysis will be performed at the one-sided 0.025 alpha level. Any other p-values and confidence intervals will be based on a nominal two-sided 0.05 alpha level (or equivalently a one-sided 0.025 alpha level as appropriate) without adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Anticipated potential AEs that may be encountered in the conduct of this study including potential AEs related to the use of the FW-[ADDRESS_1157165] DETAILS    In case of an immediately reportable adverse event (UADE), contact [CONTACT_1034]:   Gordon Levites, Quality Assurance Manager  [PHONE_17374] [EMAIL_15844]   16 VULNERABLE POPULATIONS  ISO [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_1157166] as an individual whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly influenced by [CONTACT_162161], whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation or of retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. Individuals who suffer from Major Depressive Disorder would be considered a vulnerable population and therefore included within this clinical investigation.    These vulnerable subjects according to the ISO [ZIP_CODE] definition will be asked to provide their informed consent if they are capable of providing it themselves and the consent process will be performed without undue delay. Informed consent processes shall be conducted according to national law and IRB procedures.  The protection of the rights and welfare of study participants will be overseen by [CONTACT_833312].  17 SUSPENSION OR PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION  17.1 CRITERIA FOR SUSPENSION OR PREMATURE TERMINATION  The clinical study may be stopped at any time at the Sponsor’s discretion.  In addition, further recruitment in the study may be stopped due to insufficient compliance with the protocol, GCP-related issues, and/or other applicable  regulatory requirements, procedure-related problems, lack of enrollment, or if the number of subject discontinuations for administrative reasons is deemed too high.

• Study Title:  
Intraoperative surgical wound infiltration vs Quadratus Lumborum (QL) Block for post -operative pain 
control after nephrectomy in living donor kidney transplant patients.  
• Short Title:  
Surgeon infiltration QL block comparison  
• R esearch Abstract:  
The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a difference between surgical site infiltration 
of local anesthetic versus ultrasound- guided truncal block ( Quadratus Lumborum, QL block).Current 
practice at Duke is to infiltrate local anesthetic at the end of surgery by [CONTACT_153744] a 
member of the regional anesthesia division to provide a QL block.   
Given that the administration of a QL block utilizes ultrasound to target a specific anatomical plane 
where the nerves pro viding sensation to the abdominal wall travel, we hypothesize that this approach 
will provide superior analgesia and improved morbidity when compared to direct injection of local 
anesthetic to the wound site.   
We will utilize patients undergoing living don or nephrectomies since these are heavily screened and 
understood to be in excellent health thus eliminating potential confounding variables. These patients 
will be followed for 7 days after surgery and data will be collected pertaining to their total opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023], pain scores, GI complications, and ability to return to normal pre -surgery physical function 
levels.   
Both parametric and non -parametric data will be analyzed with the appropriate statistical tests. Patients 
risks will be the same as for pat ients undergoing donor nephrectomy who are not participating in the 
study.  
• P rimary Objectives:  
The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a difference between surgical site infiltration 
of local anesthetic versus ultrasound -guided truncal block ( Quadratus Lumborum, QL block). Specifically 
comparing total 24h opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].   
• Secondary Objectives:  
The exploratory objectives are:  
 - Pain scores at which other time  points post surgery - hourly for the first four hours, at 6 hours, 12 hours , 24 hours, and     
- GI complications (bloating, nausea/vomiting, constipation)  
- Total use of PRN pain medication for a total of [ADDRESS_177379] surgery.

• Background & Significance: 
In 2014 in the [LOCATION_002] there were approximately 17,107 kidney transplants performed 
(https://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/factsheets/Organ -Donation -and-Transplantation -Stats). Of 
these a portion, approximately 6,000, were from living donors. Currently there is no consensus on the 
perioperative pain management strategies for these patients . Given the recent national attention to the 
ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_153730] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_153731]. 
Such strategies have been shown to decrease hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153732]. Use of local anesthetics during surgery is a strategy currently utilized 
to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. In this study we aim at answering the question of whether direct wound 
infiltration of local anesthetic by [CONTACT_153745] U/S guided Quadratus 
Lumborum regional block. 
            The Quadraus Lumborum block was described by [CONTACT_153746]. Al. [ADDRESS_177380] to provide analgesia to 
truncal/intraabdominal procedures.   Relatively recent case reports and studies have shown it to be an 
effective post- operative analgesic option for abdominal surgery  2-4. Patients undergoing donor 
nephrectomies here at Duke Medical Center are already receiving liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_153733] .This study will simply utilize the already existing infrastructure to formally investigate if one 
technique provides better pain control. We hypothesize the ultrasound guided QL block with lipo somal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_153734] -operative analgesia than surgical field wound infiltration, using 
decreased [ADDRESS_177381]-operatively, GI complications (bloating, 
nausea/vomiting, constipation) as well as improved functionality of basic motor activities such as 
walking. 
            Ultimately, we feel that those patients who stand to gain the most benefit from this new 
intervention will be the kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. However, given that this population tends to have 
high co -morbidities, which may confound our findings, we have elected to initially carry out this study 
on living kidney donors. These patients undergo rigorous selection and are thus a population with low to 
no co -morbidities and in generally healthy state. Such a population would be ideal to elucidate 
differences between pain control strategies where the impact of confounding variables would be 
minimized.  
In summary we believe this study will help develop an important strategy aimed at post -operative pain 
control. Additionally, this study will help the continued development of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_153735].

• D esign & Procedures:  
Preoperat ively, patients will be given standard of care premedication: 975mg acetaminophen, 600mg 
gabapentin, and [ADDRESS_177382] ors such as allergy/intolerance.  
Prior to surgery the patients will be randomized to receive either surgical infiltration or QL block. This 
randomization will be done utilizing an online research randomizer (https://www.randomizer.org/).  
  
 Intraoperatively, patients will be given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation which is the 
standard of care for these types of procedures. Induction will be achieved with propofol, lidocaine, 
fentanyl and a non -depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.   Maintenance will be achieved with 
sevoflurane.  A total of [ADDRESS_177383].   A one -
time IV bolus of 10mg IV dexamethasone (will not be given in diabetic patients) will be administered at 
the beginning of the procedure.    After the completion of the surgery the patient will either receive [ADDRESS_177384]- operative care unit (PACU).  
  
Post operatively patients will receive Tylenol 650 mg PO Q6h, Gabapentin 100 mg PO Q8h, and Toradol 
15 mg IV Q8h (for a total of 3 doses). Additionally, patients will have post -operative orders for 
supplementary pain control that include 25mcg IV fentanyl for breakthrough pain, Tramadol 25 mg PO 
Q6h for pain score of 4 -6/10, and Tramadol 50 mg PO Q6h for pain scores 7 -10/10.  
  
Upon arriving to the PACU  patients will be assessed to determine their level of pain as well as 
nausea/vomiting. Subjects’ verbal pain scores (NRS 11), opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], and GI complications will 
be recorded hourly for the first four hours, at [ADDRESS_177385] -surgical 
intervention. 24h opi[INVESTIGATOR_113842] (IV morphine equivalents) will be calculated.  On post  op day [ADDRESS_177386] op day 7 and will be asked the same questions they were asked during 
their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153736], nausea/vomiting events, and GI complications.

• Subject Recruitment and Compensation: 
Only patients who are having living donor nephrectomies are eligible for this study. We will not bias any 
demographic groups in identifying patients eligible for this study. A total of up to 50  patients will be 
consented from Duke University Medical Center. Patients will not receive any additional compensation for enrollment in this study.  
 
Recruitment will be facilitated by [CONTACT_153748] “My Chart.” A recruitment letter will be sent to potential  
subjects on behalf of their anesthesia provider informing them of the study with the research team’s  
contact [CONTACT_153749] -out option. Research team members 
will follow up 1 week after MyChart letters/communication hav e been sent if there has been no 
response from  potential candidates. Written consent will be collected at in -person visit before surgery.  
 
• Consent Process:

about the study with an option to opt -out or express interest. The patient will 
then be contact[CONTACT_153750], and will have an opportunity to ask questions a t that time. The patient will then 
have additional time to consider participation prior to arriving  for the session  
 In cases where it is not possible to obtain consent the evening prior we would 
obtain consent the day of surgery. Given that the interventio n we are proposing 
is already happening as part of the routine care, we believe that there is no significant additional risk to the patient and would not be unreasonable to ask 
for consent the day of surgery if we were unable to obtain it the evening befor e.

participant?  
 Throughout the consent process, measures will be taken to maintain privacy, 
such as conducting face -to-face conversations in private rooms.  
o How much time will be allocated for conducting the initial consent discussion, including 
presenting the inf ormation in the consent document and answering questions, with 
each prospective participant?  
 As much time as necessary will be spent with each potential participant to sufficiently explain and answer all questions, and address all concerns they may have in  regard to the study and/or consent process.  
o What arrangements will be in place for answering participant questions before and after 
the consent is signed?  
 Each potential participant will have ample time to ask questions both before 
and after the consent i s signed. The participant will be given a copy of the 
signed consent with contact [CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_153738].

• Cost to the Subject:  
 Subjects will not incur any additional costs to participate in the study.   
• D ata Analysis and Statistical Considerations:  
The primary hypothesis, that there is a difference in 24h opi[INVESTIGATOR_153741].   We will also look at secondary outcomes evaluating numeric pain scores, GI complications 
(such as constipation and bloating and Nausea/Vomiting) and recovery between the two groups. 
Parametric and non -parametric data will be analyzed using t -tests, Chi -Squared, and Mann -Whitney 
tests as appropriate If there i s evidence of a difference in numeric pain score during the periods studied, 
we will perform post -hoc pair -wise multiple comparison corrected tests to identify the time -points 
where the intervention groups differ on pain score.   Additional secondary analys es will assess 
differences in cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_153742], numerical pain scores, and 
functional assays with parametric or non- parametric tests as appropriate. Statisticians employed by [CONTACT_153753].  
            A total of up to [ADDRESS_177389] with 
a=0.05, b=0.8, difference in means=2, and effect size of 1.0. The sample size required for a non -
parametric test will provide greater than 80% power if the data meet requirements for a parametric t -
test (https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2.html).

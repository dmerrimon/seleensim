Objectives  Primary:  
To determine whether a visible respi[INVESTIGATOR_527037] a predefined exhaled target tidal 
volume range of 4 – 8 mls/ kg.  
Secondary:  
To determine  whether visible  data and waveforms displayed on an RFM impact other 
clinical , phys iological, and biochemical indicators of ineffective lung aeration.  
Number of Subjects  286 infants across 6 sites  
Main Inclusion and 
Exclusion Criteria  Infants will be included in this study if they are (1) between 24 and 27  6/7 weeks 
gestation (2) receiving PPV for resuscitation at birth .  Exclusion criteria include (1)  a 
congenital  abnormality which might interfere with breathing , (2) RFM not available . 
Intervention  In the RFM -visible group, the RFM will record respi[INVESTIGATOR_527038], and the RFM display will be visible to the clinical resuscitation team  in 
addition to routine clinical monitoring .   
Reference Group  In the RFM -masked group, the RFM will record respi[INVESTIGATOR_527038], but the RFM display will not be visible to the clinical resuscitation team.  
Routine clinical monitoring alone will be used during PPV.  
Statistical Methodology  The Primary outcome will be analyzed as a comparison of proportion of exhaled tidal 
volumes 4 -8 mls/kg between the RFM -visible and RFM -masked  groups.  
Secondary outcome measures of ineffective lung aeration will be analyzed through 
mean and proportion comparisons between the RFM -visible  and RFM -masked 
groups.  
Safety Evaluations  DSMB d ata monitoring of the trial will occur over the first month and every [ADDRESS_683895] 10% in mortality in the first 
week  of life , the trial will be stopped.  
Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan  An external  DSMB is comprised of three members : a trained neonatologist, a 
biostatist ician, and pediatric oncologist , all with extensive experience in conducting 
trials. The DSMB will be updated in the progress of the trial every [ADDRESS_683896] extremely premature ne wborns require 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_527039] (PPV) during this transition.  However, 
non-invasive (facemask) PPV is technically challenging to perform. Inadequate (too little) PPV 
inflation leads to ineffective ventilation and hypo xia, manifested by a lack of prompt rise in 
heart rate and progression to need for tracheal intubation.  Excessive (too large) PPV inflations 
damage the newborn lung from stretch and pressure injury.  Providers have few tools to 
identify inadequate or exce ssive PPV inflations.  Current delivery room technology is inadequate 
to guide PPV inflations delivered to preterm infants.  
 
This is a randomized trial to determine if a visible respi[INVESTIGATOR_527040] (RFM) display ing 
real-time  measurements of delive red inflations improves clinical providers’ ability to perform 
PPV within a pre -defined target tidal volume  in preterm infants after birth . 
1.2 Background and Relevant Literature  
 
Extremely preterm infants often fail to establish efficient gas exchange independently in the 
delivery room (DR) 1,[ADDRESS_683897] are 
required.  
 
Caregivers are guided by i nternational and national neonatal resuscitation guidelines and a face 
mask is commonly recommended and widely used for initial ventilation after birth.15,16 A tight 
seal between mask and face creating a leak free ventilation circuit  is important to provid e 
positive end expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to  the 
transitioning preterm infant.[ADDRESS_683898] obstruction occur.19,23 ,24 
With variable leaks, variable tidal volumes are delivered that may be either inadequate or 
excessive cau sing lung injury. This has been described as atelectotrauma, rheotrauma and 
barotrauma. Moreover, inadequate ventilation may lead to persistently lower oxygen 
saturations (SpO2) prompting clinicians to increase FiO2. The newly born infant’s lung is

 [ADDRESS_683899] this.  
 
Traditionally, adequacy of ventilation during positive pressure ventilation (PPV) in the DR is 
assessed by [CONTACT_527080].[ADDRESS_683900] pressure, gas flow, tidal volume (VT) and gas leak at the endotracheal tube (ETT).20-22  
 
1.3 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_527041] (RFM)  
 
Recently, it has been demonstrated that the use of a respi[INVESTIGATOR_527040] (RFM) can 
guide PPV in the DR.23,27   In this study, the New Life Box, (Advanced Life Diagnostics, Weener, 
[LOCATION_013]) a neonatal Respi[INVESTIGATOR_140658] (RFM), will be used to measu re and  calculate 
inflation pressures, flow , and tidal volumes in all enrolled infants.  The New Life B ox uses a 
small (dead space 0.7 mL) variable orifice anemometer to measure gas flow in and out of a 
face -mask or endotracheal tube. This signal is automatically integrated to provide inspi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] (Vti) 
and expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] (Vte) tidal volume. The difference equals the leak from the facemask or 
endotracheal tube. Complete airway obstruction occurs when no flow of gas into or away from 
the infant is seen during a positive pressure inflation. The RFM can also calculate  and measure  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_527042], i nflat ions and spontaneous inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1520] , and all ventilation 
pressures. U sing customized software heart rate, oxygen saturation and expi[INVESTIGATOR_527043].  
 
The NewLife Box  monitor presents graphical information for pressure, flow,  and volume.  In 
addition, the monitor displays numeric data for pressure (P IP and P EEP), tidal volume (Vti, Vte), 
flow, respi[INVESTIGATOR_527044].  The monitor integrates and  displays physiologic data 
streaming from the patient (heart rate and oxy gen saturation) as well as FiO2 from an oxygen 
analyzer in the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_527045].  If enabled, t he monitor can 
incorporate video captured from an external camera.  The video  serves as a helpful  aid in the 
interpretation of the events during the RFM waveform recordings.  
 
1.4 Preliminary  Clinical Studies  of RFM  
 
Kattwinkel  et al, showed using a mechanical model of an infant’s lung during a simulation of 
neonatal resuscitation, operators had a faster response to compliance changes if tidal volumes 
were displayed.[ADDRESS_683901] has the potential to improve neonatal respi[INVESTIGATOR_527046]. To prove this, a large randomized trial is needed.  
2. Study Objectives  
 
Our hypotheses are that using a RFM during PPV resuscitation of infants at birth will lead to: 1) 
a lower incidence of large mask leaks, 2) less frequent airway obstruction, 3) more rapid and 
frequent evaluation and adjustment of mask hold and position, 4) faster recognition of 
spontaneous breathing, 5 ) faster recognition of potentially injurious tidal volumes, and 6) more 
prompt and appropriate adjustment of applied airway pressures. All these effects we speculate 
will contribute to a more adequate and less injurious delivery of PPV (proportion of tida l 
volumes within the target range of safe tidal ventilation) and therefore potentially better 
resuscitation and outcome for the infants.  
2.[ADDRESS_683902] the hypothesis that observing the data and waveforms displayed on an RFM during the 
provisio n of PPV to preterm infants (24 -27 6/7 weeks gestation) after birth will increase the 
proportion  of inflations performed with a predefined  VTe “safe range” of 4 – 8 mls/kg.  
2.[ADDRESS_683903] other 
longitudinal clinical , physiological, and biochemical indicators of ineffective lung aeration.   
3. Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
 
This is a multi -center, non -blinded, randomized controlled trial to evaluate  whether a visible 
RFM display increases the proportion of inf lations performed with  VTe within target  range of 4 -
8 mls/kg in infants born between 24 and 27 6/[ADDRESS_683904] the parameters of all inflations delivered during 
resuscitation of all enrolled infants.  In the RFM -visible group, the information on the RFM 
display will be visible to clinical providers, while in the RFM -masked group, the RFM display will 
be masked.  
3.2 Screening Phase  
 
The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_527047] ( HUP ) to preliminarily assess 
eligibility based on estimated gestational age and maternal labor status.   Women with 
threatened delivery  between 24 -276/7 weeks gestation will be screened for eligibility. Following 
the prenatal consult performed by [CONTACT_527081], a member of the study team 
will approach the mother to offer study participation for the infant and obtain antenatal 
informed cons ent (See Ethics, below).  This conversation will be coordinated with other ongoing 
studies of preterm infants (See, Concurrent Enrollment).  
3.3 Study Intervention Phase  
 
At time of resuscitation, following birth and randomization, a neonatal Respi[INVESTIGATOR_140658] 
(RFM) will be used to measure, calculate and display inflation pressures, flow and tidal volumes. 
It is standard practice in the HUP NICU to record resuscitations w ith the RFM masked as part of 
an ongoing departmental Quality Improvement project.  
In infants randomized to the intervention, the clinical team will be able to directly observe the 
monitor . Those randomized to the RFM -masked  display arm will only see a bla ck screen, though 
the RFM will be collecting data in the background.  
 
Oxygenation and heart rate will be measured with the Philips Intelliview vitals monitor via a 
pulse oximeter and electrocardiogram monitoring.  A pulse oximetry probe will be placed on 
each infant’s right upper extremity. The concentration of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) will be 
measured with a Teledyne oxygen analyzer inserted into the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_527048]. In centers where it is allowed, a digital video recording of each r esuscitation will be 
made . The video recor ding will only show the infant and the hands of staff. It will not show the 
mother, father, obstetric al staff , or obstetric procedures.  
 
All signals measured will be digitized and recorded at 200Hz using the Bicor e physiological 
recording program (a customized neonatal respi[INVESTIGATOR_527049]) or Spectra 
physiological recording program (a customized neonatal respi[INVESTIGATOR_527049]).  
3.3.1  Allocation to Interventional Group  
 
Eligible  infants born between 24 and 276/[ADDRESS_683905] 
the RFM visible or covered.  Randomization will occur directly before delivery, so the RFM 
display can be visible or masked, according to group allocation.  Allocation will be stratified by 
 
[CONTACT_527082].   
 6 center and gestational age (24 -25 and 26 -27 weeks) using variable block (4 -8) sizes. Generation 
of the randomization envelopes will be done centrally for the trial . Concealment of the 
allocation will be ensured by [CONTACT_527083].  
 
In case o f multiple births: if two monitors are available each infant will be randomized 
separately. If only [ADDRESS_683906] and the 
following one, both/all infants will be randomized.  
 
Envelopes for each gestational age strata will be stored and available in the infant resuscitation 
room. The envelope will be opened before birth of the infant by [CONTACT_527084] , or a member of the study team . 
3.4 Primary Endpoint

There is no follow up involvement after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
4.5 Total Number of Subjects and Sites  
 
There are 6 clinical sites .  Recruitment will end when approximately 286  evaluable  infants are 
recruited.  At UPenn, we anticip ate enrolling 80 infants over 3 years  in order to produce 50 
evaluable subjects.  
 
The 6 sites include:  
1. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326511], Philadelphia, [LOCATION_002]  
2. Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands  
3. Department of Newborn Research, Royal Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Melbourne, Australia  
4. Maternal & Children’s University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527025], Valencia, Spain  
5. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, V.Buzzi Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Milan, Italy  
6. Karolinska University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527026], Stockholm, Sweden  
 
Infant’s transferred from HUP to Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP) for continued 
medical care before [ADDRESS_683911] their medical records 
reviewed for long term outcome data.  
4.6 Vulnerable Populations:  
 
This study will enroll neonates , in accordance with HHS regulations 45CFR 46.  
5. Study Intervention  
5.[ADDRESS_683912] Encounter: Delivery Room  
 
There is o nly one subject encounter in this study design: the respi[INVESTIGATOR_527052].  Data collected to ascertain the secondary 
outcomes will be obtained from review of the medical record.  
 
The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_527053].  The respi[INVESTIGATOR_527054].   
 9 use.  The RFM (NewLife Box, Advanced Life Diagnostics) will be calibrated and set up  prior to 
delivery.  A disposable neonatal flow transducer (Avea neonatal flow sensor, Carefusion, Yorba 
Linda CA)  will be placed in line between the facemask and respi[INVESTIGATOR_527055]. Resuscitation 
team members will follow a standard protocol to set up the RFM and initiate recording, which 
does not require technical expertise.   Data files will be labeled with a unique study -specific 
identifier that does not contain protected information.  The monitor itself is user -friendly, and 
requires only pressing a but ton to initiate recording.  
 
The RFM has a button that will cause the screen to be black, although the monitor is still 
recording respi[INVESTIGATOR_527056]. Once the randomization envelope is opened, the screen 
will be either left visible or “blacked out” a ccording to the assigned group allocation.  
5.[ADDRESS_683913] in each participating center, led by [CONTACT_527087].  
At HUP, all neonatal providers who perform the “leader” role during infant resuscitation will 
receive standardized training in RFM waveform and output interpretation.  
5.4 Blinding  
 
It is impossible to blind the caregivers to the intervention as the disp lay will be clearly either 
visible or masked. However, we plan to centralize waveform, data and video analysis from the 
monitor whereby [CONTACT_39359] (PhD student in Leiden) is blinded to the allocation.  
5.5 Technique of Resuscitation  
 
Other than allocation o f the visible or masked RFM, all other resuscitative measures (e.g. 
intubation, external cardiac massage, administration of oxygen and other drugs) will be at the 
discretion of the staff involved, following local standard of care protocols.  
 
The primary eq uipment used to provide resuscitation will be a T -pi[INVESTIGATOR_527057].  
 
When performing a delivery room trial in multiple centers, different local resuscitation 
guidelines are inevitable. However, this can be considered as strength of the trial as this could 
show that using a monitor is useful independent of practiced resuscitation guidelines.

 The infant is stabilized on non -invasive supp ort and is transitioned to nasal prong CPAP  
 Disconnection of the endotracheal tube for administration of surfactant delivery or 
connection to the ventilator  
 [ADDRESS_683915] elapsed  
 At the discretion of the resuscitation team leader  
 
After the sensors are removed from the circuit, the New Life Box will recording will be 
discontinued.  The program will automatically save the data file under the study -specific 
identifier that was entered during the set -up process.  
6. Study Procedures  
All e ncounters will take place during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Screening will occur on an antenatal 
basis,  and the study encounter will take place during delivery room resuscitation after birth.  All 
subsequent data will be collected from the patient medical record.  
6.[ADDRESS_683916] on an antenatal basis.  Women admitted to the Labor and Delivery 
floor with threatened preterm delivery between 24 -27 6/7 weeks  will be screened  for eligibility .  
Parents  of potentially eligible infants will be approached to offer  study participation and obtain 
informed consent.  
6.2 Study Intervention Phase  
 
As noted in Section 5.2, the only study -related intervention is use of the R FM (either blinded or 
visible) during delivery room resuscitation.  
6.[ADDRESS_683917] Withdrawal  
 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may 
also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator due to changes in 
clinical status that make them ineligible for the study (ie, congenital anomaly diagn osed, or PPV

completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on 
the CRF.  
 
Statistics on the number of subjects who are withdrawn and the reason for withdrawal will be 
maintained to account for all e nrolled subjects.  
6.5 Safety Evaluations  
 
In accordance with University of Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures, Federal and 
State Laws and Regulations, and section 10, subsection 1, of the Dutch WMO, the investigator 
will inform the subjects’ parents  or caregivers and the reviewing accredited IRB if anything 
occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages of participation may be 
significantly greater than was foreseen in the research proposal. The study will be suspended 
pending furthe r review by [CONTACT_527088], except insofar as suspension would jeopardi ze 
the subjects’ health. The investigator will ensure that all subjects’ parents or caregivers are kept 
informed.  
7. Statistical Plan  
7.[ADDRESS_683919] descriptive statistics 
(including mean and standard deviation for continuous variables, such as birth weight and 
standard percentages for dichotomous variables such as sex)  
7.2 Primary and Secondary Outcomes  
 
The Primary outcome will be analyzed as a comparison of proportion of tidal volumes within 
the predefined safe range (4 -8 mls/kg) between the RFM exposed and RFM masked groups 
using Chi square test.   
 
Secondary outcome measures of ineffective lung aeration wil l be analyzed through mean and 
proportion comparisons between the RFM exposed and RFM masked groups.  
7.3 Sample Size and Power Determination  
 
There are few data available to estimate possible improvements when a RFM is used. Only one 
small feasibility study (f rom Melbourne, one of the participating centers) is available where 
median mask leak decreased from 54 (37 -82) % to 37 (21 -54) % when a monitor was used, PIP 
was adjusted more often (42 % vs 9%), mask was repositioned more often (73 vs 26%) and less 
infant s had Vte > 8 mL/kg (20% reduction). It is likely that less mask leak and pressure 
adjustment led to more efficient respi[INVESTIGATOR_527058] < 32

 12 weeks of gestation needed intubation in the delivery room in the group where the  RFM was 
visible (21 % vs 57 %; p  = 0.035).31 In addition, Wood et al, showed, in a manikin study, that 
mask leak was halved when a RFM was used during mask ventilation. 23  
 
The primary outcome will be the proportion of tidal volumes within the target range (4 - 8 
ml/kg).  This will be calculated as the proportion of adequate tidal volume of the total amount 
of inflations per infant. The duration of PPV provided will vary betw een infants and this may be 
a source of bias. To minimize this, we will take the proportion of adequate tidal volume as a 
percentage of the total amount of inflations per infant.  
 
About 60 infants <[ADDRESS_683920] all 
infants receive PPV at birth. Currently the median (IQR) proportion of adequate tidal volumes 
given to infants during PPV at birth is 25% (5% -45%) (based on recordings in Leiden). Therefore, 
we calculated to detect an 40% absolute increase  in proportion of adequate tidal volumes 
(corresponding to an increase from 25% to 35%) with a power of 80% and an α error of 5% (two 
tailed test), 143 infants are required for each arm.  
 
With 6 centers participating and on average 50 infants < 28 weeks g estation per year per center 
and taking into account (based on previous delivery room trials using waiver of consent) an 
estimated 20% of denials for consent, missed eligible patients, problems with equipment, we 
will be able to recruit [ADDRESS_683921] a higher 
threshold for intubati on. In addition, it will be difficult to reach consensus between the 
participating centers as different intubation criteria are currently used.  
8. Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or expe rience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  All adverse events observed by [CONTACT_527089].  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that 
is:

 13  fatal  
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -
serious adverse events.  
8.[ADDRESS_683922], or if reported by [CONTACT_527090].    
Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and 
also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  
 
All adverse events occurring in the infant resuscitation room will be recorded. The clinical 
course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabil ization, or until it has been 
determined that the study participation is not the cause

safety.  Specifically, all adverse events (serious or non -serious) that occur in the delivery room 
setting will be assessed and recorded.  The local study investigator will determine the 
relationship between s tudy procedure and adverse events that occur in the delivery room 
(definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unlikely or unrelated).

there are significant imbalances between study groups with regards to these outcomes.  
 
8.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
 
Investigators will submit reports of the following problems within 24 hours from the time the 
investigator becomes aware of the event: Any serious adverse event that occurs any time 
during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_58812]: 
Unexpecte d (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent do cument 
and other relevant sources of information) AND Related to the research procedures (An event is 
“related to the research procedures” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], 
the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_527092].)  
 
Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to 
the Penn IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others 
Including Reportable Adverse Events”  or as a written report of the event (including a 
description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -
up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other study documentation).  
 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_527061] t and documentation of IRB notification and receipt will be kept in the 
Clinical Investigator’s study file as well as forwarded to the Coordinating site in Leiden.  
 
8.4.1 Follow -up report  
 
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new inf ormation arises that 
changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant 
new or reassessed information will be submitted to the IRB.  
8.4.2 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Penn IRB

Interim analysis September -October 2017  
 
A pre-planned  interim analysis of the Monitor trial was performed after 50% of inclusions with 
primary  outcome data were  available. The investigator and the statistician involved in the trial 
collected and performed the analysis blinded for the groups. The results were submitted to the 
DSMB on the 25th of Octob er 2017. The results showed no safety concerns, but also no 
difference in primary outcome (proportion of tidal volume delivered between 4 -8 mL/kg) with a 
p value of 0.96. Since this met the criterion of the pre -defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_527064] (p -value > 
0.90), the DSMB recommended to stop the trial on  November 14, 2017 .  
 
The recommendation was immediately communicated with all principal investigators of the 
sites participating in the trial and the recruitment was temporarily halted. A  Steering 
Committee conference call was held to d iscuss the recommendation  on November 28, 2017. All 
investigators agreed  to continue the t rial and reach full recruitment, based on the following:  
 At the time the recommendation of the DSMB became available , the recruitment rate 
was already at 75%. Collecting the data for the primary outcome was a time -consuming 
process as the analysis of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_527065].  
 The presence of a learning curve in using the monitor was propo sed and continuing 
recruitment will increase the chance of observing chances in performance as centers 
gain experience.  
 There is no evidence of safety concerns  
  
Given this, all members of the Steering Committee agreed  continue  enrollment to reach the 
original goal enrollment, anticipated by [CONTACT_5638] 2018.  
 
This decision was endorsed by [CONTACT_4318].

the potential risks, benefits, and requirements of participation s o that each can make an 
informed decision about participation  
 the right to decline, which requires that prospective participants be fully informed that 
their participation is completely voluntary, that they may withdraw at any time, that 
access to adequate  health care will be provided whether or not they participate in the 
research, and that they may refuse to answer any question  
 the right to privacy, which requires guarantees of confidentiality of information and 
other specific protection as specified in the Privacy Act of 1974.  
The basic rights of study participants will be respected and maintained by [CONTACT_527094]. Our data 
collection and processing procedures  are designed to protect individual rights and to comply 
with all applicable laws and ethical principles.  
 
The data collection forms will include unique study ID numbers only and basic demographic 
data as participant identifiers. Thus, the files maintained will contain limited identifying 
information and protect subject confidentiality. Safeguards are in place to greatly decrease the 
chances that characteristics of  a case  can be linked to the individual participating in the study.   
Access to direc t identifiers will be limited to staff who meet all relevant training requirements 
and are assigned to (or support) this project, and who must have access to these identifiers for 
purposes of quality control and monitoring. All other persons, including sta tisticians and 
investigators will be blinded to identifiers until such time as for reasons of safety or clinical 
care, those identifiers must be shared. All data with identifiers will be stored on firewall -
protected secure servers.  
9.2 Data  and Device  Collecti on, Storage,  and Management  
9.2.1 Storage of the RFM  
The RFM is locked and secured in the restricted -access infant resuscitation room (IR). The RFM 
is clearly labeled for ‘RESEARCH USE ONLY’ and contact [CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_527066]. The RFM  is routinely checked by [CONTACT_527095], Netherlands.

9.2.4  Case Report Forms  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection in strument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on 
the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write 
“N/D”.  If the item is not applicable  to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be

collaborative data.  
 
When infants are eligible, but not randomized or excluded afterwards, only the screening CRF 
concerning eligibility and randomization will be completed.     
 
Individual patient RFM data will be stored on a secure server on a password protected

The Avea neonatal f low sensors (Carefusion) added in line are FDA -approved for clinical use.  
The potential risks include minimal added dead space to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_527069] (approximately 0.7mL of dead space).  This is not considered to be a signif icant addition 
to potential dead space in the circuit, after considering the existing respi[INVESTIGATOR_527070]. Previous published studies of RFM have not reported adverse events due to the 
sensors’ presence.  
 
All other physiologic monitoring will b e obtained using the current standard -of-care sensors (ie, 
heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse oximetry).  Data from all of these sensors will be 
collected and recorded by [CONTACT_527097][INVESTIGATOR_527041].  The New Life Box is

display at any point during the resuscitation if s/he is concerned about the impact of the RFM 
on the resuscitation (See Section 5.6, Discontinuation of Monitoring).  
 
Investigational devices that carry si gnificant risk must have an investigational device exemption 
(IDE) filed prior to initiation of clinical studies. Research involving non -significant risk devices is 
subject to approval by [CONTACT_527098]. Because the NewLifeBox is a non -significant risk device, we will not seek an IDE, based 
on The Federal Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations: CFR Title 21, Section 812.3.

higher proportion of PPV inflations delivered within a pre -specified “safe” VTe range . The 
indirect benefit of study participation is the contributing to the scientific knowledge for future 
prete rm infants.  The study outlined in this proposal will generate important knowledge about 
the respi[INVESTIGATOR_527071].  
Given that the risks of the study are minimal and the potential benefits t o future infants, it is 
reasonable to proceed with the project.

Prior to delivery, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_527072]. The consent process will take 
place in a private room. Following the consent discussion, a copy of the consent for m will be 
provided to the parents, and they  will have the opportunity to r eview the form before providing  
consent.  
10.3.1  Co-Enrollment  
 
There is potential for co -enrollment with other delivery room studies that require antenatal 
consent.  The Monitor study team will communicate with other neonatal study teams to ensure 
that consent discussions are coordinated among all investigators, in orde r to reduce the 
parental burden.

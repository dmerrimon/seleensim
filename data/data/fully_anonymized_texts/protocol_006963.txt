5. OUTCOME S
Objective 1 of the RE -COVERY study  is designed to characterize the deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT )/pulmonary  embolism ( PE)patient population including the initial acute event phase. 
All patients with a DVT and/or PE will be enrolled for cross -sectional characterization of the 
venous thromboembolism ( VTE) patient population and descriptions of current treatment 
patterns, and stratified b y geographical location.
The following research questions will be investigated:
With the approval of dabigatran etexilate and other non- vitamin K anticoagulants
(NOACs ), what treatments are being administered for acute VTE in routine clinical 
practice in the different re gions of the world?
When presenting with an acute VTE event, what factors influence the choice of 
treatment for the event?
5.1 M AIN OUTCOMES
The following primary  outcome measures will be anal yzed on data that 
arecollected at th e 
time of the acute VTE event:
Demographic information (age and gender)
VTE event information (event ty pe and treatment for event)

6. GENERAL ANALYSIS DEFI NITIONS
6.1 EXPOSURE
ForObjective 1 ,VTE treatment information will be collected at two time points, baseline and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]/14 days after baseline , due to the requirement of heparin pre -treatment for 
some of the studied oral anticoagulants.
On the eCRF page, five oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonist, dabigatran, edoxaban, 
rivaroxaban, and api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) are included as pre-specified options, togethe r with three typesof
heparin pre -treatment (low molecular weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, and
fondaparinux) 
andtwo t ypes of non-oral therapie s (systemic thrombol ytic therap yand
catheter directed thromboly tic therapy ). Patients will be assigned to one of the five oral 
anticoagulant groups oran additional “Other” group (defined as patients with nooral 
anticoagulant prescribed ), based on the following rules
.

eCRF page by [CONTACT_80664].
In the event that p atients with other combinations of treatment information at baseline and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]/14 days, such as those listed below, areidentified , their treatment 
assignment should be discussed and determined on a case -by-case basis by [CONTACT_80665] (MQRM s
). In the event that a decision

resolved b y the sites .

IMPORTANT PROTOCOL VI OLATIONS
Patients with important protocol violations (IPVs) will be documented. Thelist of all protocol 
violations (or deviations) and their handling rules aredocumented in detail in the separate 
document Protoco l Deviation Specification .
Additional I PVs may  be defined during the course of the study , based on assessments at the 
MQR Ms; if the list of I PVs needs to be enlarged, it will be documented in the report planning 
meeting minutes before database lock.
6.3 P ATIENT SETS ANALY SED
The planned anal ysis for Objective 1 will be based on all eligible patients (i.e. all patients 
who fulfil all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria ).

6.5 P OOLING OF CENTERS
Centre will not be used as a variable in any  anal ysis; therefore this section is not relevant .  
6.6 H ANDLING OF MISSING DATA AND OUTLIERS
For Objective 1, the presence of missing data is expected to be low, since the variables are 
expected to be collected in routine clinical practice and should therefore be available in the 
patient’s medical record. As a result, an y missing data will be treated as missing and no 
imputation will be performed .
The amount of missing data will be reported in the descriptive 
summary  tables ( i.e. a 
'Missing' category  will be display ed for variables with missing data ).
Depending on the amount of missing data (e.g., >10% for a key variable), sensitivity analysis 
may be performed, where the distribution of other variables (age, sex, and other patient
characteristics) will be compared between patients with and without missing data for each 
variable , and reported.

6.7 B ASELINE, TIME WINDOWS AND CALCULATED VIS ITS
The planned analysis for Objective 1 is cross-sectional in nature. However, in addition to the data 
collected at the baseline visit, additional data at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 14 days after the baseline 
visit (whichever later) will be collected and included in the analysis. This is because thetreatment 
with some NOACs (e.g. dabigatran and edoxaban) requires 5 to 10 days of pre -treatment with 
parenteral therapy .

7. PLANNED ANALYSIS
Summary  statistics for continuous variables will include the number of observations (N), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), minimum, Q1 (25thpercentile), median, Q3 (75thpercentile), and 
maximum; tabulations of categorical variables will present all possible categories and will display 
the number of observations per category as well as percentages. The default precision for 
percentages should be one decimal place, unless otherwise specified. In general, percentages will 
be based on all patients in the analysis population, whether they have missing data or not. A 
category  'Missing' will be display ed whenever at least one patient falls within this category. For 
variables based on nested questions (i.e. questions which ask for more detailed information only 
within the subgroup of patients with a specific value for another higher lever question), 
percentages will be based on the patients with the corresponding value for the higher level 
question .
Individual patient listings will be created, which generally will be sorted by [CONTACT_80666], region, cou ntry, center number and subject number, and be based on the 
analy sis population used for the corresponding table.

7.9 S AFETY ANALYSIS
7.9.1 Adverse drug reactions
For Objective 1, p atients will not be followed up after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 14 day safter 
baseline . If the i nvestigator becomes aware of an event at the baseline visit or when entering 
the data collected at the baseli ne visit that is deemed by  [CONTACT_941] i
nvestigator to be related to a 
Boehringer Ingelheim drug, the investigator is responsible for entering this information in the
Adverse Drug Reactions/Adverse Events with Fatal Outcome page of the eCRFs. However, 
these data will not be analy zed for Objective 1. A listing of all reported ADRs/fatal AEs will 
be provided in the stud y report appendix .

Objective 1 of the RE-COVER was described in a separate Document, “Statistical and 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_80650] -Objective 1”. 
The following two questions were investigated in the SEAP for Objective 1:
With the approval of dabigatran etexilate and other non-vitamin K anticoagulants 
(NOACs), what treatments are being administered for acute VTE in routine clinical 
practice in the different regions of the world?
When presenting with an acute VTE event, what factors influence the choice of 
treatment for the event?
Obje ctive 2 of the RE-COVER study is designed to analy
ze the safety and effectiveness of 
dabigatran etexilate regimens in the treatment of DVT and PE over 1year of follow -up in 
comparison to a VKA regimen.
Additional further exploratory  objectives are:
To evaluate geographical varia tions 
in health care resource utilization and patient 
satisfacti on with their treatment in routine clinical practice.
To conduct stratified analy sis for the safet y and effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate 
according to dose.
The following three questions will be investigated: 
What is the safety  and effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate versus VKA under 
conditions of routine clinical practice?
What health care resources are utilized in patients who aretreated with dabigatran
etexilate or VKA for an acute VTE under conditions of routine clinical practice?
For patients who are treated with either dabigatran etexilate or VKA, what is patients’
satisfaction with their treatment under conditions of routine clinical practice?
5.1 M AIN OUTCOMES
The main outcomes for Objective 2 are :
Primary  safety outcome measure: ISTH Major bleeding and ISTH clinically  relevant 
non major bleeding (CRNMB)
Primary  effectiveness 
outcome measure: symptomatic recurrent VTE including VTE-
related mortali ty 
A patient is considered to have major bleeding if the bleeding is fatal and/or meets at least one 
of the following criteria :
Overt bleeding associated with a reduction in hemoglobin of at least [ADDRESS_87975] 2 units of blood or packed cells

6.1 E XPOSURE
Patients will be analy zed in treatment groups (DE or VKA) according to the treatment that has 
been prescribed at the baseline visit and at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 14 days after the baseline visit 
and recorded in the Patient Status eCRF (obtained at enrolment). The start of the follow up will be 
defined as the initiation of each of these two treatments.
6.2 IMPORTANT PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS
Patients with important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be documented. The list of all protocol 
deviations (PDs)and their handling rules are documented in detail in the separate document 
Protocol Deviation Specification. Additional IPDs may be defined during the course of the 
study , based on assessments at the MQRMs; if the list of IPDs needs to be enlarged, it will be 
documented in the report planning meeting minutes before database lock.
6.3 PATIENT SETS ANALYSE D
Three patient sets are defined: "all eligible" , “all eligible treated”, and “restricted”; the 
following rules are used to assess if a patient is included in an anal ysis set:
ALL E LIGIBLE: If a patient fulf illsall inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria .
ALL ELIGIBLE TREATED: If a patient fulfills all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria 
and took prescribed treatment at least once.
RESTRI CTED: The restricted population is composed of all eligible patients within the 
trimmed patient set which lie within the region of propensit y score overlap (for definition see
Section 7). As the propensity  score analysis will be based on eligible patients who at least 
once took the prescribed treatment, the restricted population excludes patients prescribed the 
treatment but who did not take it. 
Number of patients included in the different patient sets will be shown by  [CONTACT_1570].

6.6 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA AND OUTL IERS
Every  reasonable attempt will be undertaken to ensure completeness of data collection.
A review of the data will be performed at the MQRM in order to review reasons and patterns 
of missing values in the data and to decide on the need for countermeasur es.

Reference Document "Template Trial Statistical Analysis Plan -template " 001-MCG -160_RD -06(7.0) /Saved on:08Jun2015In general, “unknown” data will be treated as missing. This is because when in the CRF the 
option “unknown” is given for a question, it is obligatory  to tick one optional answer (no 
missing values). If no “unknown” option is present in the respective question, it is not 
obligatory  to tick one optional answer (leading to missing values if not answered at all).
In the descriptive anal yses, unknown values will be treated as an additional category .
Multiple imputations (MI) technique will be used for handl ing missing value for any of the 
covariates included in the logistic regression (i.e., alcohol abuse , BMI, Creatinine clearance
and smoking status) for the derivation of the average estimated propensity  score (ePS). The 
mean of the ePS for each patient will be estimated from each of the m imputed data sets based 
generall y on Rubin’s approach for combining multiple imputed estimates. For example, if [ADDRESS_87977] 5 ePS from which a mean ePS would be 
directly  estimated for each patient.
6.7 BASELINE, TIME WINDO WS AND CALCULATED VI SITS
Thebaseline analysis for Objective 2 is cross -sectional in nature. Patients will be assigned to 
the two treatment groups as described in Section 6.1. For the descriptive analy sis, in addition 
to the data collected at the baseline visit, additional data at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 14 days after 
the baseline visit (whichever is later) will be collected and summarized descriptively .  For the 
logistic regression analysis to produce estimated propensit y scores, data up to the start of 
dabigatran or VKA treatment will be considered asbaseline and will be used as model 
covariates.
Data from the longitudinal follow -up for collected laboratory  data, healthcare resource 
utilization ,and PACT -Q2 will besummarized descriptively  at the time points given in Table 
5.3: 2.In case time windows will be needed in order to assign observations to visits ,
observations from 45daysto 134days after diagnosis will be assigned to month 3, from [ADDRESS_87978] will be assigned. Month 3 corresponds to 91 day s, month 6 to 182 
days, and year 1 to 365 day s.

The propensity  scoreswill be estimated after the multiple imputation is performed based on 
eligible patients who took the prescribed treatment at least once. A logistic regression model 
will be used to model the probability  of receiving dabigatran etexilate in comparison to 
vitamin K antagonist, i.e. high propensity  scores, close to 1, indicate a higher probability  of 
dabigatran use. See Section 7.[ADDRESS_87979] a shared range of ePS. 
This patient set is denoted as the restricted patient set in the SEAP .Patients with ePS 
outside the overlapped ePS range will be trimmed (or excluded).  
Safety  anal yses will be conducted for the all eligible treated patient set.
Summary  statistics for continuous variables will include the number of observations (N), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, Q1 (25th percentile), median, Q3 (75th percentile), 
and maximum; tabulations of categorical variables will present all possible categories and will 
display  the number of observations per category  as well as percentages. The default precision 
for percentages should be one decimal place, unless otherwise specified. In general, 
percentages will be based on the number of patients eligible for the particular analysis, 
whether they have missing data or not. A category  'Missing' will be display ed whenever at 
least one patient falls within this category . 
Data collected in the baseline eCRFs (informed consent, patient status, demographics , 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, vital signs and phy sical assessment, clinical signs and symptoms) 
will be considered as respective baseline values. Data collected in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80652]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_80653] -sectional nature, data collected in eCRFs at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80654].

Main outcome events – Incidence rates
For the treatment groups incidence rates with 95% CIs, cumulative risks, and KM curves will 
be calculated on the eligible patient set. Only  patients from the eligible patient set that took 
the 
prescribed treatment at least once are considered. Patients who complete the planned
anticoagulation treatment prior to one year or discontinue initial anticoagulation treatment
permanentl y will be censored at date of last drug intake + [ADDRESS_87982] permanently  stopped initial anticoagulation treatment ifother relevant

The main analy sis of overall incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals, cumulative risks 
and KM curves will be repeated for the subgroups defined in Section 6.4 . A graphical (forest -
plot-like) display  will additionally  be prepared to summarize the subgroup results per 
outcome on the eligible patient 
set. Additional subgroup analyses might be conducted as 
needed .
For all important main and secondary  outcomes for patients initiating VKA at baseline, and 
patie nts initiating DE at baseline, incidence rates, cumulative risks with 95%- confidence 
intervals will be calculated by [CONTACT_3148], and for a graphical comparison Kaplan Meier curves

who never took the prescribed treatment will not be included. Forthe restricted patient set,as 
a sensitivity  analysis, the calculation of incidence rates and cumulative risks will be 
performed without censoring at permanent discontinu ation (intention to treat (ITT) approach). 
KM curves will be plotted.
Secondary and f urther outcome events 
For the further outcome events such as Recurrent DVT and/or PE, VTE -related mortalit y, All -
cause mortality , Life-threatening bleeding events, Acute coronary  syndrome ,and Net clinical 
benefit ,incidence rates, KM estimates and KM curves will be calculated for the eligible 
patient swho took the prescribed treatment at least once for both treatment groups .
Additionally , above analyses will be performed on the restricted patient set .
Technical specifications
Incidence rates per 100 patient years with 95%- confidence intervals for important outcome 
events (single and composite outcome) will be calculated the following way. In addition,
these analyses will be done stratified by [CONTACT_80668]. 
Recurrent events will be disregarded for calculation of incidence rates. Incidence rate λ is 
defined as

where the denominator is the patient years under risk. The 2-sided 95% CI of λ will be 
calculated based on the Poisson distribution and its relationship with the Chi-
square 
distribution according to the foll owing formula [ 7]
[λlower,λupper] = [{0.5χ (α/2;2x) }/n,{0.5χ (1−α/2; 2x+2)}/n],

Cumulative risk is defined as cumulative proportion of patients with event and will be 
calculated as the Kaplan -Meier estimate for failure. The Kaplan -Meier curve will be plotted. 
The proportion of patients with event, as well as the proportion of censored patients falling 
into specified intervals and the Kaplan -Meier estimate for failure will be computed forthe 
following categories:

The ePS is the probability  of a patient being in one of the two treatment groups, conditional 
on relevant observed baseline variables. For this analysis, the ePS for being in the DE group 
vs. VKA group will be estimated using the multivariable logistic regression model. 
Baseline variables will be included in the model based on their known/suspected association 
with the main outcome events. As suggested by [CONTACT_80669], only confounders or variables 
associated with the outcomes will be considered. Table 7.6: [ADDRESS_87983] likely  reason and to

To assess baseline imbalance for the overlap weights by [CONTACT_80671], the mean of each covariate 
of interest will be calculated for patients in each of the treatment groups (DE and VKA) .  
For binary  variables, the proportion will be used instead. For categorical variables with 
more than two categories, dummy  binary  variables will be derived to represent each 
category  and the proportion calculated for each of the treatments.
The standardized differences will be calculated for the mean for each covariate and the

the weighting applied will make the variables continuous. After weighs will have been

These unadjusted (i.e., prior to using the overlap weights with ePS adjustment) and

Balance will then be assessed to determine whether the weighte d covariates procedure 
produces standardized differences for the mean and SD closer to zero (indicating a better 
balance between the study  cohorts) than those of unadjusted covariates. Adjusted 
standardized differences for any covariate that are greater than 0.25 will potentially

Patients who complete the planned anticoagulation treatment prior to one year or 
discontinue initial anticoagulation treatment permanently  will be censored at date of 
lastdrug intake + [ADDRESS_87984] permanently  stopped initial anticoagulation treatment if other 
relevant anticoagulation treatment is initiated or if treatment has been interrupted for 
more than 30 day s
.
Multiple imputation methods (e.g. the fully conditional specification method) will be 
used to impute both continuous and categorical variables appropriatel y with arbitrary 
missing patterns. 
b.)In addition, Cox regression analysis (based on the main analysis model) will be 
performed without censoring at permanent discontinuation (intention to treat (ITT) 
approach).

The same Cox regression model as used for the primary  outcomes will be used for the 
secondary  and further outcomes, if enough events are reported. The ePS overlap weights
analysis on the specific outcome event might be performed for all outcomes. 
7.8 EXPOSURE TIME
Exposure data will be summarized based on the eligible and restricted patient sets for 
dabigatran etexilate and VK A. Prescribed but never taken patients will be excluded from all 
the anal yses described in this section.
The total exposure time will be calculated for each treatment group X as:
Exposure treatment X[days]=last date of treatment intake –first date of treatment intake + 1
The calculated day s are converted to mo n
ths (12*days/365.25) for summary  tables.
In addition, total patient years will be calculated and presented:
Total patient −years treatment X[y ears] = ∑         Exposure treatment X [day s]/365.25 .

7. 9.1 Adverse events
Analy ses for AEs will be based on the all eligible treated patient set. The analy sis of adverse 
event s will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards (see DM& SM: 
Handling and summarization of adverse event data for clinical trial reports and integrated 
summaries [6]). Adverse events will be coded with the most recent version of MedDRA. The 
summary  of standard AE tables will be based on the AE/ SAE CRFs. According to the 
reporting procedures for this study , all SAEs and outcome events are to be documented on the 
SAE or outcome events form irrespective of causal relationship to antithrombotic treatment or 
any other BI drug. Non -serious AEs which are not deemed related to antithrombotic treatment 
or to any  other BI drug should not be included i n the CRF (see stud y protocol, S ection 11.2).
For the analy sis, only AEs which are considered treatment -emergent for antithrombotic 
treatment are included. 
For analy sis of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), all AEs which are related to antithrombotic 
therap y according to the investigators ’judgment are to be included.
The following tables
will be created b y treatment group:
Overall summary  of ADRs.
Frequency  [N (%)] and incidence rate (per 100 patient years) of patients with ADRs 
(related to antithrombotic therap y).
Frequency  [N (%)] and incidence rate (per 100 patient years) of patients with ADRs 
(related to antithrombotic therap y) leading to discontinuation of antithrombotic 
treatment .
Frequency  [N (%)] and incidence rate (per 100 patient years) of patients with ADRs 
(related to antithrombotic therap y) leading to death .
Frequency  [N (%)] and incidence rate (per 100 patient years) of patients with Serious 
ADRs (related to antithrombotic therap y).
Frequency  [N (%)] and incidence rate (per 100 patient years) of patients with fatal
AEs

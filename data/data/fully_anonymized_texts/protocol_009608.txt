1. BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE   
1.1. Background 
Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics is the sponsor of a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, clinical outcomes 
study of the R3 Acetabular System in patients with degenerative hip disease in Europe. The study design included an 
evaluation of the performance of a Biolox delta ceramic-on-ceramic cohort using the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular 
System in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty. The R3 Biolox delta Ceramic Acetabular System has 
been commercially available outside the [LOCATION_002] (OUS) since [ADDRESS_665800]-market study was used to support a 
Premarket Approval (PMA) application that was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 
20, 2015. The clinical data submitted in the PMA application (PMA cohort) included subject follow-up to the 3 year 
postoperative interval. Approval was sought for the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System based upon the PMA cohort 
clinical data. The PMA (P150030) was reviewed by [CONTACT_513793] 17, 2016. The R3 delta Ceramic 
Acetabular System is commercially available in the [LOCATION_002]. A condition of the FDA approval was that Smith & 
Nephew Orthopaedics was required to sponsor a post-approval study (PAS) of the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular 
System in the [LOCATION_002] to address any concerns regarding differences in the US and European patient 
populations.  
 
1.2. Study Rationale 
This study is being conducted to comply with FDA requirements that Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics sponsor a post-
market study of the R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System in the US. 
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES
The primary objective is to confirm that the safety and effectiveness of the R3 Biolox delta Ceramic Acetabular 
System in the US population is consistent with the effectiveness and safety profile shown in the European study 
(PMA cohort).   
 
2.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is overall study success at [ADDRESS_665801] it was in 
the PMA cohort, to allow comparison. Overall success is defined as: 
 
 No component revision,  
 Modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) of at least 80 points, and  
 No radiographic failure, defined as:  
No radiolucencies greater than 2 mm in 50% or more in any of the cup or stem zones, no femoral 
or acetabular subsidence greater than or equal to 5 mm from baseline, and no acetabular cup 
inclination changes greater than 4 degrees from baseline when accompanied by a “Mild”, 
“Moderate”, ”Marked” or “Disabled” mHHS pain score.

4. STUDY DEVICE
The R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System is a ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) hip prosthesis composed of modular 
components that include a R3 porous coated acetabular shell, a zirconia toughened alumina (delta) ceramic 
acetabular liner, and a zirconia toughened alumina (delta) ceramic femoral head and one of four titanium alloy 
femoral stems.  All implantable devices are for single use. 
 
R3 Acetabular Shell/Cup 
The R3 acetabular shells are compatible only with R3 acetabular liners. The R3 acetabular shells are 
manufactured from Ti-6Al-4V (ASTM F 1472 and ISO 5832-3).  There are eleven (11) sizes of acetabular shells 
available, ranging from 48 mm through 68 mm outer diameters in 2 mm increments.  Each shell features an apex 
hole to accept the cup positioner / impactor instrument.  Shells have either no screw holes or three screw holes 
arranged about the apex hole.  These holes are for optional, adjunctive screw fixation to the superior acetabulum 
with Spherical Head Screws, which are available in lengths of 15-70mm in 5mm increments. Screws are self-
tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], but the screw holes in the acetabulum need to be pre-drilled to the minor diameter of the screw.  Hole 
covers are available to cover unused screw holes, if desired.  Screws and hole covers are manufactured from Ti-
6Al-4V ELI (ASTM F 136).  The interior of the R3 Acetabular Shell features a female taper which is designed for 
mechanical assembly to the male taper of the outer titanium ring of the mating R3 delta Ceramic Liner.  The 
outer shell geometry is hemispherical and feature a sintered asymmetric porous coating (STIKTITE™) 
manufactured from commercially pure titanium powder (ASTM F 67 and ISO 5832-2).    
 
R3 Acetabular Liner/Insert 
The delta ceramic acetabular liners are manufactured from Biolox delta zirconia toughened alumina ceramic and 
feature a titanium (ASTM F1472 and ISO 5832-3) outer ring. They are available in ten sizes.   
   
 
Femoral Head 
The zirconia toughened alumina ceramic ball heads are manufactured from Biolox delta zirconia toughened 
alumina ceramic.  The ceramic ball heads are available in six (6) sizes: three (3) heads with an outer diameter of 
32 mm and three (3) heads with an outer diameter of 36mm.  Each diameter head size has three different neck 
lengths, short (+0), medium (+4), and long (+8) for proper anatomic and musculature fit.  Externally, all ball heads

are highly polished.  All ball heads conform to the 12/14 cone taper of the femoral stems.  The zirconia 
toughened alumina ceramic heads lock onto the machined hip stem taper and do not rotate on the stem.  The 
32mm and 36mm delta ceramic femoral heads are used with R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular Liners of 
corresponding internal diameters.  
 
The R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System is approved for use with the 12/14 taper of Smith & Nephew’s legally 
marketed titanium alloy (ASTM F1472) cementless SYNERGY™ porous hip stems (Standard and High Offset 
versions), titanium alloy (ASTM F1472) cementless POLARSTEM™ Collarless Ti/HA hip stems (Standard and 
Lateral versions), titanium alloy (ASTM F1295) cementless SL-PLUS™ femoral stems (Standard and Lateral 
versions), and titanium alloy(ASTM F1472)  cementless ANTHOLOGY™ porous hip stems (Standard and High 
Offset versions). The R3 delta Ceramic Acetabular System product Instructions for Use (IFU) provides femoral 
stem product compatibility information. A copy of the IFU is included in Appendix IV.

6.3. Visit 2: Intraoperative to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513787], component size and device 
identifier, surgical time, and intraoperative blood loss will be obtained. Additionally length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513788]. Any adverse events (complications) occurring from the 
time of study device implant and prior to discharge will be collected and recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
 
Patients will have radiographs taken after implantation (before discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) to establish a baseline. 
All study radiographs (Anteroposterior (AP) pelvis, AP hip, and lateral hip) should be acquired according to the 
Image Acquisition Protocol and will be transmitted to the central imaging vendor for independent review.  
 
6.4. Visit 3: Postoperative  
Postoperative follow-up visits will occur at 3 months (+/- 2 weeks), 1 year (+/- 2 months), 2 years (+/- 2 months) and 
3 years (+/- 2 months) postoperative. Subjects will be evaluated using the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) that 
was used in the original European post-market surveillance study.  The mHHS includes a modification to the 
“Distance Walked” section of the Harris Hip Score to add distances to the choices available, such as indicating the 
number of blocks as a defined distance since the term “blocks” is not commonly used as a measurement of distance 
in Europe. The mHHS should be completed prior to the adverse event assessment when feasible. A copy of the study 
CRFs is included in Appendix III. 
 
AP and lateral radiographs will be taken at these postoperative visits. All study radiographs (AP pelvis, AP hip, lateral 
hip) should be acquired according to the Image Acquisition Protocol. X-rays will be transmitted to the central imaging 
vendor for independent review. Radiographs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_513794] 
& Nephew Radiographic Evaluation Protocol included in Appendix II. 
 
Procedures to be completed at the postoperative visits:  
 
 perform study procedures per study schematic 
 perform required X-rays (see Appendix II for subject positioning details)  
 transmit X-rays to the central imaging vendor 
 obtain and record any adverse events (AEs) occurring from the time of study device implantation  
 collect data per CRF completion guidelines  
 
6.5. Telephone Follow-Up 
If subjects are unable to return for follow-up visits to the Investigator’s office they may be contact[CONTACT_513795]. Subjects will be asked whether the device is in place or has been revised, and asked whether 
any adverse events have occurred since the last visit.

7.1. Screening  
Subjects considered potential candidates for the study based on pre-screening will sign an IRB/EC approved 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to any study activities. The Investigator or delegated study research staff may 
then complete the first study visit with the subject. 
 
7.2. Enrolled Subject 
Subject enrollment occurs at the time of surgery. Every subject that receives the study device will be considered 
enrolled in the study.  If a subject has provided consent and completed screening, and for any reason does not 
receive the study device, the subject will not be considered enrolled in the study. Pre-operative CRFs will not be 
submitted to the Sponsor until the subject is actually enrolled (treated with the study device) in the study.  
 
7.3. Conditions for Study Termination 
All reasonable efforts should be made to retain the subjects for the [ADDRESS_665805] will not be considered enrolled in the study.  For these subjects an End of Study: Subject Disposition form 
needs to be completed and submitted to the Sponsor. Pre-operative, operative, and discharge forms do not need 
to be submitted. 
B. Voluntary Withdrawal 
Study participation is voluntary, and subjects may withdraw at any point during the study without giving their 
reason for doing so.  An End of Study: Subject Disposition form will be completed for all subjects who do not finish 
the study, to document the reason for the withdrawal in the CRF.    
C. Lost to Follow-Up 
Some actively enrolled subjects will not return for follow-up exams due to a variety of reasons.  Study personnel 
must make a reasonable effort to contact [CONTACT_513796] a subject to be lost to follow-up: the subject has been contact[CONTACT_513797], but no 
less than 2 documented phone contacts and 1 certified letter without response. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_513789]/or the attempts to contact [CONTACT_513798], and that documentation should be kept with the subjects CRFs.  A subject will be considered lost to

resulted in a disability or permanent damage (a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, 
damage or disruption in the patient’s body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life);or 
 resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
 required medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or 
prevent permanent damage to a body structure; or 
 does not fit the other outcomes above, but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes.
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without serious
deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event. 
 
C. Adverse Device Effect (ADE) 
An ADE is an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device [2]. 
 
This definition includes: 
 adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, 
installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device 
 any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device. 
 
D. Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) 
A SADE is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse 
event [2]. 
 
E. Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
F. Device Deficiency 
A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, 
safety or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labelling.

8.2. Safety: Investigator’s Responsibilities 
Investigators shall record adverse events and observed device deficiencies, together with an assessment of 
seriousness, severity, and device/procedure relatedness, in the subject’s source data. Following, Investigators are 
responsible for documenting AEs and device deficiencies on the appropriate CRF and submitting them to the 
Sponsor according to the timelines described here below.  
 
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the Investigator must seek information on AEs by [CONTACT_5147], as 
appropriate, by [CONTACT_370768]. AEs must be recorded in standard English medical terminology.  
Unresolved AEs should be followed by [CONTACT_370769], the subject is lost to follow-up 
or through to the end of the study, whichever timing occurs first. Unresolved AEs at the end of the subject’s 
participation will be monitored by [CONTACT_370770]’s normal standard of care. 
 
The Investigator will categorize AEs as mild, moderate or severe based on the following definitions: 
 Mild: the subject is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated.  The event is of little 
concern to the subject and/or little clinical significance.  The event is not expected to have any effect on 
the subject’s overall health or wellbeing. 
 Moderate: the subject has discomfort enough to cause interference with or change in usual activities.  
The event is of some concern to the subject’s health or wellbeing and may require medical intervention 
and/or close follow-up. 
 Severe:  the adverse event interferes considerably with the subject’s usual activities.  The event is of 
definite concern to the subject and/or poses substantial risk to the subject’s health or wellbeing.  The 
event is likely to require medical intervention and/or close follow-up and may be incapacitating or life 
threatening.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391149].   
 
The Investigator is responsible for describing the relationship of the AE to the study device/procedure based on 
the following definitions: 
 Unrelated: the event is clearly not related to the study device or procedure 
 Possible: the event may or may not be related to the study device or procedure.  A relationship cannot be 
ruled out. 
 Definite: the event is clearly related to the study device or procedure. 
 
8.3. Timelines for Submission of Safety Information: 
The timelines begin when the Investigator becomes aware of the event. 
 
The Investigator will report to the Sponsor: 
 
 As soon as possible, but no greater than  24 hours  upon becoming aware of the event, SAEs, SADEs, 
U(S)ADEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE : 
o if suitable action had not been taken

o if intervention had not been made, or 
o if circumstances had been less fortunate 
 Revisions , within 24 hours upon becoming aware of the event. Sponsor will provide an explant retrieval 
kit on becoming aware of a revision and ask the Investigator to return any revised components for 
retrieval analysis. 
 
Investigators may also be asked to supply the Sponsor, upon Sponsor’s request, with any additional information 
related to the safety reporting of a particular event. Investigators will be responsible for complying with the 
adverse event reporting requirements of the IRB/EC at the study site.  
 
8.4. Safety reporting: Sponsor’s Responsibilities 
Sponsor will provide progress reports on safety events to the Investigator to report to the IRB/EC as required. The 
Sponsor will also, in case of SADEs and device deficiencies that could have led to SADEs, determine whether the risk 
analysis needs to be updated and assess whether corrective or preventive action is required. 
 
9. STATISTICAL PROCEDURES  
9.1. General considerations 
Categorical variables will be summarized with the number and percent of subjects in each group. Continuous 
variables will be summarized with the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values.  95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated for the primary and secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint will be 
analyzed using the exact binomial test method. 
 
A complete Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) is included in Appendix IV. 
9.2. Sample size calculation 
The primary objective of this study is to confirm that the safety and effectiveness of the R3 Biolox delta Ceramic 
Acetabular System in the US population is consistent with the effectiveness and safety profile shown in the European 
study (PMA cohort).  The primary endpoint is overall study success at 3 years postoperative.  Secondary endpoints 
include clinical assessments of pain and function, radiographic findings and survivorship. 
 
Overall success (as defined in the section entitled “Data Collection: Study Endpoints”) in the PMA Cohort was found 
to be 86.4% at [ADDRESS_665808]-surgery for the Biolox delta ceramic-on-ceramic (DOD) treatment group.  It is expected 
that the overall success for the DOD US Cohort is similar to the overall success to the DOD PMA Cohort (European 
data).

Potential Complications Associated with Ceramic on Ceramic Hip Systems: 
 
 Due to the materials of the device, these may include, but are not limited to, femoral head breakage, acetabular 
insert (liner) fracture, and device related noise such as squeaking.  Other adverse events, common to other hip 
systems may also occur but at different frequencies. 
 
Possible risks that may occur as a result of study procedures are: 
 
 This study involves the use of x-ray evaluation.  X-ray exposure is cumulative over a lifetime and total exposure 
should be kept to a minimum.  However, if the x-ray exposure when participating in the study is equivalent to 
the exposure the subject would receive if they chose not to participate in the study, there is no additional risk 
associated with this study. 
 As a result of participating in the study there could be a risk of loss of protected subject information 
confidentiality.  All applicable confidentiality standards and data protection and privacy laws will be followed by 
[CONTACT_513800].  Data will be coded and handled only by 
[CONTACT_513801]. 
 
Risks related to the general surgical procedures are not considered here because these could be present regardless 
of participation into the study.

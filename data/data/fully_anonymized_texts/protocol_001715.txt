2 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Early Feasibility Study for Evaluation of the TraceIT Tissue Spacer for 
Creating Space Between the Duodenum and Pancreas in Patients with 
Localized  Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing a Course of Radiation Therapy : 
The TIPS Pi[INVESTIGATOR_499325]:  TraceIT Tissue Spacer consists of a pre -filled glass syringe containing the 
absorbable radiopaque cross -linked polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel 
spacer and a delivery mechanism (syringe and needle) packaged in a single 
use kit.  
 
Indication:  TraceIT Tissue Spacer is a radiopaque hydrogel material intended to 
temporarily position the duodenum away from the pancreas in subjects 
undergoing RT for treatment of pancreatic cancer and in creating this space it is the intent of TraceIT Tissue Spacer to reduce the radiation dose delivered to the duodenum during radiotherapy.  
 When used as a spacer, the TraceIT hydrogel radiographically marks the area for radiotherapy planning and localization.  
 
Study Objective:  To evaluate the feasibility, radiotherapy ben efits, and safety when using 
TraceIT Tissue Spacer to create space between the pancreas and duodenum.  
 
Study Design:  Multicenter prospective , single -arm early feasibility study .  Six (6) subjects 
with localized  (resectable,  borderline resectable or locally advanced) 
pancreatic cancer (defined per NCCN guideline s) having completed 
induction chemotherapy if required and for whom a course of radi otherapy 
(RT) is indicated will be enrolled.  
 
Enrolled subjects  will undergo place ment of  intrapancreatic fiducial  
markers and peri -duodenal administration of TraceI T hydrogel  within the 
same  endoscopic ultrasound transduodenal procedure. The hydrogel will be 
distributed in small volumes (generally ~1 to 2 mL and up to a total of 20 mL) at several areas along the proximal portion of the duodenum in the 
areas closest to the head of the pancreas (HOP) .   
 RT simulation planning will be performed prior to and  following TraceIT 
placement for evaluation and comparison of duodenal dose / dose  
distribution and to assess differences in RT dosing parameters . The pre - and 
post-TraceIT injection simulation planning will be performed using the 
identical technique and similar set-up, and with  appropriate respi[INVESTIGATOR_499326] (e.g., feedback-gui ded inspi[INVESTIGATOR_99807]-hold gating, end 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_499327]).

administration. An MR will be performed  at the 6 month visit to evaluate 
for TraceIT presence.  Throughout the duration of the study, s ubjects will 
be clinically evaluated and assessed for duodenal adverse events using the grading of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4).  Quality of life data will be collected using the  EORTC QLQ-
PAN26 and QLQ-C30 questionnaires.  
 
Additional longer -term follow -up clinic visits will be performed in 
accordance with standard of care , at minimum, 12  and 18 months.  
Safety Endpoints:  Subjects will be monitored for adverse events and radiotherapy ( RT) 
toxicity (using CTCAE v4 ) and in particular for the safety endpoint defined 
as “TraceIT administration procedure-related events which result in a delay 
in initiation of RT” as reviewed and  adjudicated by a Clinical Events 
Committee.  
 
Effectiveness 
Endpoints: Effectiveness endpoints of interest for this study are as follows:  
• Feasibility: Feasibility will be defined to be Technical Success; i.e., 
the ability to place TraceIT and create space between the duodenum 
and HOP.  
• Radiotherapy Benefits: Will be assessed via comparison of pre- and 
post-TraceIT administration RT plans with consideration of the 
following: ability to maintain safe duodenal dose constraints, percent/volume of GTV/PTV  receiv ing prescription dose and 
overall duodenal dose/ dose distribution.  
Additional data collection will include: 
• Incidence of resection  
• Histology of duodenal tissues when resection is performed  
• Incidence of acute (within 3 months) and late (>3 months) duodenal 
toxicity (for unresected subjects)  
• Theoretical dose escalation from post-TraceIT treatment plan  
• TraceIT persistence (at 6- months post -treatment in nonresected 
subjects)  
• Change from baseline in EORTC QoL (QLQ-C30)  and QLQ-
PAN26  
• Comparability of visualization of the fiducial marker and TraceIT 
hydrogel using a standardized visualization score 
• Progression free and overall survival  through follow -up

patients have markedly improved 5- year overall survival (OS) of approximately 20%.  A recent 
study has shown that this outcome may be improved by [CONTACT_1583] a pre -operative  neoadjuvant  
chemoradiotherapy for resectable patients.
4 Neoadjuvant therapy has the advantage of reduc ing 
the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_499323] 15 to 35% of patients.[ADDRESS_642589] unresectable 
disease is associated with dismal 5 -year  OS rates of <5%. However, since the signs and 
symptoms of pancreatic cancer are not usually clinically apparent until the advanced stages, it has 
been reported that, overall, less than 20 to 25% of pancreatic tumors are amenable to resection at 
the time o f diagnosis. 6,7 
 
Among patients with pancreatic cancer, a subset present with borderline resectable pancreatic 
cancer (BRPC), for which neoadjuvant therapy has an established role in obtaining a margin 
negative (R0) surgical resection and thus improving long term survival .8 Additionally, many 
patients present with locally advanced unresectable disease (LAPC) that with the proper 
neoadjuvant treatment could potentially be down-staged to resectable disease. In general, 
neoadjuvant treatment is becoming increasingly explored in hopes of improving the prognosis of 
pancreatic cancer by [CONTACT_499357], reducing tumor volume and increasing the 
likelihood of an R0 resection for both borderline resectable and locally advanced disease.8 
 Thus, current guidelines for the management of patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced disease include single- or multi-agent chemotherapy or chemoradiation (CRT) in 
sequence with chemotherapy .
7 Although results of studies comparing  chemotherapy alone to 
CRT for patients with BR/LAPC have been mixed   10,11,12,13 in some series a mong patients with 
outright unresectable disease, 8% to 30% are converted to a resectable state following 
chemoradiotherapy.  Patients with borderline resectable disease are likely to ultimately undergo 
resection, and thus there is a strong rationale for use of local therapy radiation in addition to 
chemotherapy in these patients.14 
 The importance of local control or delaying local progression on improving morbidity and 
possibly mortality in patients with pancreatic cancer is supported by [CONTACT_499358] 30% of patients die of loca lly destructive disease.
15 It follows then that in the cases of 
BR/LAPC, advanced radiation therapy techniques using dose -escalation with intensity modulated 
radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) are potential strategies to improve local control. However, the tolerance of the surrounding GI tract has historically limited delivering higher doses of radiation therapy to the gross tumor.  
 The majority of pancreatic tumors are in the head of the pancreas. The primary RT dose limiting structure for tumors in the head of the pancreas is the duodenum. The intimate relationship between the head of the pancreas and the duodenum puts this organ at risk for significant radiation toxicity, particularly in co nsideration that chemotherapy regimens used in conjunction 
with RT serve the purpose of increasing radiosensitivity, not just to the tumor, but normal GI

obstructive  jaundice, duodenal hemorrhage and diarrhea among others.16 Indeed, when delivering 
stereotactic doses of radiation in multiple fractions, as is the current convention, and when adhering to contemporary duodenal dose constraints, the rates of medically significant grade ≥3 
duodenal toxicity continues to be a problem reported in up to 15% of patients .
[ADDRESS_642590] from the prostate during 
radiotherapy for prostate cancer. In a prospective randomized (2:1), controlled multicenter study 
evaluating 222 men with clinical stage T1 or T2 prostate cancer, SpaceOAR use was associated with significant rectal dosimetric benefits and reduced rectal toxicity severity as well as a 
decrease in the proportion of patients experiencing declines in bowel quality of life.
 18,19 Thus it is 
believed, that incorporation of application of the TraceIT  Tissue Spacer into the regimen of 
radiotherapy treatment can allow for improvement in RT delivery in multiple aspects including: 1) allowing for safe duodenal dose constraints to be achieved at the target prescription dose; 2) allow for an increase in tumor volume coverage while maintaining acceptable duodenal dose constraints or 3) allow for an individualized dose escalation prescription while maintaining acceptable duodenal dose constraints.  Space creation between the duodenum and HOP may also 
provide a  benefit in reducing incidental radiation to the duodenum due to intra and interfraction 
motion.  
 
Success in any one of the parameters noted above would make TraceIT Tissue Spacer an important tool for the radiation oncologist as they plan and treat patients with cancer of the 
pancreatic head. 
 
4.1 Report of Prior Investigations 
 
The TraceIT Tissue Spacer, which consists primarily of water and polyethylene glycol (PEG) is formulated with constituents that have a long history of safe use in implantable medical devices. Additionally, the materials used in the manufacture of the TraceIT Tissue Spacer have a history of use as FDA approved and cleared degradable implants used adjacent to sensitive tissues (e.g. 
neurological tissues) and the hydrogel material is  currently commercially available to be used for 
tissue marking similar to a fiducial marker. Results of biocompatibility testing demonstrate that 
TraceIT Tissue Spacer meets the requirements specified for a permanent implant (defined as a 
device that remains implanted for greater than 30 days) as delineated in ISO [ZIP_CODE]: Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices. The TraceIT Tissue Spacer has been found to meet its 
performance specifications. Once injected into the body, TraceIT Tissue Spacer has been found  to 
be non-toxic, compatible with surrounding tissues  and degrades within [ADDRESS_642591] components (primarily water and PEG) were chosen for 
biocompatibility. The results demonstrate TraceIT Tissue Spacer hydrogel safety in clinically relevant models.  
 
4.1.1 Pre-Clinical and Clinical Investigations 
Pancreas -duodenum spacing was studied in human cadavers23 as a proof of concept study. Using 
the endoscopic  ultrasound (EUS) approach, TraceIT Tissue Spacer was implanted in the 
pancreas-duodenum interface and adequate space was created.  The TraceIT Tissue Spacer

Rev. C:  March 27, 2019  created adequate space to demonstrate dosimetric advantages, including: limiting radiation dose 
to the duodenum, enhanced coverage of the theoretical tumor and a potential for dose escalation. In a similar porcine study, TraceIT Tissue Spacer was also successfully placed in the pancreas-duodenum interface using an EUS approach
24. The hydrogel was clearly visible on computerized 
tomography (CT) and Cone -beam CT in all the animals that were successfully injected. A mild to 
moderate reactive inflammation isolated to the injection site was observed. Further, this porcine study showed that when TraceIT Tissue Spacer is injected directly into the pancreas, there was no 
evidence of pancreatitis or other adverse events. An equivalent injection was attempted into the duodenal wall to simulate improper injection. Though it was difficult to inject into the duodenal 
wall in the por cine model, when duodenal wall injection was successful, there was no evidence of 
local adverse events. Overall, the gel implants were tolerated well with no related adverse events.  
In a human clinical study, TraceIT hydrogel is being evaluated to access and mark the interface between the pan creas and duodenum using an EUS -guided approach in patients with pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]).  In this study, a small volume of 
hydrogel is injected to mark the interface. The visibility and safety of the hydrogel injection will 
be assessed.

Rev. C:  March 27, [ADDRESS_642592] from the pancreas in subjects undergoing RT for treatment of pancreatic cancer and in creating this space it is the intent of TraceIT Tissue Spacer to reduce the radiation dose delivered to the duodenum during radiotherapy.  
 When used as a spacer, the TraceIT hydrogel radiographically marks the area for radiotherapy planning and localization.  
 
5 STUDY SCOPE AND DURATION  
This is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, single arm, open-label  early feasibility study. 
Six (6) subjects with biopsy confirmed localized pancreatic cancer (AJCC clinical stage IA-III) 
having completed a course of induction chemotherapy and indicated for image -guided 
radiotherapy will be recruited for this study and followed for a minimum of 6 months  after 
injection of the TraceIT hydrogel.  This visit serves as the end of the study for assessing device 
safety . Subjects  will also be required  to return for long -term follow -up for up to 18 months . 
 
Prior to enrollment, potential study candidates will undergo a thorough physical examination and 
documentation of medical/surgical history. A baseline Computed tomography  (CT) simulation 
will be performed by [CONTACT_499359] a baseline RT plan. Subjects  
meeting the study eligibility criteria will undergo trans duodenal  injection of TraceIT Tissue 
Spacer under endoscopic ultrasound guidance  performed by a participating endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_499331].  As part of the subjects’ standard of care, a CT simulation 
scan will be acquired  post TraceIT Tissue Spacer injection. A second radiation treatment plan 
will be generated using this CT simulation scan  and the subject will begin RT for pancreatic 
cancer according to this post-injection plan . During the last fraction of RT , acute duodenal  
toxicity will be scored using CTCAE v4.0  criteria.    
 
Following the course of RT, subjects will be required to return for follow -up evaluations 2-6 
weeks after radiation therapy for a resectability assessment, followed by [CONTACT_499360] 3, 6 , 12 and 18  
months .  
 
The Sponsor will utilize a Clinical Events Committee (comprised of physicians experienced in 
treating pancreatic cancer ) to provide ongoing review and adjudication of adverse events at an 
individual and aggregate level and to monitor emerging data with respect to device effe ctiveness. 
Any seri ous and/or unanticipated adverse events will be submitted for committee  review within 
48 hours of the Sponsor’s receipt of notification of such events so that an evaluation of the risk/benefit assessment of the investigational treatment can be performed.   
The study will be conducted at up to 4 investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002]. Enrollment is 
anticipated to take approximately 3 months. Duration of participation for subjects is 
approximately 22 months.

then be repeated as the needle is repositioned around the target region, injecting TraceIT hydrogel 
at each location  to a total volume of up to 20 mL hydrogel  (40 mL of diluted TraceIT hydrogel in 
a 1:1 ratio) .   
o Note:  If the needle is inserted through the duodenum , but the TraceIT Tissue 
Spacer is no t injected, the subject will be followed for 30 days and included in the 
safety analysis.  No further imaging is required for these “non -injection” subjects.  
 
Following injection of the TraceIT hydrogel, the needle is to be removed, EUS images are to be 
acquired and measurements obtain ed as described above.   
 
The lot number of the TraceIT Tissue Spacer device(s)  used, the number and timing of 
applications is to be recorded on the TraceIT Tissue Spacer Injection CRF.  
 The subject should be assessed for  adverse events during the follow -up period following the 
TraceIT Tissue Spacer injection. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-Injection CT  Scan  Acquisition  
Following the TraceIT hydrogel injection, each subject is to undergo a repeat planning simulation 
scan to obtain a second RT radiation computer treatment plan with the TraceIT Tissue Spacer  in 
situ.  
 
The first and second RT treatment plans (pre- and post -TraceIT Tissue Spacer injectio n) will be 
compared to evaluate the displacing properties of the TraceIT Tissue Spacer.  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_642605] guidelines . Identical treatment planning studies will be performed both before (pre -
TraceIT ) and after (post -TraceIT ) hydrogel injection in each subject.  The technique and setup for 
these two simulation studies should be nearly identical  particularly with respect to patient 
immobilization and respi[INVESTIGATOR_120985] (i.e., active breath -hold method, forced 
shallow breathing with abdominal compression or real -time tracking and/or gating) and beam 
arrangement and angle. Planning set -up/parameters for the pre- and Post -injection RT planning 
will be documented within the CRF.  
The initial minimum target dose  will be 33 Gy in 5 fractions (6.6 Gy per fraction)  or an 
equivalent biologically effective dose if >[ADDRESS_642606] 95%. CT simulation will be performed with 
immobilization  when possible.  
 Normal tissue contours will be performed in accordance with the Upper Abdominal Normal Organ Contouring Guidelines recommended by [CONTACT_941] 2013 RTOG Consensus P anel.

8 RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
8.1 Risk/ Benefit Analysis  
Radiation therapy is a common component of treatment for pancreatic cancer. However, due to 
the pancreas’ anatomic proximity to the duodenum, duodenal radiation injury is a risk of 
radiotherapy. Indeed, when delivering stereotactic doses of radiation in multiple fractions, as is 
the current convention, and when adhering to contemporary duodenal dose constraints, the rates 
of medically significant grade ≥3 duodenal toxicity continues to be a problem reported in up to 15% of patients
17. Since the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_499336], it is understandable that clinicians are seeking technologies that 
can reduce duodenal radiation dose to minimize the risk of duodenal injury associated with 
radiation therapy and maximize the tumor coverage.  
 Based upon the r esults of the preclinical investigations and validated through clinical use, PEG -
based hydrogels have been shown to be safe in multiple tissue types including sensitive neurological and intra -abdominal tissues. The transduodenal injection procedure used for 
administration of the TraceIT hydrogel is commonly performed by [CONTACT_218535][INVESTIGATOR_499337]. Moreover, Augmenix in conjunction with researchers at John Hopkins Medical Center has performed a cadaver study demonstrating that creation of space between the duodenum and pancreas can substantially reduce the level of duodenal radiation exposure  while maintaining or in some cases even  
improving PTV coverage, having a positive impact for both the reduction in duodenal toxicity 
and maximizing effects of RT on the tumor.  Conversely, there is no information in the preclinical data to suggest that the hydrogel material or the methods used for administration present the potential for significant harm when used as intended.   
 Therefore, TraceIT hydrogel when used to displace the duodenum from the pancreas may provide 
a substantial clinical benefit as a duodenal -sparing technology that allows for a reduction in 
duodenal radiation dose and improvement in PTV coverage in patients undergoing radiotherapy 
for pancreatic cancer. It is acknowledged, however, that as with any medical procedure and implanted material there are risks associated with the use and administration of the TraceIT hydrogel.  Based on the clinical knowledge for the device ’s application and preclinical study 
outcomes, potential risks associated with the hydrogel have been identified (outlined below). 
Risks have been mitigated to the extent possible, providing a favorable risk/benefit profile  for the 
TraceIT Tissue Spacer.

8.[ADDRESS_642621] a long history of safe use in implantable medical devices. 
The study sponsor conducted Biocompatibility testing per GLP regulation and in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] – Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices.  Tests were selected and performed 
according to the type of device, intended use, and degree and duration of tissue contact.  The response to TraceIT Tissue Spacer Implants was evaluated in healthy tissues including 
subcutaneous and intramuscular implant locations.  All biocompatibility testing results are consistent with a biocompatible material.  
 Preclinical studies were also done to evaluate the response to TraceIT Tissue Spacer  adjacent to 
the duodenum and pancreas—the intended human implant site.  No adverse histologic change or 
safety concerns were noted.  
 
Based upon the results of the preclinical investigations and validated through clinical use, PEG -
based hydrogels have been shown to be safe in multi ple tissue types including sensitive 
neurological and intra -abdominal tissues. The transduodenal injection procedure used for 
administration of the TraceIT hydrogel is commonly performed by [CONTACT_218535][INVESTIGATOR_499338]. TraceIT hydrogel is FDA 
cleared and has been used commercially for marking purposes in  multiple organs including the 
esophagus20, bladder21 and cervix22. Studies evaluating application of TraceIT in these organs 
reported that the hydrogel remained dimensionally stable throughout the RT course, without migrating through the tissue. These organs, admittedly, have many different properties than the 
interface between the pancreas and duodenum, but TraceIT hydrogel has so far been stable, even 
in highly mobile organs such as the bladder and esophagus.  
 
Appropriate therapeutic intervention following standard medical practices will be used in the event of medical complications. This study will be monitored to ensure the identification, documentation and 
analysis of all adverse events, compliance with the p rotocol, the terms of the participating IRB to 
protect the safety and rights of all subject s, and applicable local regulations.  In addition, risks will be 
minimized through selection of investigators who are Endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_499339] 92462721 A.1 TIPS Pi[INVESTIGATOR_499321]. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Page 49 of 73

Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE):   A serious adverse event that is believed to have been 
caused by [CONTACT_499370].  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE): A ny serious adverse effect on health or safety, 
or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, 
problem or death was not previously identified in nature , severity or degree of incidence in the 
Investigational Plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
Event Severity: Event severity will be gr aded in accordance with the guidelines provided in the  
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4 .0 (NCI, Oct. 2009). For 
those events that do not have a term identified in the CTCAE, events should be identified using 
the following criteria:

9.1.1 Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
All study staff are responsible for ensuring that complete safety information has been recorded on 
the CRF and in source documents. All Adverse Events (AE) must be documented throughout the study.  Medical assessments must be performed during each scheduled study visit and serve as the primary basis for identifying AEs.  Although spontaneous or elicited medical complaints will likely constitute  the majority of AEs, any non -scheduled visit to a healthcare provider or the 
initiation of a new medication should trigger additional questioning as to the occurrence of an AE.  
All adverse events, regardless of severity o r relationship to investigational  device, will be 
collected from the time of initiation of fiducial marker placement and through the 18-month visit.  Subjects who experience an adverse event related to TraceIT hydrogel will be followed until the 
adverse event has resolved or until the sub ject has stabilized and follow-up care has been 
transferred to the subject’ s primary care physician.  
Any changes in a subject ’s condition noted prior to the procedure should be adequately assessed 
and included in the medical history for the subject.  
Any event precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505] a n intestinal acute CTCAE score of grade [ADDRESS_642623] be documented 
as an adverse event.
 
 
To the extent possible, the event to be recorded and reported is the event diagnosis  as opposed to 
event symptoms.  Please refer to the followin g examples:  
 
• Fever, chills, nausea and vomiting in the presence of a clinically diagnosed infection is to be reported as an infection only.  
• Pain on urination in the presence of a clinically diagnosed urinary tract infection is to be reported as a urinary t ract infection only.

Introduction 
 You are being asked to be part of a medical research study.  Before you decide to join, you should read this document.  This is called an informed consent document; it explains what will happen during the study.  Please ask as many questions as needed so that you can decide whether you want to be in the study.   
 You have the right to know what will happen during this study, as well as the possible side effects and benefits of this study.  This document has important information to help you decide if you want to be a part of this study.  Signing the last page of this document will mean that you agree to participate.  
 During the study, you will be told of any important new findings about the study device. You can use this information to decide about continuing in the study.  
 Summary  
 To summarize, consent is being sought for your participation in an early feasibility study. An early feasibility study is a research study of an innovative use of a medical device in a small number of patients to gain initial insights to the basic safety and device functionality.  Participation in an early feasibility study means that you will be one of the first patients to receive treatment with the TraceIT Tissue Spacer, the device being evaluated in this research.

Protocol AGX- 17-001-US 
Rev. C:  March 27, 2019  Specifically, the purpose of this research is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of an 
experimental device called the TraceIT Tissue Spacer. The TraceIT Tissue Spacer is an 
absorbable implant that will be injected between a portion of your small intestine (called the duodenum) and your pancreas to create space between the two organs. The expected duration of 
this study is [ADDRESS_642630] chosen to undergo Radiation Therapy ( RT) with fiducial markers, a common therapy used to treat people with 
pancreatic cancer.  Radiation therapy targets high -energy rays or particles in order to kill the 
cancer cells. RT is a type of radiation therapy where an x -ray of your pancreas is taken in the 
treatment room just before radiation. The fiducial markers, tiny gold seeds placed within the pancreas, show up on this x -ray and will help your doctor see your pancreas before delivering 
radiation. This is important because your pancreas can move every day. This x -ray will be used to 
more accurately target the cancer at each treatment.   Before your first RT treatment, a radiation oncologist will create a treatment plan that will focus 
the radiation on your pancreas and minimize the amount of radiation that will hit healthy organs in the area around the pancreas. You will receive radiation therapy as per the institutional standard that will explained to you by [CONTACT_4904] . During this time, organs that are close to the 
pancreas, such as the duodenum, will be exposed to some radiation. Radiation exposure to the duodenum can cause symptoms such as duodenal bleeding, duodenal stricture, duodenitis, bleeding, obstructive jaundice, and diarrhea. One possible way to reduce the amount of radiation to the duodenum is to place a “spacer” between the pancreas and the duodenum. Placement of the 
spacer may reduce duodenal problems by [CONTACT_499377] (the pancreas) during your radiation treatment.  
 The purpose of this research is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of an experimental device called the TraceIT Tissue Spacer. The TraceIT Tissue Spacer was developed to provide a space between the pancreas and the duodenum during radiation therapy.  The TraceIT Tissue Spacer is 
a soft, gel -like material that is made mostly of water. The gel also contains iodine so your doctor 
can see it on an x -ray. The gel is injected into the space between the pancreas and duodenum 
using an endoscopic needle. The gel will be naturall y absorbed by [CONTACT_499378] 7 
months. This study will evaluate whether the space created by [CONTACT_499379]. The material that the TraceIT Tissue Spacer gel is made from has been  used in other medical implants such as a spacer between the prostate and 
rectum for radiation therapy.

Protocol AGX- 17-001-US 
Rev. C:  March 27, 2019  What will happen during the study  
 
If you choose to participate in this study, the Study Doctor will gather information about you to decide if you meet the requirements of the study.  This is called “screening.” 
 Screening does not guarantee entry into the study.  Entry into the study will depend upon the results of your tests, study guidelines, and the opi[INVESTIGATOR_499342].  Even if you pass the screening tests, there is a chance that you will not be invited to participate.  There may be other reasons why you cannot participate in the study. The Study Doctor and/or the study staff will 
discuss this with you.  
 
During the screening process for t his study you will:  
 
• Provide a complete medical/surgical history  
• Undergo a physical exam and have your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature taken 
• Be asked if you are taking any medications to thin your blood  
• Be asked about your gastrointestinal symptoms  
• Have about 1 -2 tablespoons of blood collected for laboratory testing 
• Have a sample of urine collected for analysis  
• Have a radiation treatment planning session. Prior to this planning session you will undergo a CT scan. This scan takes about one hour  
• Complete the EORTC -QLQ-C30 and QLQ -PAN26 quality of life questionnaires. These 
questionnaires ask you to record your opi[INVESTIGATOR_499343] a complete and honest medical history. Giving false, incomplete, o r misleading information about your medical history could have serious health 
consequences.  
 
Procedure  
 Prior to this procedure, your doctor will give you medicine to put you to sleep. Your doctor will discuss this medication plan with you. A sponsor repre sentative or designee may attend your 
procedure.   Screening for this study will be performed approximately [ADDRESS_642631] scan that may take about  one hour.      
 
Experimental TraceIT Tissue Spacer Injection Procedure  
 
The spacer will be injected between the pancreas and the duodenum using a transduodenal  
approach.  Under endoscopic ultrasound guidance (EUS), a [ADDRESS_642632] been placed ,

Rev. C:  March 27, [ADDRESS_642633] and will take about one hour.   
 
If the TraceIT Tissue Spacer cannot be injected, a second planning simulation scan will not be 
done.  You will be asked to return for a follow -up clinic visit approximately 30 days after the 
procedure.  A physical assessment will be performed to measure your blood pressure and temperature and a Study Doctor will ask you about how you feel.   
 Once the TraceIT Tissue Spacer is placed, it cannot be removed but it will be resorbed in 
approximately 7 months.  
 
RT Therapy  
 
Within 4 weeks of the procedure, your planned radiation therapy will start. You will receive 
radiation treatment for about 2 – [ADDRESS_642634] scan so you can be evaluated for the potential to undergo a surgical procedure called the “Whipple” procedure, a common procedure used to remove tumors in the pancreas. In a standard Whipple procedure, the surgeon removes the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder and part of the 
duodenum. If you are eligible for this surgery, the study doctor will provide you with more 
information concerning the procedure.  
 At each follow-up visit a physical assessment will be performed to measure your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. You will be asked about how you are feeling and any duodenal symptoms 
you may be having. You will be asked if you are taking any medications to treat pain or duodenal 
symptoms. You will a lso be asked if you are taking any medications to thin your blood. The

Side effects and other risks 
 One of the reasons for this study is to learn more about the possible side effects of TraceIT Tissue Spacer. It is important you keep the study staff informed about any possible side effects you may be experiencing.  
The following risks are associated with radiation therapy of the pancreas:  
• Pancreatitis  (inflammation of the pancreas)  
• Duodenal bleeding  
• Duodenal stricture (narrowing of the duodenum)  
• Duodenitis  (inflammation of the duodenum)  
• Bleeding  
• Obstructive jaundice (blockage of bile to the intestines)  
• Diarrhea  
• Nausea/vomiting  
• Abdominal pain 
• Mucositis  (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract)  
 
The following risks are associated with transduodenal placement of fiducial markers:  
 
• Bleeding  
• Pain 
• Pancreatitis  
• Infection  
• Nerve damage 
• Anesthetic related complications 
• Fiducial implant misplacement or migration 
• Foreign body reaction 
• Tumor seeding; e.g., tumor cells are transferred to other tissues near the fiducial marker  
insertion site. 
 If you are treated with the TraceIT gel these are your additional risks, however, since this study represents the first use of the TraceIT gel in patients for tissue spacing there is no information to fully predict the frequency or severity of these risks: 
 
• Pain associated with TraceIT Tissue Spacer injection

Protocol AGX- 17-001-US 
Rev. C:  March 27, 2019  • Pain or discomfort associated with TraceIT hydrogel  
• Needle penetration  of pancreas during injection 
• Injection of TraceIT Tissue Spacer into pancreas, duodenal wall or other organs 
• Local inflammatory reactions  
• Infection  
• IV injection of air/material  
• Duodenal stricture 
• Damage to the tissues of the duodenum including  ulcers or n ecrosis (tissue death)  
• Bleeding  
• Delay in initiation of RT or surgery  
• Potential to protect undiagnosed/microscopic duodenal cancer cells from radiation  
 
The TraceIT Tissue Spacer is completely synthetic and therefore allergic reactions are not 
anticipated.  
 
Although the above risks are possible, the TraceIT gel has been tested in studies in animals and was determined to be safe.   Risks of Radiation Exposure:  
Participation in this research study may involve exposure to radiation from the additional research CT 
scan performed for the purposes of the study. The amount of radiation exposure that you will receive from the extra CT scan is about 1 rem (a unit of radiation exposure) to your abdomen, with minimum exposure of other areas of your body. This amount of radiation is approximately one thousand times 
less than the amount of radiation you will be receiving as part of your cancer therapy. Therefore, the 
risk associated with the additional amount of radiation exposure that you will receive from taking part 
in this study is felt to be very low.

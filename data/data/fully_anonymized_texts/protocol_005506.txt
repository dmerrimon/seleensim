Official Title:  Effect of resveratrol on endothelial 
function in patients with CKD and 
diabetes: A randomized controlled 
trial 
Document Date: 23 February 2024 
 
 
Background and significance  
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an exceptionally high risk for cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and are 10 times more likely to die from CVD prior to requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation 
(1). Multiple studies have shown CKD to be an ind ependent risk factor for cardiovascular events and 
mortality (2 -6). Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of CKD and  is believed to contribute to a 
significant portion of the CVD with CKD (7). Indeed, patients with CKD and diabetes  have a 
disproportio nally higher risk for CVD when compared with patients with diabetes who do not have CKD 
(8). Thus, it is paramount that we explore therapi[INVESTIGATOR_149129] . 
Endothelial dysfunction via brachial artery flow mediated 
dilation (BA -FMD), is a reliable and non -invasive vascular 
assessment, which has been shown to predict CVD 
prospectively in a wide variety of ‘at -risk’ and diseased 
populations, including individuals with CKD (9). Prelimin ary 
data by [CONTACT_149133]-FMD test is significantly lower in individuals with CKD and 
diabetes  as compared to those with CKD but without DM ( Fig 
1). These findings suggest that the etiology of DM within CKD 
patient s appears to exacerbate the condition more so than 
CKD alone.  
Experimental studies,  suggest t hat resveratrol ( a widely -
available nutraceutical ) inhibits inflammation and restores 
endothelial nitric oxide (NO) in vitro (9-11) and in vivo ( 12,13 ).  
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will evaluate if resveratrol supplementation improves endothelial function and 
oxidative stress in those with CKD and diabetes.  
Study  Design  
[ADDRESS_171610] then 
resveratrol in a randomized 
cross over study. Resveratrol 
will be prescribed at 400 mg per 
day. The treatment with 
resveratrol or placebo will be for 
6 weeks and separated by a 2 
week washout period.

Our rational for RSV dose is that : 1) it is available commercially at 400 mg and 2) recent studies utilizing 
RSV suggest that this dose is safe and does not result in serious side effects ( 14, 15).  
The study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov  
Institutional Review Board was obtained. The informed consent will detail the risks associated with the 
study drug and with all the study procedures.  
• Detailed study sessions    
All study procedures will be co nducted at UIHC Clinical Research Unit (CRU)  and all experimental testing 
measurements will be conducted after an overnight fast as well as refraining from exercise  and caffeine 
prior to testing . 
Session 1:  Informed consent and screening questionnaire for inclusion and exclusion criteria includ ing 
confirmation of stage [ADDRESS_171612] at this visit. In addition, all participants will complete a 7 -day physical 
activity recall.  
Session 2 :  
• Blood pressure at rest  
• Endothelial cell sampling  
• Blood sampling for fasting lipid profile  
• Blood sampling for hemoglobin A1C   
• Blood  sampling for levels of RSV  and its metabolites  
• Blood sampling fo r basic metabolic profile and estimated GFR including cystatin C  
• Blood sampling for circulating markers of inflammation and oxidative stress (oxLDL)  
• Urine sampling (random) for albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR)  
• Evaluation of EDD and EID by [CONTACT_149134] -FMD and nitroglycerin -mediated dilation (NMD)  
• Start study drug after this visit  
 
Sess ion 3 : will include the  same measurements as Session 2 . In addition, it will include the following:  
• Physical activity questionnaire  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_692]  
• Safety monitoring:  
o Completion of an adverse event questionnaire  
o Update medication list  
Session s 4 and 5 : will involve the exact same procedures as Sessions 2 & 3 above except it will involve 
the other s tudy drug being ingested for 6 weeks (resveratrol or placebo) . 
• Outcome measurements  
1. Measurements of endothelial dependent and independent dilation :  Endothelial dependent dilation 
(EDD) of the brachial artery (BA -FMD) will be measured at the Cardiovascular Research Lab in the 
Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at the University of Iowa by [CONTACT_22660]  [INVESTIGATOR_149130] -resolution 
Doppler ultrasonography as described originally by [CONTACT_149135] ( 16,17). Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
gated end -diastolic ultrasound images and Doppler flow of the artery will be acquired during baseline and 
FMD and conditions. Briefly, and after [ADDRESS_171613], the vascular reactivity of the 
brachial artery will be assessed as based on the following: 1) two minutes of baseline hemodynamics 
followed by [CONTACT_16131] a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_149131] a pressure of 240 mmHg for 5 min, and 2) rapid deflation of the cuff after 
five minutes. A commercially available software package will be used to acquire and analyze ECG -gated 
brachial artery diameters. Endothelial independent dilation (EID) will also be determined by [CONTACT_149136] 10 minutes after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg). BA -FMD 
(pre- vs. post -intervention) will be calculated as the % change from baseline and compared against the 
placebo condition.  
2.  Systemic markers of oxidative  stress :  oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (ALPCO 
Diagnostics, Catalog #30 -7810) will be  quantified using commercially available enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assays performed according to kit instructions.  
3. Endothelial cell sampling and cell protein expression : This technique will be done by a trained/qualified 
individual at the UI CRU. Briefly, J -wires will be advanced into an antecubital vein and withdrawn. Cells 
will be recovered by [CONTACT_104497] ( 18). Collected cell s will be fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and 
plated on slides. After blocking nonspecific binding sites with 5% donkey serum, cells are incubated with 
the primary antibody and with CY3 -conjugated secondary antibodies. Slides will be systematically 
scanned to  identify endothelial cells (positive VE -Cadherin) and nuclear integrity confirmed using 4',6' -
diamidino -2-phenylindole hydrochloride staining. Once endothelial cells with intact nuclei are identified, 
images will be captured and then analyzed to quantify the intensity of CY3 staining (i.e., average pi[INVESTIGATOR_149132]). Values for each sample will be reported as ratios of endothelial cell protein expression/human 
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) to account for any variation in the staining procedure. Sirtuin 1 
expression will be evaluated since this has been reported to increase with resveratrol.  
4. Other measurements : High performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry will be used to determine plasma and urine levels of resvera trol and its metabolites.  In 
addition, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, serum creatinine and estimated GFR will be assessed at the 
University of Iowa Clinical Lab.  
• Statistical analysis  
Normally distributed data are presented as mean±SD, non -normally dis tributed data as median 
(interquartile range), and categorical data as count (percentage of patients). To determine the effects of 
resveratrol supplementation on our primary and secondary outcomes, a generalized linear mixed 
effects model was used to exami ne the significance of condition, time, and their interaction for normally 
distributed variables, and a gamma mixed effects model was used for non -normally distributed 
variables. In each model, a random intercept was built for each patient to account for i nherent between -
patient variability. A complete case analysis was utilized when analyzing primary and secondary 
outcomes. A Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was used to test differences in resveratrol metabolites between 
the resveratrol and placebo arms. Significanc e was set at an alpha level of 0.05. All analyses were 
performed in R, version 4.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Title of study:   Safety and efficacy of everolimus transition in minimizing progressive 
graft dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis in adult kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_193706] e:  
 
Significant improvements in short term graft survival have been achieved since the introduction of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) mostly due to a decrease in acute rejection rates in 
the first year post-transplantation.
1  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_193707] 
a result of decreased acute rejection rates, commensurate improvements in long -term graft 
survival has  not accrued.2,3  Irreversible and progressive pathologic processes leading to 
graft fibrosis and eventual graft loss are believed to be the destiny of many grafts and many 
mechanisms may underlie graft loss .4 
 Unfortunately, current immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_193708].  A growing  body of evidence demonstrat es associations of 
many immune and non -immune factors that either initiate or participate to some degree in 
this process of inexorable graft fibrosis .
5-7  The development of fibrosis likely reflects the 
dynamic interplay mediating the balance between molecules that are pro-fibrotic (TGF- beta) 
and anti -fibrotic (BMP -7) in their primary action(s) .6  While immune mediated factors like 
cellular and/ or humoral (either subclinical or clinical graft injury) may be initiators of 
fibrogenesis, non immune mediated factors are also likely to be major pathogenic  
contributors in this process .  Of the non- immune factors, CNI nephrotoxicity is known to be 
one of the strongest contributors to non- immune graft injury and fibrosis.[ADDRESS_230184] transplant period. In particular, 
bioavailability of tacrolimus may be lower in significant subsets of populations , such as 
African -Americans , who are more likely to carry the expresser  phenotype for CY P3A5, which 
leads to rapid metabolism of substrates with subsequent reduced exposure.11-13 Recent 
studies  also point to polymorphism in the ABCB1 ( P-glycoprotein) gene as an important 
contributor to the burden of histologic injury , likely as an effect on intra -renal concentrations 
of tacrolimus.14-17 To add a further layer of complexity, certain alleles of the apolipoprotein L1 
(APO -L1) gene in the donor may confer risk for progressive allograft loss independent of 
acute rejection, reflecting either intrinsic proclivity to progressive non- immune injury or an 
inability to fully compensate for or recover from ongoing injury mediated by  [CONTACT_193734] .18,19

ePRISM ID:  IIRP-[ADDRESS_230185] focused on minimizing, avoiding or withdrawing the use of CNIs in renal 
transplantation. De- novo use of CNI -free regimens that used sirolimus (SRL) and 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with cor ticosteroids (CS) met with some success in renal 
transplantation in single center studies.20,[ADDRESS_230186]  that excellent renal func tion outcomes accrue without an  increased risk of acute 
rejection (US 92 study ).
23 However, the enrol lment of higher immunologic risk groups such as 
African -Americans was lower in the context of this study than is the prevalent norm in many 
North American centers such as ours.  
 Studies such as the Rapamune Maintenance Regimen (RMR) study and the Spare the 
Nephron Study (STN) have shown some promise in affording protection of renal function by [CONTACT_193735][INVESTIGATOR_88601] a CNI -based regimen to a  sirolimus, MMF 
and prednisone regimen at a defined point of [ADDRESS_230187] a valuable opportunity to demonstrate absence of acute rejection at the time of minimizing  CNIs . The renal biopsy also yields an excellent baseline estimate of the burden of 
chronic histologic damage. When coupled with an implant biopsy, the rate of change of 
chronic allograft pathology (interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy can also be calculated).
27,[ADDRESS_230188] this hypothesis in the 
context of a randomized, open label,  parallel arm study depi[INVESTIGATOR_193709]. The 
primary, se condary , exploratory objectives and endpoints that will be examined are detailed 
further in subsequent sections .

Objectives:   
Primary objectives:  
1. Measure and compare the change in interstitial fibrosis  (morphometric analysis of 
trichrome stained slides)  at one -year post -transplant in patients converted to 
everolimus, low intensity tacrolimus and prednisone versus the standard  of care  
tacrolimus, myc ophenolate and prednisone regimen.  
Secondary objectives:  
1. Measure and compare the estimated GFR (using the 4- variable modified MDRD 
equation) in patients converted to everolimus, low intensity tacrolimus and prednisone 
versus the standard of care tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone regimen, both 
at one year and two years post -transplant.  
2. Compare the patient and graft survival rates at one- year post -transplant in each 
group.  
3. Measure and compare the rates of immunosuppressant discontinuation and 
modificat ion for each group.  
4. Measure and compare the incidence of significant immunosuppressant -related 
adverse drug reactions for each group. 
5. Compare the rates of post -transplant infections, including CMV, BK, and admissions 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193710] i n each group.

Endpoints 6 through 10 are exploratory:  
6. Measure and compare the rates and quantity of de novo donor specific antibody 
formation at one- year post -transplant in each group; this will address the important 
clinical question of the risk of humorally mediated alloimmune events with CNI 
minimization .  
7. Determine the impact of gene variants for donor APOL1 , donor ABCB1 , recipi[INVESTIGATOR_193711] P450 3A5, and donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_193712].  This endpoint addresses pathways that 
could potentially impact outcome but are not measured by [CONTACT_193736].  
8. Examine changes in gene expression and urinary proteomics using high throughput methods on peripheral blood, renal biopsy tissue and urine. The rationale underlying 
this endpoint is that these markers could yield potential biomarkers  that may be used 
as a companion diagnostic aid in selecting patients at particularly high risk for renal 
progression or CNI nephrotoxicity.   
9. Examine impact of the everolimus based regimen on cardiovascular health as 
measured by [CONTACT_193737]. It is expected that the superior GFR, improved blood pressure and decreased sympathotonia expected with everolimus based tacrolimus 
minimization will improve indices of vascular stiffness and in turn, overall 
cardiovascular health.  
10. An exploratory objective will examine the tissue expression (immunohistochemistry) 
TGF beta (marker of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_193713] (EMT), a precursor of fibrosis and Bone Morphogenetic Protein- 7 (BMP -7; Marker of anti -fibrotic events).  
 
Population:   Sixty adult renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_193714], [ADDRESS_230190] immunosuppressant therapy (control arm) or transition from mycophenolate to everolimus, with a significant reduction in tacrolimus dose and goal trough 
concentrations.   Patients that are screened and consented, but are not randomized to a 
group will be replaced, such that there will be 30 patients in each group.  Once patients are randomized and placed in a study group, they will be followed per study protocol and the 
analysis will occur in an intent -to-treat methodology.

H. Malignancies :   
 
Development of any post -transplant malignancies will be evaluated and recorded up 
to one year post -transplant.  All malignancies, including post -transplant 
lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) will be defined by [CONTACT_193747] .  Immunosuppression regimens may be reduced, 
temporarily held or permanently discontinued as per usual care if a patient develops post-transplant malignancy.  Such decisions will be made by [CONTACT_193748]’s oncologist. 
 
I. Immunosuppressant Side Effects:

J. Gene variant analysis:  
 
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_193722], which is emerging as a rapid and cost effective alternative to commonly used SNP assays such as Taqman SNP and PCR -RFLP 
assays. This work will be performed in the MUSC Proteogenomics Facility, which operates an Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Primer pairs 
flanking the polymorphic positions will be synthesized such that am plicons are 150 -
300bp with SNPs centrally located. Multiplex PCR will be performed for each patient 
sample using the primer pairs in amplification reactions on a Cfx -96 real time PCR 
instrument (Bio- Rad, Hercules CA). Secondary amplifications will be perfo rmed using 
a second series of primers modified to contain 8 -nt barcodes (on the 5’ end of the 
primer) that are unique for each patient. Sequencing adaptors will be ligated onto the purified amplicons using the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit (Life Technologies), and 
the products will be subjected to 200bp template preparation and sequencing on Ion 
314 chips (approximately 10 Mb sequence output) according to Ion Torrent recommendations. Genomic DNA samples will be processed in batches of 30, with 
average sequence length of 200bp, the 30 genomic samples can be sequenced on 
the same 314 chip to achieve an estimated coverage of 100X. Ion sequences will be 
trimmed, filtered, assigned based on barcode, and aligned to the human genome 
using Ion TMAP software. SNP calling will be done on aligned sequence (BAM file) with the Ion DiBayes SNP Detection algorithm run in the “frequentist” configuration.

K. Graft Interstitial Fibrosis:  
Images will be examined with a Nikon E600 microscope, and a Spot Digital Firewire 
camera will be used to capture [ADDRESS_230204] image, the software will sequentially open each 
image, do the analysis, store the data, close the image, and move on to the next 
image until the entire biopsy is analyzed. The operator's only function during the 
analysis phase is to watch the screen and stop the process if an error is detected.  
 
L. Donor Specific Antibodies:  
 Serum samples will be collected and stored at the time of each renal allograft biopsy 
(both protocol based and for cause). DSA screening will be performed using FlowPRA beads representing HLA -A, -B, -Cw, -DR, -DQ and -DP antigens (One 
Lambda, Canoga Park, CA, [LOCATION_003]).   If the screening assay is positive, determination of HLA antibody speciﬁcities will be performed using FlowPRA single antigen class I 
and II beads (One Lambda) and analyzed according to the manufacture’s 
recommendations.  HLA antibody speci ﬁcities will be validated using LABScreen 
single antigen beads using a threshold mean ﬂuorescence intensity ≥300 (One 
Lambda).  
 
M. Gene Expression :  
 All renal allograft biopsies (both protocol based and for cause) will have core tissue 
immediately stabilized in RNAlater
 to prevent mRNA degradation.  These samples 
will be stored at -70º C until processing.  Absolute levels of mRNA will be quantified 
using preamplification -enhanced real- time quantitative polymerase- chain reaction

Everolimus Conversion in Kidney Transplant  Version: 05-Sept-2013  Zortress  
ePRISM ID:  IIRP-1491  
(PCR) assays with the use of oligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probes.  The 
specific mRNA that is quantified will be determined by [CONTACT_193749], as this is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_193723].  At this  time, mRNA targets are proposed to include 
CD3ε, perforin, granzyme B, proteinase inhibitor 9, CD103, IP -10, CXCR3, and 
transforming growth factor β1 (TGF- β1). 
 
N. Urinary Proteomics  
These analyses will be conducted using the algorithms developed by  [CONTACT_193750]. Urine samples will be stored at -80 degree C for proteomic analysis.  
Proteins will be denatured, alkylated and digested with trypsin. Each sample will be 
pre fractionated using offline reversed phase solid phase extraction. Solid phase 
extraction fractions will be analyzed using LC -MS/MS. Tandem mass spectrometry 
will be performed using and AB SCIEX (Framingham MA) Triple TOF [ADDRESS_230205] velocity and vascular stiffness will occur at prespec ified 
time points as delineated in the Study Evaluation Schedule located in the Appendix at 
the end of this protocol (baseline, month [ADDRESS_230206] -transplant).  The 
following procedure will be used to obtain each of these measurements:  After 
participants have rested for at least 10 minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], ar terial 
waveforms at the radial arm (not containing vascular access grafts or fistulas) , 
carotid, or  femoral artery pulses will be  recorded by  [CONTACT_63384]. 
Applanation tonometry will be  performed by [CONTACT_1299] a micromanometer -tipped probe 
against  the skin surface over the artery of interest and obtaining pressure waveforms 
transmitted through the skin surface.  Pressure waveforms will be  recorded during an 
8-second period using a hi gh-ﬁdelity SPC- 301 micromanometer  (Millar Instrument, 
Inc., Houston, TX, [LOCATION_003]) interfaced with a computer employing SphygmoCor, version 
9.0 software (AtCor Medical Pty. Ltd., West Ryde, New South Wales,  Australia).  To 
determine aortic BP, the pulse wave obtained from radial tonometer recordings will be  
calibrated by  [CONTACT_193751] (auscultation) of brachial BP taken  immediately 
before the recordings. The radial pressure  waveform will be  converted into a central 
(aortic) waveform  using a validated generalized  transfer function (GTF) incorporated 
in SphygmoCor software.   Central aortic systolic  and diastolic BP will be  derived from 
the aortic waveform and PPc will be  calculated from the difference.

ePRISM ID:  IIRP-1491  
Safety  Assessment Definitions :   
 
A. Renal Function:   
 
Renal function will be calculated by [CONTACT_193752] 4- variable MDRD formula.  
Time points for calculations are delineated in the Study Evaluation Schedule 
located in the Appendix at the end of this protocol.  The primary renal functi on 
assessments utilized for safety and efficacy analyses will be the eGFR at baseline 
(randomization) and at [ADDRESS_230207] -transplant.  
 
B. Physical Examination:  
 
A thorough physical assessment will be performed at s creening/randomization and at 
months 3, 4, [ADDRESS_230208] -transplant.  Significant findings that are present prior to 
the start of the study will be included in the Relevant Medical History/Current Medical 
Conditions on the CRF. Significant findings made after the start of study medication 
which meet the definition of an AE will be recorded in the AE CRF.  
 
C. Vital Signs:  
 Vital signs (radial pulse rate and blood pressure) will be recorded as indicated in the  
the Study Evaluation Schedule located in the Appendix at the end of this protocol.  
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be assessed at the same arm each time of 
determination and  after the subject has rested in the sitting position (may be supi[INVESTIGATOR_193724]) for  at least five minutes.  Measurements will be recorded on 
the CRF.  
 
D. Height and Weight:  
 
Height and weight will be measured and recorded at s creening and during follow -up 
visits when physical exams are performed.  Results will be recorded on the CRF.  
 
E. Laboratory Evaluations:  
 
All laboratory measurements will be performed at MUSC or referral centers that 
are routinely used as part of usual follow -up care.  Specific information regarding 
the types and schedule of laboratory assessments can be found in the Study 
Evaluation Schedule located in the Appendix at the end of this prot ocol.  
Laboratory measurement results and date of collection will be recorded for the baseline and follow -up time points within the CRFs. Sample collection and 
analysis for the proteomics, genomics and gene expression analyses will be 
conducted as described in the above sections.  
 
F. Pregnancy , contraception and assessment of fertility:  
 Pregnancy testing (serum) will be carried out for all females of child- bearing potential 
as described in in the Appendix at the end of this protocol .  Testing will be part of 
routine follow -up care and will be conducted pre -transplant, within [ADDRESS_230209] -transplant.

Acceptable contraception methods for females of reproductive potential  
 
Option 1 (monotherapy methods):  
1. Intrauterine devices (IUDs)  
2. Tubal sterilization 
3. Patient’s partner had a vasectomy  
 
Option 2 (Choice one from category A AND one from category B):  
1. Category A:  
a. Estrogen and progesterone  
i. Oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_193727]. Transdermal patch  
iii. Vaginal ring  
b. Progesterone only  
i. Injection  
ii. Implant  
c. Barrier method  
i. Diaphragm with spermicide 
ii. Cervical cap with spermicide 
iii. Contraceptive sponge  
2. Category B:  
a. Male condom  
b. Female condom  
c. Diaphragm with spermicide (for use with hormone therapy)  
d. Cervical cap with spermicide (for use with hormone therapy)  
e. Contraceptive sponge (for use with hormone therapy)  
 
G. Choice of Safety measurements:  
 
The safety laboratory assessments (renal function, chemistry, hematology) selected are standard for the kidney transplant population. The blood levels of everolimus and 
tacrolimus  are required for correct control of drug levels and dosing. The assessment 
of (serious) adverse events, including infections, graft loss, death, dialysis and details 
of certain viral infections  (CMV and BKV) allow for proper assessments of safety 
related outcomes and side effects in this  population.

Safety Monitoring:  
 
A. Adverse Events:  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a 
subject or  clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for 
participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally 
associated with the use of a  medicinal (investigational) product. The occurrence of 
adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the subject at each 
visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are 
volunteered by [CONTACT_144970], 
laboratory test, or other assessments.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results 
constit ute adverse events only if they fulfill at least  one of the following criteria:  
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms,  
• they are considered clinically significant,  
• they require therapy.  
 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results should be identified 
through a  review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, 
significant changes from  baseline or the previous visit, or values which are 
considered to be non- typi[INVESTIGATOR_193728]. Investigators hav e 
the responsibility for managing the safety of individual  subject and identifying adverse 
events. Adverse events should be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF with them accompani ed by [CONTACT_6644]:  
• the severity grade : (mild: usually transient in nature and generally not 
interfering with normal activities, moderate: sufficiently discomforting to 
interfere with normal activities, severe: prevents normal activities ) 
• possibility of relationship to the study treatment (no/y es) 
• its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not  
recovered or not resolved should be reported.  
• whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE), if so report date should 
be provided 
• action taken regarding study treatm ent 
• whether other medication or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_95254] (concomitant 
medication/non -drug therapy)  
• its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovering/resolving,  recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown)  
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  Once an 
adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is  judged 
to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if  
necessary).  
 
B. Serious Adverse Event s: 
 
An SAE is any adverse event which meets any one of the following criteria:  
• is fatal or life -threatening 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
Srinivas/Taber   Page 16  
Everolimus Conversion in Kidney Transplant  Version: 05-Sept-2013  Zortress

• leads to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193729] a renal allograft biopsy, renal

Marketing Reporting of Adverse Events 21 CRF 314.80 and 21 CRF 600.80 
http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report/regs.htm .  Any serious adverse event or a 
non-serious adverse event that is related to the study and unexpected will be reported 
to the FDA, per reporting guidelines, as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_230211] be reported to The Medical University of South Carolina IRB within 
10 days per The Medical University of South Carolina IRB Unanticipated Problems 
and Adverse Events Policy and Procedures  reporting gui delines.   
 
C. Pregnancy Reporting:  
 
Any pregnancies  occurring while the subject is on study treatment  will be reported to 
[COMPANY_001] within 24 hr of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed 
up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details  of 
the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, 
or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
 
Statistical analysis:   
 
Categorical data will be evaluated based on Fisher’s Exact and Chi Square tests where 
appropriate; descriptive statistics will be used for continuous variables to describe the two 
patient populations and primary outcomes in each group  (% change in interstitial fibrosis and 
eGFR from month 3 to month 12) . Student’s T -test or comparable non- parametric tests (such 
as the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test) will be used to compare the groups for these continuous 
variables. Patients will be analyzed based on an intent -to-treat basis, except when prohibited 
by [CONTACT_193753] -up [ADDRESS_230212] will be 
used to compare patient and graft survival, acute rejection free survival , and de novo  donor 
specific antibody free survival . A p-value of <0.[ADDRESS_230213] -transplant will be calculated and  
compared as well.   
 For the genomic comparisons, patients will be grouped based on the presence or absence of 
known single nucleotide polymorphisms and compared for primary outcomes.  If significant 
baseline differences are noted between groups, multivariate analysis will be conducted to 
control for these differences.  Similar analyses will be conducted for change in mRNA 
expression and change in urinary proteomic excretion between month 3 and month 12.  
 
This will be an intent -to-treat analysis with all patients undergoing randomization included in 
the final data analysis, even if removed from study or control medication.  Patients screened and consented, but not randomized wi ll be tracked for reasons of non- randomization, but will 
not be followed for clinical outcomes or included in the final analysis.  These patients will be

replaced to insure a total of 60 patients (30 in each group) are randomized and followed to 
meet study  power and sample- size. 
 
Sample size and power :  A total of 60 patients, 30 randomized in each arm, will provide 
89% power (alpha=0.05, two- sided) to detect a significant difference in the percent change in 
the quantity of interstitial fibrosis between groups when comparing the three month and 12-
month protocol biopsies.  These calculations  used the following assumptions:  10% drop out 
rate for each group ([ADDRESS_230214] baseline and follow -up biopsies), with 
a 64±41% change in degree of fibrosis in the control arm and a 13±71% change in fibrosis in the investigational arm.

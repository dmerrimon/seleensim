2.  Backgrou nd: 
 
Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction 
of the nervous system. It is characterized by [CONTACT_19702], ongoing pain, described 
as burning, shooting, prickling or electrical, and/or pain in response to innocuous 
stimuli (allodynia) and exaggerated pain in response to noxious stimuli 
(hyperalgesia)(Benne tt 2010). Neuropathic pain has increasingly been recognized 
as an important contributor to suffering, poor rehabilitation outcomes and reduced 
quality of life of the persons with SCI. Currently, there is no effective 
pharmacological treatment. Surprisingly, only 7% of responders reported 
pharmacological treatment is effective for neuropathic pain following SCI in a postal 
survey (Finnerup et al. 2001a). On the other hand, pharmacological interventions are 
often associated with side effects, such as addiction, withdrawal, and constipation, 
and sedation which may affect participation in rehabilitation and/or life activities, etc. 
Mechanisms of neuropathic pain are not well understood. Pain is multi-dimensional, 
including sensational and affective (i.e., unpleasantness) c omponents. These 
components are processed in parallel, and inseparable to each other (Price 2000; 
Frot et al. 2008). For example, when superficial tactile stimulation is applied to the 
hand area where acupuncture points are located, activation is seen only in 
somatosensory cortices. However, when the acupuncture points are stimulated, and 
pain is experienced by [CONTACT_748], activation of additional cortical areas, such as 
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, is observed(Hui et al. 2000).  Therefore, 
it is impor tant that sensational  and affective components of  neuropat hic pain 
could t heoretically be modulated  separately for therapeutic  purpos es. 
Among various neurostimulation techniques (Kotze and Simpson 2008), including 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)  (Norrbrink Budh and Lundeberg 
2004), electroacupuncture (Ulett et al. 1998), spi[INVESTIGATOR_54185] (Finnerup et al. 
2001b), deep brain stimulation (Murphy and Reid 2001), transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS) (Fregni et al. 2006; Boggio et al. 2008; Boggio et al. 
2009) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique for pain 
management. tDCS uses a small weak current applied through two oppositely 
charge electrodes on the scalp to induce neuroplastic changes that can alter pain 
perception in patients with chronic pain patients, such as SCI patients. Both 
electrodes are connected to a battery-powered device that induces a constant 
electrical current (usually, at 2mA) for approximately 15 to 20 minutes (Moreno- 
Duarte et al. 2014). The analgesic effect of tDCS depends on electrode placement, 
however. In a recent study(Boggio et al. 2008),  anodal tD CS targeting prim ary 
motor cortex  (M1) increases pain as well as sensory perception thre sholds,  
while anoda l tDCS  of dorsal la teral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) only increases pain 
threshold, without altering sensation thresholds. Anodal tDCS targeting M1 is 
believed to specifically  modulate excitability of cortico-thalamic pathways, thus 
altering the sensational component of pain, while DLPFC st imulation arguably 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-14-0564  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  03/07/2016   operates at medial pain pathways through cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical lo op, as 
such attenuating the affective component of the pain (Plow  et al. 2012). In a recent 
review in 2014 (Moreno-Duarte et al. 2014), there are eight clinical trials using 
various neurostimulation techniques for chronic pain management in SCI in the last 
15 years. Among though studies, there were 3 tDCS, two TES (tr anscranial electrical 
stimulation), 2 rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) and [ADDRESS_698457] was heterogeneous. However, SCI patients were “res ponsive” to 
tDCS. F urthermore, the effect was better and longer-lasting when tDCS was 
combined with visual illusion in two studies (Soler et al. 2010; Kumru et al. 2013). 
We recently proposed an innovative treatment – Breathing-controlled electrical 
stimulation (BreEStim) for neuropathic pain management (Li et al. 2012a; Li 2013a). 
This technique was developed from our disc overy of systemic effect of human 
voluntary breathing on motor function and pain perception (Li and Laskin 2006; Li 
and Yasuda 2007; Ikeda et al. 2009; Li and Rymer 2011; Li et al. 2012a; Li et al. 
2012b; Li 2013a), In the BreEStim tre atment (see details in (Li 2013a)), human 
voluntary breathing signal is used to trigger an external electrical stimulator. A 
single-pulse electrical stimulation is then delivered to peripheral acupuncture points. 
After receiving the BreEStim t reatment to the acupuncture points on the ipsilateral 
forearm daily for a week, a patient with constant shooting phantom pain secondary 
to an above-the-knee amputation reported no more  shooting phantom pain, although 
he was still able to feel the shooting sensation occasionally in the phantom limb(Li et 
al. 2012a). 
In the recent study (Li 2013b), an SCI patient (male, 40 years of age, T8 ASIA A 
SCI res ulted from traumatic injury 4.5 years ago) received a 5-day electrical 
stimulation (EStim) treatment first, waited for 1 week for washout, and then received 
a 5-day BreEStim tre atment. The duration of a single electrical stimulus was 0.1 ms. 
Surface electrodes were placed on the right forearm for acupoints (Neiguan and 
Weiguan). BreEStim had a greater pain reduction effect than EStim. Similar to the 
observation in the patient with traumatic above-the-knee amputation (Li et al. 
2012a), BreEStim to acupoints on the forearm was not likely to modify the sources of 
noxious stimuli at the level of SCI (t horacic area) or at the residual limb (i.e., lower 
extremity). Rat her, BreEStim modified h ow patients react to the  noxious stimu li 
at the central level, i.e., the affective response  to the same stimuli. Our case 
reports suggest that patients could tolerate the same noxious stimuli better after 
BreEStim. This is possibly realized by [CONTACT_536379]. In other words, 
BreEStim is likely  to influence the affective component of pain. 
Therefore, we hypothesize that combined tDCS and BreEStim tre atment 
improves pain control by [CONTACT_536380]. 
 
3. Purpose  of the Study: 
In summary, anodal tDCS targeting M1 will be selected since this approach 
influences sensational components of pain perception. BreEStim is  shown to 
modulate the affective component of pain perception. Therefore, we expect that that 
combined BreEStim and tDCS treatment has addictive analgesic effects as 
compared to  BreEStim or tDCS alone. We will test this tre atment in healthy subjects 
and for neuropathic pain management in common patient populations, such as brain 
injury (BI), spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI), and amputation.

4.  Description of  Study: 
 
This study has [ADDRESS_698458] the effectiveness of the new 
intervention for neuropathic pain management for healthy subjects and one patient 
population (SCI,  BI, or amputation) in each experiment. We request to recruit 20 
subjects (5 subjects each group for healthy, SCI, BI and amputation). Overall, We 
plan to adopt recently published BreEStim (Li et al. 2013) and tDCS(Boggio et al. 
2008) research protocols in this experiment. Briefly, this will be a single-center, 
randomized, cross-over trial to determine whether there is additive analgesic effect 
of a single session  of combined and BreEStim and tDCS stimulation in healthy, and 
other patient subjects. 
 
Subject recruitm ent 
A total of 20 patients is planned to be enrolled as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_536373]: healthy, BI, SCI and amputation. The estimated 
number of total patients will be calculated based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_367121] [ADDRESS_698459] if 
they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see subject population). 
 
The inter ventions/Experimental procedures 
 
The experiment consists of 3 sessions, including 1) BreESt im + Sham tDCS (i.e ., 
BreEStim only), 2) BreEStim  +active tDCS, and 3) tDCS only. Three sessions will be 
conducted on three different days with an interval of at least 24 hours. In each 
session, a conditioning tDCS (ac tive or sham) will be performed first, then followed 
by [CONTACT_287271]. 
Anodal tDCS targeting M1 (Boggio et al. 2008) will be used. During each 
session, subjects will receive either active or sham stimulation to M1. A pair of 
surface  sponge electrodes (35cm2) will be soaked in saline and applied to the scalp. 
The anode electrode will be placed over C3 according  to the 10-20 system for EEG 
electrode placement. The reference cathode electrode will be placed over the 
supraorbital area on the opposite side. For all active tDCS conditions, DC will be 
delivered by a specially developed, battery-driven, constant current stimulator 
(Soterix Medical, NY) with a maximum output 
of 10mA. A constant current of 2 mA will be 
applied for 15 min (the effect is usually 
expected to last 1-2 hours after tDCS) 
(Boggio et al. 2008). After the 15-min tDCS  
(active or sham), BreEStim will follow 
immediately.

The same BreEStim protocol (Li et al. 
2013) will be used. Briefly, subjects will wear 
facemask that will be connected to a Pneumotach system to record breathing 
signals. Surface electrodes will be trimmed to be applied to acupuncture points 
(Neiguan and Weiguan) (see Figure for experimental settings). In the BreEStim 
treatment, a single-pulse (0.[ADDRESS_698460]) electrical stimulation is delivered to

5.  Subject Popul ation 
 
In experiments 1-4, 5 subjects for each population (healthy, SCI, BI, and amputation) 
will be recruited and tested. An estimat ed number of patients will be obtained after 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
In experiment 1, healthy subjects will be recruited from residents, staff, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_536374]. The following 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be followed (1) age between 18 and 60 years, (2) no 
clinically  significant or unstable medical, neuropsychiatric, or chronic pain disord er, 
(3) no history of substance abuse or dependence, (4) no use of central nervous 
system-effective medication, (5) no history of brain surgery, tumor, pacemaker, or 
intracra nial metal implantation or atrial fibrillation. 
 
Patient subjects will be recruited from the TIRR outpatient clinic for experiments 
2-4 for a total of 15 subjects. 
 
Inclusion criteria: A patient who 1) has neuropathic pain after traumatic 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_536375]; 2) has chronic pain, >3 
months; 3) is between 18 to 75 years of age; 4) is st able on oral pain 
medications at least two weeks. Patients are allowed to continue their pain 
medications, i.e., no change in pain medications. 
 
Exclusion criteria: Patients will be excluded if they 1) are currently adjusting 
oral pain medications for their neuropathic pain; 2) have pain, but not 
neuropathic, e.g., from inflammation at the incision wound of the residual limb 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-14-0564  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  03/07/2016   or neuroma; 3) have a pacemaker in order to avoid possible  side effects of 
electrical stimulation; 4) have amputation in their arm(s); 5) have SCI 
involving impairment of arms; 6) are not able to follow commands, or to give 
consent; 7) have asthma or other pulmonary disease; 8) are not medically 
stable; 9) have preexisting  psychiatric disord ers; 10) alcohol or drug abuse. 
 
 
6.  Data  Analysis 
Pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements include electrical sensation 
and pain thresholds and warm sensation and heat pain thresholds as used in our 
recent study (Li et al. 2013). In addition, visual analogue scores (VAS), modified 
visual analogue scores (mVAS) will be recorded in patient subjects. These 
measurements will be taken pre- and post-intervention for both sessions. VAS has 
been extensively used and validated (McCar thy et al. 2005). mVAS further quantifies 
the effect of pain reduction by [CONTACT_536381], 
i.e., how much pain was reduced and how long it lasted (reduction × hours). It is 
necessary to note that pain rating is very subjective. This cross-over design uses 
subjects as their own control. 
Heart rate variability as objective outcome measurements 
We have been searching for non-invasive objective pain outcome assessment. Heart 
rate variability has recently recognized a physiologi cal marker for pain assessment 
(Cowen et al. 2015 ), see also Appelhans & L eucken 2008 (both articles are uploaded to 
the iRIS). 
We propose to  add [ADDRESS_698462] repeated measures AN OVA with factors INTERV ENTIONS (3 levels, 
BreEStim only, tDCS only and tDCS+BreEStim) and TIME (pre- and post- 
intervention) will be used determined statistical significance for each threshold 
(electrical s ensation and pain thresholds, and thermal sensation and pain threshold, 
mVAS). It  is expected that BreEStim + tDCS  will have better analgesic effect that 
BreEStim or tDCS alone. 
 
7.  Potential Risks/Discomfor ts: 
 
The risks associated with this study are minimal.  Electrical stimulation has been 
used extensively in clinical s ettings. Patients may feel uncomfortable, or even painful 
during electrical stimulation. The patients will be specifically  instruct ed that they are 
encouraged to increase the intensity of electrical sti mulation to the level they may 
feel uncomfortable, but they need to be able to tolerate at that level if given 
repetitively. They are also explicitly instruct ed to decrease the intensity of electrical 
stimulation if they cannot tolerate it. Surface electrodes can cause skin irritation from 
the tape adhesive or the electrode paste. Breathing through a face mask may be 
make patients feel uncomfortable. All tested subjects in the previous studies 
(approximately 70 subjects, including patients) tolerated the mask well.

8.  Benefits: 
 
There are several potential benefits in this study: 1) direct  benefit to subjects as their 
neuropathic pain may be relieved by [CONTACT_25234]; 2) benefit to the class of 
subjects: other patients in the same patient population may be benefit if the 
intervention is applied to them; 3) adding to the knowledge base: the findings will be 
definitely adde d to the knowledge base. Specifically, the study will provide evidence 
of an alternative and innovative intervention for neuropathic pain management. 
 
9. Risk-benefit Ratio: 
 
In view of the minimal r isk, benefits and the knowledge to be gained far outweigh the 
risks. 
 
10. Consent Procedures: 
 
Informed consent will be obtained from the subject at the Motor Recovery Labo ratory 
(B-107) at TIRR  Mem orial Her mann. After a subject is identified and interested in 
participating, informed, written consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_9137]. 
 
11. Confidenti ality Procedure s: 
 
In order to minimize risk to confidentiality, all data will be de-identified, coded with a 
study specific identification number, maintained on a password-protected server, 
and/or kept in a locked office. No findings will be released without written 
authorization by [CONTACT_423].

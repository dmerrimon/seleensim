Protocol Title:  An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and 
Efficacy of Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_308099] 1 – 6 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection (DORA)
Objective:  Assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of GLE/PIB in pediatric subjects.
Investigator:   Multicenter
Study Site:   Approximately 40 sites globally
Study Population:   HCV genotype 1 – 6-infected pediatric subjects ≥ 3 to < 18 years of age, who are 
either treatment-naïve, treatment-experienced to interferon (IFN – alpha, beta or pegylated interferon [pegIFN]) with or without ribavirin (RBV) or treatment-experienced to sofosbuvir with IFN and/or RBV.  Subjects may be non-cirrhotic or have compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis.  Subjects with 
HCV/HIV-1 co-infection are eligible for study inclusion.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 125 subjects
Methodology:   
The study will enroll approximately 125 HCV-infected pediatric subjects, divided into four (4) age 
groups, 3 to < 6, 6 to < 9, 9 to < 12, and 12 to < 18 years of age.  Enrollment will begin in Part 1 of the study, into the age group 12 to < 18 years old who are willing to swallow the adult formulation of GLE/PIB.  Part 2 of the study will enroll the remaining age groups; those will receive the pediatric formulation of GLE/PIB. 
Within each age group, approximately 12 HCV-infected pediatric subjects will be enrolled for intensive 
pharmacokinetics (IPK) in order to adequately characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a particular age group for dose confirmation, and the remainder of subjects will be enrolled for the evaluation of safety and efficacy of each age group until the total pediatric study population reaches approximately 125 subjects.  Additional PK assessments will be obtained for subjects enrolled in Japan for the purpose of further characterization within Japanese subjects; this is not included within the aforementioned [ADDRESS_376981] been safe and efficacious in adult subjects.  Area under the concentration curve (AUC) will be the primary measure for dose adjustment.  The duration(s) of treatment will be 8, 12, or [ADDRESS_376982] one dose of study drug will be followed for 144 weeks after completing 
or prematurely discontinuing the study treatment to assess long-term safety and durability of SVR
12.

Criteria for Evaluation:
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of GLE and PIB will be determined at each study visit for each subject during the 
treatment period.  A single blood sample will be collected without regard to the time of dosing.  For those participating in the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling, samples will be collected at the Week 2 visit immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_376985] dose.  The pre-dose blood sample (0 hour) will be used for steady state assessment of GLE and PIB.  For subjects enrolled in Japan, additional pharmacokinetic sampling will be collected at the Week 2 visit; samples will either be collected immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_376986] dose, or immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at [ADDRESS_376987] dose.
Efficacy:
Plasma HCV RNA (IU/mL) will be assessed at each  treatment and Post-Treatment Period visit.
Safety:Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902], physical examinations, clinical 
laboratory tests, and vital signs.  Palatability/acceptability, for the pediatric formulation only, will also be assessed.
Resistance:
The polymorphisms at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions at baseline will be tabulated 
and summarized for all subjects receiving study drugs in Part 1.  For subjects in Part [ADDRESS_376988] an HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL, post-baseline substitutions relative 
to the baseline sequence and to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be tabulated and summarized.
Statistical Methods:
Pharmacokinetic:
The primary endpoint will be steady state AUC of GLE and PIB estimated by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental 
pharmacokinetic analysis or population pharmacokinetic analysis, including AUC at Week 2 in subjects with intensive pharmacokinetics samples and AUC in all subjects with or without intensive PK samples.  The main secondary endpoint is C
maxand clearance of GLE and PIB.  Non-compartmental 
pharmacokinetic analysis or population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using intensive or overall pharmacokinetic data to facilitate potential GLE and PIB dose modification in each age group.  The distribution of AUC values for GLE and PIB in each age group corresponding to the final proposed doses will be estimated.  The 95% confidence interval for the geometric mean of AUC values will be calculated.  Other parameters including C
max, Ctrough and clearance will be estimated and summarized for 
each age group, and summarized separately for subjects recruited in Japan.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy:The secondary endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR
12overall and by [CONTACT_551].  The 
percentage will be calculated along with a 2-sided 95% confidence interval calculated using the normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution, unless the number of subjects who fail to achieve SVR 12is 
less than 5, where the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence interval instead.
Additional secondary endpoints include the percentage of subjects who experience post-treatment 
relapse, the percentage of subjects who experience on-treatment virologic failure (i.e., breakthrough or 
failure to suppress at the end of treatment), and the percentage of subjects with new HCV infection (i.e., re-infection) at any time up to the last study visit.
Safety:
The number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_10607] (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term overall 
and by [CONTACT_551].  Laboratory samples will be collected at Baseline, at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 (if applicable depending on treatment duration) and at Post-Treatment Weeks 4 through 144.  Laboratory 
values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be identified, and the percentage of subjects with potentially clinically significant values during the Treatment Period will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_551].  Palatability/acceptability will be assessed for the pediatric formulation only.  Additional summary statistics for safety data will be performed if deemed appropriate.
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drugs in Part 1, and subjects with available samples in Part 2 of the 
study, the polymorphisms at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions at baseline identified by [CONTACT_48832] (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for all subjects receiving study drug who do not 
achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
substitutions in available post-baseline samples identified by [CONTACT_308125], 2) the amino acid substitutions in available post baseline samples at signature [CONTACT_41634]-
associated positions identified by [CONTACT_077], and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral resistance by [CONTACT_077].

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 184 million 
individuals infected worldwide.1  There are 7 identified HCV genotypes, with genotype 1 
(GT1) being the most prevalent worldwide.  HCV genotypes 2 (GT2) and 3 (GT3) infections are more common in Latin America (5% to 30%), Europe (20% to 40%) and Asia (30% to 45%).
2-[ADDRESS_377010] Asia, and GT7 has recently been described in Central Africa.
5
Prevalence data, specific to the pediatric population, is also found in NHANES ( Table 1).  
Prevalence estimates based on diagnosed pediatric cases of HCV infection are a small fraction compared to the overall anti-HCV antibody prevalence in this population, suggesting many children are not diagnosed during childhood.  The most robust estimates from NHANES come from NHANES III, which covered the years 1988 to 1994 where 2,762 and 2,905 children ages 6 to 11 and 12 to 19 years, respectively, were screened.  The prevalence of anti-HCV antibody was 0.2% for children 6 to 11 years and 0.4% for children 12 to 19 years during this timeframe (genotype [GT] was not specified).
6  
Estimates from the 1999 through 2002 NHANES survey also indicate a prevalence of HCV antibody in 6- to 11-year-olds of 0.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04%, 0.6%) and 0.4% (95% CI 0.2%, 0.9%) in 7- to 19-year-olds (GT not specified).
7  Similar low 
anti-HCV antibody prevalence rates of 0.1% were found in a cross-sectional, serologic survey of 1,034 urban children aged 1 to 11 years conducted in the years 2000 through 2002 (GT not specified).
8  In addition, a retrospective evaluation of dried heel stick blood 
spots from 2,806 live births in southern [LOCATION_004] in 2003 found an anti HCV antibody prevalence of 0.25% (GT not specified).

According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the incidence of acute HCV 
infection (confirmed and reported) in the general population in the US was highest (2.4 cases per 100,000 population) in 1992;

relatively stable until 2010, and increased 75% from [ADDRESS_377012] increases occurring in the population aged 0 to 19 years.

The primary differences in HCV infection between adults and pediatrics are differences in 
the mode of infection (e.g., perinatal transmission in children and increased intravenous drug abuse in adults) and natural history of disease.  Studies comparing the natural history of HCV infection in both adults and children have been limited by [CONTACT_25211], with an average sample size of 22 patients.
12  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], progression to advanced liver 
disease appears to be less common in children than in adults, occurring in about 2% of pediatric patients.
13  Duration of infection appears to be an important factor accounting for 
this difference.14  However, when histology was compared between 21 children and 
52 adults, the children had significantly milder histologic disease and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations even after controlling for duration of disease and other potentially confounding variables.
[ADDRESS_377014] 10 years, vertical transmission has become the primary mode of transmission in children, and transmission via transfusion or health care is exceedingly rare in developed countries.
18  Therefore, appropriate serologic and virologic screening of 
infants born to HCV-infected mothers is a cornerstone of early diagnosis.  In infants, the presence of anti-HCV antibody may be due to passive transplacental passage from the 
mother.  Thus antibody testing for perinatal infection is unreliable until approximately 12 to 18 months of age.  In patients with detectable antibody, diagnosis of chronic HCV infection is generally made by [CONTACT_308127] (RNA) for at least [ADDRESS_377015] transient viremia or a resolved infection.  The chronicity rate in perinatal transmission is high; spontaneous clearance generally occurs by [CONTACT_308128], and clearance beyond age 4 is unlikely.
According to the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, 
and Nutrition (NASPGHAN), all children aged 3 to 17 years who are chronically infected

21
with HCV may be considered candidates for treatment, and should be considered for 
treatment if they develop consistently elevated serum aminotransferase levels or liver fibrosis.
19  The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 
recommends that DAA regimens should be recommended independent of disease severity, if a regimen is available dependent upon the child's age group.
30  The combinations of 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, and sofosbuvir + ribavirin have been approved for use in adolescents, though neither combination covers all major genotypes alone.
28,29  To date, 
there are no treatment regimens approved for use in HCV-infected patients aged < 3 years.  There are several studies of interferon-free regimens in children including sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for GT1 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), sofosbuvir (SOF) plus RBV for GT2 and 3 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir for GT1 and GT4 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Results with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy are promising, showing high SVR
12rates in adolescents, similar to adults.  In one clinical 
trial, 100 adolescents with GT1 infection treated with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir achieved an SVR
12rate of 97%.21  A high SVR 12rate of 98% has also been in seen adolescents with 
GT2 and GT3 infection after treatment with SOF + RBV.22
[COMPANY_013] has developed two "next generation" DAAs Glecaprevir (GLE, formerly known as ABT-493), an HCV NS3/4A PI, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (PIB, formerly known as ABT-530), an NS5A inhibitor, for use in combination for the treatment of HCV.  GLE and PIB each have potent in vitro antiviral activity against genotypes [ADDRESS_377017] common resistant-associated substitutions.  Additive or synergistic in vitro anti-HCV activity has been demonstrated 
with the combination of GLE and PIB.  GLE 100 mg and PIB 40 mg are co-formulated into a fixed-dose combination tablet (hereafter referred to as GLE/PIB), which provides adult patients with a convenient once-daily (QD), fixed-dose combination treatment regimen (three tablets QD) to maximize treatment compliance.  A pediatric formulation comprised of film-coated pellets/granules of GLE and PIB, respectively, in a single 
container for a convenient QD oral administration with a dosing vehicle has been developed.

Glecaprevir and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (GLE and PIB)
Overview of GLE/PIB Registrational Phase 3 Program and Supportive Phase 2 
Studies
The GLE/PIB registrational program included a broad subject population including 
subjects with compensated liver disease and subjects with severe renal insufficiency across all genotypes using a single GLE/PIB dose of 300 mg/120 mg QD.  Supportive Phase 2 studies used the Phase 2 formulation of separate GLE and PIB tablets, with each tablet containing 100 mg and 40 mg, respectively.  Treatment arms from these supportive Phase 2 studies using the regimen selected for registrational studies (GLE 300 mg plus PIB 120 mg) were pooled with arms from the registrational studies for analyses of efficacy and safety.  Treatment-naïve (TN) and treatment-experience (TE) subjects to any 
combination of pegylated IFN (pegIFN), RBV, SOF, NS5A inhibitors, or PIs were allowed in the program.  In addition, the program included subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection (Study M13-590), subjects with chronic kidney disease [CKD] Stages 4 – 5, including those on hemodialysis (Study M15-462), subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Studies M14-172, M15-462, and M14-868 Part 3), and subjects with or without cirrhosis who failed a previous regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor and/or an NS3/4A PI (Study M15-410).

The association between baseline polymorphisms and treatment outcome in subjects who 
receive GLE 300 mg QD with PIB 120 mg QD in the registrational or supportive Phase 2 studies was evaluated by [CONTACT_308131].  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted on all baseline samples at 15% detection threshold at key amino acid positions 155, 156, and 168 in NS3, and 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, and 93 in NS5A. 
In subjects who were TN or TE-PRS, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 were detected in 
1.1% (9/845), 0.8% (3/398), 1.6% (10/613), 1.2% (2/164), 41.9% (13/31), and 2.9% (1/34) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6-infection, respectively.  Baseline polymorphisms in NS5A were detected in 26.8% (225/841), 79.8% (331/415), 22.1% (136/615), 49.7% (80/161), 12.9% (4/31), and 54.1% (20/37) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6-infection, respectively.

Amino Acid Substitutions in Subjects Experiencing Virologic Failure
Among TN and TE-PRS subjects with or without cirrhosis treated for 8, 12, or 16 weeks, 
23 subjects experienced virologic failure (2 with GT1, 2 with GT2, and 19 with GT3).  A GT3 infected subject experiencing virologic failure was determined to have been re-infected with GT3a virus distinct from the one present at baseline.  Therefore, baseline polymorphisms and treatment-emergent substitutions were analyzed for 22 subjects experiencing virologic failure. 
Among the 2 GT1-infected subjects, 1 had treatment-emergent substitutions A156V in 
NS3 and Q30R/L31M/H58D in NS5A, and 1 had treatment-emergent Q30R/H58D (while Y93N was present at baseline and post-treatment) in NS5A.
Among the 2 GT2-infected subjects, no treatment-emergent substitutions were observed 
in NS3 or NS5A; the prevalent M31 polymorphism in NS5A was present at baseline and post-treatment in both subjects.
Among the 18 GT3-infected subjects, the majority of subjects had treatment-emergent 
variants at the time of failure in NS3 (61.1%, 11/18) and NS5A (88.9%, 16/18).  Treatment emergent NS3 substitutions Y56H/N, Q80K/R, A156G, and Q168L/R were observed in [ADDRESS_377026]-treatment in 5 subjects.  Treatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28G, A30G/K, L31F, P58T, or Y93H were observed in 16 subjects, and 13 subjects had A30K (n = 9) or Y93H (n = 5) at both baseline and post-treatment.
Integrated Safety Results
A summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) from pooled analyses of the 
registrational studies and supportive Phase 2 studies along with the AEs occurring with a  frequency > 5% are headache, fatigue, nausea and diarrhea (Table 4 ).  The majority of 
subjects experienced an AE, which were mostly considered to be mild in severity by [CONTACT_093] (Grade 1).  Rates of AEs that were serious, led to premature study drug discontinuation or had a severity Grade ≥ 3 were low.  Including data from

The frequency and severity of hepatic-related AEs as well as liver chemistry 
abnormalities evaluating potential hepatotoxicity were low across the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  Liver-related safety results indicated that:
●Four subjects had post-nadir Grade 3 ALT abnormalities or Grade 2 ALT with 
total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN.  None of these subjects prematurely discontinued 
study drug due to an ALT or bilirubin increase.
○ALT abnormalities in 3 of these 4 subjects were not clinically significant.
○One subject experienced concurrent ALT > 3 × ULN (increase from nadir 
grade) and total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN in the context of multiple gallstones 
and was not consistent with drug-induced liver injury.
●Based on exposure-response analyses, no exposure-dependent ALT increases were observed in subjects with ALT abnormalities.
●Grade 3 increases in bilirubin were infrequent (0.4%) and without bilirubin-
related AEs; none were associated with liver disease progression.
●No subjects experienced drug-related hepatic decompensation.  One subject 
with cirrhosis (Study M14-172) who had known esophageal varices 
experienced an epi[INVESTIGATOR_308102].  Treatment was continued without clinical or laboratory signs of liver disease progression.

In summary, GLE/PIB demonstrated a favorable safety profile similar across durations of 
8, 12, and [ADDRESS_377030] and diverse population of subjects, including subjects with cirrhosis, HIV co-infection, and CKD Stage 4 or 5. 
Common study drug-related AEs occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects were headache, fatigue 
and nausea.  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were mostly Grade 1 (mild) in severity.  
Serious AEs and AEs leading to premature study drug discontinuation were rare.

There were no hematological or blood chemistry findings of concern or considered likely 
related to treatment.  Unlike other protease inhibitors, no liver-related toxicities and no cases consistent with drug-induced liver injury were identified.  
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB used 
together for the treatment of those with chronic HCV GT1 to 6-infection in the pediatric population.
Overview of GLE/PIB Phase 3 Clinical Studies in Japan
Two Phase 3 Studies (Studies M15-594 and M15-828) conducted in Japan enrolled 
332 adults with chronic HCV GT1 – GT3 infection who were treated with GLE/PIB 300/120 mg QD for 8 or 12 weeks.  These studies included treatment-naïve, both IFN based-experienced and DAA-experienced subjects, subjects without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis, and with or without severe renal impairment.  A high overall SVR
12rate of 98.3% was observed across DAA-naïve subjects treated with GLE/PIB at 
the recommended durations regardless of HCV genotype or comorbidities (cirrhosis or renal impairment).  In addition, a high SVR
12rate of 93.9% was observed in subjects with 
previous DAA-experience who were treated with GLE/PIB for [ADDRESS_377032] common AEs ( ≥ 5% of subjects) across the two Japan Phase 3 studies were 
nasopharyngitis, pruritis, and headache.  The majority of TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity.  Serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were rare.  No TEAE deemed related to GLE/PIB occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects across the 
two Japan Phase 3 studies.  There were no hematological or blood chemistry findings of concern.  No cases of DILI or hepatic decompensation were identified.  Overall, the type, frequency and severity of AEs in subjects with compensated cirrhosis were similar to subjects without cirrhosis.  In addition, no unique safety signal or toxicity was identified from the use of GLE/PIB in subjects with severe renal insufficiency including those on dialysis.

GLE/PIB Dose Selection Strategy for the Pediatric Population
[COMPANY_013]'s pediatric formulation development strategy is to develop a dosage form that 
provides suitable and flexible dosing across the pediatric age range of 3 to < 18 years.  Development of a suitable pediatric formulation was guided by [CONTACT_308132], dose flexibility, stability, compatibility, and ease and reliability of the manufacturing process.  It is likely the adult tablets will be suitable for adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with weights ≥ 45 kg.  This population is able to swallow tablets 
and utilizing the adult tablet would enable earlier enrollment of this population. In Part 1 of Study M16-123, a total of 47 adolescent subjects received daily administration of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg. PK results showed that the exposures of GLE and PIB in HCV-infected adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age) were similar to the exposures observed in HCV-infected adult subjects following administration of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg.
GLE and PIB exhibit low aqueous solubility.  Due to probable requirement of solvent(s) 
that are undesirable for pediatric patients for any oral solution, and  
 [COMPANY_013] developed a pediatric 
formulation based on the solid oral formulations used to manufacture the adult tablets.  
To provide exposures in pediatric subjects comparable to adult exposures using the pediatric formulation, the GLE and PIB dose in pediatric patients of 3 to < 12 years of agewere revised from originally proposed doses.  Preliminary PK results from the initial 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377034] 2016-004102-34
31
proposed pediatric doses demonstrated that though GLE and PIB exposures were within 
the range of exposure for efficacy and safety in adults for each of the pediatric cohorts, the average exposures in each of the cohorts were lower than the targeted AUC and led to a dose adjustment. Additional subjects were enrolled and the intensive PK results obtained, and additional population PK modeling performed, confirming that the adjusted doses demonstrate exposures that would allow for bridging of adult data, using a 50/20 mg dose ratio.  These doses ( Table 11 ) are proposed to be used in the subjects enrolling in the non-
IPK portion of Part 2, in order to confirm that the doses would provide similar exposures observed in HCV-infected adult subjects, close to the targeted AUC.
3.[ADDRESS_377035] study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB in 
HCV-infected pediatric subjects (under 18 years old).  The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the adult formulation of GLE/PIB will be evaluated in Part 1 in 12 to < 18 years of age who can swallow the adult formulation.  Part 2 will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the pediatric formulation in 3 to < 12 years of age.  The study populations for Part 1 and Part 2 will include GT1 – 6 infected subjects with or without compensated cirrhosis.  Those subjects undergoing intensive pharmacokinetic (IPK) analysis must be HCV treatment naïve and HIV negative.  Subjects who are treatment experienced (prior IFN, peg-IFN, RBV, SOF) and/or co-infected with HIV-[ADDRESS_377036]-Treatment Period for all subjects enrolled.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Efficacy of GLE/PIB has been demonstrated in adult subjects with chronic HCV infection 
within the GLE/PIB Registrational program.  Since there is no difference in disease symptomatology and only minor differences in the natural progression of disease between adults and children, which are largely age related, the effectiveness of GLE/PIB against chronic HCV infection is expected to be similar between the two populations.  Part 1 of 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377037] 2016-004102-34
32
this study encompasses those who are between the ages of 12 to < 18 years of age, and 
who are able to swallow the adult co-formulated fixed-dose tablets.  Eligible subjects will receive GLE/PIB for 8, 12, or 16 weeks depending on HCV genotype, cirrhosis status, and prior treatment experience in accordance with each developmental program (Global and Japan) for the use of GLE/PIB in adults.  Part 2 of this study encompasses those who are between the ages of 3 to < 12 years of age who will take the pediatric formulation.  Study drug duration will be for 8, 12, or 16 weeks depending on HCV genotype, cirrhosis status, and prior treatment experience in accordance with each developmental program (Global and Japan) for the use of GLE/PIB in adults.  
In the pediatric population, the risks associated with GLE/PIB, which have been limited 
and manageable to date, are anticipated to be similar to the adult population.  The efficacy of this regimen has not yet been defined in pediatric populations, and it is possible that the treatment failure rate may be higher than what was observed in the Phase 3 trials in adults.  Adverse events that are known, and those not previously described, may occur with the combination of the two DAAs, as detailed in the informed consent for this study.  In addition, subjects may experience inconvenience or discomfort related to the study visits or study procedures.  Additional safety data for each DAA alone and in combination are detailed above and in the Investigator's Brochure.
Given the potential high SVR rate in populations of HCV-infected subjects, the benefit-
risk profile for co-administered GLE/PIB as treatment for chronic HCV infection is favorable.
3.3 Pediatric Study Plan and Pediatric Investigational Plan
This study design was developed in accordance with the agreed initial Pediatric Study 
Plan (iPSP) and Pediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for GLE/PIB for the treatment of Hepatitis C virus infection (IND Number 127,416, Reference ID:  3959249; EMA reference EMEA-001832-PIP01-15).

The Pediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a 
positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_308103]/PIB on April 29, 2016.  Upon [COMPANY_013] request, a waiver was granted for the pediatric population younger than 3 years of age "on the grounds that the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant benefit over existing treatment for pediatric patients" in this age group.  
Similarly, on July 15, 2016, the FDA confirmed its agreement with the iPSP for GLE/PIB, 
dated June 16, 2016.  In the agreed iPSP, [COMPANY_013] indicated its plans to request a waiver for the pediatric population younger than [ADDRESS_377039] as part of the original New Drug Application (NDA) 209394 (eCTD Sequence 0000).  On August 03, 2017, FDA waived the pediatric requirement for children younger than 3 years of age because the necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (Reference ID:  4134372).

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
The study is designed to enroll approximately [ADDRESS_377042] undergo a mandatory Fibrosis Assessment prior to enrollment into Part 1 or Part 2 of the study (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for more details).
Part 1 of the study allows for enrollment of approximately 44 HCV infected, GT1 – 6 
pediatric subjects into the 12 to < 18 years old age group who weigh ≥ 45 kg and are able 
to swallow (whole tablets – without crushing or breaking) the adult formulation of GLE/PIB.  Part 2 of the study allows for enrollment of approximately 81 HCV infected, GT1 – 6 pediatric subjects divided into the 3 to < 6, 6 to < 9 and 9 to < 12 years old age groups.  Subjects will receive the pediatric formulation of GLE/PIB in Part 2.  
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377043] 2016-004102-34
35
Each age group in Part 1 and Part 2 will enroll approximately 12 HCV infected subjects to 
adequately characterize the pharmacokinetics of a particular age group.  Those individuals will undergo an intensive PK sample draw at the Week 2 visit with blood samples taken immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_377044] six (6) subjects per age cohort complete the intensive PK at the Week 2 visit, the PK samples of those subjects will be analyzed to determine dose adjustments of GLE/PIB in an age cohort, if needed.  After the intensive PK analysis results are available, enrollment will resume with approximately six (6) additional subjects per age cohort and intensive PK of all approximately twelve (12) subjects will be evaluated to determine if the study drug doses have achieved therapeutic exposures which have been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in adult subjects.  Additional subjects may be required for further intensive PK analysis per age cohort if therapeutic exposure targets have not been achieved.  Once doses have been confirmed based on intensive PK data for a respective age group, enrollment into the safety/efficacy portion of that age group may begin.
For each subject enrolled into the intensive PK portion, the initial dose of GLE/PIB will 
be based on the subject's body weight and age at screening ( Table 11 ).  Enrollment will 
first start into the intensive PK portion of Part 1 for the 12 to < [ADDRESS_377045] into the intensive PK portion of each of the Part 2 age groups (3 to < 6, 6 to < 9, and 9 to < 12 years) in parallel.
Enrollment for subjects in Japan in Part 1 and Part 2 will start upon dose confirmation of 
the intensive PK portions of the study.  Eligible Japanese subjects will be given the option to participate in Japan specific intensive PK sampling (J-IPK) to maximize data collection and to better characterize GLE and PIB exposures in children in Japan.  Consent to collect blood samples up to [ADDRESS_377046] dose (0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours) will be requested of all participants from Japan.  However, if patients are not willing to participate in the J-IPK portion of the study then a reduced number of PK samples will be collected at the Week 2

visit immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at [ADDRESS_377048] 2 to 
3 subjects will be enrolled in each of the age cohorts in Part 1 and Part 2 at sites in Japan.
Figure 1. Study Schematic
The intensive PK portions of Part 1 and Part 2 will allow enrollment of pediatric subjects
with or without compensated cirrhosis who are treatment naïve and who meet the weight bands for their age ( Table 11 ).  The HCV genotype must be identified (i.e., Screening 
laboratory result indicating HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6-infection) for those participating in the intensive PK portions of the study.  The safety/efficacy portion of both Part 1 and Part 2 will include pediatric patients with or without compensated cirrhosis that are treatment naïve or treatment experienced (prior IFN [alpha, beta or pegIFN], RBV or SOF exposure), with or without HIV-1 co-infection, or subjects with mixed or indeterminate HCV genotype.  
Pediatric subjects that fall outside of the weight bands for their age ( Table 11 ) may be 
included in the safety and efficacy parts of Part 1 and Part 2 only with approval of the 
[COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director after consideration of risks and benefits.  All 

Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377049] 2016-004102-34
37
subjects will receive GLE/PIB for 8, 12 or 16 weeks, depending on their HCV genotype, 
cirrhosis and prior HCV treatment status.  No dose adjustments of GLE/PIB will be made as a consequence of weight change during the Treatment Period.  For patients with an indeterminate or mixed genotype including GT3, treatment duration will default to the respective GT3 duration based upon treatment-experience and cirrhosis status.  Patients with a mixed GT other than GT3, treatment duration will default to the longer treatment duration based on GT, treatment-experience and cirrhosis status.
Both Parts [ADDRESS_377050] of a Screening Period (Section 5.1.1), a Treatment Period 
(Section 5.1.2), and a Post Treatment Period (Section 5.1.3).  Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue during the Treatment Period in Part [ADDRESS_377051]-Treatment Period will be discontinued from the study.
The pharmacokinetic and clinical data from age groups of 3 to < 6, 6 to < 9, and 9 to 
< 12 years old may be combined for final analyses if exposures from these three (3) age groups are comparable to each other.
In both Parts 1 and 2, for each of the analytes (GLE and PIB), the geometric mean and 
individual AUC values from these pediatric subjects from the Week 2 intensive PK sampling will be compared with the distribution of individual AUCs across Phase 2/[ADDRESS_377052] been safe and efficacious in adult subjects.

M16-[ADDRESS_377053] at the Screening 
Visit for Part 1 or Part 2, parent(s)/guardian(s) must provide written (signed and dated) informed consent and the subject must provide assent (as appropriate for age and country) respectively.
Subjects will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology 
(IRT) system and will undergo the study procedures identified in Section 5.3.1 associated 
with the Screening Visit.  The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_377054]'s medical records.
Eligible subjects have up to 42 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into Part 1 or 
Part 2 of the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening
Subjects who at Screening have any of the following are not eligible to retest or rescreen:
●A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg);
●Hepatitis B DNA > lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ);
●A positive serum pregnancy test (if female).
Otherwise, subjects may be retested or rescreened only once before requiring approval 
from the Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director to rescreen again.
Retesting:
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377055] exclusionary laboratory parameter(s) per Exclusion Criterion 8 
(Section 5.2.2) are allowed to retest on the related panel(s) (e.g., exclusionary albumin 
requires a repeat chemistry panel) within the same screening period and must meet all other eligibility laboratory criteria on the panel that is repeated.  If the retest result(s) are also exclusionary, the subject may only be rescreened or retested again with approval from the Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
Rescreening:
Subjects that exceed the initial 42-day screening period should be rescreened for all 
laboratory and eligibility criteria, not just those that were exclusionary at the first screening attempt (with the exception of HBsAg, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and positive serum pregnancy test) (Section 5.2.2).
The Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director should be contact[CONTACT_308133].  Subjects that are beyond the initial 42-day screening period may still be allowed to enroll within a reasonable time period if they continue to meet all eligibility criteria and have received approval by [CONTACT_308134].  If rescreened, the [ADDRESS_377056]/rescreen, the site personnel must register the subject as a screen failure in both IRT and electronic data capture (EDC) systems.
5.1.2 Treatment Period (TP)
After meeting all the eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled to a study regimen 
according to their genotype, cirrhosis and prior HCV treatment status as shown in Table 5.  
for global subjects and Table 6 for subjects in Japan.  The treatment duration for subjects 
in Japan is consistent with the currently proposed label in Japan.  There are some minor differences from the Global regimen, mostly in subpopulations not common in Japan

[IP_ADDRESS] Prior HCV Therapy
For Parts [ADDRESS_377080] from this study.  Subjects who previously participated in trials of investigational anti-HCV agents may be enrolled if they can produce documentation that they received only placebo or only SOF/RBV.
Subjects could be HCV treatment-naïve or prior treatment experienced.  Prior treatment, 
such as interferons, with or without RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN, is acceptable.  Subjects will be categorized as:
●Treatment-naïve:  subject has never received any treatment for HCV infection.
●Subjects with an allowed prior treatment will be categorized as:
○Non-responder:   HCV RNA detected at the end of a prior treatment 
course (except for breakthrough, which is captured separately).  These 
subjects are further categorized as:
●Null responder:  failed to achieve a 1 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV 
RNA by [CONTACT_10585] 4 or a 2 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA by 
[CONTACT_10585] 12 during a prior treatment course;
●Partial responder:  achieved at least a 2 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV 
RNA by [CONTACT_10585] 12 during a prior treatment course but failed to achieve 
HCV RNA undetectable at the end of treatment;
●Unknown or unable to specify:  insufficient data to categorize as null or 
partial responder.
○Breakthrough:   confirmed ≥  1 log 10IU/mL increase from nadir or 
achieved HCV RNA undetectable (or unquantifiable) during a prior treatment course but HCV RNA was quantifiable during or at the end of 
treatment.

○Relapse:   achieved HCV RNA undetectable at the end of a prior treatment 
course but HCV RNA was detectable following cessation of therapy.
○Other:   subject received a prior treatment course and reason for not 
achieving SVR is other than above.
○Unknown:   subject received a prior treatment course and reason for not 
achieving SVR is unknown.
Subjects must have discontinued prior therapy at least 2 months prior to the Screening 
Visit in order to be eligible for the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Therapy
The investigator should confirm that a concomitant medication/supplement can be safely 
administered with study drugs.  Some medications may require dose adjustments due to the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDI).  
During the Post-Treatment Period, investigators should reassess concomitant 
medications/supplements and subjects may resume previously prohibited medications/supplements or revert to pre-study doses, 14 days following discontinuation of study drugs, if applicable.
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Therapy
Subjects must be able to safely discontinue any prohibited medications or supplements 
listed in Table [ADDRESS_377082] 14 days or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of GLE/PIB and not use these during the entire Treatment Period and for 14 days following discontinuation of study drugs.

Ethinyl estradiol-containing contraceptives
* Some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (including atorvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin) should not be taken with 
the study drugs.  Subjects receiving these statins should either (a) switch to pravastatin or rosuvastatin 14 days or 
10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drugs or (b) may interrupt statin therapy 
throughout the treatment period beginning at least 14 days or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug and until [ADDRESS_377084] dose of study drug, based on investigator's judgment.  If 
switching to or continuing pravastatin or rosuvastatin, it is recommended to either 1) reduce or limit the pravastatin or rosuvastatin dose in accordance with the GLE/PIB product label (if approved in the country); or 2) reduce the pravastatin dose by 50% or limit the rosuvastatin dose to 10 mg QD when taking with the study drug if GLE/PIB is not yet approved in the country.
Use of ethinyl estradiol containing oral contraceptives with GLE and PIB combination 
was associated with ALT increases in some healthy female subjects.  Hormonal contraceptives (including oral, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [including vaginal rings], injectable, or implantable varieties) containing ethinyl estradiol may not be used from [ADDRESS_377085] dose of GLE/PIB until 14 days after the end of GLE/PIB dosing.  Progestin-only contraceptives, such as those containing norethindrone, desogestrel, or levonorgestrel, without ethinyl estradiol, may be used with GLE/PIB.  Hormone replacement therapy i.e., estradiol, esterified or conjugated estrogens, as long as they do not contain ethinyl estradiol, may be used with GLE/PIB at the discretion of the Investigator.
GLE/PIB is not recommended for use in patients requiring stable cyclosporine doses 
> 100 mg per day.  GLE/PIB may be initiated in subjects receiving cyclosporine ≤ [ADDRESS_377086] therapeutic monitoring practices.

●Permanently surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_94399]), or 
●Practicing at least one of the following methods of birth control, starting at 
Screening (or earlier) through at least 30 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743].
●Progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 1 month prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation 
is not the primary mode of action, initiated at least 1 month prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success, and is the sole sexual partner of the 
WOCBP trial participant.
●Intrauterine device (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).
●Male or female condom with or without spermicide.  Condom without spermicide is acceptable only in countries where spermicide is not available.

●True abstinence:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject [periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable].
For Japan specific sites:  Note that both contraceptive sponge and vaginal ring with 
spermicidal jellies or creams are unapproved in Japan.
For male study subjects no contraception is required.
5.3 Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic and Safety 
Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C .
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in Appendix C are discussed in detail in this section with 
the exception of the assessment of concomitant medications (Section 5.2.3), and the 
collection of adverse event information (Section 6.0).  All study data will be recorded in 
the subject's source documentation and then on the appropriate eCRFs, with the exception 
of laboratory data which will be provided to the Sponsor electronically from the laboratory(ies).
Informed Consent/Assent 
Signed study-specific informed consent and assent (as appropriate for age and country) 
will be obtained from the parent(s)/guardian(s) and subject before any study procedures are performed.  If a subject becomes of legal age during the course of the study, the subject will need to be consented using the approved informed consent form.  Details 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377089] dose will be recorded as adverse events.
Vital Signs, Weight, Height and Body Mass Index (BMI)
Body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, body weight, height, and BMI will be measured 
at the visits specified in Appendix C , or upon subject discontinuation.  Blood pressure and 
pulse rate will be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes.  The vital signs performed on Study Day 1 will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.  Height will be measured standing without shoes using a stadiometer.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram
The ECG obtained at Screening will serve as the baseline assessment.  The ECG should 
be performed prior to blood collection.  An ECG can be performed at subsequent visits if deemed clinically necessary.  
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377090] 2016-004102-34

The ECGs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_41596] ("local 
reader").  The local reader from the site will sign, and date ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following categories:
●Normal ECG
●Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant
●Abnormal ECG – clinically significant
Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source.  The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine-generated measurements and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained at a minimum for the clinical laboratory tests outlined in Table 8
at the visits indicated in Appendix C .
An overview about the volume of blood drawn for each of the study visits is listed in 
Appendix D of this protocol.  The Investigator/designee should refer to the local 
recommendations on blood drawn in pediatric patients (e.g., the guide on "Ethical 
Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medical Products With the Pediatric Population" or "Blood Drawing For Human Subject Research" by [CONTACT_39644] ).  The 
Investigator/designee should document exceptions to the local blood loss recommendations in the subject's source along with a justification as appropriate.
At the Study Day [ADDRESS_377091] dose of study drug after the sample is collected (e.g., suggest they bring a light snack).  Fasting status will be recorded in the source documents and on the laboratory requisition.  The baseline laboratory test results for clinical assessment for a particular test will be defined as the last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.

HBsAg and Anti-HBs) and also performed for management of transaminase elevation (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Palatability Questionnaire (Acceptability Questionnaire)
The parent(s)/guardian(s) of the subject will complete a Palatability Questionnaire to 
provide feedback on the perception of the dosage form of the pediatric formulation in Part 2.  The parent(s)/guardian(s) of the subject will be asked of their overall impression towards the dosage form and the administration via dosing vehicle to the subject; such as duration of administration, volume of dosing vehicle, swallowability, and the convenience of administration.  
The questionnaire will be completed at the visits as indicated in Appendix C .  The 
parent(s)/guardian(s) will indicate their answers on the questionnaire, which will be kept 
as part of the study record and transcribed into EDC by [CONTACT_8786].  Site personnel will encourage completion of the questionnaire at all applicable visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items. 
Pregnancy Testing
Females of non-childbearing potential (either pre-menarche and not sexually active or 
permanently surgically sterile as defined in Section 5.2.4) at Screening do not require 
pregnancy testing.  All female subjects who are experiencing menses or are nearing sexual maturation in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], or who are of child-bearing potential:
●A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of 
childbearing potential at Screening.  Additional urine pregnancy tests will be 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377095] 2016-004102-34
58
performed at all visits indicated in Appendix C .  Pregnancy testing is not 
required for females of non-childbearing potential.
●Urine pregnancy testing will be performed on-site during the study visit if 
there is a scheduled visit.  The pregnancy result will be captured in the source 
document and recorded in the eCRF by [CONTACT_8786].  If there is not a 
scheduled study visit, subjects may either have pregnancy testing performed at the site as an unscheduled study visit or a urine pregnancy test may be 
conducted by [CONTACT_41598] a pregnancy test kit provided by [CONTACT_39722].  If a urine pregnancy test is performed at home, site personnel should contact [CONTACT_308136]-related 
pregnancy tests in the source records only.
●If a urine pregnancy result is positive, a confirmatory hCG serum test should 
be collected and sent to the central lab.
Concomitant Medication Assessment
Please refer to Section 5.2.3 .
Hepatitis B and HIV Screen
HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HCV Ab and anti-HIV Ab will be performed at 
Screening.  A positive anti-HIV Ab test must be confirmed for subjects without a previous history of HIV infection.  The investigator or his/her representatives must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject's parent(s)/legal guardian(s).  The site will report these results per local regulations, if necessary.
HCV Genotype and Subtype
Plasma samples for HCV genotype and subtype determination will be collected at 
Screening.  Genotype and subtype will be assessed using the Versant®HCV Genotype 
Inno LiPA Assay, Version 2.0 or higher (LiPA; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY) by [CONTACT_2237].  If the LiPA assay is unable to genotype a sample, its genotype/subtype will be determined by a Sanger sequencing assay of a region of the NS5B gene by [CONTACT_2237].

HCV RNA Levels
Plasma samples for HCV RNA levels will be collected as indicated in Appendix C .  
Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by [CONTACT_187827]®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan HCV Quantitative 
Test, v2.0.  The lower limit of detection (LLOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for this assay (regardless of genotype) are both 15 IU/mL.  
Historical Liver Biopsy or FibroScan or Screening FibroTest
An assessment of liver fibrosis is mandatory prior to enrollment.  Subjects with no history 
of cirrhosis that have not had a liver biopsy within [ADDRESS_377097] be documented as non-cirrhotic or cirrhotic defined as meeting one of the 
following criteria:
Non-Cirrhotic
●A liver biopsy within 24 months prior to or during Screening demonstrating 
the absence of cirrhosis, e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, 
Scheuer, New Inuyama, or Laennec fibrosis score of ≤ 3, Ishak fibrosis score 
of ≤ 4; or
●A FibroScan
®score of < 12.5 kPa within ≤ 6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period; or
●A Screening FibroTest score of ≤ 0.72
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377098] 2016-004102-34

Cirrhotic
●Previous histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis on liver biopsy, e.g., METAVIR, 
Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, New Inuyama, or Laennec fibrosis 
score of > 3, Ishak score of > 4 or on a liver biopsy conducted during Screening; or
●A FibroScan
®score of ≥  12.5 kPa within ≤  6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period; or
●A Screening FibroTest result that is > 0.72.
The resulting cirrhosis status and HCV genotype/subtype will be documented via 
recording in the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system for each subject todetermine the duration and regimen of the study drug for each subject.
For subjects participating in sites specific to Japan, cirrhosis determination may be 
performed (in addition to the methods listed above) using the following Discriminant Score criteria at the time of screening:
●Non-Cirrhotic:  screening Discriminant Score (z) less than zero, according to 
the following formula:  z = 0.124 × [gamma-globulin (%)] + 0.001 × [hyaluronate ( μg × l
–1)] –0.075 × [platelet (× 104cells/mm3)] – 0.413 × gender 
(male, 1; female, 2) – 2.005.
○Subjects with indeterminate Discriminant Score (score = 0), must have a 
qualifying FibroScan®or liver biopsy.
●Cirrhotic:  screening Discriminant Score (z) greater than zero, according to the following formula:  z = 0.124 × [gamma-globulin (%)] + 0.001 × [hyaluronate ( μg × l
–1)] –0.075 × [platelet (× 104cells/mm3)] – 0.413 × gender 
(male, 1; female, 2) – 2.005.

Child-Pugh Score and Category
The Child-Pugh score will be calculated and documented prior to Day 1 visit for cirrhotic 
subjects only.  Subjects who were considered to be non-cirrhotic at the screening visit but identified as cirrhotic (according to definitions listed here) during the screening process will return to the site prior to the Day [ADDRESS_377100] with a Child-Pugh > 6 prior to the Day 1 visit will no longer be eligible for study participation.
The Child-Pugh score uses five clinical measures of liver disease (3 laboratory parameters 
and 2 clinical assessments).  Child-Pugh score will be determined at the screening visit as indicated in Appendix C .  The Child-Pugh score will be automatically calculated prior to 
Day 1 by [CONTACT_30004] (RAVE) once the investigator or designated site personnel enters the subject's parameters (as listed in Table 9).  A total score of 5 – 6 is considered Class A 
(compensated disease); 7 – 9 is Class B (significant functional compromise); and 10 – 15 is Class C (decompensated disease).

HCV Resistance Testing Plasma Sample
A plasma sample for baseline HCV resistance testing will be collected on Day 1 from all 
subjects in Part 1, and from subjects in Part 2 in which the sample for baseline HCV resistance testing will be within the allowable blood volume limits.  HCV resistance testing is required for all subjects who meet virologic failure criteria at the visits indicated in Appendix C .  Specific instructions for preparation and storage of the samples will be 
provided by [CONTACT_2237], the Sponsor, or its designee.
Flow Cytometry, HIV-1 RNA and HIV Resistance Testing Samples
For subjects co-infected with HIV-1, samples for plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and flow 
cytometry (including but not limited to CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell counts [absolute and percent]) will be obtained at the times specified in Appendix C .  Plasma HIV-1 RNA 
will be measured by [CONTACT_291149]/COBAS TaqMan HIV-[ADDRESS_377103], version 2.0 HIV-1 Assay.  Results below the LLOD are reported as:  "Not Detected."
If a subject's HIV-1 RNA level is ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, the subject's HIV-1 RNA is to be 
repeated as noted in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  At the time the repeat plasma HIV-[ADDRESS_377104]'s repeat 
HIV-1 RNA is ≥  500 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, the sample obtained for HIV-1 genotypic resistance 
testing may be analyzed.
HIV-1 protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) sequences, as 
applicable, will be analyzed by [CONTACT_291150]
®Prime drug 
resistance assay.
If the subject's repeat HIV-1 RNA is < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, then the subject will resume 
routine plasma HIV-1 RNA assessments as shown in Appendix C and described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].

Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Instrument (PedsQL)
Subjects will complete the PRO instrument, PedsQL, with the assistance of a 
parent/guardian (where allowed per local regulatory guidelines) on the study days specified in Appendix C .  The PRO should be administered as the first procedure at each 
visit.  Subjects will be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Site personnel will encourage completion of each instrument at all applicable visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items.
The PedsQL Generic Core Scales is a 23 item questionnaire designed to measure the core 
dimension of health as defined by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO), in addition role (school) functioning.  The PedsQL consists of 4 Multidimensional Scales (Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning) and 3 Summary Scores (Total Scale Score, Physical Health Summary Score, and Psychosocial Health Summary Score).  Completion of the PedsQL should take around 4 minutes to complete.  Subjects who are older than 5-years of age and are able to read and understand the questions should complete the questionnaire by [CONTACT_1029].  For subjects who are 5-years of age or younger or who are not comfortable with reading the questions, their parent(s)/guardian(s) should complete the parent/guardian proxy-report.

5.[ADDRESS_377119]-Treatment Period 
or the Long-term Follow-up Period, the procedures outlined for the applicable Premature D/C Visit should be completed as defined in Appendix C .  Ideally for study drug 
discontinuation, this should occur on the day of study drug discontinuation, but no later than 2 days after their final dose of study drug and prior to the initiation of any other anti-HCV therapy.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377120]'s condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be 
treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment and monitored for HCV RNA and the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions in the post-treatment period.  The last dose of any study drug and reason for discontinuation from the Treatment Period will be recorded in the EDC system.
If a subject has an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved laboratory result that is 
significantly outside of the reference range at the time of study drug discontinuation, the investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or adverse event is achieved.
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject 
reports becoming pregnant during the Treatment Period, the DAAs may be continued at the investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject and parent(s)/guardian(s), if the benefit of continuing DAAs is felt to outweigh the potential risk.  Specific instructions regarding subject pregnancy can be found in Section 6.1.6.  Subjects will be monitored for 
SVR in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3.
[IP_ADDRESS] HCV Virologic Failure Criteria
The following criteria will be considered evidence of HCV virologic failure for the 
purposes of subject management: 
●Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV 
RNA measurements of > 1 log
10IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during 
treatment; or 
●Confirmed HCV RNA ≥  100 IU/mL (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements ≥ 100 IU/mL) after HCV RNA < LLOQ during treatment.
When confirmatory testing is required it should be completed as soon as possible and the 
subject should remain on study treatment until the HCV virologic failure criterion has been confirmed.  Subjects meeting a virologic failure criterion will be discontinued from 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]

[IP_ADDRESS] Failure to Maintain HIV Virologic Suppression
HIV-[ADDRESS_377122]-
Treatment Period, as detailed in Appendix C .
The criteria for failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression among subjects on stable ARTs is as follows:
●HIV-1 RNA ≥  200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL confirmed on [ADDRESS_377123] compliant with their HIV ART therapy.
At the time a confirmatory HIV-1 RNA is drawn, a sample for HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing should also be obtained; this sample may be analyzed if the subject's repeat plasma HIV-1 RNA is ≥  500 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.  A subject should remain on HCV study drug treatment 
and his/her current ART regimen while the failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression is being confirmed.  A confirmatory HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 genotypic resistance blood draw can be done as an unscheduled visit.  However, if this blood draw falls on the date of 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377124] 2016-004102-34
74
a scheduled study visit ( Appendix C ), only a single HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 genotypic 
resistance blood draw needs to be performed at this visit.  
During the Treatment Period, subjects with confirmed failure to maintain HIV-1 RNA 
suppression should continue study drug treatment unless there is a requirement for prohibited concomitant medications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) to construct a new HIV ART 
regimen.
Clinical management of failure to maintain HIV-1 virologic suppression during the study 
(Treatment Period and Post-Treatment Period) will be handled by [CONTACT_308142].  
If the investigator wishes to change the HIV-[ADDRESS_377125] be 
discussed with the [COMPANY_013] Study Designated Physician prior to the change being made, unless the change is being made to address an immediate safety concern.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to [COMPANY_013] in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by [CONTACT_26257].  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety reasons, [COMPANY_013] will immediately notify the investigator by [CONTACT_26258].

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design
The combination regimen of GLE/PIB completed registrational Phase [ADDRESS_377136] been optimized in adults.  These same durations and regimens are anticipated to be similarly successful in children as long as the drug exposures are comparable, so further regimen/duration exploration is not warranted.  In addition, no interferon-free regimens or ribavirin free regimens are approved for use in children less than 12 years old; the historical standard of care (pegIFN/RBV) has notably lower efficacy rates and a worse safety profile than the interferon-free DAA regimens and requires longer treatment duration, making a comparative study unethical and difficult to enroll.  A non-randomized study design with regimens/duration and drug exposure comparable to the recommended adult regimens is the best method for evaluation.
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377137] Population
This is a multicenter, Phase 2/3, open label study in treatment naïve and treatment 
experienced HCV GT1 – 6 infected pediatric subjects, with and without compensated cirrhosis, with or without HIV-1 co-infection, designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of GLE/PIB administered QD for 8, 12 or 16 weeks.  Evaluation for the treatment duration is supported by [CONTACT_308146].  Evaluation of the dosages to be used in this population is supported by [CONTACT_308147], based on multiple Phase 1 and 2 studies, with modeling to support the intended pediatric dosing. 
This study plans to enroll subjects from ≥ 3 to < 18 years old with genotype 1 – 6 HCV 
infection as agreed upon in the Pediatric Investigation Plans (PIP) and Pediatric Study 
Plan (PSP).  The older subjects who are willing to swallow the adult formulations and are ≥ 45 kg will be studied using the adult co-formulated tablets.  A pediatric formulation of the DAAs has been developed for children in the ≥ 3 to < 12 year old age groups.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
In the PIP and the PSP for Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761], the proposed pediatric doses were targeting providing comparable exposures to adult subjects.
[COMPANY_013] has developed a separate pediatric formulation for GLE + PIB for use in Part 2 of 
the present study.  
The mg doses for a given weight range for each of the age groups as proposed in the PIP 
and PSP were adjusted to express each age group dose as a multiple of a proposed unit 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]

dose of a sachet, which provides a simplified dosing approach for patients and physicians 
and is expected to help reduce potential dispensing and dosing errors while meeting the objectives of the weight based dosing.  Given the wide therapeutic window of GLE and PIB, the updated doses will not anticipate to change the efficacy/safety profiles.
For the present study, the final proposed doses by [CONTACT_308148] 11.

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity 
management) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.

M16-[ADDRESS_377144]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.

6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4).
The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI CTC AE for a given diagnostic/symptomatic AE term to identify and apply specific grading details for that AE entity.
Grading System for Adverse Events (a semi-colon indicates 'or' within the description of 
the grade).
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL*
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL**
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
ADL = Activities of Daily Living
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable Possibility An adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
For serious adverse events, if an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] "no reasonable possibility of 
being related to study drug" is given, an "Other" cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_093].
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events as well as protocol-related non-serious adverse events 
(e.g., infection at liver biopsy site) will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until study drug administration.  From the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_377147]-Treatment Period, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (non-serious 
AEs will not be collected).
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by [CONTACT_26280] (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE
®system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented 
on the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.

investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject, if the benefit of continuing 
therapy is felt to outweigh the risk (Section 5.4.1).  If a subject is discontinued, the subject 
will be monitored for SVR in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.4.1.
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected for pregnancies occurring up to [ADDRESS_377154] be evaluated by [CONTACT_093].  All adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be managed and followed to a satisfactory clinical resolution.  Toxicity is deemed "clinically significant" based on the medical judgment of the investigator.  The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is to be used in the grading of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities which is available on the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf.
Specific toxicity management guidelines apply to the instances of increases in ALT 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Adverse Events
If a subject experiences a severe adverse event (Grade 3+) or a serious adverse event that 
the investigator considers to have a reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug, the investigator should assess whether the adverse event can be managed medically without interruption of study drug, or whether study drugs should be interrupted until the event improves.  If study drugs are interrupted and restarted and the adverse event recurs, then study drugs should be permanently discontinued.
If a subject experiences a severe adverse event (Grade 3+) or serious adverse event that is 
considered unrelated (no reasonable possibility) to the study drugs, it is not necessary to interrupt study drugs unless an interruption is required because of the nature of the event (e.g., unable to take oral medications).
The investigator should ensure that all serious adverse events are reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of awareness.  Serious adverse event follow-up information, including associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations), must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_41619].
Severe adverse events and any associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations) should 
be entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of ALT Elevations
If the ALT increase is confirmed to be > 5 × ULN which is also > 2 × baseline value, the 
recommendations below should be followed:
●Evaluate for alternate etiology of ALT elevation; document in the source, 
update the medical history and concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable), 
and obtain additional testing as appropriate.
●Evaluate for a new viral hepatitis infection, including hepatitis A, B and E.
○If the subject is found to have an active hepatitis B infection, additional 
evaluation by [CONTACT_308150].
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377157] 2016-004102-34
93
●Manage the subject as medically appropriate.
●Repeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and 
international normalized ratio (INR) within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
●Discontinue study drugs if any of the following is observed at any time:
○ALT level is ≥ 20 × ULN in the absence of an alternate etiology.
○Increasing direct bilirubin or INR or onset of symptoms/signs of hepatitis.
○At the discretion of the investigator.
Alternate management of ALT increases is permitted with approval of the Primary 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
If the investigator wishes to pursue alternative management of study drugs in the setting 
of confirmed ALT increases described above, then approval of the Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director must be obtained.

8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The analysis of pharmacokinetic endpoints will be performed when 12 subjects complete the 2 week intensive PK (IPK) measurements, and these analyses will be done within each age group.  For subjects enrolled in Japan, the pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized separately.
The efficacy, durability of response, resistance, growth and development, patient-reported 
outcomes, and safety analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_18669] (across Parts 1 and 2 combined).  
The first interim analysis will occur once all subjects participating in IPK in Part [ADDRESS_377161] interim analysis will occur once all subjects participating in the IPK portion in Part 2 complete PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinue from the study.  A fourth interim analysis will occur once all subjects in 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377162] 2016-004102-34
96
Parts 1 and 2 complete PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinue the study.  Final analysis 
will occur after the completion of the whole study.
SAS®(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) for the UNIX operating system will be used for all 
analyses.  All statistical tests and all confidence intervals will be two-sided with alpha 
level of 0.05. 
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
drug.
Demographic and efficacy analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population defined as all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug, unless otherwise specified.
Sensitivity analyses of the SVR
12endpoint, when applicable, will be performed on the 
intention-to-treat population modified to exclude subjects who did not achieve SVR 12for 
reasons other than virologic failure (mITT-VF).No data will be imputed for any efficacy or safety analysis except for analyses of SVR 
endpoints (HCV RNA data).  HCV RNA values will be selected for the analyses of all SVR endpoints (e.g., SVR
4, SVR 12, and SVR 24) based on defined statistical visit 
windows.  A backward imputation method will be used to impute missing responses for SVR analyses.  Detailed statistical methods for all endpoints will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
8.1.[ADDRESS_377163]'s age group might be summarized separately.  The baseline value refers to the last non-missing measurement collected before the first dose of study drug is received in Part 1 or Part 2.  Demographics include age, birth year, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), BMI z score (BMI z score will be calculated using WHO published BMI-for-age

health, as well as role (school) functioning.  The PedQL consists of 4 multidimensional 
scales (Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning) and 3 summary scales (Total Scale Score, Physical Health Summary Score, and Psychosocial Health Summary Score).
Across subjects enrolled in Part 1 and 2 (based on ITT population), summary statistics of 
change from baseline (n, mean, SD, minimum and maximum) of 3 summary scale scores will be provided by [CONTACT_18669].  In addition the same summaries will be created separately for subjects who complete all the questionnaires by [CONTACT_308155](s)/guardian(s) always complete the parent/guardian proxy-report.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug through [ADDRESS_377174]-study drug dosing) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_41631] (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events by [CONTACT_479] (Grades 1 – 5) and relationship to study drug also will be provided.

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Data
Clinical laboratory tests will be summarized at each visit.  The baseline value will be the 
last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.  Mean changes from baseline to each post baseline visit will be summarized descriptively.
The number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-specified 
criteria for toxicity grades during treatment will be summarized.
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs Data
Mean changes in temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, weight, height, 
and BMI from Day [ADDRESS_377176] baseline visit will be summarized descriptively. 
8.1.6 Resistance Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS] HCV Drug-Resistance Analyses
The secondary endpoint of resistance associated viral variants will be analyzed as follows.  
For all subjects in Part 1 and subjects with available samples in Part 2, full length NS3/4A or NS5A from baseline samples will be sequenced by [CONTACT_077].  For all subjects who experience virologic failure (on-treatment virologic failure or post-treatment relapse), full length NS3/4A and NS5A genes from the first sample after virologic failure with HCV RNA ≥  1000 IU/mL will be sequenced by [CONTACT_077].  An appropriate subtype-specific 
prototypic reference sequence will be used for comparison with sequences from samples.  Subjects treated with study drug who do not achieve SVR
12due to reasons other than

discontinuation, will have the sample at that time point sequenced. 
Only samples with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL will undergo sequence analysis 
in order to allow accurate assessment of products of amplification.  Therefore, if the 
HCV RNA level at the time of HCV virologic failure or treatment discontinuation is < 1000 IU/mL, the sample closest in time after HCV virologic failure/treatment discontinuation with an HCV RNA level ≥  1000 IU/mL will be used.  Included time

●Baseline polymorphism:  an amino acid polymorphism by [CONTACT_187828] a baseline 
sample (≥ 2% or ≥  15% prevalence within a subject's viral population 
depending on polymorphism frequency threshold utilized) that was not present 
in the appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA

HCV Genotype/Subtype
Phylogenetic analysis will be conducted on HCV NS3/4A and/or NS5A sequence from 
baseline samples from subjects in Part 1, and from subjects with available samples  in Part 2 in order to accurately determine genotype/subtype.  If the phylogenetic analysis is not available, then the result from Sanger sequencing of a region of NS5B by [CONTACT_308161]'s HCV genotype/subtype, if available.  Finally, if neither the phylogenetic analysis result nor the Sanger sequencing assay results is available, then the Inno-LIPA assay results from the Central laboratory will be used to categorize the subject.  This information will be presented in summaries of efficacy subgroup analyses.
[IP_ADDRESS] HIV Drug-Resistance Analyses
If a subject develops a confirmed, plasma HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 500 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL after

M16-[ADDRESS_377182] modeling approach with the NONMEM software.  The structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of data from previous studies.  Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of the PK analytes will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of major interest in the NONMEM analyses.  If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis.  
Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error 
structure) is developed, empi[INVESTIGATOR_308112].
Relationship between exposure and clinical observations (antiviral activity) will be 
explored.  Exposure-response relationships for primary and secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored.  
The relationship between exposure (e.g., population pharmacokinetic model predicted 
concentrations over time or average concentrations or AUC or trough concentrations of the individual model-predicted pharmacokinetic profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and antiviral activity will be explored using graphical and/or logistic regression analyses. 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377183] 2016-004102-34

Additionally, relationship between exposure and efficacy/safety endpoints of interest may 
also be explored.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
It is planned to enroll a total of approximately 125 subjects into this study.  The primary 
endpoint will be steady state AUC of GLE and PIB.  Practical considerations include the expected larger number of adolescents within this population, in comparison to the younger age cohorts.
The proposed sample size of 48 subjects (12 subjects for each age cohort) for intensive 
pharmacokinetic sampling (separate from sampling performed in subjects in Japan) is expected to adequately characterize the pharmacokinetics of GLE and PIB to enable dose selection in pediatric subjects. 
Approximately 10 subjects will undergo additional PK sampling to support 
characterization of GLE and PIB exposures in children from Japan.
Additional subjects will be enrolled to reach the proposed total of 125 subjects to provide 
safety and efficacy information.
8.3 Randomization Methods
There is no randomization in this study.  Enrolled subjects will receive treatment per the 
planned study schematic outlined in Section 5.1.2.

Section 3.0  Introduction
Subsection GLE/PIB Dose Selection Strategy for the Pediatric Population
Previously read:
[COMPANY_013]'s pediatric formulation development strategy is to develop a dosage form that 
provides suitable and flexible dosing across the pediatric age range of 3 to < 18 years.  
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_377227] 2016-004102-34

Development of a suitable pediatric formulation was guided by [CONTACT_308162], dose flexibility, stability, compatibility, and ease and reliability of the manufacturing process.  It is likely the adult tablets will be suitable for adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with weights ≥ 45 kg.  This population is able to swallow tablets 
and utilizing the adult tablet would enable earlier enrollment of this population.
GLE and PIB exhibit low aqueous solubility.  Due to probable requirement of solvent(s) 
that are undesirable for pediatric patients for any oral solution, and  
, [COMPANY_013] developed a pediatric 
formulation based on the solid oral formulations used to manufacture the adult tablets.  
Current dose selection strategy for the purposes of this protocol is based on BSA 
normalization and age appropriate scaling.  The objective was to select a dose for each age group in mg that provides exposures in the target range shown to be safe and efficacious in adults based on the formulation available currently.  Clinical trial simulations have been performed to assist in dose selection in the pediatric population.  From the clinical trial simulations performed at the proposed GLE and PIB doses in the pediatric population, summary statistics for each age group for GLE and PIB and the percent of subjects with exposures ≤ 0.5× and ≥  2× the target AUC were estimated and 
are shown in Table 5.

At the doses listed in Table 5, the geometric mean and median exposures are comparable 
within each age group for GLE and PIB.  The variability in each age group is expected to be similar to the variability observed in adults.
The doses shown in Table 5 are based on currently available clearance data in adult 
subjects with HCV infection in Phase 2 studies.

and utilizing the adult tablet would enable earlier enrollment of this population. In Part 1 
of Study M16-123, a total of 47 adolescent subjects received daily administration of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg. PK results showed that the exposures of GLE and PIB in HCV-infected adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age) were similar to the exposures observed in HCV-infected adult subjects following administration of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg.
GLE and PIB exhibit low aqueous solubility.  Due to probable requirement of solvent(s) 
that are undesirable for pediatric patients for any oral solution, and  
 [COMPANY_013] developed a pediatric 
formulation based on the solid oral formulations used to manufacture the adult tablets.  
To provide exposures in pediatric subjects comparable to adult exposures using the pediatric formulation, the GLE and PIB dose in pediatric patients of 3 to < 12 years of agewere revised from originally proposed doses.  Preliminary PK results from the initial proposed pediatric doses demonstrated that though GLE and PIB exposures were within the range of exposure for efficacy and safety in adults for each of the pediatric cohorts, the average exposures in each of the cohorts were lower than the targeted AUC and led to a dose adjustment. Additional subjects were enrolled and the intensive PK results obtained, and additional population PK modeling performed, confirming that the adjusted doses demonstrate exposures that would allow for bridging of adult data, using a 50/20 mg dose 
ratio.  These doses ( Table 11 ) are proposed to be used in the subjects enrolling in the non-

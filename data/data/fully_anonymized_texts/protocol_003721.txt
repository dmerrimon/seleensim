Background  The value of clinical cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) within healthcare settings has been established in the last decad. CPET methods remain highly relevant in the COVID-19 endemic phase and should be used to assess those recovering from COVID-19 infection. This diagnostic tool could play an integral role in disease prognostication and evaluate the integrative response to incremental exercise. Date from such assessments can enable practitioners to characterise cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_527713]-respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]. More than 50% of patients admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527714]. In this context, measurements obtained from an assessment of cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_527715]-vascular interface and characterisation of any impairment or abnormal cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]. Current approaches to rehabilitation are being developed on existing knowledge from Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (SARS) and Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS) related illness. These provide important insight but do not provide insight into the novel challenges provided by [CONTACT_4113]-19.  We bring together three clinical and academic research centres from around the world that collaborate as part of the Healthy Living for Pandemic Event Protection international network to conduct a minimum of 150 2-day CPET tests in patients that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527716]-19.

[COMPANY_009] Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 13         4.1 Baseline Clinical Data Data collected will include demographics, the pre-admission symptoms, pre-admission therapy, preadmission exercise tolerance and performance status (retrospective assessment by [CONTACT_5363]/or representative 6 weeks preceding admission) level of educational attainment, past-medical history, time and route of admission, and in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527724] (including heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7146]). Blood biomarkers that are part of clinical profiling such as CRP, total blood count, D-Dimers and IL-[ADDRESS_685167] (30mins) exercise bouts..   4.1.1 Anthropometrics (Session 1) Participants will be asked to provide an approximate date of onset of COVID-[ADDRESS_685168] received any COVID-19 vaccinations and the manufacturer of the vaccine. Body Mass (kg) and height (m) will be assessed.  4.1.2 Questionnaires [IP_ADDRESS] Symptom Profile Symptom profile will be measured twice at the baseline assessment (Day 0), to capture a) retrospective assessment by [CONTACT_527760] (essentially their baseline symptoms), and b) their current symptom status at the point of testing.  [IP_ADDRESS] Quality of Life The EQ-5D-5L is routinely used in the assessment of the quality of life in respi[INVESTIGATOR_527725] 130 languages (EQ-5D-5L). It comprises five dimensions (Previously 3): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  [IP_ADDRESS] Sleep Behaviour Participants will complete the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI).

The measure consists of 19 individual items, with a 0-3 interval scale and creates 7 components that produce one global score. The PSQI is reliable and valid in the assessment of sleep problems.  [IP_ADDRESS] Fatigue Fatigue is a common complaint in patients recovering from an acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_527726]. Participants will complete 2 separate measures of fatigue at Visit 1 and Visit 2); (A) the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), a self-reported questionnaire validated to assess presence and severity of fatigue; and (B) MFI-20. A 20 item self-reported questionnaire assessing fatigue across five aspects.  [IP_ADDRESS] MRC Dyspnoea Scale The Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Scale (MRC) is a measure to grade the effect of breathlessness on the person’s daily activities. The MRC is simple to administer and is a short 1-5 stage scale (1 item) and allows the person to state the extent to which their breathlessness affects their mobility.  [IP_ADDRESS] Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) Scale The Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) Scale will be assessed upon discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527727]-to-face visit to monitor direct recovery and to assess functional sequelae. The PCFS will evaluate the ultimate consequences of COVID-19 on functional status and supplement other instruments that measure quality of life, tiredness, or dyspnoea in the acute phase. The PCFS covers the full spectrum of functional outcomes and focuses on both limitations in usual duties/activities and changes in lifestyle in six scale grades. Briefly grade [ADDRESS_685169] on activities for patients in grade 1, whereas a lower intensity of the activities is required for those in grade 2. Grade 3 accounts for inability to perform certain activities forcing patients to structurally modify these. Finally, grade 4 is reserved for those patients with severe functional limitations requiring assistance with activities of daily living (ADL).  [IP_ADDRESS] Cognition The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) will be conducted at Visit 1.  To allow accurate interpretation, highest educational level/attainment will be recorded during  data collection   4.1.3 Functional Status Two different assessments of lower extremity functional capacity will be conducted at each visit these are (A) the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and (B) the timed up and go test (TUG). The 6MWT is a standardised and widely used measure of functional status in individuals with chronic disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, congestive cardiac failure, peripheral vascular disease, and elderly. It has been previously used to assess response to interventions and predict morbidity and mortality. Participants will be given a shortened practice attempt (1-2 minutes) at the beginning of each of their assessment visits. This will not be recorded but will be performed to allow familiarisation with the assessment and repeated at each visit for 
 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 15 consistency. Patients suffering from excessive fatigue/Post exertional malaise from the 6MWT will be excluded from the study to prevent further onset of these symptoms.   The TUG is reliable and reproducible and has been validated as a predictor of frailty and risk of falls in elderly adults. The TUG has several advantages over other measures, mainly its reproducibility and shorter assessment time. Its use at predicting functional status following pneumonia has not been assessed previously.  Participants will also be asked to self-report their return to functional activity and employment at each contact [CONTACT_52795] (telephone consultations and follow-up visits.) Each participant will be asked at each contact [CONTACT_527761] [ADDRESS_685170] returned to their occupation (if employed.) The patient-reported date of return to these activities will also be recorded.  4.1.4 Lung Function (Session 1) Full lung function tests including FEV1, FVC, PEFR, flow-volume curves, MIP, and MEP will be conducted during first visit. These spi[INVESTIGATOR_527728] a suitably qualified individual, proficient in the use of the specific equipment and according to published standards.  4.1.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Blood Pressure (Session 2 and 3) Participants will then be fitted with: a 12-channel electrocardiography (ECG) device (Custo Cardio 200, Customed, Ottobrunn, [LOCATION_013]); a blood pressure cuff positioned over the brachial artery (Tango M2, SunTech, Eynsham, [LOCATION_006]). Measurements will be taken following [ADDRESS_685171] (CPET) (Session 2 and 3) Cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be performed to measure VO2 peak and other parameters representative of cardiovascular reserve (McGregor et al., 2016). Tests will be conducted using a standard bicycle ramp protocol in accordance with American Thoracic Society guideline (Ross et al., 2003). In accordance with pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], we will stratify individuals starting load based on their 6MWT distance, Strata I: 6MWD < 350 (starting load of 10 watts; with subsequent increments of 5 watts), Strata II: 6MWD 350 – 400 (starting load of 20w with subsequent increments of 5w and Strata III: 6MWD > 400 (starting load of 30w with subsequent increments of 5W)  Participants will then complete a maximal graded exercise test on a friction-loaded cycle ergometer (Monark 894E Ergomedic Peak Bike, Monark, Varberg, Sweden). The cycle ergometer friction wheel will be calibrated according to manufacturer recommendations prior to the study. The cycle ergometer will be set up according to each participant’s body size and personal preference. The knee angle at the bottom of the pedal stroke will be ~25°, which is optimal for movement economy and injury prevention. Knee angle will be measured using a universal goniometer. The cycle ergometer handlebars will be positioned so that the participant can comfortably maintain an upright posture. The cycle ergometer set-up will be identical for each visit.   
 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences Long COVID Work Package [ADDRESS_685172] will be performed at a cadence of 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) (±10%). The exercise protocol will begin with a 3-minute rest period, followed by a step-wise incremental protocol, designed to achieve volitional exhaustion within 8-12 minutes of exercise onset. The exercise protocol will be individualised based on participants’ predicted exercise capacity, as described above. Heart rate and pulmonary gas exchange data will be measured continuously. Blood pressure and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (6 to 20 scale) will be measured during the final [ADDRESS_685173] their forearm is rested on the researcher’s shoulder (padded with a folded towel). This will ensure that the participant’s arm is positioned near heart level to reduce measurement error. At the end of the exercise test, participants will complete a cooldown consisting of unloaded pedalling at 20rpm for 5-10 minutes. All data will be exported for offline analysis using Microsoft Excel (Washington, [LOCATION_003]).   Criteria for the assessment of a good participant effort will include peak respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] (RER) >1.10, peak HR≥85% predicted and RPE ≥18.31 (Balady et al., 2010). Prior to the test, participants will be monitored for [ADDRESS_685174] and 10 minutes seated recovery. Blood Pressure monitoring continuously (every 30s). Blood lactate concentration will be monitored through fingertip sampling at the end of each stage and at 5-minute intervals for 30 minutes following volitional fatigue.    [IP_ADDRESS] Pulmonary Gas Exchange Measures Breath-by-breath pulmonary gas exchange data will be smoothed using a middle five of seven breath average. Key variables of interest include: the first ventilatory threshold (VT1), the respi[INVESTIGATOR_527729] (RCP), peak oxygen consumption (V̇O2peak) and end-tidal CO2. V̇O2peak is defined as the mean V̇O2 over the last [ADDRESS_685175], adjusted for body mass (ml·kg−1·min−1). VT1 will be determined by [CONTACT_10540] V-slope method to identify the deflection point in the relationship between V̇CO2  and V̇O2 – indicating a disproportionate rise in CO2 production due to increasing anaerobic glycolytic activity (65). VT1 will be confirmed using the nadir of the ventilatory equivalent (VE) for V̇O2 (VE/V̇O2) (65). The RCP will be determined using the V-slope method to identify the deflection point in the relationship between VE and V̇CO2 – which marks the onset of hyperventilation caused by [CONTACT_527762] (65). The RCP will be confirmed using the nadir of VE/V̇CO2  (65). The VT1 and the RCP will be confirmed by [CONTACT_527763]. Where agreement is not reached, a third researcher will adjudicate. End-tidal CO2 is the partial pressure of CO2 measured at the end of each breath.

The reported mortality rate ranges from 0 to 1 death per 10,000 tests, and the non-fatal adverse event rate ranges from 0 to 5.2 per 10,000 tests.  4.4 Risk Management  4.4.1 Cardiovascular Risk Participation in aerobic exercise may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as cardiac ischaemia, arrythmia or hypotension. The use of an appropriate graduated warm-up and cool-down is recommended to minimise these risks (ACSM, 2021). In the proposed study, participants’ physiological response to exercise will be closely monitored during and after exercise. Exercise will be stopped if any adverse signs or symptoms occur (see table above). The researcher is experienced in the provision of clinical exercise tests and is trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.   4.4.[ADDRESS_685178] exertional malaise has been identified in patients with long covid especially with incremental exercise and exertion.

An AE includes: • Exacerbation of pre-existing illness • Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756] • Condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention even though it may have been present before the start of the study • Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsens following the start of the study  
 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 19 An AE does not include: • Medical or surgical procedure (e.g. surgery, tooth extraction) but the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE • Pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that did not worsen • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has occurred (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_439887]) • Disease or disorder being studied, or sign or symptom associated with the disease or disorder unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition • Overdose of concurrent medication without any signs or symptoms  4.7.2 Non-serious AEs All such events, whether expected or not, should be recorded.  4.7.3 Abnormal Baseline Findings Abnormal findings at that are deemed to be a clinically significant abnormality may be reported as an AE, according to the judgement of the Chief Investigator taking into account any associated clinical symptoms/signs from the below measures during pre; mid and post time frame.  4.7.4 Reporting Procedures for All AEs Aim: to describe adverse events relating to study and the reporting process  Adverse event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) will use the local NHS Trust reporting procedures but reported to the University of Derby [CONTACT_527765].  All AEs should be reported on the CRF. Any questions concerning adverse event reporting should be directed to the Chief Investigator in the first instance. Participants will be asked to report AE’s and SAE’s during all follow up sessions. All participants will be provided with contact [CONTACT_4664] a trial phone, where they can communicate AE/SAE throughout the study and will be operated during working hours (Monday to Friday 9-5). Outside of these working hours, participants are encouraged to leave a voicemail and the study team will contact [CONTACT_527766].  The following information will be recorded: description, date of onset and end date and severity. Follow-up information should be provided, as necessary. AEs considered related to the study as judged by a medically qualified investigator (Tom Bewick, CI) or the sponsor will be followed until resolution or the event is considered stable. All related AEs that result in a participant’s withdrawal from the study or are present at the end of the study, should be followed up until a satisfactory resolution occurs. It will be to the responsibility of the Chief Investigator’s clinical judgement whether an AE is of sufficient severity to warrant removal from the study. The relationship of AEs to the study will be assessed by a medically qualified investigator. All such events, whether expected or not will be recorded.  
 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 20 4.7.5 Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Any untoward and unexpected medical occurrence or effect that: • Results in death • Is life-threatening – refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe • Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or prolongation of existing inpatients’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  An SAE form will be completed and forwarded to the sponsor or delegated representative within 24 hours. However, relapse and death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527730] a pre-existing condition do not need reporting as SAEs. All SAEs should be reported to the study sponsor local Research Ethics Committee where in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_527731], the event was: • ‘Related’, i.e. resulted from the administration of any of the research procedures; and • ‘Unexpected’, i.e. an event that is not listed in the protocol as an expected occurrence  4.7.6 Reporting Procedures for All SAEs Reports of related and unexpected SAEs should be submitted within 15 days of the Chief Investigator becoming aware of the event, using the ‘COREC SAE’ form for non-CTIMP studies. Local investigators should report any SAEs as required by [CONTACT_527767]/or Research & Development Office. Fatal or life-threatening SAEs must be reported within [ADDRESS_685181] be sent to R&I using one of the following methods:  i. Email: [EMAIL_10073] ii.

Telephone: [ZIP_CODE] 59 7815 (If written report not immediately possible)  The intensity of the AE will initially be assessed according to the following definitions: • Mild: An event easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with everyday activities • Moderate: An event sufficiently discomforting to interfere with everyday activities • Severe: An event that prevents everyday activities  All AE and SAE Reporting documentation (i.e. NHS National Patient Safety Agency, National Research Ethics Service, Report of Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event) physical copi[INVESTIGATOR_527732].  
 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences Long COVID Work Package [ADDRESS_685182]’s core principles. This includes a trial independent monitor which will carry out the monitoring of the study data as an on-going activity.  Staff involved in the study will ensure that all participants’ confidentiality is maintained. The participants will be identified only by [CONTACT_527768] (for purposes of address on the telephone), and a unique patient study identification number on the CRF and central electronic database. All documents will be stored securely and only accessible by [CONTACT_527769]. The study will comply with the Data Protection Act (in the [LOCATION_006]) and with local legal requirements alongside the principles of ICH-GCP (worldwide); in line with this, all data will be anonymised as soon as it is practical to do so. The fully anonymised study data will be stored for at least five years following the closure of the study and thereafter disposed of in line with regulatory requirements. No participant will be individually identified in any subsequent publications relating to this study.  The study database will be kept on Microsoft Excel© [ADDRESS_685183] access to participants’ data. The Chief Investigator and/or Principal Investigators will facilitate access to study records for monitoring, audits, and regulatory inspections.  6.0 Data Retention and Archiving In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, regulations and following the University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527733]. These will be retained for at least 15 years (or for longer if required). If the Chief Investigator is no longer able to maintain the data records, an alternative person will be nominated to take over this responsibility.  The Trial Master File and Trial documents held by [CONTACT_527770]. This archive shall include all study databases and associated meta-data encryption codes.  
 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences Long COVID Work Package 2 Protocol Version 1 15-03-2021 22 6.1 Amendments Amendments to the study protocol will be handled according to the Health Research Authority’s guidelines for Non-CTIMP studies. Decisions to amend the protocol will be the responsibility of the Sponsor in consultation with the Chief Investigator and Principal Investigator. The Sponsor will have responsibility for determining the category of each amendment (Substantial versus Non-Substantial). All substantial and non-substantial amendments will be reported directly to the local Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527734]. It will be authorised by [CONTACT_527771]. The appropriate documentation, clearly detailing changes, will be emailed to the responsible REC for review. Should a protocol amendment be made that requires REC approval, the changes in the protocol will not be instituted until the amendment and revised participant consent forms and participant information sheets (if appropriate) have been reviewed and received approval from the REC and R&I departments. A protocol amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to participants may be implemented immediately providing that the MHRA, R&I and REC are notified as soon as possible, and approval is requested. Minor protocol amendments only for logistical or administrative changes may be implemented immediately and therefore the REC will be informed.  6.2 Access to the Final Study Dataset The study database will be kept on Microsoft Excel© [ADDRESS_685184] access to participants’ data. The Chief Investigator and/or Principal Investigators will facilitate access to study records for monitoring, audits, and regulatory inspections.  7.0 Financing and Insurance This study is funded by [CONTACT_527772]: COVID-19 RFP Program to the value of £174,885.46.

Participants may be withdrawn from the study either at their request or at the discretion of the Chief Investigator. Participants will be made aware (via The Participant Information Sheet and Participant Consent Form) that withdrawing the data which has been collected cannot be erased and may still be used in the final data analysis and study dissemination (i.e. published journal). The Chief Investigator may withdraw a participant from the study at any time if they consider that the participant’s health is compromised by [CONTACT_527774]. The reasons for any participant withdrawal will be recorded on the study completion form of the CRF. The data collected from withdrawn participants will be included in the study report.  Besides, the Chief Investigator may discontinue a participant from the study at any time if they consider it necessary for any reason including but not limited to: • Ineligibility (arising during study or retrospective having been overlooked at screening) • Significant protocol deviation • Significant non-compliance with study requirements • An AE which results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures • Progression of illness that renders participants unable to comply with study procedures. • Consent is withdrawn • Lost to follow up  The reason for withdrawal will be clearly stated and recorded in the CRF.  If the participant is withdrawn due to an AE, the Chief Investigator will arrange for a follow-up telephone call until the AE has resolved or stabilised.

 2. SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title: Long-Term Safety Extension Study of ACTIMMUNE® (interferon γ- 1b) in Children and Young 
Adults with Friedreich’s Ataxia  
Protocol Number:  HZNP-ACT-303 Phase: [ADDRESS_937242] Drug:  ACTIMMUNE (interferon γ-1b) Indication: Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA)  
Number and Country of Study Sites:  Approximately 4 study centers in the U nited States.  
Objective:  
Evaluate the long-term safety of ACTIMMUNE in subj ects with FA . 
Study Design:  
This is a multi-center, open-label, long-term safety  extension study of ACTIMMUNE in the treatment of FA in 
children and young adults. Subjects who complete [ADDRESS_937243]-302 (Multicenter, Safety and Efficacy, Open -Label Extension Study of ACTIMMUNE® (interferon γ -1b) in 
Children and Y oung Adults with Friedreich’s Ataxia)  will be eligible to enter this long -term safety extension protocol.  
The Day 1 Visit of this study ( HZNP-ACT-303) occurs on the same day as the Week [ADDRESS_937244]-302.  
The treatment duration is open -ended, and treatment will continue until ACTIMMUNE is commercially available for 
the treatment of FA in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) or until the Sponsor decides not  to continue development for the 
treatment of FA . The initial dose  of ACTIMMUNE will be individualized for each subject and will be determined by 
[CONTACT_093], provided that the initial dose does not exceed the maximum tolerated dose in HZNP-ACT-302. The 
investigator may subsequently adjust the dose for any subject i f deemed clinically appropriate, provided that the dose 
does not exceed 100 µg/m2. Dose adjustments, including the reason for the change, will be recorded on the appropriate 
electronic case report form. All doses of ACTIMMUNE  will be administered by [CONTACT_690804] a 
week (TIW) at home. 
Subjects will be required to return for clinic visits at least every six months. At each 6-month assessment clinic visit, 
subjects will be dispensed  a 3-month supply of study drug, and an additional 3 -month supply will be directly shipped 
to the subjects’ home in between the required 6 -month clinic visits. Subjects who are not able to receive study drug 
shipments at their home will return to the clinic for interim clinic visits thre e months after the Baseline and 6 -month 
assessment visits  to obtain study drug; however, assessments (other than enquiries regarding adverse event s and 
concomitant medications ) will only be performed every six months.  Subjects who are able to receive direct- to-home 
shipments will be contact[CONTACT_690805] [ADDRESS_937245] visit, 
concomitant medication use, and undergo brief physical examinations (including vital sign monitoring ) and blood 
sample collection for routine clinical laboratory safety tests. If applicable, urine samples will be collected for 
pregnancy testi ng.  
At the time ACTIMMUNE becomes commercially available  or if development is ceased  for the treatment of FA , 
subjects who are active on study will return to the clinic while still on study drug and undergo electrocardiogram 
(ECG) and Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) assessments in addition to the above 6- month safety assessments 
at an End -of-Study (EOS) Visit prior to transition ing to the commercial product  or discontinuing study drug . Subjects 
who prematurely withdraw from the study will have EOS assessments completed within two weeks of study drug 
discontinuation.  
Details of study activities are provided in Section 2.1, Schedule of Assessments . 
Subject Population:  
Male and non -pregnant female subjects who completed [ADDRESS_937246]-302 will be eligible for enrollment.

6. INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Scientific Background  
ACTIMMUNE (interferon [IFN]-γ 1b) is an orphan drug product currently approved and 
indicated for reducing the frequency and severity of serious infections associated with chronic 

Horizon Pharma  Ireland Ltd.   ACTIMMUNE IND: 123947

 granulomatous disease (CGD) and for delaying the time to disease progression in patient s with 
severe, malignant osteopetrosis (SMO) ; it is approved under Biologics License Application 
(BLA) 103836, and is now being studied by [CONTACT_690810]’s Ataxia 
(FA).  
FA is an autosomal recessive d isorder associated with progressive ataxia, cardiomyopathy, 
scoliosis, diabetes , and loss of vis ual and sensorineural hearing function at later stages of the 
disease [Harding, 1981; Lynch et al, 2002a ]. FA has a prevalence of about 1 in 50,000 persons in 
the US [Tsou et al, 2009] . Patients develop difficulty walking, loss of coordination, and 
dysarthria. Degeneration of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, their axons in the dorsal 
columns, and the dorsal spi[INVESTIGATOR_690792]. A few ot her nuclei (including the dentate of the cerebellum) within the central 
nervous system are affected and contribute to the ataxia [ Simon et al, 2004] . The abnormal ge ne 
in FA and its product (frataxin) provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms in this disease. In 98% of individuals, FA is  caused by [CONTACT_690811] – adenine – 
adenine (GAA) repeats in the frataxin  gene (FXN). This triplet repeat is located within an intron, 
leading to decreased ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcription and levels of the mitochondrial 
frataxin protein. Decreased frataxin expression is implicated in the assembly and repair of mitochondrial iron-sulfur- cluster containing enz ymes and the ability to produce adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) [ Babcock et al, 1997; Koeppen, 2011; Rotig et al, 1997] . Frataxin deficiency 
leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation. This may initiate or propa gate free radical reactions 
leading to cell death, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction as a pathophysiological mechanism in FA.  
Patients with FA have frataxin protein levels in peripheral t issues that range from 2 -30% of 
control levels. The level of  frataxin protein correlates with age of onset and inversely with the 
length of the GAA repeat. In carriers, who do not develop symptoms of FA, frataxin protein 
levels range from 30 -80% of control levels [ Deutsch et al, 2010] . The lack of symptoms 
observed in carriers suggests that restoration of frataxin levels in patients  to those observed in 
carriers may lead to subst antial improvement of symptoms.  
At present, no therapy is  approved for use in FA  [Corben et al, 2014; Delatycki et al, 2014] . 
Many of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_690793], either by [CONTACT_690812] [ Arpa et al, 2014; Lynch et al, 2010; 
Lynch et al, 2012] . Frataxin -depleted cells have an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress.  
Subtype-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has been successful in vitro  at 
increasing levels of transcription of frataxin, and is beginning early stage trials in humans [ Rai et 
al, 2008; Sandi et al, 2011] . Erythropoietin and its derivatives raise frataxin levels in peripheral 
tissues by [CONTACT_105]- transcriptional means, but the effect has been too small to observe efficacy in 
human trials  [Boesch et al, 2014; Mariotti et al, 2012 ]. 
IFN-γ, a protein produced by [CONTACT_690813], increases both 
frataxin messenger RNA ( mRNA) and protein levels in a variety of different cell types, including 
cell lines derived from FA patients. In addition, an FA mouse model treated with subcutaneous 
(SC) injections of IFN- γ for [ADDRESS_937267]

 that was mirrored by [CONTACT_690814]  
[Tomassini et al, 2012] . Its mechanism of action is as a transcr iptional activator of multiple 
genes. From a therapeutic perspective, ACTIMMUNE is approved for use in the US in patients  
with CGD and SMO ( see prescribing information  in Section 16.2), and has been investigated in 
other conditions, including oncology, infectious diseases , and inflammatory disorders.  
6.2 Rationale for the Study  
In an Investigator -Initiated Study (IIS) in FA conducted by , 12 subjects between 
the ages of 5 and 17 years (mean age of 12 years) with genetically- confirmed FA were treated 
with ACTIMMUNE by [CONTACT_690815] (TIW) over the course of a 12- week 
treatment period. The starting dose was 10 µg/m2 for the first two weeks of the study, then 
escalated to 25 µg/m2 for weeks three and four, and then escalated to 50 µg/m2 for the final eight 
weeks of treatment. All subjects followed the same dose- escalation schedule, with adjustments 
made in the event of clinical ly significant adverse events. Ten of the subjects completed 12 
weeks of treatment, with the remaining two subjects discontinuing prior to 8 weeks of treatment 
due to transportation issues. 
As reported by [CONTACT_89588], ACTIMMUNE  was well -tolerated with no S AEs, with only two 
subjects reporting severe dose-related adverse events and subsequent dose reductions. Efficacy 
results showed small changes in frataxin levels observed in red blood cells, peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) , and platelets after 12 weeks of treatment ; however, the results 
varied between tissues.  Frataxin tissue samples were not timed to drug administration, potentially 
contributing to the variability of the results  [Seyer et al, 2014] . 
The mean improvement in FARS score was significant after 12 weeks of treatment (p = 0.008). 
The magnitude of improvement in FARS score when contrasted with the natural history of FA deterioration wa s equivalent to almost [ADDRESS_937268] salvage and absolute disease improvement. No statistically  significant 
relationships were observed between frataxin protein levels, FARS scores, and in vivo IFN- γ 
levels [Seyer et al, 2014] . On withdrawal of ACTIMMUNE during the follow-up period , there 
was a trend for the FARS scores to worsen , suggesting a loss of therapy- related benefit.  
Other secondary endpoints included  timed performance tests , such as the timed 25 -foot walk 
(T25FW), fai led to show any significant treatment -related changes, but this may reflect the small 
sample size in this IIS. 
Overall, the safety profile  of ACTIMMUNE  in FA subjects in this IIS  mirrors the typi[INVESTIGATOR_690794]. In two cases, the maintenance dose of ACTIMMUNE was lower than planned in response to either raised liver function tests and/or flu-like symptoms. Subjects were able to continue in the study following dose reduction. 
Based on the results of the IIS, Horizon is currently conducting two studies with ACTIMMUNE. 
The first study (HZNP -ACT-301) is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled

 26-week study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ACTIMMUNE administered to  children and 
young adults with FA, and the second study (HZNP -ACT-302) is an open- label 26-week efficacy 
and safety extension of HZNP-ACT-301, in which all subjects who complete blinded treatment 
in HZNP-ACT-[ADDRESS_937269]-302 the opportunity to continue receiving 
ACTIMMUNE until it is commercially available for the treatment of FA in the US or until the 
Sponsor decides to discontinue development for this indication. 
FA is a rare, debilitating, autosomal recessive deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA)-inherited, 
mitochondrial disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. The rationale for 
use of ACTIMMUNE  for the treatment of FA is based on in vitro and animal data, and clinical 
experience in FA subject s. Currently, t here is no FDA-approved therapy for FA. ACTIMMUNE 
was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of FA on October 1, 2014.

7.[ADDRESS_937270]-302 (Multicenter, Safety and Efficacy, Open -Label 
Extension Study of ACTIMMUNE® [interferon γ-1b] in Children and Young Adults with 
Friedreich’s Ataxia) will be eligible to enter this long -term safety extension protocol. The Day 1 
Visit of this study ( HZNP-ACT-303) occurs on the same day as the Week [ADDRESS_937271] if deemed clinically appropriate, provided that the dose does not exceed 100 µg/m
2. Dose adjustments, including the reason for the change, will 
be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).  All doses of ACTIMMUNE 
will be administered by [CONTACT_690804] a week (TIW) at home.

assessment  clinic visit, subjects will be dispensed a 3 -month supply of study drug, and an 
additional 3-month supply will be directly shipped to the subjects’ home in between the required 
6-month clinic visits.  Subjects who are not able to receive study drug shipments at their home 
will return to the clinic for interim clinic visits three months after the Baseline and 6 -month 
assessment visits to obtain study drug; however, assessments (other than queries regarding adverse events and concomitant medications) will only be performed every six months. Subjects who are able to receive direct -to-home shipments will be contacte d by [CONTACT_690816] 3-month 
interim visits and queried regarding adverse events and concomitant medication use.
 
At each [ADDRESS_937273] visit , concomitant medication  use, and undergo brief physical 
examinations (including vital sign monitoring ) and blood sample collection for routine clinical 
laboratory safety tests. If applicable, urine samples will be collected for pregnancy testing.  
At the time  ACTIMMUNE becomes commercially available or if development is ceased for the 
treatment of FA , subjects will return to the clinic while still on active study drug and undergo 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) assessments in addition to the above 6 -month safety assessments at an End -of-Study (EOS) Visit prior to transition ing to 
the commercial product  or discontinuing study drug. Subjects who prematurely withdraw from 
the study will have EOS assessments completed within two weeks of study drug discontinuation.

the eCRF using one of the following categories: 
• Adverse event. The subject experiences  an adverse event that imposes an unacceptable 
risk to the subject’s health, or the subject is unwilling to continue because of an  adverse 
event. 
• Lack of therapeutic effect. The investigator has determined that study drug administration 
is not benefitting the subject , and continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to 
the subject.  
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria violation.  The investigator discovers that the subject did not 
meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria after study enrollment. 
• Lost to follow-up. The subject does not return to the clinic for scheduled assessments, 
and does not respond to the site’s attempts to contact [CONTACT_423]. 
• Voluntary withdrawal. The subject (or subject’s legally acceptable representative) wishes to withdraw from the study. The clinical site should attempt to determine the underlying 
reason for the voluntary withdrawal and document it on the eCRF; if the under lying 
reason is documented as an adverse event or lack of efficacy, the category of withdrawal should be marked in the corresponding category and not as voluntary withdrawal. 
• Study termination. The Sponsor, IRB, or regulatory agency terminates the study. 
• Pregnancy.  
Following premature withdrawal from the study, the subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative will be contact[CONTACT_690817].

 8.4 Treatments  
8.4.1 Treatments Administered  
All subjects will receive ACTIMMUNE. The planned treatment duration is open- ended, and 
treatment will continue until ACTIMMUNE is commercially available for the treatment of FA in 
the US or until the Sponsor discontinues development for this indication. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Adjustment Guidelines  
Subjects will receive SC doses of ACTIMMUNE TIW  at home. The initial dose of 
ACTIMMUNE will be determined by [CONTACT_239403], provided that the initial 
dose does not exceed the maximum tolerated dose in HZNP- ACT-302. The investigator may 
subsequently adjust the dose for any subject if deemed clinically appropriate, provided that the 
dose does not exceed 100 µg/m2.  
8.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products 
[IP_ADDRESS] ACTIMMUNE  
ACTIMMUNE is a single -chain polypeptide containing 140 amino acids with a molecular 
weight of approximately 16,465 Daltons. ACTIMMUNE  differs from natural human IFN -γ by 
[CONTACT_690818] N-terminal methionine, deletion/loss of seven amino acids and 
lack of glycosylation. 
The commercial formulation of ACTIMMUNE is a sterile, clear, colorless solution filled in a 
single-use vial for SC injection. Each 0.5 mL of ACTIMMUNE contains: 100 µg (2 million 
international units [ IU]) of IFN-γ 1b formulated in 20 mg mannitol, 0.37 mg disodium succinate 
hexahydrate, 0.14 mg succinic acid, 0.05 mg polysorbate 20, and sterile water for injection. 
The Sponsor will provide unlabeled, commercial ACTIMMUNE to CSM. The commercial 
formulation will be utilized, with each unlabeled vial containing ACTIMMUNE in a concentration of 200 µg/mL. Each vial permits the extraction of up to 0.5 mL of ACTIMMUNE with additional volume to facilitate solution withdrawal. The study drug vials will be shipped to CSM, who will be re sponsible for labeling of the vials in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
(see Section 8.4.3) and assembling vials into kits . If a subject requires two vials per dose, the 
same volume should be removed from each vial and delivered in individual syringes. For example, if the dose should be 0.[ADDRESS_937278] shipments.  
Labels on all vials of study drug and study drug kits will clearly indicate the study number, Sponsor’s name [CONTACT_225458], storage conditions, and appropriate precautionary labeling required

Date: 05 April 2016   Protocol: HZNP -ACT-[ADDRESS_937279]/caregiver. 
8.4.4 Storage 
Study drug kits  are to be stored in a 2°C to 8°C (36 °F to 46°F) refrigerator  at the site, and 
subjects and their caregivers will be instructed to store all study drug in their home refrigerators.  
At the clinic, a ll study medications must be stored in a secure area with limited access , and a 
daily temperature log of the drug storage area will be maintained every working day; significant 
deviations from the specified temperature range will be reported as protocol deviations. 
Vials must be placed in a 2°C to 8°C (36 °F to 46°F) refrigerator immediately upon receipt to 
ensure optimal retention of physical and biochemical integrity. The vials must not be frozen. 
Excessive or vigorous agitation should be avoided. Exposure of vials to temperatures greater 
than 25°C (77 °F) should be strictly avoided. The sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_690819] (>8 °C) for a total time exceeding [ADDRESS_937280]/care giver, the clinic is to be notified 
immediately  for instructions regarding dosing and possible re-supply. The clinic will notify the 
Sponsor and Med Communications, Inc. of any product complaints. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_937281] be retained by [CONTACT_690820], until drug accountability has been completed. Periodically throughout the study and at the conclusion of the study, inventory checks and accountability of study materials will be conducted by [CONTACT_57756]’s representative. Once accountability is completed, the Sponsor or it’s representative will authorize the return of study medication (all 
used, partially used, and unused vials) to CSM . The completed Drug Accountability and Drug 
Return/Destruction Record(s) will be returned to the Sponsor. The investigator’s copy of the Drug Accountability and Drug Return/Destruction Record(s) must document accurately the 
return of all study drug supplies. Records will also include disposition dates and quantities returned to the designated facility.

Date: 05 April 2016   Protocol: HZNP -ACT-[ADDRESS_937282] containers supplied by [CONTACT_690821]-up visit(s). Study 
staff will dispose of these containers appropriately. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_937283]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Description of Clinical Supplies  
CSM will supply study drug kits and packages containing ancillary supplies for dosing 
(i.e., syringes, alcohol swabs, gauze pads, bandages, and biohazard containers for safe storage of 
used needles and syringes) to the study sites  as well as the direct -to-subject shipments. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Determination of Dose Volume  
The volume of study drug to be administered will be determined by [CONTACT_690822]’s body surface area ( BSA). The BSA will be calculated using the Mosteller 
[Mosteller, 1987 ] formula: 
𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵  (𝑚𝑚2)=  �𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑡𝑡 (𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖)∗𝑊𝑊𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑡𝑡 (𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙)
3131 
Given that each 0.5 mL of study drug solution contains 100 µg I FN-γ 1b (0.005 mL/µg), the 
following calculation will be used to determine the volume of study drug to be administered.  
Dose (µg/m2)  × BSA  × 0.005 mL/µg = ___ mL to be dosed 
For example, a subject who is [ADDRESS_937284] a BSA of 1.41 m2. 
If the dose is 100 µg/m2, the subject will receive 0.71 mL of study drug. 
100 µg/m2 × 1.41 m2 × 0.005 mL/µg = 0.705 mL, rounded to 0.71 mL of study drug 
[IP_ADDRESS] Details Concerning Timing and Dose Administration 
All doses of study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_10530] . Subjects and/or their caregivers 
will be instructed on their individualized dosing volume and proper dosing techniques ; they will 
also be instructed to administer the study drug on the right and left deltoid , anterior thigh, and 
upper and lower abdomen and to rotate the injection sites .  
Subjects or their caregivers will also be instructed in safe handling and storage of used syringes 
and needles. The clinical staff will demonstrate proper technique for withdrawing the appropriate volume of study drug from the vial. If two vials are needed  to achieve the dose, an equal volume 
should be removed from each vial. For example, if the dose should be 0.[ADDRESS_937285] into the pi[INVESTIGATOR_690795], and the entire volume of study drug will be injected under the skin.

 Subjects and their caregivers will be instructed to administer study drug on an outpatient basis 
TIW (e.g., a dosing schedule of Monday, Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and 
Saturday) for the duration  of the study.  
At each clinic visit , subjects and/or their caregivers will be dispensed a 3-month supply of study 
drug, and an additional 3-month supply will be directly shipped to the subjects’ home in between the required 6- month clinic visits . If direct shipments are not feasible, subjects will return to the 
clinic every three months to obtain study drug. A t all post-Baseline clinic visits, subjects and/or 
their caregivers will return all unused kits and study drug  vials.

An inventory of the study medication supplies will be performed by [CONTACT_690825]’s source document 
records or equivalent. 
8.5 Efficacy and Safety Variables 
The Schedule of Assessments was previously provided in Section 2.1. 
8.5.1 Efficacy Variables  
Efficacy will be assessed using the Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) (total score 
[FARStot] and score excluding the peripheral nervous system subscale score and  the facial and 
tongue atrophy and fasciculations from the bulbar subscale score [ FARS-mNeuro score]).

Date: 05 April 2016   Protocol: HZNP -ACT-303 
  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 23 of 57 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) 
The FARS will be performed at the EOS (or PW) Visit. The FARS includes neurological signs 
that specifically reflect neural substrates affected in FA. Based on a neurological examination , 
bulbar, upper limb, lower limb, peripheral nerve, and upright stability/gait functions are assessed 
[Friedman et al, 2010; Lynch et al, 2006; Subramony et al, 2005] . 
The FARStot score has a maximum of 125 points (see assessment in Section 16.3), and the 
FARS-mNeuro score has a maximum of 93 points. 
8.5.2 Safety Variables 
Safety assessments will include adverse event monitoring , concomitant medication monitoring, 
physical examinations, vi tal signs, ECGs, clinical safety laboratory evaluations (complete blood 
count, chemistry, and urinalysis), and pregnancy testing (if applicable). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
Comprehensive assessments of any apparent adverse event experienced by [CONTACT_690826]. Study center personnel will record all adverse 
events, whether observed by [CONTACT_737]/designee or reported by [CONTACT_423] /caregiver , in the 
source document and on the e CRF. A physician (the Principal Investi gator or a physician/nurse 
practitioner/physician’s assistant designated by [CONTACT_079]) will manage and treat 
any treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE). 
Adverse event information will be elicited from each subject/caregiver  by [CONTACT_690827] a non-leading question, such as “Has anything bothered you since your last visit or is anything bothering you now?” Adverse event data also may be volunteered by [CONTACT_7071]/caregiver  to the Investigator (or designee). A physician (either the Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] 
[INVESTIGATOR_1660] a physician /nurse practitioner/physician’s assistant designated by [CONTACT_079]) 
will assess the seriousness, severity, and causality of each adverse event based on the following 
definitions and documentation requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Definitions  
Adverse Event : As defined by [CONTACT_11580], an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in 
a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an investigational product, whether or not 
the event is considered related to the investigational product. An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the investigational product.  
NOTE: The term “adverse event” includes both non-serious and serious adverse events unless 
otherwise specified  
A TEAE is any a dverse change from the subject’s baseline condition, including any laboratory 
test value abnormality  judged as clinically significant b y the investigator, that occurs on or after 
the date of the first dose of study drug administered at home and throughout the duration of the 
Horizon Pharma  Ireland Ltd.   ACTIMMUNE IND: 123947

  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 24 of 57 
 clinical study, whether the adverse event is considered related to the treatment or not. Adverse 
events include the following types of occurrences: 
• Adverse reaction: an adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse events for which there is reason to 
conclude that the drug caused the event. 
• Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event . Reasonable possibility means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event . A 
suspected  adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than 
adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Suspected adverse 
reactions are the subset of all adverse event s for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the event.  
• Other medical experiences, regardless of their relationship to the study drug, such as 
injury, accidents, increased severity of pre-existing symptoms, apparently unrelated 
illness, and clinically significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory values, physiological testing, or physical examination findings.  
• Reactions from drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, an interaction with another 
drug or substance, or toxicity.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An adverse event is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death. This includes any death that occurs during the conduct of a clinical study, 
including deaths that appear to be completely unrelated to the study drug ( e.g., car 
accidents).  
• Life-threatening adverse experience.  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, i ts 
occurrence places the subject  at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324].  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Other medically important event which, according to appropriate medical judgment, may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

  Version 1.0 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA  IRELAND LTD  Page 25 of 57 
 Of note: Surgical procedures or other therapeutic interventions themselves are not adverse 
events, but the condition for which the surgery/intervention is required is an adverse event and should be documented accordingly.  
Elective surgeries and/or treatments requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( e.g., cosmetic surgery), and 
treatment received at an emergency room or similar facility, will not be considered as SAEs 
unless one of the definitions of an SAE listed above is met. 
Non-Serious Adverse Event: A non-serious adverse event includes any adverse event  that is not 
described in the previous SAE category. 
Unexpected:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpec ted if it is not 
listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not listed with  the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. Unexpected, as used in this definition, also refers to adverse event s or suspected 
adverse reactions that  are mentioned in the Investigator B rochure as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_937288]-302 will be considered baseline 
signs/symptoms. The TEAE reporting period begins with the date of the first dose of study drug 
in Study HZNP- ACT-303 and continues until completion of study participation (i.e., the patient 
is transitioned to the commercially available product, the Sponsor decides not to continue development for the treatment of FA, or the subject prematurely withdraws from the study). All baseline signs/symptoms and TEAE s must be recorded in the source documents and on the 
subject’s eCRF. 
If the Investigator observes an SAE after study co mpletion that he/she believes was possibly 
caused by [CONTACT_7860], the Investigator will report this SAE using the procedures described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].5. 
Unchanged, chronic conditions are NOT  considered adverse event s and should not be recorded 
on the adverse event pages of the eCRF unless there is an exacerbation of a chronic condition.  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject ’s condition attributable to the 
disease for which the study drug is being studied ( i.e., FA). It may be an increase in the severity 
of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of worsening ataxia may  be considered as disease progression and not an  adverse event . Events, 
which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should only be reported as adverse event s if 
they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. 
In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_690796], and emergency room visits less than 24 hours in duration are 
not considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
Horizon Pharma  Ireland Ltd.   ACTIMMUNE IND: 123947  
Date: 05 April 2016   Protocol: HZNP -ACT-[ADDRESS_937289] also be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event 
Reporting Form. Whenever possible, the Investigator should group together into a single term the signs and symptoms that constitute a single diagnosis.  For example, cough, rhinitis, and 
sneezing might be grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]” if the Investigator is confident of the diagnosis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_937290] 
results, will be assessed in accordance with the following criteria:  
• Mild (Grade 1): awareness of signs or symptoms that are easily tolerated, are of minor 
irritant type,  cause no loss of time from usual activities, do not require medication or 
further medical evaluation, and/or are transient. 
• Moderate (Grade 2):  signs or symptoms sufficient to interfere with function but not 
activities of daily living.  
• Severe (Grade 3):  signs or symptoms sufficient to interfere with activities of daily living; 
signs and symptoms may be of a systemic nature or may require further medical evaluation and/or treatment. 
• Life-Threatening (Grade 4):  disabling or with life -threatening consequences. This 
definition does not include any event that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more severe form.  
• Fatal (Grade 5):  death related to an  adverse event . 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of the study drug to each adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_690828] : 
• No reasonable causal relationship (probably not related): There is no plausible temporal 
relationship or there is another explanation that unequivocally provides a more plausible 
explanation for the event. 
• Yes, reasonable causal relationship (possibly related): There is evidence in favor of a 
causal relationship; i.e., there is a plausible time course, and at least one of the following 
criteria apply:  
 There is a reasonable pharmacological  relationship (or known class effect) 
 There is no other more plausible explanation

  There is a positive de- challenge (without active treatment of the event)  
 There is a positive re- challenge  
 There is a distinguishable dose effect  
Within the reporting requirement under 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i), the FDA provides the following 
examples of types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongl y associated 
with drug exposure ( e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome). 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug ( e.g., tendon 
rupture). 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events 
that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_937291] be reported. The following steps will be taken to report promptly and document accurately any SAE, whether or not it appears to be related to the study medication: 
1) Report the SAE to Med Communications, Inc.  by [CONTACT_144530] [ADDRESS_937292]  has experienced an SAE (see Appendix 16.[ADDRESS_937293] information). 
2) Record the SAE accurately in the source documents and on the adverse event page of 
the subject’s  eCRF, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. Using the Serious Adverse 
Event Reporting Form, submit all known subject  information to Med 
Communications, Inc. (as specified in separate instructions provided to the study center) on the SAE reporting form within 24 hours of learning of the SAE 
occurrence.  
3) Perform appropriate diagnostic tests and therapeutic measures, and submit all follow-
up substantiating data, such as diagnostic test reports, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], and autopsy report to the Sponsor’s representative. 
4) Respond in a timely manner to any queries from Sponsor regarding the SAE.

 5) Conduct appropriate consultation and follow-up evaluation until the SAE is resolved, 
stabilized, or otherwise explained by [CONTACT_737]. 
6) Review each SAE report and evaluate the relationship of the SAE to st udy treatment.  
The Sponsor will determine whether the SAE is unexpected in nature. 
7) The Investigator must report all adverse event s or SAEs that meet the criteria for 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Human Subjects or Others to the IRB. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_937294].

The Investigator will ensure that the study is conducted in accor dance with all regulations 
governing the protection of human subjects. The Investigator will adhere to the basic principles of GCP as outlined in Title 21 of the CFR, Part 312, Subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”; 21 CFR, Part 50, “Protection of Human Subjects”; 21 CFR, Part 56, “Institutional Review Boards”; 21 CFR, Part 54 “Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_6230]”; and the ICH guideline entitled “Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance”. Additionally, this study will be conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with all local 
laws and regulations. 
The Investigator will ensure that all work and services described in or associated with this 
protocol are conducted in accordance with the investigational plan, applicable regulations, and the highest standards of medical and clinical research practice.  The Inves tigator will provide 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_690798]-Investigators, pharmacists, and other staff responsible for study conduct. 
All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_166813]. 
The Sponsor will ensure that the study is monitored adequately in accordance with GCP guidelines. 
Prior to initiation of the study, the Sponsor and /or it’s representatives will review with study 
center personnel information regarding the investigational drug, protocol requirements, 
monitoring requirements, and reporting of SAEs. 
At intervals during the study, as well as  after the completion of subject enrollment, the stud y 
center will be monitored by [CONTACT_690835].  During these visits, the monitor will 
discuss study progress, verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of the data being entered on the eCRF (sou rce data verification); oversee the resolution 
of outstanding data discrepancies, and check on various aspects of study conduct ( e.g., drug 
accountability, sample storage).  The Investigator agrees to allow these monitors access to the 
clinical sup plies, dispensing and storage areas, and clinical records of the study subjects, and, if 
requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The Investigator must cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visit s are resolved.  
A secondary audit may be conducted by [CONTACT_284462]. The Investigator will be informed if this is to take place and advised as to the nature of the audit. Representatives of the US FDA and/or representatives of  other regulatory authorities may also 
conduct an inspection of the study at the investigative site. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately.

Consent/Assent Form. 
12. DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data will be entered into a clinical database as specified in Premier Research’s Data 
Management Plan. Quality control and data validation procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent errors, and values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification will be communicated to the investigational site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections will be documented in an audit trail.  
The coding of an adverse event, medical history and concomitant medication terms will be performed by [CONTACT_690836]. Concomitant 
medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODrug) and adverse event/medical history/surgery/non drug therapy terms will be coded using the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
13. RETENTION OF RECORDS  
No study documents at the study site should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. All subjects ’ medical records, the Investigator’s copy 
of the eCRF, other supporting data, records of drug dispensing and accountability, signed Informed Consent Forms, IRB correspondence, and correspondence with the Sponsor must be kept by [CONTACT_690837] a 
marketing application in an ICH region (including the US) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in any other ICH region.  If an application is not filed or not 
approved for the indication unde r study, all study -related files  must be retained for at least  two 
years following the date of discontinuation of the clinical development program for ACTIMMUNE  and for a period in compliance with all federal, state and local regul ations. The 
Sponsor must be notified prior to the disposal of any study- related files.  If the Investigator leaves 
the practice or institution during the required retention period, it is important that arrangements be made for continued record retention. In that event, the records generally will be retained at the 
institution at which the study was conducted.

• Any prior history of documented cerebral infarct, TIA or systemic 
embolism [excluding a post- operative deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) ] 
≤180 days prior to enrollment 
• Active systemic infection  
• Pregnant, lactating (current or anticipated during study follow up), or 
women of childbearing potential who are, or plan to become, 
pregnant during the time of the study (method of assessment upon physician’s discretion) 
• Subjects who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that would directly int
erfere with the current study, except 
when the subject is participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry with no associated treatments; each instance must be brought to the attention of the sponsor to determine eligi bility  
• Subjects who in the judgment of the investigator have a life 
expectancy of less than two years  
 
*LVEF and LA diameters obtained ≤ 180 days prior to enrollment will be 
acceptable,  unless a cardiac event has occurred (e.g. MI) between the date of the 
exam and the enrollment date, otherwise a new echocardiogram (trans -thoracic or 
trans -esophageal, or intracardiac echo) must be performed to confirm eligibility 
prior to performing ablation . For TTE , LA anteroposterior diameter measured by 
M-mode from the parasternal long- axis view will be used.  If both LA diameter 
and volume are available, only one meeting eligibility criteria is required.  
 
**The absence of thrombus must  be confirmed by [CONTACT_3553] a trans -esophageal 
echocardiogram ( TEE) within  48 hours prior to the procedure or I ntracardiac 
Echography (I CE) during the procedure  in subjects  not adequately  anticoagulated 
(see section 12.5.2 .) for at least 3 weeks  prior to procedure  OR with CHA 2DS 2-VASc 
score (see Appendix 30.4) ≥2 in men  and ≥3 in women OR enlarged LA (≥4.5c m). 
If a thrombus is observed, the subject no longer meets eligibility criteria. When 
screening for thrombus prior to the index procedure, ensure that the 
anticoagulation approach as de scribed in section 12.5.2. is followed until the day 
of the procedure.  
Arrhythmia Monitoring Strategy  This study will employ a rhythm surveillance monitoring strategy

Statistical Methods  
Primary 
Statistical Hypothesis Hypothesis for primary safety endpoint  
• Ho:  The primary safety endpoint event-free rate at [ADDRESS_1182203] 
procedure ≤  89% 
• Ha:  The primary safety endpoint event-free rate at [ADDRESS_1182204] 
procedure > 89% 
 
Hypothesis for primary effectiveness endpoint  
• Ho:  The 12-month failure- free rate ≤50%  
• Ha:  The 12-month failure- free rate > 50%  
The performance goal of 50% is based on the minimum chronic acceptable 
success rate for paroxysmal AF at [ADDRESS_1182205] 
Method  Primary safety endpoint  
The 12 month (365- day) primary safety event -free rate will be calculated 
using Kaplan- Meier methodology. Subjects who withdraw from the 
study prior to 12 months without experiencing an event will be censored 
on the date of withdrawal.  The 95% one -sided lower confidence limit of

the observed safety event -free rate will be compared to the performance 
goal of 89%. If the lower confidence limit is greater than the performance 
goal, the null hypothesis will be rejected. The lower confidence limit will be calculated as the pointwise confidence limit using the log -log 
methodology. 
 
Primary effectiveness endpoint  
For the primary effectiveness endpoint, the Kaplan -Meier 12 month (365 -
day) primary effectiveness event -free rate will be calculated. Subjects 
who withdraw from the study prior to 12 months without experiencing an 
event will be censored on the date of withdrawal.  The 95% one -sided 
lower confidence limit of the observed primary effectiveness event -free 
rate will be compared to the performance goal of 50%. If the lower 
confidence limit is greater than the performance goal, the null hypothesis 
will be rejected. The lower confidence limit will be calculated as the 
pointwise confidence limit using the log-log methodology. 
Sample Size Parameters  The sam ple size estimate was obtained using the normal approximation

 Introduction  
 Background 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly encountered sustained cardiac arrhythmia in 
clinical practice ( 2). In the [LOCATION_002], the incidence of atrial fibrillation is estimated to 
increase from an estimated 2.66 million people in 2010 to as many as 12 million people by 2050 ( 3). It currently affects approximately 2.3 mi llion people in North America ( 4).  In 
addition, the prevalence and incidence of AF are increasing over time due to the aging of the population and a substantial increase in the a ge-specific occurrence of AF ( 5,6,7) .  Among 
Medicare beneficiaries, incident AF is common and increases as individuals age with incidence rates per 1,000 person- years reported at ages 70 -74 of 18.8, increasing to 28.8 for persons 75-
79 and 38.3 for persons 80- 84. Similarly, the overall prevalence among Medicare beneficiaries 
age 70 -74 is about 6% increasing to over 13% for individuals 80 years of age and older (8).   
AF causes symptoms that impair quality of life, increases the risk of stroke fivefold, and  
increases mortality.  
There are multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_850372]; however, it is recognized 
that many of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_850373]. Treatment options include medical management, pacing, cardioversion, implantable devices, surgery, and ablation therapy to eliminate the arrhythmia (9 ,10.11) .  It has been increasingly recognized that focal 
pulmonary vein (PV) triggers of AF can account for 80 to 95 percent of paroxysmal cases that 
are drug resistant.  As outlined in the  2017 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) consensus document, 
electrical isolation of the  pulmonary veins  is now recognized as the cornerstone of AF ablation. 
At most centers where AF ablation is performed, a strategy of creating a series of point -by-
point radiofrequency lesions that encircle the PVs is used.  
Although great progress has been made in improving the techniques and outcomes of AF 
catheter ablation, many challenges remain. Two of the current limitations of atrial fibrillation ablation include the use of catheters designed for pi[INVESTIGATOR_850374] -area 
ablations in a point-by-point fashion and the dexterity required to perform such a lesion set.   
A cryoballoon system for treatment of AF is comprised of components that deliver cryogenic 
refrigerant in a controlled fashion, from a reservoir located in a console through a conduit 
accessory and into a treatment catheter. The treatment catheter has a balloon at its distal end that is delivered to a target location within the patient’s heart. Once the balloon is positioned in the antrum of the target  PV, refrigerant is deliver ed to the balloon to extract heat from tissue 
in contact [CONTACT_792914].  By [CONTACT_850483], a PV may be isolated with a single 3 to 4‐ minute application of cryo‐ energy.  
The currently approved cryoablation technology (Arctic Front™/ Arctic Front Advance™ Cryoablation Balloon, Medtronic®) has completed two studies demonstrating effective therapy for PAF management with approximately 70% and 65% efficacy respectively ( 12,13). 
In addition to these efficacy and safety results, the simplicity of the procedure and the ability for average skilled interventionalists to match the results of elite RF operators provides 
cardiologists with the means to address the fast ‐growing patient numbers. Balloon catheter

  cryoablation therapy to treat Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) has gained significant 
utilization worldwide, with an estimated 370,000 procedures performed to date (1 4). 
Catheter and sheath performance for cryoablation balloon procedures has not changed since inception, more than ten years ago. Knowing that electrophysiologists are familiar with treating 
AF with cryo‐ therapy, the [LOCATION_011] Scientific Cardiac Cryoablation System  was designed wi th 
a clinical user focus  and set out to improve  the user experience.  This was accomplished by 
[CONTACT_850484], improving sheath maneuverability and incorporating 
general safety/ workflow im provements over current technology. 
Extensive pre ‐clinical and performance bench testing studies have been performed to date. A 
first-in-man clinical study was completed  in 2018 and its data is being used to obtain CE -mark.  
The data of up to 405 subjects who will undergo treatment with the [LOCATION_011] Scientific 
Cryoablation S ystem for de -novo P AF will be evaluated in this  IDE trial. This study seeks to 
obtain approval for the [LOCATION_011] Scientific Cryoablation System in North America.   
 Study Rationale  
The goal of any novel design or therapeutic strategy for AF is to restore normal sinus rhythm and to reduce or eliminate the symptoms due to rapid atrial response.  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific  developed a Cryoablation B alloon that can maintain constant and stable 
pressure during the entire procedure. A cryoablation balloon that has been designed to maintain 
constant pressure is likely to provide improved stability during all phases of the cryoablation, 
improving user experience and preserving the proven design validated by [CONTACT_13769]® 
Arctic Front Advance™ Catheter.  Accordingly, the present IDE study aims at collecting 
clinical data to establish the safety and one- year effectiveness profile of the Cryoablation 
System for treatment of symptomatic, drug refractory, recurrent, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  
 
 Device Description  
 [LOCATION_011] Scientific Cardiac Cryoablation System  
The [LOCATION_011] Scientific  Cardiac Cryoa blation System ( henceforth “Cryoablation System”) is 
intended for treatment of symptomatic, drug refractory, recurrent, paroxysmal AF.  The individual devices within the Cryoablation system and their associated model numbers are 
listed in  Table 1.  
Treatment will occur according to the approved indication for use within each geography and the defined inclusion/exclusion criteria within the protocol. A copy of the DFU will be provided in local language as required per national regulations.  FROzEN -AF will be conducted as a post market study in those regions where the device is 
approved, including Europe. For countries where commercially available, please refer to 
country- specific commercially available DFU.

 SMARTFREEZE Cryoablation System Console 
The SMARTFREEZE Cryoablation System Console is a device that uses N 2O provided from 
a refillable cylinder to safely pressurize (inflate) and cool the Cryoablation Catheter  to 
cryogenic ablative temperatures. The console houses the electrical and components and 
software/firmware needed to perform cryoablation procedures. It controls the delivery, recovery, and disposal of N
2O (cryoablation refrigerant) safely and efficiently. The Console 
user interface provides a means  for initiating and ceasing refrigerant delivery. Once the 
command is received from the console, N 2O is delivered as a chilled liquid to the 
Cryoablation Catheter for a programmable time duration.  The user interface also displays key information allowing the operator to focus attention on critical tasks and speed up the overall procedure.

Figure 5:  SMARTFREEZE Cryoablation System Console 
 
Integration between the Cryoablation Catheter and the Console includes monitoring catheter 
as well as console functionality , aided by a number of accessory devices  that make up the 
overall system  such as: power cords, extension cables, connection box, foot switch, 
diaphragmatic movement sensor, esophageal temperature sensor c able. In addition, the system 
incorporates a number of non- medical device items such as a scavenging hose, w rench , and 
nitrous oxide tank.   
 Diaphragm Movement Sensor  
The Diaphragm Movement Sensor (DMS)  is a patch device placed on the patient  just below 
the costal cartilage on the right side and used to monitor a phrenic nerve pacing response. It is connected to the Inter Connection Box ( ICB) sending data to be displayed on the user interface 
of the Console. By [CONTACT_850486], the user can be 
informed when the measured pacing response is lower than a pre -determined value set by [CONTACT_24201].  Phrenic nerve monitoring is a known and essential component in determining safety during a cryoablation procedure. The current standard- of-care technique which is used to monitor for 
phrenic nerve palsy  is to have the physician place his/her hand on the patient’s chest and assess 
the patient’s diaphragmatic movement during the period within the procedure that requires the physician’s full attention (when ablation is occurring).

  It has been reported with cryoablation balloon technology that the incidence of phrenic nerve 
injury ranges from 2.7% - 11.2% of patients undergoing a  cryoablation procedure. The 
physician subjectively decides when injury may be occurring based on the change in diaphragmatic movement during respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. The physician suspends ablation if there is a significant reduction in diaphragmatic movement. This is a manual and physician dependent technique where the incidence of occurrence is related to experience in the cryoablation procedure.  An accelerometer in the DMS detects any reduction of diaphragmatic movement indicating phrenic nerve impact, thus helpi[INVESTIGATOR_850383]. The DMS is connected to the ICB of the Cryoablation Console and 
sends data to be displayed on the Cryoablation Console’s user interface ( see Figure 6 below).

Phrenic Nerve Pacing Signal & Alert  
 By [CONTACT_850487], the physician can be informed when the measured pacing response falls below a pre -set value. The pre -determined value is 
programmed by [CONTACT_099]. The value is displayed as a percentage; with the first physical excursion establishing the baseline at 100%. The measurement display changes from “Blue” to “Red” if the value f alls below the physician’s programmed pre -set value (see Figure 6 
above).  The DMS is designed to be a used as an adjunct accessory to continually evaluate diaphragm movement during ablation; as a reminder alert to augment the established clinical practice  
described above for phrenic nerve assessment. The DMS is not a substitute for physician standard practice of phrenic nerve assessment during a cryoablation; i.e. physician palpation of the diaphragm, or attentive medical practice.

 Esophageal T emperature Sensor Cable  
Esophageal temperature monitoring is a frequently used technique; used more so when there 
is an anatomical concern related to the proximity of the esophagus to the inferior pulmonary veins and posterior wall of the Left Atrium (LA). The incidence of esophageal ulceration is generally reversible, with a reported incidence of 17% of patients.  As noted above, the ICB is designed to receive information from other proprietary devices such as an esophageal temperature probe. When connected, the esophageal temperature probe provides monitoring and alert data to the console for display. Esophageal te mperature probes 
are widely available in stand -alone measurement systems and used as such within the EP lab. 
The Esophageal Temperature Sensor Cable enables the connection of a commercially 
available 400 series temperature probe (for example, Truer Medical  [ADDRESS_1182218] No. 81- 020409) to be 
connected to the Console.  This feature integrates the detection of the esophageal temperature and provides a reminder alert to the physician if the esophageal temperature goes below a physician pre- set value. The 
measured esophageal temperature turns the measurement display from “Blue” to “Red” if the temperature probe falls below a physician pre -set value (see Figure 7 below) . This feature 
potentially reduces adverse events such as esophageal ulcerations and fistulas. This is a redundant safety alert system to the measurement systems used today although the alert is now displayed on the Console.

 Other Cryoablation System Devices  
 Inter Connection Box 
The ICB interfaces the Cryoablation Catheter with the Console. It receives the Catheter 
monitoring signals, DMS data, as well as information from other proprietary devices such as an esophageal temperature probe, a tip pressure sensor and various other safety systems.  The ICB then transmits this in formation to the Console for display and user analysis. 
 Console Foot Switch 
The Console Foot Switch interfaces with the Console and allows the user to inflate the Cryoablation Catheter, start and stop flow of N
2O (cryoablation) as well as deflate the 
Cryoablation Catheter at the conclusion of the ablation.

Term  Definition  
Atrioe sophageal Fistula  An atrioesophageal fistula is defined as a connection between the atrium 
and the lumen of the esophagus. Evidence supporting this diagnosis 
includes documentation of esophageal erosion combined with evidence of 
a fistulous connection to the atrium, such as air emboli, an embolic event, or direct observation at the time of surgical repair. A CT scan or MRI scan is the most common method of documentation of an atrioesophageal  
fistula.  
AV block  A conduction disturbance that results in the partial inability of an electrical 
impulse generated in the atria to reach the ventricles.  
Cardiac tamponade/perforation  Cardiac tamponade/ perforation  is defined as the development of a 
significant pericardial effusion during or within 30 days of undergoing an AF ablation procedure. A significant pericardial effusion is one that results in hemodynamic compromise, requires elective or urgent 
pericardiocentesis, or results  in a 1 -cm or more pericardial effusion as 
documented by [CONTACT_51541].  
Myocardial infarction (in  
the context of AF  
ablation)  The presence of any one of the following criteria:  
(1) detection of ECG changes indicative of new ischemia (new STT wave changes or new left bundle branch block, LBBB) that persist for more than 
1 hour;  
(2) development of new pathological Q waves on an ECG;  
(3) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional 
wall motion abnormality.  
Pericardial Effusion  A collection of fluid or blood in the pericardial space around the heart or in 
pleural space around the lungs.  
Phrenic nerve palsy  Phrenic nerve palsy  is defined as absent phrenic nerve function as assessed 
by a sniff test. A phrenic nerve  palsy  is considered to be permanent when it 
is documented to be present [ADDRESS_1182222] cavity.  
Pulmonary edema/heart failure  Ineffective pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_850392]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_850393], 
difficulty breathing when lying flat and leg or ankle swelling.

  Term  Definition  
Pulmonary Vein Stenosis 
(Severe) Pulmonary vein stenosis is defined as a reduction of the diameter of a PV 
or PV branch. PV stenosi s can be categorized as mild <50%, moderate 
50%–70%, and severe ≥70% reduction in the diameter of the PV or PV  
branch. A severe PV stenosis will count toward the primary safety 
endpoint.   
Stroke/Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)
  Stroke diagnostic criteria:  
• Rapid onset of a focal or global neurological deficit with at least one of the following: change in level of consciousness, 
hemiplegia, hemiparesis, numbness or sensory loss affecting one 
side of the body, dysphasia  or aphasia, hemianopia, amaurosis 
fugax, or other neurological signs or symptoms consistent with stroke.  
• Duration of a focal or global neurological deficit ≥ 24 hours; OR 
<24 hours if therapeutic intervention(s) were performed (e.g., thrombolytic therapy or intracranial angioplasty); OR available neuroimaging documents a new hemorrhage or infarct; OR the neurological deficit results in death.  
• No other readily identifiable non- stroke cause for the clinical 
presentation (e.g., brain tumor, trauma, infection, hypoglycemia, 
peripheral lesion, pharmacological influences).  
• Confirmation of the diagnosis by [CONTACT_37408]: 
neurology or neurosurgical specialist; neuroimaging procedure (MRI or CT scan or cerebral angiography); lumbar puncture (i.e., spi[INVESTIGATOR_28947] l fluid analysis diagnostic of intracranial hemorrhage)
  
• Stroke: (diagnosis as above, preferably with positive neuroimaging study);  
o Minor –Modified Rankin score <2 at 30 and 90 days†  
o Major –Modified Rankin score ≥[ADDRESS_1182223] migrated from another 
anatomic site.  
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)  New focal neurological deficit with rapid symptom resolution (usually 1 to 
2 hours), always within 24 hours; neuroimaging without tissue injury. 
Transient ischemic attack: new focal neurological deficit with rapid 
symptom resolution (usually 1 to 2 hours), always within 24 hours; 
neuroimaging without tissue injury  
Vagal Nerve 
Injury/Gastroparesis  Vagal nerve injury is defined as injury to the vagal nerve that results in 
esophageal dysmotility or gastroparesis.  Vagal nerve injury is considered 
to be a major complication if it prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requires 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], or results in ongoing symptoms for more than 30 days 
following an ablation procedure.  
Vascular access complications  Vascular access complications include the d evelopment of a hematoma, an 
AV fistula, or a pseudoaneurysm. A major vascular complication is defined as one that requires intervention, such as surgical repair or 
transfusion, prolongs the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], or requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].

 Scale and Duration 
A maximum of 4 05 subjects treated with the Cryoablation System will be enrolled in the 
study, inclusive of a maximum of 80 roll- in TREATMENT subjects and 325 non roll- in 
TREATMENT subjects undergoing the index ablation procedure (per subject status 
classification,  section 11.5) 
Fifty  (50) non roll- in TREATMENT subjects  will participate in a PV S tenosis S creening 
Substudy at up to [ADDRESS_1182232]/MRI imaging data post index procedure to evaluate the potential extent of PV stenosis.  Each site participating to the substudy will enroll a maximum of [ADDRESS_1182233] 50% of the  sites  and 50% of the subjects  will enroll in  the [LOCATION_002] and 
potentially up to 10% of  subjects  will enroll in  [ADDRESS_1182234] of 
individual center bias, no study site will be al lowed  to contribute more than 48 subjects  
(average 15% of the 325 study non roll- in TREATMENT subjects ).  
 
The enrollment period for this study is expected to last between [ADDRESS_1182235] 
will be followed at specified time points after the ablation  procedure (index procedure), with 
a follow-up duration of [ADDRESS_1182236]’s participation will be considered complete when all protocol required visits have been completed as indicated in Figure 8.  The total study duration is estimated to be approximately [ADDRESS_1182237]-approval requirements.

 Treatment Assignment  
All screened subjects who sign the informed consent will be considered enrolled.  Data will 
be collected during the baseline visit, the ablation (index) procedure, the pre- discharge visit , 
the Day [ADDRESS_1182241]/ follow up, month [ADDRESS_1182242] follow -up 
visits if appropriately delegated (section  12.6.1) and trained to complete the assigned tasks.   
 Justification for the Study Design  
 Single -Arm Study design 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific believes that a prospective non- randomized IDE trial with the Cryoablation 
System  as treatment device and powered for standard safety and effectiveness objective 
performance criteria is reasonable to obtain approval of the Cryoablation System . 
The rationale for a non- randomized trial includes, the formal equivalence of the system design 
with the existing Medtronic® Arctic Front Advance™ Catheter in terms of delivered therapy 
and temperature profiles, as proven by [CONTACT_850493]. 
Additionally, the current understanding in the field of catheter ablation of PAF and presence 
of an additional seven products approved by [CONTACT_850494] a single arm design adequate for this study. Inherent limitations of single arm trials compared to a randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be address ed by [CONTACT_850495]. This includes definition of inclusion/exclusion criteria to match the population enrolled in other IDE trials on PAF ablation and taking measures for subject  
screening and arrhythmi a recurrence surveillance.  
 Roll- ins and Non  Roll -in Treatment  Subjects  
To help facilitate investigators’ familiarity with the new investigational system and avoid 
learning curve bias , roll-in subjects will be enrolled at each study site. Each ablating physician 
will need to treat 1 (one) roll- in subject with the Cryoablation System per definition of 
Treatment in section 11.5.  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver AO 
   Confidential       FROzEN -AF study protocol, document 92348334, Rev I 
 Page 48 of 117 
 
   
After completing the treatment roll- in case, BSC will provide the investigator with 
authorization to proceed with the treatment  of the non roll- in subjects.  
 All safety and effectiveness data will be collected and reported for all  subjects; however, the 
data will not be included in the endpoint analyses for roll- in cases .   
In order to avoid potential bias, it is rec ommended the number of authorized active ablating 
physicians per investigational site  performing the index procedure is restricted to 2.  
For investigators participating in a geography in which the system is not investigational, a roll -
in case may not be r equired if the physician has previous experience treat ing patients with the 
Cryoablation System.   
 Subject Selection  
 Study Population and Eligibility  
Subjects enrolled in the FROzEN -AF study will be clinically indicated for an ablation 
procedure for the treatment of symptomatic, drug refractory, recurrent, paroxysmal atrial

exam and the enrollment date, otherwise a new echocardiogram (trans -thoracic or 
trans -esophageal, or intracardiac echo) must be performed to confirm eligibility 
prior to performing ablation.  For TTE, t he LA anteroposterior diameter measured 
by M -mode from the parasternal long- axis view will be used.  If both LA diameter 
and volume are available, only one meeting eligibility criteria is required.

**The absence of thrombus must be confirmed by [CONTACT_3553] a TEE  within 48 hours 
prior to the procedure or ICE during procedure  in subjects  not adequately  
antic oagulated (see section 12.5.2.)  for at least 3 weeks  prior to the procedure  OR 
with CHA 2DS 2-VASc score (see Appendix 30.4) ≥2 in men  and ≥3 in women OR 
enlarged LA (≥4.5c m). If a thrombus is observed, the subject no longer meets 
eligibility criteria. When  screening for thrombus prior to the index procedure, 
ensure that the anticoagulation approach as described in section 12.5.2. is 
followed until the day of the procedure.  
 Subject Accountability   
 Point of Enrollment  
Subjects who have signed and dated the Informed Consent Form are considered enrolled in 
the study.  All  TREATMENT subject s (per definition in section 12.3) will be counted against 
the enrollment ceiling of [ADDRESS_1182243] until the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed and dated by [CONTACT_423]. Screening tests that are part of SOC can be used to determine pre- eligibility. Study data from 
exams performed prior to consent/ enrollment (e.g. TTE) will be collected as medical history 
data after the subject  is consent ed/enrolled in the study.  It is the investigator’s site 
responsibility to assess eligibility criteria before obtaining the Informed Consent Form and document them for each screened patient in the study Screening  and Enrollment Log. 
 Enrollment Controls  
Subject  study- specific ID will be generated through the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system  
used for this study. This database will also be utilized to provide the sites with subject classification assignments (including roll-in subjects ) once a subject has provided written 
informed consent.  Enrollment controls will be put in place to ensure no  more than  48 (average 
15% of the  [ADDRESS_1182244] s) will occur at a single site .  In addition, BSC will 
communicate the process that will be followed for enrolling subjects as the enrollment ceiling of 325 TREATMENT subjects is approached to prevent exceeding this  enrollment ceiling.   
 Withdrawal  
All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical study) shall be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the clinical investigation, the reason(s) shall be reported. If such withdrawal is due to problems related to investigational device safety or performance, the investigator shall ask for the subject’s documented permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical study.    Reasons for withdrawal may include physician discretion, subject choice to withdraw , lost to 
follow- up, or death. While study withdrawal is discouraged, subjects may withdraw from the 
study at any time, with or without reason, and without prejudice to further treatment. In the event a subject does decide to with draw from the study, every effort should be made to obtain 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver AO 
   Confidential       FROzEN -AF study protocol, document 92348334, Rev I 
 Page [ADDRESS_1182245] has been 
withdrawn from the study or withdraws his/her consent, for whatever reason. Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal may be used, unless any local regulations apply which require removal of the data.   
If the withdrawal is due to the investigator’s discretion, the  investigator is obligated to follow 
all open reportable Adverse Events until they can be considered as closed or chronic. 
All open reportable adverse events should be closed or documented as chronic.  If the 
withdrawal is due to problems related to device  safety or performance, the investigator shall 
ask for the subject’s documented permission to follow his/her status/condition. 
Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. All applicable electronic case report forms (eCRFs) up to the point of subject withdrawa l/lost 
to follow up and an “End of Study” eCRF must be completed.   
 Lost to Follow- Up 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return after documented 
attempts to attend a scheduled visit and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_136589].  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit: 
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_850496]/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the inve stigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] ( at minimum 3 telephone calls and  a 
certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_585586] d in the participant’s medical 
record or study file.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered lost to follow-up from the study. 
 All applicable electronic case report forms (eCRFs) up to the point of subject withdrawal/lost to follow up and an “End of Study” eCRF must be completed.   
 Subject Status and Classification  
As subjects are evaluated, enrolled and treated in the study, they will be grouped into one of 
the following categories. Categorization will help determine how data gathered from them will be stored and evaluated. 
Consent Ineligible  (Screening Failures)

Treatment  
Any subject that signs the consent form, meets eligibility criteria and has the specified 
study device inserted into the body and received at least one Cryoablation application  
will be classified as “TREATMENT”. These subjects are followed in accordance wi th 
the follow -up schedule and included in all study analyses.  A subject ID will be assigned 
in the EDC system.  For TREATMENT subjects, all applicable case report forms per 
the protocol will be completed. Treatment subjects do count towards the enrollment 
ceiling and will be used for analyses of the endpoints. The original signed Informed Consent and any relevant documentation must be maintained in the center’s patient file. 
It is the investigational sites’s responsibility to list all Screen Failures, Conse nt Ineligible  
(screen ing failure) , Intent, Attempt and Treatment subjects on the Screening and Enrollment 
Log.  
 End-of-Study Definition

 Page [ADDRESS_1182259]- procedure AADs are allowed per physician’s discretion during the blanking 
period. New AADs should not be prescribed unless considered medically necessary.  If 
treatment with AAD is prescribed  during the blanking period, it is recommended that a Class 
I or III AAD be s elected according to the ACC/AHA/ESC [ADDRESS_1182260] for early arrhythmia recurrence that may require a repeat ablation procedure within the blanking period (on or before day 90). 
 AADs post [ADDRESS_1182261] be prescribed any dose of 
AAD*  for treatment of any atrial tachyarrhythmia after  the blanking period, the subject will be 
considered a Primary Effectiveness Failure.   
*AADs for endpoint will consist of all Class I/III and any Class II/IV medications taken for control of AF/AT/ AFL recurrence.    
Treatment with Class II/IV medications fo r conditions other than control of atrial arrhythmia 
recurrence is also permitted and will be documented.  Every effort should be made to keep those drugs at a stable dose over the entire course of the study.   
 Anticoagulation 
The following anticoagulation protocol is required for this study. An adequate anticoagulation 
regimen  is represented by [CONTACT_444035] 4 approaches listed in the paragraph titled “Pre -ablation”.  
Pre-ablation. 
Physicians can follow either an uninterrupted anticoagulation approach (Recommended), 
based on uninterrupted warfarin or NOAC, or minimally interrupted NOAC or an interrupted anticoagulation approach with adequate bridge with LMWH (Low Molecular Weight Heparin) . 
• Uninterrupted anticoagulation approach (recommended) includes one of the following options: 
 Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver AO  
   Confidential       FROzEN -AF study protocol, document 92348334, Rev  I 
 Page 60 of 117 
 
  1) Uninterrupted treatment with warfarin or NOAC*, requiring continued 
treatment including the day of the index procedure  
2) Minimally interrupted NOAC, requiring continued treatment but allowing to stop NOAC 12 to 24 hours before the index procedure (e.g. holding the morning dose the day of the procedure) 
• Interrupted anticoagulation approach includes one of the following options. 
3) If patient is on Warfarin, this should be stopped 5 days prior to the ablation procedure and bridged with LMWH. LMWH should be sto pped 12 hours prior 
ablation. 4) If patient is on NOAC, this should be stopped 5 days prior to the ablation procedure and bridged to Warfarin or bridged with LMWH. LMWH should be 
stopped 12 hours prior ablation. At the time NOAC is stopped , INR value shoul d 
be checked , if applicable, to ensure the Time of Therapeutic Range (TTR) are 
achieved with normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0.  
* Includes any of the FDA approved NOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban, api[INVESTIGATOR_470953])  Anticoagulation guidelines that pertain to cardioversion of AF should be adhered.  
If at the time of enrollment, a patient has not been anticoagulated as defined above  in the pre -
ablation  anticoagulation, anticoagulation must be initiated and maintained from point of 
enrollment to the  time of the index procedure . In the event that the patient has not been 
anticoagulated for at least [ADDRESS_1182262] be 
conducted as outlined in Section 12.5.3.   Intra ablation:  
• Heparin should be administered prior to transseptal puncture during AF catheter 
ablation procedures and adjusted to achieve and maintain an ACT of at least 300 seconds. The AC T level should be checked at 10 -15 minute intervals until therapeutic 
anticoagulation is achieved, and then at 15–30 minute intervals for the duration of the procedure.  
After ablation:  
• Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a NOAC is recommended for at least [ADDRESS_1182263] catheter ablation of AF. 
• Adherence to AF anticoagulation guidelines is recomm ended for patients who have 
undergone an AF ablation procedure, regardless of the apparent success or failure of the procedure.  
Decisions regarding continuation of systemic anticoagulation more than [ADDRESS_1182264] ablation should be based on the patient's stroke risk profile and not on the perceived success or failure of the ablation procedure.

 Page [ADDRESS_1182265] be confirmed by [CONTACT_3553] a TEE within 48 hours prior to 
the procedure or ICE during the procedure in subjects not adequately anticoagulated (see section 12.5.2) for at least 3 weeks prior to procedure  OR with CHA
2DS2-VASc score (see 
Appendix 30.4) ≥2 in men and ≥3 in women OR enlarged LA (≥4.5c m). When screening 
for thrombus prior to the index procedure, ensure that the anticoagulation approach as described in Section 12.5.2 is followed until the day of the procedure.  
 Index (Ablation) Procedure 
 General Info  
• Authorized ablating  physicians 
 
The study- related ablation procedure, from transseptal access in the left atrium until  end of 
the ablation procedure must be performed by [CONTACT_850497] (EP), trained to the FROzEN -AF clinical protocol and authorized by [CONTACT_850498]. The index ablation procedure must be p erformed within [ADDRESS_1182266]’s enrollment into the study.  To  avoid potential bias, it is recommended the 
number of  active ablating physicians performing the index procedure per investigational 
site is restricted to 2. [LOCATION_011] Scientific will theref ore authorize a maximum of 2 active 
ablating physicians per site  except in regions where the Cryoballoon System is 
commercially available . 
 
• De novo procedures 
For the purposes of this protocol, de novo procedures are defined as AF procedures in which there  has been no prior ablation in the Left Atrium (LA). According to subject  
selection criteria, all Index procedures in this study are de -novo as history of previous left 
atrial ablation or surgical treatment for AF/ AFL / AT constitute an exclusion criterion . 
• Esophagus management  
Esophagus management must be performed by [CONTACT_850499]. A commercially available temperature 
probe compatible with the Cryoablation system, will be us ed with measurements acquired 
and displayed through the Console. If the esophageal temperature falls below 20 °C during 
cryoablation applications, the ablation will be stopped until esophageal temperature returns to baseline. 
• Phrenic nerve activity monitoring 
o Index Procedure:  
 During ablation phrenic nerve activity monitoring will be performed. 
The phrenic nerve will be paced with a focal or circular catheter, higher 
than the ablation position during all right sided vein ablations. If a 
reduction in phrenic response is detected, the operating physician will 
 Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver AO  
   Confidential       FROzEN -AF study protocol, document 92348334, Rev  I 
 Page 62 of 117 
 
  continue to closely monitor phrenic nerve activity and pacing capture , 
and will consider immediately interrupting cryoablation  
 After ablation, prior to leaving the EP lab, fluoroscopy of diaphragm 
movement will be performed at the c ompletion of the ablation procedure  
o Discharge:  
 All patients presenting with phrenic nerve palsy at the end of the index 
procedure will be re -assessed  at the discharge visit for phrenic nerve 
palsy  via sniff test or an inhalation -exhalation chest radiography of the 
diaphragm 
o At Follow -up Visits: 
 Patients with  unresolved phrenic nerve palsy  detected at  discharge visit, 
should be assessed by [CONTACT_850500] -exhalation 
chest radiography of the diaphragm to evaluate if the event resolved 
• Three-dimensional electroanatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
3D electro -anatomical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850399]. If 3D mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850400], a commercially available device will be used, and the following information 
will be collected: mappi[INVESTIGATOR_169228] , 3D mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850401]. 
 Pulmonary Vein Isolation  
The goal of the ablation procedure is electrical isolation of all clinically relevant PVs .  
Electrical isolation of the veins must be demonstrated by [CONTACT_850490].  
If the subject i s in AF prior to the ablation, it will be up to the physician’s discretion whether 
to cardiovert or proceed with the procedure with the subject in AF.  Electrocardiographic documentation of the subject’s rhythm prior to ablation will be collected.  
 Cryoabla tion System P reparation  
The Console will create a record for each ablation attempted, including Ablation Duration, Cryoballoon Temperature, Esophagus Temperature (if connected) and DMS activity data. In order to accurately capture information relevant to the study, the following information must be input into the Console at each index procedure: 
 
Prior to Ablation:   
• On the subject  information screen, enter the subject’s identification (code provided by 
[CONTACT_850501]) and the operating physician name. 
• For the purpose of this study, the DMS must be connected to the subject during right PV ablations (for data acquisition). The DMS is an adjunctive sensor designed to monitor a phrenic nerve pacing response.  Standard of care methods for evaluating phrenic nerve function and determining when intervention is needed (e.g. palpation, 
 Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver AO  
   Confidential       FROzEN -AF study protocol, document 92348334, Rev  I 
 Page 63 of 117 
 
  ICE) should always be applied during right pulmonary vein ablations. The DMS is 
not intended as a substitute for such standard of care methods.       
1. Place a disposable ECG electrode just below the right side costal cartilage.  
2. Snap the DMS onto the electrode. 
3. Ask the patient to cough and verify that signal is visible on the console screen. Adjust the position of the electrode if necessary. 
Prior to performing the ablation, pace the phrenic nerve with a focal or 
circular catheter positioned superior to the ablation location (e.g. superior vena cava). Adjust the pacing settings and catheter location as necessary to attain phrenic nerve capture. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], high output at 20 mA and 800 – 1000 milliseconds  (ms) may be needed.  
NOTE:   Avoid or minimize use of paralytics if general anesthesia is used as 
paralytics may interfere with pacing capture of the phrenic nerve.  
4. While pacing the phrenic nerve, adjust the DMS gain and sensitivity levels within the Settings screen to maximize the DMS signal level in the display window. Reduce the gain if the DMS signal appears saturated. Stop pacing until needed for the ablation.  
5. Set the DMS threshold (within the Settings screen) for which the DMS notification will be displayed . The suggested DMS threshold setting is  65% , 
but. the threshold can be adjusted per physician discretion. 
• The movement amplitude measured by [CONTACT_850502] 100%. 
• If the phrenic nerve pacing response decreases during cryoablation, the DMS amplitude will correspondingly decrease. The console will display the DMS amplitude as a percentage of the baseline value. For example, 80% displayed on the console indicates the DMS amplitude is 80% of the baseline valve and that movement amplitude is reduced by 20%.  
6. In case of a DMS notification, continue to closely monitor phrenic nerve activity and pacing capture, and consider immediately interrupting cryoablation.  
 
During Each Ablation Application:   
• Annotate t he ablation site, mark the Time -To-Isolation, and set the Ablation Duration.  
 Cryoablation protocol   
The ablation procedure should follow this recommended sequence: Prepare patient with conscious sedation or general anaesthesia. Prepare the vascular acces s sites per physician 
preference.  Follow anticoagulation protocol in section 12.5.2. 
 Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver AO  
   Confidential       FROzEN -AF study protocol, document 92348334, Rev  I 
 Page 64 of 117 
 
  1. Intracardiac echo (ICE) may be performed to support the procedure. Record any 
observation of cardiac structural damage, any evidence of pericardial effusion, or any 
visible anomalies on the CRF. 
2. Place additional diagnostic catheters, for example in the coronary sinus or for pacing the phrenic nerve, at the discretion of the physician. 
3. Per institutional protocol, complete transseptal access (single or double).  
4. Baseline the fluoroscopy exposure time.  
5. Per the DFU, prepare the steerable sheath. Insert the steerable sheath over the guidewire and advance the sheath across the atrial septum. 
6. Per the D FU, prepare the cryoablation catheter and the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_169228]. Insert the 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850402]. Insert the Cryoablation Catheter into 
the steerable sheath and advance it into the left atrium.  
7. Baseline the LA dwell time . 
8. Advance the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850403] , 
including confirm ing conduction between LA and PV. 
9. Inflate the cryoballoon and occlude the targeted PV. Confirm and grade the occlusion using fluoroscopy with contrast injection .  
10. Position the esophagus temperature probe as directly posterior to the cryoballoon as possible.  
11. If the selected vessel is a right PV, start phrenic nerve pacing prior to starting the cryoablation. 
12. Start the cryoablation and observe the electrogra ms for changes in conduction. 
Identify Time -To-Isolation and set ablation duration as required by [CONTACT_850503] (document 92355401 provided separately). Investigators may 
apply a different dosing than the one provided in this document for reasons including technical difficulties, anatomical challenges, or concerns for subject welfare.    
13. Upon completing the ablation, determine if entrance and exit block were achieved. If entrance and exit block are not confirmed, ablate the PV a gain as required  by [CONTACT_850504] (document 92355401). Investigators may apply a different 
dosing than the one provided in this document for reasons including technical difficulties, anatomical challenges, or concerns for subject welfare.   If entrance and 
exit block are confirmed, reposition the system to target another PV. 
 PV isolation verification  
Electrograms from the POLARMAP mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850404]/from  the PVs . The  PV will only be considered isolated if  entrance and  exit 
block are confirmed . Electrogram data must be documented.

 Additional ablation(s) 
Additional ablatio n of non-PV foci that initiate AF (including locations in the LA, RA, or 
SVC) , targeting complex fractionated electrograms or ganglionated plexi or performing left 
atrial mitral isthmus or roof lines are not allowed  in this protocol.  
Additional a blation of the  cavo -tricuspid isthmus (CTI)  with a conventional market approved 
RF catheter is allowed  only in case a typi[INVESTIGATOR_850405] (either spontaneously or inducible). 
The Cryoablation System cannot be used for the ablation of other arrhythmia(s)/additional 
line(s) or a pplications outside the PVs. 
It is not allowed to perform concomitant procedures during the ablation procedure (e.g. ICD 
implant, PM, LAAC).   
If the subject presents with AF after all ablations are complete, cardioversion should be 
performed and will be noted.  Cardioversions during the Index procedure do not signify procedural failures and are not to be reported as adverse events.  Induction of or spontaneous conversion to AF during the procedure will not be considered an adverse event.   
If at any time d uring the ablation procedure the investigator is unable to continue the ablation 
with the designated investigational catheter (for the PV isolation), the investigator may 
consider the case a procedural failure and complete the case with a device determined  best for 
the subject.  The point at which failure was determined as well as the rationale must be documented.  A protocol deviation will be documented in the EDC  system . 
 Index procedure collected data  
The following data related to the  procedure  will be collected:

 Additional /Repeat  Procedure 
In case an additional procedure (including but not limited to a repeat  ablation procedure for 
PAF) occurs during the month 12 follow-up period, the data of this procedure will be entered 
in the ‘Additional / Repeat  Procedure’ eCRF.  In case this additional procedure is an ablation 
procedure (for the same, or different arrhythmias or for an unsuccessful ablation of the arrhythmia presented at index procedure), detailed information about this additional ablation procedure will be entered in the ‘Additional /Repeat  Procedure’ eCRF:  
• Was the additional ablation procedure performed in the LA? If yes, TEE or ICE to 
rule out presence of left atrial thrombus.  *** 
• For additional ablation procedures performed in the LA: w as this additional ablation 
procedure performed to treat AF?  If no, specify the arrhythmia type.

  It is known that a repeat ablation procedure for PAF may be necessary in certain 
subjects after the index ablation procedure due to recurrences of PAF or other tachyarrhythmias requiring treatment.  One repeat ablation procedure for PAF is allowed within the blanking period if considered medically necessary due to patient’s intolerability of the PAF.  If the repeated ablation procedure occurs during the 
blanking period (within 90 days of the Index procedure) it is recommended to use the Cryoablation system. Use of a non-study device for AF re -ablation during blanking 
period constitutes a failure for the e ffectiveness endpoint.   Data for the repeat 
ablation procedure will be collected in the eCRF . 
Subjects must follow the same anticoagulation requirements as defined for the index procedure in s ection 12.5.2 prior to proceeding with the repeat ablation procedure for 
PAF.

of the diaphragm to evaluate if the event resolved   
• Protocol deviations, if applicable 
The appropriate type of pre -procedure imaging (CT/MRI) is to be determined by [CONTACT_1275].  As available, the PV images must be reviewed against the pre -ablation imaging 
from the index procedure to rule out PV stenosis from the index ablation procedure.

Each Treatment subject will be followed until the month [ADDRESS_1182276] scheduled procedure shown in the Data Collection Schedule.  
 
In case of premature termination of the study, please refer to s ection 24.  
Following termination/completion of the study, subjects will be managed according to local 
institution practice.

  Unforeseen Circumstances (Natural Disaster/Global Pandemic)  
There may be unforeseen circumstances that occur during the course of the study, such as a 
natural disaster or a global pandemic (e.g. COVID-19) that prevents a subject from attending study visits during the required follow-up window. While every attempt should be made to avoid disruptions in collecting study data, it is important to collect as much data as possible, by [CONTACT_850508]. This may include obtaining records from an outside clinic, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850417]/EC/REB approved.  
In the event that study data must be collected remotely, every effort should be made to 
collect the data within the study visit window, if possible. Critical data collected during the study includes any procedure or device related adverse events, recurrence of any AF/AT/AFL, and a Cardiac CT or MRI (if PV stenosis is suspected). Event monitors and 24- hour Holter monitors can be used to detect any recurrence of AF/AT/AFL. If a Cardiac CT or MRI is required because PV stenosis is suspected, the Cardiac CT or MRI may be performed at another healthcare facility and the window to conduct this test may be extended by [CONTACT_796456] (30 days) following the normal study visit window.

 Statistical Considerations  
 Endpoints 
 Primary Safety Endpoints 
The expected safety event rate for the primary safety endpoint has been estimated by 
[CONTACT_746] a meta -analysis on recently completed IDE studies ( see Table 1 1). Although 
referring to the first -generation Cryoballoon (Arctic Front™ Balloon, Medtronic®), the STOP -
AF IDE study was included in the model as it is the only reported IDE study that utilizes a cryoablation balloon. Event rates and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated from 
 Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver AO  
   Confidential       FROzEN -AF study protocol, document 92348334, Rev  I 
 Page 75 of 117 
 
  SSED, primary publications or results disclosed on clinicaltrials.gov  and calculated based on 
the occurrence of the events that constitute the primary safety endpoint defined in this protocol. 
 
Table 11: Meta -Analysis to Determine Expected rate and 95% CI for Primary Safety 
Endpoint  
 
The overall safety event rate from this meta -analysis is 6.05%. All the studies passed their pre -
specified primary safety endpoint and established that the device  under study exhibited an 
acceptable safety profile. In conclusion, BSC proposes a primary safety endpoint expected 
event rate of 6%  (94% event -free rate). A performance goal for the primary safety endpoint 
was derived using the sum of the 95% upper confidence bound of the meta -analysis rate and a 
margin of indifference that is 50% of the upper confidence bound (7.2% + 0.5*7.2%) . This 
resulted in a performance goal of 11% (89% event- free rate).  
 Hypotheses 
Ho:  The primary safety endpoint event- free rate at [ADDRESS_1182277] procedure ≤89% 
Ha:  The primary safety endpoint event-free rate at [ADDRESS_1182278]  procedure >8 9%  
 Sample Size  
Minimum of 325 non roll -in TREATMENT subjects treated with the Cryoablation System.   
Additionally, all ATTEMPT subjects will be included in the primary safety endpoint analysis.  
The sample size estimate was obtained using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution and verified through simulations based on Kaplan-Meier methodology. The following assumptions were used in the sample size calculation: 
Assumptions  Primary 
Safety  
Expected rate  94%

  Performance goal  89% 
Attrition (per year)  10% 
Significance level  (one-sided)  5% 
Power  90% 
Patients after attrition  325 
 Statistical Methods  
The 12 month (365- day) primary safety event -free rate will be calculated using Kaplan -Meier 
methodology. Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to 12 months without experiencing 
an event will be censored on the date of withdrawal.  The 95% one -sided lower confidence 
limit of the observed safety event -free rate will be compared to the performance goal of 8 9%. 
If the lower confidence limit is greater than the performanc e goal, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected. The lower confidence limit will be calculated as the pointwise confidence limit using the log-log methodology. 
 Secondary Safety Endpoint  
Reportable Adverse Events rates at [ADDRESS_1182279] follow -up visits. Reportable events include: 
• All Serious Adverse Events 
• All Study Procedure- Related Adverse Events  
• All Study Device- Related Adverse Events  
• All Study Device Deficiencies  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects/Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device 
Effects previously not defined in DFU/Investigator’s Brochure 
 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
An effectiveness performance goal of 50% has been chosen based on the minimum chronic acceptable success rate for paroxysmal AF at 12 -month follow -up defined in 2017 HRS 
Consensus document (ref). When considering recurrence of AF/AT/ AFL , obtained in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_850419] (STOP AF and FIRE & ICE) the starting point for the estimate failure -free rate was set as  the one obtained for the second generation cryoballoon (FIRE & 
ICE: 66%), Effectiveness results are not easily poolable as aggregate  from recent IDE studies on AF ablation to difference in methodology and definitions found in the selected trials when evaluating the freedom from AF/AT/ AFL  recurrences off AADs after 3 -months blanking 
period. Accordingly, an estimate of the failure -free rate taking into account recurrence of 
symptomatic and asymptomatic events has been estimated from the data of the recently  
concluded ZERO -AF trial from [LOCATION_011] Scientific, that led to the choice of 60% was based on 
as expected rate.

Ha:  The 12 -month failure- free rate >50% 
 Sample Size  
Two hundred forty -nine non roll- in TREATMENT subjects treated with the Cryoablation 
System . 
The sample size estimate was obtained using the normal approximation to the binomial

Patients after attrition  249 
 Statistical Methods  
For the primary effectiveness endpoint, the Kaplan- Meier 12 month (365- day) primary 
effectiveness event -free rate will be calculated. Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to 
12 months without experiencing an event will be censored on the date of withdrawal.  The 95% 
one-sided lower confidence limit of the observed primary effectiveness event -free rate will be 
compared to the performance goal of 50%. If the lower confidence limit is greater than the performance goal, the null hypothesis will be rejected. The l ower confidence limit will be 
calculated as the pointwise confidence limit using the log -log methodology. 
 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint

 Control of Syste matic Error/Bias  
Selection of patients will be made from the Investigator’s population. All patients meeting the 
eligibility criteria and having signed the ICF will be eligible for enrollment in the study.  Control and reduction of potential bias associated with a single -arm study design have been 
taken into account by [CONTACT_163297] a series of measures including but not limited to: 
• defining inclusion and exclusion criteria to represent a population similar to the one enrolled in recently completed trials on AF ablation;  
• implementing a screening log to document reason(s) for screening failure and a pre -
specified analysis on screening failures;  
• employing a rhythm surveillance monitoring strategy that is equivalent to that used in recent PAF IDE studies and cons istent with the relevant recommendation in the HRS 
consensus document;  
• utilizing core lab for reviewing electrocardiographic recordings from study specific  
rhythm surveillance monitoring after the blanking period. 
 Study Success and Control of Type I Error  
As this study was designed to address the safety and effectiveness of the [LOCATION_011] Scientific Cardiac Cryoablation System, there is one primary safety endpoint and one primary effectiveness endpoint.  Both the primary endpoints must pass in order for study success to be achieved.  Each primary endpoint would be tested at a significance level of 5% while still maintaining the overall Type I error level at no greater than 5%.  This follows the methodology of the Intersection-Union Test (IUT).  If all primary endpoints for a given study are passed, then the secondary effectiveness endpoint will be tested at alpha = 0.05. 
 Number of Subjects per Investigative Site  
To avoid any center effect and bias, one center will not be authorized to enroll more than [ADDRESS_1182280] s (15% of the minimum 325 enrollment total of non roll- in TREATMENT subjects ). 
 Data Analyses 
 Interim Analyses  
No formal interim analyses are planned for the purpose of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_850420].  Analysis of each endpoint will be performed when all applicable data for that endpoint has been collected. 
 Missing Data Analyses  
Because endpoints will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier methodology, all TREATMENT 
subjects will contribute data to the primary effectiveness endpoint and all TREATMENT and 
ATTEMPT subjects will contribute data to the primary safety endpoint. A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_850421]/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver AO  
   Confidential       FROzEN -AF study protocol, document 92348334, Rev  I 
 Page [ADDRESS_1182281] ’s 
data will be evaluated along with the actual observed data to find the point at which the endpoint would have failed. 
 Subgroup Analyses  
An analysis will be performed for the primary endpoints to determine whether significant differences exist in endpoint results between subgroups.  The list of covariates (with applicable subgroups in parentheses) includes the following: 
• Sex (Female vs. Male)  
• Age at time of consent ( subjects > 60 years vs subjects ≤60 years ) 
• Geography (International vs. [LOCATION_002]) 
• Enrollment criteria ( protocol version s A-G vs. subsequent protocol versions)  
Each subgroup covariate will be included as a single independent variable in a logistic 
regression model with the primary endpoint outcome as the dependent variable and a test for 
significance at the 15% level will be performed .  
In addition to subgroup analyses, descriptive statistics of subject demographic and baseline 
characteristics will be presented for each subgroup listed in this section. 
 Center Pooling Analysis 
Center -to-center heterogeneity will be assessed for the primary endpoints by [CONTACT_746] a 
random effects logistic regression analysis.  Centers with less than five enrollments will be 
combined to form “supercenters”. Small centers will be combined until the newly created supercenter has five enrollments, and then a new supercenter will be created. Centers will be deemed to be heterogeneous if the variance of the random center effect  is found to significantly 
differ from zero.  A significance level of 15% will be used for this test. 
 Multivariable Analyses 
For each primary endpoint, univariate analyses of the following covariates will be performed, and any found to be significantly ass ociated with the outcome at the .[ADDRESS_1182282] of baseline covariates includes, but is not necessarily limited to:  
• Subject demographics (e.g. age, gender) 
• Subject baseline characteristics (e.g. LVEF  and LA diameter)  
• Procedural techniques (e.g., esophageal temperature monitoring,) 
 Additional Analyses  
 Additional endpoints and analyses include, but are not limited to:

  • Changes in the quality of life measures (AFEQT and EQ-5D- 5L) between baseline 
and 12 months follow up 
• Single procedure success, defined as freedom from primary effectiveness failure 
witho ut a repeat procedure  
• Duration of LA dwell time, defined as time from the Cryoablation Catheter exiting the sheath in the LA to time of final PV isolation;

• Total fluoroscopy time for the index procedure; 
• Total index procedure time; 
• Freedom from recurrence of individual types atrial arrhythmias between [ADDRESS_1182283] index procedure: 1) AF 2) AT 3) AFL;  
• Failure - free rate as defined in primary effectiveness endpoint when considering 
AF/AT/AFL epi[INVESTIGATOR_850394] (event recorder transmissions, 12 lead ECG and Holter) and non-study related devices (other commercial applications for arrhythmia monitoring and detection the subject may access during the study including telemetry, other sources of continuous recording etc.);  
Freedom from primary effectiveness failure at six (6) months will be included in the final study report as a “proof-of-concept” analysis to potentially show the ability to predict 1- year 
effectiveness results using 6- month effectiveness data.    
 Changes to Planned Analyses 
Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the analyses will be documented in an amended Statistical Analysis Plan approved prior to performing the analys es.  
Changes from the planned statistical methods after performing the analyses will be documented in the clinical study report along with a reason for the deviation. 
 Health Economics Outcomes  
A formal health economics analysis may be completed as part of this trial study, given meaningful clinical results are obtained. This will take into consideration complication rates, quality of life, and resource utilization. The EQ -5D, generic quality of life measure, will be 
used to assess health utilities. We may estimate costs associated with the health care utilization measures at all sites. These inputs may be used in health economics analysis performed.

been designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies pertaining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are performed regularly.  
The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature [CONTACT_5760] (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature [CONTACT_5761] [CONTACT_1295]. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_5732]. 
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies. 
Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC s ystem and will be issued to the 
site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all queries in the database.  
Data transfers from other systems such as core labs and electronic questionnaires will be coordinated by [CONTACT_850509].  
CRF Completion Guidelines will be created by [CONTACT_850510].  
 Data Retention  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee or Investigational site will maintain  all essential 
study documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study subjects in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.   
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee will take measures to prevent accidental or  
premature destruction of these documents. If for any reason the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her 
designee withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change. Sites are required to inform [LOCATION_011] Scientific in writing where paper or electronic files are maintained in case files are stored off site and are not readily available.  
 Technical Source Forms  
The Technical Source Form (TSF) is the sponsor- approved document to capture protocol

 Core Laboratories 
 Event  and 24- Hour Holter Monitors ’ Core Lab 
 Event Monitors 
A Core Lab  will provide the center and/or subject all necessary instructions and/ or materials 
related to the use of the event monitor.  Only TREATMENT subjects will be provided with an event monitor, such as a Trans-Telephonic Monitor (TTM), either prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850422]’s residence immediately following discharge.  All events will be analyzed by [CONTACT_850513][INVESTIGATOR_850423].  The Core Lab  will make this information accessible 
to the Investigat or center for concurrence.  If there is discordance in arrhythmia classification 
between the Core Lab  and the investigator, a third-party cardiologist will be used for final 
rhythm determination. Within the first 90 days (3 months) after the index ablation procedure (blanking period), TREATMENT subjects will be instructed to transmit all symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_850424]/or treatment of early recurrences.  After the subject’s [ADDRESS_1182286] two transmissions per month  (either symptomatic or 
asymptomatic ) through the 12- month follow- up to ensure continued reporting compliance. If 
subjects experience symptoms associated with cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea), they will be instructed to transmit a recording. Such recording will count towards the required transmission of that period. The Core Lab  will work 
with the investigational site  to ensure reporting compliance.   
All event monitors must be returned to the centralized research company upon completion of a subject’s [ADDRESS_1182287] has a symptomatic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_850425], they will be strongly encouraged to report the

severe PV stenosis.  The C ore Lab will report the degree of narrowing (None, mild 50%, 
moderate 50 -70%, severe ≥70%) in the follow -up scan compared to baseline.  All results will 
be provided both to BSC and to the investigator for adverse event reporting, if applicable.  
If PV stenosis is a suspected adverse event for subjects not partaking in the PV Imaging sub-study, the PV Imaging core lab will also review the pre -ablation and post -ablation PV images 
collected on non-sub- study subjec ts to assess the degree of narrowing of the PV diameter for 
the Primary Safety Endpoint.  If it is determined that the baseline diameter of the vein of interest is not visually identifiable from the pre -ablation image, the PV Imaging core lab will 
measure the diameter of the vein before and after the narrowing region to determine the 
percentage change.  The results of the analysis will be provided to the investigator for submission of an adverse event, if applicable.  All necessary data will be provided to the study’s independent clinical events committee (CEC) for adjudication of the submitted adverse event, with a definition of severe PV stenosis being defined as ≥70% reduction in diameter from 
baseline.  
 Quality of Life (QOL)  
Clinical trials increasingly r ecognize the value of including patient reported outcome measures 
in their design. To understand the impact of atrial fibrillation ablation procedures on patient’s quality of life, the quality of life instruments used for the trial will be the EQ -5D- 5L for a 
generic questionnaire and the AFEQT for disease specific. Subjects will be asked to complete the questionnaires at the Enrollment visit as well as at the three, six, and 12- month follow -ups.   
The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT) was developed to evaluate disease -
specific quality of life for patients with atrial fibrillation. The 20 -item questionnaire is 
subdivided into three domains: symptoms, daily activities, and treatment concerns with responses provided on a seven-point Likert scale.  
The EQ -5D, generic quality of life measure, will be used to assess health utilities. It is a 
descriptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions 
(mobil ity, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can 
take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no problems/slight 
problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a part icular EQ -5D 
dimension.

 Potential Risks and Benefits 
 Anticipated Adverse Events  
Subjects participating in this study are subject to the same risks shared by [CONTACT_850519].  Since the handling characteristics of 
the Cryoablation System are designed to be similar to those of other approved catheters for AF 
ablation , it is anticipated that the rate of catheter -related complications in  this study will be 
similar to those reported from catheter ablations performed with approved catheter ablation systems.  The protocol -required testing for this study uses standard techniques that are 
routinely used for the treatment and management of subjects with drug refractory PAF.

 Risks Associated with the Study Device(s)  
Benchtop studies, pre- clinical research and a CE Mark clinical study have demonstrated that 
the System is safe for human use. All potential risks have been evaluated and mitigation 
strategies have been implemented to reduce potential risks to acceptable levels.  
 Risks associated with Participation in the Clinical Study  
There are no specific tests outside those recommended as  standard practice  for catheter ablation 
of PAF  required by [CONTACT_239204]. Therefore, there is no foreseen increased risk 
to subjects for participating in the FROzEN -AF Study. 
 Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, using the devices in accordance with their applicable Directions for Use, performing the procedures following recommended standard practices/guidelines, performing procedures in the appropriate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365], adheren ce to subject selection criteria, close monitoring 
of the subject's physiologic status during research procedures and/or follow -ups and by 
[CONTACT_71653]. 
 Anticipated Benefits  
Subjects may or  may not receive any benefit from participating in this study as compared to 
the current standard of care received for treatment of PAF . Potential benefits of the 
Cryoablation System for the subject may include the following: 
• Complete or partial reduction in symptoms related to PAF  
• Complete or partial reduction in the number of cardioversions, medications a subject is

 Safety Reporting 
 Reportable Events  by [CONTACT_850520]:  
Reportable Events:  
• All Serious Adverse Events; 
• All Events Leading to Death  
• All Thromboembolic Events 
• All Procedure Related AEs  inclusive of AEs  related to the assessments ( TTE, TEE, 
ICE or CT/MRI scan ) listed in section 12.4. 
• All BSC commercialized diagnostic catheter -related events  
• All Cryoablation S ystem  Device Related Adverse Events;  
• All Device Deficiencies related to the study device;  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects/Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects previously not defined in the DF U/IB and ICF . 
•  
Whenever possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of individual symptoms. 
If it is unclear whether or not an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot 
be isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or device deficiency.  
Death should not be recorded as an AE  but should only be reflected as an outcome of one (1) 
specific SAE  (see Table 13 for Safety Definitions).  
If an additional ablation procedure is required, this additional ablation procedure should not be 
considered as an Adverse Event, unless associated with subject worsening condition or a new diagnosis. If the investigator considers this event to be related to any procedure, the event needs to be reported. In this case, the additional ablation procedure should be reported in the Adverse Event eCRF as corrective action of the speci fic Procedure Related Adverse Event reported for 
the worsening condition or new diagnosis. 
If the patient experiences a new arrhythmia between the index procedure and the end of study, and the investigator considers this Adverse Event to be procedure related, it needs to be

Event  
Classification  Description  
Not Related  
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3  Relationship to the device , comparator  or procedures can be excluded when:  
- the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to 
or of similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device or 
the procedures;  
- the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device 
(if the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event;  
- the event involves a body- site, or an organ not expected to be affected by [CONTACT_5746];  
- the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying  
or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment 
or other risk factors);  
- the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_5747], when applicable; harms to the subject are not clearly due to use 
error;  
- In order to  establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be 
met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious 
event.

  Possibly Related  
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3  The relationship with the use of the investigational device  or comparator, or the 
relationship with procedures  is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. 
Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ 
clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases were 
relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also be 
classified as possible.  
Probably Related  
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3  The relationship with the use of the investigational device or comparator, or the 
relationship with procedures  seems relevant and/or the event cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained.  
Causal Relationship  
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3  The serious event is associated with the investigational device or with procedures beyond reasonable doubt when:  
- the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or 
of similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has a temporal relationship with investigational device use/application 
or proc edures;  
- the event involves a body- site or organ that  
-the investigational device or procedures are applied to; -the 
investigational device or procedures have an effect on;  
- the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known);  
- the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the serious event ( when clinically feasible); 
- other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition 
or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out; 
- harm to the subject is due to error in use;  
- the even t depends on a false result given by [CONTACT_5749], when applicable;  
- In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met 
at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious 
adverse event.

All device deficiencies (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, use errors, product 
nonconformities, and inadequacy in the information supplied by [CONTACT_3455]) ass ociated 
with the study devices (Cryoablation System) will be documented and reported to BSC. If possible, the device(s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for returning the study catheters will be provided in the Site Initiation Visit slides. If it is not possible to return the device, the investigator should document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of the device. Device failures and malfunctions should also be documented in the subject’s medical record.  
Device deficiencies (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, and product nonconformities) are not adverse events. However, a reportable event that results from a device failure or malfunction, would be recorded as an adverse event on the appropriate eC RF. 
For Device Deficiencies, the investigator must assess and report if the device deficiency could have led to a serious adverse event if a) suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate is considered a reportable event.  
 Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs/ ECs/ REBs / Investigators

population to be re-consented. 
 
 Committees  
 Safety Monitoring Process 
To promote early detection of safety issues, the Clinical Events Committee and Data 
Monitoring Committee will provide evaluations of safety events. Success of this program requires dynamic collection of unmonitored data as soon as the event is reported. During regularly scheduled monitoring activities , clinical research monitors will support the dynamic 
reporting process through their review of source document and other data information.
  
The BSC personnel from the Medical Safety and Safety Trial Operation Teams  review safety 
data as it is reported by [CONTACT_113657]. The BSC Medical Safety 
group includes health care providers  with expertise in Electrophysiology and with the 
necessary therapeutic and subject matter expertise to evaluate and classify the events into the categories outlined above.
 
 Clinical Events Committee   
A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) is an independent group of individuals with pertinent expertise that will adjudicate events reported by [CONTACT_850524]. 
• All Deaths

  • All Adverse Events included in the composite primary safety endpoint per Section 8.2 
of Protocol 
• All Adverse Event that are potentially related to the procedure or any of the devices included in the POLARx Cardiac Cryoablation System 
• All unanticipated device effects.  
• Other events at the discretion of BSC 
 
Committee members will include practitioners of Electrophysiology (EP), and/ or Cardiology, as well as other experts with the necessary therapeutic and subject matter expertise to adjudicate the event categories outlined above.  A complete description of CEC responsibilities, qualifications, membership, and committee procedures will be outlined in the CEC charter.   
The CEC will review a safety event dossier, prepared by [CONTACT_71640], which may include copi[INVESTIGATOR_123321], core lab results and independent reviewer 
information  as available for the above listed events .  For purposes of determining inclusion 
into the primary safety endpoint, the CEC will adjudicate all the above listed events as to their level of seriousness and relation to the ablation procedure and/or catheter. The death 
classification system that will be used by [CONTACT_850525] s developed using the NASPE policy36, 
as well as definitions from Epstein et al. (1 5)  and O'Connor et al. (16 ).    All  supporting source 
documentation provided by [CONTACT_850526].  
 Data Moni toring Committee  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is responsible for the oversight review of all AEs. The DMC will include leading experts in Electrophysiology and Biostatistics who are not participating in the study and who have no affiliation with BSC.  During the course of the 
study, the DMC will review accumulating safety data to monitor the incidence of AEs sent to the CEC and other trends that would warrant modification or termination of the study. Responsibilities, qualifications, membership, and DMC procedures will be included in the DMC Charter.  
Any DMC recommendation for study modification or termination because of concerns over subject safety or issues relating to data monitoring or quality control will be submitted in writing to BSC and the study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_850437].

whether ablation is performed after failure of antiarrhythmic drug therapy or as first-line therapy is shown. 
 Quality of Life Instruments  
Clinical trials increasingly recognize the value of including patient reported outcome measures in their design. To understand the impact of atrial fibrillation ablation procedures on patient’s quality of life, the quality of life instruments used for the trial will be the EQ -5D-
5L for a generic questionnaire and the AFEQT for disease specific. Subjects will be asked to complete the questionnaires at the Enrollment visit as well as at the three, six, and 12- month follow-ups.   
The EQ -5D, generic quality of life measure, will be used to assess health utilities. It is a 
descriptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions 
(mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can 
take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no problems/slight 
problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ -5D 
dimension.

   Confidential       FROzEN -AF study protocol, document 92348334, Rev  I 
 Page [ADDRESS_1182310] on Quality of Life (AFEQT) was developed to evaluate disease -
specific quality of life for patients with atrial fibr illation. The 20- item questionnaire is 
subdivided into three domains: symptoms, daily activities, and treatment concerns with 
responses provided on a seven- point Likert scale.  
 National Institutes of Health Stroke Assessment  
The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is an assessment tool which quantifies stroke related neurological deficit.  This assessment must be conducted in person to provide valuable information on stroke severity.   
An Investigator or appropriately trained and delegat ed site staff designee will administer NIH 
Stroke Scale assessment prior to the index ablation procedure (Baseline) and again at the pre-
discharge visit ([ADDRESS_1182311] the ablation procedure).  All individuals conducting the 
assessment will be required to become certified on administration of the assessment and provide BSC with documentation of certification prior to assessment completion with subjects.    
Investigational sites will be provided w ith instructions for assessment completion for the test.  
They will be instructed to administer stroke scale items in the order listed on the form.  
Scores should reflect what the subject does, not what the clinician thinks the subject can do. The clinicia n should record answers while administering the exam and work quickly.  Except 
where indicated, the subject should not be coached.  If a worsening score is noted from the previous assessment, the Investigator must follow the additional requirements defined throughout Section 12.7.  
 CHA 2DS 2-VASc Score for AF  
The CHA2DS2 -VASc score is used for risk stratification of ischemic stroke in patients with 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

Control Device and 
device sizes, if applicable  There are no control devices in this extension study.  
Study Design  Multi -center, open label, prospective, single arm study to document the 
safety and performance of [LOCATION_011] Scientific’s Cryoablation System with the POLARx FIT  catheter  models.  
All subjects fitting the enrollment criteria, signing the consent and undergoing the index procedure with the study devices will be followed up for twelve  months after the index procedure.  
Due to the similarities between  the POLARx and POLARx FIT 
catheters, the safety and effectiveness data from subjects treated with POLARx (“FROZEN- AF subjects”) may  be pooled with the safety and 
effectiveness data from subjects treated with POLARx FIT catheter models (“POLARx FIT subjects”) . The data will be  submitted for 
product approvals once 3 months of follow-up data is available for POLARx FIT subjects. 
Planned Number of Subjects  A maximum of  75 subjects will be enrolled and treated with the 
POLARx FIT balloon size at 31 or 28 mm (based on clinical judgement) to achieve 50 subjects in the 31 mm TREATMENT group (subjects who  receive at least one cryoablation applied at  the 31 mm 
configuration). 
Planned Number of Investigational Sites / Countries  Up to [ADDRESS_1182322]- procedure.

• Subjects who in the judgment of the investigator have a life 
expectancy of less than two years  
*LVEF and LA diameters obtained ≤180 days prior to enrollment will be 
acceptable,  unless a cardiac event has occurred (e.g. MI) between the date of the 
exam and the enrollment date, otherwise a new echocardiogram (trans -thoracic  
or trans -esophageal, or intracardiac echo) must be performed to confirm 
eligibility prior to performing ablation. For TTE, LA anteroposterior diameter measured by M -mode from the parasternal long- axis view will be used.  If both 
LA diameter and volume are  available, only one meeting eligibility criteria is 
required.  
 **The absence of thrombus must be confirmed by [CONTACT_3553] a trans -esophageal 
echocardiogram (TEE) within 48 hours prior to the procedure or Intracardiac Echography (ICE) during the procedure in subjects not adequately anticoagulated (see Section  12.5.2 ) for at least 3 weeks prior to procedure OR 
with CHA
2DS 2-VASc score (see Appendix 27 .4) ≥2 in men and ≥3 in women OR 
enlarged LA (≥4.5cm). If a thrombus is observed, the subject no longer meets 
eligibility criteria. When screening for thrombus prior to the index procedure, 
ensure that the anticoagulation approach as described in S ection 12.5.2  is 
followed until the day of the procedure.  
Arrhythmia 
Monitoring Strategy This study will employ a rhythm surveillance monitoring strategy 
consistent with the recommendations in the 2017 HRS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation. A  
wearable arrhythmia/event monitor (e.g. Trans-Telephonic Monitor- TTM) will be used to assess atrial arrhythmia recurrence (including unscheduled visits for symptomatic atrial arrhythmias and 24-hour Holter monitoring at 12 months follow up).  
Subjects will be instructed to transmit all symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_850444].  A t least two transmissions 
every month are to be made. 
All TREATMENT subjects will be provided with 24-Hour Holter 
Monitors at the 12-month follow-up vi sit.   
Core lab will be utilized for reviewing electrocardiographic recordings from the surveillance monitoring, inclusive of data from the wearable arrhythmia/event monitors and in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850366].

  6. Introduction  
6.1. Background 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly encountered sustained cardiac arrhythmia in 
clinical practice (2). In the [LOCATION_002], the incidence of atrial fibrillation is estimated to increase from an estimated 2.66 million people in 2010 to as many as 12 million people by 2050 (3). It currently affects approximately 2.3 million people in North America (4).  In addition, the prevalence and incidence of AF are increasing over time due to the aging of the population and a substantial increase in the age-s pecific occurrence of AF (5,6,7).  Among Medicare beneficiaries, 
incident AF is common and increases as individuals age with incidence rates per 1,000 person-years reported at ages 70 -74 of 18.8, increasing to 28.8 for persons 75-79 and 38.3 for persons 
80-84. Similarly, the overall prevalence among Medicare beneficiaries age 70 -74 is about 6% 
increasing to over 13% for individuals 80 years of age and older (8).   
AF causes symptoms that impair quality of life, increases the risk of stroke fivefold, and increases mortality.  
There are multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_850372]; however, it is recognized that many of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_850373]. Treatment options include medical management, pacing, cardioversion, implantable devices, surgery, and ablation therapy to eliminate the arrhythmia (9,10 ,11).  It has been increasingly recognized that focal pulmonary 
vein (PV) triggers of AF can account for 80 to 95 percent of paroxysmal cases that are drug resistant.  As outlined in  the 2017 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) consensus document, electrical 
isolation of the pulmonary veins is now recognized as the cornerstone of AF ablation. At most centers where AF ablation is performed, a strategy of creating a series of point -by-point 
radiofrequency lesions that encircle the PVs is used.  
Although great progress has been made in improving the techniques and outcomes of AF catheter ablation, many challenges remain. Two of the current limitations of atrial fibrillation ablation include the use of catheters designed for pi[INVESTIGATOR_850374]- area ablations 
in a point-by-point fashion and the dexterity required to perform such a lesion set.   
A cryoballoon system for treatment of AF is comprised of components that deliver cryogenic 
refrigerant in a controlled fashion, from a reservoir located in a console through a conduit accessory and into a treatment catheter. The treatment catheter has a balloon at its distal end that is delivered to a target location within the patient’s heart. O nce the balloon is positioned in the 
antrum of the target PV, refrigerant is delivered to the balloon to extract heat from tissue in contact [CONTACT_792914].  By [CONTACT_850533], a PV may be isolated  with a single 3 to 4‐ minute application of cryo‐ energy.  
Two studies have been completed with the currently approved cryoablation technology (Arctic 
Front™/ Arctic Front Advance™ Cryoablation Balloon, Medtronic
®) demonstrating effective 
therapy for PAF ma nagement with approximately 70% and 65% efficacy respectively (12,13).  
In addition to these efficacy and safety results, the simplicity of the procedure and the ability for average skilled interventionalists to match the results of elite RF operators prov ides cardiologists

 Page [ADDRESS_1182351] ‐growing patient numbers. Balloon catheter cryoablation 
therapy to treat Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) has gained significant utilization 
worldwide. 
Catheter and sheath performance for cryoablation balloon procedures has not changed since 
inception, more than ten years ago. Knowing that electrophysiologists are familiar with treating 
AF with cryo ‐therapy, the [LOCATION_011] Scientific Cardiac Cryoablation System was designed with a 
clinical user focus and set out to improve the user experience. This was accomplished by 
[CONTACT_850534], improving sheath maneuverability and incorporating general s afety/ workflow improvements over current technology. 
Extensive pre ‐clinical and performance bench testing studies have been performed to date. A 
first-in-man clinical study with the POLARx cryoablation system  was completed in 2018 and the 
system  obtained CE -mark  in 2020. The POLARx cryoablation system is currently commercially 
available in Europe / Middle East, Australia / New Zealand, Japan , and other select countries.  
Good occlusion of the pulmonary vein and intimate contact [CONTACT_850535].  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_850445] 28 mm diameter cryoballoon  (both POLARx 
and Arctic Front Advance balloons are 28 mm), physicians have consistently communi cated a 
desire for a larger diameter balloon  to improve occlusion in a variety of clinical scenarios (15 , 
16).  BSC has developed POLARx FIT which gives users the capability to increase the balloon 
diameter of POLARx  from 28 mm to 31 mm on demand. The FIT feature is available on 
POLARx FIT catheter models. This additional capability has been developed without any 
physical changes to the POLARx catheter or SMARTFREEZE console and without sacrificing 
existing  capabilities of the POLARx Cryoablation System stu died in FROzEN- AF.   
6.2. Study Rationale  
The data of up to 75 subjects who will undergo treatment with the [LOCATION_011] Scientific 
Cryoablation System for de-novo PAF will be evaluated in this extension study of FROzEN- AF.  
This extension study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, investigation being conducted to establish the safety and effectiveness of [LOCATION_011] Scientific’s POLARx Cryoablation System with the POLARx FIT catheter models in subjects with symptomatic, drug refractory, recurrent, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The aim of the trial is to collect data  with the POLARx 
Cryoablation System using the POLARx FIT  catheter  models with treatment applied at 28 mm or 
31 mm balloon size per physician discretion. This study seeks to obtain approval for the [LOCATION_011] Scientific Cryoablation System with the POLAR x FIT catheter models in North America.

  7.1.1. POLARx FIT Cryoablation Catheters 
The POLARx FIT Cryoablation Catheter s are additional models (Short Tip and Long Tip) of the 
POLARx cryoablation balloon catheters that are part of the POLARx cryoablation system  being 
investigated in this extension study.  
The POLARx FIT catheter  models are physically identical to the POLARx models (used in the 
FROzEN -AF study) and differ only in the model number programmed into the EEPROM (i.e. 
electronic identifier) of the catheter.  
Identical  to the POLARx  Cryoablation Catheter, the POLARx FIT catheter is  a single use, flexible, 
over-the- wire balloon catheter used to ablate cardiac tissue. The POLARx FIT catheter  is used in 
conjunction with the Console to induce thermal injury and endocardial tissue necrosis when the 
balloon is in contact [CONTACT_850536] e and reaches cryoablation temperatures created by a 
refrigerant injected from the Console into the balloon segment of the POLARx FIT. The 
Cryoablation catheter connects to the Console with a Cryoablation Cable (for N 2O delivery and 
removal) and an Extension Cable (for electrical connection via the Interconnection Box). The Cryoablation catheter is designed to be used with a Cryoablation Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850446].  
During an electrophysiology (EP) ablation procedure, the Cryoablation catheter (including the 
Cryoablation Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_54370]) is inserted through the Cryoablation Steerable Sheath into the 
venous system, directed into the left atrium (LA) and towards the ostium of the target pulmonary vein (PV). Once positioning that occludes the PV has been verified, refrigerant is delivered through the Cryoablation Cable to the injection coil, which directs the flow of refrigerant toward the interior 
distal surface of the balloon. This  results in a cooled region at the balloon tissue interface, which 
adheres to the endocardial surface. The low temperature and pressure gradient allows the balloon to thermally create transmural, circumferential tissue necrosis (lesions) and interrupt elec trical 
conduction.  
The Cryoablation Catheter is comprised of the following major components, distal to proximal:  
• Atraumatic tip  
• Double layer balloon system  
• Guide wire lumen  
• Internal balloon thermocouple  
• Injection coil and manifold for delivery of the refrigerant; liquid nitrous oxide (N
2O)  
• Catheter shaft; to retrieve the expanded N 2O gas  
• Catheter handle  
• Distal handle connections

7.1.4. SMARTFREEZE Cryoablation System Console 
The SMARTFREEZE Cryoablation System Console is a device that uses N 2O provided from a 
refillable cylinder to safely pressurize (inflate) and cool the Cryoablation Catheter to cryogenic ablative temperatures. The console houses the electrical and components and software/firmware needed to perform cryoablation procedures. It controls the delivery, recovery, and disposal of N
2O (cryoablation refrigerant) safely and efficiently. The Console user interface provides a 
means  for initiating and ceasing refrigerant delivery. Once the command is received from the 
console, N 2O is delivered as a chilled liquid to the Cryoablation Catheter for a programmable 
time duration.  The user interface also displays key information allowing the operator to focus attention on critical tasks and speed up the overall procedure.

Figure 5:  SMARTFREEZE Cryoablation System Console 
 
Integration between the Cryoablation Catheter and the Console includes monitoring catheter as well as console functionality, aided by a number of accessory devices that make up the overall system such as: power cords, extension cables, connection box, foot  switch, diaphragmatic 
movement sensor, esophageal temperature sensor cable. In addition, the system incorporates a number of non-medical device items such as a scavenging hose, wrench, and nitrous oxide tank.   
When connected to a SMARTFREEZE Cryoablation System  Console the new EEPROM number 
in the POLARx FIT catheter makes the “FIT” feature button available in the user interface. This 
feature lets users increase the balloon diameter from [ADDRESS_1182353] and larger diameter balloons (as demonstrated by [CONTACT_850537]). The balloon diameter will return to the standard [ADDRESS_1182354] diameter, 
the POLARx Cryoablation System is physically, functionally, and operationally identical to that currently used in the FROzEN-AF study.

  7.1.5. Diaphragm Movement Sensor  
This section identically matches the Diaphragm Movement Sensor Section (Section 5.1.5) of the 
FROzEN -AF protocol (92348334). 
The Diaphragm Movement Sensor (DMS)  is a patch device placed on the patient just below the 
costal cartilage on the right side and used to monitor a phrenic nerve pacing response. It is connected to the Inter Connection Box (ICB) sending data to be displayed on the user interface of the Console. By [CONTACT_850486], the user can be 
informed when the measured pacing response is lower than a pre -determined value set by [CONTACT_24201]. 
Phrenic nerve monitoring is a known and essential component in determining safety during a 
cryoablation procedure. The current standard -of-care technique which is used to monitor for 
phrenic nerve palsy is to have the physician place his/her hand on the patient’s chest and assess the patient’s diaphragmatic movement during the period within the procedure that requires the physician’s full attention (when ablation is occurring). 
It has been reported with cryoablation balloon technology that the incidence of phrenic nerve injury 
ranges from 2.7% - 11.2% of patients undergoing a cryoablation procedure. The physician 
subjectively decides when injury may be occurring based on the change in diaphragmatic movement during respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. The physician suspends ablation if there is a significant reduction in diaphragmatic movement. This is  a manual and physician dependent technique where the 
incidence of occurrence is related to experience in the cryoablation procedure.  
An accelerometer in the DMS detects any reduction of diaphragmatic movement indicating phrenic nerve impact, thus helpi[INVESTIGATOR_850383]. The DMS is connected to the ICB of the Cryoablation Console and 
sends data to be displayed on the Cryoablation Console’s user interface (see Figure 6).

Figure 6:  Diaphragm Movement Sensor (DMS) Data Cryoablation Console Display 
Phrenic Nerve Pacing Signal & Alert  
 
By [CONTACT_850487], the physician can be informed when the measured pacing response falls below a pre -set value. The pre- determined value is programmed by [CONTACT_24201]. The value is displayed as a percentage; with the first physical excursion es tablishing 
the baseline at 100%. The measurement display changes from “Blue” to “Red” if the value falls below the physician’s programmed pre- set value (see Figure 6 above).  
 The DMS is designed to be a used as an adjunct accessory to continually evaluate diaphragm movement during ablation; as a reminder alert to augment the established clinical practice described above for phrenic nerve assessment. The DMS is not a substitute for physician standard practice of phrenic nerve assessment during a cryoablation, i.e., physician palpation of the 
diaphragm, or attentive medical practice.  
7.1.6. Esophageal Temperature Sensor Cable  
Esophageal temperature monitoring is a frequently used technique; used more so when there is an anatomical concern related to the proximity of  the esophagus to the inferior pulmonary veins and 
posterior wall of the Left Atrium (LA). The incidence of esophageal ulceration is generally reversible, with a reported incidence of 17% of patients. 
As noted above, the ICB is designed to receive information from other proprietary devices such as 
an esophageal temperature probe. When connected, the esophageal temperature probe provides monitoring and alert data to the console for display. Esophageal temperature probes are widely available in stand -alone me asurement systems and used as such within the EP lab. The Esophageal 
Temperature Sensor Cable enables the connection of a commercially available 400 series 
temperature probe (for example, Truer Medical [ADDRESS_1182355] No. 81- 020409) to be connected to the Console. Multisensor

  probes and CIRCA  S-CATH™ esophageal temperature probe s are not compatible with the 
POLARx Cryoablation System and are therefore not permitted under this protocol.  
This feature integrates the detection of the esophageal temperature and provides a reminder alert 
to the physician if the esophageal temperature goes below a physician pre -set value. The measured 
esophageal temperature turns the measurement display from “Blue” to “Red” if the temperature probe falls below a physician pre -set value (see Figure 7 below). This feature potentially reduces  
adverse events such as esophageal ulcerations and fistulas. This is a redundant safety alert system 
to the measurement systems used today although the alert is now displayed on the Console.

event.  
Table 5:  Safety  Endpoint Components Definitions  
Term  Definition  
Atrioesophageal Fistula  An atrioesophageal fistula is defined as a connection between the atrium 
and the lumen of the esophagus. Evidence supporting this diagnosis 
includes documentation of esophageal erosion combined with evidence of 
a fistulous connection to the atrium, such as air emboli, an embolic event, or direct observation at the time of surgical repair. A CT scan or MRI scan is the most common method of documentation of an atrioesophageal  
fistula.  
AV block  A conduction disturbance that results in the partial inability of an electrical 
impulse generated in the atria to reach the ventricles.  
Cardiac tamponade/perforation  Cardiac tamponade/perforation is defined as the development of a 
significant pe ricardial effusion during or within 30 days of undergoing an 
AF ablation procedure. A significant pericardial effusion is one that results in hemodynamic compromise, requires elective or urgent pericardiocentesis, or results in a 1 -cm or more pericardial e ffusion as 
documented by [CONTACT_51541].  
Myocardial infarction (in  
the context of AF  
ablation)  The presence of any one of the following criteria:  
(1) detection of ECG changes indicative of new ischemia (new STT wave changes or new left bundle branch block, LBBB) that persist for more than 1 hour;  
(2) development of new pathological Q waves on an ECG;  
(3) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional 
wall motion abnormality.  
Pericardial Effusion  A collection of fluid or blood in  the pericardial space around the heart or in 
pleural space around the lungs.  
Phrenic nerve palsy  Phrenic nerve palsy is defined as absent phrenic nerve function as assessed 
by a sniff test. A phrenic nerve palsy is considered to be permanent when it 
is documented to be present [ADDRESS_1182360] cavity.  
Pulmonary edema/heart failure  Ineffective pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_850392]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_850393], difficulty breathing when lying flat and leg or ankle swelling.  
Pulmonary Vein Stenosis (Severe)  Pulmonary vein stenosis is defined as a reduction of the diameter of a PV 
or PV branch. PV stenosis can be categorized as mild <50%, moderate 50%–70%, and severe ≥70% reduction in the diameter of the PV or PV 
branch. A severe PV stenosis will count toward the primary safety endpoint.

  Term  Definition  
Stroke/Cerebrovascular accident 
(CVA)  Stroke diagnostic criteria:  
• Rapid onset of a focal or global neurological deficit with at least 
one of the following: change in level of consciousness, hemiplegia, hemiparesis, numbness or sensory loss affecting one side of the body, dysphasia or aphasia, hemianopia, amaurosis fugax, or other neurological signs or symptoms consistent with strok e. 
• Duration of a focal or global neurological deficit ≥ 24 hours; OR 
<24 hours if therapeutic intervention(s) were performed (e.g., thrombolytic therapy or intracranial angioplasty); OR available neuroimaging documents a new hemorrhage or infarct; OR the neurological deficit results in death.  
• No other readily identifiable non- stroke cause for the clinical 
presentation (e.g., brain tumor, trauma, infection, hypoglycemia, peripheral lesion, pharmacological influences).  
• Confirmation of the diagnosis by [CONTACT_469151]: 
neurology or neurosurgical specialist; neuroimaging procedure (MRI or CT scan or cerebral angiography); lumbar puncture (i.e., 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_850456])
  
• Stroke: (diagnosis as above, preferably with positive 
neuroimaging study);  
o Minor –Modified Rankin score <2 at 30 and 90 days†  
o Major –Modified Rankin score ≥[ADDRESS_1182361] migrated from another 
anatomic site.  
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)  New focal neurological deficit with rapid symptom resolution (usually 1 to 
2 hours), always within 24 hours; neuroimaging without tissue injury. 
Transient ischemic att ack: new focal neurological deficit with rapid 
symptom resolution (usually 1 to 2 hours), always within 24 hours; 
neuroimaging without tissue injury  
Vagal Nerve 
Injury/Gastroparesis * Vagal nerve injury is defined as injury to the vagal nerve that results in 
esophageal dysmotility or gastroparesis.  Vagal nerve injury is considered to be a major complication if it prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or results in ongoing symptoms for more than 30 days 
following an ablation procedure.  
Vascu lar access complications * Vascular access complications include the development of a hematoma, an 
AV fistula, or a pseudoaneurysm. A major vascular complication is defined as one that requires intervention, such as surgical repair or transfusion, prolongs the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], or requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].   
 
*Events of v ascular access complications and gastroparesis/ injury to vagus nerve will only be considered 
primary safety endpoint events if they meet the criteria for a major complication, per protocol  Table 5 . Non -
major events of this type will not be considered primary safety endpoint events. This is consistent with the methods used in the meta -analysis performed to determine expected rates and an appropriate performance 
goal for the primary safety endpoint (Section 8.2).

9. Study Design  
This extension study of FROzEN- AF is a prospective, non-randomized, multi- center, 
investigation being conducted to establish the safety and effectiveness of [LOCATION_011] Scientific’s 
POLARx Cryoablation System with the POLARx FIT catheter models in subjects with 
symptomatic, drug refractory, recurrent, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  
9.1. Scale and Duration 
A maximum of [ADDRESS_1182374] enrollment will stop once 50 evaluable  
31 mm TREATMENT subjects are accrued  (per s ubject status classification,  Section  11.5).   
Up to [ADDRESS_1182375]  
will be followed at specified time points after the ablation procedure (index procedure), with a 
follow-up duration of [ADDRESS_1182376]’s participation will be considered complete when all protocol required visits have been completed as indicated in Figure 8.  The total sub-study duration is estimated to be approximately [ADDRESS_1182377]-approval requirements.

  9.2. Treatment Assignment  
All screened subjects who sign the informed consent will be considered enrolled.  Data will be 
collected during the baseline visit, the ablation (index) procedure, the pre-discharge visit, the 
Day [ADDRESS_1182378]/follow up, month [ADDRESS_1182379] Status and Classification as per S ection 11.5. 
9.2.1. Treatment  
All enrolled subjects who undergo the ablation procedure will be treated with [LOCATION_011] Scientific’s POLARx Cryoablation System (with the POLARx FIT catheter models as Cryoablation catheters ). The physician will apply treatment at [ADDRESS_1182380] follow -up visits if 
appropriately delegated ( Section 12.6.1) and trained to complete the assigned tasks.   
9.3. Justification for the Study Design  
9.3.1. Extension Study  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific proposes a prospective non- randomized IDE extension study with the 
POLAR x Cryoablation System (and  the POLARx FIT catheter models  as Cryoablation catheters) 
as treatment device in order to seek approval of the POLAR x Cryoablation System. The rationale 
for a non-randomized extension study can be justified as follows:  
• All aspects of usage, including preparation, introduction, occlusion and ablation with the POLARx FIT catheters are identical to POLARx Cryoablation System. The  POLARx 
FIT cat heter  models  are physically identical to POLARx models and differ only in the 
model number programmed into the EEPROM (i.e., electronic identifier) of the catheter.  
When connected to a SMARTFREEZE Cryoablation Console the new EEPROM number makes the “FIT” feature available. This feature gives users the ability to increase the balloon diameter from [ADDRESS_1182381] the desired balloon size per treatment. The POLARx FIT 
catheter model  leverages the materials and manufacturing assembly processes as the 
POLARx catheter.

 Page 55 of 126 
 
  • The POLARx FIT catheter models  and POLAR x catheters are intended to be used in the 
same patient population. BSC’s POLARx FIT capability gives users both the standard 28 
mm balloon and an option to increase to a larger, 31 mm balloon on demand. The added choice of a 31 mm balloon size for the POLARx FIT Catheter will allow physicians to provide cryoablation for PV isolation in a larger variety of pulmonary vein geometries (i.e., those that might not have been as good a fit using a 28 mm balloon size).  
• The POLARx FIT catheter models  and POLARx catheters have been tested to ensure that 
both balloon diameters provide the same therapeutic cooling . This was tested in a bench 
model that allowed measurement and comparison of the balloon surface temperature of 
the POLARx FIT catheter models and POLARx catheters . The comparison study showed 
no statistical difference in the average surface temperature between POLARx FIT at 31 mm ball oon diameter and POLARx at 28 mm.  
• The POLARx FIT catheter models  and POLARx catheters are introduced into the body 
the same way and have the same mechanism of deployment -inflation via low pressure 
N2O refrigerant , with the only difference being the pressure and flow rate applied by [CONTACT_850539] . By [CONTACT_850540] 28 mm and 31 mm diameter s, the safety and 
effectiveness of POLARx FIT to alter cardiac tissue is not expected to differ.   
Due to the similarities  between  the POLARx and POLARx FIT catheters, the safety and 
effectiveness data from subjects treated with POLARx ( “FROZEN -AF subjects ”) may be pooled 
with the safety and effectiveness data from subjects treated with POLARx FIT catheter models (“POLARx FIT subjects” ). The data will be  submitted for product approvals once [ADDRESS_1182382] of individual center bias, e ach site participating in the extension study will 
enroll and treat a maximum of 18 subjects with cryoablation applied at the 31 mm configuration.

  during the time of the study (method of assessment upon physician’s 
discretion) 
 
• Subjects who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or 
registry that would directly interfere with the current study, except when the subject is participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry with no associated treatments; each insta nce must be brought to the attention of the 
sponsor to determine eligibility  
 
• Subjects who in the judgment of the investigator have a life 
expectancy of less than two years  
 
*LVEF and LA diameters obtained ≤180 days prior to enrollment will be acceptable,  
unless a cardiac event has occurred ( e.g., MI) between the date of the exam and the 
enrollment date, otherwise a new echocardiogram (trans -thoracic or trans -
esophageal, or intracardiac echo) must be performed to confirm eligibility prior to 
performing ablation. For TTE, the LA anteroposterior diameter measured by M -mode 
from the parasternal long- axis view will be used.  If both LA diameter and volume are 
available, only one meeting eligibility criteria is required.  
 
**The absence of thrombus must be confirmed by [CONTACT_3553] a TEE within 48 hours prior to the procedure or ICE during procedure in subjects not adequately 
anticoagulated (see Section 12.5.2 ) for at least 3 we eks prior to the procedure OR 
with CHA
2DS 2-VASc score (see Appendix 27 .4) ≥2 in men and  ≥3 in women OR 
enlarged LA (≥4.5cm). If a thrombus is observed, the subject no longer meets 
eligibility criteria. When screening for thrombus prior to the index procedure, ensure that the anticoagulation approach as described in Section 12.5.[ADDRESS_1182384] Accountability  
11.1. Point of Enrollment  
A maximum of 75 subjects will be enrolled and treated with the POLARx FIT balloon size at 31 
or 28 mm (based on clinical judgement) to ensure a minimum of 50 31 mm TREATMENT 
subjects (subjects who receive at least one cryoablation applied at the 31 mm configuration.) are enrolled. 
Subjects who have signed and dated the Informed Consent Form are considered enrolled in the 
study.  No study- related activities, testing, procedures, etc. can take place until the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) is signed and dated by [CONTACT_423]. Screening tests that are part of SOC can be used to determine pre-eligibility. Study data from exams performed prior to consent/enrollment (e.g., TTE) will be collected as medical history data after the subject is

  consented/enrolle d in the study.  It is the investigator’s site responsibility to assess eligibility 
criteria before obtaining the Informed Consent Form. 
11.2. Enrollment Controls  
Study- specific subject IDs will be generated through the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system 
used for this study. This database will also be utilized to provide the sites with subject 
classification assignments once a subject has provided written informed consent.  E nrollment 
controls will be put in place to ensure that e ach site participating in the extension study will 
enroll and treat a maximum of 18 subjects  with cryoablation applied at the 31 mm configuration. 
11.3. Withdrawals 
This section identically matches the Withdrawals Section ( Section 9.3) of the FROzEN -AF 
protocol (92348334). 
All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical study) 
shall be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the clinical investigation, the reason(s) shall be rep orted. If such withdrawal is due to problems related to investigational 
device safety or performance, the investigator shall ask for the subject’s documented permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical study.   
Reasons for withdrawal may include physician discretion, subject choice to withdraw, lost to 
follow-up, or death. While study withdrawal is discouraged, subjects may withdraw from the study at any time, with or without reason, and without prejudice to further treatment. In t he event 
a subject does decide to withdraw from the study, every effort should be made to obtain full information on any on-going reportable Adverse Events up to the point of withdrawal.  Additional data may no longer be collected after the point at which a subject has been withdrawn from the study or withdraws his/her consent, for whatever reason. Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal may be used, unless any local regulations apply which require removal of the data.  
If the withdrawal is due to the investigator’s discretion, the investigator is obligated to follow all open reportable Adverse Events until they can be considered as closed or chronic. 
All open reportable adverse events should be closed or documented as chronic.  If the withdrawa l 
is due to problems related to device safety or performance, the investigator shall ask for the 
subject’s documented permission to follow his/her status/condition. 
Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. All applicable electronic case report forms (eCRFs) up to the point of subject withdrawal/lost to 
follow up and an “End of Study” eCRF must be completed.

 Page [ADDRESS_1182385] to Follow-Up Section ( Section 9.4) of the FROzEN -AF 
protocol (92348334). 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return after documented 
attempts to attend a scheduled visit and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_136589].  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_850541]/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (at minimum 3 telephone calls and a certified le tter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). 
These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be consider ed lost to 
follow-up from the study. 
 All applicable electronic case report forms (eCRFs) up to the point of subject withdrawal/lost to follow up and an “End of Study” eCRF must be completed.   
11.5. Subject Status and Classification  
As subjects are evaluated, enrolled and treated in the study, they will be grouped into one of the following categories. Categorization will help determine how data gathered from them will be stored and evaluated. Subjects previously enrolled in the FROZEN -AF study cannot be re -enrol led 
in the POLAR x FIT extension study.  
Consent Ineligible (Screening Failures)  
A subject who has signed informed consent but is found not to meet eligibility criteria will be classified as “Consent Ineligible”. There are no Follow Up reporting requirements for consent ineligible subjects. Subjects determined to be Consent Ineligible do not count towards the enrollment ceiling and will not be used for analysis of the endpoints. The original signed Informed Consent must be maintained in the center’s patient file.   A subject Identification Number (ID) will be assigned in the EDC system.  
For consent ineligible subjects the following forms must be completed: 
• Enrollment and End of Study  
• Adverse Event forms for any reportable event, as defined in Section [ADDRESS_1182386] withdrawal

investigational devices inserted into the body will be classified as “INTENT”. Subjects that are enrolled in the study but do not undergo ablation procedure within [ADDRESS_1182388] not be reconsented and will be withdrawn from the study and classified as “INTENT”. 
These subjects won’t be allowed to be re-enrolled in the study. 
There are no follow up requirements for Intent subjects. Intent subjects will not count towards the 
enrollment ceiling and will not be used for analysis of the endpoints. The original signed Informed 
Consent must be maintained in the center’s patient file. A subject ID will be assigned in the EDC 
system.  
• For intent subjects, at the miniumum the following  forms must be completed: Enrollment 
and baseline forms such as, but not limited to, informed consent, enrollment information 
and other related forms  
• End of Study form 
• Adverse Event forms for any reportable event, as defined in Section 21, that occurs after 
signing the Informed Consent, up to the point of subject withdrawal 
ATTEMPT 
A subject who signs informed consent, meets eligibility criteria, and has any study device inserted 
into the body but does not receive any POLARx FIT Cryoablation application will be classified as “ATTEMPT.” Attempt subjects do not count towards the enroll ment ceiling. Attempt subjects will 
be used for analysis of the primary and secondary safety endpoint and additional analyses of safety data but will not be used for analysis of the primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints or additional analyses of effectiveness data (additional analysis include subgroup, multivariable, and center pooling analyses). The original signed Informed Consent must be maintained in the center’s patient file. A subject ID will be assigned in the EDC system. These subjects won’t be allowed to be re-enrolled in the study.
 
Attempt subjects will be followed through the [ADDRESS_1182389] be maint ained in the center’s patient file.  
TREATMENT 
Any subject that signs the consent form, meets eligibility criteria and has the specified study device 
inserted into the body and received at least one POLAR x FIT Cryoablation application, regardless  
of the balloon size configuration, will be classified as “TREATMENT”. These subjects are 
followed in accordance with the follow-up schedule and included in all study analyses.  A subject ID will be assigned in the EDC system. For TREATMENT subjects, all applicable case report forms per the protocol will be completed. TREATMENT subjects do count towards the [ADDRESS_1182390] be maintained in the center’s patient file.

  12.2. Study Candidate Screening  
Investigators are responsible for screening all subjects and selecting those who are appropriate for 
study inclusion. The subjects selected for participation should be from the investigator’s general patient population.  The investigator is expected to follow standard of care testing to diagnose and screen subjects for inclusion in the study. 
12.3. Enrollment and Informed Consent 
This section identically matches the E nrollment and Informed Consent Section (Section 1 0.3) of 
the FROzEN -AF protocol (92348334). 
Subjects who provide consent are considered enrolled in the study. To  determine eligibility of a 
subject, the investigator or designee needs to implement the consent process and verify/document the subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Informed consent is required for all subjects prior to their participation in the study. No study-specific procedures should be conducted prior to consent.  
The subject should be given ample time to consider participation and ask questions if necessary. 
An approved informed consent form (ICF) shall be personally signed and dated by [CONTACT_423]. The original, signed document is to be kept with the subject’s file and a copy must be provided to the subject.  The index procedure must be performed within [ADDRESS_1182398] will be classified as Intent (see Section 11.5).  The Intent subject cannot be considered for re -enrollment as re -
enrollment is not allowed for any subjects in this study. The site will ensure that originally signed ICFs and documentation of the ICF signature [CONTACT_850560]’ files and that the subject’s partici pation into the study is documented per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850459] (e.g., in the medical file). 
Originally signed ICFs and the ICF process will be made available for review at Interim Monitoring Visits (IMVs).  
For additional information regarding the informed consent process, refer to Section 22. 
12.4. Baseline Visit  
This section identically matches the Baseline Visit Section ( Section 1 0.4) of the FROzEN -AF

* LVEF and LA diameters obtained ≤ 180 days prior to enrollment will be acceptable, unless a 
cardiac event has occurred ( e.g., MI) between the date of the exam and the enrollment date, 
otherwise a new echocardiogram (trans -thoracic or trans -esophageal, or intracardiac echo) must 
be performed to confirm eligibility prior to performing ablation. LA anteroposterior diameter measured  by M- mode from the parasternal long -axis view will be used.  If both LA diameter and 
volume are available, only one meeting eligibility criteria is required.  
**Moderate to Severe mitral stenosis (severity will be assessed as pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 30 mmHg). 
***A pregnancy test (method of assessment per investigators’ discretion) must be performed for women of childbearing potential. Women of childbearing  potential will be required to verify 
entrance criteria prior to the procedure by [CONTACT_382936] a negative pregnancy test.  A negative pregnancy test conducted as standard of care within 7 days prior to enrollment  will be 
acceptable.  
****Laboratory blood tests (other than a pregnancy blood test) obtained ≤ 90 days prior to enrollm ent will be acceptable.  
12.5. Medications 
This section identically matches the Medications Section ( Section 1 0.5) of the FROzEN -AF 
protocol (92348334). 
12.5.1. Anti -Arrhythmic Drugs  
[IP_ADDRESS]. AADs prior to index procedure 
Inclusion criteria require the subject to be refractory or intolerant to at least one class I or III 
antiarrhythmic medication and amiodarone to be stopped three months before enrollment.  Prior and current AAD therapy will be collected in the EDC system.
 
If applicable, administration of amiodarone and stop date  will be entered in EDC.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. AADs post index procedure during the 90-day blanking period 
Blanking period is defined as the time between Index procedure and [ADDRESS_1182400]- procedure AADs are allowed per physician’s discretion during the blanking period. New 
AADs should not be prescribed unless considered medically necessary.  If treatment with AAD is 
prescribed during the blanking period, it is recommended that a Class I or III AAD be selected according to the ACC/AHA/ESC [ADDRESS_1182401] for early arrhythmia recurrence that may require a repeat ablation procedure within the blanking period (on or before day 90).

  [IP_ADDRESS]. AADs post [ADDRESS_1182402] be prescribed any dose of AAD* for 
treatment of any atrial tachyarrhythmia after the blanking period, the subject will be considered a Primary Effectiveness Failure.   
*AADs for endpoint will consist of all Class I/III and any Class II/IV medications taken for control of AF/AT/AFL recurrence.    
Treatment with Class II/IV medications for conditions other than control of atrial arrhythmia recurrence is also permitted and will be documented.  Every effort should be made to keep those drugs at a stable dose over the entire course of the study.   
12.5.2. Anticoagulation 
The following anticoagulation protocol is required for this study. An adequate anticoagulation 
regimen  is represented by [CONTACT_444035] 4 approaches listed in the paragraph titled “Pre- ablation ”.
 
Pre-ablation. 
Physicians can follow either an uninterrupted anticoagulation approach (Recommended), based 
on uninterrupted warfarin or NOAC, or minimally interrupted NOAC or an interrupted anticoagulation approach with adequate bridge with LMWH (Low Mol ecular Weight Heparin).  
• Uninterrupted anticoagulation approach (recommended) includes one of the following options: 
1) Uninterrupted treatment with warfarin or NOAC*, requiring continued treatment including the day of the index procedure  
2) Minimally interrupted NOAC, requiring continued treatment but allowing to stop NOAC 12 to 24 hours before the index procedure ( e.g., hol ding the morning dose 
the day of the procedure) 
• Interrupted anticoagulation approach includes one of the following options. 
3) If patient is on Warfarin, this should be stopped [ADDRESS_1182403] opped 12 hours prior ablation. 
4) If patient is on NOAC, this should be stopped 5 days prior to the ablation procedure and bridged to Warfarin or bridged with LMWH. LMWH should be stopped 12 hours prior ablation. At the time NOAC is stopped, INR value should be checked, if applicable, to ensure the Time of Therapeutic Range (TTR) are achieved with normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0.  
* Includes any of the FDA approved NOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban, api[INVESTIGATOR_470953])  Anticoagulation guidelines that pertain to cardioversion of AF should be adhered.  
If at the time of enrollment, a patient has not been anticoagulated as defined above in the pre -
ablation anticoagulation, anticoagulation must be initiated and maintained from point of 
enrollment to th e time of the index procedure. If the patient has not been anticoagulated for at least

 FROzEN -AF Extension Study , 92797269  
 Rev/Ver  A 
 Page [ADDRESS_1182404] be conducted as outlined in Section 
12.5.3.  
 Intra ablation:  
• Heparin should be administered prior to transseptal puncture during AF catheter ablation 
procedures and adjusted to achieve and maintain an ACT of at least [ADDRESS_1182405] level should be checked at 10 to 15 -minute  intervals until therapeutic anticoagulation is 
achieved, and then at 15 to 30- minute  intervals for the duration of the procedure.  
After ablation:  
• Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a NOAC is recommended for at least [ADDRESS_1182406] cat heter ablation of AF.  
• Adherence to AF anticoagulation guidelines is recommended for patients who have undergone an AF ablation procedure, regardless of the apparent success or failure of the procedure.  
Decisions regarding continuation of systemic anticoagulation more than [ADDRESS_1182407] ablation should be based on the patient's stroke risk profile and not on the perceived success or failure of the ablation procedure. 
 
12.5.3. Thrombus Screening  
The absence of thrombus must be confirmed by [CONTACT_3553] a TEE within 48 hours prior to the 
procedure or ICE during the procedure in subjects not adequately anticoagulated (see section 10.5.2) for at least 3 weeks prior to procedure OR with CHA
2DS2-VASc score (see Appendix 
27.4) ≥2 in men and ≥3 in women OR enlarged LA (≥4.5cm) . When screening for thrombus prior 
to the index procedure, ensure that the anticoagulation approach as described in Section 12.5.2 is followed until the day of the procedure.  
12.6. Index (Ablation) Procedure 
12.6.1. General Info  
• Authorized ablating physicians 
 
The study- related ablation procedure, from transseptal access in the left atrium until end of the 
ablation procedure must be performed by [CONTACT_850497] (EP), trained to the POLARx FIT extension study protocol, and authorized by [CONTACT_850498]. The index ablation procedure must be performed within [ADDRESS_1182408]’s enrollment into the study.  To avoid potential bias, it is recommended the number of

  active ablating physicians performing the index procedure per investigational site is restricted 
to 2.  
 
• De novo procedures 
For the purposes of this protocol, de novo procedures are defined as AF procedures in which there has been no prior ablation in the Left Atrium (LA). According to subject selection crite ria, 
all Index procedures in this study are de -novo as history of previous left atrial ablation or 
surgical treatment for AF/ AFL/ AT constitute an exclusion criterion.  
• Esophagus management  
Esophagus management must be performed by [CONTACT_850542]. A commercially available temperature probe compatible with the Cryoablation system, will be used with measurements acquired and displayed through the Console. Only t emperature m easurements dis played on the C onsole will 
be used for esophageal temperature management. If the esophageal temperature falls below 
20°C during cryoablation applications, the ablation will be stopped until esophageal temperature returns to baseline.  
• Phrenic nerve activity  monitoring 
o Index Procedure:  
 During ablation phrenic nerve activity monitoring will be performed via the 
Console . The phrenic nerve will be paced with a focal or circular catheter, 
higher than the ablation position during all right sided vein ablations. If a reduction in phrenic response is detected, the operating physician will continue to closely monitor phrenic nerve activity and pacing capture, and will consider immediately interrupting cryoablation  
 After ablation, prior to leaving the EP lab, fluoroscopy of diaphragm movement will be performed at the completion of the ablation procedure 
o Discharge:  
 All patients presenting with phrenic nerve palsy at the end of the index procedure will be re- assessed at the discharge visit for phrenic nerve palsy 
via sniff test or an inhalation- exhalation chest radiography of the diaphragm  
o At Follow -up Visits: 
 Patients with unreso lved phrenic nerve palsy detected at discharge visit, 
should be assessed by [CONTACT_850500] - exhalation chest 
radiography of the diaphragm to evaluate if the event resolved

a commercially available device will be used, and the following information will be collected: 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_169228], 3D mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850401]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].Pulmonary Vein Isolation  
The goal of the ablation procedure is electrical isolation of all clinically relevant PVs.  Electrical isolation of the veins must be demonstrated by [CONTACT_850490].  
If the subject is in AF prior to the ablation, it will be up to the physician’s discretion whether to 
cardiovert or proceed with the procedure with the subject in AF.  Electrocardiographic documentation of the subject’s rhythm prior to ablation will be collected.  
[IP_ADDRESS].Cryoablation System Preparation  
The individual devices listed in Table [ADDRESS_1182409] be used together and  it is not allowed to combine 
investigational with non-investigational devices. 
The remainder of this section identically matches the Cryoablation System Preparation Section 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]) of the FROzEN-AF protocol (92348334). 
The Console will create a  record for each ablation attempted, including Ablation Duration, 
Cryoballoon Temperature, Esophagus Temperature (if connected) and DMS activity data. To  
accurately capture information relevant to the study, the following information must be input into 
the Console at each index procedure: 
Prior to Ablation:   
• On the subject information screen, enter the subject’s identification (code provided by [CONTACT_850501]) and the operating physician name. 
• For this study, the DMS must be connected to the subject during right PV ablations (for 
data acquisition). The DMS is an adjunctive sensor designed to monitor a phrenic nerve pacing response.  Standard of care methods for evaluating phrenic nerve function and determining when intervention is needed (e.g., palpation, ICE) should always be applied during right pulmonary vein ablations. The DMS is not intended as a substitute for such standard of care methods.       
1. Place a disposable ECG electrode just below the right-side costal cartilage.  
2. Snap the DMS onto the electrode. 
3. Ask the patient to cough and verify that signal is visible on the console screen. Adjust the position of the electrode if necessary. 
Prior to performing the ablation, pace the phrenic nerve wit h a focal or circular 
catheter positioned superior to the ablation location (e.g., superior vena cava). 
Adjust the pacing settings and catheter location as necessary to attain phrenic nerve capture. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], high output at 20 mA and 800 – 1000 milliseconds (ms) may be needed.

  NOTE:   Avoid or minimize use of paralytics if general anesthesia is used as 
paralytics may interfere with pacing capture of the phrenic nerve.  
4. While pacing the phrenic nerve, adjust the DMS gain and sensitivity levels within 
the Sett ings screen to maximize the DMS signal level in the display window. 
Reduce the gain if the DMS signal appears saturated. Stop pacing until needed for the ablation.  
5. Set the DMS threshold (within the Settings screen) for which the DMS notification will be d isplayed. The suggested DMS threshold setting is 65%, but 
the threshold can be adjusted per physician discretion. 
• The movement amplitude measured by [CONTACT_850502] 100%.  
• If the ph renic nerve pacing response decreases during cryoablation, the DMS 
amplitude will correspondingly decrease. The console will display the DMS amplitude as a percentage of the baseline value. For example, 80% displayed on the console indicates the DMS amplit ude is 80% of the baseline valve and 
that movement amplitude is reduced by 20%.  
6. In case of a DMS notification, continue to closely monitor phrenic nerve activity and pacing capture, and consider immediately interrupting cryoablation.  
 
Balloon Size Select ion: 
Usage of the 31 mm balloon size will be determined by [CONTACT_093]’s medical judgement, 
for each individual cryotherapy application. It is anticipated that individual study subjects 
may receive cryotherapy applications from both [ADDRESS_1182410] be increased from 28 mm to 31 mm by [CONTACT_850543]. The balloon diameter can only be changed when the system is in the “INFLATION” state, prior to initiating  “ABLATION”. After increasing

[IP_ADDRESS].Cryoablation protocol   
This section identically matches the Cryoablation Protocol Section (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) of the 
FROzEN -AF protocol (92348334), except for  step 9.  
All aspects of usage of the POLARx Cryoablation System with POLARx FIT catheters are the same as with POLARx catheters ( including preparation, introduction, occlusion, and ablation) 
with exception for the optional step of increasing the balloon diameter. 
The ablation procedure should follow this recommended sequence: Prepare patient with 
conscious sedation or general anaesthesia. Prepare the vascular access sites per physician preference. Follow anticoagulation protocol in Section 12.5.2. 
1. Intracardiac echo (ICE) may be performed to support the procedure. Record any observation of cardiac structural damage, any evidence of pericardial effusion, or any visible anomalie s on the CRF. 
2. Place additional diagnostic catheters, for example in the coronary sinus or for pacing the phrenic nerve, at the discretion of the physician. 
3. Per institutional protocol, complete transseptal access (single or double).  
4. Baseline the fluoroscopy exposure time.  
5. Per the IFU, prepare the steerable sheath. Insert the steerable sheath over the guidewire and advance the sheath across the atrial septum.  
6. Per the IFU, prepare the cryoablation catheter and the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_169228]. Insert the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850402]. Insert the POLARx FIT Cryoablation Catheter into the steerable sheath and advance it into the left atrium.  
7. Baseline the LA dwell time.  
8. Advance the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850403], including confirming conduction between LA and PV. Electrocardiographic documentation of the subject’s rhythm prior to ablation will be collected. If entrance/exit conduction cannot be recorded due to the subject being in AF, no Protocol Deviation will be req uired. 
9. Per the IFU, inflate the cryoballoon in the left atrium, expand the balloon diameter after inflation  (per physician discretion), and advance the cryoballoon to occlude the targeted 
PV.

 Page [ADDRESS_1182412] inflate to a diameter of 28 mm.  
c. Once inflated  in the LA, the balloon may  be expanded to the 31 mm diameter 
with the  FIT size selection button on the SMARTFREEZE Console. Investigators 
shall use their clinical judgement to determine which balloon diameter ( 28 mm  or 
31 mm ) to use for the treatment of each individual PV. 
d. Advance the inflated cryo balloon to occlude the targeted PV . Remain in the 
atrium outside the tubular portion of the PV. For best results, maneuver the sheath 
and/or catheter to position the distal portion of the balloon at the PV ostium. 
e. Verify PV occlusion. Verification may be performed with fluoroscopy and contrast/saline injection or with other appropriate visualization / assessment techniques such as ICE . If the balloon needs to be deflated for repositioning, use 
the slider switch on the POLARx FIT Catheter handle to simultaneously deflate and extend the balloon.  
f. Document the occlusion score prior to starting the ablation. Ensure the occlusion score was attained for the balloon diameter used for the cryo ablation  application . 
10. Position the esophagus temperature probe as directly posterior to the cryoballoon as possible.  
11. If the selected vessel is a right PV, start phrenic nerve pacing prior to starting the cryoablation. 
12. Start the cryoablation and observe the electrograms for changes in conduction. Identify Time -To-Isolation and set ablation duration as required by [CONTACT_850544] 
(document 92355401 provided separately). Investigators may apply a different dosing 
than the one provided in this document for reasons including technical difficulties, anatomical challenges, or concerns for subject welfare.   
13. Upon completing the ablation, determine if entrance and exit block were achieved. If entrance and exit block are not confirmed, ablate the PV again as required by [CONTACT_850544] (document 92355401). Investigators may apply a different dosing than 
the one provided in this document for reasons including technical difficulties, anatomical challenges, or concerns for subject welfare.  If entrance and exit block are confirmed, reposition the system to target another PV.

  Electrograms from the POLARMAP mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850461]/from the PVs. The PV will only be considered isolated if entrance and exit block are confirmed. Electrogram data must be documented.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Additional ablation(s) 
Additional ablation of non- PV foci that initiate AF (including locations in the LA, RA, or SVC), 
targeting com plex fractionated electrograms or ganglionated plexi or performing left atrial mitral 
isthmus or roof lines are not allowed in this protocol.  
Additional ablation of the cavo- tricuspid isthmus (CTI) with a conventional market approved RF 
catheter is allowed only in case a typi[INVESTIGATOR_850462] (either spontaneously or inducible). 
The Cryoablation System cannot be used for the ablation of other arrhythmia(s)/additional line(s) 
or applications outside the PVs. It is not allowed to perform concomitant procedures during the ablation procedure ( e.g., ICD 
implant, PM, LAAC, arrhythmia loop recorder ).   
If the subject presents with AF after all ablations are complete, cardioversion should be performe d 
and will be noted.  Cardioversions during the Index procedure do not signify procedural failures 
and are not to be reported as adverse events.  Induction of or spontaneous conversion to AF during the procedure will not be considered an adverse event.   
If at any time during the ablation procedure the investigator is unable to continue the ablation with 
the designated investigational catheter (for the PV isolation), the investigator may consider the 
case a procedural failure and complete the case with a device determined best for the subject.  The point at which failure was determined as well as the rationale must be documented.  A protocol deviation will be documented in the EDC system.

12.13. Additional/Repeat Procedure 
It is recommended to use the Cryoablation system for repeated ablation procedures to treat AF (during the blanking period and during the effectiveness evaluation period). 
In case an additional procedure (including but not limited to a repeat ablation procedure for PAF) 
occurs during the month 12 follow-up period, the data of this procedure will be entered in the ‘Additional/ Repeat Procedure’ eCRF.  In case this additional procedure is an ablation procedure (for the same, or different arrhythmias or for an unsuccessful ablation of the arrhythmia presented at index procedure), detailed information about this additional ablation procedure will be entered in  the ‘Additional/Repeat Procedure’ eCRF:  
• Was the additional ablation procedure performed in the LA? If yes, TEE or ICE to rule out presence of left atrial thrombus.   
• For additional ablation procedures performed in the LA: was this additional ablation 
procedure performed to treat AF?  If no, specify the arrhythmia type. 
It is known that a repeat ablation procedure for PAF may be necessary in certain subjects 
after the index ablation procedure due to recurrences of PAF or other tachyarrhythmias requiring treatment.  One repeat ablation procedure for PAF is allowed within the blanking period if considered medically necessary due to patient’s intolerability of the PAF. Use of a non-study device for AF re-ablation during blanking period constitutes a failure for the effectiveness endpoint.  Data for the repeat ablation procedure will be collected in the eCRF.  
Subjects must follow the same anticoagulation requirements as defined for the index procedure in S ection  12.6 prior to proceeding with the repeat ablation procedure for PAF.  
• If a 3D mappi[INVESTIGATOR_850416], additional info will be collected

  • Protocol deviations, if applicable 
The appropriate type of pre-procedure imaging (CT/MRI) is to be determined by [CONTACT_093].  
As available, the PV images must be reviewed against the pre- ablation imaging from the index 
procedure to rule out PV stenosis from the index ablation procedure.

Schedule, Table 9.  
In case of premature termination of the study, please refer to S ection 22.1. 
Following termination/completion of the study, subjects will be managed according to local 
institution practice.

There may be unforeseen circumstances that occur during the study, such as a natural disaster or 
a global pandemic (e.g., COVID-19) that prevents a subject from attending study visits during 
the required follow-up window. While every attempt should be made to avoid disruptions in collecting study data, it is important to collect as much data as possible, by [CONTACT_850508]. This may include obtaining records from an outside clinic, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850417]/EC/REB approved.  
If study data must be collected remotely, every effort should be made to collect the data within 
the study visit window, if possible. Critical data collected during the study includes any procedure or device related adverse events, recurrence of any AF/AT/AFL, and a Cardiac CT or MRI (if PV stenosis is suspected). Event monitors and 24- hour Holter monitors can be used to detect any recurrence of AF/AT/AFL. If a Cardiac CT or MRI is required because PV stenosis is suspected, the Cardiac CT or MRI may be performed at a nother healthcare facility and the 
window to conduct this test may be extended by [CONTACT_796456] (30 days) following the normal study visit window.

The primary safety endpoint at [ADDRESS_1182420] of a composite of the following procedure- related 
and/or device- related adverse events.  
Events will be counted through [ADDRESS_1182421] index procedure. 
• Death  
• Myocardial infarction (MI) 
• Major Vagal Nerve Injury/Gastroparesis  
• Transient ischemic attack (TIA)  
• Stroke/Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)  
• Thromboembolism 
• Cardiac tamponade/perforation*  
• Pneumothorax 
• Major vascular access complications  
• Pulmonary edema/heart failure

  • Severe pulmonary vein stenosis (≥70% reduction in the diameter of the PV or PV branch 
from baseline)* ** 
• Persistent phrenic nerve palsy ****  
*Cardiac tamponade/perforation occurring up to [ADDRESS_1182422] -index- procedure will count as primary safety endpoint 
events  
**AV block not at tributable to medication effect or vasovagal reaction.  
***Atrial esophageal fistula  and severe pulmonary vein stenosis occurring up to [ADDRESS_1182423] -index- procedure will 
count as primary safety endpoint events  
**** Phrenic nerve palsy not resolved at the end of the 3 months follow up will count as primary safety endpoint 
event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypotheses 
Statistical considerations were not utilized in the design of this extension study and t here are no 
formal hypotheses to be tested for the primary safety endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sample Size  
Due to a lack of hypotheses for the objective, the sample size cannot be determined through 
traditional statistical powering techiniques . The chosen sample size of 50 31 mm TREATMENT 
subjects is intended to be a reasonable number to assess the endpoint with a sufficient degree of precision. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Methods  
Analysis of study data will use descriptive statistical methods. For the primary safety endpoint, the Kaplan -Meier [ADDRESS_1182424] a repeat procedure performed with a non-study catheter  without experiencing an event will be censored on the date of withdrawal or repeat 
procedure. T he obs erved primary safety event free rate and its  95%  confidence limits  (calculated 
as the pointwise confidence limit using the log-log methodology) will be provided. 
13.1.2. Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of acute procedural success where acute 
procedural success is defined as the achievement of electrical isolation of all PVs by [CONTACT_850546] S ystem with the POLARx FIT cryoablation balloon catheter models (with 
treatment applied at 28 mm  or 31 mm balloon size per physician discretion) . Electrical isolation 
of a PV is demonstrated by [CONTACT_850490]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypotheses 
Statistical considerations were not utilized in the design of this extension study and there are no formal hypotheses to be tested for the primary effectiveness endpoint.

  [IP_ADDRESS]. Sample Size  
Due to a lack of hypotheses for the objective, the sample size cannot be determined through 
traditional statistical powering techiniques. The chosen sample size of 50 31 mm TREATMENT subjects is intended to be a reasonable number to assess the endpoint with a sufficient degree of precision. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Methods  
Analysis of study data will use descriptive statistical methods. For the primary effectiveness endpoint, the binomial acute procedural success rate and Clopper- Pearson  95% confidence limits 
will be presented.  
13.2. General Statistical Methods  
13.2.1. Analysis Sets 
The primary and secondary safety  endpoints and additional analyses of safety data will use all 
available data from ATTEMPT  and TREATMENT subjects  enrolled in POLARx FIT: 
FROZEN -AF Extension study. The primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints and 
additional analyses of effectiveness data will use all available data from TREATMENT subjects.   
Additionally, in order to further ev aluate the safety and effectiveness of the  POLARx FIT  
catheter  when used at its larger size , an analysis will be performed of each primary and 
secondary endpoint including all available data from 31 mm TREATMENT subjects  only. 
13.2.2. Control of Systematic Error/B ias 
Selection of patients will be made from the Investigator’s population. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria and having signed the ICF will be eligible for enrollment in the study.  Control and reduction of potential bias associated with a single -arm study design have been taken into 
account by [CONTACT_163297] a series of measures including but not limited to: 
• defining inclusion and exclusion criteria to represent a population like  the one enrolled in 
recently completed trials on AF ablation  
• implementing a screening log to document reason(s) for screening failure and a pre- specified 
analysis on screening failures 
• employing a rhythm surveillance monitoring strategy that is equivalent  to that used in recent 
PAF IDE studies and consistent with the relevant recommendation in the HRS consensus document 
• utilizing core lab for reviewing electrocardiographic recordings from study specific rhythm surveillance monitoring after the blanking period

 Page [ADDRESS_1182425] and a per pulmonary vein basis, acute procedural success 
data, and 7- day serious adverse events data will be submitted for a sub -set of these subjects as 
well as a s ummary  of the  study status and safety for all POLARx FIT: FROZEN -AF Extension 
study subjects available at the time of the report. 
Final a nalysis of each endpoint will be performed when all applicable data for that endpoint has 
been collected.  Analysis of the primary endpoints for submission to FDA occur after all 3-month 
data has been collected on all subjects.  
13.3.2. Justification of Pooling 
Poolability of the FROzEN -AF Extension Study data with the data from the main  FROzEN -AF 
study will be assessed for the primary and secondary endpoints of the FROzEN- AF Extension 
Study. The endpoints from the FROzEN -AF Extension study will be evaluated in the FROzEN -
AF study and data from the two studies will be deemed to be poolable if the absolute difference 
in the endpoint rates is found to be less than a clinically meaningful delta . This analysis will 
occur for the FROzEN -AF Extension Study primary endpoints when 3- month  data on all 
subjects has been collected and on the FROzEN -AF Extension Study secondary endpoints when 
12-month data on all subjects has been collected.  
13.3.3. Changes to Plan ned Analyses  
Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the analyses will be documented in an amended Statistical Analysis Plan approved prior to performing the analyses.  Changes from the planned statistical methods after performing the analyses will be documented in the clinical study report along with a reason for the deviation. 
14. Health Economics Outcomes  
This section identically matches the Health E conomics O utcomes  Section ( Section 12) of the 
FROzEN -AF protocol (92348334).

  A formal health economics analysis may be completed as part of this trial study, given 
meaningful clinical results are obtained. This will take into consideration complication rates, quality of life, and resource utilization. The EQ-5D, generi c quality of life measure, will be used 
to assess health utilities. We may estimate costs associated with the health care utilization measures at all sites. These inputs may be used in health economics analysis performed. 
15. Data Management  
Sections 13.1-13.3 identically match sections 13.1-13.3 of the FROzEN-AF protocol (92348334). 
15.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review 
Subject data will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
The clinical database will reside o n a production server hosted by [CONTACT_365002] . All 
changes made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review by [CONTACT_230025]. The associated Rave software and database have been desi gned to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system 
compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies pertaining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are performed regularly. 
The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature [CONTACT_262483] (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature [CONTACT_5761] [CONTACT_1295]. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_5732]. 
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies. 
Manual and /or automatic queries will be created in the Medidata EDC system and will be issued 
to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all queries in the database.  
All access to the clinical database will be changed to “Read  only” after all data is either “Hard 
Locked” or “Entry Locked”. Once acceptance of the final report or finalization of publications (as applicable) is received, final database storage and archiving activities can begin. Once all  the 
closeout activities ar e completed a request to IT is submitted to have the “Database Locked” or 
Decommissioned and all database access revoked.  
Data transfers from other systems such as core labs and electronic questionnaires will be coordinated by [CONTACT_5756].  
CRF Compl etion Guidelines will be created by [CONTACT_850510].

  15.2. Data Retention  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee or Investigational site will maintain  all essential 
study documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study subjects 
in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.   
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee will take measures to prevent accidental or  
premature destruction of these documents. If for any reason the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her 
designee withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change. Sites are required to inform [LOCATION_011] Scientific in writing where paper or electronic files are maintained in case files are stored off site and are not readily available.  
15.3. Technical Source Forms  
The Technical Source Form (TSF) is the sponsor -approved document to capture protocol required 
data elements that are not duplicated in any other source documents. This form requires review and approval by [CONTACT_850511] a source document.  
Collection and completion of all information on the Technical Source Form is the responsibility of the appropriately delegated site personnel. If available, the console operator will provide the delegated site personnel with the s tudy related data collected during the case directly from the 
console. 
At the conclusion of the procedure, the completed technical source form must be signed (and 
initialed as needed) by [CONTACT_850512]: 
• Delegated Site Personnel completing the forms  
• Delegated Investigator conducting and/or supervising the case 
• Console operator supporting the case 
15.4. Core Laboratories 
15.4.1. Event and 24- Hour Holter Monitors’ Core Lab  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Event Monitors 
A Core Lab will provide the center and/or subject all necessary instructions and/or materials related to the use of the event monitor.  Only TREATMENT subjects will be provided with an event monitor, such as a Trans-Telephonic Monitor (TTM), either prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850422]’s residence immediately following discharge.  All events will be analyzed by [CONTACT_850513][INVESTIGATOR_850423].  The Core Lab will make this information accessible to the Investigator center for concurrence.  If there is discordance in arrhythmia classification between

 FROzEN -AF Extension Study , 92797269  
 Rev/Ver  A 
 Page [ADDRESS_1182426] will be used for final rhythm 
determination.  
Within the firs t 90 days (3 months) after the index ablation procedure (blanking period), 
TREATMENT subjects will be instructed to transmit all symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_850424]/or treatment of early recurrences.  After the subject’s [ADDRESS_1182427] two transmissions per month (either symptomatic or asymptomatic) through the 12-month follow-up to ensure continued reporting compliance. If subjects experience symptoms associated with cardiac arrhythmias ( e.g., palpi [INVESTIGATOR_814], lightheadedness, syncope, 
dyspnea) , they will be instructed to transmit a recording. Such recording will count towards the 
required transmission of that period. The Core Lab will work with the investigational site to ensure reporting compliance.   
All event monitors must be returned to the centralized research company upon completion of a 
subject’s 12-month follow-up or withdrawal from the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. 24-Hour Holter Monitors 
Each  TREATMENT subject will be provided with a 24-Hour Holter Monitor at the 12-month 
follow-up visit.   
Investigational centers will be trained on the set- up of the monitors and will provide the subjects 
with the instructions necessary to complete the test.  If a subject has a symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_850466], they will be strongly encouraged to report the symptoms to their physician.  Once the Holter Monitor is returned to the centralized research company, the monitor will be analyzed for all symptomatic and asymptomatic arrhythmia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and investigators w ill 
be informed of the results.   
15.4.2. ECG Core Lab  
To ensure objective assessment of rhythm monitoring data, 12- lead ECG tracings obtained beyond 
[ADDRESS_1182428]-procedure will be reviewed by [CONTACT_50305]. 15.4.3. PV Stenosis Imaging 
Images (CT/MRI) collected  to assess adverse events associated with symptomatic pulmonary vein 
(PV) stenosis will be assessed by [CONTACT_50305]. 
15.5. Quality of Life (QOL)  
Clinical trials increasingly recognize the value of including patient reported outcome measures in 
their design. To understand the impact of atrial fibrillation ablation procedures on patient’s quality of life, the quality -of-life instruments used for the trial will be the EQ -5D- 5L for a 
generic questionnaire and the AFEQT for disease specific. Subjects will be asked to complete the questionnaires at the Enrollment visit as well as at the three, six, and 12-month follow-ups.

 Rev/Ver  A 
 Page [ADDRESS_1182429] on Quality of Life (AFEQT) was developed to evaluate disease-
specific quality of life for patients with atrial fibrillation. The 20 -item questionnaire is 
subdivided into three domains: symptoms, daily activities, and treatment concerns with responses provided on a seven-point Likert scale.  
The EQ -5D, generic quality of life measure, will be used to assess health utilities. It is a 
descriptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions (mobility, 
self-care, usual activiti es, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of 
five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no problems/slight 
problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ -5D 
dimension. 
16. Deviations  
This section identically matches the Deviations Section ( Section 14) of the FROzEN-AF protocol 
(92348334).  An Investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol, except to protect the life and physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. An investigator shall notify the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB/EC/REB, and the regulatory authority if applicable, of any deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency, and those deviations which affect the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Such notice shall be given as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_1182430] be documented and reported to the sponsor using eCRF. Sites may also be required to report deviations to the IRB/EC/REB, per local guidelines and government regulations.  
Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate 
corrective and preventive actions (including IRB/FDA notification, site re-training, or site discontinuation/termination) will be put into place by [CONTACT_456].

20. Potential Risks and Benefits 
This section identically matches the Potential Risks and Benefits  Section (Section 18) of the 
FROzEN -AF protocol (92348334). 
20.1. Anticipated Adverse Events  
Subjects participating in this study are subject to the same risks shared by [CONTACT_850551].  Since the handling characteristics of the Cryoablation System are designed to be similar to  those of other app roved catheters for AF 
ablation, it is anticipated that the rate of catheter -related complications in this study will be 
similar to  those reported from catheter ablations performed with approved catheter ablation 
systems.  The protocol-required testing for this study uses standard techniques that are routinely used for the treatment and management of subjects with drug refractory PAF.  Based upon the current literature and BSC reports on adverse events with an ablation catheter, Table [ADDRESS_1182434].    The following anticipated adverse events (AE) and adverse device effects (ADE) have been identified for this study:

20.2. Risks Associated with the Study Device(s)  
Benchtop studies, pre- clinical research and a CE Mark clinical study have demonstrated that the 
System is safe for human use. All potential risks have been evaluated and mitigation strategies 
have been implemented to reduce potential risks to acceptable levels.  
20.3. Risks associated with Participation in the Clinical Study  
There are no specific tests outside those recommended as standard practice for catheter ablation of PAF required by [CONTACT_239204]. Therefore, there is no foreseen increased risk to subje cts for participating in the FROzEN -AF Study.

20.5. Anticipated Benefits  
Subjects may or may not receive any benefit from participating in this study as compared to the current standard of care received for treatmen t of PAF. Potential benefits of the Cryoablation 
System for the subject may include the following: 
• Complete or partial reduction in symptoms related to PAF  
• Complete or partial reduction in the number of cardioversions, medications a subject is taking, and in the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850472] 
20.6. Risk to Benefit Rationale 
Risk management activities, including Hazard Analyses (HA) and Failure Mode Effects Analyses (FMEA), have been performed on the Cryoablation System, steerable sheath, and extension cable to identify and analyze known and foreseeable hazards (in both normal  and fault conditions) and 
reasonably foreseeable sequences or combinations of events that could result from using this product and the risks associated with each hazard.  Mitigations have been implemented in the design, processes, and/or labeling and directions for use of the product to reduce the residual risk of each hazard as necessary and practicable.  The HA has been reviewed and approved and the remaining risks are acceptable when weighed against the intended benefits to the subject.

CT/MRI scan) listed in S ection  12.4. 
• All BSC commercialized diagnostic catheter -related events  
• All Cryoablation System  Device Related Adverse Events  
• All Device Deficiencies  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects/Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects previously not defined in the IFU/IB a nd ICF  
• New findings/updates in relation to already reported events 
Whenever possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of individual symptoms. 
If it is unclear whether an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot be isolated 
from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or device deficiency. 
Death should not be recorded as an AE but should only be reflected as an outcome of one specific 
SAE ( see Table 12 for Safety  Definitions).  
If an additional ablation procedure is required, this additional ablation procedure should not be considered as an Adve rse Event, unless associated with subject worsening condition or a new 
diagnosis. If the investigator considers this event to be related to any procedure, the event needs to be reported. In this case, the additional ablation procedure should be reported in the Adverse 
Event eCRF as corrective action of the specific procedure-r elated Adverse Event reported for the 
worsening condition or new diagnosis. 
If the patient experiences a new arrhythmia between the index procedure and the end of study, and 
the investigator considers this Adverse Event to be procedure related, it needs to be reported. Refer to Investigator’s Brochure or IFU as appropriate for the known risks associated with the study device(s).  
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be reported a s adverse events unless there has been a 
substantial increase in severity or frequency of the problem which cannot be attributed to the expected progression of the disease or condition. 
The [LOCATION_011] Scientific Medical Safety group will provide safety oversight by [CONTACT_850521]. Routine aggregate safety reviews will be conducted to ensure subject safety. 
Refer to S ection 20 for the known risks associated with the study device(s).

Event  
Classification  Description  
Not Related  
Ref:  
MDCG 2020- 10/1 Relationship to the device, comparator or procedures can be excluded when:  
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device,  or 
the procedures related to the use of the investigational device  
- the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if 
the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible  
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically f easible – and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event  
- the event involves a body- site, or an organ that cannot be affected by [CONTACT_10398]  
- the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. , an underlying  
or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or 
other risk factors)  
- the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_272628], when applicable . To establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria 
listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of 
device/procedures and the serious event.

  Possibly Related  
Ref:  
MDCG 2020- 10/1 The relationship with the use of the investigational device or comparator, or the 
relationship with procedures  is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative 
causes are also possible ( e.g., an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition 
or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases where  relatedness cannot 
be assessed,  or no infor mation has been obtained , should also be classified as possible.  
Probably Related  
Ref:  
MDCG 2020 -10/1 The relationship with the use of the investigational device or comparator, or the 
relationship with procedures  seems relevant and/or the event cannot be  reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_5748].  
Causal Relationship  
Ref:  
MDCG 2020- 10/1 The serious event is associated with the investigational device or with procedures 
beyond reasonable doubt when:  
- the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of 
similar devices and procedures  
- the event has a temporal relationship with investigational device use/application or 
procedures  
- the event involves a body- site or organ that  
-the investigational device or procedures a re applied to  
-the investigational device or procedures have an effect on  
- the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known)  
- the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible) 
- other possible causes (e.g. , an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical c ondition 
or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out  
- harm to the subject is due to error in use  
- the event depends on a false result given by [CONTACT_5749], when applicable  
- In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at 
the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious adverse 
event

  Term  Definition  
Activated Coagulation/Clotting 
Time  ACT is a test that is used to monitor the effectiveness of high dose heparin 
therapy.  
Vagal Nerve 
Injury/Gastroparesis   Vagal nerve injury is defined as injury to the vagal nerve that results in 
esophageal dysmotility or gastroparesis.  Vagal nerve injury is a major 
complication if it prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or results in ongoing symptoms for more than 30 days following an ablation 
procedure  
Vascular access complications  Development of a hematoma, an AV fi stula, or a pseudoaneurysm. A 
major vascular complication is defined as one that requires intervention, such as surgical repair or transfusion, prolongs the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], or 
requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].

29.2. Quality of Life Instruments  
This section identically matches Section 27.3 of the FROzEN -AF protocol (92348334). 
Clinical trials increasingly recognize the value of including patient reported outcome measures in their design. To understand the impact of atrial fibrillation ablation procedures on patient’s quality of life, the quality -of-life instruments used for the trial will be the EQ -5D- 5L for a 
generic questionnaire and the AFEQT for disease specific. Subjects will be asked to complete the questionnaires at the Enrollment visit as well as at the three, six, and 12-month follow-ups.   
The EQ -5D, generic quality of life measure, will be used to assess health utilities. It is a 
descriptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of 
five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no problems/slight

  problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ -5D 
dimension. 
The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT) was developed to evaluate disease-
specific quality of life for patients with atrial fibrillation. The 20 -item questionnaire is 
subdivided into three domains: symptoms, daily activities, and treatment concerns with responses provided on a seven- point Likert scale.  
29.3. National Institutes of Health Stroke Assessment  
This section identically matches Section 27.4 of the FROzEN -AF protocol (92348334). 
The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is an assessment tool which quantifies stroke related neurological deficit.  This assessment must be conducted in-person to provide valuable information on stroke severity.   
An Investigator or appropriately trained and delegated site staff designee will administer NIH 
Stroke Scale assessment prior to the index ablation procedure (Baseline) and again at the pre-discharge visit (0-[ADDRESS_1182456] the ablation procedure).  All individuals conducting the assessment will be required to become certified on administration of the assessment and provide BSC with documentation of certification prior to assessment completion with subjects.    
Investigational sites will be provided with instructions for administering the assessment.  They 
will be instructed to administer stroke scale items in the order listed on the form.  Scores should reflect what the subject does, not what the clinician thinks the subject can do. The clinician should record answers while administering the exam and work quickly.  Except where indicated, the subject should not be coached.  If a worsening score is noted from the previous assessment, the In vestigator must follow the additional requirements defined throughout Section 12.7.  
29.4. CHA2DS2 -VASc Score for AF  
This section identically matches Section 27.5 of the F ROzEN -AF protocol (92348334). 
The CHA2DS2 -VASc score is used for risk stratification of ischemic stroke in patients with 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

Protocol Title:   A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT -494) Once 
Daily Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) Monotherapy in MTX -Naïve Subjects w ith Moderately to 
Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis
Objectives:   
Period 1
1.To compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 7.5 mg once daily (QD) monotherapy (for 
subjects in Japan only), 15 mg QD monotherapy, and 30 mg QD monotherapy versus weekly 
methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy for the treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthr itis 
(RA) in MTX- naïve subjects with moderately to severely active RA.
2.To compare the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy and upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
monotherapy versus weekly MTX monotherapy for prevention of structural progression in 
MTX -naive subjects with moderately to severely active RA.
Period 2
To evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD (for subjects in 
Japan only), [ADDRESS_466432] completed Period 1.
Investig ators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 330
Study Population:   Adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a duration of 
symptoms consistent with RA for ≥ 6 w eeks who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/European League Against 
Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA and no prior or limited MTX treatment.  Eligible 
study subjects must have ≥6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 
68joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and hig h-sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP) 
≥ 5mg/L (central lab, upper limit of normal [ULN] 2.87 mg/L) at Screening.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 975 subjects
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes tw o periods and a Japan sub -study.  Period 1 is a 
48-week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, active comparator controlled treatment period 
designed to compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD monotherapy (for subjects in 
Japan only), 15 mg QD monotherapy, and 30 mg QD monotherapy versus MTX monotherapy in adult 
MTX -naïve subjects with moderately to severely active RA.  Period 1 is also designed to compare the 
efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy and 30 mg QD monotherapy versus M TX m onotherapy 
for the prevention of structural progression.  Period 2 is a long -term extension to evaluate the long -term 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib (7.5, 15, or 30 mg QD) in subjects w ith RA who have 
completed Period 1.

Methodolog y (Continued):
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will receive open -label 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Subjects receiving MTX will receive open -label MTX.
The study duration will include a 35 -day screening period, a 48 -week randomized, double -blind, 
parallel -group, active- comparator controlled treatment period (Period 1); a 212-week extension period 
(blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1) (Period 2); and a 30 -day follow -up (call 
or site vis it).
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment Groups 2, 3 and 4 below , except for subjects 
from Japan, who will be randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4: 
Group 1:  Upadacitinib 7.5mg QD monotherapy ( subjects in Japan only ; N = 7 5)
Group 2:  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy (N = 300) (includes 37 subjects from Japan)
Group 3:  Upadacitinib 30 mg QD monotherapy (N = 300) (includes 37 subjects from Japan)
Group 4:  MTX monotherapy (N = 300)(includes 37 subjects from Japan)
Each subject will be instructed to take 2 capsules once weekly (MTX and/or matching placebo) and 
1tablet once daily (upadacitinib or matching placebo) to maintain blinding.  MTX and matching placebo 
will be assigned via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system, and distributed as identical 
capsules in blister packs, to provide the correct total dose for each individual subject and to maintain 
blinding during and after MTX titration (Period 1 and Period 2).  Detailed dosing instructions can be 
found in the Subject Dosing Diary and Instructions.   Starting w ith Amendment 6 subjects receiving MTX 
will receive open -label MTX tablets in quantities sufficient to cover their respective dose.
Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg QD, or 30 mg QD will start on their 
respective upadacitinib dose at Baseline.  Subjects who are assigned to the MTX treatment group will 
start oral MTX treatment at 10 mg/week and will be titrated up to 20 mg/week (increase by 5 mg every 
4weeks), as tolerated, b y Week 8 (minimum 15 mg/week final dose required, w ith documentation of 
intolerance of > 15 mg/week).  (For subjects in Japan:  start at 7.5 mg/week with titration up to 
10mg/week at Week 4 and to 15 mg/week, as tolerated, by [CONTACT_10585] 8; minimum of 7.5 mg/wee k for final 
dose is required, w ith documentation of intolerance of > 7.5 mg/week).  After completion of MTX (or 
placebo) titration, a single dose reduction of study drug (by 5 mg of MTX) is allow ed for safety reasons, 
up to Week 26, as long as the subject remains on ≥ 15 mg/week of MTX (or matching placebo) w eekly 
(for subjects in Japan:  ≥7.5mg/week).  In addition, all subjects should take a dietary supplement of oral 
folic acid (or equivalent) throughout study participation.  Folic acid dosing and timin g of regimen should 
be follow ed according to Investigator 's discretion.  Rescue therapy has been defined for Weeks 12 
through 24, Week 26, and Weeks 36 through 40.  Starting at the Week 48 Visit (after Week [ADDRESS_466434] been performed) and thereafter, initiation of or change in background RA 
medication(s), including corticosteroids, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
acetaminophen/paracetamol, and csDMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the 
combination of MTX and leflunomide ) is allowed as per local label.
Rescue therapy for those subjects who meet the following criteria from Week 12 through Week 24 are as 
follows:
Those w ho do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared w ith baseline at 
two consecutive visits starting at Week 12 w ill continue on their blinded therapy and the 
Investigator should optimize (initiate or increase) background RA medications:  NSAIDs, 
corticosteroids (oral ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent or prednisone equivalent 
≤0.5mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days) and/or low -potency analgesics.

All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the Full Analysis Set population, which includes all 
randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
Period 1 Efficacy
Analysis of the Prim ary and Key Secondary Endpoints:
For the global analysis, comparisons of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be mad e 
betw een the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups versus the MTX group for all subjects 
(excluding the Japan specific upadacitinib 7.5 mg treatment arm).  The overall type I error rate of the 
primary and key secondary endpoints for the two doses will be strongly controlled.
For the Japan sub -study, comparisons of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be made 
betw een the upadacitinib 7.[ADDRESS_466448] deviation, median, and range will be reported for each 
treatment group.  Pairw ise comparisons betw een each of the upadacitinib treatment groups and the MTX 
group will be carried out using the analysis of covariance model w ith treatment group as the fixed factor, 
and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates.
For mTSS -based endpoints, both linear extrapolation and as observed analysis will be conducted.  For 
other endpoints, non -responder imputation approach w ill serve as the primary analysis approach for key 
binary endpoints and multiple imputations will serve as the primary analysis approach for key continuous 
endpoints.  Sensitivity analyses based on observ ed cases will also be conducted for key endpoints.

3.0 Introduction
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic s ystemic inflammatory  disease of unknown 
etiology .  The hallmark feature of RA is an inflammatory  process manifested by  [CONTACT_176409], 
deformity , and disability .  Left untreated, or inadequately  treated, progressive functional 
impairment with increasing disability  occurs leading to a reduction in quality  of life.  The 
prevalence of RA in the general population is approximately  1%, and increases with age 
in both genders, with women bei ng more prone to developi[INVESTIGATOR_176356].  Earl y 
therap y with disease -modify ing anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is the standard of care, 
including conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) (e.g., methotrexate [MTX], 
sulfasalazine, hy droxy chloroquine, and leflu nomide), and biologic DMARDs 
(bDMARDs) (e.g., anti -tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and non- anti-TNF biologics).
The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends a Treat -to-Target 
(T2T) approach to initiate therap y immediatel y after diagnosis of RA wit h a goal of 
achieving clinical remission (CR) or low disease activity  (LDA), as these are associated 
with improved long -term outcomes.1-[ADDRESS_466467] been developed.  The 2010 American College 
of Rheumatology  (ACR)/EULAR classification criteria redefined the paradigm of RA b y 
focusing on features at earlier stages of disease that are associated with persistent and/or 
erosive disea se, rather than defining the disease by  [CONTACT_176410] -stage features.[ADDRESS_466468] 2015 -003334 -27
29
JAK Inhibitor
Evidence suggests that inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) -mediated pathway s is a 
promising approach for the treatment of patients with this chronic disease.8  [COMPANY_013] is
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, upadacitinib (ABT -494), that may  address 
the current needs.
The JAK family  is composed of 4 famil y members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyrosine kinase 2 
(Tyk2).  These cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases are associated with me mbrane cy tokine 
receptors such as common gamma -chain receptors and the gly coprotein [ADDRESS_466469] in this class, has been approved in the 
[LOCATION_002] and in other countries for treating moderately  to severely  active RA patients.  
Although tofacitinib, a non-selective JAK inhibitor, improves the clinical signs and 
symptoms, and inhibits structural progression in RA patients, questions regarding the 
safet y profile remain, including serious infections, herpes zoster reactivation, 
malignancies, and hematologi c adverse events (AEs).
The second generation of JAK inhibitors, with different selectivity  profiles against JAK1, 
JAK2, JAK3, and Ty k2, are in development.[ADDRESS_466470] s (i.e., interleukin -6) without causing excessive anemia due to its 
reduced activity  against JAK2 (IC [ZIP_CODE] nM), which is essential f or ery thropoietin 
signaling.  Upadacitinib is also less potent against JAK3 (I C502.3 µM), an important 
component of ly mphocy te activation and function.  As such, treatment with upadacitinib, 
a selective JAK1 inhibitor with reduced JAK3 inhibition, could r esult in a decreased risk 
for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or malignancy compared to a pan JAK 
inhibitor or less selective JAK inhibitors.
Phase 2 Studies with Upadacitinib
The Phase 2 program for upadacitinib consisted of 2 randomized cont rolled trials (RCTs), 
both on stable background MTX therap y, in subjects with moderatel y to severel y active 
RA and one open -label extension (OL E) stud y (Study M13 -538; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for those 
subjects who had completed either one of the RCTs.  Study  M13 -550([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response to anti -TNF therap y and 
Study M13 -537 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) enrolled subjects who had shown an inadequate 
response to MTX.  A total of 4 twice dail y (BID) and 1 once dail y (QD) dose regimens of 
upadac itinib immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, 18 mg BID, 
and 24 mg QD) were evaluated.
In TNF -inadequate responder (TNF -IR) subjects, who represent the population with the 
greatest unmet need, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was 
significantl y greater at all doses of upadacitinib (up to 73%) compared with placebo 
(35%).  In addition, numericall y higher proportions of subjects achieved ACR50 and 
ACR70 responses and LDA (based on Disease Activity  Score [DAS][ADDRESS_466471] ive 
Protein [CRP] and Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI ]) in the upadacitinib dose 
groups versus placebo.
In MTX -inadequate responder (MTX -IR) subjects, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 
response rate at Week 12 was significantly greater (up to 82%) at all but the lowest dose  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466472] 2015 -003334 -27
31
of upadacitinib compared with placebo (50%).  At all doses of upadacitinib compared to 
placebo, significantl y higher proportions of subjects achieved LDA and CR at Week 12.
Safety  data from these two studies (N = 575) showed that the t ypes and frequencies of 
AEs during upadacitinib treatment were consistent with subjects with moderatel y to 
severel y active RA receiving immunomodulatory  therapy .  The incidences of AEs were 
numericall y higher in the upadacitinib dose groups, with a trend t oward higher rates with 
higher doses of upadacitinib.  The most frequentl y reported AEs ( ≥ 5%) in the 
upadacitinib treated subjects were urinary  tract infection, headache, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_40947], and nausea.  There were 6 subjects (1.3% of total combined populations) with 
herpes zoster reactivation distributed across the upadacitinib dose groups, and 2 subjects 
(1.9%) in the placebo groups.  I n these two [ADDRESS_466473] reported non -
melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) and [ADDRESS_466474] 
was diagnosed with lung cancer after the final scheduled visit, and subsequently died 
14weeks after stud y completion.  These events were re ported by  [CONTACT_372883].  Elevations of liver function tests were sporadic with no 
clear dose -response relationship observed.  As observed with other JAK inhibitors, 
treatment with upadacitinib resulted in an incre ase in lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (low -density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol [L DL-C] and high- densit y lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL -C]).  Among subjects 
with laboratory  evidence of sy stemic inflammation (as evidenced b y high -sensitivity  
C-reactive protein [hsCRP] > upper limit of normal [UL N]), treatment with lower doses 
of upadacitinib (3 mg BID and 6 mg BID) was associated with improvements in mean 
hemoglobin relative to placebo.  At higher doses, there was a reduction in mean 
hemoglobin; however, the mean hemoglobin levels remaine d within normal range 
throughout the treatment period.

3.2 Benefits and Risks
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96631] y of various RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including csDMARDs and bDMARDs, 
many  patients still do not respond adequatel y to these treatments, or gradually lose 
response over time.  Upad acitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability  to 
decrease joint inflammation and damage mediated by  [CONTACT_166527]1 signaling while having 
minimal inhibitory  effects on JAK2 and JAK3.  This could potentially  minimize some of 
the reported safet y concer ns with non -selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be 
mediated b y inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways.  The Phase 2 program 
with upadacitinib demonstrated efficacy  for improvement in signs and s ymptoms of RA 
and the safety  results were co nsistent with those known to be associated with JAK 
inhibition.13-21  Taken together, the safet y and efficacy data from the Phase 2 program 
support further development of upadacitinib in Phase 3 in subjects with RA.
In view of the COVID -19 pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various 
immunomodulatory  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82624] -19 is being e valuated.  At this time, the effects 
of upadacitinib on the course of COVID -19 are not well defined.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods and a Japan sub -study .  
Period 1 is a 48- week randomi zed, double -blind, parallel -group, active comparator 
controlled treatment period designed to compare the safet y and efficacy  of upadacitinib 
7.5mg QD monotherap y (for subjects in Japan only), 15 mg QD monotherapy, and 30 mg 
QD monotherap y versus MTX monot herap y in adult MTX -naïve subjects with 
moderatel y to severel y active RA.  Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherap y and 30 mg QD monotherap y versus MTX 
monotherap y for the prevention of structural progression. Period 2 is a long -term 
extension to evaluate the long -term safet y, tolerability , and efficacy  of upadacitinib (7.5, 
15, or 30 mg QD) in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.   Starting with 
Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will receive 
open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Subjects receiving MTX will receive open-label 
MTX.
The study  is designed to enroll approximately  975 subjects at approximately  
330study centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory  objectives without enrolling 
an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the 
target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility  that additional subjects 
in screening may  not be enrolled.
The study  duration wil l include a 35 -day screening period, a 48 -week randomized, 
double -blind, parallel -group, active -comparator controlled treatment period (Period 1); a

212week long -term extension period (blinded until the last subject completes the last visit 
of Period 1) ( Period 2); and a 30 -day follow -up (call or site visit).
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment Groups 2, 3 and 4 below, except 
for subjects from Japan, who will be randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4:
●Group 1:  Upadacit inib 7.5mg QD monotherap y (subjects in Japan only ; 
N = 75)
● Group 2 :  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherap y (N = 300) (includes 
37subjects from Japan)
● Group 3 :  Upadacitinib 30 mg QD monotherap y (N = 300) (includes 
37subjects from Japan)
● Group 4 :  MTX monotherapy  (N = 300) (includes 37 subjects from Japan)
Each subject will be instructed to take 2 capsules once weekl y (MTX and/or matching 
placebo) and 1 tablet once daily ( upadacitinib or matching placebo) to maintain blinding.  
MTX and matching placebo will be assigned via the Interactive Response Technology  
(IRT) sy stem, and distributed as identical capsules in blister packs, to provide the correct 
total dose for each individual subject and to maintain blinding during and after MTX 
titration (Pe riod 1 and Period 2).  Detailed dosing instructions can be found in the Subject 
Dosing Diary  and Instructions. Starting with Amendment 6 subjects receiving MTX will 
receive open- label MTX tablets in quantities sufficient to cover their respective dose.
Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg QD, or 30 mg QD will start 
on their respective upadacitinib dose at Baseline.  Subjects who are assigned to the MTX 
treatment group will start oral MTX treatment at 10 mg/week and will be titrated up to 
20mg/week (increase b y 5 mg every 4 weeks), as tolerated, b y Week 8 (minimum 
15mg/week final dose required, with documentation of intolerance of > 15 mg/week).  
(For subjects in Japan:  start at 7.5 mg/week with titration up to 10 mg/week at Week 4 
and to 15 mg/week, as tolerated, b y Week 8; minimum of 7.5 mg/week for final dose is

the screening period.  If the re -tested lab value(s) remain exclusionary , the subject will be 
considered a screen failure with no additional re -screening possible.  Redrawing samples 
if initial samples were unable to be analy zed would not count as a retest since initial result 
was never obtained.
Subjects that initially  screen fail for the study  are permitted to re -screen once following 
re-consent.  For additional re -screening, [COMPANY_013] The rapeutic Area Medical Director 
approval is required.  All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below 
will be repeated during re -screening.  The subject must meet all the inclusion and none of 
the exclusion criteria at the time of re -screening in order to qualify  for the study .  There is 
no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re -screen for the stud y.  If the subject 
had a complete initial screening evaluation including the assessment of an Interferon -
Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA; Qu antiFERON Tuberculosis [TB] Gold I n Tube test) or a 
purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) test (or equivalent), or chest x -ray and 
electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for re -screening 
provided the conditions noted in Sectio n 5.[ADDRESS_466491] 
passed.
Period 1 (48 -Week Randomized, Double -Blind Treatment Period)
Period 1 will begin at the Baselin e Visit (Day  1) and will end at the Week 48 Visit.  At the 
Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study  and 
randomized to double -blind treatment.  During this period o f the stud y, subjects will visit 
the study  site at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 26, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 48.  A ± 3 day 
window is permitted around scheduled stud y visits until Week 32 and then ± 7days for 
the remainder of the period.  The last dose of study  drug in Period [ADDRESS_466492] 2015 -003334 -27

Period 2 (Long- Term Extension Period [212 Weeks])
Period [ADDRESS_466493] been completed.  During 
Period 2, subjects will visit the study  site at Weeks 60, 72, 84, 96, every  12 weeks through 
Week 240, and Week 260/PD.  A ± 7- day window is permitted around scheduled study  
visits.   Starting at Week 48, subjects who fail to show at least 20% improvement in both 
TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits, despi[INVESTIGATOR_372862] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for permitted background RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), 
will be discontinued from study  drug.  Therefore, the earliest discontinuation would be at 
Week 60, after completion of all Week 60 study  visit activities.
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will 
receive open- label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Subjects receiving MTX will receive open-
label MTX.
Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Stu dy Participation (Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may  discontinue study  drug treatment, but may  choose to continue to participate 
in the study  (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study  drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) as 
soon as possible, preferably  within 2 weeks , and preferabl y prior to initiation of another 
therap y.  To minimize missing data for efficacy  and safet y assessments, subjects who 
prematurel y discontinue study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all 
regularl y scheduled visits as outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix Dand 
Appendix F), unless subjects have decided to discontinue study  participation entirely  
(withdrawal of informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific 
importance of their data e ven if they  discontinue treatment with study  drug earl y.  
Following discontinuation of study  drug, the subject should be treated in accordance with 
the investigator' s best clinical judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides to 
continue participat ion in the study .  In addition, all future rescue -and efficacy -driven 
discontinuation criteria no longer appl y.  This includes 20% TJC/SJC calculations at 
Weeks 12 –24, Weeks 36 – [ADDRESS_466494] no longer wants to provide assessments 
(withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study  drug, a second PD 
visit is not required.
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent) ( Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may withdraw from the study  completely (withdrawal of informed consent) for 
any reason at any  time (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  If a subject 
prematurel y discontinues study drug treatment and study participation (withdrawal of 
informed consent) the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation Visit (PD 
Visit) should be completed as soon as p ossible, preferabl y within [ADDRESS_466495] is willing, a 30 -day follow- up visit (or phone call if a visit is not possible) may  
occur to determine the status of any  ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any  new 
AEs/SAEs.
Follow -Up Visit
A Follow -Up Visit will occur approximately  [ADDRESS_466496] dose of study  drug to 
obtain information on any  new or ongoing AE/SAEs, and to collect vital signs and clinical 
laboratory  tests.
Subjects will complete the Follow -Up Visit when they  have either:
●Completed the last visit of Period 1 (Week 48), but decided not to participate 
in the extension Period 2; OR
●Completed the last visit of Period 2 (Week 26 0); OR
●Prematurel y discontinued study drug and/or study participation.  This visit 
may be a telephone call if a site visit is not possible.  Vital signs and laboratory  
test may  not be required.  The Follow -Up Visit is not applicable for subjects 
who discontinued st udy drug and continued stud y participation and completed 
at least one study visit at least approximately [ADDRESS_466497] 2015 -003334 -27

Protocol Modifications due to State of Emergency or Pandemic like COVID -19
Study  visits may  be impacted b y a pandemic situati on (including the COVID -19 
pandemic) or an y state of emergency.  If visits cannot be conducted onsite due to travel 
restrictions or other pandemic -related reasons, virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, 
or changes in the visit frequency and timin g of study  procedures, among others may  be 
performed.  Additional details are provided in the subsequent sections.  Every effort 
should be made to ensure the safet y of subjects and site staff, while maintaining the 
integrit y of the stud y.

5.2.3 Prior, Concomitant, and Prohibited Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements including folic acid) that the subject is receiving 
within [ADDRESS_466519] be recorded along 
with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and dosage 
information including dose, route and frequency  on the appropriate electronic case report 
form (eCRF).  Also, me dications including but not limited to DMARDs taken for RA 
(based on subject recollection and available medical records), should be entered into the 
appropriate eCRF.
The [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director should be contact[CONTACT_43205] y 
questions regarding concomitant or prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted Background RA  Therapy
Subjects should continue on their stable doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
oral corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day ), or inhaled corticosteroids.
●If taking any of the above on a scheduled basis, they should continue to take 
them as they  did at study  entry  with no change in dose or frequency , including 
on study  visit day s.
●If not taking an y of the above at baseline, these must not be initiated except 
where permitted b y protocol -defined rescue therapy .
●If taking an y of the above, including low potency analgesics, i.e., tramadol, 
codeine, h ydrocodone, or propox yphene at baseli ne on an as -needed basis 
(PRN), they  should continue to use them for the same reason and same dose 
each time but they  should not be taken within the 24 hours prior to any  study  
visit to avoid bias in outcome measurements.
In the event of tolerability (or other safety) issues, the doses of these medications may be 
decreased or discontinued with substitution of another permitted medication from that 
class (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) .  PRN use of inhaled corticosteroids is 
permitted at an y time.

In Period 1, starting at Week 26 (after Week [ADDRESS_466521] been performed) and 
thereafter, intra-articular, intramuscular, intravenous, trigger point or tender point, intra -
bursa, and intra -tendon sheath injections of corticosteroids, dosage and frequency  per 
standard of care, are allowed.  To avoid confounding effects of s ystemic absorption of 
intra-articular corticosteroids, joint injections should be avoided, if possible, within 
21days prior to the next scheduled study  visit.  For the anal ysis of the TJC and SJC, 
injected joints will be considered "not assessable "for 3 months from the time o f the 
intra-articular injection.  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for rescue therap y at Week 26.
In Period 2, starting at Week 48 (after Week [ADDRESS_466522] been performed) and 
thereafter, initiation of or change in corticosteroids (including:  oral, intra -articular, trigger 
point or tender point, intra -bursa, intra -tendon sheath, intramuscular and intravenous) is 
allowed.  In addition, the initiation o f or change in NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol 
and low potency  narcotics is also permitted to optimize concomitant RA medications.  
Adding one of the following, sulfasalazine, hydrox ychloroquine, or chloroquine, is also 
permitted, as per local label.  Pe riod [ADDRESS_466523] is not taking MTX, he/she may add a maximum of 2 csDMARDs, 
including MTX, leflunomide, sulfasala zine, hy droxy chloroquine, or chloroquine, but not 
MTX plus leflunomide.  For RA flare treatment, no more than 3 consecutive days of high-
dose sy stemic corticosteroids (maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day  of prednisone or its 
equivalent) are allowed, after which subject should resume his/her usual daily  oral 
corticosteroid dose.
Traditional Chinese Medicine
Traditional oral Chinese medicine cannot be initiated or changed during the study as these 
may interfere with upadacitinib metabolism and exposure and may  impa ct efficacy  and 
safet y of upadacitinib treatment.

Investigational Drugs
Subjects who have been treated with an y investigational drug within 30 days or 
fivehalf-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study  drug are 
excluded from participation in this study .  Investigational dru gs are also prohibited during 
the study .
Vaccines
Although not mandated by [CONTACT_760], vaccines recommended b y local guidelines 
should be considered.  If the subject and investigator choose to administer live vaccines, 
these vaccinations must be complete d (per local label) [ADDRESS_466530] 30 day s (or longer if required locally ) after last dose of study  drug.
Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:
●Monovalent live influenza A (H1N1) (intranasal);
●Seasonal trivalent live influenza (intranasal);
●Zostavax (herpes zoster, live attenuated);
●Rotavirus;

In Period 2, if a live vaccine must be administered during stud y participation, study drug 
must be held for at least [ADDRESS_466532] 30 days after the 
vaccination (or longer if required locally).
If the live herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered and there is no known history of 
primary  varicella (chicken pox), preexisting immunity  to varicella should be co nfirmed 
with antibody  testing prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine.  If varicella 
antibody  testing is negative, the live herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered.
Administration of inactivated (non -live) vaccines is permitted during the study  according 
to local practice guidelines.  Examples of common vaccines that are inactivated, toxoid or 
biosy nthetic, include but are not limited to:  injectable influenza vaccine, pneumococcal, 
Shingrix (zoster vaccine, recombinant, adjuvanted) an d, pertussis (Tdap) vaccines. 
If the nasal Influenza vaccine is administered, the vaccine must be administered at least 
4weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendatio n for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176366] h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/ mL. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466535] is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required and a serum pregnancy test must be performed (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective me thods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day 1 (or 
earlier) through at least [ADDRESS_466536] dose of study drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associat ed with the inhibition of 
ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Stud y Day 1.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilatera l tubal occlusion/ligation. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466537] 2015 -003334 -27
60
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received 
medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of 
the women of childbearing potential trial participant.
●Intrauterine device (I UD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
●True abstinence (if acceptable per local requirements):  Refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the subject (periodic abstinence [e.g., calen dar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable).
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of t he highly  
effective birth control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence).
It is important to note that contraception recommendations described above are 
specificall y intended to prevent pregnancy during and after exposure to the investigational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], upadacitinib and MTX.  In Period 2, starting at Week 48, concomitant 
csDMARDs (i.e., sulfasalazine, hy droxychloroquine, chloroquine and leflunomide) can be 
prescribed, per standard of care.  The duration of contraception after discontinuation of 
these prescribed csDMARDs should be based on the local label.
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation is available, contraception measures as defined above are no 
longer required.
Additional local requirements may  appl y.  Refer to Appendix Cfor local requirements 
(Canada and Colombia).
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requirements for male subjects receiving upadacitinib only , or 
their female partner(s).   
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466538] receiving MTX who is sexually  active with female partner(s) of 
childbearing potential must agree from Study  Day  [ADDRESS_466539] dose 
of MTX study  drug to practice contraception with:
●Condom use and female partner(s) using at lea st one of the contraceptive 
measures (as defined in the protocol for female study subjects of childbearing 
potential) .
●True abstinence: Refraining from heterosexual intercourse -when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject .  (Note:  Periodic 
abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods]
and withdrawal are not acce ptable).
Additionally , male subjects receiving MTX must agree not to donate sperm from Study  
Day [ADDRESS_466540] dose of MTX study  drug.
Male subjects receiving MTX are responsible for informing his partner(s) of the risk of 
becoming pregnant and for reporting an y pregnancy  to the study  doctor.  
It is important to note that contraception and sperm donation recommend ations described 
above are specificall y intended to prevent pregnancy during and after exposure to the 
investigational therap y, MTX.   In Period 2, starting at Week 48, concomitant csDMARDs 
(i.e., sulfasalazine, h ydrox ychloroquine, chloroquine and leflunomi de) can be prescribed, 
per standard of care.  The duration of contraception and requirement not to donate sperm 
after discontinuation of these prescribed csDMARDs should be based on the local label.
Additional local requirements may  appl y.  Refer to Appendix Cfor local requirements 
(Canada and Colombia).

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
The study  procedures outlined in Appe ndix Dand Appendix Fare discussed in detail in 
this section, with the exception of exploratory research and validation studies (discussed 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), drug concentration measurements (discussed in Section 5.3.2), the 
collection of prior and con comitant medication information (discussed in Section 5.2.3), 
and the collection of AE information (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study  data will be 
recorded in source documents and on the appropriate eCRFs.
Informed Consent
At the Screening Visit, the subject will sign and date a study spec ific, IEC/IRB approved, 
informed consent form for the study  (i.e., includes both Periods 1 and 2) before an y stud y 
procedures are performed or any medications are withheld from the subject in order to 
participate in this study .  Separate written consent wi ll be required for each subject in 
order to participate in the optional exploratory  research and validation studies.  The 
separate written consent may  be part of the main consent form.  Subjects can withdraw 
informed consent at an y time.
Details regarding how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in 
Section 9.3.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be evaluated to ensure they  meet all inclusion criteria and have none of the 
exclusion criteria at both Screening and Baseline Visits. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466544] 's specific RA -related medical and surgical history will be recorded at 
Screening.  History  of herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B 
vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history .  An updated medical 
history  will be obtained prior to study  drug administration at Baseline, to ensure the 
subject is still eligible for enrollment.
A detailed medical history with respect to TB risk factor s will be documented in the study  
source documentation.  This information will include BCG vaccination, cohabitation with 
individuals who have had TB, and travel to, residence in, or work in TB endemic 
locations.

The subject should complete the questionnaires before site perso nnel perform any  clinical 
assessments and before any  interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing 
the subject 's response.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, questionnaires will be 
completed b y the subject at the next feasible visit.
TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis
The TB screening tests are diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the 
subject' s epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] , histor y, exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB.
At Screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB b y a risk 
assessment form ( Appendix I) and tested for TB infection by  [CONTACT_82736] -TB Gold test.  
The [COMPANY_003] skin test should be utilized only  when a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is not 
possible for an y reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines).  The site staff 
will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate eCRF. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466546] had a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold (and/or [COMPANY_003]) test (or IGRA 
equivalent such as T -SPOT TB test) within [ADDRESS_466547] 's medical history  to warrant a repeat test.  These cases may be 
discussed with the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director.  The results of the TB 
test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.
For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or most recent evaluation, an 
annual TB re -test will be performed.  The TB test(s) to be performed depends on local 
guidelines and whether or not the site has capacit y to perform QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
testing (see below).  If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a chest x -ray 
(CXR) needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus 
latent TB.  Expert consultation can be considered per Investigator 's discretion.  Any  
positive TB test result after the patient has started study drug should be reported as an 
adverse event (AE).
TB Test:
●For regions that require both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFERON -TB Gold testing, both 
will be performed.  A positive TB test is defined by  [CONTACT_13144] (for 
example, in some countries, both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFERON- TB Gold are 
performe d, and if either one is positive, the TB test is considered positive). 
●In the absence of local guidelines defining a positive result when both [COMPANY_003] 
and QuantiFERON -TB Gold tests are performed, then the QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold test result will be the TB test re sult (QuantiFERON supersedes [COMPANY_003]).
●If a site has the capacit y to perform both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
tests, and local guidelines require onl y one test to be performed, then the 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold is the preferred test.  At a site with capacit y to 
perform both tests, whatever TB test method (i.e., [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON- TB 
Gold or other IGRA) was performed at screening, then the subject should have 
their annual TB test performed with the same test method.
●If QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is NOT possible (or if both the 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold testand the [COMPANY_003] skin test are required per local  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466548] 2015 -003334 -27

guidelines) :  the [COMPANY_003] skin test (also known as a TB skin test) will be 
performed according to standard clinical practice. The TB skin test should be 
read b y alicensed healthca re professional between [ADDRESS_466549].  The reaction will be measured in millimeters 
(mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm for RA subjects is considered a 
positive reaction.  The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm "not 
"negative. "  Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB skin test in 
the past should not be re -exposed and the TB Skin Test should be considered
positive with no requirement for subsequent testing with either [COMPANY_003] or 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold test .
●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator 
should perform a local QuantiFERON- TB Gold test (or through the central 
laboratory  if not locally available) to rule out a positive test result.  I f testing 
remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be 
positive for the purpose of this study .  If the testing result is negative, then the 
patient is considered to be negative.
●Interpretation of a positive annual TB test in low risk subjects:  I n cases where 
the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test by  [CONTACT_372885][INVESTIGATOR_110958], the In vestigator may  perform a local QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory  if not locally  available) to 
confirm the positive test result.  If the repeat testing result is negative, the 
Investigator may  consider the test to be negative based on his/her clinical 
judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the test is 
considered positive.
●An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) (such as T -SPOT TB 
test) may  be substituted for the Qua ntiFERON -TB Gold test.
●Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold Test (or equivalent) and/or [COMPANY_003] are not required to repeat either test 
during the stud y and should be considered positive.  Annual TB questionnaire 
should be completed for ALL subjects.

TB, including signs and sy mptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or s ymptoms and a 
CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see 
below).  Subjects with evidence of active TB may  not be enrolled.
TB Prophylaxis:
At Screening, if the subject has evidence of a latent TB infection (positive TB test and the 
subject has a CXR not suggestive of active TB), prophylactic treatment must be initiated 
at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study  drug (or per local guide lines, whichever is 
longer).  The proph ylaxis needs to be completed; however, the full course of proph ylaxis 
does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study drug.  If the Investigator 
deems that it is necessary, consultation with a TB expert could be considered.

Subjects with a documented completion of a full course of anti -TB therapy  greater than 
1year prior to first study  drug administration may be allowed to enter the study  only after 
consultation with the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
Newl y initiated proph ylactic treatment should be captured in the eCRF and i n the source 
documents.  Prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF.
During the study , subjects with new evidence of latent TB should initiate prophylactic 
treatment immediatel y per local guidelines.  Study drug(s) should notbe withheld and 
Isoniazid and/or rifampin/rifapentine should be initiated and 2 to 4 weeks later (per local 
guidelines), subject should be re -evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and sy mptoms of

[COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
Chest X- Ray (CXR)
A CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) is required:
●For all subjects at Screening to rule out the presence of TB or other clinically  
relevant findings.  The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous 
normal CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) within [ADDRESS_466553] 's medical history  to warrant a 
repeat test.

[CONTACT_176418] (Appendix I) or for subjects living in areas 
endemic for TB or for subjects with newly positive [COMPANY_003] and/or 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold test.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVI D-19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit requires 
completion of a CXR, the CXR will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit, unless 
the Investigator has determined, based on clinical jud gement, that a CXR is required to 
ensure that it is safe to continue study drug administration. In this case, CXR should be 
performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/facility.
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any  time du ring the stud y as warranted, based on the

12-Lead ECG
For all subjects, a resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening and every  
48weeks thereafter, as specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  A qualified phy sician 
will interpret the clinical significance of any abnormal finding, sign, and date each ECG.  
ECG with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia 's correction formula 
(QTcF) should be reported (or calculated) and documented in the source documents and 
later transcribed on to the appropriat e eCRF if QTcF prolongation is observed.  A valid

X-Rays of Hands and Feet
Detailed instructions for performing and transmitting the stud y related x -rays of hands and 
feet are provided in a separate Imaging Acquisitio n Guideline (IAG)/Site Operational 
Manual.
Handling of X- Rays of Hands and Feet at Screening
Screening x- rays of bilateral hands (posterior -anterior view) and bilateral feet 
(anteroposterior view) must be performed within the 35- day screening period.

specifications outlined in the IAG/Site Operations Manual.  X -rays not meeting the 
quality  requirements must be repeated within the [ADDRESS_466558]' s health.
Handling of X- Rays of Hands and Feet after Baseline
Handling of x -rays of hands and feet after baseline in Period 1 is illustrated in Figure 3.  
All subjects (regardless of response) will receive Week 24 x -rays (Figure 3, box A) and 
Week 48 x -rays (Figure 3, box B).
If a subject prematurely  discontinues from the study  (withdrawal of informed consent), 
depending on the time of discontinuation, new x -rays might be needed.
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue before Week 12 will not get x -rays 
(Figure 3, box C)
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from Week 12 to before Week 24 
(≥Week 12 and < Week 24), will have new x -rays performed ( Figure 3,

If a subject prematurely  discontinues from study  drug but continues to participate in the 
study , subject should follow the regular visit schedule as outlined in Appendix Dand 
Appendix F, including performance of scheduled x -rays of hands and feet.  However, 
depending on the time of study  drug discontinuation in Period 1, ne w x-rays might be 
needed.
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study  drug before Week 12 will 
not get new x-rays.
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study drug from Week 12 to 
Week 16 (≥Week 12 and ≤ Week 16), will have new x -rays performed.
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study  drug after Week 16to

to an AE or part of each subject 's medical history  will be captured on the appropriate 
eCRF page.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit by [CONTACT_372886], the complete phy sical examination will be performed at the next feasible 
visit.
At any  time, a sy mptom -directed ph ysical examination can be performed as deemed 
necessary  by [CONTACT_737].
Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS
At visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F, the Phy sician will rate global 
assessment of subject 's current disease activit y ranging from [ADDRESS_466563]' s self -assessment using the VAS, which consists of a horizontal [ADDRESS_466564] 2015 -003334 -27

Due to a state of emergen cy or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, the Phy sician Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity  will be completed by  [CONTACT_176421].
TJC and SJC Asse ssment
TJC Assessment
An assessment of 68 joints ( Appendix H) will be done for tenderness b y pressure 
manipulation on phy sical examination at visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  
Joint pain/tenderness will be classified as:  present ( "1"), absent ( "0"), replaced ( "9") or no 
assessment ( "NA").
SJC Assessment
An assessment of 66 joints ( Appendix H) will be done by [CONTACT_372887] F.  The joints to be examined for swelling 
are the same as those examined for tendernes s, except the hip joints are excluded.  Joint 
swelling will be classified as present ( "1"), absent ( "0"), replaced ( "9") or no assessment 
("NA").
Any injected joints will be considered as "not assessed" (" NA") for [ADDRESS_466565] 2015 -003334 -27

be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, physician 's assista nt, phy sician).  An y 
other joint assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments.  I t is 
the responsibility  of the Investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained 
to perform joint assessments.  If the independent a ssessor is not available, the pre -
identified back- up assessor should perform such assessments.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, the TJC and SJC will be 
performed at the next feasible visit by  [CONTACT_176404], if possible.
CDAI
The CDAI calculation is required to determine if a subject fails to achieve Clinical 
Remission at the Week 26 visit.  An I nteractive Response Technology  (IRT) will calculate 
CDAI  with input from site personnel on joint counts and the subject 's and phy sician 's 
Global Assessment of RA Disease Activity  score.  A worksheet will be provided to 
capture the components required for IRT entry  to obtain the CDAI cal culation.
The calculation used to determine CDAI score at Week 26 is as follows:
CDAI  = TJC28 + SJC28 + PtGA + PhGA
NOTE:  As described in the section pertaining to Rescue Therap y, the Investigator should 
optimize background RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_372870] a CDAI ≤ 2.[ADDRESS_466566] 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC.
Pregnancy Test
A serum pregnancy  test will be performed for all women of child bearing potential at the 
Screening Visit.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by  [CONTACT_11378] .  If the serum pregnancy  test is positive the subject is considered a screen 
failure.  If the serum pregnancy  test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ [ADDRESS_466567] is:

●Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
●Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;
●Still borderline, ≥ [ADDRESS_466569] dose of study drug and at all subsequent 
visits.  More frequent pregnancy  tests will be performed throughout the study  if required 
per local/country  requirements.
●If the baseline urine pregnancy  test performed at the site is negative, then 
dosing with study  drug may  begin.  If the baseline urine pregnancy  test 
performed at the site is positiv e, dosing with study drug must be withheld and 
a serum pregnancy  test is required.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to 
and performed b y the central laboratory.  If the serum pregnancy test is 
positive, study  drug must be permanently  discontinued.  In the event a 
pregnancy  test comes back borderline, a repeat test is required.
●If a urine pregnancy  test post baseline is positive, study  drug needs to be 
temporaril y discontinued and a serum pregnancy test is required.  The serum 
pregnancy  test will be sen t to and performed b y the central laboratory.  If the 
serum pregnancy  test is negative, study  drug may  be restarted.  If the serum 
pregnancy  test is positive, study  drug must be permanently  discontinued.
In Period 2, for women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy  test will be performed 
at all visits and monthly  at home between scheduled study  visits.  The results of the 
monthly  at home tests will be communicated to the site.  If a urine pregnancy  test is 
positive, the subject must stop dosing, retu rn to the study  site and have blood drawn for a 
serum pregnancy  test that will be analy zed at the central laboratory .
In the event a urine pregnancy  test may  not be performed at the protocol specified visits 
due to study  modifications related to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like 
COVID- 19, it can be performed by [CONTACT_277935] a local laboratory or it is possible for the 
Investigator to arrange a shipment from the study  site directly  to the subject 's home of  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466570] done at home (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] -Sub-Section "Study  Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance "for 
details). Home urine pregnancy  test should be performed monthly , regardless of ability  to 
obtain other laboratory  samples.
At each visit, the study  staff should review the pregnancy  avoidance recommendations 
with each subject of childbearing potential and male subjects receiving MTX with a 
partner of childbearing potential, and document this discussion in the subject 's source 
records.
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation as described in Section 5.2.4 is available, pregnancy  testing 
is no longer required.
A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation in this study  or be 
allowed to continue study drug.
Clinical L aboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained for the clinical laboratory tests listed in Table 2.  Unscheduled 
clinical labs may  be obtained at an y time d uring the study  if deemed appropriate per 
Investigator 's discretion.  A certified central laboratory  will be utilized to process and 
provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  All abnormal laboratory tests that are 
considered clinically  significan t by [CONTACT_176423] a satisfactory  
resolution.
The central laboratory  chosen for this study  will provide instructions regarding the 
collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_110965].

reference ranges and kept within the subjects 'source documentation.  L ocal lab results 
should be reviewed by  [CONTACT_372888].
If laboratory  samples cannot be obtained, study  drug administration may  be continued 
provided labs have been obtained within the prior [ADDRESS_466572] should be scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as fea sible and no 
later than the next scheduled visit in order to continue the study drug administration.
If laboratory  results are not available within the prior 3 months/two consecutive 12 -week 
intervals, study  drug dispensation is not allowed until the requi red laboratory  tests are 
completed to ensure the safet y assessments are conducted per protocol.
Blood samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests at visits specified in Appendix D
and Appendix F.  Blood draws should be performed only  after all questionnaires 
(HAQ -DI, Patient 's Assessment of Pain, etc.), clinical assessments, and vital sign 
determinations are obtained.
For clinic visits where samples for serum chemistry tests are collected, subjects should be 
fasting (a minimum [ADDRESS_466573]) whenever possible.  If a subject is not able to f ast when 
necessary , due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in 
study  source documentation.
Urine samples will be obtained for urinal ysis testing at visits specified in Appendix Dand 
Appendix F.  The central laboratory  will be responsible for performing a macro scopic 
urinaly sis (urine dipstick) on the collected urine specimens.  Specified abnormal 
macroscopic urinal yses defined as leukocy tes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater 
than negative, or glucose greater than normal will be followed up with a micr oscopic 
analysis at the central laboratory .

Hepatitis Screen
All subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV and HCV at Screening.
Hepatitis B:
Subjects will be test ed for the presence of HBV at Screening using the following tests:
●HBs Ag (Hepatitis B surface antigen)
●HBc Ab/anti -HBc (Hepatitis B core antibod y)
●HBs Ab/anti -HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody )
A positive result for HBs Ag will be exclusionary .
A negativ e result for HBs Ag will be tested (automatic reflex testing) for core antibodies 
(HBc Ab) and surface antibodies (HBs Ab).
●A negative test result for HBc Ab does notrequire HBV DNA PCR qualitative 
testing and the subject may be enrolled ( Figure 4, Scenarios A and B).
●For a subject who has had a HBV vaccination (should document in the medical 
history ), a positive test resul t for HBs Ab is expected and the subject may  be 
enrolled ( Figure 4, Scenario B).*
●A positive test result for HBc Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automatic 
reflex testing) ( Figure 4, Scenarios C and D).
○A positive result for HBV DNA or a result that exceeds detection 
sensitivity  will be exclusionary .
○A subject with a negative r esult for HBV DNA may  be enrolled.
●For subjects in Japan only:  A positive result for HBs Ab/anti -HBs requires 
HBV DNA PCR testing .
○A positive result for HBV DNA or a result that exceeds detection 
sensitivity  will be exclusionary .
○A subject with a negative result for HBV DNA may  be enrolled.

VZV ( For Subjects in Japan Only)
Tests for varicella -zoster virus (VZV) will be performed at Screening to evaluate 
immunity  of a subject to VZV for better understanding of the safet y profile of 
upadacitinib.
To assess the cell -mediated immune status to VZV, a skin test using the VZV antigen will 
be performed.  VZV antigen is injected intradermally into the forearm of each subject, and 
the longest diameters of erythema and edema will be measured in millimeters (mm) 
between 24 (recommended) and 48 hours after the injectio n and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page along with date and time of injection and measurement.  The 
absence of er ythema or edema will be recorded as "0 mm. "
Blood samples will be used for measuring IgG -class antibodies specific to VZV to 
estimate the prior exposure to VZV of the subject.
Randomization/Drug Assignment
All Screening laboratory  results must be reviewed, signed, and dated b y the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -investigator prior to the Baseline Visit.  Subjects will not be enrolled 
into the s tudy if laboratory  or other Screening result abnormalities are deemed clinically  
significant b y the Principal I nvestigator or Sub -investigator.
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria (Section 5.2) at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study .
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio using interactive response technology  (IRT)
to treatment Groups 2, 3, and 4, below, except for subjects from Japan, who will be 
randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4:
●Group 1:  Upadacitinib 7.5mg QD monotherap y (subjects in Japan only ;

Randomization will be stratified b y geographic region.
See Section 5.5.3 for details.
Study Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance
Study  drug(s) will be dispensed to subjects beginning at Baseline (Day  1) and as specified 
in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The first dose of study  drug(s) will be administe red after 
all other Baseline (Day  1) procedures are completed.  Subjects will maintain a dosing 
diary  for all study  drug(s) administered outside of the study  visit (i.e., at home) to capture 
dosing dates and times.  At visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F, the site 
personnel will review and retain a cop y of the dosing diary , returned stud y drug kits, and 
empty  study  drug packaging to verify  compliance.
To maintain the blind in this study  with two blinded investigational stud y drugs (MTX 
and upadacitinib), each subject will be instructed to take two capsules once weekl y (MTX 
and/or matching placebo) and a tablet once dail y (upadacitinib or matching placebo).  
MTX and matching placebo will be dis tributed as identical capsules to maintain blinding 
during the MTX titration and during the rest of the study .  Starting with Amendment 6 
subjects receiving MTX will receive open- label MTX tablets in quantities sufficient to 
cover their respective dose.
Determination of which subjects are assigned to receive MTX- placebo versus 
upadacitinib placebo will be via the IRT (Interactive Response Technology), which will 
randomly  assign each subject to the appropriate treatment group in a blinded manner.
All relevant dosing information will be entered into the eCRF at each visit.

[IP_ADDRESS] Collection and Handling of Optional Samples for 
Exploratory  Research and Validation Studies
In Period 1, subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory research and 
validation studies.  Subjects may  still participate in the study  even if they  decide not to 
participate in this optional exploratory  research/validation study .
Exploratory  resea rch can help to improve our understanding of how individuals respond 
to drugs and our ability  to predict which subjects would benefit from receiving specific 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In addition, exploratory  research may  help to improve our understanding of 
how to diag nose and assess/monitor RA by  [CONTACT_176428], outcomes data, and biomarkers of interest.
Validation studies, including those related to the development of potential in vitro 
diagnostic tests, may  be carried out retro spectively  in order to assess associations between 
events of interest (i.e., efficacy and/or safet y events) and candidate biomarkers.

[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding of Investigational Product
All [COMPANY_013] personnel with direct oversight conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception of [COMPANY_013] Drug Supply  Management Team), the Investigator, study  site 
personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject 's treatment throughout 
Period 1.
In order to maintain the blind, the upadacitinib and placebo tablets along with MTX and 
placebo capsules provided for the stud y will be identical in appearance.  The I RT will 
provide access to unblinded subjec t treatment information in the case of medical 
emergency .
In the event of a medical situation that requires unblinding of the stud y drug assignment, 
the Investigator is requested to contact [CONTACT_176439].  However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary  
which warrants breaking the blind prior to contact[CONTACT_176440], the Investigator can directl y access the I RT sy stem to break the blind 
without [COMPANY_013] n otification or agreement.  Unblinding is available in the IRT sy stem via 
the Unblind Subject transaction, which is available only to the Investigator.  If the IRT 
system is unavailable, unblinding may  occur b y contact[CONTACT_176441] (preferred) or email ([EMAIL_2197]).  For country -specific 
phone numbers, please see the following website:  http://www.endpointclinical.com/help-

[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding of Data for Data Monitoring Committee
An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprised of persons independent of 
[COMPANY_013] and with relevant expertise in their field will review unblinded safety data from 
the ongoing stud y.  The primary responsibility  of the DMC will be to protect the safet y of 
the subjects participating in this study .
A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the 
roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency  of data revi ews, and relevant 
safet y data to be assessed.
Communications from the DMC to the Study  Teams will not contain information that 
could potentially  unblind the team to subject treatment assignments.
As of September 2018, with all subjects having reached the end of Period 1, and after 
final review of unblinded safety data, the DMC concluded its oversight of this study .
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study  in accordance with 
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject dosing diary.  Subjects will be instructed to 
return all drug contai ners (even if empty ) to the study  site personnel at each clinic visit.  
The study  site personnel will document compliance in the study  source documents.
5.5.7 Drug A ccountability
The Investigator or his/her representative will verify that stud y drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by [CONTACT_176442] b y registering the arrival of drug through the  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466614] accountability  
including but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, 
subject number, and the identification of the person dispensing the drug.
All empty /used study  drug packaging will be inventoried by  [CONTACT_779].  Empty /used study  
drug packaging should be returned b y the subject at each visit for accountability  and 
compliance purposes and n ew packaging issued as necessary .  Site staff will complete 
study  drug accountabilit y via I RT by  [CONTACT_176444], subject dosing diaries, and 
by [CONTACT_372895].  After drug accountability  and 
monitor reconciliati on has been completed, used packaging and unused study  drug will be 
destroy ed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the 
destruction depot (for those sites that do not meet [COMPANY_013] 's documentation requirements 
for on -site destru ction).  The use of a third -party vendor for drug destruction must be pre -
approved b y [COMPANY_013].  For sites performing on -site drug destruction or using a third -party 
vendor for drug destruction, a cop y of the destruction methodology and date of 
destruction s hould be maintained at the site 's facility .
Site monitors will reconcile the site 's processes, source documents, subject 's dosing 
diaries, IRT or site accountability  records, and destruction records to assure site 
compliance.
5.6 Discussion and Justification o f Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
This multicenter study  includes two periods.  
Period 1 is a 48- week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, active 
comparator -controlled treatment period designed to compare the safe ty and efficacy  of 
upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD monotherap y (for subjects in Japan only), [ADDRESS_466615] superiority of upadacitinib versus MTX for achieving the 
primary  endpoint (the proportion of subjects achieving ACR50 response [US/FDA 
regulatory  purposes] or the proportion of subjects achieving CR [EU/EMA regulatory  
purposes] or ACR20 and change from baseline in mTSS [Japan/PMDA regulatory  
purposes]) at Week 24, and other secondary efficacy  parameters.
The purpose of Period 2 is to evaluate the long -term safet y, tolerability, and efficacy of 
upadacitinib (7.5, 15, or 30 mg QD) in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.  
All subjects will continue treatment to which they were a ssigned at the end of Period [ADDRESS_466616] visit of Period 1 (Week 48), stud y drug 
assignment in both periods may  be unblinded to the Sponsor and sites, and subjects would 
then be dispensed stud y drug in an open -label fashion until the completion of Period 2.
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib [ADDRESS_466617] 18 y ears of age with sy mptoms consistent with RA for ≥ 6 weeks who also fulfill 
the 2010 ACR/EUL AR classification criteria for RA and no prior or limit ed MTX 
treatment.  Eligible stud y subjects must have ≥ 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) 
and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and 
hsCRP ≥5 mg/L  (central lab, ULN 2.87 mg/L) at Screening.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
Three doses of the once -daily  formulation of upadacitinib will be evaluated:  upadacitinib 
7.5mg QD (subjects in Japan onl y), 15 mg QD, and 30 mg QD.  The dose selection in 
this study  is based on extrapolation of pre -clinical efficacy  models and analy ses of PK, 
pharmacod ynamic, safety, and efficacy data from the Phase 1 studies in healthy 
volunteers (single and multiple ascending dose Studies M13- 401 and M13 -845, 
respectivel y) and Phase 2 studies in RA subjects (Studies M13 -537 and M13 -550).  The 
doses selected for Study  M13 -545, upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD (for subjects in Japan only ), 
15mg QD, and 30 mg QD, dosed up to 2 60 weeks, are expected to be efficacious with an 
acceptable safet y profile.
Preliminary  results from an ongoing relative bioavailability  study  demonstrated that single 
15 mg and 30 mg doses of the once -daily formulation provide comparable AUC and 
significantl y lower C maxthan single doses of 12 mg immediate release formulation (AUC 
equivalent to 6 mg BID dose tested in Phase 2) and 24 mg immediate release formulation 
(AUC equivalent to 12 mg BID dose tested in Phase 2), respectivel y, under fasting 
conditions.  At steady -state, the once -daily  dose of [ADDRESS_466618]/device after it is released for

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have a 
causal relationshi p with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
the event is cons idered causally  related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in 
severit y of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and 
changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only  if they  result in discontinuation from 
study  drug, necessi tate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator 
considers them to be AEs.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during the study  will not be considered 
an AE if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condit ion and the 
surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the pre -existing 
condition deteriorates unexpectedly  during the study  (e.g., surgery  performed earlier than 
planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which th e elective surgery /procedure 
is being done will be considered an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
SAE within [ADDRESS_466621] 's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] .  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
result in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that sub stantially  
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly , or persistent or significa nt disability /incapacity ).  
Additionally , any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at 
home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse.

and sy mptoms of infection during and after treatment with study  drug.  Study  drug should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.  A 
subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study  drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As 
appropriate, antimicrobial therap y should be initiated, and the subject should be closel y 
monitored.  Re -challenge with study  drug may  occur once the infection has been 
successfull y treated.  Subjects who develop active TB must be discontinued from study 
drug.
COVID -19:  Interrupt study  drug in subjects with a confirm ed diagnosis of COVID -19.

embolus or non- cardiac, non -neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must
be discontinued from study  drug.
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ 
of the cervix must be discontinued from study drug.  Information including 
histopathologi cal results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic 
skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

the purpose of regulatory submission.  To maintain integrit y of the trial and avoid 
introduction of bias, study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of 
Period 1.  Additional unblinded anal yses may  be conducted after the W eek 24 anal ysis.
Completed and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully 
documented in the Statistical Anal ysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the 
database lock for the primary anal ysis at Week 24.  The stati stical anal yses will be 
performed using SAS (SAS I nstitute Inc., Cary , NC, [LOCATION_003]).
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will 
receive open- label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Starting with Amendment 6 subjects

[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  Analysis for Period 1
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Primary  Efficacy  Variables
The primary  endpoints for US/FDA, EU/EMA, and Japan/PMDA regulatory  purposes are 
listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .  Analy ses will be conducted separatel y for US/FDA, EU/EMA 
and Japan/PMDA regulatory  purposes; for each set of anal yses, onl y the specified primary 
endpoint is applicable.
The anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be conducted on the FAS based on 
treatment as randomized.  Supportive analysis will also be conducted on the Per Protocol 
Analy sis Set.  For the analy sis of ACR20, ACR50 and CR, the comparisons will be made 
between each upadacitinib dose and the MTX group using the Cochran -Mantel- Haens zel 
test adjusting for main stratification factors.  Non -Responder Imputation (NRI ) will be 
used as the primary  anal ysis.  For the analysis of change from baseline in mTSS, between -
group comparisons for each upadacitinib treatment group and the MTX treatme nt group 
will be performed using the anal ysis of covariance model with treatment group as the 
fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the 
covariates.  Both linear extrapolation analy sis and as observed anal ysis will be conducted.
The primary  efficacy  analyses will be performed in demographic subgroups including age, 
gender, weight, bod y mass index, race, and geographical region to assess the consistency 
of the treatment effect.  Additional subgroup analyses based on baseline disease 
characteristics and stratification factors will also be conducted.

treatment group and the MTX treatment group will be performed using the anal ysis of 
covariance model with treatment groups as the fixed factor, and the corresponding 
baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates.

(excluding the Japan specific upadacitinib 7.5 mg treatment group), the overall type I 
error rate of the primary  and ranked key  secondary  endpoints for the two doses will be 
strongl y controlled using a graphical multiple testing procedure.23  Specifically , the testing 
will utilize the endpoint sequence of primary  endpoint(s) followed by  [CONTACT_372901] [IP_ADDRESS].2, and will begin with 
testing the primary  endpoint using α of 0.[ADDRESS_466653] 2015 -003334 -27

[IP_ADDRESS].5 Imputation Methods
The following methods will be used for missi ng data imputation:
Observed Cases (OC):   The OC anal ysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, 
and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded 
from the OC anal ysis for that visit.
Multiple Imputation (MI):  The M I anal ysis imputes missing data multiple times under 
appropriate random variation and thus generate multiple im puted "pseudo -complete "
datasets.  Results will be aggregated across the multiple imputed datasets, overcoming 
drawbacks of the single imputation methods .
Non- Responder Imputation (NRI):   NRI applies to binary  endpoints only.  I n NRI 
analysis, subjects who prematurel y discontinue study drug will be considered 
non-responders after discontinuation.
Linear Extrapolation for Radiographic Data:   For radiographic data (i.e., mTSS -based 
endpoints), if a subject receives rescue therap y or prematurel y discontinued, the 
radiographic data at time points after rescue or discontinuation will be imputed assuming 
a linear relationsh ip between baseline and previous time point when X -ray should be 
collected. 
For non -radiographic data, the NRI approach will serve as the primary  analy sis approach 
for key  binary  endpoints.  The MI approach will serve as the primary  anal ysis approach 
for key continuous endpoints.  Sensitivity  anal ysis based on OC will also be conducted for 
key endpoints.  For radiographic data, anal ysis based on both linear extrapolation and an 
as-observed anal ysis (where the as -observed Week 24/48 assessments for all subj ects are 
used) will be conducted.

Safety  anal yses will be carried out using the Safety  Analy sis Set.  Anal yses will be 
conducted for Period 1 alone, as well as for Period 1 and Period 2 combined.
Safety  analyses are based on treatments actuall y received.  Safet y will be assessed by  [CONTACT_2695], 
physical examination, laboratory  assessments, ECG, and vital signs.  Frequency  tables

clinical laboratory values will be anal yzed in a descriptive manner.  Shift of laboratory  
values from baseline to defined time points will be tabulated.
Missing safet y data will not be imputed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Adverse Events
Unless otherwise specified, the following conventions apply for both the Period 1 safet y 
analysis and the combined safet y analysis of Period 1 and Period 2.

●Frequent reasonabl y possibly  related AEs (reported in 5% of subjects or more 
in any  treatment group);
●Discontinuations due to A Es;
●Death.
Additional AEs may be considered for tabulation/summary based on recommendations 
from Clinical and Safet y as deemed appropriate.
TEAEs will be summarized and presented b y system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred

NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version).  The structure of the starting PK 
model will be based on the PK anal ysis of data from previous studies.  The CL /F and V/F 
of upadacitinib will be the PK paramet ers of major interest in the anal yses.  If necessary, 
other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be 
fixed if useful in the analysis.
The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of 
different models.
1. The objective function of the best model is significantly  smaller than the alternative 
model(s).
2. The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more 
randomly  distributed across the line of unity  (a straight line with zero intercept and 
a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
3. Visual inspection of model fits standard errors of model parameters and change in 
inter-subject and intra -subject error.
Once an appropriate base PK model (including inter -and intra -subject error structure) is 
developed, empi[INVESTIGATOR_372878] b y the posterior conditional estimation technique using non -linear 
mixed -effects modeling.  The relationship between these conditional est imates CL /F and 
V/F values with onl y potentially ph ysiologicall y relevant or clinically meaningful 
covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory 
markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using ste pwise forward 
selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level 
of 0.05.  After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of 
covariates from the full model will be employ ed to evaluat e the significance (at P < 0.005, 
corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of 
each covariate in the full model.

Linear or non -linear relationships of primary  PK parameters with various covariates will 
be explored.
Relationships between upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary efficacy 
variable) will be explored.  Exposure -response relationships for secondary  efficacy  
variables and/or some safety  measures of interest may  also be explored.  The relati onship 
between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area 
under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model- predicted PK profiles, or 
some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored.  Several 
classes of models (e.g., linear, log -linear, exponential, E max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be 
evaluated to characterize the exposure -response relationship based on observed data.  
Results of the PK and exposure -response analy ses may  be summarized in a separate report 
prior to regulatory  filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of RA, rather than in the CSR.
Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The planned sample size of 900 (not including the Ja pan specific upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD 
treatment group) provides at least 90% power for a 20% difference in ACR50 response 
rate (assuming a Week 12 MTX ACR50 rate of 20%).  This sample size also provides at 
least 90% power for a 16% difference in DAS28 CR response rate (assuming a Week 24 
MTX CR rate of 24%), and for a 20% difference in ACR20 response rate (assuming a 
Week 12 MTX ACR20 rate of 50%).  With this sample size, there is approximately  80% 
power to detect a difference of 0.58 in change from baseline in mTSS (assuming a 
standard deviation of 2.2).  This sample size will also provide at least 90% power for 
other ranked key  secondary  endpoints including change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP), 
change from baseline in HAQ- DI, ACR70, and SF -36.  The above powe r calculations are 
all based on a two -sided significance level of 0.025 and accounting for a 10% dropout rate.  
An additional 75 Japanese subjects will be enrolled into the Japan specific upadacitinib 
7.5 mg QD treatment arm for Japan/PMDA regulatory  purpo ses.

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol amendments, the 
Investigator 's Brochure, the informed consent, and all other forms of subject information 
related to the stud y (e.g ., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and an y other necessary 
documents be reviewed by [CONTACT_18369]/I RB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific 
and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the 
protocol, informed consent, and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will 
be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study  site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/I RB approval prior to implementation 
of an y changes made to the study  design.  The investigator will be required to submit,  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466661] 2015 -003334 -27
141
maintain and archive study  essential documents according to International Conference on 
Harmonization (I CH) GCP.
Any SAEs that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by  [CONTACT_427], will be 
reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required b y 
local regulations.  During the conduct of the stud y, the I nvestigator should promptly  
provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and an y additional r eports required 
by [CONTACT_427]) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that affect the conduct of the study  
and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the 
IEC/IRB should also be provided to [COMPANY_013].
9.[ADDRESS_466662] their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities o f the clinical 
investigator are specified in Appendix A.
In the event a significant disaster/crisis (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]/pandemic, natural disaster, 
conflict/combat) occurs leading to difficulties in performing protocol -specified procedures, 
[COMPANY_013] may  engage with study  site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of subjects, 
maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrit y of the stud y while 
trying to best manage subject continuity  of care.  This may  include alternative methods for 
assessments (e.g., virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection (e.g., use of a 
local lab instead of a central lab), and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_100638]/or supplies 
direct to subjects to ensure continuity  of treatment where allowed.  In all cases, these 
alternative measures must be allowed b y local regulations and permitted by I RB/IEC.  
Investigators should notify [COMPANY_013] if an y urgent safet y measures are taken to protect the 
subjects against an y immediate hazard. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466663] Information and Consent
The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to an y stud y-related 
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the 
informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A cop y of 
the informed consent will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject' s medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject 's dated source 
documents to confirm that informed consent was obtaine d prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participati on 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent.
Samples for exploratory  research/validation studies will only  be collected if the subject 
has voluntarily  signed and dated the separate written consent for exploratory 
research/validation studies, approved b y an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has 
been explained and the subject has had an opportunity  to ask questions.  The separate 
written consent must be signed before the exploratory research/validation studies samples 
are collected and testing is performed.  The separate written consent may  be part of the 
main consent form.  If the subject does not consent to the exploratory research/validation 
studies, it will not impact the subject' s participation in the study .
In the event a subject withdraw s from the main study , optional exploratory  research 
samples will continue to be stored and anal yzed unless the subject specifically  withdraws 
consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the 
subject must inform the ir study  doctor, and once [COMPANY_013] is informed, the optional 
samples will be destro yed.  However, if the subject withdraws his/her consent and the 
samples have alread y been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall 
research data.

contraception (one highly  effective m ethod combined with one effective method, 
refer to Contraception Recommendations for Females below) that are effective 
from Study  Day  [ADDRESS_466684] dose of stud y drug.
11. Male subjects who are sexually  active with female partner(s ) of childbearing 
potential must agree from Study  Day  [ADDRESS_466685] dose of study  
drug to practice the protocol -specified contraception (refer to Contraception 
Recommendations for Males below ).
Section 5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilat eral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176366] h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more m onths without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL.
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.   
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466686] 2015 -003334 -27
157
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified cont raception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.  
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required and a serum pregn ancy  test must be performed (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 m onths are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to use two forms of 
contraception.  This includes one form of highl y effective contraception and one effective 
method of contraception that are effective from Study  Day 1 (or earlier) through at least 
[ADDRESS_466687] dose of study  drug.
●Highl y effective methods:
○Hormonal contraceptives started at least 2 months prior to randomization 
(e.g., combined [estr ogen and progestogen containing] oral contraceptives, 
patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants);
○Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine s ystem (IUS);
○Vasectom y and tubal ligation.
●Effective methods: 
○Barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male condom, female condom, 
cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge). 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_466688] 2015 -003334 -27
158
○Note:  The proper use of diaphragm or cervical cap includes use of 
spermicide and is considered one barrier method.  The cervical cap and 
contraceptive sponge are less effective in parous women.  The use of 
spermicide alone is not considered a suitable barrier method for 
contraception.  When used consistently  and correctly , "double barrier "
methods of contraception (e.g., male condom with diaphragm, male 
condom with cervical cap) can be us ed as an effective alternative to the 
highl y effective contraception methods described above.  Male and female 
condoms should not be used together as they can tear of become damaged.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requir ements for male subjects receiving upadacitinib only , or 
their female partner(s).  
For a male subject receiving MTX who has a female partner who is postmenopausal or 
permanentl y sterile, no contraception is required.
A male subject receiving MTX who is se xually  active with female partner(s) of 
childbearing potential must agree from Study  Day  [ADDRESS_466689] dose 
of MTX study  drug to practice contraception with:
●Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the highly  effective 
contraceptive methods as defined in the protocol for female stud y subjects of 
childbearing potential .
Additionally , male subjects receiving MTX must agree not to donate sperm from Study  
Day [ADDRESS_466690] dose of MTX study  drug. 
Male subjects receiving MTX are responsible for informing his partner(s) of the risk of 
becoming pregnant and for reporting an y pregnancy  to the study  doctor.

of childbearing pote ntial and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alt ernative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least [ADDRESS_466694] dose of study drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation, initiated at least [ADDRESS_466695] 2015 -003334 -27
160
●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received 
medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of 
the women of childbearing potential trial participant.
●Intrauterine d evice (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
A second form of contraception (barrier) such as a male or female condom with or 
without spermicide OR cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in 
addition to one of the highly  effec tive birth control methods listed above.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requirements for male subjects receiving upadacitinib only , or 
their female partner(s).  
For a male subject receiving MTX who has a female partner w ho is postmenopausal or 
permanentl y sterile, no contraception is required.
A male subject receiving MTX who is sexually  active with female partner(s) of 
childbearing potential must agree from Study  Day  [ADDRESS_466696] dose 
of MTX study  drug to practice contraception with:
●Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the contraceptive 
measures (as defined in the protocol for female study subjects of childbearing 
potential).
Additionally , male subjects receiving MTX must agree not to donate sperm from Study  
Day [ADDRESS_466697] 2015 -003334 -27
161
Male subjects receiving MTX are responsible for informing his partner(s) of the risk of 
becoming pregnant and for reporting an y pregnancy  to the study  doctor.

a. Subjects may withdraw from the study completely (withdrawal of informed consent) or may discontinue study drug treatment, but may choose to continue to participate in the 
study (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  If a subject is prematurely discontinued from study drug, the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit 
(PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of study drug discontinuation.
b. The Baseline Visit procedures will serve as the reference for all subsequent visits with the exception of the ECG and x -rays of hands and feet, which will be obtained at 
Screening only and used as the baseline reference (see also footnote l regarding x -rays of the hands and feet at Screening).
c. This visit is [ADDRESS_466703] dose of study drug for those subjects who prematurely disconti nue from study drug and study participation.  A 30 -day follow -up phone call may 
occur for subjects who prematurely discontinued from study drug and study participation to determine the status of any ongoin g AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new 
AEs/SAEs.  
d. Informed consent should be obtained at Screening prior to performing any study related procedures.
e. Also note herpes zoster and hepatitis B vaccination status in medical history.  
f. Collect serious adverse events and protocol -related nonserious AEs that occur after a subject signs the informed consent, prior to the first dose of study drug.
g. At Week 48 (after Week [ADDRESS_466704] been performed), per Investigator judgment, may add csDMARDs (concomitant use of u p to 2 csDMARDs, except the 
combi nation of MTX and leflunomide), or increasing csDMARD dose.
h. Prior to other procedures.  For morning stiffness, duration will be captured only if NRS rating is > 0.
i. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures TB Testing for specific requirements for TB testing and TB prophylaxis.  QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (and/or [COMPANY_003] skin test) is not 
required at the PD visit.

chest x -ray is not required at the PD visit.
k. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required, provided al l sou rce documentation is available.  Refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] 12-Lead ECG for additional details.  All subjects will have an ECG at Week [ADDRESS_466706] be performed during the screening process.  Subjects are eligible for the study if the locally re ad screening x -rays confirms the presence of 
≥ 1bone erosion OR in the absence of the documented bone erosion, both positive RF and positive anti -CCP autoantibodies are required.  Screening x -rays will serve as 
baseline x-rays for scoring purposes.  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures X -Rays of Hands and Feet for additional details.
m. For handling of x -rays during the study, please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
n. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_176383].
o. A full physical exam is r equired at the visits indicated.  A symptom -directed physical exam may be performed when necessary.
p. For all women of childbearing potential, collect serum for pregnancy test at screening.  If serum pregnancy test comes back b orderline, a repeat test is necessary (pregnancy is 
an exclusion criterion).  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
q. For all women of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits.  If urine pregnancy test ( which is performed at the site) is 
negative, begin or continue dosing.  If urine pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and pe rform a serum pregnancy test.  Pregnant subjects must permanently discontinue 
study drug.  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
r. Central lab hsCRP results will remain blinded to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and subject for all visits except Screening.  Results of tests such as hsCRP 
may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, th ereby [CONTACT_372890] a possible safety assessment or adverse event management . 
Any local hsCRP or local CRP tests should not be reported to the investigator until treatment allocation is unblinded.
s. Minimu m 8-hour fast.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.
t. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by [CONTACT_17206].  A microscopic analysis will be performed in the event the dipstick 
results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.
u. If required by [CONTACT_372906], subjects will be tested for antibodies to HIV at Screening, and it should be documented that the test has 
been performed.  This testing is to be done at a local lab.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test r esults indicate a positive HIV infection.  [COMPANY_013] will not 
receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result.

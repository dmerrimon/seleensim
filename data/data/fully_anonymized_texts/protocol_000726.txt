 1 Synopsis  
Purpose  
SARS- CoV-2 is a coronavirus that emerged in China in late 2019  causing a novel 
Co
 rona- Virus Induced Disease (COVID -19).  COVID -[ADDRESS_29417] sufficiently 
severe symptoms to require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30056], in 
others  the disease may remain mild, and in some cases  there has been observed a 
worsening of symptoms a few days after initial presentation with relatively mild 
symptoms.  T here is an urgent need for understanding the progression of disease for 
individuals with SARS- CoV-2 infection/ COVID -19 who do not requir e immediate 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].    
This is a n international, observational cohort study  of adults  with SARS -CoV-2 
infection/COVID -19 managed as outpatients (not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15583]) .  This study will also be 
a platform for the enrolment of outpatients  for randomized trials  that will be  conducted 
by [CONTACT_30094].    
Those with confirmed SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_29418] been streamlined to 
facilitate the enrolment of a large number of adults at INSIGHT sites around the world.      
 
The general aim of this study is to estimate the rate of disease progression for adults  
testing positive f or SARS -CoV-2.  The primary endpoint for this study and the basis for 
sample size is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30057] 28 day follow -up period.  In some 
locations s pecial facilities are being built/utilized for quarantine/public health reasons for 
those who are SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_29419] 18 
hours , irrespective of reason,  at a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30058] . 
 Secondary outcomes include participant -reported health status and change in severity 
of dyspnoea.  
 As the understanding of the natural history of COVID -19 improves based on this and 
other studies, inclusion criteria and the data collection plan, including the outcomes assessed in  this protocol , may be modified.   
 Study Obj ectives 
The two primary objectives of this observational study are:  
 Among participants testing positive  for SARS- CoV-2: 
 
1. Estimate the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30057] 28 day follow -up period.  
2. Identify risk factors for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059].   
 
Other objectives are:  
INSIGHT 0 11: COVID -[ADDRESS_29420].  
 
2. Among those positive  for SARS- CoV-2: 
 
a. Evaluate health status and the percentage re porting  excellent or very 
good health status during follow -up. 
 
b. Deter mine the percentage reporting a return to premorbid health status 
during follow -up. 
 
c. Evaluate change in severity of dyspnoea  using a standardized 
questionnaire during follow -up.  
 
3. In a substudy involving selected sites, establish a repository of baseline upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_30060] .  These s tudies will be aimed 
at molecular characteriz ation of SARS -CoV-2, and the measurement of 
biomarkers  that predict progression of disease.  Among participants co- enroling 
in INSIGHT 004: Genomic s, DNA will be extracted for studies of host genetics 
to investigate the pathophysiology and host -viral interactions of COVID -19. 
 4. Use the  data collected to inform  the design of future randomized intervention 
studies aimed at  reducing the rate of  disease progression and morbidity .   
 Participant Selection  
To be eligible for enrolment participants must be ≥ 18 years of age, not be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] 
(outpatients ), and have a signed informed consent .  Participants with SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_29421] SARS- CoV-2 infection/ COVID -19, will 
be followed for [ADDRESS_29422] been streamlined to facilitate the enrolment of a large number of adults at INSIGHT sites around the world.   
 The general aim of this study is to identify risk factors for disease progression, e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059].  This information will be used to plan and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_30061] -19.  Protocols which are developed for the 
randomized trials by [CONTACT_30095].

 2 Background and Rationale  
In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of 
viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause.  A novel coronavirus was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_30062]  2 (SARS- CoV-
2), and the illness caused by [CONTACT_30096] -CoV-2 has been named Corona Virus 
Induced Disease 2019 (COVID -19).  By [CONTACT_30097] [ADDRESS_29424] a 
lower fatality rate than previous coronaviruses like MERS and SARS -CoV-1, it is more 
contagious .5  Current estimates of the fatality rate range from 0.5 to 3.5% overall 
(versus 0.1% for seasonal influenza), and are likely higher in key risk groups including 
the immunocompr omised.  
Reports to date have focussed largely on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30063].  Older age has been found to be strongly related to greater severity and poorer outcome,
7,12,[ADDRESS_29425] notably been associated with greater likelihood of progression to more severe disease include shortness of breath and elevated body  temperature .
7,9   
 Data on the relationship between the use of routine medications for chronic conditi ons 
and COVID -19 outcomes are limited.  It has been hypothesized that since the tissue 
receptor for SARS- CoV-2 is angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ), and higher  levels 
of ACE2 can protect against acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] ( ARDS), that the 
angiotensin receptor blockers and statins  upregulate ACE2 and that these might be 
used to treat COVID -19.
20  On the other hand, it has also been suggested that 
treatment with  ACE2 -stimulating drugs in people with diabetes  and hypertension could 
increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_30064] -19.21
10  One small study has 
found no association between use of an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor or 
angiotensin II receptor blocker  and risk of death in COVID -19.     
 There is currently little data available in people with COVID -19 who are managed as 
outpatients .  It would be useful to identify risk  factors  associated with progression of 
COVID -19 in non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30065]/or 
INSIGHT 0 11: COVID -[ADDRESS_29426] will 
not be follow ed after enrolment  or disclosure of a negative result .  
3.2 Study Objectives  
The two primary objectives of this observational study are:  
 Among those who are positive for  SARS- CoV-2: 
 
1. Estimate the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30057] 2 8 day follow -up period.  
 
2. Identify risk factors for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059].   
 
Other objectives are:  
 
INSIGHT 0 11: COVID -[ADDRESS_29427] progression of di sease.  Among participants co- enroling 
in INSIGHT 004: Genomics, DNA will be extracted for studies of host genetics to investigate the pathophysiology and host -viral interactions of COVID -19. 
 
4. Use the data collected to inform the design of future randomized intervention studies aimed at reducing the rate of disease progression and morbidity .

at a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30066] .  
 Key secondary outcomes include:  
• Participant -reported evaluation of health status  
• Change in severity of dyspnoea.  
3.4 Sample Size  
Sample size is open- ended for this observational study.  We estimate that several 
hundred sites will participate and will enrol approximately  10,000 adults with SARS-
CoV-2 infection.  Sites in diverse geographic locations on several continents will 
participate.  
 For participants with C OVID -19, statistical considerations are summarized below.  
Information on rates of a composite outcome of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30067] 0 11: COVID -[ADDRESS_29429] 2020 
 6 
 population is scarce, and rates are expected to vary across geographic locations, and 
possibly over time.  Therefore, initial analyses will be descriptive, and sample size 
estimates will be updated based on the observed event rates, prevalence of risk factors, and newly emerging r esearch questions.  
 For power calculations, we conservatively assume that 500 out of 10,000 (5%) participants will experience the composite outcome of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30068] 
28.  This is based on the expectation that persons with mild symptoms wil l be 
discouraged from seeking SARS -CoV-2 testing at the height of the pandemic, while 
persons presenting with severe symptoms would not be eligible for this protocol.  
 Table 1 below summarizes the sizes of the associations of risk factors (dichotomized) with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059] (odds ratios) that can be detected with 80% and 90% 
power, using 2- sided tests with significance level of 0.05, assuming 500 or 100 events. 
For example, with 500 events, an odds ratio of 1.51 can be detected with 80% power for a risk factor with 10% prevalence.  For analyses within subgroups, e.g., by [CONTACT_654], 
event numbers may be smaller.  With 100 events, an odds ratio of 2.32 can be 
detected with 80% power  for a risk factor with 10% prevalence .

outcomes is positive (odds ratio > 1) or negative (odds ratio < 1).  For example, with 
[ADDRESS_29431] deviation higher levels of the risk factor can be detected with 9 0% power.  Calculations assume t hat the risk factor has a 
normal distribution.

 3.5 Participant Selection  
This study intends to target enrolment at research sites that can recruit a large number 
of individuals  with SARS- CoV-2.  Thus, e ach participating site will be asked to 
describe the approach they plan to take for enroling individuals.  Site s may be asked 
to change their approach to enrolment if the expected percentage positive for SARS -
CoV-2 is too low.   Enrollm ent at registered sites may be paused if there are too few 
positive individuals being enroled . 
 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolment are given below.       
3.5.1  Inclusion Criteria

Outpatient testing for SARS -CoV-2 may be performed in a variety of ways  and for a 
variety of reasons .  To avoid risk to health care workers, in many locations, special 
facilities are b eing identified for rapid identification of those with COVID -19.  We refer to 
these as “testing stations”.  Since the testing stations are likely to be overwhelmed with 
people seeking testing, we anticipate that separate areas will have to be identified to consent participants for this research study and to collect the required data.  We refer to these as “research stations”.  Collaborations between the testing and research stations will be important.    Enrolment  
 For participants who consent to the study, permission to release medical records will be sought and reasons for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30071].   Information regarding demographics; medical history, including co-
morbidities; onset date of symptoms; targeted sympto ms, including difficulty breathing ; 
smoking; and targeted medications will be obtained.  Contact [CONTACT_30098] (s) the participant ’s whereabouts will also be recorded.   
 At the time of enrolment , selected sites participating in a substudy (see Appendix F) will 
be asked to obtain separate consent  for the swabs from the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_30072] 
a blood sample sufficient for 4mL of serum to be shipped to a central repository for 
future respi[INVESTIGATOR_30073]; and 2) co-enrolment  in the INSIGHT Genomics Study 
(INSIGHT 004)  where a blood sample sufficient for obtaining [ADDRESS_29438] result for SARS -CoV-2 at enrolment  will not 
be followed.   Repeat testing can be carried out following local guidelines.    
 
Follow -up of SARS- CoV-2 positive participants  
INSIGHT 0 11: COVID -[ADDRESS_29439] 2020

 During the follow -up period, the status of each participant will be assessed at 7, 14 and 
28 days  following enrolment .  Status may be checked by [CONTACT_30099]- to-face visits (e.g., text messages).   
 
Follow -up assessments at 7, 14 and 28 days  will include:  
 
• Vital status  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30074]  
• Specific  symptoms , including difficulty breathing  
• General health status  
• COVID -19 related out -patient treatments  
• Targeted medications   
 
Participant s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30075] 28 day follow -up period may be invited to participate 
in FLU 003 Plus , if the location of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] i s a FLU 003 Plus site.  
 In summary, there are 4 time points at which data are collected for this observational 
study:  
 1) enrolment (in person) ,  
2) at day 7 (may be by [CONTACT_30100] ), 
3) at day 14 (may be by [CONTACT_30100] ) and  
4) at day 28 (may be by [CONTACT_30100] ). 
 Follow -up will continue through day 28 for all participants regardless of enrolment in 
other studies or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30076] 28.  
 Figure 2 illustrates how information from the observational cohort study could be used 
to identify  participants for an INSIGHT  clinical trial or for  FLU 003  Plus.

INSIGHT 0 11: COVID -[ADDRESS_29441] will be identified using logistic regression models.  Factors other than 
symptoms include, for example, age, sex, co- morbidities , and time since onset of 
symptoms . 
 For participants who tested positive for SARS -CoV-2, follow -up data will be collected 
at days 7, 14, and 28.  Disease severity at each time point will be summarized in an 
ordinal outcome that considers death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and general health status.  
 Risk factors for the outcomes  (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], worsening of general health status) 
at 7, 14, and 28 days after enrolment will be examined using logistic regression models.  Reasons for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30077].   Risk factors will include demographic 
factors (e.g., age, sex, geographical region), clinical factors (e.g., co- morbidities, 
smoking status), symptoms and severity of dyspnoea at enrolment, and calendar time 
(to assess the influence of s eason, or a change in disease severity in the study 
population over time).   
  
In addition to describing disease status at fixed time points, Kaplan- Meier estimates 
will be used to describe time to the composite outcome of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30078] h, 
overall  and within subgroups.  Factors associated with time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30079].  
 All statistical models will be stratified by [CONTACT_1617], unless the event numbers are too low.  We will consider other stratifying models that include stratification by 
[CONTACT_30101].  
 As new data on COVID -19 become available, from this and other studies, data 
collection and analysis may change to address emerging research questions.   Further 
details on the proposed data analysis will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan.

For those consenting to collection and storage of specimens, t he risks of having blood 
taken include transient pain, bleeding, bruising, lightheadedness, fainting and , rarely , 
infection or a blood clot where the needle enters the body.  If any adverse events occur that result from the blood draw or the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_30080], sites should follow local 
IRB/IEC procedures for reporting.  
5.2 Local Review of Protocol and Informed Consent  
This study will be conducted by [CONTACT_30102].  Prior to the initiation of the study at each clinical researc h site, the protocol, informed consent 
form, and the participant information materials will be submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_25733]’s overseeing IRB/EC .  Any future amendments to the study protocol , informed 
consent, or participant information materials will be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_25733]’s overseeing IRB/EC .  After IRB/EC approval, sites must register for the protocol

 F-1 APPENDIX F:   SPECIMEN COLLECTION SUBSTUDY  
 
Objective 
The objective of the sub- study is to:  
1. Establish a repository of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_30088].  
These specimens  will be used for future research  aimed at molecularly characterizing 
the virus, including genetic analysis, and the measurement of biomarkers that predict 
progression of disease.  For those who sign an additional consent for the INSIGHT Genomics Study (INSIGHT 004), DNA will be extracted for studies of host genetics to investigate the pathophysiology of COVID -19. 
 Rationale  
This sub- study will run alongside the main study but will additionally include  the 
collection of baseline upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_30089] . To avoid the 
collection of a large number of stored samples from SARS -CoV-2 negative 
participants , selected sites participating in this sub- study will be activated  when a 
relative ly large number of those enroled are positive  or enrolment strategies permit 
enrolment of large numbers of individuals who are positive.   
 Methodology  
At the time of enrolment , alongside consent for the main study sites participating in the 
sub-study will be asked to obtain separate consents for : 
 
1) Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_30090] a central repository for 
future research on COVID; and  
 
2) at those sites registered for the INSIGHT Genomics Study (INSIGHT 004), a whole 
blood  sample .   
 
These specimens will be sent to a central repository in the [LOCATION_002] for storage.

[The following text box is required for sites in the US, in accordance with the 2018 
Common Rule.]  
 
 
 What do you have to do in the study?  
If you agree, we will swab your nose and/ or throat . If you are also being tested for 
COVID -[ADDRESS_29472] up to 3 nose and/or 
throat swabs. We will also take blood from a vein in your arm using a needle.  We will 
take about 2 -4 teaspoons  of blood.  We will store the blo od with the swab samples .  
We will not do any tests on these  samples right now.  
 What are the risks or discomforts of having samples taken?  
We will insert a new, clean needle into a vein in your arm to take blood.  You may feel a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30091].  You may get a bruise where the 
needle was put in.  You may also have swelling, and the area may be sore.  These 
things are common and should go away in a couple of days.  There is a very small 
chance of an infection where blood is drawn.  An infection could be treated with 
antibiotics.  
 Having your nose and/ or throat swab sample s taken will be uncomfortable.  It may 
cause you to gag  or sneeze.  KEY INFORMATION  
• If you have agreed to be in the COVID -[ADDRESS_29473] 1- 2 additional swab samples, and a blood sample taken, you 
can be in this study.  
• Once you have given your samples, you are done with this study.  You will still be followed in the COVID- 19 Observation study.  
• Your samples will be sent to a laborator y in the [LOCATION_002] for 
storage.  They will be used in the future to learn more about COVID -19 
and the virus that causes it.  
• There is no direct benefit to you from being in this study.  You will help us learn more about how COVID -19 affects people like you.  
• The extra swab samples can be taken from the nose and/or throat. Both types of swab can be a little uncomfortable but only for a short time. Also, the throat swab may make you gag. The nose swab may make you sneeze. The blood sample will be taken from  your arm using a 
needle.  This will hurt a little bit and may leave a bruise where the needle goes in.  
• You do not have to be in this study.  If you agree to be in this study, you can decide at any time to ask that your samples be destroyed.  This will 
not change your medical care or other benefits.

What are the benefits of having samples taken?  
There  is no benefit to you of having samples taken.  These samples may help us learn 
more about COVID -19 and SARS -CoV-2 and how it affects people, which may help 
other people in the future.  
 What will happen to your samples?  
Your  stored samples will be marked  with your study code and not with your name. 
Only research investigators at the site where you are receiving care can link the code 
to your name.  
 Your samples will be kept at your site for now  and periodically  shipped to a specimen 
repository  in the United  States.  They will be kept there for an indefinite amount of time 
to be used for research in the future.  
 No human  genetic testing will be done on your samples.  Your samples  will not be 
sold.  You will not be paid for any products that might result from this research.  
 The only risk of allowing us to store your samples would be an accidental release of 
your identity . 
 Some of the samples will be used along with your information collected in the COVID-
19 Observation study (identified only by [CONTACT_30123]) for future research.  You will 
not be told about the future research.   Future  research with your samples may help us 
understand how the SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_29475] to follow your wishes but cannot promise that we will always be 
able to destroy your samples.  For example, if your samples  were  already used, we 
would not be able to destroy them, and we would keep any information that had already been taken from the samples.  
 How will your privacy be protected?  
In the consent form you signed for the COVID -[ADDRESS_29476] any information about you and will only see that code number on your 
INSIGHT 0 11: COVID -[ADDRESS_29477] any 
information about you.   
 
INSIGHT, the group that is doing this study, may share your information and samples with other people who study COVID -19 and SARS -CoV-2.  Your study code will be 
removed before sharing  your data.  This is called “anonymizing the data” .  We will not 
ask you for additional consent for this sharing.  Information and samples will only be shared for research projects that are approved by [CONTACT_30124].   
 What if you are hurt as part of this research?  
We do not expect any harm from giving samples.    
 What if you have questions? If you have questions about this study, or about the storage or use of your samples, 
you can contact (site PI [INVESTIGATOR_30085]).  If you have questions about your

hypothesis is that antiangiogenic therapy works to “normalize” the disrupted vasculature 
of tumors, resulting in increased drug delivery.15,[ADDRESS_665663] not yielded useful markers to define the population of patients that may

generate energy in low nutrient and/or oxygen-poor environments.22,23  Autophagy is a 
m
ulti-step process that involves the vesicular sequestration of cytoplasmic proteins and 
damaged organelles into a structure called the autophagic vesicle (AV). AVs fuse with 
lysosomes and AV contents are degraded by [CONTACT_459262]-dependent enzymes. This process is 
activated by [CONTACT_513710], 
hypoxia, chemotherapy, and radiation.[ADDRESS_665665] performed multiple Phase I trials that all show combinations of cytotoxic drugs 
with therapeutic doses of HCQ to be tolerable.  We performed a Phase I/II trial of the 
combination of HCQ and FOLFOX/bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer.  Eligible patients had Stage IV colorectal cancer, with no prior therapy for 
metastatic disease, good PS (0,1), and adequate hematologic and biochemical indices.  
We entered 16 patients in the Phase I portion, 6M/10F, median age 57.5, and PS 0 (9) or 
1 (7).  One patient had received prior adjuvant treatment [ADDRESS_665666] and pulmonary embolism and four patients with grade 3 
neutropenia. The adverse events were not thought to be related to the addition of 
hydrochloroquine to FOLFOX and bevacizumab. In all cohorts, 44% of patients had 
partial response, 37% had stable disease, and 19% had progressive disease.  We

with HCQ 600mg PO BID continuously. 
 
We continued to the Phase II portion of the trial, and again the combination showed no 
unexpected toxicity.  Among the first 25 patients, the response rate was 57%, with 2 CR, and 
many patients were taken to metastatic resection, making interpretation of PFS very difficult.  
Based on the results, a randomized Phase II trial of 160 patients has been proposed for 
ECOG-ACRIN, and will be proposed to the GI Steering Committee in a few months.

HDAC inhibition, with CI values that demonstrate marked synergy.  This positive interaction 
is even more enhanced under hypoxic conditions.  The combination of hydroxychloroquine

2.6  Hydroxychloroquine Clinical Experience 
Ch
loroquine (CQ) is a synthetic 4-aminoquinoline that has been used for 60 years in 
humans for malaria prophylaxis and treatment,38 rheumatoid arthritis,39 and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)40. It is an inexpensive orally available drug that has CNS 
penetration. It has a large therapeutic index, and its most predictable cumulative toxicity 
is retinopathy, which can be prevented by [CONTACT_513712].41 It is this toxicity 
a
nd worldwide malarial resistance to CQ that lead to discontinuation of extensive 
research into CQ’s non-malarial applications. Chloroquine derivatives such as HCQ are 
still used extensively in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosis and have a larger 
therapeutic index. The chemical structure of CQ derivatives allows them to serve as a 
weak base which is trapped in acidic cellular compartments.[ADDRESS_665676] significant anti- tumor activity

y inhibiting autophagy induced by [CONTACT_513713].43 
 
Adding chloroquine to improve the efficacy of anticancer therapy has already been tested 
in a randomized clinical trial. A small single-institution placebo-controlled phase III trial 
testing the addition of CQ at an oral daily dose of 150 mg to RT and carmustine in 
patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) yielded surprising

sults.44  Median overall survival was significantly longer in the CQ-treated patients (24 
months) than in controls (11 months). At the end of the observation period, six patients 
(40%) treated with CQ were alive at 59, 45, 30, 20 (1 each) and 27 (2 patients) months 
after surgery. In contrast, patients in the control group survived 32, 25, and [ADDRESS_665677] 
half as large in the CQ group compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 
0.21 to 1.26]; p= 0.139). 
 
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is commonly prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus at 
doses of 400 mg po daily. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of escalating 
doses of HCQ at 400 mg/800 mg/1200 mg po daily in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
followed by [CONTACT_102052] 400 mg po daily found that doses of up to 1200 mg p o 
daily were well tolerated.45 Dose limiting toxicities of nausea, vomiting and abdominal 
pa
in were observed at 800 and 1200 mg po daily. This toxicity correlated with blood 
HCQ levels, but not to blood levels of the other active metabolites, 
desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), or 
bisdesethylchloroquine (BDCQ). Improvement of symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis 
correlated with blood DHCQ levels, suggesting a dose-response relationship. 
Chloroquine derivatives are metabolized through the p450 enzyme system and CQ may 
inhibit the metabolism of CYP2D6- metabolized drugs.45,[ADDRESS_665678] early changes and prevent overt visual loss. 
 
 UPCC [ZIP_CODE] (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/[ADDRESS_665679] previously conducted several trials of HCQ in combination with anticancer 
agents ranging from HCQ/alkylating therapy for glioblastoma, through 
HCQ/temsirolimus in Phase I, as well as FOLFOX/bevacizumab/HCQ in colorectal 
cancer. A CNS consortium trial (led from the University of Pennsylvania) to test the 
addition of HCQ at escalating doses to RT/temozolomide found excessive 
my
elosuppression compared to temozolomide alone and reached a daily dose of only 
[ADDRESS_665680] been higher, and a dose level 
of 1200 mg is currently being explored. Dermatologic effects and fatigue associated with 
mTOR inhibitors do not appear to be worsened by [CONTACT_513714] 1000 mg daily. In 
th
e frontline setting for metastatic colorectal cancer, 600mg twice daily dosing was used 
along with FOLFOX as the phase II dose without any additional toxicity. 
 
The pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) studied in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis, malaria, and healthy volunteers demonstrate marked intra- and interpatient 
variability, with a two-fold range in total clearance (4-10 L/h) (26-8). The variability in 
the rate of absorption from oral dosing has been reported to be as high as 87%, 
contributing to differences in peak blood concentrations (Cmax) and time to peak 
concentration (Tmax) among patients receiving identical doses (26-8). Due to its long 
terminal elimination half-life of approximately [ADDRESS_665681] 120 days of continuous 
dosing are required before blood HCQ levels reach 90% of steady- state concentrations. 
Predicted blood concentrations are 898 ng/mL and 1796 ng/mL for patients receiving 200 
mg and 400 mg daily of HCQ sulfate, respectively.49  A one- compartment population 
p
harmacokinetic model with a lag time was developed to estimate individual HCQ 
pharmacokinetic parameters in 36 patients who participated in a dose-escalation trial of 
HCQ in conjunction with radiation therapy and temozolomide for glioblastoma 
multiforme48. Population values for apparent volume of distribution (Vd) and total 
clearance were 604 L and 10.7 L/hr, with CV% of 23% and 5%, respectively. Mean 
individual estimated HCQ pharmacokinetic values for Vd were 573 L (range, 205-1291 
L) and clearance 10.5 L/hr (range, 6.8-13.7 L/hr). Mean estimated Cmax values were 
linear and proportional to total daily oral HCQ sulfate doses at 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg

2.7 E
ntinostat Clinical Experience 
Enti
nostat, also known as MS-275, is a synthetic benzamide derivative that has been 
demonstrated to preferentially inhibit class I HDACs, especially HDAC type 1.  
Preclinical animal models of entinostat demonstrated a T max of 30-40 minutes and T 1/2 of 
one hour.  Based on this data, the initial phase I trial of entinostat started dosage at 2 
mg/m2 daily for the first [ADDRESS_665683] cycle, and pharmacokinetic data 
suggested a half-life of 30-50 times longer than that observed in the animal models.   As a 
result, dosing was changed to biweekly, and all subsequent phase I trials used either 
weekly or biweekly dosing strategies.  Plasma clearance of entinostat in humans follows 
bi-exponential kinetics suggestive of enterohepatic circulation with a T 1/[ADDRESS_665684] used measurement of histone 
H3 acetylation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) as a surrogate for HDAC 
inhibition, although this does not nearly reflect the full spectrum of HDAC inhibitor

that HCQ is well-tolerated with multiple forms of chemotherapy, and specifically with 
the combination of FOLFOX/bevacizumab in colorectal cancer, as well as with sorafenib.  
Based on very striking (Table 1) preclinical data that support the further addition of 
HDA
C inhibition, this trial is proposed as a test of principle that augmented autophagy 
inhibition can render a purely  antiangiogenic therapy more effective.  Since regorafenib 
a
lone is associated with a 1% response rate, we would view a 15% response rate with the 
combination as promising and worth developi[INVESTIGATOR_513698].

scalation from dose level 3 is required.  Toxicity attributable to hydroxychloroquine is 
not expected given its excellent tolerability in multiple phase II studies with combination

hemotherapy using 1200 mg per day.  In the event that dose level 3 exceeds the MTD 
(
as described below), provision is made for stepwise dose de-escalation by 200 mg to

B
efore accrual to the next dose level may begin, all patients in the first cohort must 
c
omplete the first 4 weeks of treatment, permitting toxicities to be assessed. The target 
DLT rate is ≤ 33%. The MTD will be defined as a) the dose producing DLT in 1 out of 6 
patients, or b) the dose level below the dose which produced DLT in ≥ 2 out of 3 patients, 
or in ≥ 2 out of 6 patients. The rules for dose escalation and cohort size are outlined in 
T
able 3. No intra-patient dose escalation is planned.

Tablets of HCQ are available in 200 mg strengths. HCQ will be administered in two 
divided doses daily. When taking HCQ twice daily, the two daily doses should be taken 
as close as possible to 12 hours apart. Patients will be instructed to swallow the whole 
tablet in rapid succession without chewing.  Patients receiving antacids, sucralfate, 
c
holestyramine, and/or bicarbonate should have the HCQ and entinostat drug doses 
administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after these medications.

Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 20 4.3  Phase II Dose
 Expansion 
To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), at least [ADDRESS_665705] be treated 
at the MTD for 2 cycles.  In order to fulfill this criterion, patients who go off study before 
the completion of 2 cycles for reasons other than toxicity (e.g. disease progression) will 
be replaced in this cohort.  The RP2D will be defined as a dose in which fewer than 33% 
of patients have a DLT and at which chronic administration is tolerated.  To evaluate for 
chronic toxicity, tolerability is defined as 4 out of 6 patients treated for 2 cycles at the 
RP2D receiving during cycle 2: 
1) At least 80% (in total mg per cycle) of the regorafenib dose at which the patient 
begins cycle 2 
2) At least 75% of entinostat doses, with no more than one dose reduction 
3) At least 80% (in total mg per cycle) of the HCQ doses 
 
Should chronic tolerability fail to be demonstrated at the initial RP2D, the previous dose 
level (or a lower dose level at the discretion of the principal investigator) will be 
expanded until at least [ADDRESS_665706] been treated at this new RP2D for 2 cycles. 
Ev
aluation for chronic tolerability will be performed as above after 2 cycles until the 
RP2D is determined. 
 
After determination of the RP2D, an additional 20 patients will be enrolled at this dose 
le
vel in the Phase II portion. 
 
4.4  Experimental Drug Compliance  
Tre
atment compliance to entinostat and HCQ will be assessed at the end of each cycle. 
Patients will complete a diary to document their weekly intakes. They will be instructed 
to return all unused drugs (partially used and empty containers) and their diary at each 
visit. Site staff will perform accountability of the returned drug and will assess patient 
compliance. Site staff must ensure that the patient clearly understands the directions for 
self-medication and follows the schedule.

Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/[ADDRESS_665707] 4 weeks of 
this study. Any non-hematologic AE of Grade 3 or higher that is judged to be probably 
treatment-relate d will be considered a DLT with the exceptions of fatigue; rash 
a
ttributable to regorafenib; or nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that has improved to Grade < 
1 within 72 hours.  Any non-hematologic AE of Grade 4 or higher of any duration that is 
j
udged to be probably treatment-related will be considered a DLT except for elevations of 
lipase and/or amylase in the absence of clinical pancreatitis. 
 
The following hematologic DLT will be considered if any occurs in the first cycle: 
1) grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days 
2)  febrile neutropenia (T > 100.4 F in presence of ANC <500) 
3)
  platelet count less than 25,000/mm3 
4)
  platelet count less than 50,000/mm3 with clinically significant hemorrhage 
 
If a DLT is observed in exactly [ADDRESS_665708] having DLTs. The rules for dose escalation and 
cohort size are outlined in Table 3. No intra-patient dose escalation is planned. 
 
Evaluable Patients:  Patients will be evaluable for toxicity if they have taken one dose of 
HCQ and entinostat.  Patients who experience a dose-limiting toxicity will be evaluable 
fo
r the cohort after at least one dose of HCQ and one dose of entinostat.  To be 
considered for evaluability in a Phase I cohort in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity, 
patients should have completed > 85% of HCQ doses, and at least [ADDRESS_665709] completed 85% of their 
e
xpected dose of HCQ and at least 3 doses of entinostat in the initial 4 weeks, in the 
a
bsence of progression. Patients who do not meet these criteria will be replaced. In the 
unexpected event of excess toxicity at dose level 1, there is provision (Table 3) for a dose 
reduction of both HCQ and entinostat.

ETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS 
8.1 Definitions 
8.1.1  Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study. The CTC version 4.0 will be used to 
grade toxicity. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events. 
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the 
abnormality: 
 Results in study withdrawal 
 Is associated with a serious adverse event 
 Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 Is considered by [CONTACT_1372] 
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event is any 
AE that is: 
 Fatal 
 Life-threatening 
 Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 An important medical event 
 Pregnancy 
8.1.3  Important Medical Events 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the patient, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. All adverse events 
that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events.

otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented 
as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event. 
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported 
as an adverse event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68034] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful.

[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event module of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and 
abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though 
should be grouped under one diagnosis. All adverse events occurring during the study period 
must be recorded. The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the 
cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be 
followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation should be recorded and reported immediately.

Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of 
subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, 
a

All data requested on the CRF must be recorded. All missing data must be explained. 
Data will be collected using CRFs designed, stored and secured in Velos. 
 
9.4  Study Monitoring, Auditing and Inspecting 
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], 
the sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and the ACC CRU monitors of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection 
instruments, study data etc.). The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of 
applicable study-related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).   
P
articipation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_137713]. Vivek Narayan, MD will act as medical monitor for this study. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_665734] 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009]. Changes in the largest diameter 
(
unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case 
of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
10.1 Definitions 
Evaluable for toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment on study. 
 
Evaluable for objective response: Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
 UPCC [ZIP_CODE] (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 43 Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered 
e
valuable for non-target disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 
 
10.2 Disease Parameters 
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_665735] 
x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_665736] scan, or >[ADDRESS_665737] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_665738] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable. 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
 
 UPCC [ZIP_CODE] (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 44 Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It 
may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up. 
 
10.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment 
and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
e
ach identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 
10.3.1 Clinical lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and <10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., 
 UPCC [ZIP_CODE] (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 45 ski
n nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_665739] slice thickness greater than 5 
mm
, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI 
is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). 
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_665740] (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. 
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. 
 
 UPCC [ZIP_CODE] (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/[ADDRESS_665741] normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response. 
 
10.3.6 Cytology, Histology 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. 
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_665742] scanning in assessment 
of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
• Ne gative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
• No  FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this 
is PD. If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
 UPCC [ZIP_CODE] (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 47 init
ial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up 
corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
 
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
10.4 Response Criteria 
10.4.1.  Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum mus t 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study 
 
10.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis) 
 
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits 
 
 UPCC [ZIP_CODE] (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 48 Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase. 
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator). 
 
10.4.[ADDRESS_665743] response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be a ccepted as disease progression.  
Note: Patients wit h a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progres sion even after discontinuation of treatment.

10.4.3 Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. 
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

Examples of sensitive in vivo CYP substrates and CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic range 
are summarized below.  
 
Examples of substrates that may be affected by [CONTACT_513727]1 
CYP1A2  Theophylline, tizanidine  
CYP2C8   
 Paclitaxel  
CYP3A2  Alfentanil, astemizole 3, cisapride 3, cyclos porine, dihydroergotamine, 
ergotamine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, 
terfenadine 3  
 
1   CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic range refers to drugs whose exposure-response 
relationship indicates that small increases in their exposure levels by [CONTACT_513728] (e.g., Torsades de Pointes).  
2   Because a number of CYP3A substrates (e.g., darunavir, maraviroc) are also substrates of P-
gp, the observed increase in exposure could be due to inhibition of both CYP3A and P-gp.

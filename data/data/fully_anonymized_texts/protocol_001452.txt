Methodology:  This is a Phase 2,  double -blind,  placebo -controlled study  to determine  the dose regimen,  
safety,  tolerability, and efficacy  of VP-102 in subjects  with EGW.  
This study is divided into two parts (Part A and Part B). The Schedule of Assessments and Procedures  
is presented in  Table 1 . 
Part  A (dose  regimen  finding)  study  design:  The aim of Part  A is to determine  the two best  treatment  
regimens  for evaluation of safety  and efficacy  in Part  B. 
Treatment regimens will be evaluated based on the requirement to form blisters in most patients, while  
maintaining a favorable safety and tolerability profile (e.g., majority of LSR AEs are mild or moderate  
in severity). Accordingly, increasing durations of skin exposure to study drug (VP -102 or placebo) will  
be evaluated  in three  treatment groups  (n=6/group) that  will enroll  progressively.  
Subjects  will have a Screening  Period  of up to [ADDRESS_677159] treatment,  followed  by a Treatment  
Period  starting  at Treatment  Visit  1 and lasting  through  Treatment  Visit  4. 
Eighteen (18) subjects at up to six sites (additional sites may be added if required to ensure successful  
recruitment  of the study population)  will be enrolled,  into either  the 2-hour (Group  1), 6-hour (Group 2), 
or 24- hour (Group 3) treatment duration of skin exposure groups (n=6 subjects/group). Each group will  
include a minimum of two subjects from each sex and will be randomized 5:1 (VP -102:placebo) within  
each group. All subjects will receive either  VP-102 (containing 0.7%  cantharidin  [w/v]  topi[INVESTIGATOR_521950]-
forming solution) or placebo. Warts are to be treated and then covered (unless prohibited by [CONTACT_521996])  with transparent  surgical  tape (e.g., 3M™  Blenderm™  brand)  that will remain  on the skin until 
the designated time for removal. Subjects  will be asked  to remove  the surgical  tape and study drug with 
soap and water  after the pre-determined duration of  skin exposure  for their group.  
Study drug (VP-102 or  placebo)  will be administered  once  every  21 ±[ADDRESS_677160] etion of a blinded review of the safety  
and tolerability data by a Safety Review Panel. The Safety Review Panel will be responsible for  
reviewing blinded safety and tolerability data and will provide determinations on trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_521951].  A blinded review  of treatment -emergent  adverse events (TEAEs),  focusing on those  
of moderate  or severe  intensity,  will be performed  by [CONTACT_521997]: E77726CD -B745 -46DC -88B9 -FB9157EEB965

for each subsequent cohort. This review will be conducted after the six subjects in a designated Group  
have  completed the 48-hour (±8 hours)  Visit.  The Safety  Review  Panel  will determine  whether  
enrollment can be initiated into the next Group, OR if more data (e.g., waiting for additional treatments  
for enrolled  subjects or the addition of more  subjects to a group)  are needed  before  making  a 
determination to open enrollment into the next Group (i.e., the review conducted after six subjects have  
completed Group 1 could open enrollment into Group 2 and the review after Group 2 could open  
enrollment  into Group  3). An additional  blinded safety  review of TEAEs,  focusing  on those  of moderate 
or severe  intensity,  will be performed after all six subjects  in Group [ADDRESS_677161]  completed  the 48-hour 
(±8 hours)  Visit,  in order  to support  dose selection  for Part B (Safety  and Efficacy).  Safety  Review  Panel  
members  are blinded  to the treatment  assignment.  
Part B (safety and efficacy) study design: Part B of the study will begin enrollment only  after the 
Sponsor has selected the two dose regimens in Part A, which will be called VP -[ADDRESS_677162]  be provided to the sites prior  to Part B  
enrollment is  to begin. The study will remain  blinded until completion  of both  parts of  the study.  
Approximately 90 subjects  at up to 9 sites (additional  sites may be added  if required  to ensure  successful  
recruitment of the study population) will be enrolled and randomized to one of four treatment arms.  
Randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_521998] ~60%  of any treatment  arm (e.g.,  
placebo group for the 6- hour and 24- hour wash- off cannot have any one gender ≥ 60%). Two of the  
treatment arms will be VP -102 Regimen 1 and VP -102 Regimen 2. The other two treatment arms will  
be placebo  (Placebo  Regimen  1 and Placebo  Regimen  2), with corresponding  durations  of skin exposure  
matching  those  selected  for VP-102 Regimen  1 and Regimen  2. As an example, if the regimens selected  
from  Part A are the 2-hour and 6-hour applications  of VP-102, then VP-102 Regimen  1 would be VP-102 
treatment  for 2-hours  and VP-102 Regimen  2 would be VP-102 treatment  for 6-hours.  Likewise,  Placebo  
Regimen 1 would be placebo treatment for 2 hours and Placebo Regimen 2 would be placebo treatment  
for 6-hours.  Randomization  of the four treatment arms  (VP-102 Regimen  1:VP -102 Regimen  2:Placebo  
Regimen  1:Placebo Regimen 2)  will be 3:3:2:2.  
In both Regimen 1 and Regimen 2, study drug will be administered to EGW once every 21 ±[ADDRESS_677163] participation: Pre -study screening for eligibility (informed consent, 
demographics, physical exam, vital signs, prior and concomitant medications, and medical history) can  
occur  up to 14 days before,  or on the same  day as Treatment  Visit 1. The dermatologic  exam,  wart count,  
wart measurement (diameter), location of all warts, and photographs (if applicable) must be repeated at

interval  will be  determined by [CONTACT_521999].  
Subjects  who achieve complete  clearance of all treatable warts  before  Treatment  Visit  [ADDRESS_677168]  
cleared.  The 24-hour,  7-day, and 14-day evaluation  of response  to treatment  (ERT)  telephone  follow -ups 
will be conducted per protocol  for those instances in  which  the subject  was treated.  
Part  A and Part B efficacy  procedures  
All required study activities, including an ERT (i.e., assessment of wart activity [count, location,  
diameter] and related LSRs), will be conducted per protocol. A Blinded Assessor will perform wart  
counts before the ERT assessment at Treatment Visit 2, Treatment Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, End of  
Treatment Visit,  and Follow -up Visit.  
Treatment visits are to take place in order (i.e., Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, and Treatment  
4). All subjects will receive application of study drug to EGW, including an approximate margin of  
healthy surrounding skin, at an interval of every 21 ±4 days until complete clearance of all treatable  
warts,  or a maximum  of four applications.  
No partial  treatment  of warts  (e.g.,  treating  one wart and not another)  is permitted.  In any instance where  
the clinician is uncertain if a residual wart is remaining, treatment should be applied. Instructions for  
application of the study drug are outlined in the Instructions for Use included in the drug shipment, as  
well as included  in the Site  Regulatory Packet.  
Subjects should be re -treated only after 17 to 25 days (i.e., 21 ±4 days) have elapsed since the previous  
treatment and only after any LSRs have resolved sufficiently to allow evaluation of the treatment site.  
Treatment  should only take place  at a visit when  all warts  are evaluable (i.e., not obscured  by [CONTACT_522000]). All warts that are not completely clear should undergo treatment with study drug. Subjects  
exhibiting skin reactions that need additional time, at the Investigator’s discretion, before they can be  
treated again will be evaluated and asked to return for their next treatment visit after the area is  
considered sufficiently resolved to allow for the next treatment (e.g., ongoing dryness or erythema is  
appropriate  to treat).  See instructions below  regarding unscheduled visits.  
Subjects who receive <[ADDRESS_677169]  misses a  treatment  visit,  and is outside  the 4-day study  window,  they may return 
and be  treated  at the next  available opportunity with the subsequent  visit scheduled  21 ±4 days  after  the 
actual treatment visit. No treatment should be administered after the treatment period without the  
Sponsor’s  approval.  
An ERT assessment will be conducted at  each treatment visit (1 -4; in -person before treatment or via  
follow -up telephone  calls)  at 24 hours  (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), and 14 days (±24  hours)  after each 
treatment  visit (but  not after “unscheduled” visits). Note that  the ERT telephone  calls at 24 hours  
(±6 hours), 7 days (±24  hours)  and 14 days (±24  hours)  are not required  if there  was no treatment  during  
that period. In Part A Treatment Period 1 only, subjects will return to the clinic for an in- person ERT  
assessment  at 48 hours  (±8 hours)  after Treatment  Visit 1. The ERT  includes  questions  related  to removal  
of surgical  tape and study  drug (if applicable)  and collects  any new AEs,  LSRs,  or changes  in

concomitant  medications  since  the last contact.  The subject  will be given  an opportunity  to ask questions  
and review any concerns. In the event that any post -treatment LSR presents a safety concern (including  
but not limited to severe blistering, ulceration, edema, or pain), an “Unscheduled” clinic visit must be  
scheduled and the subject assessed accordingly. In addition, if any post -treatment AEs present a safety  
concern, t he subject may be brought in for an unscheduled visit. The ERT assessments will be recorded  
by a research team member on the ERT form. The ERT visits may not be conducted by a person  
designated  as a Blinded  Assessor.  Phone  calls conducted outside  of the required  study  visits  or required  
ERT assessments should be documented in the subject’s source note but are not required to be entered  
in the electronic data capture system.  
ERT assessments, wart count, and wart location will be conducted before treatment application at all  
Treatment Visits  1 to 4, as well as at the EOT  Visit on Study Day  84 (–0/+8 days)  and at the Follow -up 
Visits on Study Day 112 (±7 days) and Study Day 147 (±7 days). Wart measurement will be conducted  
before  treatment  applicati on at Treatment  Visit 1, as  well as at the  EOT  Visit  on Study Day 84 (-
0/+8 days) and at the Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 (±7 days) and Study Day 147 (±7 days).  
Subjects  who clear  all warts  before  the Study Day 84 (EOT)  Visit  will still be required  to return  for each 
of the scheduled  in-person treatment  visits,  as well  as the Study  Day 84 (EOT)  Visit,  the Study  Day 112 
follow -up visit, and the Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit. A Provider Treatment Questionnaire will be  
completed at the Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit by a clinician who applied treatment to the subject during  
the course of the study. All subjects will continue in the study for two additional Follow -up Visits on  
Study Day 112 and Study  Day 147 (EOS).  
All treatmen t visits  will include  a wart count, performed  before  treatment (if  applicable)  and before  ERT  
assessment. No treatment will be required if the wart is considered clear. Genital warts that develop in  
areas that are unable to be treated, (e.g., close to a mucous membrane) and other wart types (e.g.,  
common  warts)  will not be  evaluated, documented,  or considered  in the analysis.  
Wart counts will be conducted at Screening, Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, Treatment 4, End  
of Treatment  and Follow -up Visits by a trained  member  of the study  team.  Other  than the screening  visit 
and Day 1, wart counts  will also be conducted by a member  of the research  team  that has been  identified  
and trained  as a Blinded Assessor.  The Blinded  Assessor  may be utilized  for a subject’s initial screening,  
enrollment and treatment Visit 1 activities, however, may not perform any other study related activities  
other than wart counts at subsequent visits (e.g., follow -up phone calls or unscheduled visits) for the  
same subject.  The Blinded Assessor  is not  required to be the same person  for each assessment.  
It can sometimes  be challenging to determine  if a wart is completely  clear  after treatment  due to ongoing 
LSRs. At any visit in which the Investigator is unable to eva luate or treat some warts due to ongoing  
LSRs,  an “Unscheduled” visit should be documented.  The timing  of the next visit  will be determined  by 
[CONTACT_522001].  The research  team  should be in contact  [CONTACT_522002] a treatment visit can be scheduled  within  21 ±[ADDRESS_677170]  the initial  wart count  and measure wart diameter  will be provided during Investigator

Name(s)  of active  ingredient(s):  Cantharidin  
Test Product,  Dose,  and Mode  of Administration:  Study drug (VP-102 or placebo)  is contained  within  
a single -use applicator. Study drug will be applied in sufficient quantity to cover the entirety of each  
wart including approximately a 1 mm margin of surrounding, healthy skin. The  VP-102 single -use 
applicator  contains 0.45 mL of 0.7% w/v  cantharidin,  (Lot # 108107172).  
The placebo single -use applicator contains the same formulation as the VP -102 applicator but does not  
contain the active  pharmaceutical  ingredient  cantharidin  (Lot # 108207171.)  
Duration of Treatment: Study duration from Treatment Visit 1 through the final follow -up visit is  
approximately  147 days  (21 weeks).  The length  of study  participation  is approximately 84 (–0/+8)  days 
for the EOT assessment ( primary endpoint) and Study Day 147 (±7 days) to complete the study, in  
addition to the screening visit of up to [ADDRESS_677181]  
of up to four applications of study drug at intervals of 21 ±[ADDRESS_677182] within  
a 75- day period. No treatment should be administered after Day 75 without the Sponsor’s approval.  
Post-treatment Follow -up Visits on Study Day 84 ( –0/+8 days) (EOT), Study Day 112 (±7 days),), and  
Study Day 147 (±7 days) are included for subjects to evaluate the durability of treatment response over  
time.  
Criteria for Evaluation  
Primary  efficacy  endpoint:  
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting complete clearance of all treatable warts at the Study Day 84  
(EOT)  Visit 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints:  
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting complete clearance of all treatable warts (baseline and new) at  
Treatment Visit 2, Treatment Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, and Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 
and Study Day 147 (EOS)  
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting 90% and 75% clearance of all treatable warts (baseline and new)

Exploratory  efficacy  endpoints:  
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting reduction of  ≥ 1 treatable wart  from  baseline  at Treatment  Visit  2, 
Treatment  Visit  3, Treatment  Visit 4, Study Day 84 (EOT),  and Follow -up Visits  on Study Day 112 
and Study Day 147 (EOS)  
• Proportion  of subjects who are clear  at the Study  Day 84 (EOT)  Visit  and remain  clear  at the Follow - 
up Visits  on Study Day 112 and Study Day 147 (EOS)  
• Change  from  baseline in total wart area (sum  of individual  warts)  at Study  Day 84 (EOT),  and 
Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 and Study Day 147 (EOS)

Safety  endpoints:  
Safety analyses will include AEs, LSRs, medical history (including previous HPV immunization),  
physical  examinations, vital  signs,  and concomitant  medication use  
• The incidence of  AEs  will be assessed  throughout  the study;  AEs  will include  all LSRs,  whether  or 
not they  are expected or  related  to study  drug mechanism  of action.  
• LSRs of all previously treated areas will be assessed at each treatment visit using the protocol  
specific ERT  form  
• Limited physical examinations will be completed before the first treatment and at the Study Day  
147 (EOS) Visit; additional physical examinations will be performed when clinically warranted  
(e.g.,  subject  reports  symptoms classified  as an  AE requiring further  evaluation)  
• Vital signs (temperature and heart rate) will be obtained before the treatment is applied at each  
treatment  visit  and at  the start  of the Study  Day 84 (EOT)  Visit  
• Concomitant medication  use will be  collected  at each  study visit and ERT telephone contact  
[CONTACT_522008]:  
Although no formal  power  calculations  have  been  performed, it is expected  that a sample  size of 
18 subjects in Part A and 90 subjects in Part B, evaluable at the Study Day 84 ( –0/+8 days) EOT Visit,  
will be informative regarding wart clearance rates that can support assumptions in subsequent placebo - 
controlled  trials.  
Analysis  populations:  
• The Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Population will  include  all randomized subjects  
• The Safety Population will include all randomized subjects who receive ≥ 1 application of study  
drug (VP-102 or placebo)

• The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all subjects who receive all planned treatments of  
study drug (e.g., complete  up to four treatments  within  the Day 75 treatment  window  or clear  before  
Day 75), had no major protocol violations, and were assessed for clearance at the Study Day 84  (-
0/+8 days)  EOT Visit  
Summaries  of data from  subjects enrolled  in Part A will be pooled with corresponding subjects  in Part B. 
For instance, if one of the two regimens selected for Part B is the 6 -hour application of VP -102, then  
results from subjects who received the 6 -hour application of VP -102 from Part A will be pooled with  
results from  subjects who  received  the 6- hour application of  VP-102 from  Part B. 
An additional set of tables will be generated t hat summarize subjects from Part A of the study who are 
not used in Part B of the study. Summary statistics for continuous variables and counts and percentages  
for categorial variables will be shown by [CONTACT_3148]. However, due to the limited number of subje cts for  
this set of tables  (expected  n=6), analyses  to be carried  out will  only be descriptive in  nature. 
Subject demographics, efficacy tables, and subject dropout rates will be tabulated at the Study Day 84  
(EOT) Visit and Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit. Data  will be summarized using descriptive statistics  
(sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and  
frequencies, and percentages for discrete variables. Corresponding by- subject data listings will be  
tabulated.  
Efficacy will be evaluated in the ITT and PP Population by [CONTACT_1570]. At the end of the study,  
tables will be generated that pool subjects from Part A and Part B for VP -102 Regimen 1, VP -102 
Regimen  2, Placebo  Regimen  1, and Placebo  Regimen  2. For  the efficacy  endpoints,  summary  statistics  
for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables will be presented. In  
addition, statistical  comparisons will be carried  out to compare  VP-102 Regimen  1 to Placebo  Regimen  
1 and VP -102 Regimen 2 to Placebo Regimen 2. Comparisons made within Regimen 1 (VP -102 vs  
Placebo) will be independent of comparisons made within Regimen 2. Comparisons may be carried  
across Regimens; however, no formal statistical testing will be carried out with com parisons being  
considered  only observational.  
An additional set of tables will be generated that summarize subjects from Part A of the study who do  
not participate in Part B of the study. Summary statistics for continuous variables and counts and  
percentag es for categorial  variables will be  shown by  [CONTACT_3148].  However,  due to the limited  number  of 
subjects  for this set of tables  (expected  n=6),  analyses  to be carried  out will only be descriptive  in nature. 
Safety analyses will be conducted in the Safety Population by [CONTACT_147246]. AEs, including 
LSRs, will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Version 20.0. 
The number and percentage of subjects having TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_522009] a breakdown by [CONTACT_1570]. A subject -by-subject AEs data listing,  
including  verbatim  term,  preferred  term,  treatment,  severity,  location, and causal  relationship  to the study  
drug will be provided. The number of subjects experiencing TEAEs and number of TEAEs will be  
summarized  by [CONTACT_522010].

Footnotes  to Table 1  
a. Screening can occur up to 14 days before study drug application on Treatment Visit 1 (Day 1) or on the same day as Treatment Visit 1. If treatment is not applied on the same  
day as screening,  repeat  the assessments and procedures  of subject  eligibility,  medical  history,  genital wart history,  vital signs,  wart assessments  (wart  count,  wart measurement  
[diameter and area], location of all warts), dermatologic exam, photography (if applicable), and prior medication use at Treatment Visit [ADDRESS_677185]  be signed before any  study  specific  procedures  are performed.  
b. The ERT telephone calls should be conducted based on the time of study drug application. The ERT telephone calls at 24 hours (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), and 14 days  
(±24  hours)  after each treatment visit are not required  if there  was no treatment  during that treatment  period.  The ERT  telephone  call at 24  hours  (±6 hours),  7 days (±24  hours),  
and 14 days (±24 hours) after  each treatment  will only collect information since the last contact.  
c. All treatments may be administered over the course of up to 75 days. Provider questionnaire to be completed at the Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit by a clinician who applied  
treatment  to the subject  during the course of  the study.  
d. In the event that any post -treatment LSR AE presents a safety concern (including but not limited to severe blistering, ulceration, edema, or pain), an “Unscheduled” clinic visit  
must  be scheduled  and the subject  assessed  accordingly.  In addition,  if any post-treatment AEs  present  a safety  concern,  the subject  may be brought  in for an unscheduled  visit.  
“Unscheduled”  visits  should also be used for visits  in which treatment  is unable to be applied to all warts  due to ongoing LSRs.  
e. Subjects  are to be scheduled  in 21 (±4)-day intervals  after each treatment.  The next treatment  visit is to be scheduled  21 (±4) days after the last treatment,  but only after any LSR 
has resolved sufficiently to allow evaluation of the treatment site. The research team should be in contact [CONTACT_522011] a treatment visit can be 
scheduled  within  21 days (±4) when  possible.  
f. Subjects will return for additional Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 (±7 days) and Study Day 147 (±7 days) (EOS) for an assessment of warts to determine the durability of 
previous responses and/or LSRs. Subjects are to attend all planned in- person visits,  whether they have achieved complete clearance before or at the Study Day 84 ( –0/+8 days)  
EOT  assessment.  
g. Demographics:  date of birth,  sex, race,  and ethnicity  will be collected.  
h. Vital signs  (e.g., temperature,  heart  rate) will be obtained at  each treatment visit before  application  of study  drug.  
i. Additional  limited  physical  examination,  symptom,  or AE-directed  physical  examination may  be performed  if warranted  (see Source/eCRF  for a more  detailed  description)  
j. Dermatologic exam (including Fitzpatrick Skin Type at Screening only) and location of each wart is specified by [CONTACT_483736]. Wart count, location,  and measurements  
(diameter) should be recorded at Treatment Visit 1, before treatment, to confirm that the subject meets inclusion  criteria of ≥ 2 to ≤ 30 warts and that the warts are ≤ 8 mm in  
diameter  each with a total wart area (i.e., all warts  combined)  ≥ 10 mm2. Wart  area should  be calculated  at Screening/Treatment  1, End of Treatment,  and Follow -up Visits  using  
the formula  “area= πr2”, where r= radius  of wart.  Warts that develop  in areas  that are unable  to be treated,  (e.g.,  close  to a mucous  membrane)  will not be evaluated,  documented,  
or considered in the analysis. Wart counts will be conducted at Screening, Treatm ent 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, Treatment 4, End of Treatment, and Follow -up Visits by a  
trained member of the study team. Other than the screening visit and Day 1, wart counts will also be conducted by a designate d Blinded Assessor. Wart counts completed at  
Treatment  Visit 2, Treatment  Visit 3, and Treatment  Visit 4; and Follow -up Visits  on Study  Day 84 (–0/+8 days)  (EOT);  Study Day 112 (±7 days),  and Study  Day 147 (±7 days)  
(EOS) should be performed  before  the dermatologic  exam  and ERT  assessments  and will be obtained  by a Blinded  Assessor.  The Blinded  Assessor  does not have  to be the same  
person at each visit.  Blinded  assessors must  be trained  to the study,  complete  Good  Clinical Practices,  and be listed  on the FDA  FORM  [ADDRESS_677186]’s  participation

remaining, the same areas will be photographed and repeated at the Follow -up Visits on Study Day 84 ( –0/+8 days) (EOT) and Study Day 147 (±7 days) (EOS) regardless of  
whether  warts  are present.  These  images  may be used on handouts  in future  trials,  for training  purposes,  or future  marketing  materials.  Photographs  will be de-identified  to those  
outside  the research  team  and stored in  a HIPAA compliant  manner. Efforts will  be made to ensure  that no photographs  with identifiable  features  are obtained.  
m. Application of study  drug and surgical  tape must  be conducted by a study  team  member  who is not considered,  or has not acted  as, the Blinded  Assessor  for the subject  throughout  
the subject’s participation. Surgical tape should only be removed at the designated removal time, when the treatment site is washed and study drug removed. Surgical tape and  
study drug may be gently removed from individual warts before the designated removal time in the event of significant blistering, significant pain, or treatment -emergent AEs.  
The surgical tape and study drug should not be removed from the remaining unproblematic warts until  the designated removal time is reached. Removal of the surgical tape  
should be aided by [CONTACT_522012], which will also help to prevent unroofing the blisters. Subjects who remove study drug bef ore the assigned time frame will be considered a  
protocol  deviation  unless  early  removal  is due to protocol  defined  criteria.  Early  removal  is defined  as removal  of study  drug outside  of the following  windows:  ±1-hour window  
for the 2-hour duration  of skin exposure  group;  ±2-hour window  for the 6-hour duration  of skin exposure  group,  and ±6-hour window  for the 24-hour duration  of skin exposure  
group.  
n. In both Part A and Part B, an in-person  follow -up ERT  assessment  will be conducted  at each treatment  visit (1-4) before  study drug application  and at Follow -up Visits  on Study 
Day 84 ( –0/+8 days) (EOT), Study Day 112 (±7 days), and Study Day 147 (±7 days) (EOS). In addition, for Part A Treatment Period 1 only, an in -person follow -up ERT  
assessment will be conducted  at 48  hours (±8 hours). Follow -up tele phone assessments for ERT will be conducted at 24 hours  (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), and 14 days  
(±24 hours) after each treatment visit (1 -4) in which study drug is applied. Assessments will be recorded by [CONTACT_522013]. All E RT safety  
assessments must be conducted by a qualified member of the research team. ERT assessments and telephone calls must be conduct ed by a study team member who is not  
considered,  or has  not acted  as, the Blinded  Assessor  for the  subject  throughout  the subject’s  participation.  
o. Subjects will be provided with take -home instructions describing how to remove the surgical tape, the possible LSR’s, and what to expect over the next 24 hours t o several  
months.  A 24-hour emergency  number  will also be provided.  The next visit date/calls  and time will be indicated  on the form.  An LSR Guide  for subjects  will be reviewed  at the 
clinic with the subject by [CONTACT_5051], with copi[INVESTIGATOR_521952] -treatment ERT follow -up telephone calls. Both take home instructions and  
LSR Guide  will be provided and reviewed after  each treatment  to ensure  understanding and confirm  the education materials  are available.

 4.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
4.1 Introduction  
 
4.1.1 Genital Warts  
 
Genital  warts  (also  known as anogenital  warts  or condyloma  acuminatum)  is a sexually  
transmitted viral disease caused by [CONTACT_522014][INVESTIGATOR_521954] (HPV).[1] Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_521955]- to-skin contact,  
usually during oral, genital, or anal sex with an infected partner.[2] Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_521956], vulva, vagina, cervix, and rectum. Diagnosis of genital  
warts  is usual ly made by [CONTACT_522015].[3] The four 
morphologic types of genital warts are cauliflower -shaped, smooth papular, keratotic,  
and flat. Genital  warts  cause  few symptoms  but can occasionally  be painful. Conditions  
known to predispose  women  to infection  with HPV  include  local  trauma,  diabetes,  and 
immuno -suppression.[1] 
 
Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in  
the [LOCATION_002].[4] Approximately 1% of people in the [LOCATION_002] have ge nital 
warts.[5] Risk factors for genital warts include multiple sex partners, early onset of  
sexual activity, long- term oral contraceptive use in women and previous history of  
other sexually transmitted diseases  (e.g., chlamydia,  gonorrhea,  genital  herpes or 
trichomoniasis, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes).[6] 
 
Safe and effective  HPV vaccines  are available for adolescents  and young adults,  but do 
not protect against all HPV types that can cause genital warts[5] Abstinence is the only  
completely  effective way  of avoiding genital warts.  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_677197] treatments for warts focus on  
destruction of the lesion through electrocautery, chem ical burning, cryotherapy, or  
immune  mediators.[1] Currently  available  treatments  for genital  warts  include  
podophyllin, imiquimod, sinecatechins, and procedural therapi[INVESTIGATOR_521957], 
trichloroacetic acid (TCA), laser, surgical, and electrocautery). A recently published 
clinical study explored the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_521958]  (Section  4.4.3).
[1] No single  treatment  is ideal  for all patients  and all warts.

VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  26  
 Treatment of anogenital warts is guided by [CONTACT_522016], number, anatomic site, patient  
preference;  convenience;  and provider  experience.  In addition, each of these treatments  
have shortcomings related to multiple applications, erosions and erythema, adverse  
effects,  long times  for resolution, and expense.[1] Because  of these shortcomings, some  
clinicians  have  employed combination therapy  (e.g., provider -administered  
cryotherapy with patient -applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_521959]).[3] 
However, limited data has been published on the safety and efficacy of combination  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].[3] 
 
4.1.3 Cantharidin  
 
For many dermatologists, 0.7% w/v cantharidin has been the treatment of choice for  
common warts  and molluscum  contagiosum  (MC) for decades.[7]. However,  
cantharidin remains an unapproved drug and there is no reliable or controlled source  
on the market.  
 
Cantharidin (1,2- dimethyl- 3,6-epoxyperhydrophthalic  anhydride)  is a lipophilic  
natural compound that can be isolated from the body fluids of the blister beetle, 
primar ily of the family Meloidae. The Mylabris species of beetle contains a much  
greater  concentration of cantharidin  than other  species  and is the primary  type of beetle 
used in modern cantharidin preparations. 
 
In contrast  to currently  available  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  cantharidin functions  as a vesicant,  
weakening desmosomes in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_521960] a liquid film - 
forming formulation. Application to the skin causes the activation of neutral serine  
proteases  resulting in the destruction of int ercellular desmosomes responsible for  
holding the layers  of the skin together.[8] Intracellular  tonofilaments  are also weakened,  
the result being a fluid -filled, thin -walled, epi[INVESTIGATOR_61355]. The superficial nature of  
the blisters is attributed to cantha ridin’s lesser effect on hemidesmosomes in the basal  
layer  compared  to the more  superficial  desmosomes. This process  is not associated  with 
scarring, as the underlying dermal layer of skin is undamaged. Cantharidin has no 
known direct antiviral effects. Cantharidin application also can stimulate an immune  
response in the skin that can cause local inflammation, which may be a contributing  
factor  in treating  viral skin disease.[9]

VP-102, a 0.7% w/v topi[INVESTIGATOR_521961] -forming cantharidin formulation has been developed  
to be consistent  with  the predominant  concentration  of cantharidin  used  by [CONTACT_13922]. 
VP-[ADDRESS_677198]

denatonium  benzoate has  been included.  
 
4.2 Nonclinical Studies  
 
Cantharidin is a potent  inhibitor  of protein phosphatases  that are found in all tissues.[10] 
The inhibition  of these  phosphatases  may be involved in cantharidin’s  systemic  
manifestations  when  delivered  orally  or via injection  (Section  6.1.1 of the 
Investigator’s Brochure [IB]). The available nonclinical studies to assess the potential  
for untoward pharmacodynamic effects of cantharidin with systemic exposure have  
largely focused on the cardiovascular system. With acute systemic exposure of rats to 
oral dosing with 6.9 mg/kg  (41.4 mg/m2) of cantharidin, cardiac waveform  and function 
were adversely  affected,  likely  related  to its inhibitory effect  on protein  
phosphatases.[11]. Cantharidin is a vasoconstrictor and may also be responsible for  
decreases in urine volume with single oral dose administration.[11, 12] However, it is  
possible that cantharidin may have a direct effect on the renal vascular and tubular  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_521962]. Cantharidin may also have  
an effect on central nervous system function,[11] although it is unclear whether noted 
decreases  in locomotion  and reduced  body  temperature  were  secondary  to the 
cardiovascular  manifestations noted with the  high doses. 
 
Information available on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of cantharidin showed 
that oral absorption of cantharidin in rats and dogs is rapid but incomplete, with peak 
systemic  exposures  occurring by 2 hours  in rats (Section  6.2 of the IB).[13] The apparent  
plasma elimination half -life of cantharidin was about 20 minutes in dogs.[14] Tissue  
distribution of cantharidin was ubiquitous, consistent with the widespread distribution  
of protein phosphatases.

Page  28  
 Nonclinical  toxicity  information  available on cantharidin  is predominantly from  single  
dose (acute)  studies  by [CONTACT_61429],  oral,  intraperitoneal,  and intravenous  (IV) routes  of 
administration  (Section  6.3 of the IB). The only adverse findings  associated  with acute 
dermal exposure to cantharidin in animals were local irritation and skin blistering. No  
systemic toxicity  was noted  by [CONTACT_522017].  
 
With an extensi ve history of use of cantharidin in humans, a limited nonclinical  
program  has been  developed to support  the use of  topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  (dermal)  VP-102. No 
nonclinical primary pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic studies were conducted by  
[CONTACT_522018]-102 or cantharidin. A single  Good Laboratory Practices  (GLP) - 
compliant  study evaluating  inhibition  of the human  ether -à-go-go-related  gene  (hERG) 
channel  as an in vitro cardiovascular  safety  pharmacology endpoint was conducted.  
 
The safety profile of topi[INVESTIGATOR_521963], as well as studies conducted in animals. With negligible systemic  
exposure after topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407], the strategy for the nonclinical toxicology program

genetic toxicity  testing  battery  with cantharidin, including a  bacterial reverse mutation  
assay,  a mammalian  cell chromosomal  aberration  assay,  and a mammalian  cell 
micronucleus  assay.  
 
An overview of the Verrica -sponsored toxicology studies conducted with cantharidin 
is provided in Table 2.

VP-102-[ADDRESS_677200]  of cantharidin  on the hERG  potassium  
channel current in stably transfected mammalian cells that express the hERG gene 
(Study 170922.WFU).  Specifically,  the study examined  the inhibitory effects  of 
cantharidin on the hERG  channel current at near -physiologic temperature. The study  
reported  no change in hERG  current  across  the cantharidin  concentration  range  (30 and 
300 µM). The IC [ADDRESS_677201] of cantharidin on hERG potassium current  
was estimated to be > 300 μM (> 60,000 ng/mL). At 300 μM, the concentration of  
cantharidin is > 17,000- fold higher than the highest level of cantharidin detected  
systemically  (3.4 ng/mL)  in a clinical  exposure  study conducted with topi[INVESTIGATOR_521964]-102 in molluscum patients (Study VP-102-103). 
 
Verrica  completed  a GLP -compliant  in vitro  genetic toxicity  test battery  with 
cantharidin. Three in vitro genotoxicity studies were conducted: a bacterial reverse  
mutation assay (Ames test), a mammalian ce ll micronucleus assay in TK6 human 
lymphoblastoid cells, and a mammalian cell chromosomal aberration assay in human  
peripheral  blood lymphocytes (HPBL).  
 
For the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Study AE58BG.502ICH.BTL), cantharidin 
was evaluated for its mutagenic potential by [CONTACT_522020]98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537, and at the tryptophan locus  of Escherichia  coliWP2  uvrA in the presence and 
absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. Based on the results of the  
preliminary toxicity assay, the maximum dose to be tested in the mutagenicity assay  
was 5000 µg/plate. At all concentrations tested, cantharidin was negative at select loci  
of several  S. typhimurum  and E. coli tester  strains,  suggesting that cantharidin  does not 
possess mutagenic  properties. 
 
In the mammalian  cell chromosomal  aberration  assay,  cantharidin  was evaluated  for its 
potential  to induce structural  chromosomal  aberrations  using HPBL in  either the  
presence or the absence of an exogenous  metabolic  activation  system  (Study  
AE58BG.341ICH.BTL). Overly condensed and distorted metaphase chromosomes  
were noted during the assay at several concentrations with < 50% cytotoxicity, which  
did not allow  for an adequate evaluation  of the test samples  that would  meet  the criteria  
for a valid assay in accordance with ICH S2(R1) guidance, and thus the study was  
terminated  before  completion.

 The mammalian  cell genotoxicity study assessed  the clastogenic  potential of 
cantharidin  (Study AE58BG.361CRESTICH.BTL). Specifically,  cantharidin was 
evaluated  for its potential  to induce  micronuclei  in TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells in 
either the presence or absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. A dose - 
dependent increase in micronuclei formation was observed in the non- activated 27-  
hour treatment  group with cantharidin  doses  of 1 µg/mL  (1.25%)  to 1.6 µg/mL  (2.25%)  
compared  with vehicle  (0.65%).  An increase  in micronuclei  formation  was not 
observed at similar concentrations with a 4- hour exposure. Compared with the vehicle  
group, an increase in micronucleus induction in either the absence or presence of an 
exogenous  metabolic  activation  system  was observed  at higher  cantharidin  
concentrations  of 3.5 µg/mL  (1.40%  vs 0.55%, respectively)  and 5.5 µg/mL  (1.20%  vs 
0.60%, respectively)  in the 4-hour treatment groups. Subsequent  analysis  with 
calcinosis,  Raynaud's  phenomenon, esophageal  dysmotility,  sclerodactyly,  and 
telangiectasia (CREST) staining revealed that a high frequency of micronuclei in the 
presence of kinetochore  staining  was observed in the cantharidin -treated  cells,  
suggesting that cantharidin induces micronuclei formation through an aneugenic, and 
not a clastogenic, mechanism of action.

 4.3.1 Study  VP-102-103: Phase  2 Study  Evaluating Safety,  Efficacy  and Systemic  
Exposure  after  VP-102 Treatment  in Subjects with  Childhood  Molluscum  
 
VP-102 in the proprietary applicator  was determined  to be safe in a 12-week,  open-
label, Phase 2 study (VP -102-103) implemented under Investigation New Drug (IND) 
application 131163/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. The primary objective of the study was to 
evaluate the potential  systemic  exposure  to cantharidin under  maximum use conditions  
(> 21 lesions treated). Subjects ≥ 2 years of age with molluscum contagiosum were  
enrolled and treated with VP -102 (a single -use proprietary applicator containing a  
novel 0.7% w/v cantharidin solution) every 21 days for up to 4 treatments or until  
complete  lesion  clearance.  Subjects  were instructed  to wash  VP-102 off at 24 hours, or 
earlier  if significant  pain or blistering.  Lesion  counts  and adverse events  (AEs),  
including local skin reactions (LSRs), were documented at each visit. Quality of life  
(QoL) was measured using the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI).  
A subset of 17 subjects with ≥ 21 MC lesions at baseline were evaluated for systemic  
exposure with 4 blood samples (pre -dose and at 2, 6, and [ADDRESS_677203] -dose). Key 
efficacy endpoints were percentage of subjects exhibiting complete clearance of all  
treated MC lesions (baseline and new) on or before Week 12 and percentage of  
reduction of  treated MC lesions from  baseline at  Week 12.  
 
The mean age was 6.7 (range 2 -15) years for the 33 subjects enrolled. The majority of  
subjects were male (54.5%), white (90.9%), and not Hispanic/Latino (93.9%), with a  
mean time since diagnosis of 36 days and no previous  treatment  for molluscum  
(60.6%).  
 
Treatment with VP -102 was well -tolerated. A total of 29 subjects (88%) reported at  
least one treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE), including expected LSRs such as  
blistering or erythema. Most subjects had mild TEAEs; 3 subjects had moderate  
TEAEs.  Overall,  21 (63.6%)  subjects  had TEAEs  related to  study  drug, most  of which  
were  LSRs.  There were  no serious  adverse events  (SAEs)  or TEAEs  leading to  
premature study withdrawal.  
 
Treatment  with VP-102 was associated  with significantly  reduced  lesion  count,  
improved QoL, and complete clearance of MC lesions. Sixteen (16) subjects (48.5%)  
achieved complete clearance of all MC lesions on or before Week 12. The median  
lesion count was reduced 98% from baseline to Week 12. Decreases in mean CDLQI  
composite  scores  were observed, from 2.58 (standard deviation =  3.446) at baseline  to

 0.38 (standard  deviation  =0.871)  at Week  12. No subjects  reported  spread  of 
molluscum  lesions to any  siblings during the study. 
 
Plasma drug levels were below the limit of quantitation in [ADDRESS_677204]  number  of lesions  (113 lesions  
treated)  nor in the  two subjects with genital involvement.  
 
In a separate double -blind, Phase 2 study (12- 01-004), topi[INVESTIGATOR_521967] (0.7% w/v)  
was well tolerated and  associated with the clearance of MC in 94 subjects with  
childhood molluscum.[15] 
 
4.3.2 Study  16-10-195: VP-102 Bridging  Study  of Subjects  with  Childhood Molluscum  
 
A bridging study (16- 10-195), conducted under IND #114032, was implemented to  
confirm VP -102’s similarity in safety and efficacy to a 0.7% compounded cantharidin 
formulation  used previously under  the same IND.  For this study, VP-[ADDRESS_677205] cohort investigated a 6- hour treatment duratio n. A 
second  cohort investigated a  24-hour treatment duration.  
 
In total,  30 subjects  were enrolled  with childhood molluscum,  14 subjects  in the 6-hour 
cohort  and 16 subjects  in the 24- hour cohort.  
 
VP-102 was safe and well tolerated in the treatment of pediatric molluscum with both  
a 6-hour and 24-hour duration of exposure  on the skin, consistent  with historically  used 
cantharidin formulations. There were no unexpected treatment -related AEs reported  
during application to molluscum lesions in 14 subjects in the 6- hour exposure cohort.  
Moreover, there  were no treatment -related  AEs reported  with application  to 712 lesions  
in 16 subjects in the 24- hour exposure  cohort.  
 
Overall, 11 out of 25 (44%) subjects showed complete clearance in t he Per -Protocol  
(PP) Population. The 6- hour and 24- hour application demonstrated similar tolerability  
and efficacy in this study. VP -102 was similarly effective compared to compounded  
cantharidin, as  evaluated  in Study 12-01-004.

 4.3.3 Cantharidin Study  in Subjects  with  Genital Warts  
 
One study of cantharidin for the treatment of genital warts has been published. A  
randomized, controlled trial of cantharidin was conducted in 12 patients  with non-
mucosal  genital  warts.[1] Patients  were  randomized to either  compounded cantharidin  
(n=6  patients  with 15 warts)  or TCA  (n=6  patients  with 14 warts)  treatment.  Cantharidin 
was applied to the skin and allowed to dry, covered with a transparent  adhesive 
waterproof film dressing, and after 4 to 6 hours, the treatment area was  washed with 
soap and water to control skin exposure. Cantharidin was more effective  and better  
tolerated  than TCA  for the treatment  of lesions. Complete  clearance of warts  occurred 
in 100% of patients treated with cantharidin and 66% of patients treated with TCA 
(P=0.45). Patients treated with cantharidin, compared to TCA, healed with less  
scarring  (P<0.034), had less pain during treatment  (P<0.01), and required  fewer  
treatments  to eradicate warts (P<0.01).  
 
4.[ADDRESS_677206] similar therapeutic  
benefits as subjects treated with VP -102 or 0.7% w/v cantharidin in previous clinical  
studies. Efficacy data for VP -102 and cantharidin are provided in Section 4.3 and  
described  in the IB. 
 
Approximately 80% of the subjects  enrolled  in Part A of this study will be randomized  
to receive VP -102. Approximately 60% of the subjects enrolled in Part B of this study 
will be  randomized to receive VP -102.

VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-[ADDRESS_677207] been conducted in subjects with genital warts, and thus  
the potential risks are uncertain. Safety and PK data for VP -102 are provided in  
Section 4.3 and described in the IB. Nonclinical data for VP -102 are presented in  
Section  4.2 and described  in the IB. Although the study drug will be labeled  exclusively  
for topi[INVESTIGATOR_521968], the formulation  also 
contains an oral deterrent (denatonium benzoate) to further help mitigate the risk of  
accidental  ingestion. 
 
The mechanism of action of cantharidin, when applied externally, is that of a vesicant  
(blistering  agent)  and can cause severe chemical  burns  at high concentrations.  
Cantharidin taken internally can be poisonous to humans. Cantharidi n is classified as  
an extremely  hazardous  substance  in the United  States  and is subject  to strict reporting 
requirements by [CONTACT_522021], store, or use it in significant quantities.[16] 
However, cantharidin can be safely and effectively used to treat some benign skin 
lesions when formulated properly and applied in the clinic topi[INVESTIGATOR_58015] a medical  
provider  familiar  with its effects and uses.[17] 
 
The most frequently reported AEs in clinical trials with VP -102 conducted in subj ects 
with MC were application site vesicles, application site scab, application site pain,  
application  site erythema,  and application  site pruritus.  These  are well-known,  
reversible reactions  of the skin that are related  to the mechanism  of action  of 
cantharidin, a  vesicant.  
 
4.4.3 Potential  Risks  
 
Cantharidin is a member of the Terpenoid Class. The Terpenoid Class is a large and 
diverse  class of naturally  occurring organic  chemicals derived from terpenes.  
 
Because there may be unknown and potential risks with administration of VP -102, all  
subjects  will be closely  monitored for safety  and tolerability  by [CONTACT_522022],  vital signs, and reporting of AEs.  
 
4.4.4 Risk -Benefit  Summary  
Overall,  based  on risk/benefit  analysis,  the current  study appears  to be fully  justified  in 
the planned population of subjects with genital warts.

 4.5 Justification  for Dosing  Regimen  
This study will evaluate VP-102, a controlled, highly- pure, standardized  form  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_521969] (GMP) to address the  
problems  associated  with currently  available compounded cantharidin  products  and the 
needs  of subjects  and medical professionals.  
 
A 0.7% w/v cantharidin solution is the recognized therapeutic dose of cantharidin for  
wart treatment in dermatological  clinical  practice.[7, 18-21] VP-102, a drug- device  
combination containing 0.7%  w/v cantharidin, was determined  to be safe and effective 
in two recently completed  double -blind,  randomized,  placebo -controlled, Phase 3 
studies  that enrolled  > 500 subjects  ≥ 2 years  of age with molluscum  contagiosum. The 
only published study of cantharidin for the treatment of genital warts demonstrated 
enhanced safety and efficacy with a 0.7% cantharidin solution applied for 4 to 6 hours  
with occlusion compared  to TCA.[1] Additionally, multiple  publications  have 
demonstrated safety and efficacy with a 0.7% cantharidin solution in common warts, 
both with and without the  use of surgical tape.[7, 18-24]. 
 
In this study, lesions will be covered with surgical tape, a technique often used in the  
treatment of warts with cantharidin. It is believed that this technique helps the drug  
penetrate into  the hyperkeratotic tissue and may result in improved efficacy. This will  
also eliminate unintentional transference of study drug to healthy tissue.  
 
Study drug will be applied in sufficient quantity to cover the entirety of each wart, including approximat ely a 1 mm  margin of surrounding, healthy skin. 
 
The duration of skin exposure to cantharidin, the active ingredient in VP -102, will be  
controlled in this study. In Part A, VP -102 will remain on the skin for up to 2 hours in  
group 1 and the exposure will be increased to 6 and 24 hours in subsequent groups  
based on the assessment of safety and tolerability. The duration of skin exposure will  
be modulated by [CONTACT_522023] -determined time per  
protocol or based on clinical response (e.g., significant blistering or pain), consistent  
with current  clinical  practice with the use of cantharidin  (directions  for use are provided 
in Section 8.2).[17] The 2 -hour duration of skin exposure was selected as the starting 
point based on a published clinical study with 0.7% cantharidin, which demonstrated  
favorable safety and efficacy with a 4 - to 6- hour treatment duration. The 6- hour and 
24-hour time periods  were selected  to allow  a safe and controlled step-wise increase in

 skin exposure  that would  be expected  to result  in a meaningful  increase in the 
pharmacodynamic  response  in the  skin (e.g., blistering).  
 
The dosing regimen for Part B will be selected based on the response observed in 
subjects  during the dose  regimen  finding performed in Part A.  
 
4.6 Population  to be Studied 
In this study, adult  subjects  ages 18 and  older, with  external  genital  warts  (EGW),  will 
be included. External genital warts are defined as warts located in the medial thigh  
(except  inguinal  fold);  supra -pubic, perineal,  and perianal  areas,  vulva  (excluding labia  
minora and mucosal surfaces), over the glans penis (excluding urethral meatus), penis  
shaft,  scrotum, and foreskin. 
 
4.7 Statement  of Compliance  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice  
(GCP), the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable regulatory 
and Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  or Independent  Ethics  Committee  (IEC)  
requirements.

 6.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
6.1 Description  of the  Study  
 
This is a Phase  2, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to determine  the dose 
regimen,  safety,  tolerability,  and efficacy  of VP-102 in subjects  with  EGW.  This study 
is divided into two parts (Part A and Part B). The Schedule of Assessments and 
Procedures  is presented in  Table 1.  
 
6.1.1 Part  A (dose  regimen  finding) Study  Design  
 
The aim of Part A is to determine the two best treatment regimens for evaluation of  
safety  and efficacy  in Part B.  
 
Treatment  regimens  will be evaluated  based  on the requirement  to form  blisters  in most  
patients, while maintaining a favorable safety and tolerability profile (e.g., majority of  
LSR AEs are mild or moderate in severity). Accordingly, increasing durations of skin exposure  to study drug (VP-102 or placebo)  will be evaluated  in three treatment groups  
(n=6/group)  that will enroll progressively.  
 
Subjects will have a Screening Period of up to [ADDRESS_677210] treatment, 
followed by a Treatment Period starting at Treatment Visit 1 and lasting through  
Treatment  Visit 4.  
 
Eighteen (18) subjects at up to six sites (additional sites may be added if required to  
ensure successful recruitment of the study population) will be enrolled, into either the  
2-hour (Group 1), 6 -hour (Group 2), or 24- hour (Group 3) treatment duration of skin 
exposure groups (n=6 subjects/group). Each group will include a minimum of two  
subjects from each sex and will be randomized 5:1 (VP -102:placebo) within each  
group. All subjects will receive either VP -102 (containing 0.7% cantharidin [w/v]  
topi[INVESTIGATOR_521961]- forming solution) or placebo. Warts are to be treated and then covered  
(unless  prohibited by [CONTACT_522035])  with transparent  surgical  tape (e.g., 3M™  
Blenderm™ brand) that will remain on the skin until the designated time for removal. 
Subjects will be asked to remove the surgical tape and study drug with soap and water  
after the pre -determined  duration of  skin exposure  for their group.

 Study drug (VP -102 or placebo) will be administered once every 21 ±[ADDRESS_677211]  completed  the 48-hour (±8 hours)  Visit.  The Safety  
Review Panel will determine whether enrollment can be initiated into the next Group,  
OR if more data (e.g., waiting for additional treatments for enrolled subjects or the  
addition of more subjects to a group) are needed prior to making a determination to  
open enrollment into  the next Group (i.e., the review  conducted after six subjects  have  
completed  Group 1 could open enrollment into Group 2 and the review after Group 2  
could open enrollment into Group 3). An additional blinded safety review of TEAEs, focusing on those of moderate or severe intensity, will be performed after all six 
subjects in Group [ADDRESS_677212] completed the 48- hour (±8 hours) Visit, in order to support  
dose selection for Part B (Safety and Efficacy). Safety Review Panel members are  
blinded to the  treatment assignment.  
 
6.1.2 Part  B (safety  and efficacy) Study  Design  
 
Part B of the study will b egin enrollment only after the Sponsor has selected the two  
dose regimens in Part A, which will be called VP -[ADDRESS_677213] be provided to the sites prior to Part B enrollment. The study will remain blinded until completion of both parts of the  
study. 
 
Approximately 90 subjects  at up to 9 sites (additional  sites  may  be added  if required  to 
ensure  successful  recruitment  of the study population)  will be enrolled  and randomized  
to one of four treatment arms. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_522036] ~60% of any treatment arm (e.g., placebo group for the 6- hour and  
24-hour wash -off cannot have any one gender ≥ 60%). Two of the treatment arms will  
be VP -102 Regim en 1 and VP -102 Regimen 2. The other two treatment arms will be  
placebo  (Placebo  Regimen  1 and Placebo  Regimen  2), with corresponding durations  of 
skin exposure  matching  those  selected  for VP-102 Regimen  1 and Regimen  2. As an

 example, if the regimens selected from Part A are the 2 -hour and 6- hour applications  
of VP -102, then VP -102 Regimen 1 would be VP -102 treatment for 2- hours and VP-
102 Regimen  2 would be VP-102 treatment for 6-hours. Likewise,  Placebo  Regimen 
1 would be placebo treatment for 2 hours and Placebo Regimen 2 would be  placebo 
treatment for 6 -hours. Randomization of the four treatment arms (VP -102 Regimen  
1:VP -102 Regimen  2: Placebo  Regimen  1:Placebo  Regimen  2) will be  3:3:2:2. 
 
In both Regimen  1 and Regimen  2, study drug will be administered  to EGW  once  every  
21 ±4 days for up to four applications. Subjects will be asked to remove the surgical  
tape and study drug with soap and water at the designated time selected from the dose  
regimen  findings in Par t A of the  study. 
 
6.1.3 Part  A and Part  B Procedures  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject  Participation  
 
Pre-study screening for eligibility (informed consent, demographics, physical exam, 
vital signs, prior and concomitant medications, and medical history) can occur up to  
14 days before,  or on the same day  as Treatment  Visit 1. The dermatologic  exam,  wart  
count, wart measurement  (diameter),  location  of all warts,  and photographs  (if 
applicable)  must  be repeated  at Treatment  Visit [ADDRESS_677214] measure ≤ 8 mm in diameter each with a total wart area  
(i.e., all warts combined) ≥ [ADDRESS_677215] be ≥ 2 and ≤ [ADDRESS_677216] of care. Subjects  
who meet the enrollment criteria will be randomized to receive VP -102 or placebo.  
Treatment  will continue  with a minimum of every  21 ±[ADDRESS_677217] cleared. The 24- hour, 7- day, and 14 -day evaluation of  
response to treatment (ERT) telephone follow -ups will be conducted per protocol for  
those  instances in which  the subject was treated.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  Procedures  
 
All required  study activities,  including an ERT (i.e., assessment  of wart activity  [count,  
location, diameter] and related LSRs), will be conducted per protocol. A Blinded 
Assessor will perform wart counts before the ERT assessment at Treatment Visit 2,  
Treatment  Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, End of  Treatment  Visit,  and Follow -up Visit.  
 
Treatment  visits  are to take place in order  (i.e., Treatment  1, Treatment  2, Treatment  3, 
and Treatment  4). All subjects  will receive application  of study  drug to EGW,  including  
an approximate margin of healthy surrounding skin, at an interval of every 21 ±4 days  
until complete  clearance of  all treatable warts,  or a maximum  of four  applications. 
 
No partial treatment of warts (e.g., treating one wart and not another) is permitted. In  
any instance where the clinician is uncertain if a residual wart is remaining, treatment  
should be applied. Instructions for application of the study drug are outlined in the  
Instructions for Use included in the drug shipment, as well as incl uded in the Site  
Regulatory Packet.  
 
Subjects should be re -treated only after 17 to 25 days (i.e., 21 ±4 days) have elapsed  
since  the previous  treatment  and only after any LSRs  have  resolved  sufficiently  to allow  
evaluation of the treatment site. Treatment should only take place at a visit when all  
warts are evaluable (i.e., not obscured by [CONTACT_61399]). All warts that are not  
completely clear should undergo treatment with study drug. Subjects exhibiting skin  
reactions that need additional time,  at the Investigator’s discretion, before they can be  
treated again will be evaluated and asked to return for their next treatment visit after  
the area is considered  sufficiently  resolved  to allow  for the next treatment  (e.g., ongoing  
dryness  or erythema  is appropriate  to treat).  See instructions  below  regarding  
unscheduled visits.  
 
Subjects who receive <[ADDRESS_677218]  misses a treatment  visit,  and 
is outside  the 4-day study  window, they  may return  and be treated  at the next  available 
opportunity with the subsequent visit scheduled 21 ±4 days after the actual treatment  
visit. No treatment should be administered after the treatment period without the  
Sponsor’s  approval.

 An ERT assessment will be conducted at each treatment visit (1 -4; in -person before  
treatment or via follow -up telephone cal ls) at 24 hours (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), 
and 14 days (±24  hours)  after  each treatment  visit (not “unscheduled”  visits).  Note  that 
the ERT telephone  calls at 24 hours  (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours)  and 14 days  
(±24 hours) are not required if there wa s no treatment during that period. In Part A  
Treatment Period 1 only, subjects will return to the clinic for an in- person ERT  
assessment  at 48 hours  (±8 hours)  after Treatment  Visit 1. The ERT  includes  questions  
related to removal of surgical tape and study drug (if applicable) and collects any new  
AEs,  LSRs,  and changes  in concomitant  medications  since the last contact.  The subject  
will be given an opportunity to ask questions  and review  any concerns. In the event  that 
any post -treatment LSR presents a safety concern (including but not limited to severe  
blistering,  ulceration,  edema,  or pain)  an “Unscheduled” clinic  visit must  be scheduled, 
and the subject assessed accordingly. In addition, if any post -treatment AEs present a 
safety concern, t he subject may be brought in for an unscheduled visit. The ERT  
assessments will be recorded by a research team member on the ERT form. The ERT  
visits  may not be conducted by a person designated as a Blinded Assessor.  Phone  calls 
conducted outside of the required study visits or required ERT assessments should be  
documented in the subject’s source note but are not required to be entered in the  
electronic data capture (EDC)  system.  
 
ERT assessments, wart count, and wart location will be conducted before tre atment  
application at all Treatment Visits 1 to 4, as well as at the EOT Visit on Study Day 84  
(0/+8  days)  and at the Follow -up Visits  on Study Day 112 (±7 days)  and Study Day 147 
(±7 days). Wart  measurement  will be conducted  before  treatment application  at 
Treatment  Visit 1, as well as at the EOT  Visit on Study Day 84 (–0/+8  days)  and at the 
Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 (±7 days) and Study Day 147 (±7 days). Subjects  
who clear  all warts  before  the Study Day 84 (EOT)  Visit will still be  required to return  
for each of the scheduled  in-person treatment  visits,  as well as the Study Day 84 (EOT)  
Visit, the Study Day 112 follow -up visit, and the Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit. A  
Provider Treatment Questionnaire will be completed at the Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit  
by a clinician who applied treatment to the subject during the course of the study. All  
subjects  will continue in the study for two additional  Follow -up Visits  on Study  
Day 112 and Study Day 147 (EOS).  
 
All treatment  visits  will include  a wart count, performed  before  treatment  (if applicable)  
and before ERT assessment. No treatment will be required if the wart is considered  
clear.  Genital  warts  that develop in areas  that are unable  to be treated,  (e.g., close to a

 mucous membrane) and other wart types (e.g., common warts) will not be evaluated,  
documented, or  considered in the  analysis.  
 
Wart counts will be conducted at the Screening Visit, Treatment Visit 1, Treatment 
Visit 2, Treatment Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, End of Treatment Visit, and Follow -up 
Visit by a trained member of the study team. Other than the screening visit and Day 1,  
wart counts will also be conducted by a member of the research team that has been 
identified  and trained  as a Blinded Assessor.  The Blinded Assessor  may be utilized  for 
a subject’s initial screening, enrollment and treatment Visit 1 activities, however, may  
not perform  any other  study  related  activities  other  than wart counts  at subsequent  visits  
(e.g., follow -up phone calls or unscheduled visits) for the same subject. The Blinded 
Assessor  is not required to be  the same person for  each assessment.  
 
It can sometimes be challenging to determine if a wart is completely clear after  
treatment due to ongoing LSRs. At any visit in which the Investigator is unable to  
evaluate or treat some warts due to ongoing LSRs, an “Unscheduled” visit should be  
documented. The timing of the next visit will be determined by [CONTACT_522037]. The research team should be in contact [CONTACT_522038] a treatment visit can be scheduled within 21 ±[ADDRESS_677219] at the clinical site at each treatment and  
follow -up study visit through Study Day 147 (±7 days; EOS). If there are no warts  
remaining, the same areas will be photographed and repeated at the Study Day 84  
(0/+8 days) EOT Visit and Study Day 147 (±7 days) EOS visit, regardless of whether  
warts are present. The images may be used on handouts in future trials, for training  
purposes, or futur e marketing materials. They will not be used for any portion of the  
efficacy or safety data. Photographs will be de -identified to those outside the research  
team and stored in a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  
compliant  manner.  Efforts  will be made to ensure  that no photographs  with identifiable  
features  are obtained.

Subjects will be provided with take home instructions describing what they might  
expect  throughout  the course  of the study, as well as recommendations  for wound care  
(if needed),  when  it is important  to call their doctor, and instructions  for who to contact  
[CONTACT_61400]. In the event that any post -treatment LSR presents a safety concern  
(including but not limited  to severe  blistering,  ulceration, edema,  or pain),  an 
“Unscheduled” clinic visit must be scheduled and the subject assessed accordingly. In  
addition, if any post-treatment  AEs present  a safety  concern,  the subject  may be brought  
in for an unscheduled visit. 
 
An LSR guide for subjects, with specific photographs representing the various skin  
reactions  and examples  of intensity,  will be provided and reviewed  in detail  at the clinic  
with the subject by [CONTACT_5051]. The LSR guide will be utilized for reference by  
[CONTACT_522004] -up telephone assessments with the research team  
member.  The final determination  of LSR parameters,  including intensity,  will be  made  
by [CONTACT_253475].  
 
6.2 Number  of Subjects  
 
In Part A, 18 subjects  will be enrolled  into one of three duration of skin exposure  groups  
(n=6 subjects/group). Each group will include a minimum of two subjects from each  
sex and will  be randomized 5:1 (VP -102:placebo)  within each  group.  
 
In Part B, 90 subjects will be enrolled, randomized to one of four treatment arms.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_522039] ~60% of any

7.4.3 Noncompliance  
 
After the Investig ator, the Medical Monitor and/or Study Monitor consult (and the  
Sponsor  if appropriate), a subject  may be discontinued from  the study  for the following  
administrative  reasons:  
 
• Failure  to receive study medication  or treatment  as mandated  by [CONTACT_522042] 8.0. 
 
• Failure  to comply with protocol requirements  
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_677239]  refusing  clinical  trial material  for any reason  will be discontinued from  the 
study, and the reason(s)  for their discontinuation will be documented on the appropriate  
eCRF page. Reasonable efforts should be made to monitor the subject for AEs and to 
complete follow -up assessments after treatment discontinuation. These efforts should 
be documented on the  appropriate  eCRF  page.  
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_677240]  who withdraws  consent  for any reason  at any time during the study will be 
discontinued from the study, and the reason(s) will be documented on the appropriate  
source and  eCRF page.  If subjects do not want their data that has already been  
submitted,  they will need  to submit  a request  in writing  to the Investigator  for removal  
of their information.

 7.5 Replacement  of Subjects  
 
Subjects  prematurely  withdrawn  from  the study as dropouts  (e.g., enrolled  in the study 
but never received study drug, did not complete the EOT and EOS assessments), for  
noncompliance, or who request  to be withdrawn  from  the study may be replaced  at the 
discretion  of the Sponsor. 
 
7.6 Premature Study  or Site Termination  
 
If the Sponsor,  Investigator, Medical  Monitor, Study Monitor, or appropriate  regulatory 
officials  discover  conditions  arising  during the study  that indicate  that the study should  
be halted  or that the site should be  terminated,  this action  may  be taken  by [CONTACT_522043], Investigator, Medical Monitor, and  
Study Monitor. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are  
not limited to, the  following:  
 
• The discovery of an unexpected,  serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects  
enrolled in the  study 
• A decision  on the part of the Sponsor  to suspend or discontinue  testing,  evaluation, 
or development of the product  
• Termination  of study conduct  at an individual  site may also be warranted  under  the 
following conditions:  
− Failure  of the Investigator  to enroll  subjects  into the study at an acceptable rate 
− Failure of the Investigator to comply with pertinent regulations of appropriate  
regulatory authorities  
− Submission of knowingly  false information  from  the site to the Sponsor, Study 
Monitor, or  appropriate  regulatory authority  
− Insufficient  adherence  to protocol  requirements  
 
Study termination  and follow -up will comply  with the conditions  set forth  in 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6, Guideline for GCP. Data from all  
sites, including those that have been terminated for non- compliance or unsatisfactory  
enrollment will be evaluated and included in the inter pretation of study findings.  
Subjects  from  sites that terminate  early  will be considered  for analysis.  If a subject  does 
not complete  the study, they  will still be  counted as a  failure  for the primary  endpoint.

 8.0 STUDY DRUGS  
 
8.1 Investigational  Agent  and Placebo  
 
The VP -102 single -use applicator contains 0.45 mL of 0.7% w/v cantharidin. The  
placebo single -use applicator is comprised of the same formulation as the VP -102 
applicator  but does not  contain  the active pharmaceutical  ingredient cantharidin. 
 
Although the study drug will be labeled  exclusively  for topi[INVESTIGATOR_521974], the 
formulation also contains an oral deterrent (denatonium benzoate) to further help 
mitigate  the risk of accidental  ingestion. The study  drug is light violet  to dark purple  in 
color  and has been manufactured under GMP.  
 
Each lot of applicators will be released for clinical use after a subset has undergone applicator suitability testing and demonstrated that they can deliver drug product in a  
controlled  manner,  without  leaking  or spi[INVESTIGATOR_17378]. After  the commercial  product  completes  
all required testing, they will be  released for  use in the  clinical study.  
 
8.2 Directions  for Use 
 
8.2.1 Application  of Study  Drug  and Surgical  Tape  
 
Study drug (VP-102 or placebo)  is contained  within  a single -use applicator.  Per 
protocol, one applicator  may  be used to treat all EGW  lesions  at each subject  treatment  
visit.  
 
Following examination, the product  is applied  to the skin as a viscous  solution, at which  
point the solvents evaporate, leaving behind a thin, flexible, and resilient film. Study  
drug will be applied in sufficient quantity to cover the entirety of each wart, including 
approximately a [ADDRESS_677241]  is completely  dry (approximately 2-5 min).  The size of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (or  pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928])  of 
surgical  tape used  is based  upon Investigator  discretion, provided that  all treated  warts  
are covered, and the surgical  tape size is deemed  sufficient  to maintain  adherence for

VP-102-[ADDRESS_677242] treatment, as long as it is within the 14- day 
screening  time period. Otherwise,  they will need  to be rescreened  and consent  reviewed  
to participate.  
 
All subjects will be provided a copy of their signed Informed Consent Form (ICF). At  
each treatment visit,  the subjects  will be provided with both verbal  and written  take-
home instructions covering potent ial side effects and complications, as well as  contact  
[CONTACT_522044]/  Coordinator  for any questions  or concerns that 
may arise. Subjects will also be provided an LSR guide to assist the site  in collecting  
the required  ERT  information related  to the treated  areas.  Subjects  should refrain from 
touching, licking, or biting treated skin or putting treated skin in or near  any mucosal 
surface including the mouth, nostrils, eyes, and anogenital area for up to 48 hours 
after treatm ent or until the study drug is removed. Strongly urge subjects not  to touch 
or wash the  treated area for the  assigned  duration of  skin exposure.  
 
Subjects  will receive application  of study drug to all warts  with a minimum of 
21 ±[ADDRESS_677243]  throughout  the course  of the study;  recommendations  for

VP-102-[ADDRESS_677244]  in an emergency.  
 
Surgical  tape should only be removed  at the designated  times  after study drug 
application, when the treatment site is  washed and  study drug removed. 
 
Subjects  are instructed  to wet  the surgical  tape in a bath  or shower  with water  and then 
slowly peel back an edge of the surgical tape, pulling the surgical tape over itself in a  
“low  and slow”  manner  to prevent  the unroofing of any blisters  that may have  
developed. Gently  remove  any remaining  study drug with soap and water.  Subjects  will 
be cautioned not to use washcloths, abrasive material, or vigorous rubbing to remove  
the study drug, as this may cause temporary pain and damage to the external layer of  
the skin and slow the healing process. Subjects are encouraged to wash their hands  
regularly with soap and water and discouraged from scratching lesions, which can  
spread  disease.  
 
Note: The surgical tape and study drug may be gently removed from individual warts  
before the designated time in the event of significant blistering, signific ant pain, or a  
TEAE. Study drug should not be removed from any remaining unproblematic warts  
until the designated removal time is reached. Subjects who remove study drug before  
the assigned time frame will be considered a protocol deviation, unless early r emoval  
is due to protocol defined  criteria.  
 
Early  removal is defined as removal of  study drug outside of the  following windows:  
 
• ±1-hour window  for 2 -hour duration of  skin exposure  group  
 
• ±2-hour window  for 6 -hour duration of  skin exposure  group  
 
• ±6-hour window for  24-hour duration of  skin exposure  group

be evaluated for impact by [CONTACT_522045]. Storage temperature excursion  
above  104°F  are not allowed  and will require  replacement  of the study drug. The study 
drug must be stored in a secure, dry location with limited and controlled access, and  
out of direct light. Extended exposure to extreme temperature conditions or to direct  
light should be avoided (e.g., study drug left in an unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_521977] a hot or cold  
environment). Contact  [CONTACT_522046]  (i.e., clinical research

9.7.4 Evaluation  of Response  to Treatment  Assessments 
 
An ERT assessment will be conducted at each treatment visit (1 -4; in-person before  
treatment or via follow -up telephone calls) at 24 hours (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), 
and 14 days (±24 hours) after each treatment visit (but not after “unscheduled” visits).  
Note  that the ERT  telephone  calls at 24 hours  (±6 hours), 7 days (±24  hours)  and 
14 days (±24 hours) after treatment are not required if there was no treatment during  
that period. In Part A Treatment Period 1 only, subjects will return to the clinic for an  
in-person ERT assessment  at 48  hours  (±8 hours) after Treatme nt Visit 1. 
 
The ERT includes questions related to removal of surgical tape and study drug (if  
applicable) and collects any new AEs, LSRs, and changes in concomitant medications  
since the last contact. The subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions and review  any concerns.

 10.0 ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
 
10.1 Safety  Parameters  
 
Safety analyses will include AEs, LSRs, medical history, physical examinations, vital  
signs, and concomitant medication use  
 
• The incidence of AEs will be assessed throughout the study; AEs will include all  
LSRs, whether or not they are expected  or related to study drug mechanism of  
action.  
 
• LSRs of all previously treated areas will be assessed at each treatment visit using  
the protocol specific  ERT form  
 
• Limited physical examinations will be completed before the first treatment and at 
the Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit; additional  physical  examinations  will be performed  
when clinically warranted (e.g., subject reports symptoms classified as an AE  
requiring further evaluation)  
 
• Vital signs (temperature and heart rate) will be obtained before the treatment is  
applied  at each treatment  visit and at  the start of the  Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit  
 
• Concomitant  medication  use will be collected  at each study visit and ERT telephone  
contact  
 
10.2 Definitions  
 
10.2.1 Adverse Event  
 
The following definition  of AE will be  used for  this study:  
 
Adverse  event  means  any untoward medical  occurrence associated  with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether  or not  considered drug related . 
 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or  
exacerbated)  tempo rally associated  with the use of the investigational product,  
regardless  of whether it  is considered to be  related  to the investigational  product.

 The following are  examples of AEs:  
 
• Exacerbation  of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including an 
increase in frequency  or intensity of the condition 
 
• New  conditions  detected  or diagnosed after  investigational  product  administration,  
even if they  were present  before  the start of the  study 
 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction with another  
medical  product  
 
• Local skin  reactions (erythema, scaling/flaking/dryness, edema/swelling, small  
blisters,  hyper - and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scabbing/crusting, erosion/ulcerations,  
scarring,  ring warts)  
 
• Development  of individual  blisters  that are >  25 mm in diameter  (the diameter  of a 
quarter); an aggregated blister composed of a number of smaller blisters is not  
considered  a severe blister  
 
• Blistering  distal to  the treatment  site 
 
• Scarring -independent  of any pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491];  include  depressed  (atrophic)  and 
elevated  (hypertrophic)  
 
• Secondary  infection  
 
The following are NOT  examples of AEs:  
 
• Medical procedures (The medical condition that led to the procedure as the AE  
should be  reported.)  
 
• Situations that are unwanted by [CONTACT_522051], for example social inconvenience after admission to a  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of a pre -existing disease or co ndition (present  
or detected before enrollment) that does  not worsen overall

 • Expected  progression of  the disease being  studied, including signs  or symptoms  of 
the disease, unless progression is more severe than expected for the subject’s  
condition. 
 
AEs may include pre -treatment or post -treatment events that occur as a result of  
protocol -mandated  procedures  (e.g.,  invasive  procedures,  modification  of the subject’s  
previous therapeutic regimen). AEs should be captured even if they occur during  
periods without drug treatment or post -treatment periods. AE collection begins after  
the subject  has signed informed consent  and will continue  until  the EOS  visit has  been  
completed.  
 
The Investigator and study personnel will note all AEs mentioned by [CONTACT_522052]  (Study  
Day 147). All clinical  complaints  volunteered by [CONTACT_522053].  
 
All unresolved AEs will be followed until the condition resolves and/or stabilizes, the  
subject is lost to follow -up or 30- days after the EOS visit, whichever comes first. All  
AEs will be summarized in the a nnual report or more frequently if requested by [CONTACT_522054]. SAEs require special reporting in addition to documentation in the  
eCRF  as described in  Section 10.6. 
 
10.2.2 Serious  Adverse Event  
 
In this study, an SAE  is defined as  an AE  that meets  any of the following criteria:  
 
• Results  in death  
 
• Is life-threatening  
 
− The term life-threatening in the definition  of an SAE  refers  to an event  in which  
the subject was at risk of  death at the time  of the event  
 
− The term life-threatening does not refer to an event  that hypothetically might  
have  caused death if it were more  severe

VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  83  
 • Requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62002] a prolongation of  an existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 
− In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_521979]’s office  or out -patient setting.  
 
− Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084], but not necessarily 
SAEs.  
 
− An occurrence or complication that prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61375]. When 
there is doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51956], the AE  
should be  considered  an SAE.  
 
− Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120874] a preexisting condition that did not  
worsen  from its  original  baseline level is  not considered an SAE.  
 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct  normal life  functions  
 
− This definition is not intended to include AEs of relatively minor medical  
significance  such as uncomplicated  headache,  nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea,  
influenza and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere or  
prevent  everyday life functions but do not constitute  a substantial disruption. 
 
• Another  important  medical  event  
 
− Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised when deciding whether  
reporting is appropriate for other important medical events that may not result  
in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_521980].  
− These events  should also be considered  serious.  
 
− Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at  
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not  
result  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

VP-102-[ADDRESS_677256] address the Investigator’s estimate of causality. The Medical  
Monitor  will review  the SAE  to determine  if it is an expected  SAE  (i.e., whether  or not 
the SAE is identified  in nature, severity,  and frequency  in the  VP-102 IB). 
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_677257] label (if applicable) or the current IB. The expectedness of an SAE will be  
assessed  by [CONTACT_522055].  
 
10.3 Assessment  of Intensity  
 
The Investigator will assess the intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the  
study. The assessment  will be  based  on the  Investigator’s  clinical  judgment. 
 
The classifications  in Table [ADDRESS_677258]  from  performing  normal  everyday  activities  
AE: adverse event.  
 
 
Any AE that changes in intensity during its course will be recorded in the eCRF at the  
highest  level  experienced  by [CONTACT_423].  
 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a  
category used for rating the intensity of an AE (such as mild, moderate, or severe  
myocardial infarction). However, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical  
significance,  such as a severe headache.  Both AEs and SAEs  can be assessed  as severe.  
An AE is considered serious (an SAE) when it meets one of the predefined outcomes  
described  in Section  10.2.2.

assessment of causality for every SAE before the transmission of the SAE report. The  
Investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_61380] -up 
information, with subsequent amendment of the SAE report. Causality assessment is  
one of the criteria used to determine regulatory reporting requirements and should not  
be left blank in the SAE report. The same applies to AEs that are to be processed as  
SAEs.  Some definitions to use  in the assessment are provided in  Table 5 . 
 
Table  5. Assessment  of Causality of  AEs  
Term  Definition  
Definitely  related  The AE is clearly  related to  the investigational  agent(s)  or research  intervention:  the 
AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s)  
or research  intervention  and follows  a known pattern  of response,  and no alternative  
cause  is present.  
Possibly  related  The AE may be related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention: the AE has a  
temporal  relationship  to the administration  of the investigational agent(s)  or research  
intervention  and follows  a suspected  pattern  of response,  but an alternative  cause  is 
present.  
Probably  related  The AE is likely related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention: the AE has a  
temporal  relationship  to the administration  of the investigational agent(s)  or research  
intervention  and follows a  known or suspected pattern of response, but  an 
alternative  cause  may be present.  
Unrelated  
(or not related)  The AE is clearly  not related  to the investigational  agent(s) or  intervention:  the AE  
has no temporal  relationship  to the administration  of the investigational agent(s)  or 
research  intervention,  and follows no known or suspected  pattern  of response,  and 
an alternative  cause is present.

 10.5 Recording  Adverse Events  and Serious  Adverse Events  
 
When  an AE or SAE  occurs,  the Investigator  is responsible  for reviewing  all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120876], laboratory,  and diagnostic  reports) 
relative to the event(s). The Investigator will record all relevant information about any 
AE (including SAEs) on the AE page of the  eCRF.  It is not acceptable for the  
Investi gator  to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_521981]’s  medical  records  in lieu of the properly 
completed AE or SAE pages of the eCRF. These documents should not be sent unless  
they are specifically requested by [CONTACT_152163]. If this request  
occurs,  all subject  identifiers  and protected  health  information should be blinded on the 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_521982].  
 
The Investigator  will also attempt to report  a diagnosis, instead  of signs, symptoms,  or 
other clinical information, for the AE. The diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, should be documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF as the AE or  
SAE.  In addition, SAEs  need  to be reported  in the SAE  report.  AEs being processed  as 
SAEs  will also require  additional documentation. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_677260] be reported to the Sponsor or  
designee within 24 hours of the time the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE  
(Table 6).

Urgent  reporting of SAEs  is required for  the following reasons:  
 
• To enable the Sponsor  to fulfill the reporting requirements  to the appropriate  
regulatory authority  
 
• To facilitate  discussion between  the Sponsor  and the Investigator  about  appropriate  
follow -up measures (if necessary)

 • To facilitate  the Sponsor’s  rapid  dissemination  of information  about  AEs to other  
Investigators  or sites in a  multicenter  study  
 
• To facilitate  reporting  unanticipated  problems  involving risk to subjects  to the IRB.  
The SAE  report  must  be completed  as thoroughly as possible, including the following:  
• Subject  identification  information  
 
• Event  term  
 
• All available details  about the  SAE  
 
• Causality  of each SAE  
 
• Signature  [CONTACT_522075]  24 hours  of awareness  of a new SAE,  the investigative  site will call the Paidion 
Research  Medical  Monitor  (xxxxx)  by [CONTACT_522056].  The SAE  
Hotline  may be accessed  and is monitored  24 hours/day, 7 days/week.  The 
investigative  site must  also initiate  entry  of the SAE  report  form into  the EDC  system  
being used for this study. The SAE  report  should include  the essential  elements.  
 
The SAE  report  will be forwarded  to the Sponsor  within  the designated  time frames.  If 
additional  information  to complete  the SAE  report  form  is needed,  the Investigator  will 
not wait before  notifying the Paidion Medical  Monitor  of the SAE  via the SAE  Hotline.  
The SAE report form will be updated by [CONTACT_522057].

• The condition resolves and/or  stabilizes  
 
• The subject is lost to  follow -up 
 
• 30-days after the EOS visit

personnel  must  report  the pregnancy  to the Sponsor’s  Medical  Monitor  within  [ADDRESS_677264] be  reported  to the Medical Monitor. 
 
10.9 Special  Safety  Considerations  
 
• Investigators  should confirm  that study drug is completely  dry (2-5 minutes)  before  
applying the surgical tape or allowing the treated areas to come into contact [CONTACT_522058], clothing, furniture, or other surface  areas.  
 
− In addition, an adhesive bandage may be applied over the surgical tape to keep  
it in place on areas that have a high probability of transference to healthy skin, 
mucous  membranes,  or that may experience significant  flexing as in a skin fold. 
 
• VP-102 is considered highly flammable, even after drying. Subjects should avoid  
fire, flame, or smoking until study  drug has been  removed from the skin.

VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  89  
 • Cantharidin  has been  shown  to be safe for topi[INVESTIGATOR_175647], but is highly  toxic  if ingested.  
To deter potential oral ingestion, a bitter compound has been added to the study  
drug. 
 
• Subjects should refrain from sexual activity involving the treated area as well as  
touching, licking, or biting treated skin or putting treated skin in or near any 
mucosal  surface  including the mouth, nostrils,  eyes,  and anogenital  area for at least 
48 hours after treatment  or until the  study drug is removed.  
 
• Subjects are encouraged to wash their hands regularly with soap and water (being  
mindful  to keep  treated  areas  on the hands  dry) and discouraged from  scratching  or 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_61344], which  can spread disease

 11.0 ASSESSMENT  OF EFFICACY  
 
11.1 Efficacy  Parameters  
 
Efficacy parameters will be recorded for all enrolled subjects in the Intent -to-Treat  
(ITT) and PP Populations by [CONTACT_91727]. Clinical response to treatment will  
be evaluated at each scheduled visit until EOS by [CONTACT_61450]. Genital 
warts that develop in areas that are unable to be treated, (e.g., close to a mucous  
membrane)  and other  wart types  (e.g.,  common warts) will not be evaluated,  
documented, or  considered in the  analysi s. 
 
Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint:  
 
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting complete clearance of all treatable warts at the  
Study Day 84 (EOT)  Visit 
 
Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints:  
 
• Proportion of subjects  exhibiting  complete  clearance of all treatable warts  (baseline

VP-102-[ADDRESS_677265] disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, and study drug exposure  
will be summarized. The data will be summarized in tables, as appropriate, sho wing  
the number of subjects with non- missing data (n), mean, standard deviation, median,  
minimum, and maximum for continuous data and showing counts and percentage for  
categorical  data. Data will also  be listed as deemed appropriate.  
 
Summaries of data fro m subjects enrolled in Part A will be pooled with corresponding 
subjects  in Part B. For  instance,  if one of the two regimens selected  for Part B is the 6- 
hour application  of VP-102, then results  from  subjects  who received  the 6-hour 
application of VP -102 from Part A will be pooled with results from subjects who 
received  the 6 -hour application of  VP-102 from Part B.  
 
An additional set of tables will be generated that summarize subjects from Part A of  
the study who are not used in Part B of the study. Summary statistics for continuous  
variables  and counts  and percentages  for categorial  variables  will be shown by 
[CONTACT_3148]. However, due to the limited number of subjects for this set of tables  
(expected  n=6), analyses  to be  carried out will only  be descriptive  in nature. 
 
12.1 Analysis  Populations  
 
• The Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Population will  include  all randomized  subjects  
 
• The Safety  Population will include  all randomized  subjects  who receive 
≥ 1 application of  study drug (VP-102 or  placebo)  
 
• The Per -Protocol (PP) Population will include all subjects who receive all planned  
treatments of study drug (e.g., complete up to four treatments within the Day 75 
treatment window or clear before Day 75), had no major protocol violations, and  
were assessed fo r clearance at the  Study Day 84 (–0/+8 days)  EOT  Visit 
 
12.[ADDRESS_677266] dropout rates will be tabulated at  
the Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit and the Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit. Data will be  
summarized  using descriptive  statistics  (sample size, mean,  median, standard 
deviation, minimum,  maximum)  for continuous  variables  and frequencies,  and

VP-102-[ADDRESS_677267]  data listings  will be 
tabulated.  
 
12.3 Efficacy  Analyses  
 
Efficacy  will be  evaluated in the  ITT and PP Populations by [CONTACT_2948]. 
 
At the end of the study, Part B tables will be generated that pool subjects from Part A  
and Part B. The regimens included in these tables will be VP -102 Regimen 1, VP -102 
Regimen 2, Placebo Regimen 1, and Placebo Regimen 2 ( Section 6.1.2). For the  
efficacy endpoints ( Section 11.1), summary statistics for continuous variables and 
counts  and percentages  for categorical  variables  will be presented.  In addition, 
statistical comparisons will be carried out to compare VP -102 Regimen 1 to Placebo 
Regimen 1 and VP -102 Regimen 2 to Placebo Regimen 2. Comparisons made within 
Regimen 1 (VP -102 vs Placebo) will be independent of comparisons made within 
Regimen  2. Comparisons  may be carried  across  Regimens;  however,  no formal  
statistical testing  will be carried  out with comparisons  being  considered  only 
observational.  
 
An additional set of tables will be generated that summarize subjects from Part A of  
the study who are not used in Part B of the study. Summary statistics for continuous  
variables  and counts  and percentages  for categorial  variables  will be shown by 
[CONTACT_3148]. However, due to the limited number of subjects for this set of tables  
(expected  n=6), analyses  to be carried out will  only be descriptive  in nature. 
 
12.4 Safety  Analyses  
 
Safety  analyses  will be conducted in the Safety  Population by [CONTACT_522059].  
 
Adverse  events,  including LSRs,  will be coded with the Medical  Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA®) Version  20.0. The number  and percentage of 
subjects  having  TEAEs  will be tabulated  by [CONTACT_522060] a breakdown by [CONTACT_1570]. A subject -by-subject AEs data listing,  
including verbatim  term,  preferred  term,  treatment,  severity,  location, and causal  
relationship to the study drug will be provided. The number of subjects experiencing 
TEAEs and number of TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_522061].

 Any AE with an onset  date after the EOS  visit will be considered  off study and will not 
be included in tables summaries (although they will appear in AE listings). Each AE  
will be counted only once for a given subject. If the same AE occurs on multiple  
occasions for a subject, the occurrence with the highest severity and relationship to  
study drug will be reported. If two or more AEs are reported as a unit, the individual  
terms  will be  reported  as separate events.  
 
Changes in vital signs  (temperature and heart rate) , from baseline to EOS, will be  
examined. Treatment -emergent changes from normal values to abnormal values will  
be identified.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_677268] been performed, it is expected that a  
sample size of 18 subjects in Part A and 90 subjects in Part B, evaluable at the Study  
Day 84 (–0/+8  days)  EOT Visit,  will be infor mative  regarding  wart clearance rates  that 
can support assumptions in subsequent placebo- controlled trials.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_677269]  an assessment  of complete  clearance of  all treatable  warts  at 
the EOS visit (Study Day 84) will be considered to have missing data for the primary 
endpoint. The primary  method to handle  missing  data will be to assign  all subjects  with 
missing  complete clearance data as not  having achieved  complete clearance.  
 
In the event a subject requests to be removed from the study due to study- related  
adverse experiences or additional spreading of disease, data will be collected and  
analyzed as a treatment failure and the subject may be replaced. Further discussion of  
how treatment failure will be utilized in analysis will be provided in the Statistical  
Analysis  Plan.  
 
The procedures for handling missing data for other study endpoints will be described  
in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

 16.0 QUALITY CONTROL  AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Written SOPs will be followed to ensure that the study is conducted and data are  
generated,  documented (recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  
and the applicable regulatory requirements. Quality control will be applied to each 
stage of data handling. Regular monitoring, as defined in ICH GCP, Section 1.8, “The  
act of overseeing the progress of a clinical trial, and of ensuring that it is conducted, recorded,  and reported  in accordance with the protocol, SOPs,  GCP,  and the applicable  
regulatory requirement(s)”,  will be  conducted throughout  the conduct  of the study.  
 
The purpose  of monitoring is to verify  that: 
 
• Rights  and well -being of the human subjects are protected  
 
• The reported  study data are accurate,  complete,  and verifiable  from  source  
documents  
 
• The conduct  of the study is in compliance with the currently  approved  
protocol/amendment(s),  with GCP,  and with the applicable  regulatory requirements  
 
• Monitoring  is an integral  role in the quality  control  of a clinical  trial and is designed 
to verify  the quality  of the  study 
 
To fulfill the Quality Assurance requirements of GCP, audits will be conducted to  
assess and assure the reliability and integrity of a study’s quality control systems and  
recognized  standards.  
 
The purpose  of an audit is to:  
 
• Ensure  participant safety  
 
• Assure  compliance  to study protocol  procedures, regulatory requirements,  and

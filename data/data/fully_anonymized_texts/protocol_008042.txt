 1.0  Objectives   
The hypothesis of this study is that participants ≥[ADDRESS_576290] better outcomes  with a transplant approach followed 
by [CONTACT_43249] , as primarily measured by [CONTACT_16625], but also by [CONTACT_70112], versus non -transplant 
approaches.  
Primary Objectives  
 
1.1     To evaluate the progression -free survival  (PFS)  from the start of DPACE for all  
    participants who have had at least one day of  protocol  treatment . It is hoped that the  
    median progression -free survival will be 48 months  versus 24 to 36 months for non -     
    transplant regimens .   
 
1.2    To evaluate how well such therapy is tolerated in patients mainly over the age of 65 years  
                   by [CONTACT_452099] ( ICU admission, death) and the percentage of  
                   participants  able to complete the full  course of  therapy.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
          1.[ADDRESS_576291] -transplant using the European Organization for   
                   Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire  
                   QLQ -C30 and QLC -MY20.  
 
 Overall Survival (OS) is not an objective of this study because it is  heavily influenced by [CONTACT_452100] a fter relapse, and therefore becomes a confounding variable. However,   
 OS data will be collected and assessed.   
 
2.0   Background and Rationale  
2.1  Background   
Although recent tandem autologous transplantation clinical trials for newly di agnosed patients ha ve 
projected survivals of 10+ years and complete remission rates of approximately 80%, not every newly 
diagnosed (defined as <12 months of prior therapy) multiple myeloma patient will have the option of 
receiving  tandem transplant s, either becau se of a lack of insurance approval for two transplants , or 
because of clinical comorbidities that make the administration of two transplants unsafe. Most of 
these patients  that fall into this category  are ≥65 years of age, and in 2009, t he median age of 
diagnosis for myeloma  was 70 years .  
There continues to be clear evidence in the literature that supports the superiority of a single 
autologous transplant over non -transplant  chemotherapy, including chemotherapy combinations that 
employ the newer drugs (Lenalidomide, thalidomide, bortezomib, and Doxil).  There is also convi ncing 
evidence that post -transplantation ther apy with either thalidomide or Revlimid or the combination o f 
bortezomib with thalidomide prolongs the progression -free survival .   However, most of the literature 
Page 7 of 74 
 related to myeloma treatment in patients ≥65 years of age involves non -transplant chemotherapy 
regimens. The literature related to autologous transplant ation for myeloma in  the elderly (i.e. ≥ 65 
years of age) is scarce.     
Our group was the first to recognize that age is not a prognostic variable with autotransplants in 
myeloma (Siegel DS et al). While 83% of younger patients collected > 5 million CD34 cells/kg, 73% of 
patients 65 years or older attained this target (p= 0.2). The treatment -related mortality with the first 
transplant was 2% for younger patients, and 8% for patients 65 years or older. In multivariate analysis 
age was not a prognostic facto r for either event -free (p=0.2) or overall survival (p=0.8). These 
observations were subsequently confirmed in another single institution study by [CONTACT_452101] (2011) 
comparing 82 elderly patients to 104 younger patient. The feasibility of transplantati on in myeloma 
patients 70 years or older was also demonstrated by [CONTACT_452102].  
The table  on the next page , taken from Gay and Palumbo’s 2011 review  in Blood1, summarizes the 
results of various regimens used as frontline treatment in elderly patients diagnosed with multiple 
myeloma:

The design of this protocol centers around a single autologous transplant followed by [CONTACT_452103] ≥65 years of age with <12 months of prior therapy  in order to 
compare event -free and overall survival rates  to those in the literature cited above  .   
2.2 The Rationale for Adding Bortezomib and Thalidomide to H igh-Dose M elphalan  
In addition to traditional mechanisms of drug resistance such as overexpres sion of efflux pumps, up -
regulation of anti -apoptotic factors, down -regulation of proapoptotic factors, up -regulation of 
detoxifying enzymes and subcellular redistribution of drug targets, drug resistance is also mediated 
by [CONTACT_452104]. This type of drug resistance is called cell 
adhesion -mediated drug resistance (CAM -DR) and is particularly relevant in hematologic 
malignancies such as multiple myeloma, where the myeloma cells interact with the bone marrow 
stroma , initiating the production of proteins that stimulate and support tumor cell survival. Myeloma 
cells bind to fibronectin in the micro -environment, which up -regulates drug resistance mainly through 
increased NF -κB activity.  Bortezomib blocks the paracrine  growth of myeloma cells by [CONTACT_452105] -κB activity (Hideshima). In addition, 
bortezomib prevents DNA repair, which is the major mechanism of drug resistance to high dose 
melphalan. The Fanconi an emia (FA)/BRCA genes are overexpressed and cause drug resistance in 
melphalan -resistant cell lines. This pathway is activated by [CONTACT_153542] -κB. Bortezomib drastically reduces 
FA/BRCA gene expression and FANCD2 protein expression in myeloma cells, resulting in dimi nished 
DNA repair and enhanced melphalan sensitivity (Yarde et al). Thalidomide directly induces apoptosis 
or G1 growth arrest in myeloma cells, which are resistant to melphalan. Although thalidomide does 
not alter adhesion of myeloma cells to the bone mar row stroma, it inhibits the up -regulation of IL -6 
and VEGF secretion triggered by [CONTACT_452106]. It also 
inhibits TNFα -induced NF - κB. TNFα increases myeloma cell adhesion to the bone marrow stroma 
(Hideshima). Our own studies have demonstrated that the combination of bortezomib with 
thalidomide induces higher response rates than each drug separately. When analyzing the bone 
marrow stroma signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_25071], multiple genes were different between a  
normal bone marrow stroma signature [CONTACT_452150] a myeloma bone marrow stroma. However, after 
treatment for [ADDRESS_576294] combined high-dose melphalan with bortezomib. They concluded that this 
combination is safe and that there was a suggestion of improved efficacy (Lonial et al; Roussel et al; 
Thompson et al).   
Palumbo et al combined intermediate dose melphalan (100mg/m2) with bortezomib, thalidomide, and 
dexamethasone in 26 relapsed/refractory patients who had all received at least one prior transplant  
 [13 (50%) received a second transplant as salvage prior to study enrollment].  Responses occurred 
in 17/26 patients, in cluding 1 CR, 3 nCR(12%), and 2 VGPR (8%). Response rate was higher tha n 
that induced by [CONTACT_452107] 12 patients (46%).  The authors concluded that the 
regimen had encouraging anti -myeloma activity in heavily pre -treated patients, and  that the addition 
of thalidomide and bortezomib  only slightly increased overall toxicity caused by [CONTACT_452108] 
100mg/m2 as a single agent.  Infections requiring IV antibiotics occurred in 50% of patients, but it was 
not clear whether this was due to the immunomodulatory effect of the added agents or the infection 
susceptibility in heavily pre -treated patients.    
 
Barlogie et al reported in 2009 on the incorporation of bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone  with 
the addition of  cisplatin, and rapamycin into the BEAM regimen as a salvage regimen in myeloma.  
Ninety -five patients were enrolled in their study.  Patient characteristics included age >=65, 19%; 
LDH>ULN, 43%; CA, 67%; GEP high -risk, 44%; GEP MF, 15%; GEP delTP53, 22%; prior AT, 75% 
including 46% with 2  AT and 12% with 3 AT. CR and near -CR status was documented in 50%; TRM 
occurred within 100 days in 6%. Three -year estimates of overall survival (OS) and event -free survival 
(EFS) were 34% and 18%; OS/EFS were superior: (a ) without CA – 60%/50% versus 15%/5% with 
CA (p=0.003/0.0005); (b) with GEP low -risk – 55%/20% versus 10%/15% with high -risk MM 
(p=0.009/0.01); (c) with GEP hyperdiploidy and low bone disease molecular subgroups – 70%/35% 
versus 20%/10% in the remainder (p =0,001/0.002); and (d) absence of progression prior to SB – 
52%/35% versus 16%/5% for the remainder (p=0.002/0.0006).  They concluded that Super -BEAM 
(SB) was safe as a salvage regimen and well -tolerated by [CONTACT_452109] 12 of 74 
 settin g.  Although SB was very beneficial for a subset of the study patients, p re-SB relapse (relapse 
just prior to SB) was one of the significant ly adverse variables for OS and EFS, which is why we 
would like to incorporate VTD -Mel upfront in newly diagnosed pa tients.    
2.[ADDRESS_576295] -transplantation versus placebo (p ˂ 
0.001). Median follow up was only 30 months , which is too short to see a difference in overall survival 
(Attal et al, 2012). A second study by [CONTACT_452110] 460 patients and had a median follow -
up of 34 months also showed a significant benefit in progression -free survival with lenalidomid e 
maintenance compared to placebo (p<0.001). In spi[INVESTIGATOR_452055] -up, this study also showed 
an overall benefit for lenalidomide maintenance (p=0.03). It should be mentioned that both studies 
noted increased toxicities related to maintenance therap y and more specifically showed a significant  
incre ase in secondary  malignancies in the lenalidomide arms, which was 3.1 versus 1.2 per 100 
patient years in the Attal study, and 8% versus 3% in the McCarthy study. A recent consensus on 
maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma was reported by [CONTACT_452111]. Thalidomide maintenance 
showed a benefit in progression -free survival in all 6 studies performed and an overall survival benefit 
in 3 of these studies.  In a randomized Phase III study, superior complete (C R)/near complete 
response (nCR) and extended progression -free survival were demonstrated with bortezomib -
thalidomide -dexamethasone (VTD) versus thalidomide -dexamethasone (TD) when give as induction 
and maintenance therapy after transplantation in newly dia gnosed myeloma patients by [CONTACT_452112]. The study included 321 patients. VTD maintenance significantly increased CR/nCR rates 
while TD did not. With a median follow -up of 30 months from the start of maintenance, progression -
free survival at 3 years  was 60% versus 48% (p= 0.04). The benefit of VTD maintenance was seen 
irrespective of poor prognostic variables.  In ne wly diagnosed myeloma patients, lenalidomide / 
dexamethasone (RD)  was compared to  cyclophosphamide/lenalidomide/dexamethasone (CRD) and 
bortezomib/cyclophosphamide/ dexamethasone (VCD). VCD resulted in superior responses and less 
frequent serious toxicities compared to RD and CRD. With a median follow -up of [ADDRESS_576296] 
of 12 cycles of 28 days each. During year 1, we will administer VTD, while in year 2 we will administer 
VCD.  We consider it of vital importance that pati ents are able to complete two years of maintenance.  
However, b ecause of anticipated toxicity during maintenance, we allow alternate dosing schedules, 
dose reductions, or replacement with a similar categorical  agent (i.e. proteasome inhibitor with a

as possible will complete the  two years of maintenance therapy,  and with [ADDRESS_576297] different and better toxicity profile s, the experience with these drugs is still limited.  
Several myeloma physicians now advocate continuing therapy until relapse . We prefer to stop all 
treatment after two years of maintenance because: 1) Patients  value  the amount of time without 
symptoms, therapy , and toxicity 2) If t herapy is  continued until relapse, these drugs will by [CONTACT_452113], while it is our experience that in patients relapsing more than 2 years 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_452056] l treatment, the drugs given during maintenance remain effective 3) There is a clear 
association between prolonged use of IMIDS and secondary malignancies, including MDS and AML.  
3.0   Drug Information  
3.1 Bortezomib  (Velcade)  
Bortezomib for injection is a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution and is supplied in vials 
containing bortezomib and mannitol at a 1:10 ratio.  For example, vials containing 3.5  mg of 
bortezomib contain 35  mg of mannitol.   
Vials containing lyoph ilized bortezomib for injection should be stored refrigerated at 2° to 8 C.  To 
date, stability data indicate that the lyophilized drug product is stable for at least [ADDRESS_576298] of the study.  
Bortezomib is cytotoxic. As with all cytotoxic drugs, caution is required when preparing and handling 
bortezomib solutions.  Cytotoxic drugs shou ld only be handled by [CONTACT_452114]. The use of gloves and other appropriate protective clothing is 
recommended.  
Study drug will be supplied in sterile, single use vials containing 3.5 mg of bortezomib.  Each vial of 
bortezomib for Injection should be reconstituted under a laminar flow biological cabinet (hood) within 
eight hours before dosing with 3.5 mL of normal (0.9%) saline, Sodium Chloride Injection USP, so 
that the reconstituted solution contains bo rtezomib at a concentration of 1  mg/mL.  Dissolution is 
completed in approximately [ADDRESS_576299] been treated with 
bortezomib, including participants treated through Millennium -sponsored clinical trials, Investigator -
Page 14 of 74 
 Initiated Studies, the US NCI C ancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with commercially 
available drug. Bortezomib has been commercially available since 13 May 2003.  
The overall goal of the Millennium phase 1 program was to determine the MTD and dose -limiting 
toxicity (DLT) of VEL CADE in a number of therapeutic settings involving subjects with various 
advanced malignancies.  In a Phase I trial in participants with refractory hematologic malignancies, 
the MTD for a twice weekly for 4 weeks of a 42 day cycle was 1.04 mg/m2/dose, with  DLTs of 
thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise (Orlowski et al., 2002).  The 
toxicity was greatest during the third and fourth weeks of therapy. In the 3 -week schedule of 
bortezomib monotherapy (4 doses, given on Days 1, 4, 8, a nd 11 of a 21 -day treatment cycle), the 
DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m2/dose (3 subjects with Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 with peripheral sensory 
neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD at this schedule was 1.3 mg/m2/dose.  In a 35 -day treatment cycle 
with 4 weekly doses of VELCADE monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 mg/m2/dose and DLT included 
hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, and syncope.   
In phase 1 clinical studies, anti -tumor activity was reported in subjects with NHL, multiple myeloma, 
Waldenström’s Macroglobulinem ia, squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, bronchoalveolar 
carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer.  
The safety and efficacy of bortezomib in subjects with multiple myeloma were investigated in two 
phase 2 clinical studies, stu dies M34100 -024 (subjects with first relapse) and M34100 -025 (subjects 
with second or greater relapse and refractory to their last prior therapy).  In M34100 -025, [ADDRESS_576300] 2 previous t reatments received 
bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21 -day treatment cycle. The European Group for 
Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_149617] (Blade et al., 1998) 
were utilized to determine disease respons e.  CRs were observed in 4% of subjects, with an 
additional 6% of participants meeting all criteria for CR but having a positive immunofixation test.  PR 
or better was observed in 27% of subjects, and the overall response rate (CR, PR and minor 
response [M R] combined) was 35%.  Seventy percent of subjects experienced stable disease or 
better.   
The phase 3 study (M34101 -039), also referred to as the APEX study, was designed to determine 
whether bortezomib provided benefit (time to progression [TTP], respons e rate, and survival) to 
participants with relapsed or refractory MM relative to treatment with high -dose dexamethasone.  The 
study was also designed to determine the safety and tolerability of bortezomib relative to high -dose 
dexamethasone, and whether tr eatment with bortezomib was associated with superior clinical benefit 
and quality of life relative to high -dose dexamethasone. A total of 669 participants were enrolled and 
663 participants received study drug (VELCADE: 331; dexamethasone: 332).  Participa nts 
randomized to bortezomib received 1.3 mg/m2 I.V. push twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3 -
week cycle for up to eight treatment cycles as induction therapy, followed by 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib 
weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 5 -week cycle for t hree cycles as maintenance therapy. 
Participants randomized to dexamethasone received oral dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on days 
1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 5 -week cycle for up to four treatment cycles as induction therapy, 
followed by [CONTACT_452115] e 40 mg once daily on days 1 to 4 followed of a 4 -week cycle for five 
cycles as maintenance therapy. The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) 
Page 15 of 74 
 response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_149617] (Blade et al., 1998) were utilized to determine disease 
response.  There was a 78% increase in TTP for the bortezomib arm. Median TTP was 6.2 months 
for the bortezomib arm and 3.5 months for the dexamethasone arm ( P<.0001). CR (complete 
response) + PR (partial response) was 38% with VELCADE vs. 18% with dexamet hasone ( P.0001). 
CR was 6% with VELCADE vs. 1% with dexamethasone ( P<.0001). The CR + nCR rate was13% 
with bortezomib vs. 2% with dexamethasone. In participants who had received only one prior line of 
treatment (VELCADE: 132; dexamethasone: 119), CR + PR  was 45% with bortezomib vs. 26% with 
dexamethasone ( P=.0035). With a median 8.3 months of follow -up, overall survival was significantly 
longer ( P=.0013) for participants on the VELCADE arm vs. participants on the dexamethasone arm. 
The probability of surv ival at one year was 80% for the bortezomib arm vs. 66% for the 
dexamethasone arm, which represented a 41% decreased relative risk of death in the first year with 
bortezomib ( P=.0005). In participants who had received only one prior line of treatment, the 
probability of survival at one year was 89% for the bortezomib arm vs. 72% for the dexamethasone 
arm, which represented a 61% decreased relative risk of death in the first year with VELCADE 
(P=.0098). (Richardson et al., 2005)  
Studies using bortezomib as m onotherapy and in combination with other chemot herapy agents are 
continuing.   
Potential Risks of Bortezomib  
Most common side effects of bortezomib (i.e., incidence 30%) observed in participants are 
weakness, fatigue, and general discomfort; gastrointesti nal (GI) effects such as constipation, 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and anorexia, which may result in dehydration and/or weight loss; fever; 
peripheral neuropathy (including painful sensations or numbness and tingling in hands and feet that 
may not get bette r after discontinuation of VELCADE); thrombocytopenia that may increase the risk of 
bleeding, and anemia.  
Very common side effects of bortezomib (i.e., incidence 10 –29%) observed in participants are 
neutropenia that may increase the risk of infection; abd ominal pain; dyspepsia; nasopharyngitis; 
arthralgias; myalgias; skin rash that can be erythematous, pruritic and display leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis at biopsy; rigors; hypotension; dizziness; fluid retention; pain in limbs and bones; 
paresthesia; dysesthes ia; dyspnea; cough; epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]; headache; blurred vision; changed sense of 
taste; insomnia; anxiety; herpes zoster, and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/lung infections including pneumonia.  
Common side effects of bortezomib (i.e., incidence 1 –9%) observed in participants are lymphopenia; 
pancytopenia; palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]; tachycardia; bradycardia; atrial fibrillation; angina pectoris; acute onset of 
congestive heart failure including pulmonary edema (participants with risk factors for, or existing, 
heart disease should be closely  monitored); pleural effusion; tinnitus; conjunctivitis; ; abdominal 
distension; oral and esophageal mucositis; oral candidiasis; upper and lower GI bleeding; bronchitis; 
sinusitis; urinary tract infection; gastroenteritis; sepsis; hyponatremia; hyperglyce mia; hypoglycemia 
(Participants on oral antidiabetic agents may require close monitoring of their blood sugar levels.); 
dehydration; orthostatic hypotension; syncope; convulsions; renal failure; hematuria; depression; 
confusion; increases in serum AST, ALT , GGT and alkaline phosphatase.                                              
Page 16 of 74 
 Uncommon side effects of bortezomib (i.e., incidence <1%) observed in participants are febrile 
neutropenia; atrial flutter; bradycardia; new onset of decreased left ventricular ej ection fraction; 
cardiogenic shock; hearing impairment; ileus paralytic/small bowel obstruction; upper gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage; oral mucosal petechiae; liver injury including abnormal liver function tests, 
hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and liver failu re (reported in participants receiving multiple concomitant 
medications and with serious underlying medical conditions); drug hypersensitivity; injection site 
reaction; aspergillosis; pulmonary embolism; hemoptysis; cerebral hemorrhage; and tumor lysis 
syndrome.  Isolated cases of QT -interval prolongation have been reported, but are not thought to be 
related to bortezomib treatment.  Complications arising from these bortezomib toxicities may result in 
death.  
The effect of bortezomib on reproduction and its safety in pregnancy are unknown. Laboratory tests 
show that bortezomib may damage DNA therefore it is possible that bortezomib may cause infertility 
in men and women.  
3.2 Thalidomide  (Thalomid)  
Description  
Thalidomide is an N -phthaloyl -glutamic acid imide.  Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] -(N- phthalimido) 
glutarimide.  The empi[INVESTIGATOR_24598] C 13H10N2O4 and the gram molecular weight is 258.2.  The CAS 
number of thalidomide is 50 -35-1.  Thalidomide is an off -white to white, nearly odorless, crystalline 
powder that is soluble at 25 C in dimethyl sulfate (50 mg/ml) and ethanol (1 mg/ml).  The glutarimide 
part of the molecule contains a single asymmetric center and, therefore, may exist in either of two 
optically active forms designated S( -) or R(+).  Thalidomide is an equal mixture of the S( -) and R(+) 
forms and therefore has a net optical rotation of zero.  The enantiomers, both the S( -) and R(+) forms 
differ from the racemic thalidomide in having higher solubility in water (Hague and Smith, 1988, 
Williams 1968, Williams et al. 1965) and undergoing faster hydrolytic cleavage (Hague and Smith, 
1988).  
Contrain dications and Precautions  
Thalidomide causes severe birth defects.  It must not be taken during pregnancy or within one month 
of having sexual intercourse that could result in pregnancy.  Females of childbearing potential should 
be instructed that they mus t not be pregnant when thalidomide therapy is initiated.  A blood test or 
professionally conducted urine test to rule out pregnancy prior to initiating thalidomide therapy is 
required.  While taking thalidomide, all female participants of childbearing pote ntial must use two 
methods of birth control, one barrier and one hormonal or should abstain from sexual intercourse that 
could result in pregnancy.  It is not known if thalidomide is present in semen; therefore, it is 
recommended that male participants use  barrier contraception while on thalidomide.  Both males and 
females of childbearing potential should continue with the contraceptive measures described above 
for one month after dosing has been discontinued.  
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_576301] been reports of 
changes of the heart rate and rhythm.  Allergic reactions include low blood pressure, rash, fever and 
rapid heartbeat associated with thalidomide use.  
Serious dermatologic (skin) reactions including a disease called Stevens -Johnson syndrome (which 
could be fatal) hav e been reported with thalidomide.  Symptoms of Stevens -Johnson Syndrome 
include flu -like symptoms (fever, achiness), and a crusty rash may form on mouth, lips, nose and 
genitals.  The eyes may also become red and itchy and the disease may eventually result  in 
blindness. The disease can also affect the lungs, stomach and bowel, kidneys and heart if not 
treated.  If any of the above -mentioned symptoms or a skin rash of any type develop, thalidomide 
should be discontinued until thorough evaluation of the rash can be evaluated.   
Seizures, including generalized tonic -clonic convulsions, have been reported after thalidomide was 
approved by [CONTACT_452116], but it has not been determined that thalidomide caused 
these seizures. During therapy with thal idomide, participants with a history of seizures or with other 
risk factors for the development of seizures should be closely monitored for changes that could cause 
acute seizure activity.  
DRUG INTERACTIONS  
Drug -drug interactions do not appear to have been  systematically studied but it has been reported 
that thalidomide enhances the sedative effects of barbiturates, alcohol, chlorpromazine, and 
reserpi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Its sedative action is antagonized by [CONTACT_452117] (Somers 
1960).  
Females who  require treatment with rifampin, rifabutin, barbiturates, glucocorticoids, phenytoin, or 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_452057].  
PHARMACOLOGY  
Thalidomide is  available as [ADDRESS_576302] gelatin capsules.  
Stability and Storage:  The drug product has been shown to be stable for at least one year when 
stored under ambient conditions.  Over this time period, the capsules show no significant loss in 
potency a nd no significant increase in degradation products.  Furthermore, the drug product has been 
shown to be stable when stored under conditions of stress (40 C/75% relative humidity, 6 months).  
Page [ADDRESS_576303].  
Label Information:  The immediate container dispensed to the participant must contain the following 
warnings:  
WARNING :  This drug causes severe b irth defects.  It must not be taken during pregnancy or within 
one month of having sexual intercourse that could result in pregnancy.  
CAUTION :  This drug must only be used by [CONTACT_452118].  Do not share this 
drug.  
3.3 Dexamethasone  (Decadron)  
DESCRIPTION  
Dexamethasone is a synthetic adrenocortical steroid and is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract.  Chemically, dexamethasone is 9 -fluoro -11ß, 17, 21 -thrihydroxy -16α-methyl -pregna -1, 4-diene -
3, 20-dione.  
TOXICOLOGY  
Human Toxicology: Possible adverse effects associated with the use of dexamethasone are: fluid and 
electrolyte disturbances, congestive heart failure in susceptible persons, hypertension, euphoria, 
personality changes, insomnia, exacer bation of infection (e.g., tuberculosis), exacerbation or 
symptoms of diabetes, psychosis, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, 
pancreatitis, esophagitis, peptic ulcer, dermatologic disturbances, convulsions, vertigo and headache , 
endocrine abnormalities, ophthalmic changes, and metabolic changes.  Some participants have 
experienced itching and other allergic, anaphylactic or other hypersensitivity reactions.  Withdrawal 
from prolonged therapy may result in symptoms including feve r, myalgia and arthralgia. Phenytoin, 
phenobarbital and ephedrine enhance metabolic clearance of corticosteroids.  
Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in participants with hypothyroidism, cirrhosis, ocular herpes 
simplex, existing emotional instabilit y or psychotic tendencies, nonspecific ulcerative colitis, 
diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, 
osteoporosis and myasthenia gravis.  Immunization procedures (especially smallpox vaccination) 
should not be undertaken in participants on corticosteroids.  
PHARMACOLOGY  
Kinetics:  Natural and synthetic glucocorticoids are readily and completely absorbed from the GI tract.  
Dexamethasone is insoluble in water.  Glucocorticoids have salt -retaining properties , although 
dexamethasone nearly completely lacks this property.  The anti -inflammatory property of this drug is 
its ability to modify the body’s immune system.  On the other hand, glucocorticoids suppress the 
body’s response to viral and bacterial infectio ns. 
Page 19 of 74 
 Formulation:  Dexamethasone is available in six potencies (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1.5 mg, 4 mg, 
and 6 mg) in capsule or tablet form.  
Storage and Stability: Dexamethasone is to be stored at room temperature.  
Administration:  T he drug is administered orally.  
3.4 Melphalan  (Alkeran)  
DESCRIPTION  
Chemistry:  Melphalan (L -phenylamine mustard, L -PAM, L -Sarcolysin) is an alkylating agent coupled 
to an amino acid.  
Molecular Formula:  C 13H18C12N2O2   M.W.:  305  
TOXICOLOGY  
Human Toxicology:  Melphalan’s major systemic toxicity is bone marrow depression with secondary 
anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, usually occurring within three to five weeks of the onset of 
therapy and lasting four to eight weeks.  Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy exacerbates these 
effects.  Other side -effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, esophagitis, colitis, 
increases in liver function and kidney function tests, renal/bladder necrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], perip heral neuropathy, paresthesia, alopecia, fever, and hypersensitivity 
including edema, rash and anaphylaxis.  The occurrence of acute leukemia has been rarely reported 
in participants treated with anthracycline/alkylator combination chemotherapy.  
PHARMACOLO GY 
Formulation:  The intravenous preparation is available in a sterile, [ADDRESS_576304].   
Solution  preparation: Vial/50 mg: Constitute with 10 ml of the special diluent to yield a 5 mg/ml 
melphalan concentration.  Prior to administration, dilute the constituted solution with 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP, to a concentration no greater than 2 mg/m l.   
Storage and Stability: The intact packages of melphalan for intravenous administration should be 
stored at room temperature (15 -30C) protected from light.  Shelf surveillance of the intact dosage 
form is ongoing.  
Constitution with the special diluent  as directed results in a solution that retains at least 90% 
melphalan potency for about 3 hours at 30 C.  Storage at 5 C results in precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332].  
When the constituted solution is diluted to concentrations of 0.45 or 0.1 mg/ml in 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Inje ction USP, 90% melphalan potency is retained for 45 minutes at 30 C.  At 20 C, the 0.1 
mg/ml concentration retained 90% potency for 3 hours.  The manufacturer recommends 
administration of melphalan within one hour of constitution.  
Page 20 of 74 
 In dilute solutions of ap proximately 40 g/ml, increasing amounts of chloride ion appear to enhance 
stability.  For example, increasing the chloride content of such a solution from 0.2% to 0.9% increases 
the half -life from 8 to 16 hours.  
Increased temperature as well as decreased chloride ion is associated with much higher degradation 
rates.  An increase of temperature from 20 C to 25C decreased the time to 10% decomposition by 
[CONTACT_452119] -half in each case.  
Administration : melphalan will be administered intravenously . 
3.5  Cisplatin  (Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum [CDDP], Platinol)  
DESCRIPTION  
Cisplatin is a heavy metal complex and is water -soluble.  It is a white lyophilized powder with a 
molecular weight of 300.1.  Mechanism of action:  It acts as a bifunctional alkylating agent.  
TOXICOLOGY  
Human Toxicology: Human toxicity includes anorexia, nausea, vomiting, renal toxicity (with an 
elevation of BUN, creatinine, serum uric acid and impairment of endogenous creatinine clearance, as 
well as renal tubula r damage), ototoxicity (with hearing loss which is initially in the high frequency 
range, as well as tinnitus), and hyperuricemia.  Much more severe and prolonged toxicity has been 
observed in participants with abnormal or obstructed urinary excretory trac ts.  Raynaud’s phenomena 
and digital ischemia has been described.  Anaphylactic -like reactions including facial edema, 
bronchoconstriction, tachycardia and hypotension may occur within minutes of administration.  
Myelosuppression, often delayed erythrosupp ression, is expected.  In the high -dose treatment 
regimen with osmotic diuresis, the nadir of white cells and platelets occurred regularly at about two 
weeks with recovery generally at about three weeks after the initiation of therapy.  Rare complications 
are alopecia, seizures, loss of taste, allergic reactions, and loss of muscle or nerve function.  Tetany 
may occur due to hypomagnesemia and/or hypercalcemia.  Other electrolyte disturbances may occur.  
At high doses, participants have experienced optic ne uritis, papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], cerebral blindness, blurred 
vision, and altered color perception.  Participants have also experienced cardiac abnormalities, 
elevated SGOT and rash.  Subsequent courses should not be given until serum creatinine returns to 
normal, if e levated.  Audiometric analyses should be monitored and courses withheld until auditory 
acuity is within normal limits.  The occurrence of acute leukemia has been reported rarely in 
participants treated with anthracycline/alkyla tor combination chemotherapy.   
PHARMACOLOGY  
Kinetics:  After a single IV dose, increased concentration is found in the liver, kidneys, and small and 
large intestines.  Plasma levels of cisplatin decay in a biphasic mode with an initial half -life of 25 to 49 
minutes, and a secondary ph ase ranging from 58 to 73 hours.  This prolonged phase is due to protein 
binding, which exceeds 90% of the radioactivity, excreted in the first five days.  The initial fractions of 
radioactivity are largely unchanged drugs.  Although this drug seems to act  as an alkylating agent, 
there are data to indicate that its mode and sites of action are different from those of nitrogen mustard 
and the standard alkylating agents.  Cisplatin penetrates poorly into CNS.  
Page 21 of 74 
 Formulation:  Cisplatin is available in 50 mg and 100 mg reconstituted vials.  
Storage and Stability:  The intact vials may be stored at room temperature (15 -25C) for the lot life 
indicated on the package.  Do not refrigerate.  The solution may be further diluted in a chloride -
containing vehicle such as D 5NS, NS, or D5½NS (precipi[INVESTIGATOR_25469] D5W).  
Administration:  Cisplatin should be given as a slow intravenous infusion. Needles or intravenous sets 
containing aluminum parts that may come in contact [CONTACT_452120] (Platinol) should not be used for 
preparation or administration, as a black precipi[INVESTIGATOR_25470] 30 minutes.  
3.6 Doxorubicin  (Adriamycin)  
DESCRIPTION  
Mechanism of action: Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic different from daunorubicin by 
[CONTACT_46917] a hydroxyl group in the C -14 position.  Doxorubicin is produced by [CONTACT_60781] 
S. peucetius var. caesius.  Its mechanism of action is thought to be the binding of nucleic acids, 
preventing DNA and possibly RNA synthesis.  
TOXICOLOGY  
Human Toxicology: Studies with doxorubicin have shown that the major toxic effects of this drug are 
alopecia, which is often total but always revers ible; nausea and vomiting, which develops shortly after 
drug administration, occasionally persisting for 2 -3 days; fever on the day of administration; and 
phlebitis at the site of the drug’s injection.  Extravasation of the drug will lead to soft tissue ne crosis.  
Phleboscleriosis, cellulitis, vesication and erythematous streaking have also been seen.  Mucositis 
may be seen [ADDRESS_576305] also been observed.  Hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_452058], onycholysis and recall of skin reaction from prior radiotherapy may occur.  Cardiac 
toxicity ma nifested as acute left ventricular failure, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia or severe 
cardiomyopathy has been reported, but appears to occur predominantly in participants who receive 
total doses in excess of 550 mg/m2.   
Myelosuppression, predominantl y neutropenia, is common with nadir occurring approximately two 
weeks after a single injection; lesser degrees of anemia and thrombocytopenia have been reported.  
Rapid recovery of blood counts approximately two and a half weeks after a single injection ge nerally 
permits an every three -week dosing schedule.   
Participants with obstructive liver disease have more severe myelosuppression due to impaired drug 
excretion.  Thus, participants with hepatic dysfunction may need to have reduced dosage or be 
excluded  from therapy.  Renal excretion of doxorubicin is minimal, but enough to color the urine red; 
thus impaired renal function does no appear to increase the toxicity of doxorubicin.  Other side effects 
include fever, chills, facial flushing, itching, anaphyla xis, conjunctivitis and lacrimation.  The 
occurrence of acute leukemia has been reported rarely in participants treated with 
anthracycline/alkylator combination chemotherapy.  
Page [ADDRESS_576306] not been 
adequately evaluated.  Safety in nursing women has not been proven.  
PHARMACOLOGY  
Kinetics:  Intravenous administration is followed by a rapid plasma clearance with significant tissue 
binding.  Urinary excretion is negligible; biliary excretion accounts for 40 to 50% of the administered 
dose being recovered in the bile or the feces in 7 days.  The drug does not cross the blood -brain 
barrier . 
Formulation:  Doxorubicin is supplied in 10, 20, and 50 mg single use vials, and 150 and 200 mg 
multidose vials.  
Storage and Stability: Doxorubicin is stable for 24 hours at room temperature and 15 days under 
refrigeration (2 -8C).  It should be protect ed from exposure to sunlight.  Discard any unused solution 
from the vials.  Bacteriostatic diluents with preservatives are NOT recommended as they might 
possibly worsen the reaction to extravasated drug.  
Administration:  Doxorubicin may be further diluted in 5% dextrose or sodium chloride injection and 
should be administered slowly into tubing of a freely flowing intravenous infusion with great care 
taken to avoid extravasation.  
3.7 Cyclophosphamide  (Cytoxan)  
DESCRIPTION  
2[bis (2 chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro -2H-1,3,2 -oxazophosphorine 2 -oxide mono -hydrate.  
Cyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating meta bolites that cross -
link to DNA.  
TOXICOLOGY  
Human Toxicology : Toxicity from cyclophosphamide i ncludes bone marrow suppression which 
usually occurs 10 to 12 days after administration; nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, 
diarrhea and stomatitis; reversible alopecia; hemorrhagic cystitis, which can frequently be prevented 
with increased hydration; fibrosis of the bladder; cardiac toxicity, which may potentiate doxorubicin -
induced cardiotoxicity; rare anaphylactic reaction, skin rash, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], interstitial pulmonary 
fibrosis, and cross sensitivity with other alkylating agents.  T reatment with cyclophosphamide may 
cause significant suppression of the immune system.  
Secondary malignancies, most frequently of the urinary bladder and hematologic systems, have been 
reported when Cytoxan® is used alone or with other anti -neoplastic drug s.  Malignancies may occur 
several years after treatment has been discontinued.  Cyclophosphamide interferes with oogenesis 
and spermatogenesis and may cause sterility in both sexes, which is dose and duration related.  
Cyclophosphamide has been found to b e teratogenic, and women of childbearing potential should be 
advised to avoid becoming pregnant.  Increased myelosuppression may be seen with chronic 
Page [ADDRESS_576307] milk, 
and it is advised that mothers discontinue nursing during cyclophosphamide administration.  The 
occurrence of acute leukemia has been reported rarely in participants treated with 
anthracycline/alkylator combination che motherapy.  
PHARMACOLOGY  
Kinetics:  Cyclophosphamide is activated principally in the liver by a mixed function microsomal 
oxidase system.  PO administration is well absorbed, with bioavailability greater than 75%.  5 -25% of 
unchanged drug is excreted in the  urine.  Several active and inactive metabolites have been identified 
with variable plasma protein binding.  There appears to be no evidence of clinical toxicity in 
participants with renal failure, although elevated levels of metabolites have been observed .

3.8 Etoposide  (VP-16), (Vepesid) (Ethylidene -Lignan P)   
DESCRIPTION  
Chemistry:  Etoposide is a semi -synthetic podophyllotoxin derivative from the plant podophyllum 
pletatum, and has antineoplastic properties in experimental animals and in humans.  The empi[INVESTIGATOR_452059] C 29H32O has a molecular weight of 588.  
Mechanism of Acti on:  The epi[INVESTIGATOR_452060], but in contrast to the vinca -alkaloids, have an additional activity of inhibiting cells 
from entering mitosis.  Suppression of tritiated thymidine, uridine, an d leucine incorporation in human 
cells in tissue culture suggests effects against DNA, RNA and protein synthesis.   
Animal Tumor Data:  Significant antitumor effect has been demonstrated in L1210, mouse sarcoma 
[ADDRESS_576308] intracerebrally inoculated L1210.  
 
Page 24 of 74 
 TOXICOLOGY  
Animal Toxicology: The predom inant toxicities of etoposide in animal studies involve the 
hematopoietic system, with toxicity to the liver and GI tract occurring only at doses producing 
profound myelosuppression.  Anemia, leukopenia, and lymphoid involution occur in mice, rats and 
monk eys.  Acute toxicity investigations have been complicated by [CONTACT_100304].  
The LD -50 of the solvent plus drug approached that of the solvent alone.  Immunosuppressive effects 
occur with an inhibition of antibody production in mice an d monkeys, and prevention of experimental 
allergic encephalomyelitis in rats (cell -mediated immunity).  
Human Toxicology: Reversible myelotoxicity has been uniformly observed to be the major toxicity of 
etoposide and to represent the only clinically signifi cant side effect.  Following a single IV injection, 
peak myelotoxicity occurs at seven to nine days.  Following daily IV injections for five to seven days, 
myelotoxicity is maximal between [ADDRESS_576309] a 30 -minute period.  
Occasionally, chills, fever, peripheral neurotoxicity, stomatitis, hepatotoxicity, transient cortical 
blindness and radiation recall dermatitis may be a result of etoposide administration .  The occurrence 
of acute leukemia has been rarely reported in participants treated with etoposide in association with 
other antineoplastic agents.  
Pregnancy and Lactation: Etoposide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  
Etoposide has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rats.  In these studies, etoposide caused 
dose -related maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity.  Fetal abnormalities included 
decreased weight, major skeletal abnormalities, exencephaly, encephaloc ele, anophthalmia, and 
retarded ossification.  No information is available on excretion of this drug in human milk.  Because 
many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in 
nursing infants, it is recommen ded that nursing be discontinued.  
PHARMACOLOGY  
Kinetics:  After IV administration, disposition is biphasic with initial half -life of 1.5 hours and terminal 
half-life of 4 - 11 hours.  Drug does not accumulate in plasma following daily administration of 100  
mg/M2 for 4 - 5 days.  Drug poorly crosses blood -brain barrier.  Recovery after IV administration of 
radiolabeled etoposide in the urine ranges from 42 - 67% and feces from 0 - 16%.  The mutagenic 
and genotoxic potential has been established in mammalian cells.  
Formulation:  100 mg of etoposide is supplied as 5 ml of solution in Sterile Multiple Dose Vials for 
injection.  The pH of the yellow clear solution is 3 - 4.  Each ml contains 20 mg etoposide, 2 mg citric 
acid, 30 mg benzyl alcohol, 80 mg polysorba te 80/tween 80, 650 mg polyethylene glycol 300, and 
30.5% (v/v) alcohol.  Etoposide must be diluted prior to use with either 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, 
or 0.9% sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  The time before precipi[INVESTIGATOR_452061] 25 of 74 
 concentration;  however, when at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml it is stable for 96 hours at room 
temperature and at 0.4 mg/ml it is stable for 48 hours.  
Storage and Stability: The drug is available as a box of [ADDRESS_576310] it from light.  Etoposide is less stable in 5% Dextrose 
injection and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_452062].  
Administration:  Etoposide is administered by [CONTACT_452121].  
3.9 Lenalidomide  (Revlimid)  
WARNING: FETAL RISK, HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY, and DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS AND 
PULMONARY EMBOLISM  
FETAL RISK  
Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb abnormalities in a  developmental monkey study 
similar to birth defects caused by [CONTACT_452122]. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, it 
may cause birth defects or death to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_106784].  
Pregnancy must be excluded before start of treatment. Prevent pregnancy  during treatment by [CONTACT_452123].  
HEMATOLOGICAL  TOXICITY  
Can cause significant ne utropenia and thrombocytopenia.  
DVT AND PE  
Significantly increased risk of DVT and PE in participants with multiple myeloma receiving 
lenalidomide with dexamethasone. Participants and physicians are advised to be observant  for the 
signs and symptoms of thrombo -embolism. Participants should be instructed to seek medical care if 
they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. It is not 
known whether prophylactic anticoagulation or antipl atelet therapy prescribed in conjunction with 
lenalidomide may lessen the potential for venous thromboembolic events. The decision to take 
prophylactic measures should be done carefully after an assessment of an individual participant’s 
underlying risk.  
INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE  
Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analogue indicated for the treatment of  multiple myeloma (MM), in 
combination with dexamethasone, in participants who have received at least one prior therapy.  
DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
MM: [ADDRESS_576311] 4 
cycles of therapy and then 40 mg/day orally on Days 1 -4 every 28 days.  Treatment is con tinued or 
modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings.  
Page 26 of 74 
 DOSE ADJUSTMENTS FOR HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITIES DURING MULTIPLE MYELOMA 
TREATMENT  
Dose modification guidelines are recommended to manage Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia or other Grade  3 or 4 toxicity judged to be related to lenalidomide.  
DOSE ADJUSTMENTS FOR RENAL IMPAIRMENT IN MM  
Since lenalidomide  is primarily excreted unchanged by [CONTACT_10521], adjustments to the starting dose of  
lenalidomide  are recommended to provide appropriate drug exposure in participants with moderate or 
severe renal impairment and in participants on dialysis.  Based on a pharmacokinetic study in 
participants with renal impairment due to non -malignant conditions, LENALID OMIDE  starting dose 
adjustment is recommended for participants with CLcr <60 mL/min. Non -dialysis participants with 
creatinine clearances less than 11 mL/min and dialysis participants with creatinine clearances less 
than 7 mL/min have not been studied.  A fter initiation of LENALIDOMIDE  therapy, subsequent 
LENALIDOMIDE  dose modification should be based on individual participant treatment tolerance.   
DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  
Lenalidomide [ADDRESS_576312] was seen at all doses  tested. Due to the results of this developmental monkey study, and 
lenalidomide’s structural similarities to thalidomide, a known human teratogen, lenalidomide is 
contraindicated in pregnant women and women capable of becoming pregnant . Females of 
childbe aring potential may be treated with lenalidomide provided adequate precautions are taken to 
avoid pregnancy. Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual 
intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, including at least one highly effective 
method (e.g., hormonal contraception, tubal ligation, IUD or partner’s vasectomy) and one additional 
effective method (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), beginning [ADDRESS_576313] pregnancy testing 
(sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL). Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a 
participant misses her period or if there is any abnormality in menstrual bl eeding. If pregnancy occurs, 
lenalidomide must be immediately discontinued. Under these conditions, the participant should be 
referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and 
counseling.  
Lenalidomide is also contraindicated in participants who have demonstrated hypersensitivity  
(e.g., angioedema, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]) to  lenalidomide.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_576314] 4 weeks after completing therapy. There are no adequate and 
well-controll ed studies in pregnant females.  
Hematologic Toxicity  
Lenalidomide  can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  In the pooled multiple 
myeloma studies Grade 3 an d 4 hematologic toxicities were more frequent in participants treated with 
the co mbination of lenalidomide and dexa methasone than in participants treated with dexamethasone 
alone.  
Deep Vein Th rombosis and Pulmonary Embolism  
Venous thromboembolic events (predominantly deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) 
have occurred in participants with multiple myel oma treated with lenalidomide combination therapy or 
treated with lenalidomide monotherapy. A significant ly increased risk of DVT and PE was observed in 
participants with multiple myeloma who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy 
in a cl inical trial . It is not known whether prophylactic anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy 
prescribed in conjunction with lenalidomide  may lessen the potential for venous thromboembolic 
events . The decision to take prophylactic measures should be done care fully after an assessment of 
an individual partici pant’s underlying risk factors.  
Allergic Reactions  
Angioedema and serious dermatologic reactions including Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) and 
toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN) have been reported. These events can be fatal. Participants with a 
prior history of Grade [ADDRESS_576315] one dose of 
lenalidomide /dexamethasone (353 participants) or placebo/dexamethasone (350 participants).  In the 
lenalidomide /dexamethasone treatment group, 269 participants (76%) underwent at least one dose 
interruption with or without a dose reduction of lenalidomide  compared to 199 participants (57%) in 
the placebo/dexamethasone treatment group. Of these participants who had one dose interruption 
with or without a dose reduction, 50% in the lenalidomide /dexamethasone treatment group underwent 
at least one additional dose interrup tion with or without a dose reduction compared to 21% in the 
placebo/dexamethasone treatment group. Most adverse events and Grade 3/4 adverse events were 
more frequent in participants who received the combination of lenalidomide /dexamethasone 
compared to p lacebo/dexamethasone.  
Median duration of exposure among participants treated with lenalidomide /dexamethasone was 44 
weeks while median duration of exposure among participants treated with placebo/dexamethasone 
was 23 weeks. This should be taken into consid eration when comparing frequency of adverse events 
between two treatment groups lenalidomide /dexametha sone vs. placebo/dexamethasone.  
Deep Vein Th rombosis and Pulmonary Embolism  
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was reported as a serious adverse drug reaction (7.4%) or Grade 3/4 
(8.2%) at a higher rate in the lenalidomide /dexamethasone group compared to 3.1% and 3.4% in the 
placebo/dexamethasone group, respectively. Discontinuations due to DVT adverse reactions were 
reported at c omparable rates between groups.  
Pulmonary embolism (PE) was reported as a serious adverse drug reaction including Grade 3/4 
(3.7%) at a higher rate in the lenalidomide /dexamethasone group compared to 0.9% in the 
placebo/dexamethasone group. Discontinuations due to PE adverse reactions were reported at 
comparable rates betw een groups.  
Other Adverse Events  
In these clinical studies of lenalidomide  in participants with multiple myeloma, the following adverse 
drug reac tions (ADRs) not described above that occurred at ≥1% rate and of at least twice of the 
placebo  percentage rate were reported:  
Blood and lymphatic system disorders:  pancytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia  
Cardiac disorders:  bradycardia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris  
Page 29 of 74 
 Endocrine disorders: hirsutism  
Eye disorders: blindness, ocular hypertension  
Gastrointestinal disorders: gastrointestinal hemorrhage, glossodynia  
General disorders and administration site conditions: malaise  
Investiga tions: liver function tests abnormal, alanine aminotransferase increased,  
Nervous system disorders: cerebral ischemia  
Psychiatric disorders: mood swings, hallucination loss of libido  
Reproductive system and breast disorders: erectile dysfunction,  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_92601], thoracic and mediastinal disorders: cough, hoarseness  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: exanthem, skin hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_452063] d nonclinical studies show that lenalidomide  is 
neither metabolized by [CONTACT_452124] P450 pathway suggesting that 
lenalidomide is not likely to cause or be subject to P450 -based meta bolic drug interactions in man.  
DIGOXIN  
When digoxin was co -administered with lenalidomide, t he digoxin AUC was not significantly different; 
however, the digoxin Cmax was increased by 14%. Periodic monitoring of digoxin plasma levels, in 
accordance with clinical judgment and based on standard clinical practice in participants receiving 
this medica tion, is recommended during administration of lenalidomide.  
WARFARIN  
Co-administration of multiple doses of [ADDRESS_576316] 
on the pharmaco kinetics of total lenalidomide. Expected changes in laboratory assessments of  PT 
and INR were observed after warfarin administration, but these changes w ere not affected by 
[CONTACT_239960].  
Concomitant Therapi [INVESTIGATOR_452064], or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as estrogen 
containing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], should be used with caution in multiple myeloma participants receiving 
lenalidomide with dex amethasone.  
 
 
Page 30 of 74 
 GERIATRIC USE  
Lenalidomide has been used in multiple myeloma (MM) clinical trials in participants up to 86 years of 
age. Of the 703 MM participants who received study treatment in Studies 1 and 2, 45% were age 65 
or over while 12% of participants were age 75 and over. The percentage  of participants age 65 or 
over was not significantly different between the lenalidomide / dexamethasone and 
placebo/dexamethasone groups. Of the 353 participants who received lenalidomide /dexamethasone, 
46% were age 65 and over. In both studies, participan ts >65 years of age were more likely than 
participants ≤65 years of age to experience DVT, pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, and renal 
failure following use of lenalidomide . No differences in efficacy were observed between participants 
over 65 years  of age and younger participants.  
DESCRIPTION  
Lenalidomide , a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with antiangiogenic and 
antineoplastic properties. The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3 -dihydro -2H -isoindol -2-yl) 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -2,6-dione and it has the following chemical structure: 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3-dihydro -2H -
isoindol -2-yl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -2,6-dione The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C13H13N3O3, and the 
gram molecular weight is 259.3.  Lenalidomide  is available in [ADDRESS_576317] demonstrated 
that lenalidomide inhibits the growth of cells derived from participants with multiple myeloma and del 
(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes in vitro.  Lenalidomide causes a delay in tumor growth in some in 
vivo nonclinical hematopoietic tumor models, including multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide i nhibits the 
secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -α), from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells. Lenalidomide also inhibited the expression of cycoloxygenase -2 (COX -2) 
but not COX -[ADDRESS_576318] -dose. Co -administration with food 
does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does reduce t he maximal plasma concentration 
(Cmax) by 36%. The pharmaco -kinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increase 
proportionately with increases in dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose -regimen does not 
result in drug accumulation.  
Pharmacokinetic sampling in myelodysplastic syndromes participants was not performed. In multiple 
myeloma participants maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.[ADDRESS_576319] -
dose both on Days 1 and 28. AUC and Cmax values increase proportion ally with dose following 
Page 31 of 74 
 single and multiple doses. Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma participants is 57% higher t han in 
healthy male volunteers.  
Distribution  
In vitro (14C) -lenalidomide binding to plasma  proteins is approximately 30%.  
Metabolism  and Excr etion  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans h as not been studied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two -thirds of lenal idomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion. The 
process exceeds the glomerular filtration  rate and therefore is partially or entirely active. Half -life of 
elimination is approximately 3 hours.  
SPECIAL POPULATIONS  
Participants with Renal Impairment  
In multiple myeloma participants, those participants with mild renal impairment had an AUC 56% 
greater than th ose wi th normal renal function. Adjustment of the starting dose of lenalidomide   is 
recommended in participants with moderate or severe (CLcr <60 mL/min) renal impairment a nd in 
participants on dialysis.  
3.10 Carfilzomib (Kyprolis)   
For Injection, for intravenous use .  Initial U.S. Approval: [ADDRESS_576320] period.   Recommended Cycle 1 dose is 20 mg/m2/day, and if tolerated, 
increase Cycle 2 dose and subsequent cycles doses to 27 mg/m2/day.   Carfilzomib may also be 
given 56 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 , if deemed beneficial for patient by [CONTACT_1963] . 
 
The saf ety of carfilzomib was evaluated in clinical studies of 526 patients with relapsed and/or 
refractory multiple myeloma.  
 
Cardiac Arrest, Congestive Heart Failure, Myocardial Ischemia  
 
Death due to cardiac arrest has occurred within a day of carfilzomib  administration. New onset or 
worsening of pre -existing congestive heart failure with decreased left ventricular function or 
myocardial ischemia have occurred following administration of carfilzomib . Cardiac failure events 
(e.g., cardiac failure congestive , pulmonary edema, ejection fraction decreased) were reported in 7% 
of patients. Monitor for cardiac complications and manage promptly. Withhold carfilzomib  for Grade 3 
or 4 cardiac events until recovery and consider whether to restart carfilzomib  based on  a benefit/risk 
assessment. Patients with [LOCATION_001] Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure, myocardial 
infarction in the preceding 6 months, and conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by [CONTACT_452125] r isk for cardiac complications.   
 
 
Page 32 of 74 
  
Pulmonary Hypertension  
 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was reported in 2% of patients treated with carfilzomib and 
was Grade 3 or greater in less than 1% of patients. Evaluate with cardiac imaging and/or other tests 
as indicated. Withhold carfilzomib  for pulmonary hypertension until resolved or returned to baseline 
and consider whether to restart based on a benefit /risk assessment.  
 
Pulmonary Complications  
 
Dyspnea was reported in 35% of patients enrolled in clinical trials. Grade 3 dyspnea occurred in 5%; 
no Grade 4 events, and 1 death (Grade 5) was reported. Monitor and manage dyspnea immediately; 
interrupt carfilzomib  until symptoms have resolved or returned to baseline.  
 
Infusion Reactions  
 
Infusion reactions were characterized by a spectrum of systemic symptoms including fever, chills, 
arthralgia, myalgia, facial flushing, facial edema, vomiting, weakness, sho rtness of breath, 
hypotension, syncope, chest tightness, or angina. These reactions can occur immediately following 
infusion or up to [ADDRESS_576321] physician if symptoms of an infusion reaction occur.  
 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
 
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred following carfilzomib  administration in < 1% of patients. 
Patient s with multiple myeloma and a high tumor burden should be considered to be at greater risk 
for TLS. Prior to receiving carfilzomib , ensure that patients are well hydrated. Monitor for evidence of 
TLS during treatment, and manage promptly. Interrupt carfilz omib  until TLS is resolved.  
 
Thrombocytopenia  
 
Carfilzomib causes thrombocytopenia with platelet nadirs occurring around Day 8 of each 28 -day 
cycle and recovery to baseline by [CONTACT_452126] 28 -day cycle. In patients with multiple 
myeloma, 36% of p atients experienced thrombocytopenia, including Grade 4 in 10%. 
Thrombocytopenia following carfilzomib  administration resulted in a dose reduction in 1% of patients 
and discontinuation of treatment with cariflzomib  in < 1% of patients. Monitor platelet cou nts 
frequently during treatment with carfilzomib . Reduce or interrupt dose as clinically indicated.  
 
Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Failure  
 
Cases of hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported (< 1%). Carfilzomib  can cause 
elevations of serum transaminases and bilirubin. Withhold carfilzomib  in patients experiencing Grade 
3 or greater elevations of transaminases, bilirubin, or o ther liver enzyme abnormalities until resolved 
or returned to baseline. After resolution, consider if restarting carfilzomib  is appropriate. Monitor liver 
enzymes frequently.  
 
Embryo -fetal Toxicity  
 
Page 33 of 74 
 Carfilzomib  can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism 
of action and findings in animals. There are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant 
women using carfilzomib. Carfilzomib  caused embryo -fetal toxicity in pregnant rabbits at doses that 
were lower than in pa tients receiving the recommended dose. Females of reproductive potential 
should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with carfilzomib.  
 
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
 
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 45% of patients. The most common seri ous adverse 
reactions were pneumonia (10%), acute renal failure (4%), pyrexia (3%), and congestive heart failure 
(3%). Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of carfilzomib  occurred in 15% of patients and 
included congestive heart failure (2%), cardi ac arrest, dyspnea, increased blood creatinine, and acute 
renal failure (1% each).  
 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 30%) were fatigue (56%), anemia (47%), nausea 
(45%), thrombocytopenia (36%), dyspnea (35%), diarrhea (33%), and pyrexia (30%) . 
 
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
 
Since dialysis clearance of carfilzomib  concentrations has not been studied, the drug should be 
administered after the dialysis procedure.  
 
3.11 Pomalidomide  (Pomalyst)  
 
INDICATION  
 
Patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_452065] b ortez omib and have demonstrated disease progression on or within [ADDRESS_576322] not be exposed to pomalidomide.   
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
In the clinical trial of 219 patients who received pomalidomide alone (n=107) or pomalidomide + low -
dose dexamethasone (low -dose dex) (n=112), all patients had at least one treatment -emergent 
adverse reaction.  
In the pomalidomide alone versus pomalidomide  + low dose dexamethasone arms, respectively, most 
common adverse react ions (≥30%) included fatigue and asthenia (55%, 63%), neutropenia (52%, 
47%), anemia (38%, 39%), constipation (36%, 35%), nausea (36%, 22%), diarrhea (34%, 33%), 
dyspnea (34%, 45%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (32%, 25%), back pain (32%, 30%), and 
pyrexia (19%, 30%)  
90% o f patients treated with pomalidomide  alone and 88% o f patients treated with pomalidomide  + 
low-dose dex  had at least one treatment -emergent NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction .  
In the pomalidomide alone versus pomalidomide + low dose dexamethasone arms, respectively, most 
common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥15%) included neutropenia (47%, 38%), anemia (2 2%, 21%), 
thrombocytopenia (22%, 19%), and pneumonia (16%, 23%). For other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities besides 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, hold treatment and restart treatment at 1 mg less than the 
previous dose when toxicity has resolved to less than or  equal to Grade 2 at the physician’s 
discretion .  
67% o f patients treated with pomalidomide  and 62% o f patients treated with pomalidomide  + low -
dose dex had at least one treatment -emergent serious adverse reaction .  
In the pomalidomide alone versus pomalid omide  + low dose dexamethasone arms, respectively, most 
common serious adverse reactions (≥5%) were pneumonia (14%, 19%), renal failure (8%, 6%), 
dyspnea (5%, 6%), sepsis (6%, 3%), pyrexia (3%, 5%), dehydration (5%, 3%), hypercalcemia (5%, 
2%), urinary tra ct infection (0%, 5%), and febrile neutropenia (5%, 1%) .  
Venous Thromboembolism  
Patients receiving pomalidomide  have developed venous thromboembolic events reported as serious 
adverse reactions. In the trial, all patients were required to receive prophyla xis or antithrombotic 
treatment. The rate of DVT or PE was 3%. Consider anticoagulation prophylaxis after an assessment 
of each patient’s underlying risk factors.  
Hematologic Toxicity  
Page 35 of 74 
 Neutropenia of any grade was reported in 50% of patients and was the mo st frequently reported 
Grade 3/[ADDRESS_576323] 8 weeks 
and monthly thereafter. Treatment is conti nued or modified for Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities 
based upon clinical and laboratory findings. Dosing interruptions and/or modifications are 
recommended to manage neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Patients with a prior hi story of serious hypersensitivity associated with thalidomide or lenalidomide 
were excluded from studies and may be at higher risk of hypersensitivity.  
Dizziness and Confusional State  
18% of patients experienced dizziness and 12% of patients experienced a confusional state; 1% of 
patients experienced grade 3/4 dizziness, and 3% of patients experienced grade 3/[ADDRESS_576324] patients to avoid situations where dizziness or confusion may be a problem and not to 
take other medications that may cause dizziness or confusion without adequate medical advice.  
Neuropathy  
18% of patients experienced neuropathy (approximately 9% peripheral neuropathy). There were no 
cases of grade [ADDRESS_576325] as an 
investigational therapy outside of multiple myeloma.  
3.12 Methylprednisolone (Medrol)  
DESCRIPTION  
Methylprednisolone tablets contain methylpredniso lone which is a  glucocorticoid.  Glucocorticoids are 
adrenocortical steroids, both naturally  occurring and synthetic, which  are readily absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract. Methy lprednisolone occurs as a white  to practically white, odorless, crystalline 
powder. It is  sparingly soluble in alcohol, in  dioxane, and in methanol, slightly soluble in aceto ne, and 
in chloroform, and very  slightly soluble in ether. It is practically insoluble in water.  The chemical name 
[CONTACT_452151] -1,4-diene -3,20-dione, 1 1,17,21 -trihydroxy -6-methyl -, (6α,11β) -and 
the molecular weight is 374.48.   Each t ablet for oral administration contain s 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg 
or 32 mg of methylprednisolone.  
ACTIONS  
Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), whi ch also have saltretaining  
properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states.  
Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their potent anti -inflammatory effects in  
disorders of many organ systems.  
 
Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify  
Page 36 of 74 
 the body’s immune responses to diverse stimuli.  
 
INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE  
Methylprednisolone t ablets are indicated in the following conditions:  
1. Endocrine Disorders  
Primar y or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (hydrocort isone or cortisone is the first choice; 
synthetic analogs may be used in conj unction with mineralocorticoids where applicable; in infancy 
mineralocorticoid s upplementation is of particular importance).  
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia  
Nonsuppurative thyroiditis

WARNINGS  
In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unus ual stress, increased dosage of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_452068], during, and after the st ressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask 
some signs of infection, and new infections may a ppear during their use. Infections with any pathogen 
including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic infections, in any location of the bo dy, ma y 
be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive  
agents that affect cellular immunity, humoral immunity, or neutrophil function.  
These infections may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal. W ith increasing doses  
of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infe ctious complications increases.  There  
may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are  
used.  
 
Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce poster ior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma  
with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of  
secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses  
 
Usage in pregnancy:  Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done  
with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of  
child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against  
the potential ha zards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who  
have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully  
observed for signs of hypoadrenalism.  
 
Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood  pressure, salt 
and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with 
the synthetic derivatives e xcept when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium 
supplementation  may be necessary.  All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion.  
Page 40 of 74 
 Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contra indicated in patients receiving 
immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Kille d or inactivated vaccines may be  administered t o 
patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids; however  the response to such 
vaccines may be diminished. Indicated immunization procedures  may be undertaken in patients 
receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids.  
The use of me thylprednisolone t ablets in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of  
fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the  corticosteroid is used for the management of 
the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen . 
 
If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity,  
close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged  
corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophyla xis. 
 
Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to  
infections than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a  
more serious or even fatal course in non -immune children or adults on corticostero ids. In  
such children or adults who have not had these diseases particular care should be taken to  
avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affects  
the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a disseminated infection is not known. The c ontribution of the  
underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If  
exposed, to chicken pox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may  
be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled  intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may 
be indicated. If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral  agents may be considered. Similarly, 
corticosteroids should be used wi th great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides 
(threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid -induced immunosuppre ssion may lead to 
Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied  
by [CONTACT_80621] -negative se pticemia.  
PRECAUTIONS  
Drug -induced secondary adrenocortical insufficie ncy may be minimized by [CONTACT_452129]. This type of relative insufficien cy may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; 
therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be 
reinstituted. Since min eralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should 
be administered concurrently.  
There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on pati ents with hypothyroidism and in those with 
cirrhosis.  
Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients wit h ocular herpes simplex because of possible 
corneal perforation.  
The lowest possible dose o f corticosteroid should be used  to control the condition under treatment, 
and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.  
Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from eupho ria, insomnia, 
mood swings , personality changes, and severe  depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, 
existing emotional instability  or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by [CONTACT_13216].  
Page 41 of 74 
 Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ul cerative colitis, if t here is a probability of 
impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis;  fresh intestinal 
anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency;  hypertension; osteoporosis; and 
myasthenia gravis.  
Growth and development  of infants and children on p rolonged corticosteroid therapy should be 
carefully observed.  
Kaposi’s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy.  
Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical remission.  
Althou gh controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding  
the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple s clerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect 
the ultimate outcome or natural history  of the disease. The studi es do show that relatively high doses 
of corticosteroids  are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect.  
Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids a re dependent on the size of the dose and the 
duration of treatment, a risk/benefi t decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and 
duration  of treatment and as to whether daily or  intermittent therapy should be used.  
DRUG INTERACTIONS  
The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potential ly clinically important. Mutua l inhibition of 
metabolism occurs with co ncurrent use of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone; therefore, it is 
possible that adv erse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to 
occur.  Convulsions have been reported with concu rrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosp orin. 
Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampi n may increase the 
clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increases in methylp rednisolone dose to achieve 
the desired re sponse. Drugs such as troleandomycin a nd ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of 
methylprednisolone and thus decrease its cl earance. Therefore, the dose of methylprednisolone 
should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity.  
Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. This could  
lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when  
methylprednisolone is withdrawn. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_452069].  
 
The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of  
enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with  
corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the  
desired anticoagulant effect.  
Information for the Patient  
Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to  
avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should als o be advised that if they are  
exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
The initial dosage of methylprednisolone t ablets may vary from 4 mg to 48  mg of methylprednisolone 
per day depending on the specific d isease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower 
doses will generally suf fice while in selected patients higher initial doses m ay be required. The initial 
dosage should be mainta ined or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable 
period of time there is a lack of satisf actory clinical response, methylprednisolone  should be 
discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy.

4.2 International Staging Criteria  
In 2005, a new, international classification method was utilized for myeloma prognosis, based on the 
clinical and laboratory data gathered from 10,750 previously untreated symptomatic myeloma 
patients from 17 institutions in Asia, Europe, and North America .  The International Staging System 
utilizes a combination of serum β² microglobulin and serum albumin to provide a simple, powerful, 
and reproducible three -stage classification.  It was validated in patients younger and older than 65 
years; with standard t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_452071]; and in comparison with the Durie/Salmon staging 
system.

6.0 Treatment Plan  
Throughout treatment, antibiotic/antifungal/antiviral/anticoagulant prophylaxis will be administered as 
per institutional guidelines and SOPs.  
Infectious prophylaxis will include:  
1. Antibiotic s (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or doxycycline)  
2. Antifungals (e.g. clotrimazol e, fluconazole, voriconazole  or caspofungin ) 
3. Antivirals (e.g. acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir)  
The drugs listed above represent current commonly used prophylactic agents  within each category,  
but these may be substituted by [CONTACT_452132] -of-care 
prophylaxis may change over time.   All agents used for infection prophylaxis during the course of this 
study will be captured in the concomitant medication section of the Case Report forms (CRFs).  
Throughout  study treatment, supportive care will be administered as per institutional guidelines and 
SOPs.  
6.[ADDRESS_576331] of 1 cycle of combination D -PACE chemotherapy and peripheral 
blood stem cell collection. It is mandated that chemotherapy be given through a central venous 
access catheter to avoid potential complications of extravasation.  
D-PACE  
Dexamethasone  20 mg oral on days 1 -4 and 8 -11. 
Cisplatin  10 mg/m2/day on days  1-4 CI ( Continuous Infus ion).  
Doxorubicin  10 mg/m2/day on days 1 -4 CI.  
Cyclophosphamide  400 mg/m2/d ay or 600 mg/m2 on days 1 -4 CI*  
Etoposide  40 mg/m2/day on days 1 -4 CI 
See Appendix I for appropriate algorithms when computing chemotherapy doses. The daily dose of 
cyclophosphamid e, etoposide, and cisplatin will be infused over approximately 24 hours , for a total 
infusion time of approximately 96 hours.    
*Cyclophosphamide may be dose escalated from 400mg /m2 to 600 mg /m2 in cases of high -risk 
myeloma, based on an LDH ≥ 400 u/L or high -risk cytogenetics  [ t(4,14), t(14,16) and t(14,20) and 
del17p13 on FISH; del13 or del13q on metaphase cytogenetics, as per Mayo clinic criteria] .  
 
Page 48 of 74 
 PBSC (Peripheral Blood Stem Cell) Collection Guidelines  
Pegfilgrastim will be administered at a dose of 6 mg on days +6 and +13 after D -PACE 
chemotherapy.  If peripheral CD34 cell count is <20 µL, once WBC count is > 1,000/μL, G -CSF may 
be given at a dose of 10 mcg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest vial size) and divided in to a morning and 
evening dose , with the larger dose given in the morning.  G -CSF will be discontinued upon 
completion of apheresis.  If patient is unable to collect by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_576332] -D-PACE, plerixafor should be 
given as per SOP until the stem cell collection is completed.  
PBSC will be collected and processed according to institutional standards. These cells will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_452133]34 fo r a target of > 15 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. (5 x 
106 CD34+ cells/kg minimum necessary).     
Participants unable to collect at least 5 x 106 CD34/kg may undergo other collection(s) as per 
program practice.  Participants unable to collect at least 5 x 106 CD34/k g after two attempts will be 
removed from the protocol, since it is unlikely that they will complete 2 years of maintenance.   If the 
interval between the cycle of D -PACE and transplant is > 4 months (or >6 months in a participant that 
requires > 1 PBSC collection), that participant will be removed from the study.  
In the unlikely event that the PBSC product becomes contaminated with  excessive  myeloma  cells (≥ 
5%), participants will undergo a  second round of chemotherapy with VDT -PACE (see section 6.3 of 
this protocol for chemotherapy schedule) prior to an additional collection attempt in order to decrease 
the possibility of another myeloma -contaminated stem cell collection.   The same collect ion guidelines 
as above apply to this second round of chemo mobilization.      
 
Pre-Maintenance Therapy Modifications  
Cisplatin  doses will be modified for r enal insufficiency as follows:  
Cisplatin dose  Creatinine  
10 mg/m2 (full dose)  
 ≤1.5 mg/dl  
5 mg/m2  
 1.6 – 2.0 mg/dl  
 
0 mg/m2 (hold Cisplatin)  
 >2.0 mg/dl  
 
Dexamethasone:   If study participants are sensitive to steroids and experience a steroid “crash” 
when stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478], dexamethasone doses may be tapered after each dosing increment.  
Depend ing on the severity of the symptoms, 4 -8mg of dexamethasone may be given for two 
additional days before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_452072].   
 
For suspected dexamethasone -related toxicity  (non-infectious) ≥ grade 2 that does not abate or 
resolve with supportive care measures or a 7-14 day drug hold, methylprednisolone  16mg every 
other day may be prescribed as substitu tion.   
 
Page 49 of 74 
 Doxorubicin : For participants with hepatic dysfunction (transaminases > [ADDRESS_576333] bilirubin > 
2.0 mg/dl  if performed ) before the start of induction or consolidation , the doxorubicin dose should be 
reduced by 50%.  It may be raised if hepatic function improves.   For participants developi[INVESTIGATOR_452073], doxorubicin should be discontin ued.  
Thalidomide:   For grade 2 toxicity non -infectious or non -hematologic toxicity, thalidomide may be 
dose reduced to 50mg daily, de pending on the toxicity and possibility of recurrence/worsening with 
the re -introduction of therapy at full dose.  For ≥grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity, thalidomide will be 
held until toxicity resolves to a grade 2 or better.  Thalidomide may be resumed a t full dose 
(100mg/day) or dose -reduced to 50mg per day, depending on the toxicity and possibility of 
recurrence/worsening with the re -introduction of therapy at full dose. The rationale for the dose 
reduction must be recorded in source notes. Dose reducti ons below 50mg daily are not allowed.  
 
Interim between Induction D -PACE and Transplant  
Following D -PACE and PBSC collection, participants may receive interim dexamethasone at 20mg 
days [ADDRESS_576334] be document ed by [CONTACT_1963].   
6.2   Transplant Phase   
Transplant (VDT -MEL)  
Transplant should preferably occur 6 weeks after the induction PACE continuous infusion has been 
completed, but can occur as early as 4 weeks and as late as 3 months if the participant fails to 
mobilize stem c ells after the PACE administration.  Transplant may be given on an inpatient or 
outpatient basis .

Peripheral blood stem cell infusion will be given intravenously on day 0, i.e., at least 18 hours after 
the second dose of melphalan.  The participant will be pre -medicated according to institutional  
practice.  No le ss than approximately 5 x 106 /kg CD34cells  will be infused with the transplant.  
If deemed medically necessary  (graft failure, graft delay, inadequate platelet recovery , etc), 
and if a participant has sufficient st em cells in storage, a boost of  stem cell s may be given at 
any point after transplant , including subsequent treatment phases.

Note: A clarification to IMWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in patients in whom the only measurable disease is by [CONTACT_452139]: CR in such patients is defined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 –1.65 in addition to CR criteria listed above. (If one  of the serum free 
light chains is not measurable, the involved free light chain should be within or below the normal range.  VGPR in such patients is 
defined as a >90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) level s.  
3 Confirmation with repeat bone marrow biopsy not needed.  
4 Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the kappa/lambda ratio. An abnormal kappa/lambda ratio by [CONTACT_452140]/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells f or analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal 
clone is kappa/lambda of > 4:1 or < 1:2.  
5 All relapse categories require two consecutive assessments made at any  time before classification as relapse or disease progression 
and/or the inst itution of any new therapy. In the IMWG criteria, CR patients must also meet the criteria for progressive disease shown 
here to be classified as progressive disease for the purposes of calculating time to progression and progression -free survival. The 
definitions of relapse, clinical relapse and relapse from CR are not to be used in calculation of time to progression or progress ion-free 
survival.  
6 For progressive disease, serum M -component increases of >1 gm/dL are sufficient to define relapse if starting  M-component is >5 
g/dL.  
7 Relapse from CR has the 5% cut -off versus 10% for other categories of relapse.  
8 For purposes of calculating time to progression and progression -free survival, CR patients should also be evaluated using criteria 
listed above for progressive disease.  
Note: In ≥90% of MM patients, PD will be documented according to the above criteria.  However, in some cases, an investigator  may 
document PD prior to reaching the thresholds outlined in this table if holding salvage treatment until these thresholds are r eached is not 
clinically sound.  In such cases, PD may be documented earlier but must be cleared with the PI.   
MDS/AML   
All persistent cytopenias will be investigated by [CONTACT_452141][INVESTIGATOR_452074]/FISH.  
Participants who develop MDS not requi ring treatment will remain on study, but participants who 
develop MDS requiring treatment or AML will be taken off study.  
Survival Outcomes  
Progression -Free Survival:  measured from day [ADDRESS_576342] one day of trea tment on study.   
Overall Survival :  measured as the time from initial study enro llment to death from any cause.  
Event -Free Survival :  measured as the time from initial study enrollment to progression/relapse of 
disease or death from any cause.  
Performance  Status  
Participants will be graded according to the following ECOG grading scale. If a Karnofsky score is 
provided instead of an ECOG, performance status may be conv erted to the equivalent score.  
Grade                       Scale

Off Study Criteria  
Participants  will be informed during the informed consent process that they have the right to withdraw 
from the study at any time for any reason, without prejudice to their medical care.  The investigator also 
has the right to withd raw participants  from study treatment or from the study for any of the following 
reasons:  
 
Off Treatment Criteria  
 
• Initiation of ongoing medical treatment that makes it difficult to evaluate the safety or efficacy of 
study treatment  
• Occurrence of an adverse event that makes it unsafe to administer further study treatment  
• Major or recurrent non -compliance  
• Participant r equest  
• Failure to return for follow -up as required per study calendar  
• Deterioration in the patient’s condition, which may not be study  treatment -related, but which 
makes it unsafe to administer further treatment  
• Other  
 
 
Off Study Criteria  
 
• Participant request  
•  
• Inability to return for any further study visits, including follow -up visits.   
• Lost-to-Follow -Up  
•  
• Early termination of the study  
 
Unless the study  terminates early, HIPAA consent is withdrawn, or a participant is lost to follow -up, all 
study participants will be monitored for progression -free and overall survival.   
Page [ADDRESS_576343] 48 months.  Study power and sample size are based 
on the assumption of exponentially distributed progression times and use of maximum -likelihood 
methods (Lawless, 1982) to test the one -sided alternative hypothesis at the 5% level of significance.  
Accordin gly, the planned enrollment of 41 patients accrued uniformly over 3 years and followed for 4 
additional years will ensure 80% study power.

Suspension of Stud y    
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_452075]:  
For subjects enrolled on Total Therapy II, the mortality rate was found to be 6% for participants under 
65, and 12% for those over 65, with an overall mortality rate of 8%. Since we will be enrolling more 
heavi ly-pretreated participants (up to 12 months of prior therapy versus up to 1 month in Total 
Therapy II and III), and participants over 65, a treatment -related mortality rate of up to 1 5% is 
considered acceptable in this participant population.  
Treatment -Related Mortality calculations will include all deaths that are deemed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_452076], probably, or definitely related to treatment, that cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_452142], and are not related to relapse or prog ressive disease.     
 
Mortality Suspension Rules  
The study will be suspending and a DSMB review triggered if X deaths occur within the first N 
patients, for X/N = 2/4, 3/8, 4/12, 5/16, 6/20, 7/25, 8/29, 9/34, 10/39, and 11/41.  The probability of 
study suspension and the expected enrollment (if terminate d) are summarized in the table below over 
a range of hypothetical true mortality rates.  In it, the suspension probability can be seen to be 7.6% 
for the mortality rate of 15% deemed to be acceptable, and 73.8% for a rate of 30%.  The 
aforementioned sequen tial suspension rules were based on Pocock boundaries (1977) and computed 
with the ‘clinfun’ software (Ivanova et al., 2005; Seshan, 2013).

Statistical Analyses  
Overall analyses  
CR rate, EFS, TTP, and OS will be calculated for all participants who have signed an informed 
consent  form.   All analyses will be performed on an intent -to-treat basis.  The TTP is defined as the 
time that patient wi ll need either to start treatment if he/she is off treatment or will need a change in 
treatment if he/she was still on treatment.  The TTP study hypothesis  that the median TTP is [ADDRESS_576344] one day of 
induction treatment.  Toxicities will be compared descriptively to  historical controls . 
Interim analysis for efficacy  
The typi[INVESTIGATOR_452077](s). The proposed single -arm registry 
trial for multiple m yeloma participants proposes a treatment regimen that is more intensive than any 
other available therapy . Therefore,  with only one treatment regimen being considered  that is more 
intensive than applied in any other study , this study does not fit the multi -arm comparison setting, and 
it is unclear that an interim analysis for efficacy is beneficial.  Toxicity assessment , and not efficacy , 
will be the main reason for prematurely stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_452078].  
A second complication to an interim efficacy analysis is the short time period that would be available 
for participant follow -up. The study proposes to enroll [ADDRESS_576345] 
been followed long enough to experience a  relapse . Thus, it is unlikely that we would be able to draw 
any meaningful conclusions regarding TTP with an interim analysis . For these reasons, an interim 
analysis to evaluate treatment efficacy is not warranted for this single -arm trial.

The EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) is an integrated system for assessing the health -
related  quality of life (QoL ) of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials. The core  
questionnaire, the QLQ -C30, is the product of more than a decade of collaborative research.   It is a

12.0   Ethical and Regulatory  Considerations  
Definitions  
Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Participants or Others : Any event that is a) unanticipated b) 
caused harm or placed a person at increased risk of harm and c) is related to the research 
procedures.  
Serious Adverse Event:  An event is “serious” if it involves considerable detriment or harm to one or 
more persons (who may or may not be participants), or required intervention to prevent one or more 
persons from experiencing considerable detriment or harm. Serious advers e events include:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening experience – Disease or condition where the likelihood of death is high unless 
the course of the disease/condition is interrupted or diseases/conditions with potentially fatal 
outcomes where the end point of the cli nical trial analysis is survival  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in participant’s offspring  
• Any other important medical event that, based upon appr opriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
Page 60 of 74 
 the outcomes listed above. Examples include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blo od dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the development of drug dependency or drug abuse, suicidal 
ideation or attempts, or the unintentional revealing of some genetic information to insurers.  
Related : An event is “r elated” if more likely than not it was caused by [CONTACT_423875].  
Unexpected : An event is “unexpected” when its specificity, nature, severity or incidence are not 
accurately reflected in the consent form previously reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201]. E xamples 
include a lower rate of response to treatment or a side effect that is more severe than initially 
expected.  
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
The toxicity criteria to be used in this study are the Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse Events 
(CTCAE Version 4.0).  
Investigator Reporting Responsibilities  
To the IRB :  
The following must be reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_079], and, except where noted, 
such reporting is due no later than 10 business days  after the investigator’s first knowledge of the 
event:  
Deaths that are probably or definitely related to the study.  
Any event, other than death, that in the PI’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_452079], and Possibly, 
Probably or Definitely Related  to the study, regardless of whether the participant is on or off stud y.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_452080].  
An accidental or unintentional change ( Protocol Violation ) to the IRB -approved protocol that 
increases risk or decreases benef it, affects the participant’s rights, safety, welfare, affects the integrity 
of the data, or has the potential to occur again.  (NOTE: Any protocol violation that does not meet this 
definition should be reported with the next continuing review.)  
Pregnancie s occurring while the participant is on are considered immediate reportable events. The 
study regimen should be discontinued immediately.  
The treating investigator will follow the participant until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify 
the IRB of t he outcome within 10 business days.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_452081] a follow -up to the initial SAE.  
Any neonatal death that occurs within thirty (30) days of birth should be reported to the IRB, without 
regard to causality.  In  addition, any infant death after thirty (30) days that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_452082].  
Page [ADDRESS_576347] the IRB immediately by [CONTACT_756]. If time does not allow for this, the 
Investigator will notify the IRB of the deviation a s soon as possible in writing or by [CONTACT_648].  
Such contacts will be made as soon as possible to determine whether or not the participant (for whom 
the deviation from protocol was effected) is to continue in the study.  The participant’s research chart 
will co ntain a description of the deviation from the protocol and state the reasons for such deviation.  
The following must be reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 30 days of the PI’s first 
knowledge of the event:                        
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_452083] (e.g. FDA, NCI or NIH) . 
This includes any communication that questions the conduct of the research or suggests an 
impending inquiry, audit or investigation.  
Any publication in the liter ature, interim result, or other finding that indicates an unexpected change 
to the risk/benefit ratio  of the research must be reported to the IRB.  
Any breach in confidentiality  that may involve risk to a participant or others (Examples include the 
loss of a laptop computer on which subject identifies are stored or inadvertent loss study records) 
must be reported by [CONTACT_1201].  
Any participant complaint that indicates unanticipated risk  must be reported to the IRB.

Adverse events (AEs ≥ grade 3), for which expedited reporting is not required, will be monitored and 
recorded on the AE eCRF .AEs will not be recorded by [CONTACT_452144].   AEs will be recorded  as the worst grade achieved during that phase of 
treatment.   AEs will be categorized by [CONTACT_452145], and “other” will not be used  as a 
term within a system organ class unless there is no satisfactory alter native.     
Expedited reports will consist of an initial report and follow -up report when applicable (i.e. the initial 
report does not contain discharge/resolution information).  Follow up reports will be completed as 
data becomes available and within [ADDRESS_576350] a complete report submitted if reporting is required within 10 days of knowledge of 
the event.  These events will be reported as a single term (superordinate event) or syndrome.   These 
events will also be assessed for grade and  causality by [CONTACT_452146].  PI [INVESTIGATOR_452087] a disagreement between t he co -investigator and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_452088].    
Monitoring of Adverse Events  
All participants will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring the 
participant's clinical symptoms; laboratory, pathological, radiological, or surgical findings; physical 
examination; or other appropriate tests and procedures.  
For this study’s purposes, ≥grade 3 toxicities that are possibly, probably , or definitely relate d to the 
protocol treatment will be captured in participant case report forms (CRFs) from the time of the start 
of the study regimen through [ADDRESS_576351] protocol treatment administered.   
Any toxicities that meet the above criteria, but develop >[ADDRESS_576352] protocol treatment and 
are probably or definitely still related to treatment, will also be captured in the CRFs.

Reporting and Monitoring Requirements:  
All institutional investigator initiated trials (IITs), regardless of assigned risk level are subject to routine 
DSMC monitoring activities which may include but are not limited to review of signed consent 
documents, eligibility and adverse event reporting .  
 
All institutional IITs have the following reporting requirements  as part of their DSMP:  
• Provide an annual progress report to the DSMC and PRMC  
• Register subjects in HCCC’s Clinical Trial Management System, OnCore  
• Document Adverse Events  
• Document protoc ol deviations  
 
Risk Level 4  
Interventional treatment trials involving investigational agents or devices with a risk of death* (>5% or 
grade 4 – 5 SAE >5%), e.g. all investigator initiated INDs, most Phase I/II trials, gene therapy, gene 
manipulation or viral vector systems high -risk clinical procedures if performed solely for research 
purposes.  The use of a new chemical or drug for which there is limited or no available safety data in 
humans.  
 
 
 
Study Safety Review  
An independent study monitor and/or the DSMC Chair (or designee), wil l review study data (provided 
by [CONTACT_978]/available in OnCore) and communicate with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_330108].  A copy of this 
communication will be forwarded to the DSMC and PRMC Chairs.   
 
Page 64 of 74 
 Additional Reporting Requirements:  
- A scanned copy of the complete d eligibility checklist, with screening information and PI [INVESTIGATOR_59844], 
will be attached in OnCore for ongoing review by [CONTACT_330149].  
- Serious adverse events will be entered directly into an OnCore SAE report by [CONTACT_5051].  
OnCore will send an automat ic notification to the DSMC Chair/acting Chair and staff for review.  
- The DSMC utilizes a risk -based monitoring approach.  The trial's research records will be 
monitored at minimum twice per year.  Monitoring may be done more frequently depending on the 
protocol, risks to subjects, reported serious/adverse events, patient population and accrual rate.   
Records for a minimum of 25% of subjects will be monitored for the entire study.    
Monitoring will involve the following:  
• review eligibility of patients acc rued to the study,  
• check for the presence of a signed informed consent,  
• determine compliance with protocol’s study plan,  
• determine whether SAEs are being appropriately reported to internal and external 
regulatory agencies,  
• compare accuracy of data in the research record with the primary source documents,  
• review investigational drug processing and documentation,  
• assess cumulative AE/SAE reports for trends and compare to study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
 
Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 
For non -serious Adverse Events  (AEs ≥ grade 3), documentation must begin from the first day of 
study treatment and typi[INVESTIGATOR_452089] 30 day follow -up period after treatment is 
discontinued.   
 
Collected information should be recorded in the electronic/Case Report Form s (eCRF/CRF) for that 
subject. A description of the event, its severity or toxicity grade (according to NCI’s Common Toxicity 
Criteria (CTCAE) ), onset and resolved d ates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study drug 
should be included. Documentation should occur in real time. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_452090].  
 
 
 
 
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 
For any experience or condition that meets the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE), recording 
of the event must begin after signing of the informed consent and continue through the 30 day follow -
up period after treatment is discontinued.  
Reporting requirements are outlined on page 67. An adverse event is considered serious  if it results 
in ANY of the following outcomes:   
 
1. Death  
2. A life -threatening adverse event  
Page 65 of 74 
 3. An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_452091] ≥ [ADDRESS_576353] normal 
life functions  
5. A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6. Important Medical Events (IME) that m ay not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32 ; ICH E2A and ICH E6 ). 
 
 
Data Monitoring and Management  
All studies that undergo PRMC review and/or utilize HCCC Clinical Research Services (CRS) 
resources are required to register subjects in OnCore. Subject registration includes the following:  
• Consent date and the IRB approved consent used  
• Date of eligibility and eligibility status (eligible, not eligible)  
• On study date and subject’s disease site  (and histology if applicable)  
• On treatment date (if applicable)  
 
Subject Data  
 
In addition to the subject registration and subject status data entered in OnCore for all HCCC trials, 
research staff also enters the subject study data into electronic case r eport forms (eCRFs) for HCCC 
investigator initiated studies. eCRFs are approved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_452092]. All information on eCRFs will be traceable to the source 
documents which are  generally maintained in the subject’s file. eCRF data are expected to be 
entered into OnCore within [ADDRESS_576354]’s study visit.  
 
 
 
 
Forms Monitoring  
 
OnCore eCRF data are monitored on a routine basis (dependent on accrual) to ensure a ll mandatory 
fields are entered completely, accurately and within time requirements. The assigned DSMC monitor 
manages the logistics associated with the data monitoring review. Once the clinical trial is identified 
for monitoring, the monitor arranges for a selection of cases to review from among the subjects 
registered in OnCore.  As part of the forms monitoring process, the assigned monitor will issue 
queries within the eCRF to resolve missing, incomplete and/or incorrect information. A member of the 
research team is expected to respond to monitoring queries within [ADDRESS_576355]’s data record is continually available to the PI, research staff, and DSMC 
from OnCore’s Biostat Console. The availability of this information is a valuable tool for the 
preparation of final reports and manuscripts as well as ongo ing deficiency reports.

Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described by [CONTACT_60836] (Federal Register 
Vol 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 50) and the Office for Protection from Research Risks Reports: 
Protection of Human Subjects (Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46).  They must be followed in 
order to comply with FDA regulations for the conduct and monitoring of clinical investigations.  
Institutional Review  
This study must be approved by [CONTACT_4707], as defined by [CONTACT_452147] (Ref Federal Register Vol. 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 56) and the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks Reports: Protection of Human Subjects (Code of Federal Regulations 
45 CFR 46).  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_452093] (initial application, amendments, continuing 
reviews, SAEs, protocol violations, reports of information, etc) to the pertinent IRB and for obtaining 
and maintaining written IRB approval for thi s study.  IRB approval must be obtained prior to the 
initiation of the study.  Amendments to the protocol may not be instituted without written IRB approval.  
Drug Accountability  
Because all of the study drugs employed in this schema are commercially appro ved and have been 
used extensively in the treatment of multiple myeloma, investigational drug accountability logs will not 
be kept.  
Participant medication diaries will be issued to each study participant in order to track compliance 
with taking the study protocol’s oral, therapeutic medications and will be collected at clinic visits.  
Participants will have the option of faxing or e -mailing their medication diaries as well.  If a participant 
fails to return his/her medication diaries more than three times  consecutively , he/she will be 
considered for remov al from the study for participant non -compliance .  
Concomitant Medications  
Recording of concomitant medications will be limited to infection prophylaxis, infection treatment, and 
any newly ordered medicati ons used to treat an event requiring expedited reporting.     
 
Study Records Requirements  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_452094] a minimum of [ADDRESS_576356] to a field audit by [CONTACT_452148]. Therefore, careful attention should be paid to 
ensuring that all study records are complete, accurate , filed and retained by [CONTACT_737].  
Page 67 of 74 
 The Principal Investigat or, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at 
some time during auditing visits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to 
the participant’s records (e.g. medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_452095], and study related charts) 
for source data verification. All study documents must be made available to the auditing 
representative so that the accuracy and completeness may be confirmed.

Instructions for Determining Body Weight  
For participants with weight <60kg,  or who are under 5 ft tall,  all doses will be based on actual body 
weight.  
For participants with weight >60kg  and who are at least 5 ft tall,  doses will be based on adjusted body 
weight, not to exceed a BSA of 2.0m2 during the D -PACE, transplant  and consolidation phases.  
However, d uring the maintenance phase, adjusted body weight is preferred, but not required for 
participants with weight >[ADDRESS_576357] 5 ft tall.   
1. Actual Body Weight  (ABW) is the weight in Kg.  
2. Adjusted body weight  (ABW): ABW = IBW + 0.4(actual weight - IBW) . 
Ideal Body Weight  (IBW):  
Males:  IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet or 60 inches  
Females: IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet or 60 inches

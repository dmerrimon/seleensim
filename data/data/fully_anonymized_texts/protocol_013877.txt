 Overview of Study Design:    
This is a phase I/II study of MLN9708 for the prophylaxis of chronic GVHD in patients undergoing 
allogeneic HSCT. During the phase I portion patients undergoing both sibling and unrelated donor 
transplantation will be enrolled on the same arm to determine the DLT an d MTD. During the phase 
II portion of the trial, patients will be enrolled into two separate and independent cohorts: a) Matched 
sibling transplants and b) Unrelated donors transplants. Both cohorts will be enrolled and analyzed 
separately.

 1. Introduction:    
 
Graft-versus -host disease (GVHD) is one of the most frequent complications after 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)  1. Acute and chronic forms of 
GVHD  develops in 30 -75% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_512849], number of T -cells in the graft, 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s age and GVHD prophylactic regimen used  2-4. Novel strategies designed to 
effectively prevent the development of this life threatening complication of allogeneic 
transplantation are urgently needed. Immune modulation with atorvastatin in matche d sibling 
transplantation, in our experience has shown promise in preventing acute GVHD;  however 
rates of chronic GVHD remain high. No pharmacological agents are currently approved or 
considered standard treatment for preventing chronic GVHD, following all ogeneic HSCT. 
Extensive preclinical and clinical data (discussed in  subsequent sections) suggest  efficacy of 
proteasome inhibitors as novel agents, with potential to prevent chronic GVHD . MLN9708 is 
an oral proteasome inhibitor, associated with reduced ris k of peripheral neuropathy. The 
current phase I/II study aims to investigate the role of MLN9708, as a novel, oral 
pharmacological prophylaxis for chronic GVHD in patients receiving standard acute GVHD 
prophylaxis post allogeneic HSCT.    
 
Pathophysiology o f Acute GVHD:  
Acute GVHD is initiated when donor T cells encounter host APCs in lymphoid t issues 
and become activated 5. This T -cell activation process requires co -stimulation via CD80 and 
CD86, which are up -regul ated on APCs during the early phase of acute  GVHD. Activation is 
enhanced by [CONTACT_512870]. Local proinflammatory 
cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL -1), and interferon (IFN) -
gamma, promote  Th-[ADDRESS_663681] tissues  6. Massive cytokine release related to the Th -1 phenotype 
predicts the incidence and severity of acu te GVHD in both murine models and humans, 
whereas patients with high IL -10 production are less at risk for GVHD development  7-9.

 Statins  as Potential M odulator s of GVHD : 
HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), the cholesterol -lowering drugs that are 
prescribed worldwide to prevent and treat atherosclerosis, are increasingly being recognized 
to exhibit a variety of  immunomodulatory properties 10. Reduced mevalonate production by 
[CONTACT_101818], not only inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol but also that of key isoprenoid 
intermediate molecules required for the isoprenylation of GTP -binding cell signaling prote ins 
such as Ras, Rho and Rac 11. By [CONTACT_512871], statins affect 
intracellular signaling pathways and cellular functions such as differentiation, motility, 
secre tion and proliferation 12, 13. Inhibiting Ras leads to a bias towards T helper type 2 (Th -2) 
cell development, and inhibition of pro -inflammatory Th -[ADDRESS_663682] the development of regulatory T (Treg) cells, 
as exposure of human CD4+ T cells to atorvastatin in vitro  increases expression of forkhead 
box P3 (FOXP3)  15. In fact . increased numbers of circulating FOXP3+ Treg cells are present 
in dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_512850] [ADDRESS_663683] effects on T 
cells, statins can also indirectly decrease T -cell a ctivation by [CONTACT_512872] -γ–induced 
expression of major histocompatibility complex class (MHC) II and by [CONTACT_512873] -
regulation of a variety of co -stimulatory molecules and cytokines in antigen presenting cells 
(APCs)  12. Hence statins appear to suppress T cell –dependent immune responses at many 
levels and hold promise as a new class of immunomodulatory drugs, with potential role in 
preventing acute GVHD.  
 
Statins and Murine Acute GVHD:  
Zeiser and colleagues  [ADDRESS_663684] acute GVHD in 
a MHC mismatched mouse model. In a series of elegant experiments, the authors 
demonstrated reduced risk of lethal acute GVHD by [CONTACT_094] -treating the don or mice with 
atorvastatin. T -cells derived from these atorvastatin pre -treated mice not only showed 
reduced proliferation potential, but also displayed (both in -vivo and in -vitro) reduced Th -1 
cytokine (TNF, IFN -gamma) and increased Th -2 cytokine (IL -10, IL-4) production. Zeiser 
and colleagues also investigated the impact of atorvastatin administration to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_241628]. 
Atorvastatin when given to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_512851] a 
long-term survival of 50%, compared with 0% su rvival in control animals. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_512852], spleen, and lymph nodes of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_512853] 03-13-[ADDRESS_663685] significant finding was that 
atorvastatin pretreatment did not interfere with perforin -mediated cytolysis or Fas –Fas-ligand 
interaction –mediated killing. In summary , these key experiments highlight the potential of  
atorvastatin in protecting against acute GVHD, while preserving the graft -versus -leukemia 
(GVL) effects.  
 
Clinical  Trial Data for Statin use for P reventing GVHD : 
A number of retrospective studies suggest projective role of statins against acute and 
chron ic GVHD 17-19. Based on this data, our group conducted  a single -arm phase -II study 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin for the prophylaxis of acute graft -versus -
host disease in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing HLA -matched sibling 
donor hematopoietic SCT  (www.clinicaltrials.gov  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Atorvastatin 
administration in healthy donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_512854] 3 -4 
adverse events. The cumulative incidence rates of grade II -IV acute GVHD at days +100 and 
+180 were 3.3% (95%CI=0.2 - 14.8%) and 11.1% (95%CI=2.7 -26.4%), res pectively. The 1 -
year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 52.3% (95%CI=27.6 -72.1%). One -year 
cumulative incidences of non -relapse mortality and relapse were 9.8% (95%CI=1.4 -28%) 
and 25.4% (95%CI=10.9 -42.9%), respectively. The 1 -year overall survival a nd progression -
free survival were 74% (95%CI=58 -96%) and 65% (95%CI=48 -87%), respectively. 
Compared to baseline, atorvastatin administration in sibling donors was associated with a 
trend towards increased mean plasma interleukin -10 concentrations (5.6pg/ml  vs. 7.1 pg/ml; 
p=0.06). This study showed that a novel two -pronged strategy of atorvastatin administration 
to both donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_512855] a feasible, 
safe and potentially effective strategy to prevent acute G VHD ( manuscript submitted for 
publication ). In an ongoing  protocol, we are evaluating  the role of atorvastatin for the 
prophylaxis of acute GVHD when administered to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s of matched sibling and 
unrelated donor transplants alone, to assess if routine administration of atorvastatin to healthy 
sibling donors is warranted  (www.clinicaltrials.gov  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). The results of 
Version Date 03-13-18 Amendment  5 
16 
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and the preliminary observations from  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] suggest that while an 
atorvastatin -based  GVHD prophylaxis  provides protection against acute GV HD; compared 
to historical controls 3, 4 the incidence of chronic GVHD remains high and represent s a 
significant clinic al challenge . This preliminary data underscore s the need to develop 
prophylactic strategies for chronic GVHD in allogeneic transplant patients getting 
atorvastatin based acute GVHD prophylaxis in particular, and for patients undergoing 
allografting in gene ral.  
 
Role of B -cells in Pathogenesis of C hronic GVHD : 
Although the exact causes of chronic GVHD remain unknown, higher antibody levels 
have been associated with autoimmunity and implicated in chronic GVHD 20. Newly 
diagnosed patients with extensive chronic GVHD have elevated soluble B cell activating 
factor (BAFF) levels and anti -double -strand DNA antibodies 21, 22, suggesting that B -cells 
play a role in chronic GVHD pathogenesis. Peripheral B cells in post allogeneic transplant 
patients with chronic GVHD have significantly higher BAFF/B -cell ratios compared with 
patients without chronic GVHD 23. In chronic GVHD, increasing BAFF concentrations 
correlate with increased numbers of circulating pre -germinal center (GC) B -cells and post -
GC "plasmablast -like" cells, suggesting in vivo BAFF dependence of these two CD27+ B -
cell subsets 23. The patients who develop chronic GVHD have delayed reconstitution of naive 
B-cells despi[INVESTIGATOR_512856]27+ B cells 
in the first year after transplantation 23. B cells from chronic GVHD patients are 
hyperresponsive to Toll -like receptor -[ADDRESS_663686] significantly increased 
signaling through ERK and AKT that is associated with decreased levels of proapoptotic 
Bim, suggesting a mechanistic link between elevated BAFF levels and aberrant B -cell 
survival 25. Altered B cell homeostasis in chron ic GVHD is associated with persistence of 
circulating, potentially autoreactive, B -cells 23. A murine study demonstrated that allogeneic 
antibody deposit in chronic GVHD -affected tissues, and chronic GVHD was p revented when 
the donor graft was genetically prevented from secreting IgG 26. Moreover , during GVHD 
onset, donor B -cells are activated by [CONTACT_381216]4+  T cells to upregulate MHC II and

 costimulatory molecules. Ac ting as efficient APCs, donor B -cells augment donor CD4+ 
clonal  T-cell expansion, autoreactivity, IL -7Rα expression, and survival. These qualitative 
chang es markedly augment donor CD4+  T cells' capacity in mediating autoimmune -like 
chronic GVHD 27. Collectively these data support an integral role of B -cell in the 
pathogenesis of chronic GVHD.  
  
Rituximab for Chronic GVHD Prophylaxis : 
Treatment of steroid refractory c hronic GVHD patients with rituximab, a B cell –depleting  
anti-CD20 monoclonal an tibody, has shown encouraging  activity 28, 29, with overall response 
rates of 29% to 36% for oral, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and lung c hronic GVHD, and 60% for 
cutaneous  chronic GVHD 30 in aggregate data from multiple trials.  Based on rituximab’s 
activity in the steroid refractory setting, recent studies have evaluated its role as chronic 
GVHD prophylactic agent. Rituximab added to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide 
conditioning resulted in a low rate of c hronic GVHD in 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
patients 31. Arai S et al. used prophylactic  rituximab  2 months after transplantation to 
decrease the incidence of c hronic GVHD  32. The study included 35 patients undergoing total 
lymphoid irradiation/ antithymocyte globulin conditioning. Rituximab (375 mg/m2) was 
infused weekly on days 56, 63, 70, and 77  after transplantation. The incidence of acute 
GVHD was 6%. The cumulative incidence of c hronic GVHD was 20%. Non -relapse 
mortality was 3%. Rituximab treatment after allogeneic transplantation significantly reduced 
B-cell allogeneic immunity, with complete  prevention of alloreactive H -Y Ab development 
in male patien ts with female donors (P = .01) 32. Similarly Cutler and colleagues using an 
alternative rituximab prophylaxis schedule reported chronic GVHD and systemic 
corticosteroid -requiring chronic GVHD  cumulative incidence  at 2 years from transplantation 
of 48% and 31% respectively, both lower than the corresponding rates in a concurrent control 
cohort (60%, p=0.1 and 48.5%, p=0.015)  28. 
In addition to infusion reactions, cost and requirements for parenteral administration, 
rituximab used post AHCT can also potentially lead to life threate ning neutropenia and 
infections. McIver et al reported the rituximab  administration within six months  of an  
allogeneic transplant was  associated with prolonged , profound and life -threatening 
cytopenias 33. In experience by [CONTACT_512874] n eutropenia after rituximab infusion was observed 
in 40% of the patients an d should be a caution when using rituximab after transplantation  32.

Proteasome Inhibitors and GVHD : 
Bortezomib is the prototype proteasome inhibitor.  Bortezomib is effective against multiple 
myeloma via inhibition of nuclear factor –κB, attenuation of interleukin (IL) -[ADDRESS_663687], and possibly antiangiogenic and other mechanisms . Nuclear 
factor –κB plays an important role in cytokine signaling and T -cell activation, proliferation, 
and apoptosis 34, 35. Bortezomib inhibits APCs by [CONTACT_512875] -like-receptor 4 –mediated 
activation, with reduced cytokine production and immunostimulatory activity 36. In addition, 
treatment of CD4+ T cells with bortezomib was found to preserve natural regulatory T -cells 
while allowing the emergence of a distinct suppressor T cell population that inhibited the 
proliferation, IFN -γ production, and CD40L expr ession in stimulated effector T cells 37. In 
the preclinical setting, bortezomib preferentially and specifically depletes alloreactive T 
lymphocytes 38. In mouse models of HLA -mismatched allografting, administration of 
bortezomib protects against GVHD without impairing engraftment 39, 40. In summary 
proteasome inhibition eliminates alloreactive plasma cells and a lloreactive T cells. 
Furthermore, it interferes with APC function and reduces inflammatory cytokine production 
either by [CONTACT_512876] -secreting cell or by [CONTACT_512877] -κB-dependent transcription, su pporting the role of proteasome 
inhibitors as GVHD prophylactic agents.  
Mateos -Mazon et al. 41found that bortezomib may be useful in the management of chronic 
GVHD. The investigators administered bortezomib to 8  patients who relapsed after reduced -
intensity conditioning allogeneic transplantation. At the time of bortezomib administration, 4 
patients had chronic GVHD, including severe punctate keratopathy in 3 patients. 
Interestingly, in all 4 patients, chronic GV HD significantly improved; especially in the 3 
patients with ocular involvement, in whom both symptoms and conjunctival ulcerations 
responded. As previously shown and noted by [CONTACT_473], NF -κB activation plays a 
crucial function in inflammatory eye  disease; therefore, NF -κB blockade may have an 
important role in the management of ocular GVHD 42. In another study by [CONTACT_26131] -Cheikh et al. 43, 
bortezomib was administered as salvage treatment after multiple myeloma relapse or 
progression after allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 37 patients. Before the start of 
treatment, 8 patients were suffering limited chronic GVHD, whereas 3 patients ha d extensive 
signs. Two of the 3 patients with extensive chronic GVHD signs before the start of treatment 
Version Date 03-13-18 Amendment  5 
19 
 showed a significant improvement in GVHD.  Koreth et al 44 used bortezomib for acute 
GVHD prophylaxis in a phase  I/ trial. They found that 180 -day cumulative incidence of 
grades II to IV acute GVHD was 22%. One -year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD 
was only 29%.  Disease relapse were comparable to historical controls, underscoring the fact 
that proteasome inhibit ors do not interfere with GVL effects.  Taken together, the above 
results demonstrate the potential of proteasome inhibitors in the prevention of chronic 
GVHD due to marked immunomodulatory activity . However, administration of bortezomib 
requires parentera l or subcutaneous administration and is often complicated by [CONTACT_512878]. To circumvent these limitations, MLN9708, a novel  oral proteasome 
inhibitor with reduced risk of peripheral neuropathy warrant s investigation for chronic 
GVH D prophylaxis, in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation.  
  
MLN9708 : 
 
Preclinical Experience  
 
Please refer to the current MLN9708 Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and Safety 
Management Attachment (SMA).  
Clinical Experience  
 
As of [ADDRESS_663688] been treated with MLN9708 across 9 enrolling, 
sponsor -led phase 1 or phase 1/2 studies evaluating both twice -weekly and weekly dosing 
schedules.  MLN9708 is available as an intravenous and oral formulation. Regardless of the 
route of administrat ion in the twice -weekly dosing schedule, MLN9708 is given on Days 1, 
4, 8, and 11 of a 21 -day cycle; in the weekly dosing schedule, the drug is given on Days 1, 8, 
and 15 of a 28 -day cycle. To date, the development of oral MLN9708 has focused on 
multiple myeloma [relapsed and/or refractory and newly diagnosed] and systemic light chain 
amyloidosis. A clinical pharmacology study looking at drug -drug interactions, the effect of 
food, and bioavai lability also uses the oral formulation. Details of these trials can be found in 
Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism ClinicalTrials.gov and the MLN9708 IB.  
 
Version Date 03-13-18 Amendment  5

 Clinical IV and PO pharmacokinetic (PK) data show that MLN9708 (measured as the 
biologically acti ve boronic acid form of MLN9708 [MLN2238]) has multi -exponential 
disposition with a rapid initial phase that is largely over in [ADDRESS_663689] maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 
approximately 0.5 to 2.0 hours and terminal t1/2 after multiple dosing of approximately 5 to 
7 days 45.  Results of a population PK analysis (N = 137) show that there is no relationship 
between body surface area (BSA) or body weight a nd clearance (CL).  Also, based on 
stochastic simulations for fixed dose, exposures are independent of the individual patient’s 
BSA. [2] Based on this data, a recommendation was made for fixed dosing  (4mg on d ays 1, 8, 
and 15 of a 28 -day cycle ) in the clinical trial.  Hence, the 4mg dose will be the highest dose 
level tested, in the phase 1 portion of current clinical trial.  An absolute bioavailability of 67% 
was determined for MLN9708 using the population PK analysis. Metabolism appears to be 
the major route  of elimination for MLN9708, with negligible urinary excretion of the parent 
drug (< 3% of dose).  In vitro studies of liver microsomes show that MLN9708 is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_20550] P450 enzymes (CYPs) and non -CYP enzymes/proteins.  
The rank orde r of relative biotransformation activity of the 5 -major human CYP isozymes is 
3A4 (34.2%) > 1A2 (30.7%) > 2D6 (14.7%) > 2C9 (12.1%) > 2C19 (< 1%).  MLN9708 is 
not an inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor is it a time -dependent inhibitor 
of CYP 3A4/5.  The potential for MLN9708 treatment to produce DDIs via CYP inhibition is 
inferred to be low; however, there may be a potential for DDIs with a concomitant strong 
CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inhibitor because of the potential for first -pass metabolism when 
MLN9708 is administered via the PO route and because of the moderate contribution of 
CYP3A4 - and CYP1A2 -mediated metabolism of MLN9708 in human liver microsomes.  
MLN9708 may be a weak substrate of P glycoprotein (P -gp), breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCR P), and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP2) efflux pump transporters.  
MLN9708 is not an inhibitor of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2.  The potential for DDIs with 
substrates or inhibitors of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is, therefore, inferred to be low.

The clinical experience with MLN9708 also shows early signs of antitumor activity as  evidenced 
by [CONTACT_2669] a 50% reduct ion in disease burden in some patients and prolonged  disease 
stabilization in others across all ongoing trials. The antitumor activity has been seen  with single -
agent MLN9708, when combined with established therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and across the  malignancies studied 
(advanced solid tumors  46, non -Hodgkin ’s disease, Hodgkin ’s disease  47, relapsed and/or

Though additional data are needed to characterize the clinical benefit of this drug, the  emerging 
data supports the ongoing development of MLN9708.  
 
Of particular relevance to this study (C16011) is the clinical experience from Studies C16004 
and C16007 in which single -agent MLN9708 is administered weekly in patients with RRMM or 
RRAL, respectively.  
 
Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma  
Study C16004 is an open -label, dose -escalation, phase [ADDRESS_663697] included bortezomib, tha lidomide (or lenalidomide), and 
corticosteroids. The  dose-escalation phase of the trial has completed. In this study, 2 of 3  patients 
experienced protocol -defined DLTs (Grade 3 ras h and Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) 
at a dose of 3.95 mg/m2. As per protocol, subsequent patients were treated at  1 dose level below 
(2.97mg/m2) where 1 of 6 patients experienced a DLT (Grade 3 nausea,  vomiting, and diarrhea). 
The MTD of weekly oral MLN9708 was determined to be  2.97 mg/m2.  
Once the MTD was established, cohorts of patients representing the heterogeneous pa tient 
population currently seen in clinical practice were enrolled i n order to further evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics of ora l MLN9708. The MTD expansion 
cohorts enrolling are:  
1. Relapsed and Refractory expansion cohort [r efractory is defined as disease progression while 
on therapy or within [ADDRESS_663698] dose of therapy];  
2. Carfilzomib expansion cohort  
3. Proteasome Inhibitor -Naïve expansion cohort  
4. VELCADE -Relapsed expansion cohort  
Final study results  are not available for this ongoing trial, but preliminary data suggest  
MLN9708 has antitumor activity in heavily pretr eated MM patients, with durable 
responses/disease control, and is generally well tolerated.54, 55

the safety, tolerability, and MTD, as well as to determine hematologic and organ response rates 
in this patie nt population. The starting dose level was selected from Study C16004 as previously 
described. In Study C16007 the dose was switched from the BSA -based dosing to the fixed dose, 
thereby [CONTACT_941] 4.0 mg fixed starting dose in Study C16007 corresponds to the 2.23  mg/m2 dose (one 
dose level below MTD) from Study C16004. This study is currently enrolling patients in the 
dose-expansion portion of the trial.  
As of [ADDRESS_663700] dose level of 4.0 mg, 
1 of 6 pat ients experienced a protocol -defined DLT (that is, thrombocytopenia that lasted more 
than 2 weeks, which met the definition of a DLT due to the delay in starting Cycle 2). As per 
protocol, the dose was escalated to 5.5 mg for the next cohort of patients wh ere 2 of 5 patients 
experienced a DLT (Grade 3 diarrhea, n=1; and Grade [ADDRESS_663701], n=1). The latter patient did not appear to have cardiac AL 
amyloidosis by [CONTACT_207111], but did have substantial renal involvement. After 
the occurrence of this DLT, diagnoses included cardiac involvement and CHF. The MTD of 
weekly oral MLN9708 was determined to be 4.0 mg. Following the establishment of the MTD, 
patients are currently being e nrolled in to 1 of 2 cohorts: proteasome inhibitor naïve or 
proteasome inhibitor exposed.56 
As of the 30 April 2012 data cut, the patients enrolled in the study are considered heavily 
pretreated, as evidenced by a m edian number of 3 prior lines of therapy (range 1 –7), with 38% 
and 46% of patients having been previously treated with bortezomib and lenalidomide, 
respectively. To be eligible for the study, patients must have amyloid involvement of the heart, 
kidney, or both; at the data cut the organ involvement distribution was 6, 4, and [ADDRESS_663702] received a median of 2.5 cycles of therapy (range, 1 -12). Eight 
patients remain on treatment. Early signs of activity have been reported. There w ere [ADDRESS_663703] 1 cycle of therapy with completed response assessments (9 in the 4.0

rise in serum creatinine, dyspnea, and cardiac arrest treated at 5.5 mg, as noted above). No death 
has been reported.  
The potential risks reported with MLN9708 use, poo led from all studies using the oral 
formulations, were anticipated based on preclinical data and previous experience with 
VELCADE and are noted in the MLN9708 IB, SMA, and ICF documents. Regardless of whether 
MLN9708 is administered on the once weekly or t wice weekly dosing schedule, there is 
consistency among the type of TEAEs reported, despi[INVESTIGATOR_207082]. While the predominant potential toxicities may be severe in some 
cases, they are largely reve rsible, and can be managed by [CONTACT_512879], which may include dose reductions and supportive care. Please 
refer to the MLN9708 IB and SMA for further information.  
Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM)  
In Study C16005, MLN9708 is given weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), in combination with 
lenalidomide (Days 1 -21), and dexamethasone (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in a 28 -day cycle.  
Enrollment to this study is closed.   
Clinical data as of 30 April 2012 is available.  The MTD in Study C16005 was determined to be  
2.97 mg/m2 given weekly in a 28 -day cycle with LenDex.  The DLTs were urticarial rash, 
dizziness, nausea, orthostatic hypotension, vomiting, diarrhea , and syncope.  The recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP 2D) estimation was established following evaluation of the available data from 
the phase 1 portion of the trial which included, but was not limited to, analyses of efficacy results

 and adverse events (Grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs, all grades peripheral neuropathy, and treatment 
discontinuation).  Given that the dose of MLN9708 at 2.97 mg/m2 compromised the maximal 
dosing of lenalidomide and that the dose of 2.23 mg/m2 is very tolerable and clinically active, 
Millennium designated 2.23 mg/m2 as the RP2D after evaluation of the data and discussion with 
investigators.  The RP2D of 2.23 mg/m2 has been translated into a fixed dose of 4.0 mg based on 
the results from the population PK analysis.   Enrollment in this study has been completed; final 
study results are not available , but preliminary data suggests oral MLN9708 given weekly plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone in a 28 -day cycle appears well tolerated with manageable 
toxicity and encouraging antitumor activity.   
In Study C16005, 15 of 15 (100%) patients in the dose esca lation portion of the study 
experienced at least 1 TEAE irrespective of grade or causality.  At the MTD across all dose 
expansion cohorts 49 of 53 patients (including 3 patients from the dose escalation cohort [92%]) 
reported at least [ADDRESS_663705] common AE reported (38%).  Other common AEs reported include nausea (32%), 
constipation (30%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (23%), and peripheral oedema  (21%).  Skin 
toxicity, primarily erythem atous rash, occurred in 62% of patients (of note, rash is an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_207083]9708 and lenalidomide).  Peripheral neuropathy was reported in 
13% of patients; Grade 3 in 1 patient.   
A summary of the overall safety profile of patients treated in  Study C16005 is outlined in  Table

Clinical Trial Experience Using the Intravenous Formulation of 
MLN9708  
See the IB for descriptions of the 2 ongoing studies investigating IV MLN9708 in advanced solid 
tumors and advanced lymphoma (Studies C16001 and C16002, respectively).  
Study Rationale:  
Proteasome inhibition eliminates alloreactive T cells, interferes with AP C function and 
reduces inflammatory cytokine production either by [CONTACT_512876] -secreting cell or 
by [CONTACT_512880] -κB-dependent transcription, 
supporting the role of proteasome inhibitors as GVHD prop hylactic agents. Based on the 
previously discussed preclinical and limited clinical data, we now propose  a phase I/II study 
of chronic GVHD prophylaxis with oral proteasome inhibitor MLN9708 in patients 
undergoing matched related or unrelated donor allogen eic transplantation.  Phase I will be 
conducted as a single site study  and Phase II as a multi -site study .  The additional site,  the 
University of West Virginia , will be added when the Phase II portion of the study is opened .  
Building on our prior experien ce showing reduced rates of acute GVHD with an atorvastatin -
containing acute GVHD prophylaxis, the preferred acute GVHD prophylactic regimen  on the 
current study will be atorvastatin, mini -dose methotrexate and tacrolimus; however the acute 
GVHD prophylaxi s used will remain at the discretion of the treating physician since rate of 
acute GVHD  is not the primary out come  of the current protocol. Furthermore flexibility in 
type of acute GVHD prophylaxis permitted , will support robust accrual on the current 
protocol.

Phase I patients will be seen weekly for toxicity assessment during the DLT period.  
 
GVHD Assessment:  
At the time of enrollment and/or first dose of MLN9708 patients will be graded for acute 
and chronic GVHD. Subsequently  patients will be monitored for development  of acu te and 
chronic GVHD approximately once a week until day +100. After Day 100, patients will be 
assessed at each study visit for the presence of GVHD . Diagnosis of acute GVHD will 
ideally require biopsy confirmation  in at least one involved organ . Whe n more than one 
organ is involved , biopsy confirmation of all involved organs is recommended but not 
necessary . Liver -only GVHD must be confirmed by [CONTACT_9256].  Acute GVHD will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_512882]  (Appendix A) 57 and graded on BMT CTN MOP suggested grading 
sheets (Appendix A). Acute GVHD assessment and grading will be performed by [CONTACT_512883] . Chronic GVHD diagnosis and grading will be according to NIH Criteria. Please 
see Appendix B  58, 59. 
 
Clinical Grading of Chronic GVHD (According to Appendix B)  
None  
Version Date 03-13-18 Amendment  5 
43 
 Mild chronic GVHD involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung: see below ‡), 
with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum of score 1 in all affected 
organs or sites)  
Moderate chronic GVHD involves: (1) at least 1 organ or site with clinically significant 
but no major disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or site) or (2) 3 or more 
organs or s ites with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum score of 1 in 
all affected organs or sites). ‡A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate chronic 
GVHD.  
Severe chronic GVHD indicates major disability caused by [CONTACT_190963] (score o f 3 in 
any organ or site). ‡A lung score of 2 or greater will also be considered severe chronic 
GVHD.  
Presence of limited or extensive chronic GVHD will be also be recorded.  
 
Chimerism  Assessment  and Immune R econstitution : 
Chimerism will be evaluated using  sorted whole blood in CD3 and CD33 fractions. For the purpose 
of this protocol, mixed chimerism is defined as the presence of donor cells, as a proportion of total 
cells to be < 95% but > 5% in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Full donor chimerism is defined 
as ≥ 95% of donor cells. Mixed and full chimerism will be evidence of donor cell engraftment. Donor 
cells of ≤ 5% will be considered as graft rejection.  Similarly , platelet recovery  is defined as first 
day of platelet count  20,000 x 109/L, without transfusion for 7 consecutive days . Lineage 
specific chimerism analysi s (myeloid, T -cell [B -cell if available]  subsets ), quantitative 
immunoglobulins and immune reconstitution will be performed at baseline (if not performed as 
standard of care at or around day +30) and then on approximately days +90, +180 and +365.  
 
Secondary graft failure is defined as, ANC < 500 x 109/L after post -transplant neutrophil 
recovery in the absence of disease relapse/progression. Immunological graft rejection is 
defined as detecting <5% donor myeloid cells on chimerism analysis.

 8. Drug Formulation and Procurement  
 
MLN9708  (Ixazomib® Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. )  
Drug description  
MLN9708 is Millennium’s next generation small molecule inhibitor of the 20S 
proteasome that is under development for the treatment of nonhematologic 
malignancies, lymphoma, multiple myeloma (MM), and plasma cell dyscrasias. 
Inhibition of the 20S proteasome has been validated as a therapeutic target for the 
treatment of malignancies using VELCADE (bortezomib) for Injection, Millennium 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s first -in-class proteasome inhibitor . MLN2238 refers to the 
biologically active, boronic acid form of the drug substance, MLN9708. 
(Conversely, MLN9708 refer s to the citrate ester of MLN2238.) In water or aqueous 
systems, the equilibrium shifts from MLN9708 to the biologically active boronic 
acid form MLN2238.  
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamics  
The pharmacodynamic effect being evaluated in the development of MLN9708 is  
proteasome inhibition as measured by [CONTACT_512884] 20S proteasome activity, as well 
as elevation of the transcription factor ATF -3 in solid t umors (Study C16001) to 
explore target engagement.  Following a single dose of MLN9708, maximal 20S 
proteasome inhibit ion occurs at the first sampling time postdose (0.08 hr) with 
substantial return towards baseline by 4 hours for all dose groups except 2.34 mg/m2. 
Maximal 20S proteasome inhibition also occurs at the first sampling time postdose 
(0.08 hr) following the Da y 11 dose of MLN9708. There is substantial return 

Version Date 03-13-18 Amendment  5 
48 
 towards baseline by 2 hours for doses of 0.125 to 1.0 mg/m2 and by 96 hours for 
doses 1.33 to 2.34 mg/m2. 
 
Pharmacokinetics  
Clinical IV and PO pharmacokinetic (PK) data show that MLN9708 (measured as the 
biologically active boronic acid form of MLN9708 [MLN2238]) has multi -exponential 
disposition with a rapid initial phase that is largely over by [ADDRESS_663730] maximum plasma concentration (T max) of 
approximately 0.5 to 2.0 hours and terminal t 1/2 after multiple dosing of approximately 5 to 7 
days. Results of a population PK analysis (N = 137) show that there is no relationship 
between body surface area (BSA) or body weight and clearance (CL).  Also, bas ed on 
stochastic simulations for fixed dose, exposures are independent of the individual patient’s 
BSA.  Based on these data, a recommendation was made for fixed dosing in clinical trials.  
An absolute bioavailability of 67% was determined for MLN9708 usin g the population PK 
analysis.  
Metabolism appears to be the major route of elimination for MLN9708, with negligible 
urinary excretion of the parent drug (<  3% of dose).  In vitro studies of liver microsomes 
show that MLN9708 is metabolized by [CONTACT_20550] P450 enzymes (CYPs) and 
non-CYP enzymes/proteins.  The rank order of relative biotransformation activity of the 5 -
major human CYP isozymes is 3A4 (34.2%) >  1A2 (30.7%) > 2D6 (14.7%) >  2C9 (12.1%) 
> 2C19 (<  1%).  MLN9708 is not an inhibitor of CY Ps 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor is 
it a time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  The potential for MLN9708 treatment to 
produce DDIs via CYP inhibition is inferred to be low; however, there may be a potential 
for DDIs with a concomitant strong CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inhibitor because of the potential 
for first -pass metabolism when MLN9708 is administered via the PO route and because of 
the moderate contribution of CYP3A4 - and CYP1A2 -mediated metabolism of MLN9708 in 
human liver microsomes.  MLN9708 may be a wea k substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp), 
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance associated protein 
(MRP2) efflux pump transporters.  MLN9708 is not an inhibitor of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2.  
The potential for DDIs with substrates or inh ibitors of P -gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is, therefore, 
inferred to be low.

  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to any Component of this Medication  
Pregnancy  
Nursing Mothers  
 
 Concomitant Medications  
Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inhibitors is 
discouraged  during this study.  A drug-drug interaction (DDI)  with a strong inhibitor 
would increase MLN2238 exposure.  
• Strong inhibitors of CYP1A2:  fluvoxamine, enoxacin, cipro floxacin  
• Strong inhibitors of CYP3A:  clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, and posaconazole  
Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inducers should 
be avoided unless there is no appro priate alternative medication for the patient to 
use.  A DDI with a strong inducer would decrease MLN2238 exposure.  
• Strong CYP3A inducers:  rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
phenytoin, and phenobarbital  
• The dietary supplements St John’s wort  and Ginkgo biloba are not permitted.  
The following medications and procedures are permitted during the study:  
• Antiemetics, including 5 -HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists, may be used at 
the discretion of the investigator.  
• Loperamide or other antidiarrheal  should be used for symptomatic diarrhea at 
discretion of the investigator. The dose and regimen will be according to 
institutional guidelines. IVF should be given to prevent volume depletion.  
• Growth factors (eg, granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G -CSF], 
granulocyte macrophage -colony stimulating factor [GM -CSF], recombinant 
erythropoietin) are permitted. Their use should follow published guidelines 
and/or institutional practice. Erythropoietin will be allowed in this study. 
Their use should follow publ ished guidelines and/or institutional practice.

9. Statistical Considerations:  
 
The study is a multicenter  phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of MLN9708  
for the pro phylaxis of chronic  GVHD  in patients with hematological malignancies  and 
bone marrow failure syndromes  undergoing allogeneic HCT . The primary objective s of 
this study is to determine the MTD, DLT, RDP, and safety of MLN9708 as chronic 
GVHD prophylaxis in allogeneic HCT, as well a s to evaluate the [ADDRESS_663735] 3+3 design. MTD will 
be the dose level with ≤[ADDRESS_663736] will be eligible for phase I study.  
 
Due to the differences in the incidence rates of chronic GVHD after sibling and 
unrelated donor transplantation, this study will be designed to accrue these 2 cohorts 
separately but in parallel, with the null hypothesis of a rate of chronic GVHD at 1 -year 
of 55% after sibling transplantation and 65% after unrelated transplantation . The 
alternative hypothesis will be a 25% reduction with the use of new treatment in both 
cohorts. With this hypothesis, using an exact binomial distribution, the probability of 
Version Date 03-13-18 Amendment  5 
54 
 concluding the new treatment is promising, will be 0.80 (statistical power) when the true 
but unknown rate of developi[INVESTIGATOR_512864] 30% or 0.04 (type I error) when the 
true rate is 55% in related donor transplantation (Cohort A [matched sibling donor 
transplantation] with a sample size of 25).  Similarly, the probability of conclu ding the 
new treatment is promising, will be 0.81 (statistical power) when the true but unknown 
rate of developi[INVESTIGATOR_512864] 40% or 0.05 (type I error) when the true rate is 65% 
in unrelated transplantation (Cohort B [unrelated donor transplantation]  with a sample 
size of 26). The efficacy endpoint is chronic GVHD -free at [ADDRESS_663737] chronic GVHD, we will concl ude the new treatment is 
ineffective in Cohort A; for Cohort B, if [ADDRESS_663738] deviations, or medians with ranges, histograms 
and box -plot. The chronic GVHD rate at 1 -year and its 95%  CI will be calculated  by 
[CONTACT_512885], while accounting for competing events . Progression -free 
survival and overall survival will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. 
Cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, disease relapse and non -relapse 
mortality will be calculated by [CONTACT_512886]. Competing events for 
acute GVH D disease are relapse or death without acute GVHD, while those for chronic 
GVHD are relapse or death without chronic GVHD. Disease relapse and non -relapse 
mortality are competing events for each other. Toxicity will be reported by [CONTACT_24975], 
frequency and sever ity. Worst toxicity grades per patient will be tabulated for selected 
adverse events and laboratory measurements.  Patients replaced on the protocol (as 
specified in the Dose Modification Section) will remain evaluable for safety and toxicity 
assessment.  
 
Safety/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  
For the phase II portion of the study we propose to accrue 51 patients over 24 –[ADDRESS_663739] -transplant immunologic graft 
rejection (defined as less than 5% donor myeloid cells) rate is approximately 2. 5% (in 
absence of relapsed disease)  and the enrollment will be put on hold if more than 5% 
graft rejection rate is seen. For the development of grade 3 -4 adverse events  deemed to 
be related to MLN9708 , the true rate is 5% and enrollment will be on hold if more than 
10% adverse events are observed. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_512865] 3 -4 adv erse events are shown in Table below . In the case of a 
safety event suspending study, a prompt cumulative examination of all data and 
circumstances of these events will be conducted by [CONTACT_512887] e whether study should be resumed, whether the protocol will be 
revised or whether the study will be discontinued permanently.

 10.  Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
 
11. Definitions  
 
The following are definitions of adverse events as defined by 21CFR312.32.  
 
Types of Adverse  Events  
 
Adverse Event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not consider drug related.  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symp tom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether 
or not it is related to the medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a 
previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency  since the administration of 
study drug.  
 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discont inuation or delay in treatment , therapeutic intervention, or is considered by [CONTACT_149630] a clinically signifi cant change from baseline.  
 
Life-threatening adverse event or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction:   An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrenc e places the patient or subject at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reactio n:  An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death,  
• Is life -threatening  (as defined above),  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] , 
Version Date 03-13-18 Amendment  5 
57 
 • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be l ife-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent of the outcomes listed above.   
Susp ected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  S uspected 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, 
which means  any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction:  An adverse event 
or suspected adverse  reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, it is not consistent with the risk 
information currently described.   
 
Unexpected also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned 
in the investigator brochure as occurring  with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug,  but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with 
the particular drug under investigation.  
 
Adverse Event of Special Interest Definition : Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
are a subset of AEs that are to be reported to Millennium on a quarterly basis by [CONTACT_103] -investigator. Millennium will provide the current list of AESIs and updates to the 
list will be distributed to the sponsor -investigator as appropriate .

Reporting of Adverse Events  
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures.  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical 
finding is considered an AE.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  For serious AEs, the 
Version Date 03-13-[ADDRESS_663740] be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) 
from the date the participant signs Informed Consent through [ADDRESS_663741] 9708. Any SAE that occurs at any time  after completion of MLN9708 
treatment or after the designated follow -up period that the sponsor -investigator and/or sub -
investigator considers to be related to any study drug must be reported to Millennium 
Pharmacovigi lance (or designee).  In addition, new primary malignancies that occur during 
the follow -up periods must be reported, regardless of causality to study regimen, for a 
minimum of three years after the last dose of the investigational product, starting from t he 
first dose of study drug. All new cases of primary malignancy must be reported to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee).     
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512868] (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or 
later than planned).  All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly 
determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mehdi Hamadani , 
also referred to as the sponsor -investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse 
events (SAEs) to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor - investigator’s EC or IRB.   
Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SAEs (including serious pretrea tment events) 
must also be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance : 
Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 hours but no later than 4 calendar days of the 
sponsor -investigator’s observation or awareness of the event  
 
All other serious (non -fatal/non -life threatening) events within 4 calendar days of the 
sponsor -investigator’s observation or awareness of the event  
  See below for contact [CONTACT_128750].   
The sponsor -investigator must  fax the SAE Form  per the timelines above .  A sample of an 
SAE Form is provided  (See Appendix C) .

• Event term(s)  
• Serious criteria  
• Intensity of the event(s):  Sponsor -investigator’s or sub -investigator’s 
determination.   Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will 
be determined by [CONTACT_128751], as a 
guideline, whenever possible.   The criteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
• Causality of the event(s): Sponsor -investigator’s or sub -investigator’s 
determination of the relationship of the event(s) to study drug administration.  
Follow -up information on the SAE may be requested by [CONTACT_20555].  The SAE report must 
include event term(s), serious criteria, and the sponsor -investigator’s or sub -investigator’s 
determination of both the intensity of the event(s) and the relationship of the event(s) to 
study drug administration.  Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be 
determined by [CONTACT_91853], as a guideline, 
whenever possible.  The criteria are available online at

Because all of  the study transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_255177], significant r egimen related toxicity is expected.  These risks are listed in the 
transplant consent form.  A study specific toxicity CRF will be designed to capture 
information regarding these expected events.  Transplant is also related to a degree of 
mortality and th is will also be captured by a study designed CRF.  Unexpected adverse 
events will be reported throughout the study.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Events  
All unexpected grade 3, and all grade 4, and 5 adverse events, as well as any others 
requiring expedited reportin g as defined in this protocol , will be reported to the MCW 
Cancer Center DSMC. (Grades 4 & [ADDRESS_663744] be reported to the DSMC within 5 
calendar d ays of study staff’s knowledge) .  If the Grade 3 -5 event is determined to be an 
unanticipated problem,  the e vent will be forwarded to the MCW  IRB for review as required 
by [CONTACT_255188].   Unexpected adverse events, regardless of severity, will be reported to the 
MCW Cancer Center DSMC  and reviewed on a quarterly basis.  
 
Expected Adverse Events  
Expected adverse events that are being captured on the study toxicity form will be reported 
at the time of the form’s scheduled due date.

 Procedures for Reporting AESIs  
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures.  Any clinically relevant deterioration in lab oratory assessments or other clinical 
finding is considered an AE.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  For non -serious AEs 
(including AESIs), the investigator must determi ne both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
AESIs must be reported to Millennium on a quarterly basis.  
 
Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure during Pregnancy and Birth Events  
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this 
study, she must inform the investigator immediately and permanently discontinue study 
drug.  The sponsor -investigator must immediately fax a completed Pregnancy Form to the 
Millennium De partment of Pharmacovigilance or designee (see Section Reporting of 
Adverse Events).  The pregnancy must be followed for the final pregnancy outcome.  
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s 
participation in this stu dy, the sponsor -investigator must also immediately fax a completed 
Pregnancy Form to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (see 
Section Reporting of Adverse Events).  Every effort should be made to follow the pregnancy 
for the final pr egnancy outcome.

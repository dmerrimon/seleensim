Assessments  Efficacy: spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], QOL -PCD, SGRQ  
Safety : AEs, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], clinical laboratory values (urine, serum and plasma 
chemistry, and hematology) , ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry  
  
 
 
  
Statistical Analyses  Statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistica l analysis plan (SAP) , 
which will be finalized before the clinical database lock for the study.   
Part A  
The primary efficacy objective of Part A is to evaluate the efficacy of VX -371 
with and without HS in subjects ≥12 years of age with PCD. For the Part A 
efficacy analysis, statistical inferences will be based on change from study 
baseline, and formal comparisons will be made between groups. The null 
hypotheses to be tested in Part A are that the absolute absolute  change from study 
baseline in ppFEV 1 after 28 days of treatment is the same for 1) VX -371 in HS 
versus placebo ; 2) VX -371 versus placebo; and 3) VX -[ADDRESS_104229] 
approximately 81% power to detect a 3 -percentage point treatment difference in 
the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from study baseline, after 28 days of 
treatme nt between VX -371 + HS and HS alone. Part A of the study will have 
approximately 87% power to detect a 4 -percentage point change from baseline, 
after 28 days of treatment in ppFEV 1 between VX -371 + HS and placebo. The 
power to detect a 3  percentage point  difference between VX -371 and placebo is 
about 51%. The sample size estimate was based on [ADDRESS_104230] w as assumed to be 0. 
Furthermore, a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 was used in the sample size 
determination with no multiplicity adjustment . The sample size also takes into 
consideration an assumed dropout rate of 10%.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV [ADDRESS_104231] 
the compound symmetry (CS) structure. Denominator degrees of freedom for the 
F-test for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward -Roger approximation.  
The estimated mean of the dependent variable, a 95% confidence interval  (CI), 
and a [ADDRESS_104232] icity. Similarly, the estimated between -treatment 
differences along with the corresponding 95% CI and 2 -sided P values will be 
presented.

baseline and Part B baseline, after 28 days of treatment, descriptive summary 
statistics (n, mean, SD, SE, median, minimum, and maximum),  and within -group 
comparisons will be made.  
The within -group P value and the 95% CI based on normal approximation will be 
provided for absolute chang e in ppFEV 1:  
 From study baseline, after 28 days of treatment in Part B  
 From Part B baseline, after 28 days of treatment in Part B

 INTRODUCTION  
 Background  
Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by [CONTACT_94261]. In the ciliated airways of the lung, PCD is manifested by [CONTACT_94262], including bacteria. Clinical features of PCD include early onset of recurrent or persistent rhinitis, sinusitis, otitis media, bronchiectasis and bronchial infections.
1 
About 50% of PCD patients have situs inversus or other laterality defects. Infertility occurs in nearly 100% of males due to immotile spermatozoa and females are often infertile due to impaired ciliary function in the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134].
[ADDRESS_104251] very low nasal nitric oxide (nNO) concentrations, ranging from 1/10th to 1/50th that 
of healthy subjects.3,[ADDRESS_104252] percussion, postural drainage, drugs to treat pulmonary symptoms and antibiotics (often oral). Given the importance of cough clearance in patients with PCD, the use of cough suppressants is avoided. 
It has been classically believed that mucus clearance is affected by [CONTACT_94263] (i.e., mucociliary clearance; MCC) and cough (i.e., cough dependent clearance). Because of the absence of cilial activity in PCD, it has been concluded that PCD reflects a simple loss of mechanical transduction of cilial force into mucus transport. This scenario is consistent with the gravitational distribution of PCD bronchiectasis, i.e., it is more prevalent in lower lobes. 
However, it has been demonstrated that mucus clearance is more complicated than simply a 
combination of MCC and cough 
clearance and that mucus concentration is a major determinant 
of mucus transport. As a component of studies designed to explore how normal airways mainta in 
mucus hydration (2% solids, 98% water) optimal for mucus transport, it was discovered that 
motile cilia sense the hydration status of mucus (see  Figure 5-1 ).13

Parion Sciences Incorporated  Figure 5-1 Proposed Feedback Model for PCL Hydration  
  
Proposed feedback model of stimulation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release and subsequent fluid secretion 
by [CONTACT_94264]. Increased mucus 
concentration is sensed by [CONTACT_94265]. Once the 
mucus is rehydrated and has a lower viscoelasticity, the stress on the cilia is reduced, ATP release is decreased, 
and fluid homeo stasis returns to the normal state (from Button 2013)13. 
The mechanism for the normal autoregulation of mucus hydration requires two elements: 1) 
strain on the cilial shaft, which is dependent on the interaction of a beating cilium and the concentration of mucus (i.e., a more concentrated mucus is more difficult to move) and which puts more strain on the cilial shaft/base; and 2) cilial strain-dependent release of ATP into the airway lumen, whereby [CONTACT_94266][INVESTIGATOR_85062] (ENaC)-dependent sodium (Na
+) (and fluid) absorption and accelerates cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane receptor (CFTR)- and calcium (Ca++)-activated chloride (Cl-) channel-dependent 
fluid secretion. Thus, in PCD, the abnormally high rate of Na+ absorption and low rate of Cl- 
secretion that produces mucus hyperconcentration reflect the absence of normal regulation by [CONTACT_94267]. Representative data showing the dependence of airway surface liquid (ASL) hydration on ATP concentrations and the dependence of ATP 
concentrations on motile cilia are shown in Figure 5-2.

(A) Relationship between the magnitude of changes in luminal ATP concentrations and ASL height. Human 
airway cultures were subjected to varying degrees of oscillatory stress before measuring luminal [ATP] and 
steady -state ASL height. These data revealed a direct relationship between ATP and changes in ASL height.

concentration of luminal ATP and the concentration of LMA added to the airway sur face. Means ± SE from 
6 to 8 cultures per point. * P <0.05 compared to vehicle (0% LMA). ( D) Relationship between the change in 
ASL height and concentration of LMA for both poorly ciliated and well -ciliated cultures. Data are plotted as 
the difference in AS L height between the LMA relative and a vehicle control (PBS) at 30 min after exposure. 
Without LMA, (PBS control), the average ASL height at 30 min was 8.2 ± 0.3 μm for the well -ciliated and 
6.1 ± 0.4 μm for the poorly ciliated group. Mean ± SE from 3 cul tures per point. * P <0.05 compared to the 
initial measurement (from Button 2013).  
As part of these studies, the question was asked whether the autoregulation of mucus/ASL 
hydration depended on motile cilia. Indeed, both an agent that acutely paralyzed cilial activity (isoflurane) and ciliated cultures from subjects with PCD revealed that motile cilia were required for this sensing mechanism ( Figure 5-3
). This observation led to the hypothesis that there may be 
a “second hit” in PCD mucus clearance, i.e., mucus hyperconcentration. Review of the literature revealed that PCD mucus was hyperconcentrated (dehydrated) to a degree similar to cystic fibrosis (CF).

Data summarizing the role of cilia beating in control, isoflur ane-treated (ISO), and primary ciliary dyskinesia 
(PCD) airway cultures exposed to 0.15% LMA and 0.3% LMA. Data are means ± SE from three cultures per 
group. * P <0.05 between groups (from Button 2013) . 
The poor clearance of PCD mucus as a function of increased concentration may not appear to be 
relevant to PCD subjects who have no cilial activity (i.e., no MCC). However, recent analyses suggest that mucus hyperconcentration is a major factor in the clearance of mucus by [CONTACT_94268]. For example, simple measures of cough clearance suggest that cough clearance is decreased as a function of the mucus concentration cubed.
16 Similarly, the 
disadhesion of mucus from the epi[INVESTIGATOR_94223] “tearing” of mucus from adjacent mucus (i.e., mucus 
cohesion).17,[ADDRESS_104253] mode of mucus clearance i.e., gas-liquid pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 19,20,21 Though 
described 30 years ago, little attention has been paid to this mode of transport. In essence, this 
transport reflects 3 variables: 1) there is hysteresis in shear on airway surfaces during normal respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], so that shear is greatest on expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]; 2) entrainment of mucus flow by [CONTACT_94269]; and 3) the friction generated by [CONTACT_94270]. Recent in vivo data support this mechanism in animals. Importantly, recent data have shown that the friction of mucus movement over airway surfaces is again highly dependent on mucus concentration, i.e., the higher the concentration, the higher the friction. Recent studies of mouse models of PCD suggest that gas-
liquid pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_94224]. Therefore, it predicted that 
agents that normalize mucus concentration in PCD subjects, i.e., hydrating agents, will reduce mucus-airways surface friction and accelerate gas-liquid dependent mucus clearance.  
In summary, it appears likely that the failure to clear mucus in PCD subjects reflects both the absence of cilial beat/force and the absence of normal regulation of mucus concentration. Mucus hyperconcentration is predicted to limit the effectiveness of the 2 “backup” mechanisms for mucus clearance in PCD subjects, i.e., cough and gas-liquid pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Consequently, restoring PCD mucus to its normal hydration status is predicted to be therapeutic in this population.

located at the basolateral membrane. In the lungs, ENaC is one of the primary proteins that control the ASL volume and is therefore linked to airway hydration and mucus clearance. Optimal MCC requires that airway secretions be adequately hydrated. ENaC is activated by [CONTACT_94271], which can be due to constitutive proteases such as prostasin or by [CONTACT_94272]. It is hypothesized that the inhibition of ENaC activity with VX-[ADDRESS_104255] secretions rendering them more 
susceptible to cough clearance and gas-liquid pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_94226].

 Ivacaftor  
Ivacaftor (Kalydeco®) is an orally administered CFTR potentiator that increases the 
channel-open probability of CFTR protein to enhance chloride transport, which yields clinical 
benefit in certain patients with CF.  
Kalydeco is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients as young as [ADDRESS_104256] the 
G551D  and certain ot
her gating mutations as well the R117H  mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator gene  (CFTR) .  The indicated mutations and approved 
populations vary by [CONTACT_1606]. 
Additional information about ivacaftor is available in the Ivacaftor Investigator’s Brochure. 
 Rationale for the Present Study  
In PCD, the lack of ATP release into the lumen of the airways due to dysfunctional cilia leaves 
ENaC uninhibit
ed, resulting in hyperconcentration of mucus. Inhibition of ENaC by [CONTACT_94273]-[ADDRESS_104257] luminal ATP. Ivacaftor 
improves chloride transport in vitro in normal human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells that have intact CFTR, and in HBE cells from CF patients with various CFTR  mutations, yielding 
increased ASL height.

8.1.[ADDRESS_104263] clearance measures/techniques should be kept on a stable regimen for the  du
ration of the study, other than the discontinuation of use of HS during 
the Screening Period. 
If taking daily chronic or chronic cycling antibiotics, the subject must have been on a consistent 
regimen for at l
east 4 months before the Screening Visit. The cycling regimen of antibiotics can 
be either intermittent monotherapy (e.g., 28 days on/28 days off) or continuous alternating 
therapy (e.g., 28-day cycles of 2 alternating antibiotics). For patients that take cycling antibiotics, 
with only [ADDRESS_104264]’s antibiotic cycle (e.g., if Day 1 falls on the 4 th 
day of a cycle, Day 57 should fall on the 4 th day of the same antibiotic cycle). For patients that 
take cycling, alternating antibiotics, the first day of Treatment Period [ADDRESS_104265]’s antibiotic cycle with the same drug (e.g., if Day 1 falls on the 4 th day of a cycle with antibiotic #1, Day 57 should also fall on the 4 th 
day of the cycle with antibiotic #1). Subjects who are on a stable chronic antibiotic regimen should remain on this regimen through completion of the last study visit. 
8.1.2  Screening: Da y

for the study. The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain informed consent and assent (where applicable) from each subject. To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the study requirements for concomitant medications (Table 9-1 and Table 9-2 ). 
At the Screening Visit, each subject will receive a test dose of 4.2% HS via a PARI eFlow nebulizer to confirm toler
ability of inhaled HS. Pre-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_94227] [ADDRESS_104267]-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_10239] 60 (± 5) minutes after the test dose. If the subject’s post- HS test dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_94228] a 15-percentage point or

subject’s pre-HS test dose ppFEV [ADDRESS_104270]’s ppFEV 1 returns to within 15 percentage points (absolute) of the pre-HS test dose 
value, the investigator may provide a short-acting bronchodilator for use before all doses of inhaled study drug are administered.  
If the subject experiences a post-HS test dose absolute decline in ppFEV
[ADDRESS_104271] meet the confirmatory diagnostic PCD criteria (including central review, as required) prior 
to randomization ( Section 9.1). 
Screen failures and reason for failure will be documented within the eCRF.

Parion Sciences Incorporated  [IP_ADDRESS]  Planned Pre-visit Subject Contacts 
There are [ADDRESS_104287] during the study; 4 will occur in Part A and 
1 will occur in Part B.  
These contacts are to occur:  
 Part A: 1 day before the Day 1, Day 29, Day 57, and Day 85 Visits 
 Part B: [ADDRESS_104288], which may occur via telephone call, text message, or email, is 
designed to ensure:
 
 that subjects remember to withhold their morning dose of study drug in Part A before the 
Day 29 and Day
 85 Visit and in Part B before the Day 113 Visit only if the clinic visit is 
scheduled within 4 hours after the time of the morning dose,    
 that subj ects withhold their short-acting bronchodilator for 4 hours before spi[INVESTIGATOR_94234] d at t
he clinic in Part A at the Day 1, Day 29, Day 57, and Day 85 Visits, and in Part 
B before the Day 113 Visit,    
 that subjects withhold long-acting bronchodilators the night before the first and last visit of 
each trea
tment period 
  
 that subje
cts remember to bring their subject diary, all unused study drug, and  
 back to t
he clinic in Part A at the Day [ADDRESS_104289]’s last study visit and all study procedures, the pre-study 
medication
 regimen may be resumed at the discretion of the investigator.  
8.1.4  Follow- Up 
The Safet
y Follow-up Telephone Call is scheduled to occur 28 days (± 7 days) after the last dose 
of study drug for subj
ects who complete study drug dosing and for subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study drug dosing.  
Based on a clinical finding during either Treatment Period or during the 28-day Safety Follow-up 
Period, the investig
ator may decide to convert the Safety Follow-up Telephone Call into a Safety 
Follow-up Visit, whereby [CONTACT_94275].  
8.1.[ADDRESS_104290] decides to terminate study drug treatment. Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Telephone Call, approximately 28 days (± 7 days) after their last dose of study drug.  
Report P155, Version 1.[ADDRESS_104291] regular, planned reviews of 
study data with the prima
ry goal of evaluating the safety of the study drug regimen to ensure the 
subjects’ safety (Section 12.3.5). Procedural details of the IDMC’s structure and fun ction, 
frequen
cy of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC charter. The 
IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened.  
 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
8.2.1  Study Design  
Part A of this Phase 2a, 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete block, 
multicenter crossove
r study, in subjects with PCD ≥12 years of age is designed to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of VX-371 formulated with or without HS. In Part B (optional), the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor and VX-[ADDRESS_104292] enrollment to only those subjects who meet the rigorous entry criteria.   
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design was selected for Part A to avoid 
observer bias and r e
duce symptoms or outcomes arising from the investigator’s or the subject’s 
knowledge of treatment. An incomplete block crossover design wherein subjects are randomized 
to 1 of 4 treatment sequences ( Table 8-1) will enable within-subject comparison of the treatment 
effects with incre
ased statistical power while maximizing the power for the comparisons 
anticipated to be of greatest interest. In Part B, administration of ivacaftor will be open-label, but subjects will remain blinded to the inhaled study drug treatment regimen and sequence.  
During Part A, a 28-day Washout Period is judged to be of sufficient duration for all subjects to 
return to their base li 
ne values for FEV 1. Multiple comparisons will be made which will provide 
insight with respect to the effect of VX-[ADDRESS_104293] to both 0.17% saline (placebo) and 4.2% HS since each subject will receive treatment with only 1 saline concentration; no subject will cross over from 0.17% saline to 4.2% HS or 
vice versa. The double blind will also be maintained with regard to VX-[ADDRESS_104294] been made

Parion Sciences Incorporated  regarding the chosen endpoints from CF studies and applied to this PCD study. Change in 
ppFEV 1 was selected as the primary assessment of efficacy, based on observed effects of 
hydrating agents in CF, and based on observations that oral antibiotics can increase ppFEV 1 in 
treated PCD patients, which indicates that FEV 1 may be an acceptable measure. In addition, 2 
quality of life instruments (i.e., questionnaires), the QOL-PCD and SGRQ, will be used.  
  
While chronic cycling antibiotics are not widely used in PCD patients, the scheduling of study drug with regard to the a
ntibiotic schedule should be controlled while the subject is enrolled in 
the study as antibiotics may affect spi[INVESTIGATOR_94235] (Section 8.1.1). 
A sample size of approximately [ADDRESS_104295] on the 
efficac y
 of inhaled VX-371. Therefore, no Washout Period between Treatment Period 2 and 
Treatment Period 3 is necessary.  
8.2.2  Study Drug Dose a nd Duration 
 
 
 Thus, Pa
rt A of the current study is designed to 
demonstrate safety and efficacy of an 85 µg dose of VX-371 administered twice daily, with or 
without HS, by [CONTACT_94276].  
Parion Sciences Study PS-G201 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-
group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 85 µg VX-371 twice daily in subjects 
with CF.  
 
 
In Part B, subjects will continue on their inhaled study drug regimen from Treatment Period 2, 
and will also rec e
ive 150 mg of ivacaftor every 12 hours (q12h) for 28 days through Day 113 
(see the Ivacaftor Investigator’s Brochure for additional details supporting the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile of ivacaftor).  
8.2.3  Rationale for Study
  Assessments 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (as measured by [CONTACT_10266] 1) is the most widely implemented standardized 
assessment to evaluate lung function.[ADDRESS_104296] clinically accepted measure of disease progression in CF, indicates that FEV
1 may be an equally acceptable measure in efficacy studies of the PCD 
population.  
QOL -PCD:  The QOL-PCD is a subject-completed, disease-specific instrument designed to 
measure impact on overall health, daily life, perceived well-being and symptoms that has been 
developed specifically for use in subjects with a diagnosis of PCD.25,26  
SGRQ:  The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire with 76 weighted responses. This questionnaire 
measures health status (quality of life) in patients with diseases of airway obstruction.27 It has 
good discriminative and evaluative properties and is responsive to therapeutic trials.

Parion Sciences Incorporated  The items in the SGRQ are divided into 3 domains: “Symptoms,” which is concerned with 
frequency and severity of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]; “Activity,” which is concerned with activities that cause or are limited by [CONTACT_94277]; and “Impacts,” which covers aspects concerned with social functioning and psychological troubles resulting from airway disease. A score will be calculated for each domain and a total score will also be calculated. For each domain and for the total score, the range of values is 0 to 100, with higher values corresponding with greate r 
impairment of quality of life. A minimum change in score of 4 units was established as clinically relevant after patient and clinician testing.

 STUDY DRUG ADMINISTR ATION AND MANAGEMENT  
 Preparation and Dispensing  
Study drug may be dispensed only under the supervision of the investigator or an authorized designee and only for administrati
on to the study subjects. 
 Administration  
10.2.[ADDRESS_104316].  
Subjects will be given instruction by [CONTACT_94281], 
and will also rec
eive written instructions on the care, use, and cleaning requirements. The 
nebulizer device (nebulizer and handset/aerosol head) identification information will be documented for each subject. 
Subjects are required to use the correctly assembled device, into which inhaled study drug has 
been adde
d, and to nebulize through oral inhalation sitting up, with the device held horizontally 
and breathing more deeply than normal tidal breathing. This should be continued until all study drug has been delivered.  
A replacement nebulizer and/or handset (aerosol head) may be provided at other times during the 
study, if nec e 
ssary.

10.2.5  Missed Dose s 
On Non-Clinic Visit Days: 
 If a subject misses a dose of study drug (inhaled study drug and/or oral ivacaftor) and 
remembers the missed dose within [ADDRESS_104323] should take the dose of study drug 
(with a fat-containing food, if oral ivacaftor). 
 If more than [ADDRESS_104324] should skip that 
dose of study drug
 and resume the normal schedule for the following dose. A double dose 
should not be taken to make up for the forgotten dose. 
On Clinic Visit Days: 
 If a subject misses a dose of study drug (inhaled study drug and/or oral ivacaftor) on a Study Visit day, the subject should take the dose (with a fat-containing food, if ivacaftor), unless it 
is within [ADDRESS_104325] me
t all eligibility criteria. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio in 
Part A to one of the 4 treatment sequences, (Treatment Sequence 1 or Treatment Sequence 2; Treatment Sequence 3 or Treatment Sequence 4), stratifying for ppFEV
1 severity (<70 or ≥70).  
Report P155, Version 1.[ADDRESS_104326] dose of inhaled study drug is administered in Part A on Day 1.  
An interactive web or voice response system (IXRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. 
The randomization code will be produced by a quali
fied randomization vendor. The Parion 
Sciences study biostatistician, or designee, will review and approve the dummy randomization list. The final randomization list will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded biostatistician.  
There is no randomization in Part B. Subjects will remain in the same treatment as in Treatment 
Period [ADDRESS_104327] be able to meet 
and comply with study drug restrictions for Part B as outlined in Table 9-1 and  Table 9-2 an d per 
the Study Reference Manual.  
 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
Modifications of the study drug doses are prohibited. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will be withdrawn from the study and study drug dosing will
 be discontinued. 
Interruptions of study drug dosing may be considered on a case- by-case basis after discussion 
with the Parion medical monitor.  
Specific instructions for interruption for elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and elevated plasma 
and serum potassium are provided in Section 11.6.2 . 
 Packaging and Lab eling  
Inhaled study drug (85 µg VX-371 in 4.2% HS; 4.2% HS; 85 µg VX-371 in 0.17% saline; and placebo [0.17% saline]) will be supplied in blow-fill seal via

 Disposal , Return, or Retention of Unused Drug  
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by [CONTACT_94286]. At the end of the study, the study monitor 
will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. If the study monitor authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by [CONTACT_94284]. Destruction will be adequately documented. Procedures for destruction or return of the study drug will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
 Compliance  
To maximize treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug 
dosing that occurs at t
he site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is 
compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements.  
Compliance will also be assessed by [CONTACT_94287].  
Discrepa n
cies will be discussed with the subject. If subjects demonstrate continued 
noncompliance of study 
drug dosing despi[INVESTIGATOR_693], the investigator will contact [CONTACT_94288].

10.10.[ADDRESS_104329]’s treatment by [CONTACT_94289]’s study drug is 
necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact [CONTACT_94290]. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, 
they should first attempt to contact [CONTACT_94291]. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the Parion medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and 
may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation 
with the Parion medical monitor. 
Contact [CONTACT_94292] (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a separat e
 document. 
If a subject’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical si tuation, t 
he Parion medical monitor will be notified within [ADDRESS_104330]’s 
study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with Parion Sciences, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject).  In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted 
unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS and Parion Sciences or designee, per Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Parion Sciences or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In addition, Parion Sciences may, for matters relating to saf
ety concerns, 
unblind individual subjects at any time.  
 ASSESSM ENTS  
 Timing of Assessments  
The schedule of assessments is shown in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3.  
The QOL-PCD assessment must be completed before the start of any other assessments. The SGRQ should be completed immediately following the QOL-PCD.  
 
 
 
Subjects who ha
ve taken their morning dose of study drug may have a study visit and undergo 
visit assessments on that day, provided that the pre-dose assessments do not occur within [ADDRESS_104331] and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, 
weight, nNO level, type of laterality defect (situs inversus  tot 
alis, situs ambiguous, or heterotaxy) 
confirmed by [CONTACT_94293] (if applicable), and PCD genetic mutation (determined by [CONTACT_94294]). PCD diagnostic criteria listed in Section 9.1 will be reviewed centrally, as defined in the Study Reference Ma
nual.

PCD Genotype: PCD genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_94247].  
Specific instructions will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. Unless a confirmed PCD genotype is an inclusion criterion for a particular subject, the genotype result is not required in order for randomization to occur. If a confirmed PCD genotype is required for randomization, enough time should be given between collection of the sample and the Day 1 Visit to allow results to be received.   
Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other

For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of 
urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_94295].

e. Subjects discontinued for elevated ALT or AST levels 
should be followed until their levels normalize or return to baseline. 
If a convincing alternative etiology is identified for the ALT and/or AST elevation, study drug 
may be resumed when both 
laboratory values return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is 
higher, after approval by [CONTACT_94296].  
Upon resumption of study drug, ALT and/or AST must be assessed weekly for the shorter of: 
 4 weeks 
 [ADDRESS_104340] dose of stud
y drug, if ALT and/or AST levels have returned to 
baseline or ≤2 × UL N
 
Upon resumption of study drug, ALT and/or ALT levels must be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If 
a repeat elevati
on of >5 × ULN occurs within [ADDRESS_104341] be discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 
11.6.3  Physical Ex aminations and Vital Signs 
A complete physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit, Day 1, Day 29, Day 
57, Day 85, Day 113, and ETT
 visits. At the Day 15, Day 71 and Day 99 visits (if completed), an 
abbreviated physical examination will be done. The complete physical examination will include the following components: HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat), neck, chest and chest 
auscultation, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, and musculoskeletal. The abbreviated physical 
examination will include the following components: HEENT, neck, chest auscultation, cardiovascular, and skin. Both the full and abbreviated physical examinations will exclude rectal and genitourinary examinations (see  Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3 ). 
After the Screening Visit, any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examinations will be reported as AEs. 
Vital si g
ns include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), body temperature, pulse rate (beats per 
minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 
(breaths per minute), and pulse oximetry. These will be assessed 
Report P155, Version 1.[ADDRESS_104342] in a sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. After the Screening Visit, 
clinically significant abnormal findings in vital signs will be reported as AEs.  
11.6.4  Electrocardiograms  
Twelve-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 3-1 , Ta
ble 3-2, and Table 3-3 ). Additional 12-lead ECGs will be performed 
at any other time if cli
nically indicated. The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the 
following guidelines: 
 The subject will be instructed to rest in a sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes 
before having
 an ECG performed. 
 Prior to placing ECG leads, the record will be reviewed for the presence of dextrocardia. 
Subjects with dextroca
rdia will have all ECG limb and chest (V) leads reversed. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening Visit, Day 1, Day 15 (if a 
visit is conduc ted), Day 
29, Day 57, Day 71 (if a visit is conducted), Day 85, Day 99 (if a visit is 
conducted), Day 113, and the ETT Visit. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_94297]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities (taking into consideration anticipated abnormalities in subjects with dextrocardia) occurring during the study through the Day 113 Visit will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measure
ments. If the QTcF increases by >45 msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥[ADDRESS_104343] in reproductive toxicology studies, including rat fertility, rat 
and rabbit embryo-

 Result
s suggested that the clinical effects of the oral contraceptive would 
not likely be adversely impacted by [CONTACT_94298]. Therefore, hormonal contraceptives are one acceptable means of contraception for female subjects of childbearing potential in this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Contraception 
P
articipation in this study requires a commitment from the subject and his/her partner to use at 
least [ADDRESS_104344] dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until [ADDRESS_104345] dose of study drug. 
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
 True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Pe
riodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
 If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through exami
nation of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_94299]. 
 If the female is of non-childbearing potential, per the following: 
o Documente d h
ysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy. 
o Postme
nopausal: continuous amenorrhea for at least 12 months and serum FSH levels 
≥40 mIU/mL
.  
o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). If a female achieves 
menarche
 during the study, she will need to follow acceptable methods of contraception 
or abstinence.  
For subjects for whom contraception methods are not waived due to one of the reasons cited above
, the following are acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects and their 
female (non-study) partners, and for female subjects and their male (non-study) partners:  
Table 11-2 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  
 Male vasectomy [ADDRESS_104346] -vasectomy semen analysis for sperm.  
 Male or female condom with or without spermicide (either as a single product if commercially available and/or 
allowed  according to local regulations; otherwise condom and spermicide as separate products).  
 Female bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6 months previously.  
 Female diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal sponge, each with spermicide (where available).  
 Femal e continuous use of an intrauterine device (non -hormone releasing or hormone releasing) for at least 90 
days.  
 Female combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation if succes sfully used for at least 60  days.  
 
Important notes: 
 Local requirements may prohibit the use of some of these acceptable methods listed above. 
Please c
ontact the Parion medical monitor with any questions. 
 If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or 
requirements. 
 Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to follow the contrac
eptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active.

12.3.4
.1 Advers e Events 
For analysis purposes, AEs will be classified as pre-treatment AEs or TEAEs, defined as follows:  
Pre-treatment AEs: Any AEs that st arted before the initial dosing of study drug. 
TEAE: any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed during the treatment 
emergent pe
riod for Part A Treatment Period 1 or Part A Treatment Period 2 or Part B. An AE 
that starts (or increases in severity) during a specific Part A Treatment Period or Part B will be attributed to the study drug the subject was receiving during the corresponding Part A Treatment Period or Part B.  
For AEs with missing or partial start date, if there is no clear evidence that the AEs started (or 
increas e
d in severity) before the first dose of Part A, the start date will be imputed to the first 
dosing date of Part A and the AE assigned to the treatment in Part A Treatment Period 1. For AEs with missing or partial start date, if there is no clear evidence that the AEs started (or increased in severity) before the first dose of Part B, the start date will be imputed to the first dosing date of Part B and the AE assigned to the treatment in Part A Treatment Period 1. Therefore, for AEs with missing or partial start date, it is possible the AE is considered treatment-emergent in both Part A Treatment Period 1 and Part B. 
Part A and Part B 
AE summary tables for Part A will be presented for TEAEs only and will include the following:

CONSIDERATIONS  
 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse
  Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adve rse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necess
arily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a preexisting condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed and study procedures have started.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically  S
 ignificant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, physical exams, pulse oximetry, and vital 
signs, will be assessed a
nd those deemed a clinically significant worsening from baseline 
documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of 
the following: 
 C
oncomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
 Further di a
gnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
 Discontinuati
on from the study 
Repeat t
esting to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not
 necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].

All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed and study procedures have started until the 
following time points: 
 For subje
cts who are not randomized until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, 
withdrawal of conse
nt) 
 For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Telephone Call: through the Safety 
Follow-up Te
lephone Call 
 For subjects who Early Terminate from the study: through the Safety Follow-up Telephone Call 
All subjec
ts will be queried, using non-leading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. Whe
n possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_104373]’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: 
 Description of the event 
 Classifica ti
on of “serious” or “nonserious” 
 Date of first o
ccurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
 Severit

guidance av
ailable at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed August 
2012). AEs of CTCAE Grade 
s 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” In considering 
the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1.

lity will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. 
Table 13-[ADDRESS_104375] been ruled out, 
and/or the event re -appeared on re -exposure to the invest igational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be a lternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational stud y drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject’s medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken 
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified acc
ording to the categories shown in Table 13-3.

Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE bega n and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.

Parion Sciences Incorporated  [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be clas
sified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4.

With Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given 
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically si
gnificant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2  Serious Ad
 verse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious  Adverse Event 
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
 Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation in the study
 and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of 
the study drug) 
 Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred 
 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
 Persiste
nt or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s abil
ity to conduct normal life functions) 
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Importa nt m
edical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may
 require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred befo
re the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94250], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94251] P155, Version 1.0

Protocol PS-G202, Version 6.0 Page 78 of 88 
Parion Sciences Incorporated  indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94253] (e.g. social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe,” because they ar
 e not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Document a
 tion of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Follow-up Visi
t, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_94315] 24 hours . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Telephone Call and 
are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS and Parion Sciences within 24 hours . 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to 
as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately 
reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_94316](s) and possible etiologies. On the Clinical Trials SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes 
unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study 
analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex and Parion Sciences the outcome of the event using the Vertex Clinical Trials SAE Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious  
 Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, 
regardle
ss of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The Vertex Clinical 
Trial SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.

 erse Device Effect  
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is an ADE that: 
 Led to a death. 
 Led to a
 serious deterioration in health that either: 
o resulted in a life
-threatening illness or injury, or 
o resulted in an injur
y or permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
o required in-
subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
o resulted in me
dical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness. 
 Led to fe
tal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.

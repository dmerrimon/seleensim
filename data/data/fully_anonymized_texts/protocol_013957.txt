Background   
  
  Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is a drug withdrawal syndrome that occurs primarily after 
antenatal exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_858].  Symptoms may be present at birth, but often peak at 48 -72 after 
delivery.  The onset of symptoms is affected by [CONTACT_128533] -life of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_128515].  The incidence of NAS has increased substantially 
since 2000 both nationally and in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, leading to a significant increase in 
healthcare resource utilization and (Figure 1).  
    
  The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that illicit drug abuse affected 
~130,000 pregnancies in the [LOCATION_002] from 2011 -2012 and that approximately 20% of those 
pregnancies (26,000) involved opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]. (SAMSA Center for Behavioral Health Sta tistics and Quality, 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2009 -2012).  Patrick et al. utilized the Kids’ Inpatient Database 
(KID) from the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to evaluate the incidence of maternal opi[INVESTIGATOR_128516]1. He and his team noted a substantial increase in the number of mothers using 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] - 1.19 per 1000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128517] 2000 to 5.63 per 1000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128517] 2009.  As a result, there 
was an increased diagnosis of NAS from 1.20 per 1000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128517] 2000 to 3.39 per 1000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128518] 2009.  This is a 2.8 -fold increase which means that every hour of every day, 1 neonate in the 
[LOCATION_002] undergoes drug withdrawal.   
  
  The Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center reported that 824 infan ts in the state of 
Kentucky were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128519] 2012.  This represents 
an 18% increase from 2011 and a 4.5 fold increase from 2005. (Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research 
Center.  Data for 2010 -2012). Ne onatal Abstinence Syndrome is an issue of epi[INVESTIGATOR_128520].  It results in prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128521].  In 
2009, the total charges for NAS treatment were noted to be approximately $720 mil lion nationally, up 
from approximately $190 million in [ZIP_CODE].  Kentucky data from 2012 report a $[ADDRESS_144966] for 
neonatal drug withdrawal treatment, which has increased from $200,000 in 2000. (Kentucky Injury 
Prevention and Research Center.  Dat a for 2010 -2012).  The majority of these costs (75 -80%) are paid by 
[CONTACT_128534] (Figure 2).   
  
  Precipi[INVESTIGATOR_128522]2.  Symptoms include central nervous system (CNS) signs (seizures, irritability, 
tremors), autonomic disturbances (sweating, yawning, nasal stuffiness, low grade fever, mottling) and 
gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction (diarrhea, vomiting, poor feeding, and regurgitation).  The cohort of 
withdrawal symptoms is dictated by [CONTACT_128535] µ opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], which are concentrated in the 
brain but are also found in sensory nerves, mast cell s and in the GI tract3.   
  
  Treatment of withdrawal symptoms includes symptomatic care for mild symptoms and 
pharmacological intervention in addition to symptomatic care for moderate to severe symptoms.  The 
American Academic of Pediatrics and experts in  the field recommend opi[INVESTIGATOR_128523] [ADDRESS_144967] feeding difficulty, including spi[INVESTIGATOR_22940], 
regurgitation and diarrhea. The Finnegan scoring tool includes a series of feeding assessments within the 
total scoring algorithm (Table 1).  Human milk has been shown to be the best tolerated nutritiona l 
support for most infants and is cited by [CONTACT_128536]6.  
However, the AAP considers the use of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines and unsupervised 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_128524] a contraindication to breast feeding7.  For most street drugs, the risks 
to the infant of ongoing active use by [CONTACT_128537](s) being used and contaminants within the drug are unknown8-11.  The AAP does 
recognize that if a mother is in a supervised methadone treatment center and is free from using other 
drugs of abuse then breastfeeding is an essential component of the infant’s care.  However, most infants 
with NAS are fed formula for a variety of reasons, including con cerns about continued maternal use.  
  
  Human milk is a complete nutritional food for the first 6 months of life in the term infant. Aside 
from its nutritional composition (specific for the support of the human infant), it contains hormones, 
immunoglobuli ns and growth factors that stimulate gastrointestinal growth and motility which, in turn, 
promote the maturation and protection of the GI tract. Mediators such as neurotensin and motilin 
promote GI motility while free amino acids feed intestinal growth 12, 13. Human milk feeding has been 
shown to increase gastric empyting14, [ADDRESS_144968] -natal intestinal colonization by [CONTACT_128538] (Lactobacillus  and Bifidobacteria).  In summary, when compared to formula feeding, human 
milk appears to be a more suitable diet for the neonate at risk for GI dysfunction.  
  
  Two retrospective studies of the effect of breastfeeding on clinical symptoms of NAS have been 
reported.  McQueen et al reviewed 28 mother -infant pairs with maternal methadone exposure and 
infant symptoms of NAS17.  Maternal and infant demographics were re corded along with feeding type, 
Finnegan scores and infant medication utilization during withdrawal. Feeding cohorts were created by 
[CONTACT_128539][INVESTIGATOR_059]. Formula fed infants received >75% of 
all feedings as form ula (n=9), breastfed infants received >75% of feedings at the breast (n=8). The rest 
were considered combination feeders (n=11).  Combination feeders were slightly less mature (35.6 
weeks) and of lower birth weight (2608 g) than breastfed (38.8 weeks and 3 025 g) or formula fed (39.1 
weeks and 3302 grams). Breastfed infants received fewer scores, had significantly lower overall  
Finnegan scores and fewer scores >8 when compared to formula and combination fed infants (p≤0.001).   
  
  Dryden et al. performed a  retrospective cohort study of [ADDRESS_144969] 7 2 hours. 
Multivariate logistic regression showed that the prescribed dose of methadone in these women 
DHM in NAS 05 09 14

  independently influenced the likelihood of pharmacologic treatment for NAS (p<0.001). However, for 
infants that were breastfed for at least 72 hours, the odds of needing pharmacologic treatment for NAS 
was significantly reduced (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 – 0.88, p=0.013).  
  
  Maternal opi[INVESTIGATOR_128525].  The amount of 
methadone and buprenorphine transfered in the breast milk has been found to be small, but may be 
significant enough to lead to some improvement in scores.  
  
  While these studies have reported improvements (decreases) in NAS scoring or reduced 
duration of treatment with breastfeeding, there are no reports that have looked at donor human milk, 
which is tested to be free of illicit drugs, and its effect on the GI sub-scores of the Finnegan algorithm.  
Given the general benefits of human milk for the human infant and these limited reports of improved 
neonatal well -being in breastfed infants with NAS, this study is designed to develop pi[INVESTIGATOR_128526]. 
Specifically, GI sub -scores, as well as total scores, will be compared between infants historically fed 
formula and those enrolled in a 2-week donor human milk study period.   
  
  Purpose of study: to test the following null hypothesis:  
Infants with a diagnosis of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to in-utero 
exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], fed donor human milk, will have similar GI/feeding sub -scores of 
the Finnegan scoring tool when compared to (historic) infants fed formula.  
  
A rejection of the null hypothesis will be used to design a randomized trial of donor human milk in 
infants with NAS.  
  
Eligibility for study enrollment:  
   
Inclusion criteria:  
• Term infants (>37 completed weeks) with a diagnosis of NAS, due to maternal use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] 
(only)  
• Infants will have had moderate to severe NAS symptoms (Finnegan scores >8) that required 
pharmacologic therapy but have been stabilized (captured) on oral morphine (Finnegan scores less than 8 for 24 hours)   
• Breastfeeding is contraindicated or the mother has chosen formula feeding for her baby  
  
[CONTACT_115307]:  
• Preterm infants (<37 completed weeks at birth)

  Methods:  
Once the infant’s withdrawal symptoms have been stabilized with oral morphine and the mother has 
agreed to participation (signed ICF/RA), infants will be assigned to receive only d onor human milk (Co -op 
donor milk, Medolac Laboratories, Lake Oswego, OR) for a period of 2 weeks. Vitamin supplementation 
or other nutritional adjustments will be at the discretion of the attending physician.    
  
Infant Finnegan scores will be assessed according to the current NAS protocol. Oral morphine dosing 
(increases or weaning doses) will be consistent with the current NAS protocol.    
  
Primary outcome:    
Acceptability (no increase in GI sub-scores compared to historic formula-fed controls) Appropriate 
growth

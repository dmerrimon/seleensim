2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
OnabotA X is an onabotulinumtoxinA investigational product being developed for the treatment of 
moderate to severe glabellar lines (GL).  Hyperfunctional facial lines that develop from repeated facial 
expression, such as GL, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_448872].1-[ADDRESS_571726] selectively at the neuromuscular or 
neuroglandular junction to reversibly block presynaptic acetylcholine release.  BOTOX ®
(onab otulinumtoxinA ) was first approved for aesthetic treatment of GL in [ADDRESS_571727] 
common nonsurgical procedures in aesthetic medicine .6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
OnabotulinumtoxinA is the active drug substance in BOTOX/BOTOX Cosmetic and in OnabotA X; 
therefore, safety data from prior studies of BOTOX are r elevant to the benefit/risk assessment for this 
first-in-human study of OnabotA X. 
The clinical efficacy and safety profile of BOTOX has also been demonstrated in multiple Allergan -and 
non-Allergan -sponsored clinical trials across several indications, wi th favorable benefit/risk profiles. In 
general, adverse reactions occur within the first few days following injection of BOTOX, and while 
generally transient, may have a duration of several months or, in rare cases, longer. 
In a meta -analysis conducted b y Brin et al, the most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) among 
subjects treated for GL with BOTOX  were headache, nasopharyngitis, eyelid sensory 
disorder, eyelid ptosis, injection site pain, and nausea.9All of th ese events were mild or moderate in 
severity, and the incidence decreased with increasing number of treatment cycles.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013]. 
 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected 
AEs of OnabotA X may be found in the Investigator 's Brochure and the subject 's informed consent form 
(ICF).
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the current 
OnabotA X Investigator's Brochure.
Considering the coronavir us disease –2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study have been re -evaluated.  Based on the limited information to date, n o 
additional risk to study subjects is anticipated with the use of OnabotA X. 
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
3.1 Objectives, Hypotheses, and Estimands
Primary
The primary objectives of this study are:
Efficacy:  To compare the efficacy of OnabotA X and placebo for the treatment of GL in subjects with

Immunogenicity 
Blood samples for immunogenicity testing will be collected from all subjects according to the Study 
Activities Table ( Appendix D).  Collected samples will be process ed to yield serum for detection of 
binding and neutralizing antibodies to OnabotulinumtoxinA.
Hypersensitivity 
In suspected cases of anaphylaxis, blood samples should be collected within [ADDRESS_571729] AGLSS scores of moderate or severe GL at maximum contraction (also called frown 
or furrow) by [CONTACT_65019] r and subject assessments. 
Approximately 280 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 18sites. Eligible subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to receive OnabotA X  or placebo .Randomization 
will be stratified at each i nvestigator site by [CONTACT_093] -assessed baseline severity of GL (AGLSS 
score) at maximum contraction. Overall study enrollment will be monitored to achieve an 
approximately balanced  distribution of subjects with investigator -assessed mod erate or 
severe GL at maximum contraction at baseline.
 
Safety parameters  
will be monitored (see Operations Manual [Appendix F]Section 3). At 
 females of childbearing potential will 
undergo pregnancy testing. For all subjects, AEs will be collected, whe ther solicited or spontaneously 
reported by [CONTACT_423]. Blood samples for immunogenicity testing will be collected  
Efficacy will be evaluated based on AGLSS assessed by [CONTACT_136713], and based on 
subject responses to FLSQ,
 
Standardized facial photography will be collected at all study 
visits from Day 1 through study exit.

product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is an y complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device damage or not 
working properly, or packaging issues.
 
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events:  O nabotA X
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unf avorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations" such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or 
accidental exposure, off- label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether associated with an AE or not.  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnorm alities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them 
to be AEs.
 
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/proce dure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].been pre -planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharm acovigilance or Clinical Research Organization (as appropriate) as a 
SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.2of the Operations 
Manual [ Appendix F] for reporting details and contact [CONTACT_3031]):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_448873] i n an admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_448874]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of re latively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical e vent that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment ,may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event along with any suspected transmission of an 
infectious agent via a medicinal product if no other serious criterion 
is applicable.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration will be collected for at least [ADDRESS_571743].

Possible Distant Spread of Toxin
Possible distant spread of toxin (PDSOT) is defined as a possible pharmacologic effect of botulinum toxin 
at sites noncontiguous and distant from the site of injection.  Utilizing a standardized methodology to 
assess for PDSOT, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA )preferred term s (PTs) that may 
be associated with botulinum toxin effects have been prospectively identified (see the statistical analysis 
plan [SAP] for a complete list of these PTs).  AEs reporting any of these terms will be medically reviewed 
on a regular basis throu ghout the study and will be summarized in the clinical study report.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe.
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.
Severe The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities 
and may be incapacitating or life threatening.

7.4 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
Summary and Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
Analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted on the ITT population based on treatment as 
randomized.  Missing data will be imputed using MI method described in Section 7.3.The evaluation of 
the equality of the proportions of responders will be based on Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test 
stratified by [CONTACT_448876] -rated AGLSS at maximum contraction. Wald confidence intervals for 
proportions of responders and difference in the proportion of responders will be presented.
The Breslow -Day homogeneity of the odds -ratio test will be performed to test the treatment -by-
investigator- rated baseline GL severity at maximum contraction interaction.
Summary and Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
The proportion of responders will be analyzed using CMH test, stratified by [CONTACT_448876] -rated 
AGLSS at maximum contraction. Missing da ta will be imputed using MI method.
Statistical testing will only be done between each OnabotA X group and the placebo group.
 
 
 
7.5 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. The safety parameters will include
incidence of AEs, change from baseline in vital signs and laboratory (hematology/chemistry)
assessments, and ECG. Safety endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics and/or shift 
tables, as applicable.  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as any AE with theonset that is after the first dose of s tudy

error rate of α=0.05 for each OnabotA X group.  
 
 
 
7.8 Sample Size Determination
The sample size was chosen empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]. The primary efficacy parameter is the proportion of subjects 
with a ≥ 1-grade improvement from baseline according to investigator -rated AGLSS at maximum 
contraction a t Day 30. Based on previous BOTOX studies, the responder rate of ≥ 1-grade improvement 
from baseline on the GL severity scale  Assuming  
responder rate for OnabotA X and placebo, respectively, at least [ADDRESS_571747] the above intervention difference with a power of 90% or greater at the 2

 The following includes all aspects of the protocol entitled, “ The Impact of Self -Management with 
Probiotics on Urinary Symptoms and the Urine Microbiome in Individuals with Spi[INVESTIGATOR_498571]” in which we propose use of intravesicular Lactobacillus to reduce 
urinary symptoms in people with neuropathic bladder.  
 
Specific Aim 2 Methods and Procedures : Develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a UTI Self -Management Protocol 
using Probiotics (SMP PRO) to reduce the severity, frequency and impact of urinary 
symptom s. The validated Urinary Symptom Questionnaire for people with Neuropathic Bladder 
(USQ -NB; developed in Aim 1 of this study , currently in progress  IRB # 2012 -187) will be the 
linchpin of the SMP PRO protocol.  The principal utility of the SMP PRO will be in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_498572] i dentify the symptoms that signal recourse to  increase fluid intake to reduce 
symptoms, initiate  probiotic t reatment, or seek medical attention .  
 
Development of the SMP PRO has been  an iterative participatory design process. The 
multidi sciplinary team began  refining the decision tree underlying the protocol, concurrent with 
development of the  USQ -NB, informed by [CONTACT_498598], and later  will be assessed  
through large scale national testing  in conjunction with U nited Spi[INVESTIGATOR_498573]. The  prototype 
SMP PRO will be shared with a diverse sample of individuals with Spi[INVESTIGATOR_171514] ( SB), Spi[INVESTIGATOR_478320]  (SCI), and Multiple Sclerosis  to develop use cases and scenarios of use to further inform 
the protocol. These patients further informing the SMP PRO will include adults, youth, and 
children, both genders, persons who reuse ca theters and those who don’t,  among individuals with 
SCI, SB, and MS  who use intermittent catheterization for their bladder management .  Participants 
will engage in semi -structured interviews in which they will be asked to recall the onset and 
progression of symptoms in their most recent  epi[INVESTIGATOR_498574] . The interviewer will 
then ask participants to mentally step through th e exp erience of urinary symptoms : 1) to confirm 
that the prototype SMP PRO can be triggered by [CONTACT_498599] -NB and 2) to 
elucidate the mechanics of implementing the protocol across the diversity of individuals with 
neuropathic bladder due to SB , SCI or MS . Interview data will be managed, coded, and 
thematically analyzed using NVivo [ADDRESS_740352] a mu lti 
phase  pi[INVESTIGATOR_100739] 1 20 individuals with neuropathic bladder due to SB or SCI / Multiple 
Scleorosis  to study its safety, acceptability and perceived usefulness. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_498575] -NB and records of any urinary symptoms and UTIs  that are experienced.  
 
Phase I a: Safety study of a single bladder instillation  of probiotic  in adults . A subsample of 
healthy adults  with neuropathic bladder who do not have urinary symptoms meeting the criteria 
for antibiotic treatment  of urinary tract infection  or initiation of the protocol  will undergo a single 
intravesical instillation of Lactobacillus to determine the tolerability  of the instillation, safety of a 
single instillation, and whether the instilled Lactobacillus persists in the urine.  
Study Design: We will recruit N =5 adult subjects with neuropathic bladder due to SCI or SB.

required for UTI diagnosis in patients using intermittent catheterization: new onset or worsening 
fever, rigors, altered mental status, malaise, lethargy with no other identified cause, flank pain, 
costov ertebral angle tenderness, acute hematuria, pelvic discomfort, increased spasticity,

and there are ≥103 cfu/hpf bacterial growth on urine culture, the subject will be excluded and 
treated for a UTI according to clinical best practice.  
Baseline Data Collection:  After consent, participants will complete the Health History 
Questionnaire  Thereafter, participants will complete the Urinar y Symptom Questionnaire  (USQ -
NB) weekly.  
Intervention:  After 6 months of baseline data collection, participants will receive the 
Lactobacillus  (Culturelle)  kits. Participants  will be instructed on preparation and intravesicular 
instillation of the Lactoba cillus , and will have a tutorial with a fellow consumer on use of the 
patient -initiated SMP PRO. Participants will receive [ADDRESS_740365] Injury and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_498585]  
5/18/[ADDRESS_740366] them  to complete the USQ -NB weekly.  
If/when urinary symptoms occur, they will be instructed to follow the SMP PRO protocol  to 
determine whether to initiate intravesicular Lactoba cillus  instillatio n or to seek medical attention . 
The self -management protocol will also direct them to discontinue Lactobacillus  instillation or  to 
seek medical attention  if symptoms remit, persist or worsen. If participants are directed by [CONTACT_498604]-manag ement protoco l to seek medical attention  or s/he feels the need for medical evaluation, 
s/he will be advised to obtain care as they typi[INVESTIGATOR_498586]. 
Participants will be supplied with letters to be brought to their health care  provider notifying them 
of the study and requesting sharing of urinalysis and urine culture results with the research team. 
A verified UTI will include those that resulted in antibiotic treatment  prescribed  by a health care 
professional.  
 
For the intraves icular Lactobacillus  instillation, the contents of 1 Lactobacillus  capsule will be 
mixed into 45 cc sterile 0.9% saline (adult bladder volume is 450cc, represent ing 10% of adult 
bladder volume).  After mixing, study participants  will draw up the 45 cc of the liquid 
Lactobacillus  mixture into a 60cc catheter tip syringe and instill via the intermittent catheter  using 
sterile technique . For children volume is based on age (see table on page 4 of protocol).  
 
Study participant will recheck symptoms after 24 hrs (valid range 22 -30 hrs) following the 
SMP PRO  protocol and either perform  another Lactobacillus instillation or seek medical attention , 
per the subjects choice . If symptoms still persist [ADDRESS_740367]-Intervention Follow -Up: After completion of the 6 -month patient -initiated self -management 
protocol intervention period, participants will monitor symptoms weekly using the USQ -NB. 
 
Measurements:  
Health History Questionnaire : After subjects give consent, a brief medical history will be 
conducted using a structured questionnaire, to  obtain  demographic information and relevant 
family history (these items will be collected only at baseline), and genitourinary history  
Urinary Symptom Questionnaire  (USQ -NB): A preliminary urinary symptom questionnaire 
has been developed with consumer input based on the most common typi[INVESTIGATOR_498587] /MS-specific 
urinary symptoms. The final version (developed in Specific Aim  1 IRB # 2014 -187) will be used 
in this phase of the study.  USQ -NB will be completed weekly.  All participants will receive a link 
to the questionnaire every Sunday morning. If they have not  responded by [CONTACT_498605], they 
will receive another link. If they have not responded by [CONTACT_498606], the study participant will 
receive a phone call. If there is no response by [CONTACT_498607], it is considered a missed event.  
Patient satisfaction : We have developed a simple four item patient satisfaction “survey” that 
will be requested at the end of each timeframe. Participants will be asked to rate their satisfaction, 
thinking only about the preceding time period, with changes in the frequency  of their symptoms; 
the amelioration of the severity  of their symptoms; and changes in the impact  of their symptoms. 
A 5-point Likert scale will be used for each of these items (not at all satisfied; not very satisfied; 
no perceived difference; satisfied; and  very satisfied). A fourth item, “Can you estimate, using a 
scale from 0% <would absolutely never do this>, through 50% <might do this> to 100% <would 
absolutely always do this>, whether or not you would seek this intervention out and pay for it 
yourself i f insurance did not pay for it”.

presents with any of these symptoms and there are ≥103 cfu/hpf bacterial growth on urine culture, 
the subject will be excluded and treated for a UTI according to clinical best practice.  
 
Participant Burden :   
Urine samples for urinalysis, urine culture and metagenomic sequencing will be obtained at up to 
monthly for the first year of study participation when not experiencing symptoms , at up to 2 
occurrences of urinary symptoms during SMP PRO intervention phase , and follow -up after either 
lactobacillus treatment or antibiotics  and at follow -up, for a total of up to 18  samples per patient 
depending on the frequency with which urinary symptoms are experienced. When possible, our 
Research Assistant will meet with the patient at a mutually convenient location.  
 
 
 
 
Baseline Data Collection:   
Per IRB protocol # 2014 -211 phase II, after consent, participants will complete the Health History 
Questionnaire, Urinary Symptom Questionnaire, In addition to questionnaires, all participants 
will provide a urine sample using sterile catheterization techniques. Thereafter, participants will 
complete the Urinary Symptom Questionnaire weekly.  
 
Intervention:  
 After 6 months of baseline data collection the intervention phase will begin. Prior to 
implementing the intervention protocol, participants will provide study staff with a urine sample 
either at MedStar NRH, CNMC, or when possible, the study RA will meet with the participant at 
a mutually convenient location. After urine sample is collected, study participants will follow the 
study protocol and complete USQ -NB weekly. If/when urinary symptoms occur, they will be 
instructed to follow the SMP PRO protocol to determine whether to initiate intravesicular 
Lactobacillus  instillation or be evaluated by a physician. The self -management protocol 
(SMP PRO) will also direct them to discontinue Lactobacillus  instillation or be evaluated by a 
physician if symptoms remit, persist or worsen. If participants are directed by [CONTACT_193526] -
management protocol to seek medical attention or s/he feels the need for medical evaluation, s/he 
will be advised to obtain care as they typi[INVESTIGATOR_498586]. Participants  
will be supplied with letters to be brought to their health care provider notifying them of the study 
and requesting sharing of urinalysis and urine culture results with the research team. A verified 
UTI will include those that resulted in antibiotic trea tment by a health care professional. An 
additional urine sample for metagenomics will either be left with the health care provider for pi[INVESTIGATOR_498591], brought to the research site, or obtained by [CONTACT_498609] a mutually 
convenient site. If parti cipant is treating urinary symptoms at home with Lactobacillus, a urine 
sample will be dropped off either at MedStar NRH, CNMC or when possible, the study RA will 
meet with the participant at a mutually convenient location.

 For the intravesicular Lactobaci llus instillation, the contents of 1 Lactobacillus  capsule will be 
mixed into 45 cc sterile 0.9% saline (adult bladder volume is 450cc, so this amount represents 
10% of adult bladder volume).  After mixing, study personnel will draw up the 45 cc of the liq uid 
Lactobacillus  mixture into a 60cc catheter tip syringe and instill via the intermittent catheter. For 
children volume is based on age (see table on page 4 of protocol). Study participant will recheck 
symptoms after 24 hrs (valid range 22 -30 hrs) follow ing the SMP PRO protocol and either complete 
another Lactobacillus instillation or seek medical attention. If symptoms still persist [ADDRESS_740371]-Intervention Follow -Up:  
After completion of the 6 -month patient -initiated self -management protocol intervention period, 
participants will monitor symptoms weekly using the USQ -NB. At the end of follow -up, we will 
obtain another urine sample from all participants.  
 
Measurements:  
In add ition to the measurements described in Phase II the following measurements will occur for 
phase III;  
Urine Acquisition : A [ADDRESS_740372] for (1) 
urinalysis and cultivation, and (2) urine microbiome by [CONTACT_498610]. Urine will be 
collected from a new, unused intermittent catheter.  
Urine Preparation : Collected urine will be immediately placed at 4°C. Within 6 hours, 
samples will be taken to CNMC for sequencing preparation. At CNMC, urine samples will be 
centrifu ged at 4°C, 5,000 x g for 20 minutes. The supernatant will be aliquoted in 2 ml cryotubes 
and frozen at -20°C. 10ml PBS will be added to the pellet with the remaining supernatant and 
then centrifuged (5,000xg) at 4°C for 20 minutes. The pellets and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_498592] -20°C. Pellets will later be transferred for DNA isolation and SMRT sequencing.  
Urinalysis : Urine samples will be assessed utilizing standard clinical microbiology 
semiquantitative chemical testing using commercial d isposable test strips for glucose, bilirubin, 
ketone, specific gravity, blood pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leukocyte esterase. After 
centrifuging for [ADDRESS_740373] microbial techniques.  
Urine Culture : Standard urine culture microbiology will be performed. A measured amount is 
inoculated to each of the appro priate media. A calibrated loop designed to deliver a known 
volume (0.0 I ml per loopful) of urine is used. The sample will be mixed the thoroughly and the 
top of the container removed. A calibrated wire -inoculating loop is flamed and allowed to cool 
witho ut coming in contact [CONTACT_498611]. The sterile loop is inserted into the urine sample 
vertically and urine is allowed to adhere to the loop. The loopful of urine is inoculated over 
MacConkey agar plates using standard methods. Similarly, a second loopf ul is collected and 
inoculated on a blood agar plate. The plates are incubated aerobically at [ADDRESS_740374] 24 
hours. The colonies and colony forming units (CFUs) are counted by [CONTACT_498612] 100 (since 
0.01 ml loop was used).  
SMRT Sequencing Met hods: Thawed urine samples will be clarified by [CONTACT_6398] -speed 
centrifugation and bacterial genomic DNA will be isolated from pelleted bacteria using a DNeasy 
tissue extraction kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instruction. 16S rRNA genes will be 
amplifi ed using universal primers 28F 5’ - AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG -3’ and 1492R 5’ -
ACCTTGTTACGACTT -3’.  These primers will amplify sequences that correspond to the 
sequence between positions [ADDRESS_740375] Injury and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_498585]

 preparation using DNA Template Prep Kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences) followed by [CONTACT_498613] (DNA Polymerase Binding Kit P4, Pacific Biosciences). Briefly, ends of t he 
16S rRNA will be repaired with the Klenow DNA polymerase, SMRT Bell adapters will be 
ligated with the PCR products, followed by [CONTACT_498614] P4 DNA polymerase. Ternary complexes will be loaded on to SMRT cells and 
sequenced on the Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument using DNA Sequencing Reagent 2.0 and 
one 90 min movie. Resulting circular consensus sequence (CCS) reads will be used for taxonomic 
classification and diversity measurements. The amount  of ternary complex needed for the optimal 
loading of the zero molecular waveguides (ZMW) will be optimized by [CONTACT_498615]. Sequenced rRNA genes will be 
analyzed and classified using Pathoscope.  We wi ll use the following formula to determine the 
number of SMRT cells needed to detect most/all bacterial species in our samples: # of SMRT 
cells = (189 * 1 * 87/30,000).  Our preliminary data from [ADDRESS_740376]/all bacterial species in the sample and accurate sequence 
determination 1 SMRT cell per patient sample will be sufficient.  
     Patient satisfaction : We have developed a simple four item patient satisfaction “survey” that 
will be requested at the end of each timeframe. Participants will be asked to rate their satisfaction, 
thinking only about the preceding time period, with changes in the frequency  of their symptoms; 
the amelioration of the severity  of their symptoms; and ch anges in the impact  of their symptoms. 
A 5-point Likert scale will be used for each of these items (not at all satisfied; not very satisfied; 
no perceived difference; satisfied; and very satisfied). A fourth item, “Can you estimate, using a 
scale from 0% < would absolutely never do this>, through 50% <might do this> to 100% <would 
absolutely always do this>, whether or not you would seek this intervention out and pay for it 
yourself if insurance did not pay for it”.    
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
A Data  Safety Monitoring Board has been established. Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) reports will be prepared monthly during the Phase I “Baseline: Safety Evaluation  of a 
Single Instillation in Adults ” period, and then two times a year (or as requested b y the DSMB)  for 
Phase II .  Each report will consist of five sections, including: 1) recruitment, 2) adverse effects of 
the investigational product (i.e. the intravesicular Lactobacillus instillation), 3) completion of the 
Urinary Symptom Questionnaire (USQ -NB), 4) completion of, and adherence to, the Self -
Management Protocol (SMP PRO), and 5) data accrual and quality.  The recruitment section will 
include counts for screening (eligible v. ineligible), enrollment (consented v. declined), and 
retention (completion of phase milestones and transitions v. withdrawal or lost -to-follow -up).  For 
reporting purposes, subgroups will include age (adult v. child), neuropathic bladder etiology 
(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17751] v. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_171514]), and standard demographics (i.e. ge nder, race, and ethnicity).  
The adverse effects section will report all adverse outcomes that appear to be associated with the 
investigational product, and will include specific event details, relevant tests and laboratory 
results, relevant histories (inc luding pre -existing and co -existing medical conditions), use of 
concomitant medications, and investigational product dose, frequency, route of instillation, timing 
of instillation, manufacturer’s lot number, and manufacturer’s expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] (as appropria te for 
completion of the MedWatch FDA Form 3500A).  The USQ -NB completion section will report 
the frequency of on -line survey completion, with and without the need for study staff reminders.  
The SMP PRO completion/adherence section will report the frequenc y of on -line survey 
completion, with and without reminders, as well as the appropriateness/correctness of protocol

Individuals with Spi[INVESTIGATOR_498570]  
5/18/[ADDRESS_740377] of urinary symptoms and UTIs 
(PRIMARY OUTCOMES) .  The goal of aim [ADDRESS_740378] to find a significant 
difference in these primary outcomes between our three experimental timeframes (6 months prior 
to intervention, 6 months of SMP PRO intervention, and 6  month follow -up period).  Frequency of 
UTI will be defined as the number of verified UTIs occurring during the timeframe. Urinary 
symptoms will be assessed using the USQ -NB where frequency of symptoms, degree of severity, 
and impact on the individual, will be considered.   
We will estimate the average number of symptoms on the USQ -NB endorsed  
(irrespective of frequency, severity and impact) across the weeks during that time frame, for each 
participant. Thus, each participant will have a continuous outcome (average number of USQ -NB 
items endorsed ). We will also compute the number of verified UTIs experienced by [CONTACT_37117]. These two outcomes are the primary outcomes for our study and analysis; they 
depend solely on the face validity of the  USQ -NB,and on clinically verified UTIs, and so will not 
be affected by a failure to find or establish formal measurement properties for the USQ -NB, 
should any occur. They will also be less subject to any variability in participant perceptions of 
frequency, severity or impact, which can complicate analytic a ssumptions and limit power and 
interpretability of change that might be perceived. We will describe these features of the sample 
over time but will not conduct inference tests on these ratings.  
We propose linear mixed -effects modeling to explore the effect  of introduction to/use of 
the SMP PRO on the number of USQ -NB symptoms (averaged over the entire time frame) and the 
incidence of UTIs. Each model will include gender as a fixed effect, and time (baseline; SMP PRO 
use; post -SMP PRO observation) as the explanatory variable, and random effects for intercept 
(subject) only. This method allows for missing data and the inclusion of covariates where 
appropriate; however we plan post -hoc analyses of the modeling in order to pi[INVESTIGATOR_498593] (e.g., between age or sex and time).  The focus of the analyses is to determine 
whether (irrespective of individual starting values or specific slopes) mean USQ -NB item 
endorsement and UTI counts go down in the SMP PRO time frame rel ative to the baseline values 
(generally negative associations in each regression between the outcome and time) and whether 
these values stay flat (zero slope), continue to decrease (negative slope) or increase (positive 
slope) during the post -SMP PRO follow  up.  
Power calculation : We plan to use mixed effects regression modeling for the most 
precision in our estimated effects of the SMP PRO on the USQ -NB symptom rate and UTI rate. 
However, it is difficult to predict the exact form of the final models since ou r understanding of 
the USQ -NB symptom makeup, and the univariate associations between gender or age (or any 
other of the demographic variables we will collect) and these two outcomes. Therefore, for the 
most conservative estimates, we use the most basic an alytic method to estimate the worst -case 
scenario power calculation, a t -test. In this pair of primary outcomes, alpha is set at 0.025 for each 
power calculation (and for each inference test). We will have data from 100 participants; 
however, to protect ag ainst a possible 20% drop out rate over the course of the 1 8-month study, 
we will recruit 120 persons for this arm, hopi[INVESTIGATOR_48908] a final N of 100. If we observe an average of 
25 items on the USQ -NB endorsed over the baseline period, then with alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_740379] 81% power to detect a reduction in this average number of items endorsed as low as five

 (i.e., to detect a change from an average of 25 to an average of 20) during the SMP PRO period, 
assuming that the standard deviation of the average number o f endorsed USQ -NB items is as high 
as 16. If we observe an average of one UTI per month in the initial 6 -month period (for an 
average of six UTIs across this sample of 100 persons), then, with the alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_740380] 81% power to detect a reductio n in this average number of UTIs as low as 1.25 (i.e., to 
detect a change from an average of 6 to an average of 4.75) during the SMP PRO period, assuming 
that the standard deviation of the number of UTIs is as high as 4. We will explore the consistency 
of the UTI variable with the assumption of a normal distribution, and if appropriate we may 
utilize Poisson modeling if the assumption of normality is violated.  
 Additionally, because we have the potential to carefully describe the symptom profile for 
neuropat hic bladder generally and for SCI /MS and SB specifically, we also plan secondary 
analyses based on the USQ -NB items. Frequency, severity, and impact of each of the USQ -NB 
symptoms will be estimated for each participant, within each of the study timeframes.  Each of 
these symptom characteristics will be rated on an ordinal scale, so f or each symptom  on the USQ -
NB, the median frequency rating from their weekly USQ -NBs will be computed. These ordinal 
outcomes will be explored for similarities and differences ac ross sex, age, injury (SB/SCI /MS), 
and other demographic variables that could be useful in diagnosis or management of USQ -NB 
symptoms by [CONTACT_498616]. Descriptive statistics for each primary 
outcome (frequency, duration, and  severity of each UTI) and their change from baseline, will be 
produced for each time frame. We will generate preliminary (underpowered and not corrected for 
multiple comparisons) estimates of the strengths of associations between item frequency, 
severity,  and impact with time, sex, age, satisfaction with the SMP -UTI, and etiology 
(SCI/MS/ SB). If the reliability and validity evidence from Aim [ADDRESS_740381] evidence of invariance over time, these estimates would be considered preliminary .

probiotics will reduce bladder inflammation (Secondary outcome) . For those [ADDRESS_740382] white blood count (WBC) from the urinalysis. WBC counts will be 
obtained only at the start of each timeframe, and so can be analyzed longitudinally as continuous 
variables representing the [ADDRESS_740383]-SMP PRO, relative to the baseline pre -treatment periods.   
 
H3. Compared with usual management, self -management of urinary symptoms with 
probiotics will reduce the need for antibiotics to treat UTI (Secondary outcome) . The 
number of times antibiotics are used for each patient will be obtained from their medical records 
or self report. This value will be analyzed with the same three -point longitudinal mixed effects 
regression model with time as the factor of interest. Depending on the distribution of the outcome 
(i.e. given the count nature of this outcome, it may be Poisson distributed), we will utilize either 
linear or Poisson regression models.  This  analysis will assess whether there is an association 
between UT I rate during use of the SMP PRO, and post -SMP PRO exposure, relative to UTI rate 
during the baseline pre -treatment period.

 H4. Compared with usual management, self -management of urinary symp toms with 
probiotics will return the microbiome to baseline (Secondary outcome) . For analysis of the 
microbiome, the fasta and fastq files of each sample’s CCS reads will be retrieved and processed 
using LUCY54 to filter out reads with low quality segments, as well as remove sequences that are 
shorter than the full length 16S rRNA (approximately 1500 bp). The sequences will then be 
aligned against the SILVA 16S rRNA database followed by [CONTACT_498617]’s Chimera Slayer  to filter out chimeric reads from sequences in each sample. The 
remaining sequences will undergo taxonomic classification. Bowtie2 will align each sequence 
read to a reference genome derived from the SILVA 16S database and outp ut a SAM file. With 
the resulting SAM file, Pathoscope [ADDRESS_740384] once during the 6 -month SMP time frame will be stratified into two groups, those who 
responded to SMP and those who did not; we will define “response” as the observation of a 10% 
or more d ecrease in the average number of USQ items endorsed within any time frame, so that 
each of the 50 persons in this sub -sample will be characterized as either a responder (10% or 
more decrease) or a non -responder (0 -9.99% decrease).  A scatter plot of respon se group versus 
Shannon Index will be produced, and a mixed effects linear regression model will test the 
individual (main) and interaction effects of response group and time on Shannon Index. A 
positive time coefficient is indicative of increased microbio me diversity and a negative time 
coefficient indicates reduces diversity. The magnitude of difference between the response groups 
will be determined using the Yue -Clayton theta similarity index (
 ). The 
  index measures the 
difference in the number and rel ative abundance of bacterial species between samples4,5 when

1. BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Background 
Approximately 4% of the American population suffers from food allergy  [1].  More specifically, 
over [ADDRESS_469302] decade particularly in the pediatric po pulation [2].  In 
addition, peanut aller gy is the leading cause of fatal allergic reactions in the [LOCATION_002]  [3, 4].  
Currently, the standard of care for peanut allergy is a strict avoidance of peanut and ready -access to 
self-injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] ; however, implementation of an avoidance  diet is complex and 
accidental ingestions are common.  In one report, u p to 50% of food -allergic patients had an allergic 
reaction during a two -year period  [5].  More recent data shows that the annual incidence rate for 
food allergic reactions following accidental exposure is ~15% for children with peanut allergy  [6].  
Since only 20% of peanut allergy is estimated to be naturally outgrown, the majority of patients face a life-long risk of anaphylaxis and death [7 , 8]. 
 
1.2 Rationale  
Traditional subcutaneous immunotherapy is useful in treating forms of inhalant and venom allergies but has proven unsafe in treating food allergy  [9, 10].  Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has been reported 
by [CONTACT_374873] a variety of food 
proteins [11-19].  In a recent open-label peanut OIT trial by [CONTACT_80952]., [ADDRESS_469303] demonstrated that OIT induc es clinical 
desensitization to peanut, with humoral and cellular changes suggestive of the development of long-term tolerance [12].   Furthermore, p eanut OIT appears to be safe in children with peanut allergy 
treated in a controlled setting by [CONTACT_21724] [20].   
 Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has also been proposed as  a safe, alternative form of 
immunotherapy to reduce clinical reaction rates during oral food challenge for adults with hazelnut  
[21] or kiwi allergy  [22].   [CONTACT_318224]’ research team  has shown that 12 months of peanut SLIT is 
able to induce an increase in reaction threshold while receiving the SLIT study drug, i.e. , clinical 
desensitization  [23].  While clinical desensitization is demonstrated  in almost all OIT and SLIT 
studies for food allergy, tolerance, which refers to a non -reactive state of the immune system that 
persists after discontinuation of peanut study drug, has only rarely been tested and requires further 
study.  Recent data presen ted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Burks’ research team since the onset of this trial has shown 
that basophils retu rn to their reactive state after the discontinuation of immunotherapy ([24]).  This 
suggests that the effect of OIT and SLIT may be transient  with the development of true 
immunological tolerance only a rare occurrence.   On this background, the term sustained 
unresponsiveness (SU) was coined ( [25]) to refer to the phenomenon of a non- reactive state that 
persists after discontinuation of therapy but wanes after a period of time.  
 
Various studies of OIT and SLIT  have looked at SU but these studies have been small and

Version 6.0, March 2, 2016                                                                                                             Page 12 of 43 heterogeneous making it difficult to make generalizations  [17, 26, 27].  The loss of SU and the 
desensitization effect has not yet been studied in a systematic fashion within a single population.  
With the FDA approval of food immunotherapy potentially on the horizon, practical questions have arisen including questions about  the frequency of dosing and the response to missed doses due to 
illness, non -compliance, or other factors.  We hope that an understanding of the characteristics of 
SU will provide important clinical data in anticipation of the broader use of immunotherapy for food allergy while giving further insights into the immune mechanisms of desensitization, SU, and 
the loss of SU.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_469304] a history of clinical allergy to pea nut or 
serologic evidence of allergic sensitization with a specific IgE> 0.35 kU/L to peanut.  The age group 
for study was selected based on our ongoing peanut SLIT trial (NCT# 00597727; UNC IRB 11 -
2296; Duke Pro00001553) which has demonstrated successful d esensitization to peanut in this age 
group.    
 
1.4 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Participants  
 
1.4.1 Risks 
The build -up and daily maintenance doses of SLIT may cause allergic symptoms including 
sneezing, rhinorrhea, urticaria, angioedema, flushing, flares of eczema, ocular, nasal, oral and/or throat pruritus, throat tightness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, cough, wheezing, and/or 
shortness of breath in addition to severe anaphylaxis.  The most common symptom associated with 
SLIT dosing is oropharyngeal itching present in 9.3% of all doses.   As of October 24, 2012, no 
subject in our ongoing SLIT study (NCT# 00597727; UNC IRB 11 -2296; Duke Pro00001553) has 
had dosing -related anaphylaxis requiring treatment with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  [23].  The likelihood of a 
subject experiencing allergic symptoms will be lessened by [CONTACT_374874].   
 
Double-blind, placebo -controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) may induce an allergic response with 
symptoms similar to those described for SLIT dosing.  The risk of a severe allergic reaction is reduced by [CONTACT_374875] a monitored clinic setting, initiating the challenge with a very small amount of the food, gradually increa sing the dose, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_374861] a reaction.  If subjects have an allergic reaction during the challenges, they may need oral, intramuscular, or intravenous medications (subjects will have an IV catheter in place during all DBPCFCs).  Trained personnel, including a physician, as well as medications and equipment, will 
be immediately available to treat any reaction.  
 Other risks include those related to blood drawing and skin testing.  Blood drawing may aggravate a 
pre-existing anemic condition, but this risk is minimized by [CONTACT_374876] a 
maximum of 3 ml per kg in accordance with [LOCATION_002] Department of Health and Human 
Services recommendations  [28].  Additional risks are those attendant to any needle puncture, 
including slight bruising, local infection, or the possibility of the subject fainting.

Version 6.0, March 2, [ADDRESS_469306] for a period of time after the discontinuation of therapy .  We 
will address our hypothesis through investigations focused on the following objectives :  
Primary Objective:  
First, we aim to estimate the population sensitization threshold, the dose predicted to provoke 
reactions in X% of the peanut -allergic population after at least [ADDRESS_469307] to time for 
several end points including time for desensitization  threshold as assessed by [CONTACT_374878], to drop by a level of t he administered dose 
level, to remain above minimal clinically relevant threshold (MCRT) and finally, to  maintain 
threshold constancy.  
 
Purpose and expectations :   
This two-part primary objective is designed to estimate the level of desensitization induced by 
[CONTACT_374879] a desensitization decay  curve.  We expect to demonstrate 
successful desensitization above the MCRT (300 mg peanut protein) for the population and to 
demonstrate SU  for a period of time between [ADDRESS_469308] of missed doses/non -compliance.  These results could also shed f urther insight into the immune mechanisms 
involved in the development and loss of desensitization.  
 Secondary Objectives:  
Objective #2:  To evaluate the safety of SLIT regimen administered over the study period.  
Purpose and Expectations:  
Through Objective #2 , we will determine the percentage of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse 
events (SAE) due to peanut SLIT dosing.  There will be a particular focus on symptoms that require 
treatment and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], symptoms that may lead to poorer compliance, and gastrointestinal 
symptoms suggestive of eosinophilic disease.  We expect that SAEs will be extremely rare.  We expect AEs to be more common but to be mostly comprised of transient oropharyngeal itching that 
does not affect compliance.  We expect symptoms of GI and eosinophilic disease to be rare as very 
little peanut is ingested by [CONTACT_374880]# 11 -2308

among subjects who were successfully  desensitization  vs. those who failed.   Changes coinciding 
with the loss of desensitization would also be studied.  
 
Purpose and Expectations : 
Through Objective #3, we will seek to understand the molecular processes by [CONTACT_374881] .  We will de lineate the impact of peanut SLIT on the subsequent cellular and 
humoral response s to peanut protein: 1) peanut specific IgE, IgG , and IgG4 response, 2) peanut 
specific basophil activation, 3) mast cell responses through skin prick testing, and 4) specific T-cell 
cytokine responses and T regulatory cell (TReg) activation.   We anticipate that the effect of peanut 
SLIT will occur by [CONTACT_374882], conversion of T cells from an allergic (Th2) to a non- allergic 
(Th1) lymphocyte response (measured by [CONTACT_167356], antibody levels, and skin prick test size), a change in peanut -specific basophil activation, or through a combination of the above .   
 
Based on mechanistic studies of subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis [29], OIT for food 
allergies [12], and our previous work with SLIT for peanut allergies [23], our expectation is that the  
immunoglobulin response will change over time  resulting in a decrease in peanut -specific IgE and 
an increase in peanut -specific IgG and IgG4 .  We anticipate an increase in T
Reg specific cytokin es, 
such as IL -[ADDRESS_469309] less sensitive to peanuts, but this would likely occur 
through an alternative mechanism or a mechanism combining T
Reg activation with other T cell 
changes.  A change in basophil activation would indicate that subjects would be less sensitive to 
peanut, and we anticipate that response would be in parallel to the fi nding of clinical desensitization 
but may not indicate clinical tolerance development.  Overall, we will assess these immune parameters over time and in conjunction with clinical levels of reactivity to determine which mechanism(s) is relevant for effectiv e peanut SLIT in desensitization and ultimately the 
maintenance or loss of desensitization . 
 Objective # 4: To evaluate association of baseline characteristics with desensitization as assessed by 
[CONTACT_941] 48
th month DBPCFC and with loss of desensitization  as assessed by [CONTACT_374883].  
 Purpose and Expectations:  
Preliminary data using peanut SLIT suggested a range of responses to treatment.  Through objective 
#4, we will seek to identify characteristics such as demographics and specifics about the subject’s 
allergy history that may predict a positive response to treatment and in the future allow providers to 
target treatment to appropriate patients.

Version 6.0, March 2, [ADDRESS_469310] will begin the study drug with peanut SLIT at a starting 
dose of 1 pump of a 1/ 100 dilution of peanut concentrate  (2500 mcg peanut protein).  During the 
build-up phase which lasts approximately 2 0 weeks (Table 1), subjects will dose daily and increase 
the number of pumps every 1 -2 weeks as per the dosing schedule.  Subjects return to the research 
unit for observed dosing with each change in peanut SLIT dilution (1/100, 1/10, full concentration) 
and with every other dose increase on fu ll concentration  until the maintenance dose of 16 pumps of 
full concentration peanut SLIT (4000 mcg peanut protein)  is achieved .  Subjects will then continue 
daily administration of the maintenance dose and return every [ADDRESS_469311] 48 months of peanut SLIT study drug, subjects will undergo a second DBPCFC to 
5000 mg of peanut protein to assess desensitization.   
• Subjects who are not desensitized are those who are not able to consume more than the 
MCRT without symptoms, which has been defined as [ADDRESS_469312] peanut avoidance diet.  
 
• Subjects who are able to consume more than [ADDRESS_469313]. 
 
 
2.2 Study Endpoints  
2.2.1 Primary Endpoint   
 
The primary efficacy endpoints are:  
• An estimate of the dose as assessed by [CONTACT_941] 48th month DBPCFC, also called population 
sensitization threshold, predicted to provoke reactions in 5% and 10% of the peanut -allergic 
population.  This will also give population level NOAEL and LOAEL that would define 
interval of consecutive administered dose  levels within which the population sensitization 
threshold lies.  
• Multiplicative or differential change in the population sensitization threshold as assessed by 
[CONTACT_941] 48th month DBPCFC with a unit change in covariates.  
• An estimate of time to  loss of desensit ization for the following events:

threshold.  
-   Subject's true sensitivity threshold to maintain at the same level of LOAEL.  
-   Subject's true sensitivity threshold to drop by [CONTACT_374872].  
-   Subject's true sensitivity threshold to remain at or above MCRT.  
• Estimates of the proport ion of patients at a fixed time for any of the above events that define 
loss of desensitization (bullet 2).  
• Multiplicati ve change in hazard of loss of desensitization  with a unit change in covariates.

5.1 Study Definitions  
 
5.1.1 Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is a generalized allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may progress to death.  
5.1.2 Criteria for Diagnosis   
Anaphylaxis is likely when any one of the three following sets of criteria is fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to hours) with involvement of:  
1.Skin/mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized  hives, itch or flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)   AND 
2.Skin/mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized  hives, itch or flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)   AND 
3.Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia, syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that 
subject (minutes to hours):  
1.Skin/mucosal tissu e (e.g., generalized  hives, itch/flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)  
2.Airway compromise (e.g., dyspnea, stridor wheeze/bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced PEF)  
3.Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia, syncope, incontinence)  
4.Persistent GI symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain)  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to hours):  
1.Infants and Children: low systolic BP (age -specific) or > 30% drop in systolic BP*  
2.Adults: systolic BP < 90 mm Hg or > 30% drop from their baseline  
*  Low systolic BP for children is defined as < 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year; less than (70 
mmHg + [2 x age]) from 1 -10 years; and < 90 mmHg from age 11 -17 years. 
 
5.2 Enrollment  
Up to 55 children may be enrolled  in this protocol, including the participant allowed under an 
exception to enroll from the CoFAR 4 Pro0003579 (not counted in the data analysis for this study) .  
Accounting for a 10% drop out rate, we anticipate having  approximately 45 children eligible for 
randomization during the blinded phase of the study.  
 
5.3 Screening Visit  
The screening visit will include the following procedures:  
1. Consent and assent  – no procedures will occur prior to signed consent.   
2. Diet and allergy questionnaire  
3. Physical examination  
4. Blood draw for peanut-specific IgE measurement  if not already available  
5. Skin prick testing to peanut

Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will return  for a baseline visit.  This baseline visit may be 
combined with the screening visit in subjects whom the study staff believe will qualify for the 
study.  This visit will include the following procedures:  
1. Physical examination  
2. Endpoint titration skin prick test to peanut  
3. Blood draw for mechanistic studies*  
4. Saliva collection  
5. Peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (if capable)

This section defines the types of adverse events that should be reported and outlines the procedures 
for appropriately collecting, grading, recording and reporting them.  
 
6.1 Procedures and Monitoring  
All unexpected serious adverse events related to the experimental procedures will be reported to the IRB, Food Allergy Initiative DSMB, and FDA in a manner consiste nt with 21 CFR 312.32.  All 
other adverse events related to the experimental procedures will also be reported to the IRB and DSMB in an expedited manner if they are Grade 3 and above in severity.  Any participant deaths  
that are likely study related and une xpected would be reported within 24 hours.  The investigator 
will continue to follow or obtain documentation of the resolution course of such an event.  Reactions to study drug dosing will be recorded on a dosing log and will not be reported separately 
as serious adverse events ; allergic symptoms are expected during study drug administration and are 
not unexpected reportable adverse events .  Any reaction that meets the criteria for a se rious adverse 
event will be reported both on the dosing log and on an adverse event case report form.  
 
6.2 Definitions  
6.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)  or Medical Event  
An adverse event is a new, undesirable medical event or occurrence or worsening of an existing condition (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in a subject that occurs during and throughout 
the study, whether or not it is considered to be study relate d.  Adverse events or medical events and 
toxicities are treatment emergent signs and symptoms.   
This includes the following:  
1.AEs not previously observed that emerge during the protocol  participation , including signs or 
symptoms associated with peanut alle rgy that were not pre-existing  
2.Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions  
3.If applicable, AEs that occur prior to study-group assignment associated with medication 
washout, or other protocol -mandated intervention 
4.Preexisting me dical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_13655]. 
Potential adverse reactions seen in subjects receiving  peanut SLIT and subjects unde rgoing 
DBPCFC include the following: skin manifestations such as pruritus, urticaria, or angioedema; respi[INVESTIGATOR_374867], coughing, nasal congestion/rhinorrhea, cough and hoarseness; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhe a, or abdominal pain.  
Anaphylaxis is a potential risk involving any of the above symptoms plus hypotension and circulatory collapse.  
 
6.2.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse therapy experience occurring at any dose th at 
suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution will be defined as an SAE.  This includes, but may not be limited to any of the following events: (This terminology is from

during the protocol -defined follow -up after the study completion whether or not considered 
study related, must be reported.  
2. Life-threatening: Any adverse therapy  experience that places the subject or subjects, in the view 
of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death).  
3. In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318161].  
4. Persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6. An event that required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
 
6.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “unexpected” when its nature (specificity) or severity is not 
consistent with applicable product information, such as safety information provided in the protocol 
or consent.  
 
6.3 Toxicity Grading 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of an AE (as 
in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event 
outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital 
functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.   
Toxicity grades ar e assigned by [CONTACT_374885] -CTCAE version 3.0.  Toxicity grading for allergic reactions including 
anaphylaxis is modified from the NCI -CTCAE system to be more appropriate for thi s study 
population, and is displayed in Appendix 2.  The NCI -CTCAE has been reviewed specifically for 
this protocol and is otherwise appropriate for this study population.  The purpose of using the NCI -
CTCAE system is to provide standard language to descri be toxicities and to facilitate tabulation and 
analysis of the data and assessment of the clinical significance of study drug- related toxicities.  
Adverse events not included in the CTCAE listing should be recorded and graded 1 -5 according to 
the General Gr ade Definition provided below:  
Grade 1 Mild Transient or mild discomforts (< 48 hours), no or minimal  
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374868] (non -prescription or single -use prescription 
therapy may be employed to relieve symptoms, e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_318162], acetaminophen for post -surgical pain).  
Grade 2 Moderate  Mild to moderate limitation in activity some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].

6.3.1 Relationship to Procedure Definitions  
Associated:  There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_374886]/or procedure.  This definition applies to those adverse events that are considered definitely, probably or possibly related to the procedure.  
1. Definitely related:  An AE that follows a temporal sequence from administration of the test 
product and/or procedure; follows a known response pattern to the test article and/or 
procedure; and, when appropriate to the protocol, is confirmed by [CONTACT_374887][INVESTIGATOR_318163] (positive rechallenge: and by [CONTACT_374888] [positive rechallenge]); and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26562]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
2. Probably related:  An AE th at follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test product and/or procedure; follows a known response pattern to the test product 
and/or procedure, is confirmed by [CONTACT_318209]; and cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_82977]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
3. Possibly related:  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal; sequence from administration of 
the test product and/or procedure and follows a known response pattern to the test  product 
and/or procedure, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
4. Not associated:  An AE for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology is 
not related to the test product and/or therapy . 
5. Unrelated : An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence after administration of 
the test product and/or procedure and most likely is explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical disease state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014].  In addition, a negative rechal lenge to the test article 
and/or procedure would support an unrelated relationship.

Version 6.0, March 2, [ADDRESS_469335] been selected based on hypothesized mechanisms of 
clinical desensitization  induction.   
Early data demonstrates that desensitization with peanut SLIT alters both humoral and cellular 
parameters  [23].  We anticipate that peanut SLIT will induce clinical tolerance and SU by [CONTACT_5640] (1) 
a conversion from a Th2 to Th1 immune response or (2) the induction of T Regs or (3) a combination 
of both.  Subjects will be followed for changes in immunologic parameters at baseline and then 
yearly with additional studies at the [ADDRESS_469336]-avoidance SU 
DBPCFC .  Immunologic assays will focus on peanut specific parameters including: 1) basophil 
activation and skin prick testing; 2) humoral studies - specific IgE, IgG, IgG4, and IgA; and 3) 
cellular studies – Treg activation and T cell -stimulated cytokine production.   
Briefly, PBMC’s will be isolated f rom blood drawn at yearly time points and cultured with crude 
peanut extract (CPE) [31], tetanus toxin, and Con A to assess cellular proliferation responses.  A 
control proliferation assay using nonstimulated cells will also be performed.  In addition, cultures will be set up to assess cytokine production by [CONTACT_374889]’s after stimulation with CPE, tetanus toxin, ConA and control.  Culture supernatants will be analyzed yearly for the levels of the following 
cytokines: IFN -γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-β and TNF-α.  Using flow cytometry, we will 
determine the presence of T
Regs in the blood sample each year.  Basophil studies will be performed 
annually to examine activation markers.  Salivary and serum peanut specific antibody levels, 
including IgE, IgG, IgG4, and IgA will be assessed annually. 
7.1 Serum specific IgE, IgG, IgG4, and IgA  
Allergen immunotherapy has been shown to induce ant igen-specific humoral responses.  The 
balance of isotypic response may play a role in allergen sensitivity (e.g., an increase of IgG/ IgE). 
We will collect sera at baseline  and then yearly with additional studies at the  [ADDRESS_469337]-avoidance SU DBPCFC .  Samples will be stored at –80°C.  
Peanut-specific IgE, IgG, IgG4, and IgA levels will be measured using the Phadia ImmunoCAP 100 
instrument (Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Secretory -IgA and IgM in each saliva sample and report the antigen -specific responses as a 
“titer/mcg of total antibody”.  
7.[ADDRESS_469343] -avoidance SU DBPCFC will be cultured in RPMI 1640 
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine.  Cells will be 
cultured in 24 well plates (4 x106/well/ml) in the presence or absence of CPE (200 mcg/ml ), tetanus 
toxin (5 mcg/ml), or Con A (5 mcg/ml).  Supernatants will be collected after 72hrs of culture and 
aliquots will be stored at– 80 °C until analyzed.  IFN -γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, TGF-β, and TNF -α 
levels will be determined either by [CONTACT_374890]’s instructions (R&D 
systems, Minneapolis) or by a Cytokine Bead Array (BD).  The stimulated cells will be collected to 
isolate RNA which will be used to measure GATA -3, T-bet, Foxp3, and Th2 cytokines by [CONTACT_62865].  
7.[ADDRESS_469344] -avoidance SU DBPCFC  will be cultured with CPE (200 
mcg/ml) or media alone and incubated for 7 days.  Cells will be surface stained for CD4 and C D25, 
then intracellularly stained for FoxP3.  The presence of T Regs will be assessed by [CONTACT_4133] 
(CD25+/CD4+/Foxp3+).

dilutions of peanut antigen (100 mcg/ml, 10-1 mcg/ml, 10-2 mcg/ml, 10-3 mcg/ml), anti -IgE 
(1mcg/ml), and media alone.  After 30 minutes incubation, RBCs will be lysed and leukocytes will be fixed and stored frozen for batch mAb staining and flow cytometric analysis of activation markers.  Basophils will be identified as CD123

For full description of s tatistical c onsiderations, p lease refer to the statistical analysis plan .  A 
summary of the plan is described below.   Unless otherwise indicated, all statistical tests will be 2 
sided and tested at a significance level of 0.05.  Corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be 
presented for statistical tests.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_469346], an Interval-Censoring Survival Analysis 
(ICSA) approach will be used to analyze the 48th month DBPCFC threshold data (Collett, 1993, 
Chapter 9, Taylor et al - 2009).  Parametric (Log-normal, Weibull) and non -parametric dose-
distribution model will be used to estimate the ED10 and the ED05, the doses predicted to provoke 
reactions in 10% and 5 %, respectively, of the peanut -allergic population.  Second, for each dose 
interval bounded by [CONTACT_374891] 48th month DBPCFC, we will conduct survival 
analysis with case -1 censoring (Huang – Wellner lecture notes, Kosorok et al, 1998) to est imate 
time to loss of desensitization.  
Sample size was  originally  calculated for 80% power of detecting a p- value of 0.05 considering 2:1 
placebo:peanut SLIT randomization and estimating a 50% pass rate for those randomized to placebo 
versus a 90% pass rat e for those randomized to continue  peanut SLIT  .  Adjusting for an estimated 
10% drop out rate result ed in a minimum required sample size of [ADDRESS_469347].  However, to confirm ou r understanding, we plan on conducting simulations to 
study the power -sample size curve at 80% power based on study assumptions as discussed in the 
statistical methods section  of the statistical analysis plan .  
 
8.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy analyses will be based on the intention to treat ( ITT) population only.  
Continuous endpoints will be analyzed using the Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
analysis.  The mean changes from baseline will be analyzed using a restricted m aximum likelihood 
(REML) based repeated measures approach.  Analyses will include the fixed, categorical effects of 
population source, center and study week as well as the fixed covariates of baseline score and 
baseline score-by -study week interaction.  An  unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within -patient errors.  If this analysis fails to converge, the following structures will be 
tested: first order ante dependence, heterogeneous first order autoregressive, heterogeneous compound symmetry and compound symmetry.  The covariance structure converging to the best fit, 
as determined by [CONTACT_100830]’s information criterion, will be used in the analysis (Mallinckrodt et al,

freedom.

8.2.1 Baseline Characteristics and Demographics  
Summary descriptive statistics for baseline and demographic characteristics will be provided for all 
enrolled participants.  Demographic data will include age, race, sex, body weight, and height; these 
data will be presented in the following manner:

PRACTICE  
11.1 Statement of Compliance  
This study will be conducted using good clinical  practice (GCP), as delineated in Guidance for 
Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance , and according to the criteria specified 
in this study protocol.  Before study initiation, the protocol and the consent documents will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_4215].  Any amendments to the protocol or to the consent 
materials must also be approved before they are implemented.  
11.2 Consent and Assent  Process 
The consent  process is a means of providing information about the study to a prospective participant  
and/or to the  parent/guardian.  The consent process  allows for an informed decision about 
participation in the study.  The participant or the parents/legal guardians will be asked to read, sign, 
and date a consent form before enteri ng the study, undergoing any screening procedures (e.g., 
physical exam, food challenge, skin testing), taking study drug, or undergoing any study -specific

TauTona Pneumoperitoneum Assist Device (TPAD) 
for Laparoscopic Surgery  
 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
January 16, 2024  
1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
a. Brief Summary  
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and ease of use of  a trocar placement 
access  device (TPAD, Tautona) for laparoscopic surgery. [ADDRESS_66510] with Veress needle  insertion (standard 
of care) to obtain access to the peritoneal  cavity. The  device will also be used to guide 
primary trocar placement.  
 
Following induction of general anesthesia, the patient is prepped and  draped in sterile 
fashion.  Local anesthetic is infiltrated at the planned incision site and an  incision is made 
with a scalpel.  These steps are the same in any laparoscopic procedure. Next, the  sterile 
TPAD, which is  connected to a suction source, is centered over the incision, and the  
suction cups activated to  non-invasively grasp the skin. The TPAD is pulled upward, and 
the Veress needle is advanced  through the incision into the peritoneal cavity. Once the 
needle  enters the cavity, the abdomen is  insufflated as per usual standard of care. Once 
insufflated, the  veress needle is withdrawn while  maintaining the TPAD's suction on the 
skin. The primary trocar is  then advanced through the  incision into the abdominal cavity. 
The suction is then released and  the TPAD taken away from  the operating field.  
 
The time needed to obtain laparoscopic access and the time needed for  trocar placement 
will be  recorded. Non -identifiable photos and/or video may be taken of the  TPAD device 
during use.  Acquired digital images may capture a portion of the patient's skin,  however 
if a patient has any  identifying features such as scars or tattoos, these areas will be  
cropped out of the images, or if  this is not possible, no images will be recorded of that 
patient.  There will be no other alterations  to the planned surgery and it will proceed as 
planned. Following  surgery, the surgeon will  complete a questionnaire. Any adverse 
events will be recorded by  [CONTACT_61706].  
 
Patients will undergo routine postoperative care as indicated by  [CONTACT_61707]. no 
additional visits will be required due to their being  enrolled in  the study.  The patient will 
participate in a questionnaire  and may take  non-identifiable photographs of the portion of 
the patients skin where  the TPAD device acts, as described above.  
b. Procedure Risks  
Testing this device in human patients is necessary to establish its  feasibility in a clinical 
setting.  Identifying a safe, quicker method for obtaining peritoneal access  has the 
potential to improve  care for patients.  
c. Use of Deception in the Study  
No deception will be used . 
d. Use of Audio and Video Recordings  
Non-identifiable digital photos and/or videos will be taken of the  TPAD during use and 
post-operatively. Acquired  digital images may capture a portion of the patient's skin, 
however  if a patient has any  identifying features such as scars or tattoos, these areas will 
be cropped out of the images, or if  this is not possible, no images will be recorded of that 
patient.  Images will be kept on an  encrypted, secure server, accessible only to study 
personnel. Some of  these images may be  used for publication or shared with the sponsor 
for providing  instruction for other surgeons. Any  images not used for these purposes will 
be erase.  
January 16, [ADDRESS_66511] treatments will be  withheld  as a result of 
participating in the trial. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], surgeons use a  Veress or  Hasson technique to obtain 
laparoscopic peritoneal access. The risks  and benefits are the same for all laparoscopic 
access techniques. The  benefit of  laparoscopic surgery over open surgery includes 
smaller  incisions/scars, less  postoperative pain and faster recovery, and reduced risk for  
incisional  hernia  
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the 
participant(s) after the conclusion of the study?  
Yes 
g. Study Endpoint (s) 
The study will terminate after [ADDRESS_66512] Experimental and/or Clinical Findings  
Gaining laparoscopic access to the abdomen is a clinical challenge  
due to  
the nature of inserting surgical instruments through small incisions.  
Laparoscopic entry is a blind procedure and thus it is not surprising  
that at  
least 50% of major complications of laparoscopic surgery occur prior  
to the  
commencement of the intended surgery. This complication rate has  
remained stable for the past 25 years. The Hasson technique (open) is  
considered safer, but is more time consuming with an average access  
time 
of 3-10 minutes (Hasson 1999). The Veress technique is a blind  
technique  
that has the advantage of being faster, however carries a risk of  
major  
vascular injury during insertion (Sangrasi et al, 2011). It is  
critical during

a. Investigational Devices  (Including Commercial Devices Used Off -Label)  
Investigational  Device 1  
Name:  [CONTACT_61711] (TPAD)  
Description:  The TPAD can be used to assist in the passage of a Veress Needle to 
establish a pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopic surgical procedures. The 
TPAD can also be used to place the Primary Trocar, once the 
pneumoperitoneum has been achieved. The TPAD is comprised  of 1) a 
pad with suction cups throughout the bottom surface, 2) a port with which 
to connect to a line coming from a sterile central vacuum source (central 
vacuum line), 3) a feature to activate or deactivate the central vacuum 
line, and 4) a handle to ma nipulate the TPAD when suctioned to skin. The 
pad has a middle layer that distributes the vacuum from the central 
vacuum line to each of the suction cups.  
Significant Risk? (Y/N)  No 
Rationale for Non -Significant Risk  The device applies suction via small vacuum powered suction cups to the 
abdominal wall skin. the risk of injury due to use of the device is minimal. 
Peritoneal access is still achieved using a Veress needle, which is the 
standard of care.

8. PARTICIPANT POPULATION  
a. Planned Enrollment  
(i) 30  
(ii) 30  
(iii) participants are patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. The indications for 
laparoscopic surgery are very broad and include appendicitis, gallbladder disease, 
inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and others.  
b. Age, Gender, and Ethnic Background  
Patients >/= 18 years old of any gender and ethnicity will be recruited.  
c. Vulnerable Population s 
Patients who are economically/educationally disadvantaged, homeless, employees or 
students may be candidates to participate in the study. We will make it clear that 
participation is voluntary, that no part of their care is contingent on participating, and that 
there will be no compensation for participating. Decisionally impaired patients will not 
be included. Children and pregnant women will not be included in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
d. Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Populations  
No women or minorities will be excluded from participating. Children will not be 
included in this study as the device is primarily intended for use in adult patients.  
e. Stanford Populations  
We do not aim to recruit any particular number of laboratory personnel, employees 
and/or students. Participants may fall into these categories purely incidentally. All 
participants receive the same written informed consent.  
f. Healthy Volunteers  
There are no healthy volunteers as all participants have a clinical indication for 
undergoing laparoscopic surgery.  
g. Recruitment Details  
The surgeon will identify patients scheduled for laparoscopic surgery from their schedule 
and invite them to participate. if they are agreeable, study staff will be notified by [CONTACT_37040]. The study staff will then meet the patient in the pre -operative area b efore their 
surgery to discuss the study and to obtain consent.

Intra -operative photos/videos taken will similarly be kept on a password protected, 
encrypted server. these images may include a portion of the patient's skin, but this will be 
un-identifiable. If the patient has identifying scars or tattoos, this will be cropped out of 
the images, or, if this is not possible, no images will be stored for that patient. thus, the 
risk of identity exposure from these images is very low.

10. BENEFITS  
We anticipate the TPAD could save anywhere from 1 to 10 minutes of  anesthesia time. the 
patient may therefore benefit from shorter  operative time (shorter duration of anesthesia). There 
could  additionally be significant cost savings with shorter anesthesia. For  example, the average 
cost for running an OR has been estimated at  $62/minute, not counting personnel costs including 
Anesthesia fees.  Therefore, we anticipate the potential for significant time and cost  savings.

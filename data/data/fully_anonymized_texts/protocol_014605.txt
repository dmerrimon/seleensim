Study Design :See schematic below  for study design.
Screening Period:
Eligibility will be based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, medical history , disease activity and safety 
assessments. Randomization must occur within 28 days of signing the informed consent. Subjects that experience an 
acute infection or initiate treatment for latent TB may extend the screening period to 42 days
Treatment Period (Day 1 -Week 24):
On Day 1, subjects w ill be randomized to one of two parallel treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio: 
1.Abatacept SC (125 mg) weekly 
2.Adalimu mab SC (40 mg) once every two weeks
The Treatment Period duration is 24 w eeks.
Abatacept and adalimumab a dministration :
On Day 1, subjects and/or personal caregivers will be trained in self administration of SC injections using pre-filled 
syringes. 
Methotrexate:
Subjects must have been treated with oral methotrexate for at least [ADDRESS_1071809] 28 day s prior to random ization. The stable dose of oral m ethotrexate should be a m inimum  targeted 
Date: 27-Jul-[ADDRESS_1071810] 20 mg weekly. A dose of methotrexate < 20 mg/week but 7.5 mg/week is permitted if intolerance to 
higher doses has been recorded in the source documents.
The dose of methotrexate must remain stable throughout the study, and may only be lowered due to intolerance or 
adverse event . Should intolerance occur and the dose of methotrexate requires reduction, subjects must stay on the 
lower methotrexate dose for the remainder of the study.
Parenteral administration of methotrexate is not perm itted at any time during the study. All subjects must receive 
folic acid, folinic acid, or leucovorin according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Post-Treatment Follow -up Period:
Subjects who discontinue treatm ent of study drug or complete the study will have one follow -up visit [ADDRESS_1071811] to perform safety assessme nts..

and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Revi ew Board/I ndependent Ethics 
Committee (I RB/IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_52194] .
All potential serious breaches must be reported to BMS immediatel y. A serious breach is a 
breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connect ion with the study  or the protocol, 
which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safet y or physical or mental integrity  of the 
subjects of the study  or the scientific value of the study .
Personnel involved in conducting this study  will be qualif ied by [CONTACT_8640], training, and 
experience t o perform their respective tasks.
This study  will not use the services of study  personnel where sanctions have been invoked or 
where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment).
Date: 27-Jul-[ADDRESS_1071821]/Independent Ethics Committee 
Before study  initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_20291]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment material s 
(eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to subje cts. The 
investigator or BMS should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigat or Brochure 
or product labeling information to be provided to subjects and an yupdates. 
The investigator or BMS should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other 
information (eg, expedited safet y reports, amendments, and administrative letters ) according to 
regulatory  requirements or institution procedures.
2.[ADDRESS_1071822] ensure that subjects are clearl y and fully  informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
In situation s where consent cannot be given to subjec ts, their legally  acceptable representatives
(as per country  guidelines) are clearl y and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and 
other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements required by [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
1)Provide a copy  of the consent form and written information about the study  in the language 
in which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study  participation. The language 
must be non- technical and easily  understood. 
2) Allow time necessary  for subject or subject's legally  acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details of the study .
3)Obtain an informed consent signed and personally  dated by [CONTACT_29159]'s 
legally  acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_52223]. 
4)Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_20292], prior to the beginning of the 
study, and after any  revisions are completed for new information.
5)If informed consent is initially  given by a subject’s legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently  becomes capable of maki ng and communicating his 
or herinformed consent during the study , consent must additionally  be obtained from the 
subject.
6)Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The inves tigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study  and of any new information relevant to the 
Date: 27-Jul-[ADDRESS_1071823]'s willingness to continue participation in the study . This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality  of records that could identify  subjects must be protected, respecting the 
privacy  and confidentiality  rules applicable to regulatory  requirements, the subjects' signed ICF 
and, in the US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory  authorities have direct 
access to subject records.
The rights, safet y, and well -being of the study  subjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.

3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy  or bilateral 
oophorectom y) and is not po stmenopausal. Menopause is defined as [ADDRESS_1071841] a serum follicle stimulating hormone, 
(FSH) leve l > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Females treated with hormone replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely  to have artificiall y 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/ml at any time 
during the washout pe riod, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may  require washout periods as long as 6 months.

4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
Double blinding of study drug, adalimumab vis-à- vis abatacept, is not feasible due to logistical 
barriers around re-packaging adalimumab as well as the expected differences in injection site 
reactions. Both of these together make effective blinding of the patients to the randomized drug 
assignment impractical and unsustainable. The nature and frequency  of adalimumab -associated 
injection site reactions make blinding investigators responsible for clinical care unsustainable 
under usual practices. It is possible, however, to preserve the objectivity  of clinical assessments 
with the following strategy  that has been designed to establish and maintain a single -blinded 
assessor for clinical end-points throughout the study .This will require a minimum of 
3individuals: a blinded clinic al assessor, an unblinded Study  Research Coordinator and an 
unblinded phy sician investigator/subinvestigator to complete /approve the CRF.
Clinical Assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation so as to preserve the objectivity  of 
study -related assessme nts (tender and swollen joint count, Physician’s Global Assessment of 
Disease Activity , AE causality  assessment) and routine clinical care (laboratory  result review, 
medication adjustment). To preserve blinding, they must be shielded from treatment allocat ion. 
This will be the responsibility  of the Study /Research Coordinators who need not be blinded to 
treatment allocation. At the beginning of each study  visit throughout the study  duration, the 
subject should be reminded that the Clinical Assessor is blinded to treatment allocation and that 
care must be taken to prevent revealing treatment allocation. They  should be instructed to:
not discuss study  drug by [CONTACT_2300]
not discuss the color or use of the pre -filled sy ringe
not discuss how often injections are performed
only discuss injection site reactions of significant concern .
To comply  with requirements for Case Report Form Completion (CRF) , a qualified physician 
who is an investigator or subinvestigator who is unblinded to study  drug assignment will be 
needed to promptl y review, sign, and date the CRF.
The site should maintain two distinct sets of source documents, one set accessible to the 
unblinded site staff and one set for the blinded Clinical Assessor.
Care should be taken by [CONTACT_71392] /Research Coordinator to retrieve any study  drug and sharps 
container returned by [CONTACT_779791]. Similarly , study  drug dispensin g should be done after 
blinded assessments. Both retrieval and dispensing of study  drug should be done in an area 
shielded from the blinded assessor(s). 
The joint count assessment should be performed after completion of the patient report outcomes 
(PRO), vital sign assessment, and AE assessment. The Clinical Assessor will similarly  be 
reminded at the beginning of each study  visit throughout the study  duration that they are 
performing a blinded- assessment for the study  and to not ask question or elicit comm ents that 
may reveal treatment allocation as outlined above. Every  effort must be made to ensure the same

evaluator(s) will complete the assessment for each subject. If the usual evaluator is not available, 
another trained evaluator blinded to study  drug allocation for the subject may perform the 
clinical assessment. In the event that no blinded evaluator is available during the study  visit, 
blinded clinical assessment measures (tender and swollen joint counts and physician global 
assessment of disease acti vity) should not be reported.
The Sponsor will be unblinded to the treatment assignments of the subject in the trial as it is not 
possible to restrict access to the dosing CRF pages. However, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, 
protocol manager, biomarker repre sentative, and statistician will make every  effort to review 
data in an unbiased fashion. However, theimpact on the study  is believed to be minimal based 
on the primary  objective.
The BMS Bioanaly tical Science Department or its designee will be unblinded to the randomized 
treatment assignments in order to accuratel y perform sample analy sis for the PK and 
immunogenicit y samples.
Unblinding of study  drug allocation for safet y purposes is not necessary  because all study  drug 
provided to the site is open -label ed.

4.8 Destruction of Study  Drug
For this study , study  drugs (those supplied by [CONTACT_52240]) such as 
partially  used study  drug containers, vials and s yringes may be destroy ed on site.
Any unused study  drugs can only be destro yed after being inspected and reconciled by [CONTACT_779792] y destro yed as 
required for safet y, or to meet local regulations ( eg,cytotoxics or biologics).
On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal standards are met:
On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from the drug.
On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any  special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and followed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a cop y provided to BMS upon request.
Records are maintained that allow for traceability  of each container, including the date 
disposed of, quantity  disposed, and identification of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, ie,incinerator, licensed sanitary  landfill, or licensed waste disposal 
vendor must be documented.
Accountability  and disposal records are complete, up-to-date, and available for the Monitor 
to review throughout the clinical trial period.

5.1.1 Retesting During Screening, Extended Screening, or Rescreening
All screening procedures are to be performed within 4 weeks of the randomization visit except as 
described below.
Retesting:
A single retest of the anti-CCP2, RFand hsCRP within the Screening period will be permitted 
(in addition to any  parameters that require a confirmatory  value).
Any new result will override the previous result (ie, the most current result prior to 
Randomization) and is the value by [CONTACT_109419], as it represents the 
subject’s most current, clinical state.
Laboratory  parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 5.1-1, Screening Period,
may be repeated in an effort to find all possible well-qualified subjects. Consultation with the 
Medical Monitor may be needed to identify  whether repeat testing of any particular parameter is 
clinically  relevant.
Extended Screeni ng:
Subjects that experience an acute infection or initiate treatment for latent TB may extend the 
screening period to 42 days, as long as the infection did not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_779783]. Under these circums tances, all screening 
procedures except IVRS enrollment, height/weight, immunoglobulins, urinaly sis, anti -CCP2, RF, 
chest x -ray, TB testing, HepB/C and HIV should be repeated prior to randomization .
Rescreening:
This study  permits the rescreening of a subject that has discontinued the study  as a pre-treatment 
failure (ie, subject has not been randomized / has not been treated), still meets all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and no more than 9months have elapsed prior to enrollment since 
the onset of symptoms of RA. If rescreened , the subject must be re-consented. A subject may be 
rescreened only once. Medical Monitor approval is required and rescreens are not permitted less 
than [ADDRESS_1071862] x-ray, may not need to be repeated if they were performed within the protocol defined 
window.
5.1.2 Order of Stu dy Assessments

5.3.1 Physical Examination
Physical examinations may be performed by a Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Osteopath y 
(DO), Ph ysician Assistant (PA), or Nurse Practitioner (NP).
The physical examination should include examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, the lymph 
nodes, liver, spleen and skin. A physical examination may note any changes in the subject’s 
condition (body  systems) since the last assessment and does not preclude examination of any 
other bod y systems as clinically  indicated.
5.3.[ADDRESS_1071864] x-ray result will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF.
5.3.3 Physical Measurements
Weight and height is to be recorded at screening. Weight will also be recorded at Day 1  and 
Week 24/Earl y Termination.
5.3.4 Vital Signs
Vital signs (seated blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature) will be recorded during every  
office visit and prior to dose administration, when applicable. Blood pressure and heart rate 
should be measured after the subject has been seated quietly  for at least [ADDRESS_1071865]’s eligibility . In addition to a chest x-ray that does not show any evidence or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_779784], a tuberculin skin testwill be performed and interpreted according to local country 
Health Authorities and/or Medical Society  guidelines. Some guidelines have specific 
recommendations for subjects who are to receive biologics or immunosuppressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(eg,RA experience with biologic agents),27,28,29or who are immunocompromised and who have 
had prior BCG vaccination(s).30,31Tuberculin skin testing is not contraindicated for persons who 
have been vaccinated with BCG. An interferon gamma release assay  (eg, QuantiFERONGold 
or Tspot/ELISpot) is an acceptable alternative when skin testing for tuberculosis (ie, [COMPANY_003]) is not 
appropriate.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in aclinical investigation subject administered study  drugand that 
does notnecessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unint ended sign (such asan abnormal laboratory  finding ), sympto m, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The ca usal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] 
(seeNOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.)

Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  
drug is an SAE.
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by [CONTACT_52252], these events must be handled asSAEs.
(See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study  endpoint that is consider ed related to study  therap y (eg,death is an 
endpoint, if death occurred d ue to anaphy laxis, anaphy laxis must be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details ).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52205]:
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life- threatening event)
elective surgery , planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine colonoscop y)
medical/surgical admission other than to remedy  ill health and planned prior to entry  into 
the study . Appropri ate documentation is required in these cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative reason ).
Admission for administration of anticancer therapy  in the absence of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.5.1 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safety  Information to 
determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting . Following the 
subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or not related to 
study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified 
procedures .All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within
85daysof discontinuation of the Treatment Period . If applicable, SAEs must be collected that 
relate to an y later protocol -specified procedure ( eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ). 
Date: 27-Jul-[ADDRESS_1071871] be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous thera py or a complication of a study  
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(ordesignee) within [ADDRESS_1071872] be recorded on the SAE 
Report Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The 
preferred method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF. The paper 
SAE/pregnancy  surveillance fo rms are only  intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system 
is not functioning. In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed 
facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number :Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediately .When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required forSAE and pregnancy  reporting) :Refer to Contact
[CONTACT_20491].
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drug or ifnew information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS 
(ordesignee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonseriou s Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of non serious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Non serious 
AEinformation should also becollected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug andfor those present at the end of study  treatment 
Date: 27-Jul-[ADDRESS_1071873] be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the cours e of the study .
6.[ADDRESS_1071874] result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE
Any laboratory test result abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory test result abnormality  that required the subject to receive specific corrective 
therap y
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by 
[CONTACT_9673] ( eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.[ADDRESS_1071875] immediately  notify  the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form to BMS Designee within [ADDRESS_1071876] cases, the study  drug will be permanently  discontinued in an appropriate manner 
(eg,dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study  drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study  drug after a thorough 
discussion of benefits and risk with the subject .
Protocol -required procedures for study  discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663]  (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.
The investigator must immediately  notify  the BMS (or designee) Medical Monitor of this event 
and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within [ADDRESS_1071877] be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Date: 27-Jul-[ADDRESS_1071878] be

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Specific criteria for identify ing potential DILI have not been identified for this protocol. 
Standard medical practice in identify ing and monitoring hepatic issues should be followed.
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram, x-ray filming ,any other potential safet y assessment required or not required

8.1 Sample Size Determination
In this stud y 25 subjects will be randomized per treatment arm.
This is anexploratory  study with only exploratory  objectives. No formal sample size and power 
calculation will be provided. It should be noted that with 25subjects per arm the half width of 
the 95% CI for differences in proportion (eg, proportion of seroconversion for anti-CCP2, 
ACPA) will range from 25 to 30%. This means that only  if the treatment difference in proportion 
is larger than 25-30% the difference will be declared statisticall y significant at 5% significance 
level. For changes from baseline in continuous variables the minimal detectable effect size 
(treatment difference in changes divided by [CONTACT_779799]) to declare statistical 
significance (with 5 % significance level) is 0.57. 
The population will be enriched to allow for assessment of important changes in the immune 
phenoty pe by  [CONTACT_779800] -CPP2 positive.

Expanded definition Com plete abstinence as defined as complete avoidance of 
heterosexual intercourse is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. This 
also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. This does 
not mean periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, profession of 
abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, post -ovulation methods) and w ithdraw al, which 
are not acceptable methods of contraception. Subjects who choose complete abstinence 
are not required to use a second method of contraception, but female subjects must

Study Title  Enhancing Smoking Cessation in the Homeless 
Population  
Study Design  
The goal of this study is  to enhance smoking 
cessation rates for homeless smokers by [CONTACT_742660] 1) an Intensive Smoking Intervention, and 
2) integrating alcohol abuse treatment with smoking 
cessation. We initially utilize d a 3-group 
randomized design to test study hypotheses . The 
three study conditions were:  1) Integrated Intensive 
Smoking plus Alcohol intervention using cognitive 
behavioral therapy, CBT —(IS+A); 2) Intensive 
Smokin g Intervention using CBT —(IS); or 3) Usual 
Care (brief smoking cessation and brief alcohol 
counseling both based on the USPHS’s 
Guidelines) —(UC). The addition of the alcohol use 
criteria resulted in nearly two -thirds of those 
screened to be deemed ineligib le. Consequently the 
study was revised to eliminate the  Intensive 
Smoking Intervention using CBT —(IS) arm and the 
study period reduced from 52 weeks to 26 weeks to 
improve enrollment into the intensive smoking and 
alcohol and usual care arms. All participants receive 
12-week of treatment with  the nicotine patch plus 
nicotine gum/lozenge. Counselin g follow s the 
protocol used in a recent study of alcohol dependent 
smokers  and include s weekly individual sessions for 
[ADDRESS_1015172] study 
visits scheduled. Primary smoking outcome is 
cotinine -verified 7 -day smoking abstinence at week 
26 follow -up while secondary outcome is prolonged 
smoking abstinence at weeks 12 and 26. Secondary 
alcohol outcome will be s elf-reported continuous 
alcohol abstinence for 90 days at week 26. 
Recruitment and retention will be enhanced by [CONTACT_742661], bus passes, and other non -monetary 
incentives. Participants will be enrolled from 
homeless shelters and facilities in the 7 -county 
greater Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area.  
Primary Objective  Hypothesis 1:  At [ADDRESS_1015173] randomization, 
homeless smokers who receive Integrated Smoking

significantly better biochemically -verified 7 -day 
abstinence rate from cigarette smoking compared to 
those who received Usual  Care (UC).  
Hypothesis 2:  At [ADDRESS_1015174] randomization, 
homeless smokers who receive Integrated Smoking 
plus Alcohol intervention (IS+A) will have 
significantly better 90 -day abstin ence rate from 
alcohol consumption compared to smokers who 
receive Usual Care (UC).  
Exploratory Aim  
Hypothesis 3:  At [ADDRESS_1015175] randomization, 
homeless smokers who receive Intensive Smoking 
Intervention (IS) will have significantly higher 
biochemically -verified 7 -day abstinence rate from 
cigarette smoking compared to those who receive 
Usual Care (UC).  
Secondary Objective(s)  1. To evaluate how smoking cessation or reduction 
relate to psychosocial factors such as levels of 
depression, hopelessness, and pe rceived stress at 
weeks 12 and 26 follow -up 
2. To evaluate how alcohol abstinence or reduction 
relate to psychosocial factors such as levels of 
depression, hopelessness, and perceived stress at 12

3. To evaluate how treatment outcomes relate to 
history of other substance abuse  
4. To evaluate, how treatment outcomes relate to 
opportunities for employment and housing, as well 
as overall health and well -being.  
5. To evaluate participants' perceptions of the 
acceptability and usefu lness of components of the 
various interventions

1.1 Purpose:  
Although the overall prevalence of smoking in the United Sates has 
declined,  rates remain strikingly high ( 70%) in homeless  
populations.  A majority of homeless smokers also abuse alcohol and 
other d rugs which makes quitting more difficult and heightens the 
health consequences of tobacco use.  However, most smoking 
cessation research has excluded this most vulnerable segment of our 
population. Over the past several years, our research team conducted 
studies aimed at reducing tobacco use in homeless populations. The 
first National Institute of Health ( NIH)-funded (R01HL081522; 
Okuyemi, Pl) smoking cessation clinical trial (n=430) targeted  
homeless smokers with 8 -week treatment with nicotine patch and 6 
sessions of motivational interviewing (Ml). This relatively low 
intensity study showed cotinine -verified 7 -day quit rates of 9.3% for 
Ml vs. 5.6% for Brief Advice at 26 weeks. We als o found that 
quitting smoking was associated with reduced alcohol use. These 
smoking quit rates are low compared to the general population, 
demonstrating the challenge for tobacco interventions in this 
population and the need for more research. The goal of  this study  is 
to evaluate interventions designed to enhance smoking cessation 
rates for homeless smokers by [CONTACT_742662] 1) intensive 
smoking intervention (i.e. higher dose and duration than our previous 
R01), and 2) integrating alcohol abuse tr eatment with smoking 
cessation. W e utilize a [ADDRESS_1015176] study 
hypotheses. The study conditions are : 1) Integrated Intensive 
Smoking intervention using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plu s 
Alcohol intervention -(IS+A) and , 2) Usual  Care (brief smoking 
cessation and brief alcohol counseling both based on the US Public 
Health Service's Guidelines) . In addition, all participants receive 12 -
week s of treatment with a combination of nicotine patch plus gum or 
lozenge.  
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significa nce of Research Question/Purpose:  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_742652], there is 
limited empi[INVESTIGATOR_742653]. 
Because quit rates are low in homeless populations it is critical to d evelop 
more powerful interventions for improving cessation rates. Given that the 
majority of homeless smokers also abuse alcohol, a logical next step to 
improve smoking cessation rates in this group is to address their alcohol 
abuse along with a more inten sive pharmacological and behavioral smoking 
cessation intervention.  
2.2 Preliminary Data:

VERSION DATE:  11/15/201 7 
 Page 8 of 25 Revis ed: April 19, 2017  2.3 This study is a follow -up study to the initial study, Power to Quit (PTQ) that 
used a similar study design. An association was noted between smoking 
cessation/reduction and alcohol cessation/reduction. We conducted a 
secondary analysis to examine the association between smoking cessation 
and substance abuse in the PTQ study. Participants with verified abstinence 
at week 26 had greater reduction in alcohol drinking days co mpared to 
participants who did not quit smoking ( -3.8 vs. -0.8; p=0.05). We also 
examined the quit rates at 26 weeks by [CONTACT_742663] 8 weeks among 
the subset that reported drinking alcohol on one or more days at baseline 
enrollment. Alcohol drinke rs at baseline who reported quitting alcohol at 8 
weeks follow -up had higher smoking abstinence rate (10.1%) at week 26 
follow -up compared with those remained drinkers.

homeless smokers who participated in the PTQ study. Working with local 
shelters, a total of 847 adult smokers were scr eened for study eligibility of 
which 580 (68.5%) met eligibility criteria.  Of those eligible, 430 (74.1%) 
returned for randomization. Eligible participants who returned for 
randomization were older and more likely to have a phone number 
compared to eligib le participants who were not enrolled in the study.  
Knowledge of these factors including inclusion and exclusion criteria may 
help researchers tailor criteria that accurately identify and include homeless 
smokers in future clinical trials.

Guidelines) —(UC). A ll participants receive [ADDRESS_1015182] study visits scheduled. Primary smoking 
outcome is cotinine -verified 7 -day smokin g abstinence at week 26 follow -
up while secondary outcome is prolonged smoking abstinence at weeks 12

by [CONTACT_742664], weekly raffles, bus passes, and other non -monetary 
incentives. Participants are enrolled from homeless shelters and facilities in 
the 7 -county greater Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area.  
 
5.2 Study Procedures:  
Participants are recruited at Twin City  area homeless shelter s and service 
organizations serving homeless adults to complete an eligibility survey to 
determine if they meet the eligibility requirements of the study. El igible 
participants are  scheduled for the baseline enrollment visit at which t ime 
study staff explain the study in detail, obtain consent, administer a baseline 
date collection survey and randomize the participant to one of the two study 
arms. Participants are scheduled for weekly data collection surveys and 
counseling sessions for those randomized to the counseling arm for the first 
12 weeks of the study and every other week (14, 16 and 18) and at weeks 22 
and  26.  
In the usual  care, or control, arm, parti cipants receive 12 weeks of NRT 
(nicotine replacement treatment ) and one -time brief (~15 minutes) 
counseling for smoking cessation and alcohol cessation. The smoking 
cessation counseling is based on the 5 A’s model (Ask, Advise, Assess, 
Assist, Arrange) recommended by [CONTACT_742665]. Consistent with the guidelines, counselors conduct the 
following procedures: a) congratulate the participant on enrolling in the 
study, b) describe the harms related to smoking and the benefits of quitting, 
c) advise the participant to quit immedia tely, d) assist participants to set a 
quit date, e) encourage participants to tell friends and families about their 
quitting, and f) describe potential relapse situations and other barriers to 
quitting. The brief alcohol counseling follow s Public Health Se rvice 
guidelines and include elements such as a) presenting screening results, b) 
identifying risks, c) discussing consequences, d) soliciting commitment, e)

VERSION DATE:  11/15/201 7 
 Page 12 of 25 Revis ed: April 19, 2017  identifying goals, and f) giving advice and encouragement. At the end of the 
session, participants  interested in additional smok ing or alcohol intervention 
are referred to local and national treatment programs.  
Participants in intensive integrated smoking and alcohol  counseling 
condition receive 12 weeks of NRT treatment plus weekly individual 
cessatio n couns eling sessions. Counseling utilize CBT (cognitive behavioral 
therapy) techniques. The counselor assist s participant to set and prepare for 
their quit date targeted for the day after randomization. Initial CBT sessions 
focus on identifying situations , activities, moods, and thoughts associated 
with cigarette smoking, strategies for copi[INVESTIGATOR_742654], etc.  Counseling is also be tailored to address challenges 
peculiar to homeless persons including boredom, lack of structure i n daily 
life, and dealing with the stress related to meeting competing social needs 
(e.g. food, housing, safety, grooming, etc.). The remaining sessions focus on 
relapse prevention. This protocol was used in a recent study by [CONTACT_742666].  
The alcoho l counseling is distinct from smoking counseling and does not 
emphasize similarities between quitting smoking and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_742655]. This is based on findings from a study that reported that 
emphasizing these similarities led to worse drinking outcomes compared to 
concurrent treatment that did not emphasize the similarities. Alcohol 
treatment is based on a CBT manual developed for Project MATCH, an [ADDRESS_1015183] to assess  cognitive concerns in the areas of orientation, memory, and 
concentration.  Additionally, at each study visit participants are assessed for 
suicidal ideation. The Columbia Suicide  Severity Rating  Scale  is 
administered anytime a participant answers affirmatively to the question: 
“over the last [ADDRESS_1015184]?” If the 
result of the Columbia indicate s they have intention or a plan, they are

 Study procedures are expected to end by [CONTACT_933] 20, 2018 and data 
analysis before study end  on March 31, 2019.  
9.0 Study Population  
9.1 Inclusion Criteria:  
The study population is homeless adults who smoke cigarettes  and drink 
alcohol . Homeless individuals are considered  to be undervalued, often 
disenfranchised and are vulnerable due to their disadvantage in the 
distribution of social goods and services including income, housing, and 
healthcare. This study specifically targets homeless to learn how to address 
the healthcare disparities they face  with lack of access to smoking cessation 
interven tions and lack of research identifying successful smoking cessation 
strategies that work for homeless individuals wishing to quit smoking.  
 
Individuals must meet the following criteria to be considered for study 
inclusion:  
• Currently homeless  (as defined in the  Stewart B. McKinney Act passed by 
[CONTACT_742668] 1987 ) 
• Smokes > [ADDRESS_1015187] 7 days  
• Smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime  
• AUDIT score ≥5  
• Aged 18 years or older  
• Willing to attend study sessions and follow other study protocol  
9.2 Exclusion Criteria:  
Individuals will be excluded for the following reasons:  
• Use of smoking cessation medications or interventions in last 30 days  
• Unstable medical illness that requires immediate medical care  
• AUDIT score <5 or >27  
• Pregnancy or other NRT contraindications  
• Current history or in past [ADDRESS_1015188] 3 months (as 
determined by [CONTACT_243116])  
• Cognitive impairment (as measured  by [CONTACT_742669])  
9.3 Screening:  
To make screening and participation convenient for participants, al l study visits 
occur at local homeless shelters. Interested individuals complete an eligibility 
survey administered by [CONTACT_742670] y are eligible to enroll. The 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Enhancing Smoking Cessation in the Homeless Population  
VERSION DATE:  11/15/201 7 
 Page 15 of 25 Revis ed: April 19, [ADDRESS_1015189] will be 
administered to determine cognitive capacity to participate. The 7 -item Psychotic 
Disorders and Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features scale of the Mini 
International Neu ropsychiatric Interview (MINI) is administered to screen for 
psychotic disor ders. Those who screen positive for psychotic disorders or major 
depression may be enroll ed provided they have been stable in treatment for past 
three months. This determination is be made by [CONTACT_742671], [CONTACT_742683],  who oversee s screeni ng and necessary referrals for these psychiatric 
disorders. To be enrolled in the study, pa rticipants  must be able to meet study staff 
at designated homeless shelters. Individuals may screen for eligibility up to five 
times with a minimum one month window between screenings. This allows those 
deemed ineligible due to unstable medical conditions the ability to potentially 
enroll once their health is stable. E ligible individuals are scheduled for a follow -up 
visit to enroll and be randomized to a study condit ion.   
10.0 Vulnerable Populations

10.2 Adults lacking capacity to consent and/or adults with dimin ished capacity to 
consent:  
Justification for inclusion of population:  
The study specifically targets homeless adult men and women some of 
whom are mentally ill, chemically dependent, members of a minority racial 
and/or ethnic group,  and clearly from economically and often educationally 
disadvantaged populations. The specific aims of the study are to identify 
effective methods to assist homeless individuals interested in quitting 
smoking and drinking alcohol with the understanding tha t methods that are 
effective in the general public may not be effective with individuals facing 
the challenges of homelessness as well the life challenges contributing to 
their homelessness - mental illness, substance abuse, structural racism, and 
lack of economic resources and education.  
The study has numerous validated assessments that are administered  as part 
of the eligibility screening process and the weekly data collection survey 
process that assess for ability and competency to enroll in the study and to 
maintain participation once enrolled. Assessments include assessing for 
cognitive ability  (Shor t Blessed Test) , alcohol withdrawal  (Clinical Institute 
Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Use, Revised) , physical health  
(documentation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_742657]) , mental health  
(PHQ -9, MINI Anxiety, MINI Psychotic Symptoms ), suicidal ideation  
(Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale) , current alcohol use and 
breathalyzer testing to ensure potential and current participants are capable 
and able to enroll and participate in the study tasks.  
We minimize the risks by [CONTACT_742672] s at eligibility 
screening and at each study session to ensure that at each study visit the 
participant is coherent, medically and psychologically stable, and not 
impaired by [CONTACT_742673].   
 
10.3 Additional Safeguards:  
The study does not enrol l pregnant women, does not involve neonates, 
prisoners or individuals under the age of 18.  
11.0 Local Number of Participants  
11.1 Local Number of Participants to be Consented:  
We plan to enroll a minimum of 428 to allow data analysis with a maximum 
enrollment of 64 5 participants.  
 
12.0 Local Recruitment Methods  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Enhancing Smoking Cessation in the Homeless Population  
VERSION DATE:  11/15/201 7 
 Page 17 of 25 Revis ed: April 19, 2017  12.1 Recruitment Process:  
Study participants are recruited from homeless shelters and facilities in the 
Minneapolis/St Paul area that serve homeless adults. Homeless shelters 
include Dorothy Day Center, Salvation Army Harbor Light, United Gospel 
Mission, Naomi Family Center, Emma Norton Center, Our Savior’s Shelter, 
St. Stephen’s Shelter, and Simpson House. Organizations serving homeless 
adults include the Catholic Charities Opportunity Centers, Listening House, 
the Vet eran’s Service Center , Hennepin and Ramsey County detoxification 
centers, Sharing and Caring Hands, Higher Ground and the Hennepin 
County Healthcare for the Homeless program s. Recruiting from multiple 
homeless shel ters and service providers make the study more accessible for 
participants and ensure s a more representative sample.  
Study staff post recruitment flyers with tear -off tabs that contain the study 
phone number and email and hand out half -page flyers to individuals who 
express interest  in the study  the above -listed site s. 
12.2 Source of Participants:  
Participants are recruited from homeless shelters and organizations 
providing services to homeless adults through face -to-face contact  [CONTACT_742674] l addres s to contact 
[CONTACT_1758].  
12.3 Identification of Potential Participants:  
Potential participants self -identify in response to posters and to the study 
staff during outreach at selected sites. Interested individuals complete an 
eligibility survey that is administer ed by [CONTACT_742675].  
12.4 Recruitment Materials:  
The study uses two types of print materials to recruit. One is a full page (8 
½” x 11”) poster with tear -off tabs at the bottom. These are posted o n the 
walls of various homeless shelters and service organizations that serve 
homeless adults. The other is a half -sheet (8 ½” x 5 ½”) flyer that is handed 
to individuals expressing an interest in the study at the various homeless 
shelters and service orga nizations that serve homeless adults (as listed in 
12.1 above).  
12.5 Payment:  
Participants are compensated at each study visit they attend. Compensation 
varies depending on the time the visit is expected to take and the data that is 
collected at that visit. Co mpensation includes gift cards (Visa and/or 
American Express) and small incentives. Incentives include bus tokens, 
backpacks, pocket calendars, water bottles, note pads, word find book 
games, Subway gift cards ($5), and playing cards. Participants are also  
offered a raffle draw during the first 12 weeks of the study when the study 
treatment (nicotine replacement treatment) is administered  and at weeks 16

chances) , $[ADDRESS_1015190] gift cards  (40 chances) and $10 gift cards  (10 
chances) . Compensation is given at the end of each study visit the 
participant attends. Over the course of the study participants can earn up to 
$285 in Visa or American Express gift cards and incentives valued at up to  
$145 for a total of $430 in total compensation in addition to small raffle 
winnings. Payments are given only to the study participant, and there are no 
research experience points awarded . 
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:  
Participants m ay be withdrawn from the research without their consent if 
they harass or otherwise intimidate staff with threats  of physical or sexual 
violence.  
13.2 Withdrawal Procedures:  
Participants may voluntarily withdraw from the study if they find they are 
no longer interested in participating or if they will otherwise be unable to 
continue participation. Those who voluntarily withdraw can return and 
continue their participation at any point in the future during the [ADDRESS_1015191] the area for a job, family , 
or other reason but return and continue participation . When returning, they 
will re -enter the study at the week they would be at if they had participated 
continuously. Each study visit has a window of time before and afte r the 
ideal date of their visit. Study visits can only be completed during the visit 
window.    
13.3 Termination Procedures:  
There is not a procedure for voluntary withdrawals. Those terminated 
involuntarily are notified in writing at a scheduled meeting to provide the 
written termination letter and any compensation that may be due to them.  
14.0 Risks to Participants  
For each risk or set of risks below, include the procedures to be performed to 
lessen the probability, magnitude, duration, or reversibility of those  risks.  
14.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
There are some risks related to quitting smoking that a participant may 
experience while in the study. These may include headaches, being 
uncomfortable, changes in mood, weight gain, and the possibility of going 
back to smoking.  Possible side effects of the nicotine patch may include 
skin irritation or rash and problems with sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. These are generally mild 
and stop after a few days of using the patch.  
 
Participants are asked by [CONTACT_742676]:  Enhancing Smoking Cessation in the Homeless Population  
VERSION DATE:  11/15/201 7 
 Page 19 of 25 Revis ed: April 19, 2017  their ability to use the patch. Participants are given a specific phone number,  
(612) [ADDRESS_1015192]. Okuyemi. 
Participants will be prompted to discuss any side effects during follow -up 
visits and will be given the study office phone number (24 -hour coverage) to 
contact [CONTACT_85602]/or the investigators to report adverse events. We 
follow the NIH guidelines for reporting adverse events to the IRB. Any 
problems needing medical attention will be referred to [CONTACT_742684] and the 
Health Care for the  homeless clinics in Minneapolis and St. Paul which are 
federally qualified community health centers that provide medical care and 
social services for homeless persons. The patch is discontinued in patients 
who become pregnant or develop a contraindication . Patients are instructed 
not to smoke cigarettes during nicotine treatment therapy. Due to the high 
prevalence of psychiatric and substance abuse co -morbidities in homeless 
populations, in the proposed study we expect to encounter participates who 
have on e or more of these co -morbidities. It is also possible after enrolling 
in the study for some participants to develop these co -morbid disorders. 
Counselors are trained to identify such participants and the study 
psychiatrist directly oversee s the protocol’s  implementation. For each case 
the psychiatrist  also make s a determination as to whether the participant is 
mentally stable enough to continue participation in the study.  
 
There are also some risks from stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_545522], however, the study 
screens out heavy alcohol users to avoid enrolling those at risk for 
experiencing alcohol withdrawal . Additionally at every study session 
alcohol use is measured with an alcohol breathalyzer test and the 
administration of the CIWA, an alcohol withdrawal assessment scr een to 
ensure a participant is not intoxicated or in alcohol withdrawal. If the CIWA 
indicates an individual is experiencing alcohol withdrawal, study staff walk 
the person to the on -site medical clinic for further evaluation.  
 
14.2 Reproduction Risks:  
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not allowed to enroll in the 
study because of possible harms the nicoti ne patch could cause to the fetus . 
Women of childbearing age must take a urine pregnancy test to ensure they 
are not pregnant, and if not pregnant must agree to use an effective method 
of preventing pregnancy while using nicotine patch. Women are instructed 
to report to staff should they become pregnant while using the nicotine patch 
and to immediately stop using the patch.

PROTOCOL TITLE:  Enhancing Smoking Cessation in the Homeless Population  
VERSION DATE:  11/15/201 7 
 Page 20 of 25 Revis ed: April 19, 2017  15.1 Potential Benefits:  
Anticipated benefits of alcohol and tobacco cessation outweigh the minimal risks 
associated with the nicotine replacement therapy and counseling.  Given their 
already compromised health status, homeless smokers who abuse alcohol 
are at an extremely high risk of synergistic health effects of tobacco and 
alcohol. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_742658], limited empi[INVESTIGATOR_742659]. The current applicati on therefore breaks new ground 
by [CONTACT_742677] -based treatments to a vulnerable 
population. The prevalence of cigarette smoking among alco hol dependent 
persons is up to 7 0%, more than three time s the rate in general population. 
In addition to high prevalence of tobacco use in homeless populations, the 
rates of alcohol and drug abuse ar e also high  in this population. Cigarette 
smokers drink alcohol more often and more heavily than nonsmokers. 
Studies have shown that the health consequences of chronic alcohol and 
tobacco use are synergistic. In one study of 4,928 alcoholics, the high cancer 
mortality was attributed solely to smoking. Another study by [CONTACT_742678]. 
found a 48% cumulative mortality at 2 0 years after inpatient alcohol 
treatment attributable more to tobacco -related diseases than to alcohol.   
16.0 Data Management  
16.1 Data Analysis Plan:  
The primary analysis will be based on an intention to treat (ITT) analysis, 
i.e., participants will be analyzed in  the treatment to which they were 
randomized. The intervention effects for  the primary outcomes of week 26  
biochemically verified 7 -day abstinence from cigar ette smoking (Hyp 1) and 
week 26  90-day abstinence from alcohol consumption (Hyp 2) will be tested 
using Chi -square tests. Any participants lost to follow -up will be classified 
as treatment failures (i.e. smoker or drinker). Bonferroni procedures will be 
used to control for experimentwise Type I error rate. Abstinence rates and 
corresponding 95% confide nce intervals will be estimated and summarized 
using appropriate tabular and graphical methods. Supportive analyses will 
examine baseline variables including demographic (age, sex, income, 
education), nicotine dependence, withdrawal symptoms, motivation an d 
confidence, self -efficacy, social support, perceived stress, and depressive 
symptoms in terms of their relationship to study outcomes. Analyses 
accounting for these measures will be conducted using multiple logistic 
regression including intervention grou ps as controlled factors. Thus we can 
assess whether the main conclusions from the primary analysis are robust 
for the inclusion of these baseline variables. For hypothesis 3, Fisher exact 
test will be used to compare the biochemically verified 7 -day smoki ng 
abstinence  rates at week 26  follow -up between the participants who receive 
the Intensive Smoking intervention (IS) and participants who receive Usual 
Care (UC). Supportive analysis will be conducted using multiple logistic 
regression including the inter vention group as predictor adjusting baseline 
covariates to assess whether the result from secondary analysis is robust for 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Enhancing Smoking Cessation in the Homeless Population  
VERSION DATE:  11/15/201 7 
 Page 21 of 25 Revis ed: April 19, 2017  the inclusion of baseline covariates. Analyses for exploratory aims: To 
examine how smoking cessation, alcohol abstinence, smoking r eduction, 
and alcohol reduction at weeks 12, 26, and 52 follow -up relate to the 
psychosocial factors, such as level of depression, hopelessness, and 
perceived stress, other substance abuse, opportunities for employment and 
housing and overall health, separ ate repeated measures logistic regressions 
with generalized estimating equations (GEE) or linear mixed models that 
accounts for the repeated measures structure of the data will be used to 
examine the associations between each individual psychosocial predic tors 
and smoking or alcohol outcomes at weeks 12, 26, and 52 follow -ups. 
Interactions terms between these factors and intervention indicators will be 
further tested in the above models. Model validation will use analytic and 
graphical techniques to check a ssumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, 
multivariate normality, and independence of residuals. Descriptive statistics 
will be used to summarize and ANOVA or Chi -square tests will be used to 
examine participants’ perceptions of acceptability and usefulne ss of 
components of the various interventions.

Background/Problem Statement  
 
Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is an accepted therapy for refractory urinary urgency and frequency, 
urgency urinary incontinence, non -obstructive urinary retention, and fecal incontinence1. A common 
indication  for SNM is overactive bladder (OAB). OAB is defined as a syndrome of urinary urgency, 
usually accompanied by [CONTACT_575358], with or without urgency urinary 
incontinence, in the absence of infection or other pathology .[ADDRESS_755274] medications. However, long -term 
adherence to these interventions is poor due to sid e effects and poor effectiveness .4  
Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is a third -line treatment option for OAB that can have a 
particular impact on this population  and success rates as high as 82% can be expected at [ADDRESS_755275] stimulation followed by [CONTACT_575359]/pulse generator placement if successful. Successful test stimulation is defined as a 
reduction of one or more micturition symptoms of ≥50% compared to baseline.  Test 
stimulation can be performed as a staged procedure  in the operating room or as a  percutaneous 
sacral nerve evaluation  (PNE ) performed in the office. Though a patient is anesthetized in the 
operating room, discomfort with placement is a larger concern with  office based  PNE  procedures  
– making increased comfort  with this procedure essential.  
Page 4 of 17 
Version Date:  Lidocaine is frequently used for analgesia with PNE placement. This is often performed with 
injectable lidocaine , however, other forms can be con sidered to improve  patient comfort and 
clinical success  – namely through topi[INVESTIGATOR_20850].  Up to 5% (35 mg) of lidocaine 
patch es are absorbed topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], producing analgesia with in [ADDRESS_755276] adverse sensation more 
sensitively in the office may also make this method of analgesia  more effective.  
 
Objectives  
Primary outcome will be : 
• VAS pain scores measured on a 10 point scale  before and after  PNE procedure  
Secondary outcomes will be:  
• Patient Overall  Satisfaction  after PNE placement  
• Volume of injectable lidocaine  used  
• Rate of successful PNE  
• Progression to permanent  SNS implantation .  
• Amplitude of perineal stimulation

Our null hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference in change in VAS score 
between patients in the lid ocaine patch group and the patients in the control group . 
 
We hypothesize that patients in the lidocaine patch group will experience significantly less 
pain at the time of PNE as measured by [CONTACT_575360].  
 
Study Design/Methodology  
Patients who have been scheduled for a PNE procedure  will be will be consented for the study on 
the day of the procedure  and screened for participation prior to the procedure  by [CONTACT_31813] e. 
Participants will be randomized with a stratified block randomization scheme (with a random 
block size of 4, 6, and 8 participants) . Randomization sequence will be generated by [CONTACT_575361]. All data will be recorded in the RedCap software  and be maintained in that 
password -protected format until analysis.  Data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_575362] . De-identified data will also be sent to statistician 
collaborator for analysis . The tr ial is powered to detect a change in VAS pain score of 1.[ADDRESS_755277] been 
enrolled in the study.   Sample size was determined using G*Power  so that we have 80% power 
to detect a difference between groups of the minimum clinically meaningful effect size of 1.5

score of 1.5 points.    
 
Inclusion criteria :  
1. Female patients undergoing  sacral neuromodulation for the management of their OAB  
with SMN trial with PNE without fluoroscopy . 
2. No contraindication to the use of lidocaine patch  
3. Age >18 years old  
 
Exclusion criteria   
1. Patients who are not candidates for SNM therapy  
2. Patients with contraindication to SNM including pregnan cy 
3.  Allergy to lidocaine or adhesive s  
4. Chronic pain as an indication for the PNE procedure  
 
Study design  
The s tudy design will be a double -blind randomized control trial comparing  4% lidocaine patch 
placed over the sacrum 30 minutes  prior to the procedure to placebo patch . Intervention and 
control patches will be in envelopes  labeled with study number and located within the 
procedure area.  A patch  from the envelope corresponding to the patient  will be placed by a 
medical assistant or co -investigator who is not associated with the PNE placement procedure 
30 minutes  prior to the procedure start. Number of voids and incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_575355] 7 of 17 
Version Date:  prior  to the PNE procedure will be recorded. A patch  (intervention or control)  will be removed  
by a medical assistant prior to provider entering the room  in order to secure blinding . 1% 
lidocaine   will be injected into the sacral procedure site for adequate pain relief. P NE p rocedure 
will then be performed.  If inadequate analgesia  is reported by [CONTACT_575363] , 
additional injectable lidocaine will be administered, not to exceed  4.5 mg/kg of injectable 
lidocaine.  The volume of injectable lidocain e used will be recorded . VAS pain score s prior to an d 
immediately after procedure  will be recorded.  Patient  Satisfaction  Score , rate of successful PNE, 
rate of progression to SNS implantation, and amplitude of perineal stimulation of a Likert scale  
will be collected  immediately after the procedure . 
Patient s will follow up  in 1 week – as is standard of care with the PNE procedure. Adverse 
events such as pain  or change in sensation will be recorded . Number of voids  and incontinence 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] p er day after the PNE procedure will be recorded.  Overall satisfaction score will be 
recorded at that time.

Participant  Recruitment Methods  
Subjects will be recruited from the ULP Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery 
(FPMRS) practice at the University of Louisville Health Care Outpatient Center (HCOC), 
Urogynecology Associates office at [ADDRESS_755279] the study 
explained to them, the consent reviewed, and questions  addressed  in a confidential manner in 
a private room. At the time of consent, participants will be informed that their participation in 
this research is voluntary and that they may discontinue participation without penalty at any 
time. Participants will not be reimbursed for their participation in this resear ch study.  
 
 
Informed Consent  Process  
Patients will be called prior to their procedure to assess if they are interested in participation in 
this study. If they are interested, they will present with sufficient time prior to their procedure 
Page 10 of 17 
Version Date:  to review and sign their consent form and have their patch (lidocaine vs placebo) placed  (in 
place for 30 minutes) . Consent form is otherwise attached.  
 
Research Procedures  
Please see study design/methodology section  for further details . In addition all members of the 
research team will be educated on the study protocol at a division meeting or meeting set up 
for training purposes.  All members of the research team will be able to ask questions at this 
education session and after the education session to ensure they are comfortable with all 
aspects of the study protocol. Members of the research staff that will be using REDCap 
(Research Electronic Data Capture) will be trained on how to use this database.  
 
 
Minimizing Risks  
Potential risk of breach of confidentiality will be mitigated by [CONTACT_575365]. No one other 
than study investigators will be able to access data and it will be deleted at the conclusion of 
the study. Patient will be assigned a study number during the consent process and it will be 
associated with a patient identifier in REDCAP. No other location will have this information.  
 
As this study is minimal risk there will not be oversight of the data. As this drug is available over 
the counter and is not investigational , it will be placed in envelopes at the start of the study and 
dispensed by [CONTACT_575366].

All expected adverse events are of mild severity.  
For this study, the following standard adverse event (AE) definitions are used:  
• Adverse event: Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is 
considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.  
• Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  Any AE related to the study drug that results in any of the 
following circumstances:  death, life -threatening, event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226526], persistent or significant disability/incapac ity 
 
AEs are graded according to the following scale:  
• Mild: An experience that is transient and requires no special treatment or intervention.  The 
experience does not generally interfere with usual daily activities.   
• Moderate: An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments. The 
experience impacts usual daily activities.   
• Severe: An experience that require therapeutic intervention. The experience interrupts 
usual daily activities. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is required for 
treatment of something related to the study drug, it becomes a SAE.  
 
The study uses the follow AE attribution scale:  
Page 12 of 17 
Version Date:  • Not related: The AE is clearly not related to the study procedure (i.e., another cause of the 
event is most plausible and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with 
the onset of the event).  
• Possibly related: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the initiation 
of study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other 
factors.  
• Related: The AE is clearly related to the study procedures.  
 
Expectedness of Adverse Events:  
• Uncommon: discomfort over the area the lidocaine patch was placed and discomfort with 
the PNE procedure itself  
• Rare: Allergy to adhesive bandage or lidocaine, lidocaine toxicity  
 
Plan for Analysis of Results  
Summary statistics for demographics, procedures variables, and outcome measures will be 
summarized for each treatment group (lidocaine patch and control patch) using means, 
standard deviations, counts and proportions, as appropriate.  Differences in these variables will 
be assessed using the two -sample t -test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for 
categorical variables.  A two -sample t -test will be used to assess differences in the primary 
outcome of  change in  VAS score after procedure betwe en groups.  Differences in secondary 
outcomes will be considered using the two -sample t -test for continuous variables and the 
Page 13 of 17 
Version Date:  Fisher exact test for categorical variables.  Transformations and/or non -parametric methods 
will be used if continuous data are found to substantially violate the assumption of approximate 
normality.  Multivariate linear/logistic regression models may be u sed to assess the impact of 
other variables onto primary or secondary outcomes.  Throughout, a significance level of 
α=0.05 will be used, and all tests will be two -sided.   Data analysis will be performed by a 
biostatistician collaborator using the R statis tical software.

2PRÉCIS 
Background:
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of non-relapse morbidity and 
mortality in persons after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). 
Approximately 50% of patients with cGVHD have disease refractory to systemic corticosteroids; 
currently, there is no standard second-line therapy.
The JAK-STAT pathway relays the signaling function of several inflammatory cytokines that 
have a role in GVHD (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12).
Murine models have demonstrated activity of JAK inhibitors in graft-versus-host disease.
Baricitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that has demonstrated anti-
inflammatory effects and a good safety profile in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but has not 
been evaluated in GVHD.

To determine the safety and tolerability of baricitinib in patients with cGVHD that is refractory 
to steroids

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 STUDY O BJECTIVES
1.1.1 Primary Objectives:
To determine the safety and tolerability of baricitinib in patients with cGVHD that is 
refractory to steroids
To determine the efficacy of baricitinib in patients with cGVHD that is refractory to 
steroids
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives:
To determine the efficacy of baricitinib on patient reported outcomes in patients with 
steroid-refractory cGVHD
To determine impact of baricitinib on the immune system and inflammatory markers
To describe pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of baricitinib in patients with 
cGVHD
1.[ADDRESS_577301] disease (cGVHD) is an important late complication of allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation.  It is a leading cause of mortality in patients who are more 
than 2 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT).1,[ADDRESS_577302] been in the range of 
36% in recent years, and has been significantly rising compared to previous time periods,3 and 
can depend on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29039], donor type, graft type, graft manipulation or donor lymphocyte 
infusions.4  Chronic GVHD is strongly associated with prior acute GVHD (aGVHD).5,[ADDRESS_577303] proposed two main GVHD categories, each with two subcategories: (1) 

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/2022
8“classic” aGVHD occurring within [ADDRESS_577304] and (2) “persistent, recurrent or late” 
aGVHD.  The broad category of cGVHD includes: (1) “classic” cGVHD (without features or 
characteristics of aGVHD), and (2) an “overlap syndrome” with concordant features of cGVHD 
and aGVHD.[ADDRESS_577305].7,8 
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of cGVHD is  poorly understood.  T- (Th1, Th17, Thf) and B-cells play a 
role in the pathogenesis of cGVHD, suggesting a general loss of tolerance, including 
abnormalities in the function of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) 9,10.  Natural Tregs 
(CD4+,CD25+,FoxP3+) maintain self-tolerance.10,[ADDRESS_577306], involvement of thymus-dependent pathways in cGVHD 
development begins with injury to the thymus from a chemotherapy-conditioning regimen or 
aGVHD.  Loss of B-cells with the ability to produce antibodies and to present antigen is also 
involved in the pathophysiology and may enhance development of cGVHD.  Autoantibodies like 
anti-nuclear, anti-mitochondrial, anti-parietal, anti–smooth muscle and anti–parotid are present in 
persons with cGVHD.21,[ADDRESS_577307] platelet-derived growth 
factor receptor (PDGFR) may play a role in cGVHD.23  These PDGFR-α autoantibodies 
stimulate thyrosine phosphorylation in a cascade of events contributing inflammation and 
fibrosis. 
There are studies that also report elevated levels of BAFF (B-cell activating factor of the TNF 
family), which is produced by T-cells and granulocytes.  BAFF supports differentiation and 
survival of normal B-cells in persons with cGVHD and autoimmune diseases.12,[ADDRESS_577308] in cGVHD.27  
Clinical manifestations

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/[ADDRESS_577309]. Examples of diagnostic skin manifestations are sclerotic features and 
poikiloderma, lichen-type and hyperkeratotic plaques in the mouth or bronchiolitis obliterans in 
lung biopsy.4  The clinical manifestations of the disease are reminiscent of the autoimmune 
diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjögren syndrome.  
According to the NIH consensus global scoring system, cGVHD is categorized as mild, 
moderate or severe.  Systemic immune-suppressive therapy is usually indicated in persons with 
cGVHD involving 3 or more organs or with a severity score of 2 or higher in any organ.  
Systemic therapy is also to be considered in persons with thrombocytopenia (platelets 
<100x109/L) or progressive onset during prednisone treatment.5  Chronic GVHD eventually 
leads to impaired functional performance, deteriorating quality of life, increased risk of 
infections and death.28-31 
Treatment
Initial therapy for cGVHD is well established consisting of prednisone with or without a 
calcineurin inhibitor.  However, only about 50% of persons have a durable response.11,[ADDRESS_577310] recommendations for second-line treatment of cGVHD and about 75% of 
patients fail treatment.[ADDRESS_577311] of poorly standardized phase 2 trials or 
retrospective case analyses.32  Diverse drugs (about 40 are described) are used, including 
sirolimus, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, methotrexate, extracorporeal photopheresis, monoclonal 
antibodies, pentostatin, imatinib, low dose IL-2, and others. The decision for which drug to use is 
based on logistics, cost, failed prior treatments, toxicity profile and subject or clinician 
preferences.
For many years, cGVHD has been difficult to address because of the lack of standardized criteria 
for diagnosis, staging and response to therapy.  In 2004, as an effort of the NIH-sponsored 
Consensus Development Project, a series of guidelines were published to address diagnosis and 
staging, histopathology, biomarkers, assessment of response to therapy, ancillary therapy, 
supportive care and the design of clinical trials.(2005 NIH consensus papers).34  These were 
recently updated based on evidence from prospective validations (2014 NIH consensus papers).35  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], cGVHD usually lasts 2 to 5 years, and approximately 85% of survivors are able to 
discontinue systemic immune suppression.  Five-year survival rates for patients with cGVHD 
ranged from 72%, 52%, and 25% in patients with low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively, 
using a Center for Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) risk score.36  Treatment 
goals in management of cGVHD include both alleviation of symptoms and the control and 
reversion of the destructive immunological process.  Therapy for cGVHD is largely 
unsatisfactory and persons should be treated on investigational clinical protocols whenever 
possible.29
1.2.2 JAK inhibition in cGVHD
JAK inhibitors are agents that block the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcriptional 
factor (STAT) pathways, which are involved in the signaling function of many inflammatory 
cytokines and ultimately impact T-cell differentiation.  In particular, JAK1/[ADDRESS_577312] to evaluate JAK inhibition in GVHD.  

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/[ADDRESS_577313] on T-cell differentiation, there is also evidence that JAK1/2 
inhibition impairs the differentiation, maturation, and cytokine production of dendritic cells,38 
thus impacting antigen presentation.  JAK1/[ADDRESS_577314] shown that STAT1 and STAT3, which serve as transcription 
factors after being phosphorylated by [CONTACT_452802], are activated in an early stage of 
aGVHD, and lead to further proinflammatory cytokine production.39  These data further support 
the potential role of JAK inhibition in the treatment of GVHD.  Ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1/[ADDRESS_577315] 
maintained alloreactivity and anti-tumor activity.  Carniti et al demonstrated that treatment with 
ruxolitinib led to dose-dependent reduction in IL-6 and IL-12 levels; moreover, CXCR3 
expression was decreased on donor T-cells, which led to differential migration of T-cells to 
target organs compared to control mice.  They also showed some evidence of hepatotoxicity 
from ruxolitinib but no impact on hematologic parameters.  Spoerl et al showed that ruxolitinib 
led to decreased expansion of alloreactive T-cells compared to controls.  In addition, T-cell 
phenotypes differed, where the ruxolitinib treated mice had higher frequencies of Tregs, and 
lower CD4+ IFN-γ+ cells and T-central memory cells, which are known to maintain GVHD42.  
There was also evidence of direct suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation.  Choi et al, showed 
that ruxolitinib reduced T-cell CXCR3 expression, and reduced GVHD and survival by 
[CONTACT_21413] T-cell trafficking26,41.  
Broad JAK inhibition was evaluated by [CONTACT_358697] 43using tofacitinib, a JAK1/2/3 inhibitor, in a 
semi-allogeneic murine model, which led to reduction of GVHD pathology and suppression of 
donor CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ  production.  It also reduced mucocutaneous GVHD 
in a skin-specific model.  However, the JAK3 pathway is involved in Treg proliferation and 
survival, as well as hematopoiesis, and response to infectious pathogens.  Tofacitinib has not 
been tested clinically in patients with GVHD, and in general, there is theoretical concern that 
broad JAK1/2/[ADDRESS_577316] patients who are at higher risk for 
cytopenias and infection.  Thus, agents with selective JAK1/2 inhibition are preferable in this 
setting.
Based on the promising preclinical results of ruxolitinib in GVHD, there has been some early 
clinical experience in patients with GVHD.  Spoerl et al reported on their experience treating 6 
patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD (n=4) and cGVHD (n=2).42  The 2 patients with cGVHD 
had skin involvement and multiple prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and had a response after 1 week of treatment.  
These findings were concomitant with decrease in serum IL-6 and IL-2R (soluble IL2 receptor).  
At a low dose of ruxolitinib, cytopenias were not observed.  In a study from [LOCATION_013], 
ruxolitinib was used and retrospectively analyzed in 54 patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD 
and 41 patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD (median 3 prior lines of therapy) across 13 
transplant centers.44  In patients with cGVHD, the overall response rate (defined as 50% decrease 
of immunosuppression for at least 4 weeks) was 85% with a median time to response of 3 weeks 

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/2022
11(range 1-25).  Toxicities included cytopenias (17%) and CMV reactivation (15%).  There was no 
increase in malignancy relapse.  In addition, responses were not restricted to specific organs.  
Ruxolitinib off label use for advanced chronic GVHD has also been reported in an abstract of a 
case series from Emory, with similar results as in the German study (Khoury et al, American 
Society of Hematology Annual Meeting 2015).  These reports support further study of JAK 
inhibition in patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD.
1.2.3 Baricitinib
Baricitinib (LY3009104, formerly INCB028050, Eli Lilly and Company) is a selective JAK1/2 
inhibitor that has been studied in patients with inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, psoriasis, and diabetic nephropathy.  It is an oral, potent, and reversible inhibitor of 
JAK1 (IC 50=5.9 nM) and JAK2 (IC 50=5.7 nM), with less potency for JAK3, tyrosine kinase 2 
(TYK2), or other kinases.[ADDRESS_577317] been completed, and several studies in 
patients with psoriasis and diabetic nephropathy are ongoing.  Common toxicities seen across 
studies include decreases in hemoglobin and neutrophils (mean values usually remaining within 
the normal range), increases in platelets (mean values usually remaining within the normal 
range), increases in creatinine (mean values usually remaining within the normal range) and 
increases in exposure in patients with renal impairment, increases in total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides, increases in hepatic 
enzymes, increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and increased incidence of infections 
(mostly respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]).  Decreases in neutrophils and hemoglobin and other lab abnormalities have 
been reversible upon discontinuation of the drug.  
The efficacy of baricitinib in the treatment of RA has been demonstrated.  A Phase 2a study in 
patients with RA refractory to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) showed 
improvements in signs and symptoms of RA after treatment with baricitinib for 12 weeks, with a 
flat dose-response curve at 4mg, 7mg, and 10mg daily doses.48  This study did show an increased 
incidence of mild to moderate herpes zoster infections.  A randomized controlled Phase 2b study 
using baricitinib for RA with inadequate response to methotrexate at doses of 1, 2, 4, and 8mg 
showed that patients treated at 4mg and 8mg had significantly better response compared to 
placebo at 12 weeks.49  There was no difference between the 4mg and 8mg groups in regards to 
efficacy.  However, there were more hematologic toxicities with the 8mg dose (decreases in 
neutrophil count and hemoglobin).  Other common adverse events included upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_54582], and increases in LDL, HDL, creatinine, and CPK.  Importantly, there were no 
cases of opportunistic infections.  Based on these results, the 4mg dose was the dose chosen to 
evaluate in the Phase 3 studies in RA.50  There is some experience at the NIH using baricitinib in 
patients with rare autoinflammatory conditions, and per personal communication (data 
unpublished), there have been cases of BK virus infection.  The final results of this study are 
pending, and infection will be monitored closely on the current protocol.  
In regards to pharmacodynamics, baricitinib maximally inhibits cytokine-induced STAT 
phosphorylation at 2 hours after the dose.  A dose of 10mg has shown 70% reduction in IL-6 
induced phosphorylation of STAT3, which returns to baseline at 24 to 48 hours without

12subsequent dosing45.  In the Phase 2a study in patients with DMARDs-refractory RA, significant 
reductions in plasma levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α were observed after 12 weeks of treatment at 
both 7mg and 10mg doses.  
Baricitinib has not been previously evaluated in the treatment of patients with GVHD.  Based on 
the efficacy of baricitinib in RA through the mechanism of selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibition, 
the growing data supporting the use of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of aGVHD and cGVHD, 
and the dire need for effective second line therapeutic options in cGVHD, we aim to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of baricitinib in patients with cGVHD that is refractory to steroids.

2.1.3 Recruitment Strategies
This protocol may be abstracted into a plain language announcement posted on NIH websites 
and on NIH social media platforms. In addition, patients will be directly referred to the NIH for 
this clinical trial through the well-developed NIH chronic GVHD study group referral base.  In 
addition, patients who are referred for the CCR protocol “Natural History Study of Clinical and 
Biological Factors Determining Outcomes in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease” study (04-C-
0281) will be screened for this trial.  Also, patients who undergo SCT at the NIH will be eligible 
for enrollment on this trial, which will provide another mechanism for screening patients.  
Finally, physicians and patients will be made aware of the study through our patient advocacy 
groups (National Marrow Donor Program, National Bone Marrow Transplant Link, Blood & 
Marrow Transplant Information Network, Meredith Cowden Foundation) and other professional 
forums.

2.4 BASELINE EVALUATION
The following studies will be performed at baseline after consent and enrollment on this protocol 
and within 10 days prior to starting the study drug, unless otherwise indicated below. Tests done 
at screening that fall within the appropriate timeframe for baseline testing need not be repeated.
History and physical exam, Karnofsky performance status
Documentation of cGVHD diagnosis per NIH criteria (ref), NIH organ and global stage 
(Appendix D  and Appendix E), baseline assessments (clinician assessment form A and 
patient assessment form B) (Appendix F and Appendix G) per NIH response criteria,51 
date of cGVHD diagnosis, prior and current treatments, prednisone or other steroid dose, 
and other patient, donor, and transplant characteristics (Appendix H)
Laboratory studies: CBC with differential, serum chemistries (including sodium, 
potassium, chloride, CO2, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
creatinine, glucose, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, AST 
(SGOT), ALT (SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid), CK, urinalysis, 
pregnancy test, TBNK, drug levels if pertinent (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus), 
CRP, C3 and C4, immunoglobulin levels, CMV PCR, BK virus PCR (blood and urine), 
fasting lipid panel
Pregnancy test in women that can have children
MRI of the involved extremity if clinically indicated (acceptable if done within 4 weeks)    
Specialty evaluations of cGVHD (acceptable within 4 weeks): dermatology, 
ophthalmology, dental, rehabilitation and occupational therapy, gynecology for females 
Occupational therapy evaluation: functional assessment (ACS and HAQ), fatigue 
assessment (MDFI), and upper extremity use (DASH/MAM) (See Appendix L)
Patient-reported outcome surveys: Lee cGVHD symptom scale, human activity profile, 
FACT-BMT (See Appendix I )
Optional diagnostic and research biopsies of the skin and mouth, and other organs (only 
if clinically indicated).  Biopsies performed within 3 months prior to enrollment (e.g. on 
04-C-0281 “Natural History of Chronic GVHD” protocol) are acceptable.  Patients may 
opt out of research and diagnostic biopsies and these will not be required for initiating 
study drug.

16Research samples (blood, saliva, oral microbiome swabs) (see Section 5.1) Saliva and 
oral microbiome swabs will be collected at the time of the oral biopsy, if performed
Documentation of concurrent medications
Of note:  Patients who have already been enrolled, but who have symptoms suggestive of 
infection (fever, productive cough, radiologic findings) at the baseline evaluation will have 
further workup as standard of care to rule out active infection. Patients with active infection will 
be treated until the infection is under control or antibiotic therapy is completed.  Baseline 
procedures that have exceeded the desired timeframe will be repeated before the patient may 
begin study therapy.
3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a phase 1/[ADDRESS_577325] demonstrated a good safety profile (Baricitinib 
Investigator’s Brochure, Eli Lilly and Company).  Based on studies in patients with RA, there 
seems to be a plateau efficacy response at doses above 4mg daily, and it is the 4mg daily dose 
that was taken to the Phase [ADDRESS_577326] 4 weeks will be able 
to restart at 1mg daily, and will continue at this dose as tolerated (see Section 3.1.1).  If they 
experience a DLT at this dose, they will be taken off treatment.  Regarding efficacy, patients 
who have a complete response (CR) on 2mg daily at [ADDRESS_577327] a partial 
response (PR) or unchanged disease at [ADDRESS_577328] a response, then no further patients will be treated in cohort 2. 

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/[ADDRESS_577329] 7 patients treated on cohort 2, then 21 
evaluable patients will be treated in cohort 2.
Concurrent topi[INVESTIGATOR_452774] (see Section 4). Other systemic immune suppression must stay stable or be 
tapered (systemic immunosuppression taper should be attempted no earlier than after 4 weeks on 
study), throughout the treatment with baricitinib (with up to 2 steroid pulses allowed for disease 
stabilization per Section 4.1). 
Patients who discontinue therapy for any reason will be followed for up to 24 months after 
discontinuing baricitinib as indicated in section 3.5.
Peripheral blood samples will be collected prior to treatment, at 2 weeks, at 12 weeks and every 
12 weeks thereafter to evaluate cytokine and cellular profiles, STAT phosphorylation, candidate 
chronic GVHD biomarkers.  Pharmacokinetic studies will also be performed at each dose level 
on day 1 and after 15 days of treatment (Section 5.1.3).

183.1.1 Dose Limiting Toxicity
DLT will be defined as any grade ≥3 non-hematologic or grade ≥4 hematologic adverse event, or 
hemoglobin <6.5 g/dL, within 4 weeks of starting any dose level (1mg, 2mg or 4mg) except 
those that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes.   One intrapatient dose de-
escalation after a DLT will be permitted in patients who have not experienced cGVHD 
progression.  In patients that have experienced disease progression, further dosing will cease in a 
patient at the occurrence of the first DLT.    

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/2022
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation
This study will include an intra-patient dose escalation.  The starting dose of baricitinib will be 
2mg PO daily, a dose that has been well tolerated in previous studies of patients with 
autoimmune diseases.  The first [ADDRESS_577330] a PR or unchanged disease (see Section 6.3), the dose will increase to 
4mg until the primary efficacy endpoint evaluation takes place at [ADDRESS_577331] a response, then 
patients will begin to be enrolled onto cohort 2, and will be started at the 4mg PO daily dose 
initially, unless they experience a DLT, at which time they will decrease the dose to 2mg.  
As an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91600], if 2/3 or greater patients at any given dose level experiences 
a dose limiting toxicity requiring dose reduction or discontinuation, that dose will not be 
subsequently used.  
3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
Baricitinib will be given as 1 mg, 2mg or 4mg tablets to be taken orally once a day on days 1-28 
of a 28 day cycle.  Each daily dose should be taken at approximately the same time of day.  
There is no restriction in regards to taking the drug in relation to meals.  Patients will be asked to 
complete a medication diary (see Appendix J).  
Baricitinib tablets should be swallowed whole and not broken or chewed.
If a dose of baricitinib is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day, unless it 
is within [ADDRESS_577332] study staff immediately.
3.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS
Patients who develop grade 2 toxicity (not including comorbidities that are present at baseline 
prior to treatment) for >7 days should hold baricitinib until the toxicity resolves (≤grade 1) and 
then restart at the same dose level.  Toxicities will be monitored at each study visit.  If grade 2 
toxicity recurs or worsens, the patient should be reduced to the next lower dose level, unless they 
are at dose level -1, at which time they should discontinue study drug.  Should the toxicity recur Intra-patient Dose Escalation Schedule
Dose Level Dose of IND Agent
Level -1 1mg
Level 1 2mg
Level 2 4mg

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/2022
20after dose reduction, the patient should be taken off treatment.  In the case of multiple 
simultaneous grade 2 toxicities, these instructions will apply to each individual toxicity 
separately.  
After the 4 week DLT assessment period for any dose level, patients who develop grade 3 non-
hematologic or grade 4 hematologic toxicity (not including comorbidities that are present at 
baseline prior to treatment), or hemoglobin <6.5 g/dL, should hold baricitinib until the toxicity 
resolves (≤grade  1 or baseline).  If the toxicity resolves within 28 days, patients may restart at the 
next lower dose level, unless they are at dose level -1, at which time they should discontinue the 
study drug.  Should the toxicity recur at grade 3 non-hematologic or grade 4 hematologic toxicity 
(not including comorbidities that are present at baseline prior to treatment), or hemoglobin <6.5 
g/dL, after dose reduction, the patient should be taken off treatment.
Patients who develop grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity should discontinue and be taken off 
treatment.
Study drug may be held up to 28 days for resolution of grade 2 or grade 3 toxicity.  Otherwise, if 
no resolution within 28 days, patients will be taken off treatment, 
For infection related toxicities only: study drug should be held for any infectious toxicity of 
≥grade 3.  Infection will need to be controlled with appropriate management prior to restarting 
study drug for grade 3.  If the infection occurs at the time of a study evaluation, all of the 
assessments at that time point will need to be postponed until the infection is controlled.  Study 
drug can be restarted at the same dose level for grade 3 unless other criteria are met for dose 
reduction as above.  Study drug may be held up to 28 days in the setting of uncontrolled 
infection; otherwise, if no resolution within [ADDRESS_577333] NIH chronic 
consensus recommended criteria for the evaluation of cGVHD in clinical trials.  Questionnaires 
will be completed by [CONTACT_452803] (see section 
3.7,  Study Calendar ).  These standardized assessments are designed to evaluate patient quality 
of life (FACT-BMT), functional performance (HAP) and symptoms (Lee cGVHD symptom 
scale). The purpose of these evaluations is to assess the potential benefit of the administered 
therapy as compared to the baseline. These forms have been extensively used, published and 
validated. These forms are also standard part of many NCI CCR cGVHD protocols (Appendix 
I). Patient questionnaires are only offered in English and are therefore not required in non-
English speaking subjects that may unexpectedly be enrolled on the protocol.

patient and/or the primary physician’s office at 12, 18 and 24 months after completing 
baricitinib.  If they choose not to follow up at 3 months, they will be followed up by [CONTACT_25600].  
The phone call will focus on a) survival status and cause of death if pertinent, b) ongoing 
systemic treatment for cGVHD and date of discontinuation, c) primary malignancy progression, 
d) any second primary malignancy, e) return to work part-time or full-time.  Primary and 
contributing causes of death are to be recorded in the CRF and the patient’s medical record.
3.[ADDRESS_577336] data, as well as the ability to share the patients’ health 
information with other health professionals. Providers may include primary providers, 
specialists/consultants and nurses. Other members of the healthcare team may also be present to 
aid with the communication devices, scheduling or records management. These visits may 
include the following: patient history, verbal exam, symptom reporting, education, and 
questionnaires.
The patient or patient’s legal representative will be informed prior to the use of a telemedicine 
encounter and consent will be obtained as outlined in the Consent Process and Documentation 
(section 12.6). 
Telemedicine visits will be arranged through our NIH Clinical Center Health Information 
Management Department and will be scheduled using NIH-approved remote platforms. 
Telemedicine visits may be used for follow-up visits if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_978]. All 
telemedicine visits must be documented in CRIS like a normal onsite visit and the note should 
indicate that this visit was performed virtually. Remote visits will be conducted in compliance 
with NIH guidelines and FDA regulations. 
Local Evaluations
A patient may be asked to come to the NIH CC for an in-person assessment or be referred to 
their local provider or outside lab, at the discretion of the investigator. All physical exams, 
assessments, and labs used for follow-up visits may also be performed with the patient’s local 
physician or completed at outside labs. For laboratory evaluations conducted with local 
providers, interlaboratory variability is not a concern. In the case of any visits with participants’ 
local providers or outside labs, records will be obtained.

baricitinib treatment (with intent to sample as close to the same area as possible).  
Immunohistochemistry methods will be applied to look for T-cell infiltrates, and IFN-induced 
factors in the oral mucosa and erythematous skin.  The advantage of histology is the greater 
amount of information on cell populations and functional changes in situ of the disease.  These 
biopsies will be obtained by [CONTACT_452809], stored and analyzed at 
the Blood Processing Core ([CONTACT_62583]’s Lab).  A biopsy sample will be also sent to the NCI 
pathology laboratory.  Patients will have an option to decline any of these research biopsies.  
Biopsy samples collected on the 04-C-0281 cGVHD natural history study can be also used for 
these studies if obtained in the timeframe as part of the screening evaluations for this study.        
Whole saliva and oral swabs of the buccal mucosa, tongue and gingiva will be collected at the 
same time that the buccal mucosal biopsies are performed to evaluate the salivary proteome, 
microbiome and cytokine profile at baseline and after 6 months of baricitinib treatment. The 
samples may be analyzed using a variety of methods including immunohistochemistry, 
microscopy, gene expression profiling, microbial sequencing, and protein-based assays in order 
to assess oral tissues for immune changes and for local specific markers of response or lack 
thereof to baricitinib therapy.

295.1.2 Immunologic Analyses Using Plasma and PBMCs
1. Blood: Blood will be collected, and PBMC and plasma will be cryopreserved for later 
batch analyses of markers relevant to cGVHD activity.  Cellular markers of active 
cGVHD have been proposed, although not verified at multiple institutions or validated in 
prospective trials27.  Heparinized plasma will be assayed for potential markers of cGVHD 
activity (including but not limited to BAFF, IFN-induced chemokines).  
Pharmacodynamic of baricitinib (inhibition of cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation) 
will be assayed prior to drug administration and [ADDRESS_577347] on cGVHD will be collected prior to dose 
and 2 hours after dose at the following timepoints: baseline, at the time of any increase in 
dose level. Each aliquot contains 10 x 106 cells—with no more than cells in a single vial. 
All samples collected will be cryopreserved and frozen for future analyses as detailed in 
Section 5.2.1.
2.Plasma will be assayed for BAFF, CXCL9/CXCL10, IL-6, TNFα, and other IFN-induced 
chemokines. Take one [ADDRESS_577348] cryovials. Barcode as buffy plasma and store at 
-80°C. All samples collected will be cryopreserved and frozen for future analyses as 
detailed in Section 5.2.1. 
1. Additionally, ELISA assays may include but not be limited to the following 
proposed biomarkers of cGVHD: CXCL9, MMP3, DKK3, ST2, CD163
2. Additional or alternative plasma factors will be considered based upon relevant 
cGVHD biomarkers identified by [CONTACT_452810].
3.Monocyte transcriptome: Monocytes will be sorted from PBMC for Nanostring 
evaluation of the monocyte transcriptome.  This would be done on cryopreserved cells at 
the end of the study.  Monocytes circulate throughout the body, are responsive to a 
variety of cytokines in tissues affected by [CONTACT_452811] a reporter 
for changes in cGVHD-affected tissues.
4.Lymphocyte populations. Assays characterizing lymphocyte populations will be 
performed to include, but not be limited to, assessments of %CXCR3+ T-cells, %T-reg 
cells and %CD21 B-cells.  Furthermore, multilineage lymphocyte immune reconstitution 
after transplant will be investigated to examine the impact of JAK1/2 inhibition on 
lymphopoiesis (CD3, CD4, CD8, B and NK populations).  At baseline prior to dose, 2 
weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, and 48 weeks and if PI [INVESTIGATOR_452782], one 3mL lavender (EDTA) tube will be drawn and 
lymphophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_452783]’s CLIA certified 
Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_452784].  Further research assessments of the 
percentages of regulatory T cells, of naïve, memory and effector T cells and of B cell 
transitional, naïve and memory populations will be done in the Blood Processing Core 
([CONTACT_62583]’s Lab). Active cGVHD has been associated with decreases in Treg populations, 

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/2022
30reduced thymopoiesis (fewer naïve T cells) and increases in CD21- transitional B cell 
populations. 
The assays indicated are designed to assess the alterations in skin, oral mucosa and in circulating 
lymphocytes and plasma that may result from baricitinib.  If there is an increase in Th1 cells or a 
shift in Treg populations, this may be reflected in circulating T cell populations, plasma 
cytokines and tissue infiltrates. 
5.1.[ADDRESS_577349] 7 days of continuous treatment (on day 
15 of that cycle).  This testing is performed to ensure that drug concentrations do not exceed 
baricitinib exposures previously studied.  Each time the baricitinib dose is increased or decreased 
an additional single sample will be collected after at least 7 days of continuous treatment on the 
new dose (on day 15 of that cycle). The sample will always be collected immediately before 
taking the next baricitinib dose.  In addition, on the first day of each dose level, blood will be 
taken pre-dose, then at 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_577350] samples as prescribed in the timeline.  Samples that are 
collected ± 15 minutes of collection time will not be considered a protocol deviation.
In the event of a serious adverse event (SAE) or at the end of the study, an additional sample 
may be collected within [ADDRESS_577351] dose and the time of sample collection will be recorded.
All samples for measurement of baricitinib will be collected, processed, stored, documented and 
the Blood Processing Core ([CONTACT_62583]’s Lab). Plasma samples will be batch tested for baricitinib 
concentration not more than two years after collection using a validated liquid chromatography 
with tandem mass spectrometry method, with a limit of quantification of 0.5 ng/mL, by [CONTACT_452812], directed by [CONTACT_452813].

5.2 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING AND DISPOSITION
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system. 
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed. 
Samples will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if 
required. 
5.2.1 Sample Procedures
Blood and tissue samples, collected for the purpose of research under IRB-approved protocols of 
the Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch and the Immune Deficiency Cellular 
Therapy Program will be stored and may be archived by [CONTACT_251705] (BPC) will 
be barcoded, with data entered and stored in the Labmatrix utilized by [CONTACT_74908]. This is a secure 
program, with access to Labmatrix limited to defined Figg lab personnel, who are issued 
individual user accounts. Installation of Labmatrix is limited to computers specified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. 
These computers all have a password restricted login screen. 
Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to patients without Labmatrix access. The data recorded for each sample includes the 
patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, 
as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the clinical center 
patient number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the 
processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).
Samples are stored in locked freezers at -85°C (sera and plasma) or under liquid nitrogen (cells), 
according to stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite in the BPC and offsite at 
NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are 
required to be accompanied by [CONTACT_79922]. Access to stored clinical samples is 
restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a researcher named on the protocol. All 
requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix. All researchers are required to sign a form 
stating that the samples are only to be used for research purposes associated with this trial (as per 
the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples must be returned to the BPC. It is the 
responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_251679] a manner consistent with IRB approval.
[IP_ADDRESS] Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction 
Once primary research objectives for the protocol are achieved, researchers can request access to 
remaining samples for human subjects research, providing they have both approval of the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_452785]-approved protocol and patient consent or an OHSRP determination that the 
activity is exempt from IRB review. Following completion of this study, samples will remain in 
storage as detailed above. Access to these samples will only be granted following IRB approval 
of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material. 
If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_452786]: Baricitinib in cGVHD

6.3 RESPONSE C RITERIA
6.3.1 Definitions
Evaluable for toxicity:  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with baricitinib.
Evaluable for efficacy: Patients who complete 6 months of therapy will be evaluable for the 
primary endpoint of efficacy assessment. Patients who progress earlier will be also included in 

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/[ADDRESS_577356] received at minimum of 75% of planned baricitinib 
doses to be evaluable for the primary efficacy 6 month endpoint.     
6.3.2 Efficacy Analysis
The primary evaluation point is overall response at 24 weeks using the NIH cGVHD response 
criteria measures51.  The overall response score will be assessed as CR, PR, or lack of response 
as per NIH guidelines.  The organ-specific and other subcomponents of the overall response 
score will be analyzed individually and absolute values recorded.
Up to 2 corticosteroid pulses will be allowed, one for initial flares and one for late flares as 
described in Section 4.1.  
Response will be assessed every 12 weeks from the start of baricitinib.  To ensure comparability, 
baseline and on-study methods for response assessment will be performed using identical 
grading, scale or techniques.  The Chronic GVHD Assessment (Clinician) Form will be 
completed at each 12 week evaluation visit (Appendix F). Included in that form are both organ-
specific primary measurements and clinician-assessed secondary measurements. The response of 
each affected organ will be evaluated and an overall response will be determined. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Response Criteria
Efficacy will be assessed using NIH consensus criteria measuring for therapeutic response in 
clinical trials for cGVHD.
CR is defined as resolution of all manifestations in each organ or site
PR is defined as improvement at least 1 organ or site without progression in any other 
organ or site.  The criteria for PR and progression are provided in Appendix K
Lack of Response: including unchanged, mixed response, and disease progression: 
Mixed response: CR or PR in at least 1 organ accompanied by [CONTACT_452814]
Disease progression: see Appendix K for organ criteria
Unchanged : Outcomes that do not meet the criteria for CR, PR, disease progression, or 
mixed response
As outlined in Section 3.7, type of involved organ, location and its measurements will be 
recorded at scheduled evaluations and reported on the appropriate CRF, equal to “Chronic 
GVHD Assessment (Clinician) Form,” (Appendix F).  All other measurements not being 
included in primary assessment but clinically related to cGVHD (e.g., change of pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]) 
will be reported in the source documents. 
Skin and skin appendages:  Skin assessment will be based on the NIH 0-3 Skin Score, which 
correlates with cGVHD severity, symptoms, and survival (Appendix D ).  Clinician-perceived 
severity of sclerosis will also be captured on a 0-10 scale.  Patient-reported symptoms will be 
captured on a 0-10 scale and on the Lee symptom scale.
Musculoskeletal connective tissue:  Assessment of joint range of motion will be performed by 
[CONTACT_452815] (P-ROM) scale and the NIH 0-3 Joint Score, which correlate 
with changes in joint involvement.  In a prior study, both scales performed well but the 
Joint/Fascia scale better reflected clinical perception of improvement, and the P-ROM better 
reflected the clinical perception of worsening33.  If these measurements are discrepant, priority 

Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/2022
35will be given to the NIH 0-3 scale when improvement is detected, and to P-ROM when 
worsening is detected.  If the resolution cannot be achieved then the priority will be given to the 
NIH 0-3 Joint/Fascia scale, as the P-ROM is of more recent origin and still deemed exploratory 
in the 2014 NIH cGVHD organ staging recommendations4.    
Eyes:  The NIH Eye Score uses a scale of 0-[ADDRESS_577357] improvement of worsening in 
ocular cGVHD.  Patient-reported symptoms will be captured on a 0-10 scale and on the Lee 
symptom scale.
Mouth:  Mouth assessments on the NIH-modified Oral Mucosa Rating Scale (OMRS) include: 
(1) mucosal erythema by 0-3 grading based on the color intensity, (2) lichen-type 
hyperkeratosis by 0-3 grading based on the percentage of oral surface area,(3) ulceration 
by 0-[ADDRESS_577358]:  Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms will be graded through interview by [CONTACT_452816] 0-3 severity scales, and weight will be measured at each visit.
Liver:  Involvement of liver is graded according to the levels of total serum bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). 
Lung:  Absolute percent predicted of the forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_104763] (FEV1), 
forced vital capacity (FVC), single breath diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), 
total lung capacity (TLC), and residual volume (RV) will be measured on pulmonary function 
testing (post-bronchodilator response values, as cGVHD of the lungs is not a bronchodilator-
responsive process).  The %FEV1 will be used for response assessment.  Symptoms will be 
graded through interview by [CONTACT_452817] 0-3.  Slope of 
%FEV1 will also be measured. 
Genitals:  Patient-reported symptoms will be captured on a 0-10 scale.Global chronic GVHD 
Rating:  The overall clinical impression of patient’s cGVHD will be recorded on a 4-point (0-3) 
scale on the Chronic GVHD Assessment (Clinician) Form.  
Chronic GVHD Improvement Scale:  The overall changes of patient’s cGVHD symptoms 
during previous 3 months will be recorded on a 7-point (-3 to +3) scale on the Chronic GVHD 
Assessment (Clinician) Form.
Chronic GVHD Symptom Severity Scale:   The overall severity of patient’s cGVHD symptoms 
will be recorded on an 11-point (0-10) numeric scale on the Chronic GVHD Assessment 
(Clinician) Form.
Lee symptom scale was developed as a 30-item symptom scale with 7 subscales to capture the 
cGVHD-specific symptom burden (Appendix I ). This symptom scale showed to correlate with 
persons’ self-assessed mild, moderate, and severe cGVHD manifestations in cross-sectional 
validation analysis.  Evidence supports the validity, reliability, and sensitivity to chronic GVHD 
severity.
NIH organ 0-3 scoring ( Appendix D ) will be collected at the evaluation endpoints.

investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_577368] annually in a summary format.
8.8 SPONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION REPORTING
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non-compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual 
of Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol-specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol deviation identified by [CONTACT_83943] (PDTS) online 
application. The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and 
maintained per CCR PDTS user requirements. 
In addition, any deviation to the protocol should be documented in the participant’s source 
records and reported to the reviewing IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required protocol 
deviation reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 
Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol 
deviations.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure:
that the rights of the participants are protected; 
that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Practice and 
standard operating procedures; and, 
the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.  
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_83944] (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) 
Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable 
regulatory requirements.
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_62554]. CMPs will be protocol-specific, risk-based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and 
frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, 
expected enrollment rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will 
conduct a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change

If patients are enrolled in both cohort 1 and cohort 2, then up to 28 evaluable patients may be 
required (either 21 in cohort 1 or 7 in cohort 1 and 21 in cohort 2). In order to allow for a small 
number of inevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 31. It is anticipated that 8-12 
patients may be enrolled onto this protocol per year; thus, 2 to 4 years may be required to accrue 
up to 31 patients.

research participation (section 12.5), all subjects will be offered the opportunity to fill in their 
wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance 
Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can 
make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or 
cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_148364] (ACAT) to assess ongoing capacity of the subjects and to 
identify an LAR, as needed.
Please see section 12.6.1 for consent procedure.
12.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
12.4.1 Related to baricitinib
Potential risks of baricitinib include the range of toxicities described in Section 14.1.2 and the 
consent form.  There may also be unexpected side effects.  All subjects will be carefully 
monitored for side effects. 
12.4.2 Related to Blood Collection
Minor complications including bleeding, pain, and hematoma formation at the site of blood 
draws, or infections may rarely occur.
12.4.3 Related to Tissue Biopsy
Skin and oral punch biopsy is a minor surgical procedure that may be associated with temporary 
bleeding, hematoma at the site, local infection and postoperative discomfort.  These risks are small 
(generally <5%) and transient.

12.4.5 Related to ECG and echocardiogram 
Other than possibly experiencing some minor skin irritation from the electrodes there are no 
anticipated risks related to complete the electrocardiogram and/or the echocardiogram.
12.4.[ADDRESS_577376] scan is done at screening; however, all screening is performed on a separate study. 
Therefore, radiation risks are assessed to the screening protocols.
12.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
The benefits of the study include the potential to improve knowledge of the biology of cGVHD 
and impact of JAK inhibition in the treatment of this disease.  In addition, if shown to be 
effective, the study drug may improve overall outcomes after SCT, a curative therapy for many 
hematologic malignancies, as well as have implications for prevention.  Individual patients may 
benefit from participation in this protocol if treatment stabilizes or improves their cGVHD.  
Patients may also benefit by [CONTACT_452819] a study aimed at improving 
treatment of cGVHD, which we ultimately hope will benefit future patients.  The risks of the 
study to participants are minimal compared to the potential benefits to them or to the overall 
knowledge and future study of JAK inhibition in cGVHD.
12.6 CONSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant or consent designee(s) as applicable for review prior to consenting. A designated 
study investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the 
associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time 
as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with 
friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study 
investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.
The initial consent process as well as re-consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms used in compliance with 
policy, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated study investigator and with 
the agreement of the participant/consent designee.  Whether in person or remote, the privacy of 
the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant/consent designee, when 
in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted 
remotely, the participant/consent designee will be informed of the private nature of the 
discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed.
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or as described below, with a manual

14 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
14.1 BARICITINIB (IND # 129360)
14.1.[ADDRESS_577379] received baricitinib since the start of 
clinical development program.  
A large, randomized trial of tofacitinib (a JAK 1/2/3 inhibitor) in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis detected higher risk of heart attack, stroke, cancer and blood clots and death when 
compared to standard therapy with anti-TNF drugs. Based on these studies in September 2021, 
FDA extended this warning to baricitinib (JAK 1/2 ) and another JAK inhibitor drug used in 
arthritis. This warning has not been extended to similar drugs used for cancer (or GVHD).
The following potential treatment related side effects have been identified:
Increased Adverse Events Due to Increased Exposures in Patients with Renal Impairment: 
Data from completed studies indicate that subjects with renal impairment have increased 
exposures to baricitinib. Increased exposure could place a person at increased risk for any other 
risk that is related to exposure. Therefore, adjustment in dose has been implemented in clinical 
studies to compensate for these observed differences. Investigators should follow dosing 
guidelines specified in the protocol, and monitor creatinine in study subjects and follow protocol 
drug interruption and discontinuation criteria.
Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/2022
48Blood Clots in the Blood Vessels
Increased incidence of pulmonary embolism, venous and arterial thrombosis with another JAK 
inhibitor vs. TNF blockers. Events of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism 
(PE) have been reported in patients receiving baricitinib. 
Data from the placebo-controlled time period from the integrated safety analysis of Phase 2/3 RA 
studies showed a numerical imbalance in the reports of DVT/PE, with more events reported in 
the baricitinib 4-mg group compared to the placebo group. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate 
(EAIR) of DVT/PE for baricitinib-treated RA patients over long-term exposures [0.45] was 
similar to the background rates published in the literature. There was no pattern of increased or 
decreased risk in any given 48-week time period including long-term exposures. Risk factors 
found more commonly in patients with these events included prior history of DVT/PE, obesity, 
and older age. In a retrospective observational study of baricitinib in RA patients, a higher 
incidence rate of venous thromboembolic events was observed compared to patients treated with 
TNF blockers.
Baricitinib should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for deep vein thrombosis or 
pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) and enrollment of patients with multiple risk factors should be 
carefully considered in clinical trials. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, interrupt baricitinib, 
evaluate promptly, and institute appropriate treatment. 
Myelosuppression: Baricitinib is anticipated to down-regulate the JAK pathway and result in 
changes to WBC counts. Although dose-related decreases in neutrophils and other phagocytic 
cell lines have been observed, neutropenia and lymphocytopenia have been observed 
infrequently. Investigators should monitor leukocyte parameters in study subjects and follow 
protocol drug interruption and discontinuation criteria.
Increased Infections (including opportunistic infections and herpes zoster): In addition to 
the observed decreases in phagocytic cells, JAK inhibition down-regulates cytokines related to 
the immune system. Although infections and infestations were the most frequently reported SOC 
of TEAEs, an excess occurrence of infections typi[INVESTIGATOR_452791]. The incidence rate of herpes zoster observed in 
baricitinib studies is within the range reported in observational studies and clinical trials of 
patients with RA, including the rate observed in placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Investigators should monitor 
subjects for clinical signs and symptoms of infectious events, including herpes zoster. If a subject 
is clinically diagnosed with herpes zoster, the investigator should interrupt investigational 
product, initiate standard of care (including antiviral therapy and relevant supportive care as 
appropriate), monitor for multi-dermatomal involvement or other evidence of dissemination, and 
follow subjects until clinical recovery of skin lesions (vesicles). For study subjects at risk for 
herpes zoster, investigators should encourage, and offer to provide, vaccination against 
varicella/zoster prior to starting investigational product in clinical trials (at least 4 weeks before 
randomization).
Increased Cardiovascular Events: Higher rate of MACE (defined as cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction, and stroke) with another JAK inhibitor vs. TNF blockers in RA patients. 
Higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death with another Janus 
kinase inhibitor (JAK) vs. TNF blockers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Increases in mean 
total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides have been noted in studies with baricitinib. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance data indicate that the changes in cholesterol are due primarily to 
Abbreviated Title: Baricitinib in cGVHD
Version Date: 10/19/2022
49increases in the number of HDL particles without a change in HDL particle size; an increase in 
the number of large LDL particles with no significant increases in small, medium-small or very 
small LDL particles; and an increase in the number of total, as well as medium and small, very 
low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. The mean values for the HDL/LDL ratio did not 
change. These changes in lipid particles, particularly in view of the observed increase in large 
LDL particles, suggest that the overall effect on the vasculature may not be atherogenic52-54. Data 
from A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Dose-Ranging, Parallel-Group, Phase 
2b Study of LY3009104 in Patients with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis on Background 
Methotrexate Therapy (Study JADA) [ADDRESS_577380] should be interrupted or 
discontinued if major adverse cardiovascular events occur.
Fetal Malformations: Reproductive toxicity was observed in rat and rabbit toxicology studies, 
including maternal toxicity and skeletal malformations in the rat fetus. A decrease in mating 
performance (fertility and copulation indices) was observed in the male rat fertility study. This 
change occurred without effects on spermatogenesis as assessed by [CONTACT_452820]/sperm endpoints. Pregnant women should not participate in clinical studies of baricitinib.
To manage any potential risks, women and men of reproductive potential should avoid becoming 
pregnant or fathering a child by [CONTACT_2329] [ADDRESS_577381] 7 days following exposure to baricitinib. If the 
patient becomes pregnant, study drug should be discontinued for the duration of the pregnancy 
and any subsequent period of breastfeeding.
Malignancies: Baricitinib has immunomodulatory effects on the immune system. Effects on the 
immune system may permit emergence of malignancies previously contained by [CONTACT_315624]. No signals concerning effects of baricitinib on malignancy have emerged from clinical 
studies. Long-term safety evaluations for baricitinib are ongoing. Patients should be monitored 
closely for evidence of neoplasia or malignancy, and study drug should be discontinued if such 
events occur.
Higher rate of lymphomas and lung cancers with another JAK inhibitor vs. TNF blockers in RA 
patients.
Pharmacologic Interaction between NSAIDs and Baricitinib to Decrease the Capacity of 
the Kidney to Respond to Hemodynamic Changes: Among patients in Study JADA46, with at 
least 1 creatinine value ≥ 1.3 mg/dL, two-thirds of them had other data to suggest that an 
intercurrent illness with transient hemodynamic effects had occurred preceding or coincident 
with the increased creatinine value and that concomitant use of a NSAID may be associated with 
an increased risk of increased creatinine and decreased GFR in this circumstance.

An open-label drug-drug interaction study (Study JADB)46 was conducted in patients with 
RA to evaluate the effects of coadministration of baricitinib (5 mg BID or 10-15 mg QD) and 
methotrexate (7.5-25 mg weekly) on the PK profiles of each drug, as well as methotrexate’s 
metabolite, 7-OH-methotrexate. Baricitinib coadministration did not significantly affect dose 
normalized C max or AUC of methotrexate or 7-OH-methotrexate. Methotrexate co-
administration had no significant effect on the geometric mean C max or AUC of baricitinib. 
Thus, dosing regimens of baricitinib and methotrexate need not be altered when these 2 drugs 
are co-administered.

In skin: higher of the 2 scores to be used for calculating global severity
In lung: FEV1 is used instead of clinical score for calculating global severity
If the entire abnormality in an organ is noted to be unequivocally explained by a non-cGVHD 
documented cause, that organ is not included for calculation of the global severity
If the abnormality in an organ is attributed to multifactorial causes (GVHD plus other causes) the

This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union .[ADDRESS_655513] the PAD information accepted into the label . This is 
achieved  by [CONTACT_508070] “Follow -up change in maximum walking distance on 
a constant load treadmill test” to confirmatory secondary endpoint with the purpose of ensuring that 
the follow -up period results are taken into consideration by [CONTACT_508071]. 
Additionally, this amendment includes the inversion of confirmatory endpoints “Change in pain -
free walking distance on a constant load treadmill test” and “Change in Vascular Quality of Life 
Questionnaire -6 (VascuQoL -6) score ”, as well as a small chan ge in the wording of the secondary 
objective related to VascuQoL -6 questionnaire, to clarify the measured concepts . This will 
strengthen our position to submit a label containing the VascuQoL -6 results.

assessing the proximal concept of 
symptoms and impacts of 
intermittent claudication, that can 
be more directly associated with 
PAD defining concepts. At the 
same time, “quality of life” is a 
distal concept that could be 
influenced by [CONTACT_508072] (whether environmental

2.1 Trial rationale  
Semaglutide  (trade  name [CONTACT_508121])  is a GLP -[ADDRESS_655533] (GLP -1-RA) indicated to improve 
glycae mic control in patient s with type 2 diabetes (T2D) as an adjunct to diet and exercise.6 In the 
large clinical development program me for subcutaneous (s.c.) semaglutide  for once weekly (OW) 
administration in T2D, semaglutide  was superior in terms of glycaemic control and weight loss vs. 
all comparators (placebo or other approved T2D treatments).6 In addition, the cardiovascular effects 
of semaglutide  were assessed in a phase 3a cardiovascular outcomes trial (NN9535 -3744, 
SUSTAIN 6). In this trial, treatment with semaglutide  demonstrated a statistically significant 26% 
reduction in major adver se cardiovascular events (MACE) comprising death from cardiovascular 
causes, non -fatal myocardial infarction, and non -fatal stroke when compared to placebo in patient s 
with T2D at high risk of cardiovascular events.[ADDRESS_655534]-hoc analy sis of data from the LEADER 
trial (EX2211 -3748), investigating the effect of liraglutide (first generation GLP -[ADDRESS_655535])  
in patient s with T2D and high risk of cardiovascular events, suggested a reduction in amputations in 
connection with foot ulc ers when treated with liraglutide compared to placebo.9  
Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is  an atherosclerotic manifestation  and is  a major 
cause of disability in older men and women affecting more than 200 mi llion people worldwide.3, 4 
T2D is together with smoking the two leading causes of PAD, and both critical limb ischemia and 
amputations are more common in PAD patients with T2D compared to PAD  patients without T2D. 
Approximately 1/[ADDRESS_655536] T2D.  Major risk factors are obesity, older age, 
smoking, and diabet es. PAD is diagnosed based on symptoms, ankle -brachial index (ABI) < 0.[ADDRESS_655537] increased risk of 
cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, faster rates of functional decline and mobility loss due to 
amputations, which represent a significant socioeconomic burden .10, 11 
The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate that semaglutide  1 mg once -weekly  improves clinical 
outcomes including walking distance compared to placebo  in patien ts with T2D and intermittent 
claudication due to PAD.   
2.2 Background  
To prevent the complications associated with T2D, the goal of the therapy is to mitigate the 
multiple heterogeneous metabolic defects associated with the disease and to reduce the occurrence  
of complications and comorbidities, e.g. atherosclerotic  disease.12

 Semaglutide  is a next -generation glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) receptor  analogue with a high 
degree of homology to human GLP -113 and is  approved in several countries under the trade name 
[CONTACT_508121]® by [CONTACT_3454].  
Lower extremity arterial disease is the third leading cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
morbidity, following coronary art ery disease and stroke.2 Manifestations of PAD include 
intermittent claudication  (30-40 % of PAD patients)  limiting functional capacity, fatigue, rest pain, 
impairment in quality -of-life, and ultimately, with progression of t he disease, necrosis and 
amputations3, 4, often below the knee.5, 6 PAD is prevalent in up to 30% of patient s with diabetes , 
and f or each 1% increase in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c), the inc idence of PAD increa ses 
28%.3, [ADDRESS_655538] (weight loss) and direct (vascular ) effects in PAD with 
intermittent claudication.  The potential weight loss  induced by [CONTACT_445027]  [ADDRESS_655539]  mechanisms of semaglutide  may include increased microvascular recruitment 
and improved blood flow by [CONTACT_508076], and decreasing vascular 
smooth cell proliferation, thereby [CONTACT_508077],  and limiting calf pain.12 
The trial will include patients with T2D and stable  PAD with intermittent claudication , Fontaine 
stage IIa . This population is appropriate for a functional outcome intervention and will ensure that 
the primary objective of the trial can be met within a reasonable timeframe and sample size and 
without a sub stantial number  of patients progressing to amputation or revascularisation during the 
course of the trial.  
2.3 Benefit -risk assessment  
Main benefits and risks are described in  below Section s. More detailed information about the 
known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events of semaglutide  may 
be found in the investigator’s brochure14 or summary of product characteristics/prescribing 
information6, 15 and any updates thereof.

Trial treatment ( semaglutide ) 
Gastrointestinal disorders  (GI) Consistent with other GLP -[ADDRESS_655540] frequent adverse events 
(AEs) with semaglutide  are 
gastrointestinal (GI) (nausea, 
vomiting and diarrhoea). In general, 
these reactions are mild or moderate 
in severity, of short duration, and 
dose dependent.   
In patient s treated with GLP -[ADDRESS_655541] an increased risk of 
hypoglycaemia.  The risk of hypoglycaemia can be 
lowered by [CONTACT_508078] . 
Diabetic retinopathy complications  In a 2 -year clinical trial with s.c. 
semaglutide  (NN9535 -3744 , 
SUSTAIN 6 ) involving 3,297 
patient s with T2D,  high 
cardiovascular ( CV) risk, long 
duration of diabetes and poorly 
controlled blood glucose, event 
adjudication committee  (EAC )-
confirmed events of diabetic 
retinopathy complications occurred 
in more patient s treated with s.c. 
semaglutide  (3.0%)  compared to 
placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk 
increase for diabetic retinopathy 
complications was larger among 
patient s with a history of  diabetic 
retinopathy at baseline. In the 
patient s who did not have a 
documented history of diabetic 
retinopathy the number of events 
were similar for s.c. semaglutide  and 
placebo. In the other clinical trials up 
to 1 year involving 4,807 patient s 
with T2D , AEs related to diabetic 
retinopathy were reported in similar 
proportions of patient s treated with Rapid improvement in glucose 
control has been associated with a 
temporary worsening of diabetic 
retinopathy,  but other mechanisms 
cannot be excluded. Long -term 
glycaemic control decreases the risk 
of diabetic retinopathy. These 
patient s should be monitored closely 
and treated according to clinical 
guidelines.

Allergic reactions  As with all protein -based 
pharm aceuticals, treatment with 
semaglutide  may evoke allergic 
reactions, including serious allergic 
reactions such as anaphylactic 
reactions  and angioedema .  As a precaution, patient s with known 
or suspected hypersensitivity to 
semaglutide  or related products will 
not be enrolled in this trial. In 
addition, patient s will be instructed 
to contact [CONTACT_508079][INVESTIGATOR_1884] a hypersensitivity 
reaction to the trial product occurs.  
Acute pancreatitis  Acute pancreatitis has been observed 
with the use of GLP -1 RAs. In the 
completed phase 3 trials with 
semaglutide  s.c. and oral 
semaglutide , both the event rate and 
the proportion of patient s 
experiencing confirmed pancreatitis 
were similar wit h semaglutide  and 
comparator. Few events were 
confirmed; the events occurred 
throughout the trial periods and the 
overall rates were similar to the rates 
reported in background populations.  Patient s should be informed of the 
characteristic symptoms of acut e 
pancreatitis and if pancreatitis is 
suspected, semaglutide  should be 
discontinued. If confirmed, 
semaglutide  should not be restarted.  
Pancreatic cancer  Patients with T2D have an increased 
risk of certain types of cancer such 
as pancreatic cancer. There is 
currently no support from non -
clinical studies, clinical trials or 
post-marketing data that GLP -1 
based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_197595]. However, 
pancreatic cancer has been classified 
as a potential class risk for all 
marketed GLP -1 RAs  by [CONTACT_174275]. There is no indication of 
an increased relative risk in the 
semaglutide  treatment groups vs. 
comparator, including placebo. The 
rates of EAC -confirmed events of 
pancreatic cancer were consistently 
low across trials.  Patient s with p resence or history of 
malignant neoplasm within 5 years 
prior to the day of screening will not 
be enrolled in this trial.  
Medullary thyroid cancer  Thyroid C -cell tumours were seen in 
mouse and rat carcinogenicity 
studies after daily exposure to 
semaglutid e for 2 years. The rodent 
C-cell tumours are caused by a non -
genotoxic, specific GLP -1 receptor 
mediated mechanism to which 
rodents are particularly sensitive. No 
C-cell tumours were observed in 
monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up To mitigate this risk, patient s with a 
family or personal history of 
medullary thyroid carcinoma or 
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 
(MEN2) are excluded from clinical 
trials with semaglutide .

infection in relation to site visits if 
an outbreak is ongoing in the given 
country . The risk of COVID -19 transmission 
in relation to site visits is overall 
considered to be low, however this 
may vary between geographical 
areas. 
To minimiz e the risk as much as 
possible, the following measure will 
be taken : 
 Cautious subject 
recruitment planning to 
ensure controlled subject 
enrollment in countries

reproductive toxicity. There are 
limited data from the use of 
semaglutide  in pregnant women.  Semaglutide  should not be used 
during pregnancy. Women of 
childbearing potential are required  to 
use highly effective contracepti ve 
methods  when participating in this 
trial Table  10-3.  If a patient  wishes 
to become pregnant, or pregnancy 
occurs, semaglutide  should be 
discontinued (please refer to protocol 
Section  8.3.5  for further guidance). 
The effect of semaglutide  on fertility 
in humans is unknown.  
 
2.3.2 Benefit assessment  
In clinical trials semaglutide  has provided superior long -term glycaemic control in T2D and 
clinically relevant reductions in body weight as compared to commonly used marketed products and 
placebo. A statistical ly and clinically  signifi cant reduction in cardio vascular ( CV) events has been 
demonstrated for semaglutide  s.c. (SUSTAIN 6).[ADDRESS_655543] an adequate glyc aemic control and CV risk factor

Rationale for trial population  
The trial will include patient s who are representative of the intended target population of patient s 
with T2D and PAD with intermittent claudication. Thus, it is intended to enrol a population of adult 
patient s with T2D and PAD in Fontaine stage IIa, corresponding to Rutherford classif ication grade 
1, categories [ADDRESS_655575] with a fixed speed 
(3.2 km/h; 2 mph) and fixed inclination (12%), has been set in this trial  to make the trial population

eligible for participation according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure transparen t reporting of screen failure patient s to meet 
requirements from regulatory authorities.  
Minimal information includes informed consent date , demography, screen failure details, and 
eligibility criteria.  
A screen failure session must be made in the interac tive web response system (IWRS).  
If patients withdraw their consent prior to randomisation or do not return for randomisation a screen 
failure session must be made in the interactive web response system (IWRS). The reason for failure 
will in all cases be c aptured in the electronic case report forms (eCRF).

 6 Treatments  
6.1 Preparation/handling/storage/accountability  
Only patients randomised to treatment may use trial product and only delegated site staff may 
supply trial product.  
Information on in -use conditions and in -use time will be available on the trial product label and in 
the trial materials manual (TMM).  
Each trial site will be supplied with sufficient trial products for the trial on an on -going basis 
controlled by [CONTACT_8784]. Trial product wil l be distributed to the trial sites according to screening 
and randomisation.  
The following requirements must be followed:  
 The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have 
been maintained during transit for all trial products received, and that any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the trial products.  
 All trial products must be stored in a secure, controlled, and monitored (manual or 
automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions  with access limited to the 
investigator and delegated site staff.  
 The investigator must inform Novo Nordisk immediately if any trial product has been stored 
outside specified conditions. The trial product must not be dispensed to any patient  before it 
has been evaluated and approved for further use by [CONTACT_3454]. Additional details 
regarding handling of temperature deviations can be found in the trial materials manual

Dose escalation intervals are applied to lower the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs). 
Dose escalation of semaglutide /placebo will take place during the first 8 weeks after randomisation 
(Section  4.2). Patient s should remain on the 1 mg dose level throughout the maintenance period; 
however, to prevent permanent premature treatment discontinuation and ensure as much exposure 
as possible, dose reductions, extensions of dose  escalation intervals and treatment pauses are 
allowed e.g., if treatment with the trial product is associated with unaccep table adverse events or 
due to other circumstances. Dose adjustments are at the discretion of the investigator  (please refer to 
Section  6.6). If a dose is missed, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible within [ADDRESS_655582] passed, the missed dose should be skipped,  and the 
next dose should be administered on the regularly scheduled day.

6.2.1 Medical devices  
Non-investigational medical device: PDS290 pen -injector  and activity tracker.  
Training in the PDS290 pen -injector  
The patient s must be trained according to the directions for use in handling the pen -injector when 
dispensed the first time and training must be repeated during the trial as needed. The investigator 
must document that directions for use are given verbally and in writ ing the first time trial product is 
dispensed and again during the trial as needed. Training is the responsibility of the investigator or 
delegate.  
Activity tracker  
Please refer to Section  8.1.3 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-investigational medical device s 
Non-investigational medical devices are listed in Section  6.1 as auxiliary supplies.  
6.3 Measures to minimise bias: Randomisation and blinding  
This trial is double -blind . All patient s will be centrally screened and randomised using an IWRS 
and assigned to the next available treatment according to randomisation schedule. Trial product will 
be dispensed/allocated at the trial visits summarised in the flowchart , Section  1.2. 
At screening, each patient  will be assigned a uniq ue 6-digit patient  number , which will remain the 
same  throughout the trial. Each site is assigned a 3 -digit number and all patient  numbers will start 
with the site number . 
The trial products containing active drug and placebo  are visually identical  and will be packed  in a 
manner that maintains blinding.  
The IWRS is used for blind -breaking. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole 
responsibility for determining if unblinding of a patient s’ treatment is warranted. Patient  safety must 
always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that 
unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_399863] N ordisk prior to 
unblinding a patient s’ treatment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the patient . If a 
patient ’s treatment is unblinded, Novo Nordisk (Global Safety department) must be notified within 
[ADDRESS_655584] print the "code break confirmation" 
notification generated by [CONTACT_8784], sign and date the document. If IWRS is not accessible at the 
time of blind break, the IWRS helpdesk should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Contact [CONTACT_508086]-CLIN-169560 1.0 VV-TMF-6027893 1 0.

premature EOT visit (V8A) as soon as possible after the decision to permanently  discontinue 
treatment is taken , followed by [CONTACT_508088] -up visit (V9A) 5 weeks after V8A . See the 
flowchart , Section  1.2 for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation ( V8A  and 
V9A) and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  Patients should continue with the 
originally schedule d site visits  (including V8 and V9)  after completing  the Premature EOT follow -
up visit (V9A). 
Once dosing has been initiated, the investigator should evaluate the safety profile at an individual  
patient  level on an ongoing basis, based on all available information. If a safety concern emerges,  
trial product discontinuation should be considered at the investigator ´s discretion.  
Efforts must be made to have patients who prematurely discontinue trial produc t treatment to  attend 
and complete all scheduled visit procedures  after completing the  premature  EOT  visits  (including 
visits 8 and 9 ), to collect the required data for the analysis of the primary (and confirmatory 
secondary) endpoint. Only patients  who withdraw consent will be considered as withdrawn from the 
trial. Patien ts must be educated about the continued scientific importance of their data, even if they 
discontinue trial product.  
If a patient  is unwilling to attend any of the scheduled clinic  visits, efforts should be made to have  
the remaining visits converted to phone contacts. However, as a minimum, these patient s must be  
asked to attend visit [ADDRESS_655594] of semaglutide  1 mg , testing for key endpoints will 
be performed at the follow -up visit (week 57), [ADDRESS_655595] should be resumed 
if the circumstances later allow ( Section  6.2). Similarly, patients who discontinue trial product on 
their own initiative should be encouraged to resume the treatment ( Section  6.2). At both instances 
dose escalation may be necessary ( Section  6.2). Date and last trial product dose s hould be recorded 
in the eCRF. A treatment status session in the IWRS should be performed when a patient is on 
treatment pause or resumes treatment.

 7.2 Patient  discontinuation/withdrawal from the trial  
A patient  may withdraw consent at any time at his/her own request . 
If a patient  withdraws consent, the investigator must ask the patient  if he/she is willing, as soon as 
possible, to have assessment performed according to visit 8A, followed by [CONTACT_508088] -up visit 
(V9A) 5 weeks after V8A . See the flowchart (Section  1.2) for data to be collected.  
Final drug accountability must be performed even  if the patient  is not able to come to the site. A 
treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS.  
If the patient  withdraws consent, Novo Nordisk may retain and continue to use any data collected 
before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a patient  withdraws fro m the trial, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not 
tested, and the investigator must document this in the medical record.  
Although a patient  is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing, the investigator must 
make a reason able effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the patient 's rights. Where 
the reasons are obtained, the primary reason for withdrawal must be specified in the end of trial 
form in the CRF.  
For patients who are withdrawn, when the trial com es to an end, the investigator must scrutinise 
publicly available registries to determine vital status, unless prohibited by [CONTACT_508089]. Please also refer to Section  4.[ADDRESS_655596] be taken if a patient  fails to return to the site for a required visit:  
 The site must a ttempt to contact [CONTACT_483154]/or should continue in the

 8 Trial assessments and procedures  
 The following Section s describe the assessments and procedures, while their timing is 
summarised in the flowchart , Section  1.2. 
 Informed consent must be obtained before any trial related activity, Section  10.1.3 . 
 All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential patient s 
meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
 The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patient s screened and 
to confirm eligibility or record reason for screen failure, as applicable.  
 Procedures conducted as part of the patient 's routine clinical management (e.g. eye 
examination), and obtained before signing of the informed consent, may be utilised for 
screening or baseline purposes, provided  the procedures meet the protocol -specified criteria . 
 At screening, patient s will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a 
trial and giving contact [CONTACT_508090] c ase of 
emergency.  
 Each patient  should be asked to provide contact [CONTACT_508091] (preferably at 
least 3), e.g. relative, primary care provider or other, whom the investigator can contact [CONTACT_508092]. The sites are encouraged to  
maintain as current details as possible throughout the course of the trial . For country -specific 
requirements see Appendix 8, Section 10.8. 
 The investigator should, if the patient  agrees, inform the patient ’s primary physician about  
the patient ’s participation in the trial.  
 Adherence to the trial design requirements, including th ose specified in the flowchart, is 
essential and required for trial conduct.   
 It is the responsibility of the investigator to schedule visits including laboratory assessments  
and contacts as per protocol, see flowchart, Section  1.2, and to ensure they take place.  For 
drug treatment compliance  see Section  6.4. 
 One phone contact [CONTACT_508093], see Section  1.2. During th is, the invest igator  
should remind the trial patient  to use the activity  tracker , if applicable.  
 Review of completed PRO questionnaires  and laboratory reports etc. must be documented 
either on the documents or in the patient 's source documents. If clarification of entries or 
discrepancies in the PRO questionnaires  are needed, the patient  must be questioned, and a 
conclusion made in the patient 's source documents. Care must be taken not to bias the 
patient . 
 Investigator must e nsure that d ata from the PRO  questionnaires  are transcri bed to the eCRF.  
 Future biomarker testing is planned and will not be included in the clinical trial report 
(CTR). Please refer to Section  8.8. 
 Repeat samples may be taken for technical issues and unscheduled samples or assessments 
may be taken for safety reasons. Please refer to Appendix  2, Section  10.2 for further details 
on laboratory samples.

inclination of 12% .21, [ADDRESS_655598] requires a treadmill capable of setting  the speed and inclination at the required values 
(speed 3.2 km/h, inclination of 12%). The technician instructing and supervising the treadmill test 
should preferably be unaware of HbA 1c, AEs, side effects, and laboratory parameters that could 
indicate the patient´s randomisation ( semaglutide  1 mg or placebo).  
The patient should be instructed  before performing  the treadmill test  to ensure  that he/ she 
understands that there will be two important time points during the same  test (see the following 
Section s). Patients should be encouraged to continue for as long as possible disregarding the pain. 
Treadmill testing is to be discontinued on the patient´s request or in the absence of claudication 
after a total walking duration of 20 minutes . Firstly, the patient should indicate when pain starts in 
either leg (pain -free walking distance)  but continue on the treadmill without stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Hereafter, the 
patient should continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_508046] (max walk ing 
distance).   
The baseline treadmill test is to be performed in the beginning of the baseline visit and in the end of 
the baseline visit to evaluate the variability within a single patient . As a minimum the two 
assessments should be one hour apart. This duplicate assessment is only needed at baseline.   
 
The treadmill assessments  at visits 6, 8  and 9  can be performed at a later day  than the other 
assessments and procedures at the given visit , provided that all assessments are  completed  within 
the visit win dow (visit windows are calculated from the randomisation date)  (Section 1.2).

flat treadmill mimicking a normal walking situati on. If the patient is able to walk at least 200 m 
(656 feet )on a flat treadmill with a fixed speed of 3.2 km/h (2 mph)  before onset of pain in either 
leg, the patient is potentially eligible. This test is only performed at screening and not at any other 
timepoint in the trial , please refer to flowchart,  Section  1.2. 
8.1.2 Patient Reported Ou tcome (PRO) questionnaires  
PRO questionnaires will be assessed at baseline (V2) , at 6 months visit (V6) and at end -of-treatment 
(Visit  8/8A). PRO questionnaires  are to be performed prior  to other visit -related activities.  Patient s 
should be given the opportunity to complete the questionnaires by [CONTACT_135543]. 
Each of the questionnaires takes approximately [ADDRESS_655599] been chosen for 
evaluation of the patient´s experience of symptoms and function : 
 Vascular Quality of Life 6 items  (VascuQoL -6) 
 Walking Impairment Questionnaire ( WIQ ) 
One generic PRO questionnaire has been selected to  evaluate the patient´s health -related quality of 
life:  
 Short Form 36 (SF -36) 
Furthermore, the Patient Global Impression of Change / -Severity  (PGI-C / PGI -S) will be correlated 
to the primary and secondary confirmatory endpoint s to assess a clinical meaningful change . 
The daily level of activity is furthermore investigated using activity tracker in  a sub -population.  
Questionnaires  
A more comprehensive overall PAD -related Quality of Life and functional measurement is 
performed using the VascuQoL -6 ques tionnaire ,23 which with 6 questions covers social, emotional, 
functional as well as pain- and symptom -related aspects of the patient´s overall quality of life. This 
questionnaire was developed from the original [ADDRESS_655600] validity and responsiveness and some evidence of content validity and internal 
consistenc y.24 
The patient -based ambulatory walking ability will be measured using the (WIQ)  for PAD patients16 
which assesses the ability to walk at various speeds  and distances and the ability to climb stairs. 
Evidence for internal consistency, test re -test reliability and responsiveness exist .25

will be measured in a 2 -week period both in the beginning of the trial, and in the end. This is a 
supplement to the treadmill testing and questionnaires, reflecting the potential influence on the real -
life activity level of the patients.  
Physical  activity data will be collected using a small wris t worn physical activity tracker designed 
for documenting physical activity. Data will be collected and transferred to Novo Nordisk from the 
physical activity tracker without site or patient interaction by a small data hub placed at the patient's 
home. Dat a can also be transferred manually at study site  as a back -up solution in case of hub 
transfer failure . The patient and the study site will be blinded to the physical activity data which are 
collected. During the course of  the study , the study site will ha ve access to data on patients wearing 
compliance and it is recommended that the study site encourages the patient e.g. , via phone and/or 
email to wear the physical activity tracker, if not done so.  
The site staff must instruct the patient according to foll owing recommendations:  
 The physical activity tracker should be worn on the non -dominant arm  
 The physical activity tracker should be firmly attached to the wrist and the tracker should 
not be able to slide up and down when the arm moves  
 The patient should wear the physical activity tracker as much as possible, preferably 
24 hours per day  during  the two 2-week periods.  
 The measurements from the physical activity tracker are summarised into daily measures 
representing different aspects of physical activity. The study site will have access to data on 
the patient’s wearing compliance.  
The physical activity tracker should be returned to the site when the site has un -assigned the 
physical activity tracker, either at the next clinic  visit or as agreed with the site.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Toe-brachial index (TBI)  and Ankle -brachial index (ABI)  
Measurements of the ankle -brachial index (ABI) and toe -brachial index (TBI) are the most common 
methods for assessing PAD. The measurements should be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_508048] [ADDRESS_655607] be performed at each  location (i.e. both right and left 
ankle , arm and  toe). 
The ABI is calculated  as a ratio of the higher ankle systolic pressure to the higher systolic pressure 
measured in both arms. The ankle pressure is preferably measured using a Doppler probe to obtain 
systolic pressures in the following locations: po sterior tibial and anterior tibial artery systolic 
pressures. The higher of the tibial pressure is chosen for the numerator for each leg, and the higher 
of the left and right brachial systolic pressure is chosen for the denominator.[ADDRESS_655608] 40% of the limb circumference. If a Doppler device  is used, 
an 8-10 MHz Doppler probe should be used  (standard vascular probe) .  
The TBI is calculated as a ratio of the toe systolic pressure to the higher systolic pressure measured 
in both arms.27, 28 If toe pressure is measured by [CONTACT_463385] (LDF) this should be with 
linear deflation pressure  and a cuff that is at least 1.2 times wider than the toe (usually a 2.5 – 
3.0 cm cuff for the great toe) . Equipment  for measurement of toe p ressure should be  standard 
equipment in all vascular surgical departments for TBI measurement. The Doppler probe is applied 
to the plantar surface of the distal portion of cleaned great toe (or in absence of it on the second 
toe), and the occlusive cuff is  placed around the proximal portion of the toe.  
The ABI and TBI should be measured and noted for both legs and toes  throughout the trial.

For more information on overdose, also consult the current version of the semaglutide  investigator's 
brochure .14  
8.5 Pharmacokinetics  
 Single blood samples for measuring plasma concentration of semaglutide will be drawn on  
visits specified in the flowchart.  
 The dosing information should be transcribed into the CRF for the date of the  last dose of 
trial product prior to the PK assessment , as outlined in the flowchart.  
 The exact timing of obtaining the PK sample must be recorded on the  laboratory form.  
 The purpose of measuring plasma semaglutide levels is to conduct exposure -response, and 
to evaluate adherence to the treatment.  
 Blood samples for PK assessments must be collected, handled and shipped according to the  
description in the laboratory man ual supplied by [CONTACT_2237]. The bioanalysis of  
semaglutide PK will be performed by a special laboratory. Semaglutide PK samples will be  
stored at the special laboratory responsible for PK until final CTR in case Novo Nordisk 
requests further an alysis of the PK samples. Details of the bioanalysis will be outlined in a 
bioanalytical study plan issued by [CONTACT_93419].

Collection of samples for biomarker research is part of this trial. Participation in the biobank 
component is optional. Patients who do not wish to participate in the biobank component may still 
participate in the trial. For the biobank, samples will be co llected according to the flow chart , 
Section  1.2 and stored for future use.  
Optional samples  for biomarker research that should be collected from patients  in the trial where 
possible are the following:  
 serum  
 plasma  
The samples are collected for the purpose of allowing future analyses of circulating biomarkers, at a 
later point in time when new knowledge or improved measurement techniques may have become 
available. The analyses may include biomarkers currently known or discovered in the future.  
In addition, samples will be stored, and analysis may be  performed on biomarker variants thought to 
play a role in PAD including, but not limited to serum and plasma analytes, or tissue biomarkers, to 
evaluate their association with observed clinical responses to semaglutide  1 mg . 
These samples need to be froze n and should be sent to the central laboratory. The analyses are 
likely to be performed after the trial has come to an end, and results will therefore not be part of the 
clinical trial report. The biobank samples may be stored up to 15  years after end of t rial at a central 
laboratory  (see Appendix 6, Section  10.6).

 9 Statistical considerations   
9.1 Statistical hypotheses  
For the primary endpoint , ratio to baseline in maximum walking distance at week 52 , the following 
confirmatory one -sided hypothesis is planned to be tested. Let the me dian ratio to baseline for 
semaglutide  1 mg  and placebo  be defined as Msema and Mplacebo, respectively . Superiority for the 
maximum walking distance at week 52 will then be tested as : 
H0: Msema ≤ Mplacebo against H a: Msema > Mplac 
Operationally the hypotheses will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1192] -sided tests.  
The hypothesis for the confirmatory endpoint , ratio to baseline in maximum walking distance at 
week 5 7 and pain-free walking distance at week 52 is the same as for the primary endpoint . 
Likewise , the hypothesis for the confirmatory endpoint , change from baseline in Vascu -Qol-6 score 
at week 52, is the same as for the primary endpoint, except that M denote s median change from 
baseline .  
Multiplicity adjustment  
The following hierarchical testing strategy will be applied to control the type -I error at an overall 
alpha level (two -sided) of 0.05 across the confirmatory endpoints:  
1. Superiority of semaglutide  1 mg vs. placebo on ratio to baseline (week 0) at week 52 in 
maximum walking distance  
2. Superiority of semaglutide 1 mg vs. placebo on ratio to baseline (week 0) at week 5 7 in 
maximum walking distance  
3. Superiority of semaglutide 1 mg vs. placebo on change fr om baseline (week 0) to week 52 in 
VascuQoL -6 score.  
4. Superiority of semaglutide  1 mg vs. placebo on ratio to baseline  (week 0) at week 52 in pain -
free walking distance . 
9.2 Sample size determination   
The primary endpoint is ratio to baseline (week 0) at week [ADDRESS_655618]. The confirmatory secondary endpoints are ratio to baseline (week 0) at 
week 57 in maximum walking distance , change from baseline (week 0) to week  52 in VascuQoL -6

      Status:  Final  
      Page:  [ADDRESS_655621], a complete dataset has been 
simulat ed using a normal distribution for the log -transformed primary endpoint.  
Treatment ratio ( semaglutide  1 mg versus placebo) is assumed to be 1.2, the coefficient of variation 
to be 0.8 and a 1:1 randomisation. There is some uncertainty over the coefficient  of variation but 
based on results from the cilostazol trials (by [CONTACT_508100])29-31 an 
assumption of a coefficient of variation  of 0.8 seems plausible.  
Missing observations due to death (2% in total corresponding to 8 deaths in each treatment group), 
inability to perform the treadmill test (3% in total corresponding to 12 cases in each treatment 
group), and due to other reasons (3% in total corresponding to 12 ca ses in each treatment group), 
have been introduced in the complete dataset assuming equal distribution between treatment group s.  
First, log -transformed endpoints that are missing due to other reasons than death or inability to 
perform the walking test are  imputed by [CONTACT_461835] a normal distribution corresponding to the 
theoretical distribution in the placebo group . Second, the  resulting imputed dataset is analysed using 
Wilcoxon rank -sum-test, where ranks are assigned as follows: Patient s with non -missi ng 
observations are assigned ranks according to the observed endpoint. Patient s with missing 
observation due to death  or physical  inability to perform the treadmill test are assigned ranks as 
described in Section  9.4.2. Third, the imputed standardized Wilcoxon test statistics are combined 
using Rubin’s rule to obtain a p -value.  
Repeating the simulation [ADDRESS_655622] be randomised 
to obtain 89% power for confirming superiority for the primary endpoint.  
Secondary confirmatory endpoints  
The same assumptions as for the primary endpoint apply for the ratio to baseline (week 0) at week 
57 in maximum walking di stance and ratio to baseline (week 0) at week 52 in pain -free walking 
distance.  This is also assumed achievable due to the mode  of actions of semaglutide . Therefore, 
with 800 randomised patient s there is a marginal power of 89% for confirming superiority f or this 
secondary confirmatory endpoint.  
For change from baseline (week 0) to week [ADDRESS_655623] deviation of 5 are assumed 
based on earlier trials.32 
Missing observations (8%) in total have been introduced in the simulated complete dataset in the 
same way as for the primary endpoint. The resulting imputed dataset is analysed using a Wilcoxon 
rank-sum-test with ranks assigned using the same algorithm for  the primary endpoint  and combined 
using Rubin’s rule to obtain a p -value . Repeating the simulation 5,000 times, each with 
50 imputations,  with 800 randomised patient s, the power is >99%  for confirming superiority of 
VascuQoL -6 score.

 Overall power  
The jo int (effective) power is calculated under the assumption of independence of endpoints by 
[CONTACT_508101]. Since some of these endpoints/tests are 
positively correlated, the assumption of independence is viewed as con servative.  
With the above assumptions, 89% power for confirming superiority for the primary endpoint will 
require a total of 800 randomised patient s (400 patient s randomised in each treatment group), when 
comparing semaglutide  1 mg to placebo. Table  9-1 summarises the assumptions for the sample size 
calculation and provides an overview of the marginal and joint power for each hypothesis.

 see Table  9-3 and for definitions  of analysis populations and observation periods, respectively . The 
following populations are defined:  
Table  9-3 Analysis pop ulatio ns 
Population  Description  
Randomised  All patient s randomised  
Full analysis set (FAS)  All patient s randomised. Patient s will be analysed according to the randomised 
treatment  
Safety  analysis set  (SAS)  All patient s randomly assigned to trial treatment and who take at least [ADDRESS_655626] of the following dates, both inclusive:  
 Date of the end -of-trial visit (V 9) 
 Date of death  
 Date when patient  withdrew informed consent  
 Date of last contact [CONTACT_508102] s lost to follow -up 
On-treatment   This observation period include s assessments and events for the time period 
where patient s are exposed to the investigational medicinal products, regardless 
of whether the patients have received  rescue treatment  or not, as well as baseline 
assessments.  The observation period starts at the date of first dose of trial 
product and ends at the follow -up visit for endpoints related to adverse events, 
and at last treatment day + 7 days  for other endpoints.  
More d etails regarding the on-treatment end date can be found  in the S tatistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
On-tream ent without rescue 
treatment  This observation period includ es assessments and events for the time period 
where patient s were  exposed to trial product and before rescue treatme nt. Thus, 
this observation period is  a subset of the on -treatment period,  excluding 
observations at and following r escue  treatment  
 
In general  patient s should not be excluded from an analysis set and observations should not be 
excluded from  an observation period, if they fulfil the criteria. If patient s or observations are 
excluded, the reasons for their exclusion mus t be documented before database lock and described in 
the clinical trial report. Any decision to exclude either a patient  or single observation from the 
statistical analysis is the joint responsibility of the members of the Novo Nordisk study group.  
9.4 Statistical analyses  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalised prior to first patient  first visit (F PFV), and it 
will include a more technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this 
Section . This Section  is a sum mary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important 
endpoints including primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints.

      Page:  [ADDRESS_655627] with associated  
two-sided 95% confidence intervals and p -values corresponding to two -sided tests of no difference . 
Unless otherwise mentioned, baseline assessment is d efined as the latest available measurement  
from the randomisation visit (V2) or the screening visit (V1). Thus, if a V2 assessment is missing  
then the assessment from V1 will be used as the baseline assessment, if available. For the endpoint 
‘maximum walking distance ’, the baseline assessment is defined as the mean of the two 
assessments from the randomisation visit  (V2). If only one of the assessments is available, this will 
be used as the  baseline assessment , and if no assessments are available at V2 then the assessment at 
V1 will be used . 
Data from all countries and sites will be analysed and reported together.  
9.4.2 Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint is ratio to  baseline (week 0) at week 52 in maximum walking distance on a 
constant -load treadmill . 
Acco rding to the primary estimand  (see Section  3.1.1 ), the primary analysis will be based on all 
randomised patient s and the in -trial observation period  and, as per the composite strategy for 
handling intercurrent events, patient s with missing v alues at [ADDRESS_655628], will be handled by [CONTACT_508081].  
Specifically, ranks for the primary endpoint will be assigned as follows:  
1. Patients with missing values due to  death are ordered by [CONTACT_508103] (the earlier death, the 
worse rank)  
2. Patients with missing values due to being physically unable to perform the test are ranked more 
favourably than all deaths, and ordered by [CONTACT_508104] (a higher ba seline 
value corresponds to a greater deterioration and so is assigned a worse rank)  
3. Patients with observed values or missing values due to other reasons than death or inability to 
perform the walking test, are ranked more favourably than all deaths or pat ients unable to 
perform the walking test, and ordered according to their actual or imputed value, see below (the 
lower the walking distance relative to baseline, the worse rank)  
The maximum walking distance will be log -transformed and the analysis will be based on 
difference between the log transformed value at week [ADDRESS_655629] their values imputed using multiple impu tation under a missing 
at random (MAR) assumption.  
Imputation will be performed separately within groups defined by [CONTACT_508105] 52, for a total of four groups:  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1  semaglutide/on -treatment;  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.2  semaglutide/off -treatment;

First, intermittent missing values are imputed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain a 
monotone missing data pattern, generating [ADDRESS_655630].  Rubin’s rule will be used 
to combine the standardised Wilcoxon test statistics. The confirmatory statistical testing will be 
based on the p -value from the pooled s tandardised Wilcoxon test statistic .  
Superiority is considered confirmed if the p -value is strictly below 0.05.  
For estimation of effect  in relation to the primary estimand , the Hodge s-Lehmann estimat or will be 
calculated on log -transformed data  for each of the 500 complete data sets . Rubin’s rule will be used 
to obtain inferences. Results will be back transformed to original scale , thus showing the median 
treatment ratio of the ratio to baseline in maximum walking distance and 95% confidence int ervals .

The secondary estimand for the primary endpoint (see Section  3.1.1 ), will be based on  all 
randomised patient s and the on-treatment  without rescue treatment observation period . The 
maximum walking distance  will be log -trans formed and the change  from baseline to the 52 weeks 
will be analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) . The model will 
include measurements at both week 26 and 52 as dependent variables. The independent effects 
included in the model will be treatment and reg ion as categorical fixed effects and baseline 
maximum walking distance (log -transformed) as a covariate, all nested within visit (week) as a 
factor. An unstructured covariance matrix for measurements within the same patient will be 
employed.  From the MMRM model the treatment difference at week 52 will be estimated and the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval and p -value will be calculated. The estimated treatment 
difference and confidence intervals will be back transformed to original scale, and thus prese nt the 
estimated treatment ratio with confidence interval.  
Sensitivity analyses  
As a sensitivity analysis for the primary estimand, a two -dimensional tippi[INVESTIGATOR_508055]. Missing data will be imputed according to the primary multiple i mputation approach 
and fixed values 1 and 2 will be added to each imputed value in the semaglutide treatment group  
and placebo treatment group , respectively. The primary analysis will then be performed  with these 
delta -adjusted imputations. This will be repeated for a grid of ( 1, 2)-values, including scenarios 
where patient s with missing values in the semaglutide group  have worse outcomes than those in the 
placebo group . This sensitivity analysis eval uates the robustness of the superiority conclusion to 
deviations from the MAR assumption for missing data.  
9.4.3 Secondary endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Confirmatory secondary endpoints  
The confirmatory sec ondary endpoints are:  
 Ratio to baseline (week 0) at week 5 7 in maximum  walki ng distance , and  will be analysed 
similarly to the primary endpoint  with regards to the estimands  
 Change from baseline (week 0) to week 52 in VascuQoL -6 score and  will be analysed 
similarly to the primary endpoint with regards to estimands but  will not be log-transformed.  
 Ratio to baseline (week 0) at week 52 in pain -free walking distance, and will be analysed 
similarly to the primary endpoint with regards to the estimands  
The confirmatory tests will be based on the primary estimand (the composite strategy and tre atment 
policy estimand).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Supportive secondary endpoints  
The ratio to baseline  in pain free walking distance at follow -up will be analysed similarly to the 
primary endpoint.  
All other supportive secondary endpoints will be analysed using a model similar to the MMRM 
model described as the secondary estimand for the primary endpoint.

correction. If corrections are made by [CONTACT_093]’s delegated staff  after the date when the 
investigator signed the CRF, the CRF must be signed and dated again by [CONTACT_093].  
The investigator must ensure that data is recorded in the CRF as soon as possible, preferably within 
5 working days after the visit. Once data  has been entered, it will be available to Novo Nordisk for 
data verification and validation purposes.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Monitoring  
The investigator must permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
agency inspections and provide direct access t o source data documents (original documents, data 
and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify,  and reproduce any 
record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical 
record doe s not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and 
dated printouts. In addition, the relevant site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring 
visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. , by [CONTACT_756]).   
Trial monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the 
CRF by [CONTACT_18029], complete and verifiable from source documents; that 
the safety and rights of patient s are being protected, to monitor drug accountability and collect 
completed paper CRF pages, if applicable, and that the trial is being conducted in accordance with 
the currently approved protocol and any other trial agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.

 Monitoring will be conducted using a risk -based approach including risk assessment, monitoring 
plans, centralised monitoring (remote assessment of data by [CONTACT_3454]) and visits to sites.   
Monitors will review the patient ’s medical records and other sour ce data, e.g. the PROs, to ensure 
consistency and/or identify omissions compared to the CRF.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Protocol compliance  
Deviations from the protocol should be avoided. If deviations do occur, the investigator must 
inform the monitor without delay and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and 
discussed.  
Deviations must be documented and explained in a protocol deviation by [CONTACT_18030], date, 
and the action(s) taken. Some deviations, for which corrections are not possible, can be 
acknowle dged and confirmed via edit checks in the CRF or via listings from the trial database.   
10.1.9  Source documents  
 All data entered in the eCRF must be verifiable in source documentation other than the CRF  
 The original of the completed PROs must not be removed from the site, unless they form 
part of the CRF,  and a copy is kept at the site.  
 For Activity tracker , data in the service providers’ database is considered source data.  
 Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the patient  and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the site.  
 Data reported on the paper CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source 
documents  must be consistent with the source documents, or the discrepancies must be 
explained. The  investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer 
records. Also, current medical records must be available.  
 It must be possible to verify patient ’s medical history in source documents, such as patient ’s 
medical record .  
 The investigator must document any attempt to obtain external medical information by 
[CONTACT_18031](s) when information was requested, and who was contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 Definition of what constitutes source data can  be found in a source document agreement at 
each site. There will only be one source document defined at any time for any data element.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Communication of results  
Novo Nordisk commits to communicate and disclose results of trials regardless of outcome. 
Disclosure includes publication of a manuscript in a peer -reviewed scientific journal, abstract  
submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting or disclosure by [CONTACT_11174].   
The results of this trial will be patient  to public disclosure on external web sites according to 
international and national regulations. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data 
until specified milestones are reached, for example when the CTR is available. This includes the 
right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may 
influence the results of the entire trial.  
At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by [CONTACT_1275](s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or 
communication for up to [ADDRESS_655645] intellectual property.

Novo Nordisk w ill work with one or more investigator(s) and other experts who have contributed to 
the trial concept or design, acquisition, analysis or interpretation of data to report the results in one 
or more publications.  
Authorship of publications should be in acco rdance with the Recommendations for the Conduct, 
Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals by [CONTACT_18037].39 
All authors will be provided with the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to

For a multi centre clinical trial, analyses based on single -site data usually have significant statistical 
limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or 
patient s, and therefore may not be supported by [CONTACT_3454]. Th us, Novo Nordisk may deny a 
request or ask for deferment of the publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript 
is accepted for publication. In line with Good Publication Practice, such individual reports should 
not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial.

 10.2 Appendix 2: Clinical laboratory tests  
The tests detailed in Table  10-1 and Table  10-2 will be performed by [CONTACT_2237] . 
Information on central laboratory can be found in Attachment I . 
Additional tests may be performed at any time during the trial as determined necess ary by [CONTACT_41161]. Only laboratory samples specified in the protocol 
should be sent to the central laboratory for analysis; if additional laboratory sampling is needed, e.g. 
to follow up on AEs, this must be done at a  local laboratory.  
The central lab will communicate to the investigator abnormal values of parameters not requested in 
the protocol but identified by [CONTACT_111428]/or their processes according to their lab 
SOPs. These data will not be transf erred to the trial database. The investigator should review such 
values for AEs and report these according to this protocol.  
The investigator must review all laboratory results for concomitant illnesses and AEs.  
Laboratory samples will be destroyed no later than at finalisation of the CTR , except  for biomarker 
samples, which will be stored as described in Appendix 6, Section  10.6. 
For female patient s of childbearing potential, l ocal urine pregnancy tests must be performed at

10.3.[ADDRESS_655646] (IMP), whether or not considered related to 
the IMP.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign, including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, symptom or diseas e (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of an IMP.  
 
Events meet ing the AE definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results or safety assessments considered clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator, including events that 
have worsened from prior to the time point from which AEs are collected  
 Conditions detected or diagnosed after IMP administration even though it may have been 
present prior to the time point from which AEs are collected  
 Exacerbation/worsening of a chronic or intermittent condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
 Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction  
 Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequela e of a suspected overdose of IMP regardless of 
intent  
A "lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be reported as 
an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, 
symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE 
if they fulfil the definition.  
Events NOT  meeting the AE definition  
 Conditions present prior to the time point from which AEs are collected and anticipated 
day-to-day fluctuations of these conditions, including those identified during screening or 
other trial procedures performed before exposure to IMP.  
 Note: Conditions present or occurring prior to the time point from which AEs are 
collected should be record ed as concomitant illness/medical history.  
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectomy). The condition that leads 
to the procedure is the AE.  
 Medical or surgical procedures not preceded by [CONTACT_18040] a known 
condition.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_655647] one of the following criteria:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the patient  was 
at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death, if it were more severe.

  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508058] s that the patient  has been detained at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91261]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508059]. If a comp lication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17955], 
the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17956] (e.g. elective medical or surgical procedures) of a 
condition that was present prior to the time point from which AEs are collected, and that 
did not worsen, is not considered an AE.  
 Note:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17957], trial related, social and convenience reasons do 
not constitute AEs and should therefore not be reported as AEs or SAEs.   
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111371], planned before trial inclusion, 
are not considered AEs or SAEs .  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal 
life functions.  
 This definition is not intended to include experience of relatively minor medical 
significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle), which ma y interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenita l anomaly/birth defect  
f. Important medical event:  
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations. This includes important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening  or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508060]. These events should usually be considered serious 
and reported as SAE s using the important medical event criterion.  
 The following adverse event s must always be reported as SAE s using the important 
medical event criterion if no other seriousness criteria are applicable:  
 Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_17960] 
 Risk of liver injury defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) >3 x UNL and total bilirubin >2 x UNL where no 
alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law)

 Stroke or transient ischemic attack : 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_508062], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], 
or retinal vascular injury as a result of  haemorrhage or isch aemia, with or without infarction  
 Acute or chronic limb ischemia requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] : 
Acute limb ischemia is defined as a sudden decrease in limb  perfusion threatening viability of 
the limb and leading to an urgent,  unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] .  
Chronic limb ischemia is defined as a chronic condition with rest  pain, non -healing ulcers or 
gangrene and leading to an urgent,  unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508063] a  revascularization procedure, amputation or pharmacological ther apy. 
Adverse events requiring additional data collection  
 Events leading to coronary artery re vascularisation  (ACS  and non -ACS) : 
 ACS and non -ACS (e.g. stable angina pectoris) leading to catheter -based 
(percutaneous  coronary intervention (PCI)) or a surgical procedure (coronary artery by[CONTACT_13786]) designed to improve myocardial blood  flow.  
 Note : The underlying  condition should be reported as an AE  diagnosis.  
 Events leading to carotid  artery revascularisation : 
 Carotid artery stenosis leading to a surgical procedure (carotid artery 
endarterectomy  incl. angioplasty  and carotid artery stenting ).  
 Note : The underlying condition should be reported as an AE diagnosis.  
 Events leading to peripheral artery revascularisation : 
 Any type of  limb ischemia leading to  a catheter -based ( incl. endovascular 
procedures ) or a surgical procedure ( surgical thrombectom y/thromboendarterectomy  and/or 
peripheral by[CONTACT_508109] / surgical treatment of aortic aneurysm ) designed 
to improve blood flow to the limb.   
 Note : The underlying condition should be reported as an AE diagnosis.  
 Medication error  
 A medication error is an unintended failure in the IMP treatment process that leads 
to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient , such as:   
 Administration of wrong drug  
Note:  Use of wrong dispensing unit number ( DUN ) is not considered a medica tion error 
unless it results in administration of wrong drug   
 Wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of subcutaneous  
 Accidental administration of a lower or  higher dose than intended. The administered dose 
must deviate from the intended dose to an extent where clinical consequences for the trial 
patient  were likely to happen as judged by [CONTACT_093], although they did not 
necessarily occur.  
 Treatment pauses are allowed in the trial, this should not  be reported as a medication 
error . 
 Misuse and abuse   
 Situations where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with 
the protocol (e.g. overdose to maximise effect)

  Persist ent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of an IMP which is accompanied by 
[CONTACT_3584] (e.g. overdose with the intention to cause harm)  
Medication error, misuse and abuse must always be reported as an AE (e.g. accidental ove rdose, 
intentional overdose or other) on a separate AE form, and a medication error, misuse and abuse 
form must be completed. In case of a  medication error and/or misuse and abuse resulting in a 
clinical consequence (e.g. hypoglycaemia or other), this must  be reported on an additional AE 
form.  
 
10.3.4  Recording and follow -up of AE and/or SAE  
AE and SAE recording  
 SAEs and  AEs listed in Section  8.3 and AEs/SAEs in connection with pregnancies, must 
be recorded by [CONTACT_18042]. The investigator will attempt to establish a 
diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/ or other clinical information. In 
such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the 
AE/SAE.    
 When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385003] s, laboratory and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.  
 There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_14168] (e.g. medical records) for 
certain cases are requested by [CONTACT_3454]. In such cases, all patient  identifiers, with the 
exception of the patient number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_508064].  
 For all non -serious AEs, the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved 
or at the end of the trial at the latest. For sign -off of SAE related forms, refer to “AE and 
SAE reporting via paper CRF” later in this Section . 
 Novo Nordisk products used as concomitant medication: if an AE is considered to have a 
causal relationship with a Novo Nordisk marketed product used as  concomitant 
medication in the trial, it is important that the suspected relationship is reported to Novo 
Nordisk, e.g. in the alternative aetiology Section  on the safety information form. Novo 
Nordisk may need to report this adverse event to relevant regul atory authorities.  
 
Assessment of severity  
The investigator will assess severity for each event reported during the trial and assign it to one of 
the following categories:   
 Mild : An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_102] , causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.  
 Moderate : An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities.  
 Severe : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  
Note: An AE that is assessed as severe  should not be confused with a SAE. Both AEs and 
SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
 
Assessment of causality  
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between IMP and the occurrence of 
each AE/SAE.  
 Relationship between an AE/SAE and the rele vant IMP(s) should be assessed as:

  Probable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal 
relationship.  
 Possible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.  
 Unlikely - The event is most likely related to aetiology other  than the IMP.  
 Alternative aetiology, such  as underlying disease(s), concomitant medication, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to IMP administration, will 
be considered and investigated.

AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical records that he/she has reviewed 
the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
 There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and  the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report. However, it is important that the 
investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data.  
 The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_17963], in light of follow -up 
information, and update the causality assessment in the CRF.  
 The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
Final outcome  
The investigator will select the most appropriate outcome:  
 Recovered/resolved:  The patient  has fully recovered, or by [CONTACT_197675]  
 Recovering/resolving:  The condition is improving, and the patient  is expected to recover 
from the event. This term may be applicable in cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs 
ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE).   
 Note: For SAEs, this term is only applicable if the patient  has completed  the follow -
up period and is expected to recover.  
 Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The patient  has recovered from the condition but 
with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an 
SAE criterion, the AE must be r eported as an SAE.  
 Not recovered/not resolved:  The condition of the patient  has not improved, and the 
symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known.  
Note: This term may be applicable in cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing 
at time of d eath (where death is due to another AE).   
 Fatal:  This term is only applicable if the patient  died from a condition related to the 
reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a patient  before he/she died should be 
assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recov ering/resolving”, “ recovered/resolved with 
sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with a fatal outcome must be reported 
as an SAE.  
 Unknown:  This term is only applicable if the patient  is lost to follow -up. 
 
Follow -up of AE and SAE  
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements 
and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_18044]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible (e.g. seve re hypersensitivity reactions). 
This may include additional laboratory tests (e.g. skin prick test) or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.

 If a patient  dies during participation in the trial or during a recognised follow -up period, the 
investigator should provide Novo Nordisk with a copy of autopsy report including 
histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.  
 
10.3.5  Reporting of SAE s 
SAE reporting via electronic CRF  
 Relevant forms (AE and safety information f orm) must be completed in the CRF.  
 For reporting and sign -off timelines, see Figure  10-1 below.  
 If the CRF is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper AE form, 
and if the CRF is unavailable for more than 5 calendar days, then the site will use the 
safet y information form (see box below).  
 The site will enter the SAE data into the CRF as soon as it becomes available.  
 After the trial is completed, the trial database will be locked, and the CRF will be 
decommissioned to prevent the entry of new data or chang es to existing data. If a site 
receives a report of a new SAE from a patient  or receives updated data on a previously 
reported SAE after CRF decommission, then the site can report this information on a 
paper AE and safety information form (see box below) o r to Novo Nordisk by [CONTACT_756].  
 
AE and SAE reporting via paper CRF  
 Relevant CRF forms (AE and safety information form)  must be forwarded to Novo 
Nordisk in accordance with  Section  10.1.5 . 
 For SAEs, initial notification via telephone is acceptable, although it does not replace the 
need for the investigator to complete the AE and safety information form  within the 
designated rep orting timelines (as illustrated in the figure below):  
 AE form within 24 hours  
 Safety information form within 5 calendar days  
 Both forms must be signed within [ADDRESS_655648] knowledge by [CONTACT_1275].  
 The specific event form for AEs requiring additional data collection within 14 calendar 
days

 10.4 Appendix 4: Contraceptive guidance and collection of pregnancy information  
Definitions  
Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopaus al unless 
permanently sterile.   
If fertility is unclear (e.g. amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes), and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of trial treatment, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Females in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
1. Premenarcheal  
2. Females with one or more of the following:  
 Documented total hysterectomy  
 Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
 Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Females with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above (e.g. 
Müllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied in determining 
trial enrolment.  
3. Postmenopausal female:  
 A postmenopausal state is defined as amenorrhoea for 12 months without an alterna tive 
medical cause.  
 Females  ≥ 50 years of age can be considered postmenopausal (irrespective of treatment with 
a hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)) if they have both:  
▪ Amenorrhoea and  
▪ Documentation of 2 high follicle stimulating ho rmone (FSH) measurements in the 
postmenopausal range and one of these was observed ≥1 year prior to screening.  
 Females ≥ 60 years of age can be considered  postmenopausal.  
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt are considered of childbearing  potential 
and will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods  
(Table  10-3).  
Note: Documentation regarding categories 1-3 can come from the site staff ’s review of patient ’s 
medical records, medical examinat ion or medical history interview.  
Contraception guidance  
Male patient s  
No contraception measures are required for male patient s as the risk of teratogenicity/fetotoxicity 
caused by [CONTACT_508110].  
Female patient s 
Female patient s of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use methods of 
contraception consistently and correctly as described in Table  10-3 below:

 Table  10-3 Highly effective contraceptive methods  
CONTRACEPTIVESa ALLOWED DURING THE TRIAL INCLUDE:  
 Highly effective methodsb,f that have low user dependency  (Failure rate of <1% per  year when used 
consistently and correctly) : 
 Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb 
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)b 
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner  
(Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is 
the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential, and the absence of sperm has 
been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of cont raception should be used. 
Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.)  
 Highly effective methodsb,f that are user dependent  (Failure rate of <1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly) : 
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal con traception associated with 
inhibition of ovulationc 
o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
o injectable  
 Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the trial treatment. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial an d the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient . 
NOTES  
a) Contraceptive use by [CONTACT_111432].  
b) Failure rate of <1% per year whe n used consistently and correctly. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_31786].  
c) If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, 
contraceptive methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of 
action.  
d) Contraception should be utilised during the treatment period and for at least 5 weeks  
(corresponding to time needed to eliminate trial product) after the last dose of trial product. 
This period should be extended by 30 days in case of genotoxicity.  
 
In certain cases, it is accepted to use double barrier methods (a condom combined with an occlusive 
cap (e.g. diaphragm) with/without the use of spermicide). This should only be allowed in females 
with:  
1. known intolerance to the highly effective methods mentioned in Table  10-3 or where the use of 
any of the listed highly effective contraceptive measures are contraindicated in the individual 
patient , and/or  
2. if the risk of initiating treatment with a specific highly effective method outweighs the benefit 
for the female.

 Justifica tion for accepting double barrier method should be at the discretion of the investigator 
taking into consideration his/her knowledge about the female’s medical history, concomitant illness, 
concomitant medication and observed AEs. The justification must be  stated in the medical records.  
For country specific requirements, please see Appendix 8 (Section  10.8). 
Pregnancy testing  
 WOCBP should only be inclu ded after a negative highly sensitive urine pregnancy test (refer to 
Appendix 2 , Section  10.2). 
 Additional urine pregnancy testing should be performed at end of treatment (V8) or at 
premature end of treatment (V8A) according to the flowchart.  
 Pregnancy testing should be performed whenever a menstruation is missed or when pregnancy 
is otherwise suspec ted. 
 Additional pregnancy testing should be performed during the treatment period, if required 
locally (Appendix 8, Section  10.8). 
Collection of preg nancy information   
Female patient s who become pregnant   
 Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient  who becomes pregnant 
while participating in this trial.  
 Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to Novo Nordisk within 14 
calendar days of learning of a patient 's pregnancy (see Figure  10-2). 
 Patient  will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator will 
collect follow -up information on patient  and neonate which will be forwarded to Novo Nordisk 
within 14 calendar days. Generally, follow -up will not be requi red for longer than 1 month 
beyond the delivery date.  
 Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of foetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any adverse event in connection 
with pregnancy or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an 
AE or SAE. If relevant, consider adding ‘gestational’, ‘pregnancy related’ or a similar term 
when reporting the AE/SAE.  
 Pregnan cy outcome should be documented in the patient 's medical record. Abnormal pregnancy 
outcome (e.g. spontaneous abortion, foetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies and ectopic 
pregnancy) is considered an SAE.  
 Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -trial pregnancy which is considered possibly/probably 
related to the IMP by [CONTACT_111433] 3 ( Section  10.3). While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former patient s, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

 10.5 Appendix 5: Technical complaints: Definition and procedures for recording, 
evaluation, follow -up and reporting  
10.5.1  Definition of technical complaint  
Technical complaint definition  
 A technical complaint  is any written, electronic or oral communication that alleges 
product (medicine or device) defects. The technical complaint may be associated with an 
AE but does not concern the AE itself.  
Examples of technical complaints:  
 Problems with the physical or chemical appearance of trial products (e.g. discoloratio n, 
particles or contamination)  
 Problems with packaging material including labelling  
 Problems related to devices (e.g. to the injection mechanism, dose setting mechanism, push 
button or interface between the pen -injector and the needle)  
Time period for detecting technical complaints  
All technical complaints  which occur from the time of receipt of the product at site until the time 
of the last usage of the product must be collected for products predefined on the technical 
complaint form.  
 
10.5.[ADDRESS_655650] be reported on a separate technical complaint form:  
6. One technical complaint form must be completed for each affected DUN.  
7. If DUN is not available, a technical complaint form for each batch, code or lot number must be 
completed.  
 
Timelines for reporting of technical complaints to Novo Nordisk  
The investigator must complete the technical complaint form in the CRF within:  
 24 hours if related to an SAE  
 [ADDRESS_655651] enter the information on the technical complaint form in the 
CRF.  
 
Follow -up of technical complaints  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that new or updated information will be recorded on 
the originally completed form.

 10.6 Appendix 6: Retention of human biosamples  
As new biomarkers related to the disease and/or safety, efficacy or mechanism of action of  
semaglutide  may evolve during the conduct of the trial, the analyses of the stored biosampl es may 
also include biomarkers that are unknown at present or have not been included in the scientific 
hypotheses at initiation of the trial.  
In countries where allowed, the trial will invol ve collection of human biosamples  to be stored in a 
central archi ve (perhaps in another country) for future use as noted in Section  8.8. 
The following samples will be stored:  
 plasma  
 serum  
The samples will be stored at a secure central bio -repository after end of trial and until the research 
project terminates, but no longer th an [ADDRESS_655653] access to the stored samples.  
Patients may withdraw from the biobank compon ent of the trial  at any time, independent of 
participation in the trial. If a patient withdraws from the biobank component all stored biosamples 
obtained from their own body will be destroyed.  
Confidentiality and personal data protection will be ensured during storage after the end of trial . 
In the event that the collected biosamples will be used in the future , care will be taken to target 
analyses within the scope defined in Section  8.8.

In the countries mentioned above, t he investigator may, after obtaining separate informed consent, 
perform pre -screening activities to identify potential study participants  based on ABI and/or TBI 
(inclusion criterion # 4d). Pre-screening is optional and participants must sign a separate informed 
consent form to participate.  It is not necessary to obtain informed consent for the full study before 
pre-screening.  The requirements for the informed consent process are the same as those outlined in 
Section 10.1.3 . 
Pre-screening assessments may include : 
 Measurement of ABI and/or TBI . 
 Review  of medical history and concomitant medication , including the option to review medical 
records obtained from relevant sources such as primary care physicians and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] .  
 
Pre-screening assessments are not defined as study -related procedures.  Results of pre -screening will 
not be collected in the study database . Concerns related to any pre -screening assessment should  not 
be reported as an AE.  
It is encouraged that potential participants wh o are determined to be potentially eligible for the 
study should proceed to screening (visit  1) as soon as possible and preferably within 1  month of 
pre-screening. If the candidate  is deemed potentially eligible for participation in the study, all 
assessme nts and information required for screening (visit 1) must be collected in accordance with 
the flowchart (Section 1.2). 
The investigator must maintain a pre -screening log to record details of all candidates who were 
pre-screened and to track the outcome of the pre -screening .

 3. SYNOPSIS 
This is a brief summary.  For details refer to the body of the protocol. 
Protocol Number: 997HA309  
Protocol Title: A Randomized, Open -Label Study to Evaluate the 
Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Recombinant Facto r VIII Fc 
Fusion Protein (rFVIIIFc; BIIB031) Manufactured  at 15K 
Scale and at Different Vial Strengths in Previously Treated 
Subjects with Severe Hemophilia A  
Version Number:  1 
Name [CONTACT_71413] : rFVIIIFc (Eloctate ; Elocta; BIIB031) 
Study Indicati on: Hemophilia A  
Phase of Development : 3b 
Rationale for the Study:  Biogen is increasing the scale of manufacture of rFVIIIFc 
drug substance from  a 2000 L (2K) to a 15,000 L (15K) 
bioreactor .  In addition, at the 15K scale, Biogen is 
increasing the highes t manufactured vial strength from 
3000 IU/vial to 6000 IU/vial , to provide more vial strength 
options. 
The purpose of this study is to compare the PK of rFVIIIFc 
drug product manufactured at the 15K scale with the PK of 
rFVIIIFc manufactured at the current  scale (2K).  The study 
will also characterize the PK of rFVIIIFc 15K product in 
1000 IU vials and 6000 IU vials, characterize the PK of 15K 
rFVIIIFc after 13 weeks of prophylactic  dosing, and 
evaluate the safety of 15K rFVIIIFc during extended 
prophylaxis /treatment for at least 26 weeks. This study is 
designed to be in accordance with the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) requirements for clinical investigation of 
recombinant and human plasma -derived factor VIII products 
[EMA (EMA/CHMP/B PWP/144533/2009) 2011 ].

assay and the two -stage chromogenic assay.  
PK parameter s will be assessed for the following  
 15K rFVIIIFc at the 15K baseline  (i.e., at PK2) 
and after 13 weeks of treatment  (at 
pharmacokinetic assessment 3, with 15K 
rFVIIIFc [ PK3]) 
 15K rFVIIIFc at 1000 IU/vial and 6000 IU/vial  
strengths 
 2K rFVIIIFc (at PK1) and 15K rFVIIIFc (at 
PK2) [except AUC inf and IR, which are i ncluded 
in the primary endpoint]  
2. Development of inhibitors as measured by [CONTACT_471591] -modified Bethesda assay  
3. Evaluation  of adverse events ( AEs) and serious 
adverse events ( SAEs) 
Study Design:  Overview:  
This is an open -label, multicenter, randomized study.  A 
minimum of [ADDRESS_604430] 150 exposure days (150 EDs) to any FVIII 
product will complete [ADDRESS_604431] PK assessments of 2K 
rFVIIIFc at the 1000 IU/vial  strength (PK1) followed by [CONTACT_471592] 15K rFVIIIFc (1000 IU/vial  strength) 
or 15K rFVIIIFc (6000 IU/vial strength) at PK2.  After 
13 weeks of treatment  with15K rFVIIIFc (1000 IU/vial or 
6000 IU/vial strength) will be re -evaluated at 
Pharmacokinetic assessment 3 (PK3) .  Following PK3, 
subjects will continue prophylactic dosing  until they reach 
26 weeks of treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc  (total, starting 
from the PK2 assessment) . 
Protocol 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604432]  (or the sub ject’s caregiver)  
will maintain throughout the study.  
After completion of the study , eligible subjects living in 
countries where rFVIIIFc is not commercially available will 
be offered enrollment into extension study 8HA01EXT.   
Screening, PK Asse ssments, T reatment, and Follow -Up: 
Pharmacokinetic Assessment 1 (PK1):   Subjects will 
undergo washout ( [ADDRESS_604433]) prior to the first PK assessment.  Following 
screening and washout, all subjects will undergo a 96 -hour 
PK assessment with 50 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc manufactured at 
the 2K scale using 1000 IU/ vial.   
Pharmacokinetic Assessment 2 (PK2):   It is recommended 
that the second PK assessment be performed within [ADDRESS_604434].  However, prophylaxis and treatment 
of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471554], provided that subjects undergo a minimum of 
120 hours of washout of rFVIIIFc prior to the PK2 
assessment.  
Subjects will be randomize d in a 1:1 ratio to 2 groups for the 
second PK assessment:   
 Group 1 will receive 15K rFVIIIFc (1000 IU/vial  
strength), 50 IU/kg.  
 Group 2 will receive 15K rFVIIIFc (6000 IU/vial  
strength), 50 IU/kg.  
Treatment Period (TP):   After PK2, subjects will begin 
receiving treatment  with rFVIIIFc (15K vials), for at least 
26 weeks.  After 13 weeks in the treatment period, subjects 
will undergo washout in preparation for the PK3 
assessment.  Following the PK3 assessment, they will 
resume treatment , until they reach a minimum of 26 weeks. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessment 3 (PK3):   Subjects will 
undergo a minimum of [ADDRESS_604435] PK 
assessment with 15K rFVIIIFc (50 IU/kg) at the same vial 
Protocol 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604436].  
Rationale for Dose and 
Schedule Selection:  The 50 IU/kg dose was  used in the Phase 3 Study 
(997HA301)  PK assessment and is consistent with the EMA 
guidance [EMA (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) 2011 ]. 
Prophylactic  treatment dose and regimen:  
Following PK [ADDRESS_604437] ’s response and will be at the 
Investigator’s discretion.   Subjects may use any of 
5 available 15K vial strengths during the treatment phase .   
Suggested prophylactic starting dosing regimens are : 
 50 IU/kg every 3  to 5 days  
OR  
 65 IU/kg weekly   
The proposed prophylactic  starting regimens are based on 
the results of the Phase 3 study (997HA301) in adults and 
adolescents .   
Vial Strength  
The EMA guidance [EMA 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) 2011 ] requires that, for 
products marketed at different strengths, the 
pharmacokinetics of the lowest and highest concentration 
should be investigated unless otherwise justified.  
The 1000 IU /vial strength was chosen as the lowest strength 
for this study following CHMP agreement that it is the  
lowest strength suitable for PK assessment at a dose of 
50 IU/kg, although vial strengths as low as 250 IU are 
produced.   
The 6000 IU/vial strength was selected as the highest 
Protocol 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604438] vial strength 
of 15K rFVIIIFc currently intended for commercialization.  
Study Location:  Multinational (approximately 3 countries)  
Number of Planned Subjects:  Approximate ly 24 enrolled subjects (12 in Group 1 and 
12 in Group 2) are planned, in order to obtain the necessary 
number of evaluable subjects as defined in Section 7.5.   
Study Population:  This study will be conducted in subjects who are male 
previously treate d patients (PTPs) ≥12 years of age with 
severe hemophilia A (FVIII <1%) and ≥150 EDs to any 
recombinant and/or plasma -derived FVIII and/or 
cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_471555].  
Detailed criteria are described in Section  8. 
Treatment Groups : Treatment of approximately 24 subjects is planned .   
All subjects will undergo  an initial PK assessment with 
rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 2K scale (1000 IU/vial) [PK1].   
On Day 1 of PK 1, subjects will be randomized  (for the 
purposes of th e subsequent  PK2 and PK3 assessments) to 
[ADDRESS_604439] manufactured at the 15K scale:  
 Group 1 will receive 15K rFVIIIFc (1000 IU 
vials) for PK2 and PK3.   
 Group 2 will receive 15K rFVIIIFc (6000 IU 
vials) for PK2 and PK3.   
In the treatment period that follows PK2, all subjects will 
receive treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc for a minimum  of 
26 weeks, during which time subjects will be offered the 
option of prophylactic treatment .   
Duration of Treatment a nd 
Follow-Up: The duration of a subject’s participation will be 
approximately 43 weeks, including up to 8 weeks of 
screening, 3 PK assessments, a minimum of 26 weeks of 
prophylactic dosing , and a follow -up telephone  call 7 (+7) 
days after the last dose of rFVIIIFc during the Treatment 
Period.  A subject’s participation in the study may be 
extended due to the treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471556] 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604440]

 surgery. 
Criteria for Evaluation :   
Pharmacokinetics:  
 
 
 
 FVIII activity will be assessed using  the following assay s: 
 One-stage (aPTT)  clotting assay  
 Two-stage chromogenic assay  
PK parameters will include but not be limited to AUC inf, IR, 
Cmax, t½, CL, Vss, and MRT . 
Safety: The safety profile of rFVIIIFc  will be assessed based on  the 
following criteria : 
 Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay for the 
development of inhibitors  
 AEs and SAEs 
Statistical Methods: 
 Natural log transformed primary PK endpoints (AUC inf [if 
data permit] and IR following rFVIIIFc dosing for 2K and 
15K at the 15K baseline  measured by [CONTACT_71346]-stage (aPTT) 
clotting assay) will be analyzed using a mixed effect model 
with period and treatment as fixed effects and subject as a 
random effect.  Estimates of the  adjusted mean differences 
(15K/2K) and corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) 
will be obtaine d from the model.  The adjusted mean 
differences and 90% CIs for the differences will be back 
transformed (exponentiated) to provide estimates of the ratio 
of adjusted geometric means (15K/2K) and 90% CIs for the 
ratios.   
For descriptive purposes only, si milar analyses may be 
performed for the other secondary PK parameters measured 
by [CONTACT_71346]-stage (aPTT)  assay and for all relevant PK 
parameters measured by [CONTACT_112913] -stage chromogenic assay.   
Comparability of the 2 manufacturing scales will be 
concluded if the 90% CIs for the ratio of adjusted geometric 
means for both AUC inf and IR fall within the range of (68%, 
146%). 
In addition, t he PK endpoints (including AUC inf, IR, Cmax,

 t1/2, CL, V ss, and MRT) will be summarized descr iptively by 
[CONTACT_206343] , vial strength, and by [CONTACT_471593] 
(one-stage [aPTT] clotting assay and two -stage chromogenic 
assay).  Summary statistics will  include, but not be limited 
to the mean, CI, standard deviation, median, minimum  and 
maximum values and the geometric means (anti log of the 
means of the logs) and coefficients of variation.  
Safety endpoints , including AEs and SAEs , will be 
summarized descriptively using standard listings.  
The occurrence of inhibitors will be provided in a listing.  
Interim Analysis:  Interim analyses  of PK and/or safety data may be conducted 
during the study , for example,  as required to support 
regulatory submissions, future studies, and/or publications.  
Sample Size Determination:  The sample size is consistent with the EMA guidance for 
PK assessment of hemophilia products, and has sufficient 
power to demonstrate comparability between the primary 
PK endpoints . 
Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  Biogen may terminate this study  for safety reasons  at any 
time, after informing Investigators.  The study will be 
discontinued if an unacceptable risk is identified that 
precludes continued treatment with rFVIIIFc.

 5. INTRODUCTION  
Study 997HA309 is designed to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rFVIIIFc 
manufactured at the 15K scale re lative to the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the current scale 
(2K).  The study will also characterize the PK of 15K rFVIIIFc in [ADDRESS_604475] vial 
strength currently intended for commercialization, and the lower, 1000 IU vial strength, in 
accordance with European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidance [EMA 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) 2011 ].  The study will provide [ADDRESS_604476] of eligible male, 
previously treated subjects aged ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A.   
Overview of Hemophilia A  
Hemophilia A is an X-chromosome-linked bleeding disorder caused by [CONTACT_72848]/or 
deletions in the F8 gene resulting in a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) activity 
[Bolton-Maggs and Pasi 2003 ; Mannucci and Tuddenham 2001 ].  The coagulation disorder 
occurs predominantly in males and affects approximately 1 in 5,000 male births [Skinner 2012 ]. 
The severity of disease is characterized by [CONTACT_471594].  Severe hemophilia A is defined as a coagulation activity of FVIII in plasma (FVIII:C) 
level of <1% (<1 IU/dL).  Individuals with severe hemophilia A experience frequent bleeding 
and recurrent spontaneous bleeding into the soft tissue and joints, leading to joint damage and 
severe disability.  Repeated bleeding into muscles and joints, which often begins in early 
childhood, results in hemophilic arthropathy and irreversible joint damage.  Damage can lead to 
limited mobility of joints, muscle atrophy, and chronic pain [Rodriguez-Merchan 2003 ]. 
FVIII and factor IX work in concert to activate factor X, a central step in the clotting cascade.  
The coagulation cascade has [ADDRESS_604477] (Intrinsic Pathway) 
and the Tissue Factor Pathway (Extrinsic Pathway).  The plasma factors are activated in a 
cascade one after the other until the soluble plasma protein fibrinogen is transformed into a 
fibrinous clot. 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_71229] A  
There is no cure for hemophilia A, so treatment focuses on the replacement of FVIII with the 
intravenous (IV) administration of FVIII-containing coagulation products to promote clotting.  
The goal of treatment with FVIII-containing coagulation products is to raise the circulating level 
of FVIII to the lowest effective level to achieve either resolution of bleeding (on-demand 
treatment) or prevention of bleeding (prophylactic treatment) [MASAC 2009 ; WFH 2005 ].  The 
frequency of administration of FVIII products varies across patients and is tailored to the 
patient’s clinical status, taking into consideration the type of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], frequency of 
bleeding, and goal of treatment for the subject.  The dose of FVIII required also varies and has 
been based on observations over the years as well as guidelines established by [CONTACT_471595] 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604478]

 as the National Hemophilia Foundation of the [LOCATION_002] and the World Federation of 
Hemophilia [WFH 2005 ]. 
The use of FVIII-containing plasma-derived coagulation products for people with hemophilia A, 
available for almost [ADDRESS_604479] improvements in quality of life and has increased 
life expectancy.  Manufacturing methods for plasma-derived products are now considered to be 
highly effective in reducing the risk of transmission of enveloped viruses such as human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C.  However, these methods may not be 
effective in reducing the risk of nonenveloped viruses, such as hepatitis A and parvovirus B19.  
Recombinant coagulation products developed more recently with no animal or human 
plasma-derived proteins have a safety advantage with a minimal risk of disease transmission 
[Mannucci and Tuddenham 2001 ]. 
Priorities for improving hemophilia A therapy include the development of more convenient 
dosing options and development of modified FVIII agents with longer half-life (t½) to decrease 
injection frequency.  Current therapy is focused on home therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which, taken 
prophylactically or administered at the onset of a bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], reduce short-term disability 
and long-term joint damage and improve patients’ quality of life and functional independence 
[Colvin 2008 ].  
rFVIIIFc is a novel recombinant Fc fusion protein comprised of a single molecule of B domain 
deleted FVIII attached to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1).  This type of 
construct has been termed a monomeric Fc fusion protein [ Dumont 2006 ].  The Fc enables 
binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for protecting 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) from degradation and confers IgG the 3-week t½ observed in humans 
[Ghetie and Ward 2000 ; Roopenian and Akilesh 2007 ].  The FcRn is present in humans 
throughout life and protects IgG from catabolism [Junghans and Anderson 1996 ].  rFVIIIFc was 
designed to offer a longer circulating t½ than currently available FVIII products, aiming to 
provide hemophilia A patients with prolonged protection and prophylaxis from bleeding with 
less frequent dosing. 
rFVIIIFc has marketing authorization for the treatment of individuals with hemophilia A in the 
[LOCATION_002] and several additional countries.

Investigator’s Brochure. 
Clinical Experience 
Study 998HA101, a completed Phase 1/2a study, investigated the safety and PK of a single dose 
of rFVIIIFc given as an IV injection to subjects with severe hemophilia A and compared the PK 
of rFVIIIFc with Advate® (antihemophilic factor [Recombinant], Plasma/Albumin-Free Method, 
[INN] octocog alfa).  PK profiles were performed for Advate at 2 dose levels (25 and 65 IU/kg), 
followed by [CONTACT_471596].  rFVIIIFc was well tolerated.  No 
clinically significant changes in safety parameters occurred and most adverse events (AEs) were 
mild and resolved without sequelae by [CONTACT_2054].  No subject developed antibodies or 
inhibitors during the study period.  Compared with Advate, rFVIIIFc demonstrated significantly 
longer t½, increased systemic exposure, and a reduction in CL, with comparable C max and 
recovery.    
Study 997HA301, a Phase 3 study in previously treated subjects aged 12 years or older with 
severe hemophilia A, has also been completed.  A total of 164 subjects (including 13 subjects 
aged 12 to 17 years) received at least [ADDRESS_604481]-years 
on study.  Compared with Advate, rFVIIIFc demonstrated improved PK activity, as indicated by 
a 53% longer t ½, a 56% increase in systemic exposure, and a 36% reduction in CL, with 
comparable C max and incremental recovery (one-stage [aPTT] clotting assay).  rFVIIIFc was well 
tolerated.  No subject developed an inhibitor to rFVIIIFc.  Common AEs observed were 
consistent with those expected in patients with hemophilia A.  Adverse drug reactions were 
generally mild and manageable, and the majority were not treatment limiting.  One nonserious 
event of rash required discontinuation of treatment and resolved.  There were no Grade 2 or 
greater allergic reactions or serious vascular thrombotic events.  No treatment-related SAEs were 
observed.   
Study 8HA02PED (referred to as the pediatric study) is a completed, open-label, multicenter 
study evaluating the safety, PK, and efficacy of rFVIIIFc in previously treated pediatric patients 
with severe hemophilia A who were <[ADDRESS_604482] 50 exposure days (EDs) to 
FVIII products prior to enrollment.  A total of 71 male subjects enrolled (36 subjects <6 years of 
age and 35 subjects 6 to <12 years of age).  A total of 60 subjects completed the week 26 visit 
(i.e., [ADDRESS_604483]) to attain at least 50 EDs.  A total of 
53 subjects (23 subjects <6 years of age and 30 subjects 6 to <12 years of age) underwent an 
evaluation of the PK profile of both prestudy FVIII and rFVIIIFc.  No subject developed an 
inhibitor during the study, including [ADDRESS_604484] 50 EDs to rFVIIIFc. There were no 
reports of anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity events associated with rFVIIIFc; and no 
vascular thrombotic events were reported.  Assessment of the PK of rFVIIIFc revealed 12.28 and 
13.45 hours t½ for the <6 years of age cohort and 6 to <[ADDRESS_604485]

 hemophilia A, who are ≥12 years of age and had >[ADDRESS_604486] 12 subjects 
provide evaluable PK profiles for both vial strengths being tested (1000 IU/vial and 3000 
IU/vial). 
Study 8HA01EXT (referred to as the extension study) is an open-label, multicenter extension to 
both the Phase 3 study (997HA301) and the pediatric study (8HA02PED), as well as to other 
studies in which subjects have received rFVIIIFc.  The extension study is evaluating the 
long-term safety and efficacy of rFVIIIFc for prophylaxis and epi[INVESTIGATOR_471559] (PTPs) with hemophilia A.   
For further details regarding the clinical studies conducted with rFVIIIFc, see the rFVIIIFc 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
5.2. Study Rationale 
Biogen is increasing the scale of manufacture of rFVIIIFc drug substance from 2000 L (2K) to 
15,000 L (15K).  The purpose of this study is to compare the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 
15K scale with the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the current scale (2K), in order to investigate 
whether there were any effects of changes in the manufacturing process on the activity of 
rFVIIIFc.  In addition, at the 15K scale, Biogen is increasing the highest manufactured vial 
strength from 3000 IU/vial to 6000 IU/vial.  The study will also characterize the PK of 15K 
rFVIIIFc in 1000 IU and  6000 IU vials, will characterize the PK of 15K rFVIIIFc after 13 weeks 
of prophylactic dosing, and will evaluate safety of 15K rFVIIIFc during the extended 
prophylaxis/treatment for at least [ADDRESS_604487]. 
This study is designed to be in accordance with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
requirements for clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor VIII 
products [EMA (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) 2011 ], particular ly with regard to the 
following:
 
 A PK assessment of the pre-change product (i.e., 2K rFVIIIFc) versus the post-
change product (i.e., 15K rFVIIIFc) will be performed.   
 A PK assessment of the post-change product (i.e., rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K 
scale) after 13 weeks of dosing will be performed.   
 Subjects will complete a minimum of 26 weeks of dosing with 15K rFVIIIFc.  
 The PK of the lowest and highest vial strengths is being investigated.  Although vial 
strengths as low as 250 IU are produced, the 1000 IU/vial strength was chosen for this 
study because it is the lowest strength suitable for PK assessment at a dose of 
Protocol 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604488]  
 
CONFIDENTIAL

Biogen MA Inc. 
34 
 50 IU/kg.  The [ADDRESS_604489] vial strength intended for 
commercialization and, therefore,  was selected for this study.   
5.3. Rationale for Dose and Schedule Selection 
The dose for the PK assessments  (50 IU/kg) is within the 25 to 50 IU/kg specified in EMA 
guidance [EMA (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) 2011 ] and is the same as that used in the 
Phase 3 study (997HA301) for PK assessment. 
In the treatment period that follows PK2, all subjects will receive a minimum of [ADDRESS_604490]’s response and will be at the 
Investigator's discretion.   The recommended dosing regimens are as follows: 
 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc every 3 to 5 days.  The dose may be adjusted in the range of 25 to 
65 IU/kg at 3 to 5 day intervals.   
 65 IU/kg rFVIIIFc once weekly

 7. STUDY DESIGN 
7.1. Study Overview 
This will be a randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the PK of a single dose of 
rFVIIIFc manufactured at 2 different scales (2K and 15K) and 15K rFVIIIFc.  PK of rFVIIIFc 
produced at different vial strengths will be evaluated at the 15K baseline (PK2) and after 
13 weeks on the study (PK3).  Subjects will receive treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc for at least 
26 weeks while on study, and will be followed for safety during that time.  Subjects will be PTPs 
who are ≥[ADDRESS_604494] PK assessment (PK1) subjects will undergo a minimum washout period of 
96 hours (for short-acting products) or 120 hours (for long-acting products).  In the event that 
bleeding occurs during the washout period, the subject must repeat the washout.  
Subjects will then undergo the PK1 assessment with 2K rFVIIIFc (a single IV injection of 
50 IU/kg using 1000 IU/vial material).  During the PK1 assessment period, subjects will also be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1000 IU/kg or 6000 IU/kg of 15K rFVIIIFc (a single 
IV injection of 50 IU/kg) in the subsequent PK2 and PK3 assessments.  If more than [ADDRESS_604495] (Section 10.1.1).  There are no limits on the number of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471560]2 and PK3 assessment period s.  Subjects who cannot complete all 3 PK 
assessments may continue to the 26-week Treatment Period.    
After PK2 (irrespective of PK evaluability), subjects will begin treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc for 
at l
east 26 weeks (Section 10.1.2).  During treatment, subjects will be offered prophylaxis 
(dosing either every 3 to 5 days or once-weekly) using 15K rFVIIIFc.  Subjects will be allowed 
to switch from one regimen to another if approved by [CONTACT_471598].   
After [ADDRESS_604496] PK assessment (PK3) with the same vial 
streng
th of 15K rFVIIIFc that the subject previously received.  The subject will continue to 
receive 15K rFVIIIFc for a minimum of [ADDRESS_604497] 48 hours is recommended.  Inhibitor testing will 
be performed at screening, prior to each PK dose (or at the 14 week ± [ADDRESS_604498] at 13 weeks; see Section 4.2.3), and at the Final Study Visit.  If inhibitor development 
is suspected at any time during the study (for example, if the expected plasma FVIII activity 
levels are not attained or if bleeding is not controlled as expected following dosing), inhibitor 
testing
 will be performed by [CONTACT_2237].  The definition of a positive result for 
inhibitor is any inhibitor (≥0.6 BU/mL) identified and confirmed on [ADDRESS_604499] with rFVIIIFc, an exploratory 
assay that differentiates between antibodies with specificities for rFVIIIFc, full-length FVIII 
(Advate), or Fc will be used to test for the presence of anti-drug antibody in study subjects.  The 
electrochemiluminescent assay used for this test is approximately 10- to 20-fold more sensitive 
than the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay.  At the same timepoints when samples are drawn 
for inhibitor testing, a blood sample will be collected for testing of anti-rFVIIIFc antibody (see 
Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.2.3).   
7.3. Overall Study Duration and Follow-Up  
The study period will consist of screening,  [ADDRESS_604500]

 FVIII for a bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 4 days (96 hours) prior to the first injection on Day [ADDRESS_604501] be repeated to ensure continued eligibility.  
The reason for prolongation of screening should be clearly documented. 
Eligibility should be assessed for all criteria pending the central laboratory screening results at 
screening and should be re-confirmed prior to Day 1 of PK1.   
7.3.2. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
A washout period with no FVIII treatment will be required prior to each injection of rFVIIIFc for 
all PK assessments (96 hours for short-acting products or 120 hours for long-acting products).   
Eligible subjects will report to the study site for the PK assessments.  Every subject is expected 
to participate in all 3 PK assessments:  
 PK1: At the first visit, the subject will receive a single IV injection of 2K rFVIIIFc 
(50 IU/kg of 1000 IU/vial) in the clinic under medical supervision.  PK sampling will 
occur just before the PK injection and at 7 time points:  0.5 hour (±5 minutes); 1 hour 
and 6 hours (±10 minutes); and 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours (±60 minutes).  The subject 
will receive 50 IU/kg of 15K rFVIIIFc at either the 1000 IU/vial or 6000 IU/vial 
strength in subsequent PK assessments.  
 PK2: The second PK assessment will be performed, preferably, within [ADDRESS_604502] before the PK injection 
and at 7 time points:  0.5 hour (±5 minutes); 1 hour and 6 hours (±10 minutes); and 
24, 48, 72, and 96 hours (±60 minutes) after each injection.   
 PK3: After 13 weeks (14 weeks ± 1 week) on treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc, the 
subject will have a third PK assessment at the same vial strength as in PK2.  PK 
sampling will occur just before the PK injection and at 7 time points:  0.5 hour (±5 
minutes); 1 hour and 6 hours (±10 minutes); and 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours (±60 
minutes) after each injection.   
7.3.3. Treatment 
Subjects will receive supplies of rFVIIIFc from the study site for home administr ation, either at 
study site visits for PK assessments or between study visits consistent with Section 11.  Subjects 
will be provided rFVIIIFc for a total of at least [ADDRESS_604503] been reached (Section 7.5).  After that time, eligible subjects living in countries

 where rFVIIIFc is not commercially available will be offered enrollment into extension study 
8HA01EXT.    
Dosing regimens are described in detail in Section 10.1.2.    
7.3.4. Follow-Up 
There will be a Follow- up Telephone Call 7 (+7) days after the last dose of rFVIIIFc during the 
Treatment Period, unless the subject has entered directly into extension study 8HA01EXT by 
[CONTACT_14713].   
7.4. Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_471561], after informing Investigators.  
Biogen (or designee) will notify Investigators when the study is to be placed on hold, completed, 
or terminated.   The study will be discontinued if an unacceptable risk is identified that precludes 
continued treatment with rFVIIIFc. 
7.5. End of Study 
The study will be considered complete when  
 At least 16 subjects (8 in each arm) have evaluable PK data AND  
 At least [ADDRESS_604505] 26 weeks of treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc.   
When this occurs, all ongoing subjects will return to the clinic for end-of-study assessments (see 
Section 4.2.3).  End of study will occur when the last subject has had his last visit (Last Subject 
Last Visit [LSLV]).

 9. ENROLLMENT, REGISTRATION, AND RANDOMIZATION 
9.1. Screening and Enrollment 
Subjects (or their legally authorized representative [e.g., parent or legal guardian], where 
applicable) must provide informed consent/assent before any screening tests are performed (see 
Section 17.3).  Participating study sites are required to document all screened candidates initially 
considered for inclusion in this study.  If a subject is excluded from the study, the reasons for 
exclusion will be documented in the subject’s source documents and on the screening log.  
Subjects will be registered as screened in the Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IXRS) 
following completion of all screening assessments. 
The Screening Period can be extended for subjects who have a bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471564] 1 of PK1 
Injection 1 (see Section 7.3.1  for details). 
Once the required washout is complete and all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been met 
(see Section 8.1 and Section 8.2), the subject will be enrolled into the study and randomized as 
described in Section 9.2. 
Discontinued subjects or subjects unable to complete all [ADDRESS_604515] may begin treatment prior to assignment of a unique identification number (registration).  
Any subject identification numbers that are assigned will not be reused even if the subject does 
not receive treatment.  As confirmation, the Investigator will receive written verification of the 
subject’s registration by [CONTACT_166740].   
Subjects will be randomized on Day 1 of PK1 via the IXRS.  The randomization will determine 
their PK2 and PK3 group assignments, to 1 of 2 groups, in a 1:1 ratio.  Subjects will receive 
either 1000  IU/vial or 6000 IU/vial of 15K rFVIIIFc.  
Refer to the Study Reference Guide for details on registration and randomization.

 10. STUDY TREATMENT 
The Sponsor will provide rFVIIIFc to sites via its designated distributors. 
Refer to Section 11 for specifics on the preparation, storage, handling, disposal, and 
accountability of study treatment. 
10.1. Treatment Schedule 
Refer to and follow the Directions for Handling and Administration (DHA).   
Refer to Figure 1 for a schematic of the study design and to Section 4.2 for study schedules.   
During the PK assessment, rFVIIIFc injections will be prepared and administered in the clinic by 
[CONTACT_3462].  During the Treatment Period, rFVIIIFc injections will be prepared and 
administered at home.     
10.1.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
The PK assessments will be performed following a single dose of rFVIIIFc, as follows: 
 PK1: 2K rFVIIIFc, 1000 IU/vial, 50 IU/kg 
 PK2 and PK3:  
o Group 1 will receive 15K rFVIIIFc, 1000 IU/vial, 50 IU/kg for both 
assessments. 
o Group 2 will receive 15K rFVIIIFc, 6000 IU/vial, 50 IU/kg for both 
assessments. 
Assignment of study treatment kits appropriate to a particular subject’s PK assessment is 
described in Section 11.1.4 .  
Following the minimum washout ([ADDRESS_604517] such as rFVIIIFc) and confirmation of eligibility, subjects 
will receive their first injection of rFVIIIFc (on Day 1 of PK1).  At the time of the PK1 
assessment, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 15K rFVIIIFc at either the 
1000 IU/vial or the 6000 IU/vial strength in the subsequent PK2 and PK3 assessments.   
Treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471565]1 assessment.  Prophylaxis and 
treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471566]1 and PK2 if needed.  
S
ubjects must use only 2K 1000 IU/vial rFVIIIFc and must undergo a minimum of [ADDRESS_604518] prior to the injection and at the following 
timepoints:  0.5  hour (±5 minutes); 1 hour and 6 hours (±10 minutes); and 24, 48, 72, and 
96 hours (±60 minutes) after each injection.  In cases of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471567], subjects should be treated according to Table 1  and Table 2.  There will be a limit of 
2 bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (i.e., a total of 3 attempts to perform the PK as sessment) for PK1, but no 
limit on the number of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471568]2 and PK3 (see Table 1).  If PK assessments 
cannot be completed, the subject will enter the Treatment Period (see Section 10.1.2) and may be 
replaced. 
Subjects who experience a bleed during a PK sampling period should complete the required 
washout and reschedule the planned PK injection followed by [CONTACT_471603].  Instructions for handling bleeding

10.1.2. Treatment  Period 
After completing the PK2 assessment, a ll subjects (whether or not evaluable for PK) will begin 
receiving treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc exclusively.  Subjects will receive prophylactic dosing.  
The specific choice of regimen for any given subject and any subsequent dose adjustments will 
be based on the subject’s response and will be at the Investigator’s discretion.  Subjects may use 
an
y of 5 available 15K vial strengths during the treatment phase. 
Recommended starting dosing regimens include the following: 
 A prophylactic regimen at a starting dose of 50 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc given every 3 to 
5 days.  Further dose and interval adjustments will be based on individual clinical 
response per Investigator's discretion.  Dosing may be adjusted in the range of 25 to 
65 IU/kg at 3 to 5 day intervals.  
 A prophylactic regimen of 65 IU/kg administered every 7 days may be considered for 
appropriate subjects who will be selected based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].   
Subjects will be allowed to switch from one regimen to another if approved by [CONTACT_471604].   
Study procedures to be carried out during the Treatment Period are summarized in Section 4.2.3.  
Information on study treatment (injection date, time, dose, and whether the injection was for 
prophylaxis or a bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) will be recorded in the subject’s study diary.  The 
subject/subject’s caregiver should enter study diary information in a timely manner to facilitate 
appropriate medical review and dosing guidance.

 After 13 weeks in the treatment period, subjects will undergo washout in preparation for the PK3 
assessment using 15K rFVIIIFc in either 1000 IU or 6000 IU vials (see Section 10.1.1).  
F
ollowing the PK3 assessment, subjects will resume to treatment in the Treatment Period until 
they complete a total of at least [ADDRESS_604523]’s participation in the study 
may be extended due to the treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471574]. 
After study completion, in countries where rFVIIIFc is not commercially available, eligible 
subjects will be offered enrollment into a long-term safety and efficacy extension study 
(8HA01EXT).  All subjects will have a follow-up telephone call 7 (+7) days after the last dose of 
rFVIIIFc during the Treatment Period, unless they have entered directly into Study 8HA01EXT 
by [CONTACT_14713].     
Refer to the Directions for Handling and Administration (DHA) for additional instructions. 
10.1.3. Bleeding Epi[INVESTIGATOR_72801] a subject has a bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1863], the Investigator should be notified.  The

Adapted from [WFH 2012 ]. 
Subsequent dosage and duration of treatment depends on the individual clinical response, the severity of the factor 
VIII deficiency, and the location and extent of bleeding. 
10.1.4. Surgery 
For subjects who require emergent or elective surgery during the study period, the dose and 
regimen of rFVIIIFc will be that deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_471605], following the guidance in Table 3.  
Protocol 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604524] will be withdrawn 
from the study.   
In addition, subjects who require major surgery may receive rFVIIIFc if: 
1. The surgery occurs within the contracted institution for the trial and/or a separate 
agreement has been executed, permitting the use of study drug and Biogen’s rights to 
data generated in the trial at an alternative institution deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_9532],  AND 
2. The Investigator and/or appropriate qualified/licensed delegate is available to: 
a. Administer all rFVIIIFc doses required during surgery and during postoperative 
rehabilitation (if applicable).   
b. Provide medical oversight and guidance throughout the duration of the 
preoperative and intraoperative periods.   
Surgeries, elective or emergent, will be classified as major or minor, as follows: 
 Major surgery is defined as any surgical procedure (elective or emergent) that usually, 
but not always, involves general anesthesia and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_72789], in which a 
major body cavity is penetrated and exposed, or a substantial impairment of physical or

 Minor surgery is defined as any surgical procedure (elective or emergent) that does not 
involve general anesthesia and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_72789] (e.g., minor dental extractions, 
incision, and drainage of abscess, joint or other injections, or simple excisions).   
All major surgeries will be reported as SAEs.   
Study procedures to be carried out before, during, and after surgery are summarized in 
Section 4.2.4.  Inhibitor testing should be performed [ADDRESS_604525] postoperative 
visit (for minor surgery, testing is not performed at the last 2 timepoints).  On the day of surgery, 
subjects will be given a preoperative loading dose of rFVIIIFc as a bolus, and, in the case of 
emergency surgery, as soon as possible prior to the procedure.  Predose FVIII activity levels will 
be sampled followed by [CONTACT_72862] (recovery) samples 30 ± [ADDRESS_604526]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], FVIII activity will be measured daily at the local laboratory, and a

 plasma aliquot will be prepared for each blood sample drawn so that subsequent analysis at the 
central laboratory can be performed. 
Doses higher than 65 IU/kg may be used in the context of surgery to achieve the required FVIII 
levels to prevent bleeding.  However, the maximum number of daily or every-other-day doses 
will not exceed the predicted accumulated C max of approximately 200% of normal (normal 
ranges are 50% to 150% FVIII activity).  All surgical dosing plans will be discussed with and 
approved by [CONTACT_72863].  All doses administered in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471577] (eCRF).   
During surgery and the postoperative period, the following information will be collected: 
 number of injections and dose per injection to maintain hemostasis during the surgical 
period 
 estimated blood loss (mL) during surgery and the postoperative period 
 number of blood product units transfused during surgery 
Bleeding caused directly by [CONTACT_71373], although undesired or unexpected

 10.2. Modification of Dose and/or Treatment Schedule 
Subjects will also receive 26 weeks of treatment with 15K rFVIIIFc starting after PK2.  Two 
regimens are recommended based on existing data collected during the clinical development 
program (Section 10.1.2) but will be chosen and subsequently adjusted based on the subject’s 
response, and at the Investigator’s discretion.   
Information on all of the potential modifications to the dose and treatment schedule can be found 
in Section 10.1. 
10.3. Precautions 
The first dose of rFVIIIFc will be given in the clinic.  Subjects will be provided with specific 
guidance by [CONTACT_471606] a lack of efficacy or AEs at home, 
including how to seek emergency medical treatment.   
For details regarding the risks and benefits of rFVIIIFc, see the rFVIIIFc Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
10.4. Compliance 
Compliance with treatment dosing is to be monitored and recorded by [CONTACT_6624]. 
Injections for PK assessments will be administered in the clinic under controlled conditions by 
[CONTACT_471607].   
During the treatment period, subjects or their caregivers will record treatment in a dosing diary 
that will be reviewed periodically by [CONTACT_471608].  The subject or the 
subject’s caregiver will record both routine doses and doses for the treatment of bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_471578].  Diary data will be reviewed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_6624]. 
10.5. Concomitant Therapy and Procedures 
The use of concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471579] 10.5.[ADDRESS_604529]’s eCRF, according to 
instructions for eCRF completion.  AEs related to administration of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471580]. 
10.5.1. Concomitant Therapy 
A concomitant therapy is any drug or substance administered between [ADDRESS_604530]’s welfare may be given at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  All such therapy must be recorded in the eCRF.   
Disallowed Concomitant Therapy 
No other drug under investigation may be used concomitantly with the study treatment.  Subjects 
are not allowed to participate concurrently in another clinical study. 
The following concomitant medications are not permitted during the study: 
 ASA, except for low-dose ASA, defined as a dose of ≤81 mg, as prophylaxis. 
 Current systemic treatment with chemotherapy and/or other immunosuppressant 
drugs, with the following exceptions:  medications to treat hepatitis and/or HIV, 
treatment with systemic steroids and/or inhaled steroids (with approval of the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor) and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than high-dose 
ASA, and routine immunizations. 
 Any other FVIII product (see the exceptions listed in Section  12). 
10.5.2. Concomitant Procedures 
A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) 
or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed between 
the time the subject is enrolled in the study and  the follow-up  telephone call 7 (+7) days after the 
last dose of rFVIIIFc during the Treatment Period. 
10.6. Continuation of Treatment  
Subjects who complete this study in countries where rFVIIIFc is not commercially available will 
be offered enrollment into extension study 8HA01EXT if they meet all of the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  All subjects will have a follow-up telephone call 7  (+7) days after the last 
dose of rFVIIIFc during the Treatment Period unless they have entered directly into Study 
8HA01EXT by [CONTACT_14713].     
 
 
Protocol 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604531] records in a timely manner.   
Study site staff should follow the DHA for specific instructions on the handling, preparation, 
administration, and disposal of the study treatment.  The DHA supersedes all other references 
(e.g., protocol, Investigator’s Brochure ). 
Study treatment must be stored in a secure location.  Accountability for study treatment is the 
responsibility of the Investigator.  More details concerning this responsibility are included in 
Section 11.1.4.  Dose and dosing regimen of study treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_471609].   
Study treatment must be dispensed only by a pharmacist, appropriately qualified staff, or 
designe
e.  Study treatment is to be dispensed only to subjects enrolled in this study or their legal 
guardia
n.  Once study treatment is prepared for a subject, it can be administered only to that 
subjec
t.  Study treatment vials are for one-time use only; any study treatment remaining in the 
vial should not be used for another subject. 
Subjects wi
ll receive supplies of rFVIIIFc from the study site for home administration, either at 
study site visits for PK assessments, or between study visits.  Between study visits, the subject or 
the subject’s caregiver must return to the study site for dispensation of rFVIIIFc and 
administ
ration supplies before the earliest expi[INVESTIGATOR_471581]’s inventory.  
This is to maintain adequate drug supplies for his treatment, including an adequate supply to treat 
breakthrough bleeding or due to delays scheduling clinic visits.  Each time, the study site staff

giver. 
11.1. rFVIIIFc 
rFVIIIFc is supplied in a kit that contains several components, including, but not limited to, 
lyophilized drug, a diluent, a vial adapter, and an infusion set (see DHA for further details).  The 
lyophilized 2K product is provided in 1 strength in a 10 mL clear glass vial containing 
1000 IU/vial of rFVIIIFc. The lyophilized 15K product is provided in 5 different strengths in a 
10-mL clear glass vial containing 250, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 6000 IU/vial of rFVIIIFc.  In 
additio
n to the rFVIIIFc, the formulation of the lyophilized product contains  L-Histidine, 
 sodium chloride, 
 calcium chloride dihydrate,  (w/v) sucrose, and  (w/v) 
polysorbate 20, and is the same for all [ADDRESS_604532]’s dosing regimen.  This will be documented according to the 
requirements in Section 11.1.4. 
If the packaging is damaged, or if there is anything unusual about the appearance or attributes of 
the vials of rFVIIIFc or syringes containing the diluent, the study treatment should not be used.  
The vial or syringe in question should be returned to and saved at the study site, and the problem 
immediately reported to the Sponsor. 
11.1.2. rFVIIIFc Storage 
At the study site, study treatment must be stored in a secure location.  The rFVIIIFc kit is to be 
stored at 2ºC to 8ºC in a monitored, locked refrigerator with limited access, or the room in which 
the refrigerator resides must be locked.  The Information for Patients will describe proper storage 
conditions for the study drug that subjects take home with them. 
For the most up- to-date storage requirements, follow the instructions provided in the DHA. 
11.1.3. rFVIIIFc Handling and Disposal 
The Investigator must return all used and unused kits of rFVIIIFc as instructed by [CONTACT_1034].  
The instructions for return will be provided at the time the request is made by [CONTACT_471610] (or its 
designee). 
If the Sponsor requests the study site to destroy unused rFVIIIFc kits, the 
institution/Investigator(s) must notify the Sponsor, in writing, of the method of destruction, the 
date of destruction, and the location of destruction. 
Protocol 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604533] 
maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and amount of study treatment received, to whom 
dispensed (subject by [CONTACT_324340]), amount returned by [CONTACT_423], and accounts of any 
study treatment accidentally or deliberately destroyed.  These records will be routinely reviewed 
by [CONTACT_71382]. 
Unless otherwise notified, all vials (used and unused) must be saved for study treatment 
accountability.  The subject/caregiver should return all vials (used and unused) at each clinic 
visit for full medication exchange and accountability.  At the end of the study, reconciliation 
must be made between the amount of drug product supplied, dispensed, and subsequently 
destroyed or returned to the Sponsor.  A written explanation must be provided by [CONTACT_471611]. 
The IXRS system will be used to randomize subjects to Group 1 (15K rFVIIIFc, 1000 IU/vial) or 
Group 2 (15K rFVIIIFc, 6000 IU/vial) for PK2 and PK3.  For these PK assessments, the IXRS 
will direct the site to dispense a specific dosing kit number that is appropriate to that particular 
subject’s PK dosing group. Therefore, it is critical that the study site follow the instructions of 
the IXRS system in dispensing kits for the PK assessments.

inhibitor, or has an anaphylactic reaction to the study treatment, or if additional tests for 
assessment of coagulation parameters or safety parameters are required.  A blood sample will 
also be collected at study start to be used for any additional immunologic/serologic testing as 
needed. 
In addition to this, samples will be retained until after completion of review by [CONTACT_471612] [EMA (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) 2011 ] in the case of a 
positive inhibitor or clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_471582]. 
No samples will be used for genetic analyses except FVIII genotype retesting in case of detection 
of inhibitors. 
The total blood sample volume will not exceed [ADDRESS_604543] or his legally authorized representative and/or main 
caregiver must be given the names and telephone numbers of study site staff for reporting AEs

15.1. Definitions 
15.1.1. Serious Pretreatment Event 
A serious pretreatment event is any event that meets the criteria for SAE reporting (as defined in 
Section 15.1.3) and occurs after the subject signs the ICF, but before administration of study 
treatment. 
15.1.2. Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. 
Bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471583].  Bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471584] a serious criterion (Section 15.1.3) should be reported as an SAE.  All bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_471585].   
15.1.3. Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death 
 In the view of the Investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of death (a 
life-threatening event); however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471586] 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604544]

Biogen MA Inc. 
63 
  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
All major surgeries will be reported as SAEs.  An SAE may also be any other medically 
important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
(Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) 
15.2. Safety Classifications 
15.2.1. Investigator Assessment of Events 
All events must be assessed to determine the following: 
 If the event meets the criteria for an SAE as defined in Section 15.1.3. 
 The relationship of the event to study treatment as defined in Section 15.2.2 . 
 The severity of the event as defined in Section 15.2.3. 
15.2.2. Relationship of Events to Study Treatment 
The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs and 
SAEs to the study treatment. 
Relationship of Event to Study Treatment  
Not related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the investigational drug if there is 
not a reasonable possibility that the event has been caus ed by [CONTACT_56695].  Factors pointing toward this assessment include but are not limited to:  the 
lack of reasonable temporal relationship between administration of the drug and the 
event, the presence of a biologically implausible relat ionship between the product and the 
AE, or the presence of a more likely alternative explanation for the AE.  
Related An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the investigational drug if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have bee n caused by [CONTACT_56695].  Factors that point toward this assessment include but are not limited to:  a 
positive rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug 
and the event, a known response pattern of th e suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the drug 
and the AE, or a lack of an alternative explanation for the AE.  
15.2.3. Severity of Events 
The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the severity of AEs and SAEs:

 Severity of Event  
Mild Symptom(s) barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject uncomfortable; does 
not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for 
relief of symptom(s) but may be given because of personality of subject.  
Moderate  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance of daily 
activity is influenced; subject is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom(s) may 
be needed. 
Severe Symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant 
impact on subject’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with study 
treatment; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18552] d. 
15.2.4. Expectedness of Events 
Expectedness of all AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_204903] (or designee) according to the 
Investigator’s Brochure for rFVIIIFc.   
15.3. Monitoring and Recording Events 
15.3.1. Serious Pretreatment Events 
A serious pretreatment event experienced by [CONTACT_471613], but 
before administration of study treatment, is to be recorded on the SAE form and faxed to 
Quintiles Pharmacovigilance (PVG) within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of 
the event (see Section 15.3.5). 
15.3.2. Adverse Events 
Any AE experienced by [CONTACT_471614], rFVIIIFc, 
and the final follow-up telephone call (7 [+ 7] days after last dose of rFVIIIFc) is to be recorded 
on the eCRF, regardless of the severity of the event or its relationship to study treatment. 
In addition, any known, untoward event that occurs subsequent to the AE reporting period that 
the Investigator assesses as possibly related to the investigational medication/product should also 
be reported as an AE. 
15.3.3. Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE experienced by [CONTACT_471615]-up call is to be recorded on the eCRF and SAE form, regardless of the severity 
of the event or its relationship to study treatment.  SAEs must be collected for up to [ADDRESS_604546]’s last dose of rFVIIIFc must also be recorded on the SAE form.  SAEs must be 
reported to the designated personnel as detailed in the study file. 
Any SAE that is ongoing when the subject completes or discontinues the study will be followed 
by [CONTACT_71390], stabilized, or returned to baseline status. 
In this study, the following events are considered medically important and must be reported as 
SAEs: 
 A subject develops an inhibitor, as defined in Section 7.2.1. 
 A Grade 2 or greater allergic drug reaction in association with administration of 
rFVIIIFc, as defined below by [CONTACT_72873]-
Acute Toxic Effects on the WHO scale [WHO 1979 ]:  
o Grade 2 Bronchospasm related to rFVIIIFc; no parenteral therapy needed 
o Grade 3 Bronchospasm related to rFVIIIFc; parenteral therapy required 
o Grade 4 Anaphylaxis related to rFVIIIFc 
 A subject develops a vascular thrombotic event in association with the administration 
of rFVIIIFc, with the exception of IV injection site thrombophlebitis.   
 Major surgery. 
Subjects will be informed of early symptoms and signs of thrombotic phenomena, including pain 
and/or tenderness along a vein, swelling of an arm or leg without pain or tenderness, redness 
along a vein, low fever without any known reason (such as a cold or flu), sudden shortness of 
breath or difficulty breathing or coughing, sudden chest pain, sudden severe headache or changes 
in vision, and numbness or tingling in arms or legs.  If such an event occurs while the subject is 
at home, the subject will be instructed to seek immediate medical care. 
15.3.4. All Events  
All events must be assessed to determine the following: 
 If the event meets the criteria for an SAE as defined in Section 15.3.3. 
 The relationship of the event to study treatment as defined in Section 15.2.2. 
 The severity of the event as defined in Section 15.2.3. 
Protocol 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604547] 
formally notify Quintiles PVG within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE.  At the same time, the event should be recorded in the eCRF.  It is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that the SAE reporting information and procedures are used and followed 
appropriately. 
Reporting Information for SAEs  
Any SAE that occurs between the time that the subject has signed the ICF and [ADDRESS_604548] be reported to Biogen SABR (or designee ) within [ADDRESS_604549] be submitted  to Biogen SABR (or designee ) regardless of the following:  
 Whether or not the subject has undergone study -related procedures  
 Whether or not the subject has received study treatment  
 The severity of the event  
 The relationship of the event to study treatment  
To report initial or follow -up information on a n SAE, fax a complete d SAE form to Quintiles 
PVG at the country specific fax number provided in the Study Reference Guide . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Deaths 
Death is an outcome of an event.  The event that resulted in death should be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.  All causes of death must be reported as SAEs within 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of the event.  The Investigator should make every effort to obtain and send 
death certificates and autopsy reports to Biogen SABR.  The term death should be reported as an 
SAE only if the cause of death is not known and cannot be determined. 
15.3.6. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAEs that are unexpected and 
judged by [CONTACT_426600].  Biogen

 15.4. Procedures for Handling Special Situations 
15.4.1. Pregnancy 
The population under study is male; therefore, pregnancies will not be tracked.   
Congenital abnormalities/birth defects in the offspring of male subjects should be reported if 
study drug-exposed conception occurs.   
15.4.2. Overdose 
An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a subject or taken by a subject that exceeds 
100 IU/kg.  Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the 
eCRF; however, all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and faxed to Biogen 
SABR (or designee ) within [ADDRESS_604551] be reported to Biogen SABR (or designee ) eve n if the overdose does not result in an AE.  If 
an overdose results in an AE, the AE must be recorded.  If an overdose results in an SAE, both 
the SAE and Overdose forms must be completed and faxed to Biogen SABR (or designee).  All 
study treatment-related dosing information must be recorded on the dosing eCRF. 
15.4.3. Medical Emergency

 16. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SI ZE 
The objectives of the study and the endpoints to be analyzed are listed in Section 6. 
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will 
be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan. 
16.1. Demography and Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The analysis of demography and baseline disease characteristics will be based on the Safety 
Analysis Set.  A description of the Safety Analysis Set is provided in Section 16.3.1.  
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics will be summarized categorically and with 
descriptive statistics, as appropriate, for each treatment sequence group and overall. 
Demographic data to be tabulated will include age, race, hemophilia history, genotype, and other 
disease-specific measures.  
Baseline disease characteristics, based on general medical and surgical and hemophilia histories, 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_229380], as follows: general medical and surgical history will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_72877] a medical history in each of the 
major body system classifications; hemophilia history data to be tabulated will include genotype 
and other disease- and treatment-specific measures.

  15K rFVIIIFc at the 15K baseline (i.e., at PK2) and after 13 weeks of treatment (at 
PK3) 
 15K rFVIIIFc at 1000 IU/vial and 6000 IU/vial 
 2K rFVIIIFc (at PK1) and 15K rFVIIIFc (at PK2) [except AUC inf and IR, which are 
included in the primary endpoint] 
16.2.1. Analysis Populations 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS) 
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS) is defined as all subjects with evaluable PK profiles. 
A PK profile for a given injection is considered evaluable if all PK parameters can be determined 
in at least 1  of the 2 assays. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sequential Pharmacokinetic Subgroup 
The Sequential Pharmacokinetic Subgroup will consist of all subjects who have evaluable PK 
profiles for PK2 and for at least 1  ofPK1 and PK3. 
16.2.2. Methods of Analysis 
Natural log transformed primary PK endpoints (AUC inf [if data permit] and IR following 
rFVIIIFc dosing for 2K and for 15K at the 15K baseline measured by [CONTACT_71346]-stage [aPTT] 
assay) will be analyzed using a mixed effects model with period and treatment as fixed effects 
and subject as a random effect.  Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (15K-2K) and 
corresponding 90% CIs will be obtained from the model.  The adjusted mean differences and 
90% CIs for the differences will be back transformed (exponentiated) to provide estimates of the 
ratio of adjusted geometric means (15K/2K) and 90% CIs for the ratios.   
For descriptive purposes only, similar analyses may be performed for secondary PK parameters 
measured by [CONTACT_71346]-stage (aPTT) assay and for all relevant PK parameters measured by [CONTACT_471616]-stage chromogenic assay.  
Comparability of the 2  manufacturing scales will be concluded if the 90% CIs for the ratio of 
adjusted geometric means for both primary PK endpoints (AUC inf  and IR following rFVIIIFc 
dosing for 2K and for 15K at the 15K baseline measured by [CONTACT_71346]-stage [aPTT] assay) fall 
within the range of (68%, 146%). 
The FVIII activity data will be tabulated over time for each subject and summarized by [CONTACT_99722] (2K 
[PK1], 15K [PK2] or 15K [PK3]) and vial strength (1000 IU/vial, 6000 IU/vial or overall) using 
descriptive statistics.  Mean FVIII activity will be plotted over time for each scale (with 
combined vial strengths) and each available combination of scale and vial strength. 
Protocol 997HA309 Version [ADDRESS_604555], and summary statistics for the PK 
endpoints (including AUC inf, IR, C max, t1/2, CL, V ss, and MRT) will be summarized descriptive ly 
by [CONTACT_206343] (2K [PK1], 15K [PK2] or 15K [PK3]), vial strength (1000 IU/vial, 
6000 IU/vial, or overa ll), and by [CONTACT_135942] (one-stage [aPTT] clotting assay and two-stage 
chromogenic assay).  Summary statistics for AUC inf and IR measured by [CONTACT_71346]-stage (aPTT) 
clotting assay and the two-stage chromogenic assay will include but not be limited to the mean, 
CI, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values, as well as the geometric means 
(antilog of the means of the logs) and coefficients of variation.  Similar analyses will be 
performed for the other secondary PK parameters measured by [CONTACT_71346]-stage (aPTT) assay and 
for all relevant PK parameters measured by [CONTACT_112913]-stage chromogenic assay.  Arithmetic mean 
activity by [CONTACT_471617] (with combined vial 
strengths) and each available combination of scale and vial strength.

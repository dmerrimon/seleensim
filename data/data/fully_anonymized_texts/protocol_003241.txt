Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_949123] is indicated to determine if the anisocoria is due to 
either Adie’s tonic pupil or pharmacological dilation versus third cranial nerve palsy. If 
the pupil constricts to low -dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], the patient is determined to have Adie’s 
tonic pupil, or parasympathetic denervation. However, if the pupil does not cons trict with 
low-dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], a high- dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_699063] -up. If the 
pupil constricts to high- dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], the patient is determined to have a third cranial 
nerve palsy which then needs to be further evaluated with ima ging including CT 
angiogram due to concern for aneurysm rupture. However, if the pupil does not constrict 
to high- dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], the patient likely has anisocoria due to pharmacological 
dilation. Suspected iatrogenic anisocoria does not require further evaluation with 
imaging as it should resolve as the pharmacological substance causing the dilation is 
metabolized. The flow chart in the BCSC  books does not consider a phenomenon that 
may occur as the pharmacological substance causing dilation wears off. W e propose 
that there is a period of time in which a pharmacologically dilated pupil may constrict to 
high- dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], but still appear dilated, and thus anisocoric. In this case, the 
patient would require additional imaging with CT angiogram, even th ough their history 
may not support any findings concerning for third nerve palsy due to aneurysm. 
Depending on the patient’s history, conducting further imaging may have greater risks 
and financial burden that are unlikely to provide valuable information. If a patient has 
history of possible pharmacological dilation in absence of aneurysm symptoms including headache, nausea, vision changes, loss of consciousness, then the patient should not be further evaluated with imaging. We aim to demonstrate the period in which a 
pharmacologically dilated eye may appear anisocoric on exam, but still respond to 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227].  
  
B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
                      
Proper workup of anisocoria that is greater in bright light is extremely important 
given the potentially dangerous causes of an inappropriately dilated pupil. Particularly, 
the reaction of the anatomically intact, inappropriately dilated pupil to 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_699064] a t hird 
nerve palsy. Although third nerve palsies are often associated with ophthalmoplegia in addition to mydriasis, isolated mydriasis of the affected pupil can be seen in the early 
stages of compressive damage to the nerve.
[ADDRESS_949124], yet inappropriately 
dilated eye that contracts to 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], but not to 0.1%, will be considered 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_271] a third nerve palsy. Our proposal to clarify the “wearing- off” period of 
pharmacologic dilation will provide those utilizing this algorithm with an alternative 
etiology for a pupil that constricts to 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]. This addition will help to avoid 
unnecessary and expensive workup for a suspected third cranial nerve palsy.  
Curre ntly, there is not any literature that describes the “wearing- off” period of 
pharmacological dilation as a cause of anisocoria in respect to acute clinical workup. 
Although there are examples of recent studies describing the potential use of 
constricting agents to reverse pharmacologically induced mydriasis, these studies have been limited in scope to symptomatic relief from the dilated eye and thus have not influenced the BCSC algorithm for the treatment of anisocoria in the acute setting.

D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
 
Recruitment of participants for this study will be done at the University of South 
Carolina School of Medicine Greenville. We will be recruiting [ADDRESS_949126] 
informationappx .3 and exclusion/inclusion criteria form sappx.4. They  will then be screened 
for hyperopia using a phoropter , have their intraocular pressures measured using a 
Reichert Tono- Pen Avia , and have their iridocorneal angle measured with a gonio lens . 
The purpose of this exam is to screen out participants with  hyperopia >  +1 diopter,  
iridocorneal angles  where trabecular meshwork cannot be seen for greater than half of 
the angle , and/or intraocular pressures  of > 22 mm Hg, as these conditions  may 
increase the risk for mydriatic agent -induced angle closure glaucomaappx.4. An additional 
ophthalmic medication, proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%, will be used to numb the eyes 
before measuring intraocular pressures and prior to gonio lens examination. This 
medication is commonly used as an ocular surface analgesic during routine eye 
examinations. This screening exam will take place at least  one day prior to 
administration  of any dilating drops, as examination of the angle with gonio  lens may 
affect pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699065] . The initial exam will be performed by a  
physician licensed to practice ophthalmology.  
After screening, participants will be asked to return to the clinic  on a scheduled 
day (within a week of screening)  to have their left eye dilated.   At this visit, the diameter 
of their left  pupil will be measured using a Near card in a windowless room with a set 
light-level. Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_699066]. 
Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_699067] a suspected effect time of 4- [ADDRESS_949127], about 20-
30 minutes, the diameter of the participant's  pupil will be measured again.  After 
measurement of baseline pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699068] , participants will be 
dismissed and  asked to return to the clinic in 3- [ADDRESS_949128] the 
diameter of the left pupil again and compare it to the participant's baseline as well as post-dilation diameter. One drop of 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_699069]'s left eye.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] 1% is a miotic agent that is the current standard for 
workup of anisocoria of unknown cause acc ording to the 2021- [ADDRESS_949129],  
any change in pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699070]. Following this measurement, 
participants will be dismissed. A positive result will be indicated by a constricting 
response of the pupil after administration of pi[INVESTIGATOR_699071] > 1mm in diameter, while still 
appearing anisocoric on exam (clinically significant difference in pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699072]). Application of dilating and constricting eye drops, as well 
as measurement of pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699073]. These volunteers will receiv e training on sterile  eye-drop application technique as well 
as pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699074] a Near card.  
In the event that no response to 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_699075] -
dilation visit, or if pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699076] 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_699077], we will ask this par ticipant to return to the clinic on 
another day to have the process repeated in their right eye, with the modification  of 
either shortening or lengthening the interval of reassessment  based on their left eye’s 
response to the drops . This is to  avoid any co nfounding from the administration of 
subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_699078].  If the left pupil  return ed to baseline 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699079] 3- [ADDRESS_949130] their  pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699080] 1% repeated . If the left pupil remained dilated with no  
response to 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_699081] 3- [ADDRESS_949131] their pupi[INVESTIGATOR_699082] 1% repeated . Repeating the protocol with varied assessment times  in the 
contralateral eye will be in an effort  to compensate for expected variation in each 
participant’s response to tropi[INVESTIGATOR_143582] 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], it is possible that 
we will not be able to capture thi s critical window in each participant, if one exists. 
However, we do not believe it will be necessary to demonstrate the phenomenon in all participants, and a minimum of 2 positive results  should be sufficient to demonstrate our 
proposed concept for this preliminary study.   
 
E. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
1.  TARGET POPULATION: 
 
We plan to conduct the study with 15 medical student volunteers at the University 
of South Carolina Greenville. Exclusion criteria  include  a history of  angle closure 
glaucoma, any other type of glaucoma, or any elevated eye pressure readings as well as any history of intraocular surgery  or procedure.  Exclusion will also occur if the 
participant is found to be hyperopic to >+1 diopter , has an intraocular pressure of > [ADDRESS_949132] > 1mm to 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]. We feel that at least  [ADDRESS_949133] both of their eyes independently  with varying 
timeframes of reassessment . If we limited the study to < [ADDRESS_949134] without  subjecting participants to multiple rounds of testing.  
If we are able to describe a period in which the pharmacologically dilated pupil 
responds to 1% pi[INVESTIGATOR_699083] >1mm of constriction but  maintains the appearance of 
anisocoria that is worse in bright light  in two or more participants , this study will serve as 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_699084].        
2.  RECRUITMENT PLANS : 
 Recruitment of subjects will be done in person at the University of South Carolina 
School of Medicine Greenville, via the school newsletter that is sent to the student body 
on a weekly basis, and with email correspondence via the Ophthalmology interest group 
at the school.  Approval has been obtained from school administration to conduct 
recruitment onsite and via electronic correspondence

3. EXISTING DATA/SAMPLES:  
 
     There are not any exist ing data or samples for this  study.  
  
4.  CONSENT/ASSENT:  
 
The participants will be asked to sign a consent form prior to participationappx. 5.  
The study doctor will consent the participants before any study procedures are 
completed. All communication will take place in a private setting.  The participant will be 
given ample time to read the consent and have all questions answered prior to providi ng 
signature.   The consent will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_605739] a copy will be 
provided to the participants at the time of consent.  The consent will discuss risks of eye 
dilation including blurred vision for several hours following drop administrati on. 
Participants will also be informed of the risk of angle- closure glaucoma, and will be 
screened for any significant ophthalmological history, which will exclude them from the study. Participants will have ample opportunity to ask any questions concernin g what to 
expect from and potential risks of dilating drops.  
 
5.  POTENTIAL RISKS: 
 
Drug Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] : 
The risks of the study are largely limited to side effects from the dilating drops, which 
are mild  (increased heart rate,  headache, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, allergic 
reactions, tense muscles, stinging of eyes (transient), eye surface injury)  other than the 
rare, but serious, risk of inducing angle closure glaucoma.   Participants will be 
instructed to monitor symptoms of angle closure glaucoma including headache, nausea, 
and eye pain, and participants with history of angle closure or any other type of glaucoma will be excluded from the study.   
Drug Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] :  
 
A possible side effect is retinal detachment, an emergency situation in which a thin layer 
of tissue (the retina) at the back of the eye pulls away from its normal position. This side effect is serious but extremely rare. Other side effects, which are less severe, but may 
occur more frequently include: brow ache , headache, blurred vision, eye irritation, eye 
pain, watery eyes  and visual impairment (including dim, dark, or jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_213720]).  
 
Drug Proparacaine Hydrochloride:  
 Occasional temporary stinging, burning and conjunctival redness may occur with the 
use of proparacaine. A rare, severe, immediate- type, apparently hyperallergic corneal 
reaction characterized by [CONTACT_9420], intense and diffuse epi[INVESTIGATOR_242068], a gray, ground 
glass appearance, sloughing of large areas of necrotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], corneal filaments and  
Sometimes iritis with descemetitis has also been reported.  
 Therefore, the small likelihood of risks outweighs the benefit of improving understanding of the time parameters of the pharmacological effects of dilation drops.  The participants 
will likely experience blurred vision, particularly near vision, for up to eight hours after 
administration of dilating drops. The participants will be asked to use dark sunglasses  
when in bright sunlight or when driving for at least twelve hours.  
For precautionary measures, participants will be asked to contact [CONTACT_699085][INVESTIGATOR_31424], or if they 
experience any symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma or retinal detachment.  If 
angle- closure glaucoma or retinal detachment are suspected, we plan to adhere to 
standardized protocol for treatment.  
 
Devices:  
There is a small risk of corneal abrasion with handheld  applanation tonometry and 
gonioscopy, as in both cases direct contact [CONTACT_699086]. This is extremely 
rare, and we are mitigating this risk by [CONTACT_7661] a trained physician ([CONTACT_699087]) perform these exams. These are both examination techniques used in the eye office daily.  
 
The Reichert Tono- Pen Avia uses tips that contain natural rubber latex  which may 
cause allergic reactions . Participants will be screened for a known allergy to natural 
rubber latex and  will be asked  to monitor for signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction 
following use of the Tono- Pen.
 
 
6.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS:  
 
This research study is not expected to directly benefit individual subjects but is 
likely to yield generalizable knowledge which contributes  to the field.  The information 
gained from this study may be useful and may help others who will be undergoing 
evaluations for anisocoria in the future.    
  
7.  CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
Information obtained about participants during this research may be published, 
but they will not be identified. Information that is obtained concerning this research that 
can be identified will remain confidential to the extent possible within State and Federal 
law. The investigators associated with this study, the sponsor, and the Institutional Review Board will have access to identifying information. All records in South Carolina 
are subject to subpoena by a court of law. Study information will be securely stored in 
locked files and on password- protected network storage .   
 
8. COMPENSATION:  
 
We plan to provide participants with a gift card (Clincard)  for their time spent 
conducting the study. We plan to request $[ADDRESS_949135] their grades, evaluations or medical school standings.   
 
9.  WITHDRAWAL:  
 
Participants may withdraw at any point, but the gift card will not be given as 
compensation unless participants complete the entire study.  If participants fail to meet 
all inclusion criteria or meet any exclusion criteria during their initial visit and screening exam, they will not be able to proceed with the experiment a nd therefore will not receive 
compensation.

Statistical Considerations  
 In this se ction, we outline in detail the strengths of our proposed sampling an d analysis plan 
and how it is designed to address and minimize the potential limitations of our study design.  
Specifically, we elaborate on how we plan to make our samples in the peer -support and 
standard community services group comparable, despi[INVESTIGATOR_222707] ; how we will control for differences  across sites in our analyses ; and how we will 
deal with missing data (including loss to follow -up). 
  
Analysi s Plan The mixed experimental  and quasi -experimental, matched group comparison 
design allows us to conduct three different analyses to accomplish both Aims 1 and 2: (1) 
comparing the effectiveness of peer support to standard community services at 6 months 
comb ining data from all three sites; (2) analyzing the data from AJFCS and the combined data 
from the other two sites to assess the internal consi stency of the effectiveness across the 
randomized and non -randomized designs but also to assess whether the effect size is different 
between the two components of the study design; (3) analyzing data from AJFCS to test 
whether peer -support is more effectiv e when provided for [ADDRESS_267760] analysis  using AJFCS data only,  we will compare 12 vs. 6 month “dose” -levels of the 
peer-to-peer support intervention changes in the rates of health care utilization and nursing 
home placeme nt and self -rated health, wellness, depression, and anxiety of between baseline 
and [ADDRESS_267761] community services;  
as reminder this group received standard services for 6 months and then transitioned into  
receiving peer -support  between 6 and 12 months (see Figure 3).    
     The primary analyses for comparative effectiveness will be based  on two -sample 
independent tests such as t -test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher’s exact test or chi -square test 
of the outcome measures. The choice of analytic method will depend on whether the outcome 
measures are continuous or categorical.  These tests w ill be performed at a two -tailed 
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_267762] subgroup analyses based on 
race/ethnicity (African American, Hispanic and non -Hispanic  White), gender (male vs. female), 
age group (< 70, 70 -80 and ≥ 80 years), and language (English - vs. Spanish -speaking) and by 
[CONTACT_123085].  These subgroup analyses will be conducted to evaluate the internal consistency 
of intervention effect, and subgr oup by [CONTACT_222708].  
 
Randomization and matching  In order to reduce potential bias further, participants from the 
AJFCS of Palm Beach will be allocated either to peer -to-peer support (Intervention) or standard 
community support (Control) in a 1:1 ratio using permuted block randomization, stratified by 
[CONTACT_654], gender and race/ethnicity. Barring randomization in JFS of LA and Community Place of 
Greater [COMPANY_002]ster, older adults already partic ipating in peer -to-peer support and those on the 
waiting list will be matched on age, gender and race/ethnicity to mitigate potential differences 
between the two groups.  In order to avoid reporting/ascertainment bias, calls will be made to all 
participati ng older adults and support staff at 3 and 9 months as outlined in Figure 4 above.  
 
Sample Si ze Justification Given the total sample size of 720 at -risk older adults, the study has 
0.80/0.85/0.[ADDRESS_267763] size of 0.209/0.223/0.[ADDRESS_267764] sizes.

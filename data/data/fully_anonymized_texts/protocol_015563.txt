1.0 INTRODUCTION  
This registry is a retrospective, observational, non-controlled chart review conducted to support an 
indication expansion of the Tendril STS 2088 lead to include pacing/sensing in the left bundle branch 
area.  
This clinical investigation will be conducted in accordance with this CIP. All investigators involved in the conduct of the clinical investigation will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, or experience to perform their 
tasks and this training will be documented appropriately.  
1.1 Background and Rationale 
 Background 
Patients with cardiac disease may exhibit symptoms associated with electrical conduction abnormalities, 
such as bradycardia (sinus node dysfunction and/or heart block), thereby [CONTACT_458049] a permanent dual -chamber (atrioventricular) or single-chamber (ventricular) pacemaker.  However, these 
pacing modalities are associated with alteration of the normal electrical conduction due to right 
ventricular (RV) pacing,
1-3 leading to accelerated progression of left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, 
and increasing the risk of heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_458041].4, 5 Patients with electrical 
conduction abnormalities may also present with associated ventricular desynchrony causing further 
cardiac disease progression into heart failure with impaired left ventricular function.6 
 
Physiological pacing achieved by [CONTACT_458050] -bundle pacing (HBP) and left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) 
has emerged as an alternative pacing strategy for patients with pacemaker indications. While HBP can 
be considered an ideal form of physiological pacing as it activates the heart through the native His -
Purkinje conduction system resulting in synchronized contraction of the ventricles obviating RV pacing-related complications, its widespread clinical utility has been limited by [CONTACT_458051], acc urate His -bundle capture (selective vs. non -selective), and early battery depletion due 
to high pacing thresholds over time. Left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP), on the other hand, has 
been suggested as an effective alternative to overcome the limitatio ns of HBP attributed to the anatomic 
and histological characteristics  of the LBB .
7  
 The left bundle branch (LBB) is surrounded by [CONTACT_458052] a large target zone for 
pacing owing to its thick, band-like structure.
[ADDRESS_585045] to clinical outcome, it has been reported that LBBAP provides stable and reliable lead 
parameters at short and intermediate follow -up.8-11 The need for a back -up RV lead is deemed 
unnec essary and device programming is simplified.8, 12 Furthermore, reported complication rates of the 
1343 published cases remain low with LBBAP,13 and increased threshold at follow -up is infrequent 
thereby [CONTACT_458053].14 Improvements on clinical outcomes of LBBAP compared 
to RVP has been further demonstrated by [CONTACT_24139]. using results from the Geisinger -Rush 
Conduction System Pacing Registry with a large multicenter cohort.  It has been concluded that LBBAP was associated with a significant reduction in the composition outcome of all -cause mortality, heart 
failure or upgrade to bi -ventricular pacing.

 Rationale for Conducting this Clinical Investigation 
LBBAP has emerged as a feasible and safe alternative to traditional pacing modalities with clinical and 
electrophysiological advantages. This is a retrospective, observational, non-controlled chart review real-
world evidence registry  to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of LBBA pacing/sensing in patients 
already implanted with the Tendril STS 2088 lead. The LBBAP data collection registry  is designed to 
support future indication expansion of the existing Tendril STS 2088TC lead to include conduction 
system pacing in the left bundle branch area (LBBAP). This LBBAP data collection registry is designed in 
accordance with FDA’s guidance documents : Considerations for the Use of Real -World Data and Real -
World Evidence To Support Regulator y Decision -Making for Drug and Biological Products – December 
2021 and Considerations for the Use of Real -World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for 
Medical Devices  – August 2017. Tendril STS 2088TC bradycardia lead is currently market approv ed 
under P960013/S46 on May 26, 2009 and CE-marked under CE Cert no. 17 09 01 [ZIP_CODE] 104 on June 
16, 2009, and is indicated for permanent sensing and pacing in either the right atrium or the right 
ventricle in combination with a compatible pacemaker , implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or 
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-P/CRT -D) device.

• Sites should retain an enrollment log which links the subject ID and identifiable information for 
traceability purposes in order to address inquiries from regulatory agencies, as needed.  
• Sites should review patient medical records (i.e., electronic health records) and submit only de-
identified data through Case Report Forms  (CRFs).  
• Sites should make all the effort to collect both successful and unsuccessful LBBAP implantation 
attempts for the time being applicable to the purpose of this registry  by [CONTACT_14662] a device inventory 
list and/or sales data relevant to the usage of the TendrilTM STS 2088 lead. 
• Monitoring by [CONTACT_458054] a risk -based approach to maintain the 
reliability and data integrity of the data included in this registry  (see details in section 10.6) .  
3.3 Suspension or Early Termination of the Clinical  Investigation  
While no formal statistical rule for early termination of the clinical investigation for insufficient 
effectiveness of the device under investigation is defined, the Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the clinical investigation at any stage or reduce the follow -up period with suitable written notice to the 
investigator. Possible reason(s) may include, but are not limited to: 
• Further product development is cancelled  
• Inability to gather adequate patient data 
 Su bject Follow -up for Early Termination or Suspension of Registry  
If the Sponsor suspends or prematurely terminates the clinical investigation at an individual site in the 
interest of safety, the Sponsor will inform all other Principal Investigators. 
 If suspension or premature termination occurs, the Sponsor will remain responsible for providing resources to fulfill the obligations from the CIP and existing agreements .  
 
The investigator will be requested to return all clinical investigation materials to the Sponsor and provide 
a written statement to the IRB/EC (if applicable). All applicable clinical investigation documents shall be subject to the same retention policy as  detailed in [Section 11.5] of the CIP. 
 A Principal Investigator, IRB/EC, or regulatory authority may also suspend or prematurely terminate participation in the clinical investigation at the investigational site(s) for which they are responsible. The 
investigators will follow the requirements specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
 If a suspended investigation is to be resumed, a prior approval should be obtained from the EC/IRB (if 
applicable) and a notification should be sent to the regulatory bodies  (if applicable) .

APPENDIX VII : CIP SUMMARY 
Clinical 
Investigation 
Name [CONTACT_458061] (LBBAP) Data Collection Registry  
Objective (s) The LBBAP data collection registry will be conducted to support an indication 
expansion of the TendrilTM STS 2088 lead to include pacing/sensing in the left 
bundle branch area.    
Device  Under 
Investigation  TendrilTM STS [ADDRESS_585068] 
190 evaluable subjects in this registry . The chart review will be conducted at up 
to 20 centers worldwide. 
Clinical 
Investigation Design Retrospective, observational, non-randomized, multi -center registry  
 
• This registry  will retrospectively collect data on LBBAP implants already 
attempted in patients using the Tendril STS 2088 lead.  
• Sites should make every effort to enroll consecutive subjects with an attempted LBBAP implant  
• Sites will retain an enrollment log which links the subject ID and identifiable information for traceability purposes in order to address 
inquiries from regulatory agencies, as needed.  
• Sites will review patient medical records (i.e., electronic health records) 
and submit only de-identified data through Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
• Sites should make all the effort to collect both successful and unsuccessful LBBAP implantation attempts for the time being applicable to the purpose of this re gistry  by [CONTACT_14662] a device inventory list and/or 
sales data relevant to the usage of the Tendril
TM STS 2088 lead. 
• Data will be collected from previously occurring visits at baseline (required) , implant (required) , 6 months  (± 3 months, required), and 12 
months  (-2, +4 months, optional ). 
• Monitoring by [CONTACT_458054] a risk -based 
approach to maintain the reliability and data integrity of the data 
included in this registry . 
Waiver of 
Informed Consent Waiver of patient informed consent will be requested at each site’ s governing 
IRB/EC since this registry  involves no more than minimal risk and a requirement 
of individual informed consent would make the conduct of the research 
impracticable1  

  
Study Name: [CONTACT_458060]: [ZIP_CODE] Rev. J   Page 37 of 39  
 
• No more than minimal risk:  The only risk to patients are related to the 
safeguarding of patient information. The registry  design mitigates this 
risk by [CONTACT_458058]-identified data and reporting pooled results with no direct identification of any individual patient or study center.  
 
• Impracticable to require individual informed consent:  A requirement of informed consent could introduce sampling bias into the findings since 
the subset of patients who respond to the solicitation for this registry  and 
who provide informed consent may not be representative of the registry  
population

2.0  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
       
The efficacy of aromatase inhibitors (AI) in the treatment of postmenopausal women with 
hormone receptor positive, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is undisputed. In this regard, 
prior randomized clinical trials have documented the superiority of exemestane (EXE) 
over tamoxifen, as first line therapy [1] and the superiority of EXE over megestrol 
acetate, as second line therapy after tamoxifen failure [2]. Prior phase II studies have also 
documented the efficacy of EXE in the treatment of MBC after failure of several lines of 
prior hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [3], including prior exposure to nonsteroidal AIs [4, 5]. While 
the utility of EXE has been proven with respect to several important clinical indicators 
(e.g. response rate, time to progression, median survival time and median duration of 
response), eventually all patients will develop disease progression due to the development 
of acquired resistance to further treatment. In addition, as has recently been reported, 
some pa
tients with breast cancer may derive less than maximal benefit from AI therapy 
due to noncompliance because of musculoskeletal-related adverse effects [6, 7]. The aim 
of this research proposal, therefore, is to determine whether there may be an effective 
strategy to delay the time to development of resistance to EXE in the treatment of MBC, 
while minimizing potential toxicities and ensuring patient compliance with treatment. 
 
In order to achieve our study objectives, we propose a phase II pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 
translational trial incorporating the use of intermittent EXE therapy in the 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]    October 25, 2013 
Version: [ADDRESS_345857]. Shiuan Chen (Figure 1). As [CONTACT_186672]’s 
research interests have been in identifying mechanisms of AI resistance, he has 
generated a unique research tool, MCF-7aro, an estrogen receptor positive 
br
east cancer cell line in which aromatase is over-expressed [8,9]. Using this 
c
ell line, it was demonstrated that continuous exposure to EXE initially 
inhibited cell growth, indicative of the sensitivity of this cell line to treatment. 
With prolonged, continuous exposure to EXE, however, cells eventually 
resumed growth after 6-[ADDRESS_345858], in cells 
exposed to intermittent treatment with EXE, either on a schedule of 1 week 
on/1week off, 2 weeks on/1 week off or 3 weeks on/[ADDRESS_345859] documented, for 
example, that patients with MBC can demonstrate regression of disease in 
response to withdrawal of antiestrogen treatments [10, 11 ]. This effect is 
presumed to result from of an adaptive hypersensitivity to low estrogen levels 
which over time, can lead to a paradoxical inhibitory effect of estrogen on 
breast cancer cell growth. A similar phenomenon has also been observed in 
vitro  in that in LTED cells (i.e., MCF-[ADDRESS_345860] cancer cells cultured under 
conditions of long-term estrogen deprivation), exposure to estrogen results in 
growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis [12]. In this regard, the current 
standard method of continuous daily dosing of EXE may not be as effective in 
inhibiting breast cancer cell growth, as sequencing intermittent periods of EXE

IRB #[ZIP_CODE]    October 25, 2013 
Version: [ADDRESS_345862] shown that  
reversal of resistance to tamoxifen can be achieved with the administration of  
estrogen [13,14], suggesting that  in patients with advanced, hormone receptor 
posi
tive breast cancer, resistance to anti-estrogen therapy may possibly be 
delayed by [CONTACT_283411]. 
An alternative hypothesis to account for the development of acquired resistance 
to EXE is the recent finding of elevated expression of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_47339] (EGF)-like protein, amphiregulin (AREG), in MCF-7 aro cells treated 
c
ontinuously with 1μmol/L of EXE. As AREG binds to the EGF receptor, it is 
postulated that AREG may mediate the development of acquired resistance to 
EXE via activation of EGFR and MAPK, leading to cell proliferation. As such, 
it is possible that intermittent withdrawal of EXE may also delay the 
development of acquired endocrine resistance due to diminished expression of 
AREG [15 ]. In addition to the potential beneficial effects of intermittent EXE 
therapy in terms of prolongation of time to drug resistance, this new method of 
drug scheduling may also allow improvements of other clinically important 
endpoints, such as better quality of life due to reduced exposure to drug-related 
toxicities. 
  
To c
orrelate with observations obtained in cell culture (i.e. that intermittent 
EXE therapy delays the time to re-growth of MCF-7aro breast cancer cells), the 
selected primary endpoint of this study will be progression free survival (PFS), 
although other clinically meaningful endpoints, such as objective response rates 
and clinical benefit will also be measured. That PFS correlates with acquired 
resistance to treatment is exemplified by [CONTACT_283412]
t as first line therapy, median duration of response to EXE was 
r
eported as 10 months [1]. However, as second [2] and third [3] line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
ti
me to tumor progression was reported as 20.3 weeks and 2 months, 
re
spectively. In other clinical trials in which EXE was used after multiple lines 
of
 prior endocrine therapy (≥ 2), including use of prior non-steroidal AIs, time 
to t
umor progression ranged between 14.7 weeks  to 3.7 months [4,5,16]. In 
view
 of these previously reported data and in consideration of the desire to be 
able to complete this study in a timely manner, we have chosen to measure PFS 
at 4 m
onths as a benchmark for comparison ([ADDRESS_345863] line patients, 
se
e statistical considerations) and as such, have incorporated eligibility criteria 
to re
flect the patient population from which these historical data were obtained 
[5,16]. The rationale for inclusion of this study population was also derived in 
c
onsideration of the hypothesis that after long-term estrogen deprivation of 
hormone
 receptor positive breast cancer cells in vitro , (presumed to be clinically 
equivalent to long-term exposure to anti-estrogens), estrogen may actually 
induce apoptosis [12 ]. 
 
 
3.0  TREATMENT PLAN  
 
3.1  Study Design  
 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]    October 25, 2013 
Version: [ADDRESS_345864] approved dose of EXE is 25 mg 
orally per day, after a meal. Absorption of EXE is rapid, and after peak plasma 
leve
ls are reached, plasma levels of EXE decline in a polyexponential manner, 
resulting in a terminal half life of approximately 24 hours. Given these 
pha
rmacokinetic properties and in consideration of convenience/ease of dosing, 
a 21-day treatment cycle, consisting of a schedule of 2 weeks on (consecutive 
da
ily dosing of 25 mg of EXE from Days 1-14), followed by 1 week off 
(c
essation of dosing from Days 15-21), will be used. 
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_345865] criteria, who require 
palliative radiation to a single site, will be permitted to receive treatment and 
remain on study. However, subjects with non-measurable disease who required 
palliative radiation to more than one site will be considered as having disease 
progression and will be taken off study. 
 
3.4  Number of Subjects  
 
 This trial will entail enrollment of a maximum of 36 patients for treatment, as 
discussed in section 6.0. The target accrual goal will be 18 subjects/year. 
 
3.5  Treatment Duration and Follow- Up 
 
 Study subjects will remain on treatment until disease progression, the development

R
ECIST criteria: 
 
 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Quick Referen ce 
 Eligibility 
Measurable disease  - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable 
disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3973]/histology .  
             Measurable lesions  - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
with longest diameter 
 [ADDRESS_345877] 
scan. 
        
    Non-measurable  lesions  - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 
m
m with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_345878] scan), i.e., bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal d isease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 12 lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not 
confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218]. 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or 
calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  
 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., 
skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 Methods of Measurement 
 
 CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure 
target lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be 
performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_345879] is preferable.  
 
 When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound 
(US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible 
alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, 
subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the 
complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_15077]. 
 
 The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not 
yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require 
sophi
sticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in 
some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor 
response should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers. However, 
such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained. 
 
 Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response when all lesions have disappeared. 
 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE]    October 25, 2013 
Version: 11 13 
 Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases 
(e.g., after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual 
malignant lesions). 
Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” lesions 
 All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions  and  
re
corded and measured at baseline.  
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_13458]).  
 A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions  will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by 
[CONTACT_62441]. 
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions  and 
shoul
d also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, 
but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 Response Criteria 
Evaluation of target lesions 
* Complete Respon se 
(CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
* Partial Response 
(PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD  
* Progressive Disease 
(PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of targ et lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions  
* Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking a s reference the smallest sum LD since the 
treatment started  
Evaluation of non-target lesions 
* Complete Response 
(CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level  
* Incomplete 
Response/          
Stable Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits

ircumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_283402] (or study

Evaluation of best overall response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria

Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
 Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to 
confirm the complete response status. 
 Confirmation 
 The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the 
response rate observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it 
should be made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses 
are not confirmed.

once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6-8 weeks) that 
is defined in the study protocol  
 Duration of overall response 
 The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that 
recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
 Duration of stable disease 
 SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.

tox
icities will be performed by [CONTACT_283413] (via telephone). The 
NCI, Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version  
3.0, available at http://ctep.cancer.gov//forms/CTAEv3.pdf) ), will be used as a guide to    
assess severity. To assess musculoskeletal adverse effects associated with EXE use, all  
subj
ects will complete modified Health Assessment Questionnaires (HAQ DI©) 
(A
ppendix A) at the start of each cycle of treatment, as previously validated [7, 17].  
 
5.4  Quality of Life Assessment (Appendix C)  
      
          For determination of quality of life associated with EXE use, the European         
 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
          Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) will be used. This instrument consists of a 30-item,   
          cancer-specific tool which encompasses measures of physical, emotional, cognitive        
          and social well being, in addition to measures of symptoms and overall quality of  
          life. Questionnaires will be completed at the start of every new cycle of treatment. 
       
5.5  Exemestane Drug Diary  
      
           To assess compliance with treatment, all patients will be supplied with a           
 
calendar of the treatment schedule at the start of each new cycle and will be  
         instructed to track their daily consumption of EXE at home. Completed calendars  
          will be collected at the end of each cycle of treatment.

6.0   STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
6.1  Maximum Accrual: 36 Subjects  
 
While toxicity is safely assumed to be reduced, the improvement in PFS is less clear and 
int
erim stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_283403] [5], 
a
re incorporated in the design. The following design operating characteristics were 
calculated by [CONTACT_283414], but the specific design chosen differs slightly from 
the Optimum or Minimax design to take into consideration the sawtooth nature of the 
powe
r function [18, 19].  Patients will be defined as a “success” or “failure” based on 
whether they have obtained the appropriate benchmark for median PFS (see below). An 
interim analysis will be performed at [ADDRESS_345882] 21 subjects 
a
re a “success”, the study will be stopped for futility.  If fewer than fourteen patients out 
of
 the 36 subjects are a success this will also be suggestive that this regimen does not 
warrant further study.  This design discriminates between an encouraging “success” rate 
of
 50% and a discouraging “success” rate of 30%.  The probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_283404] 50%, is 1% whereas the probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_283405] 30%, is 36%.The overall type II error for the decision on whether or not

eatment is promising is 7%, whereas the type I error is less than 17%, when

F
or second or third line patients (as was done prior to the amendment to include first line 
patients) if patients are progression-free at the 4 month evaluation this will be considered 
a success. Based on recent publication (e.g. Paridaens, et al , Vol 26, No. 30, pp-4883-
4890, J
CO 2008) the median PFS for first line patients on EXE is approximately 10 
months. As a result, we will view a “success” for first line patients if they are 
progression-free at [ADDRESS_345883] be accrued in order to obtain a reasonable 
e
stimate of the frequency of treatment related toxicities. One benchmark will look at the 
incide
nce of joint disorders,reported by [CONTACT_283415] [5], at approximately 30%. A one-
sided exact binomial test with a nominal 10% significance level, will have 81% power to 
de
tect a difference from a historical 30% complication rate, to a 15% complication rate 
with 36 subjects. Generally, however, if the PFS is equivalent to historical data, this will 
be
 considered successful, based on the assumption that reduced drug exposure will result 
in l
ess toxicity. While progression free survival (time to progression or death) at 4 
mont
hs (and 10 months)  is calculated as a binomial (all treated patients will count and

   8.3  Pharmacology  
 
           Kinetics :  EXE is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_283406]-fat food 
           increases plasma levels. It is metabolized hepatically via the CYP3A4 pathway and 
           converted into an active 17-dihydro metabolite. Routes of systemic excretion 
           of EXE consist of fecal (42%) and renal (42%), with < 1% of drug remaining 
     unchanged. Elimination half life is 24 hours. Based on experience with 
     EXE in m
ultiple doses up to 200 mg daily, the manufacturer does not  
     recommend dosage adjustment in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
           In postmenopausal women, suppression of plasma estrogen was observed 
           8-
24 h after single oral doses of EXE [20].

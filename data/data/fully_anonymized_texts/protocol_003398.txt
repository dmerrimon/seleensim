 1 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1. The primary objective  is to evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in the schedule -
modulated concomitant administratio n of erlotinib and pemetrexed, and in single 
agent pemetrexed in patients with advanced NSCLC as second -line chemotherapy.  
 
1.2. The secondary objectives  are: 
1.2.1.  To evaluate antitumor objective response rate (CR+PR) per RECIST criteria.  
1.2.2.  To evaluate disease contro l rate (response rate + stable disease, i.e., 
CR+PR+SD) and duration of response.  
1.2.3.  To evaluate median time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS)  
1.2.4.  To evaluate the safety profile of concurrent pemetrexed and erlotinib versus 
single agent pemetrexed.  
 
1.3. The correlative studies  are: to determine several molecular  and cellular biomarkers 
in the tumors , the skin and the serum  that are predictive of the efficacy of 
pemetrexed and erlotinib . Formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tumor (FFPE) blocks 
from diagnosis , fresh frozen tumor samples, skin samples, and peripheral blood will 
be collected from study patients who consent to these studies at the time of pre - and 
post-treatment.   
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Treatment for Advanced NSCLC  
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death throughout the world. Non -small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than 80% of all cases of lung cancer in the United 
States. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_13356], NSCLC patients who present 
with locally adv anced or metastatic disease have a dismal prognosis [1, 2] . In patients who are 
candidates for first -line cytotoxic chemotherapy, the clinical benefit of conventional cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (platinum doublets or non -platinum doublets) has reached a plateau of a median 
survival of 7.8 months [2, 3] . Combining new molecularly targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13357] -line 
combination cytotoxic chemotherapy [4] or combining molecul arly targeted agent with first -line 
cytotoxic chemotherapy doublets (E4599) [5] has extended the median overall survival to over 
12 months with sy mptomatic improvement in patients with advanced NSCLC.  
 
Currently, 40 -60% of patients with advanced NSCLC benefit from chemotherapy for disease 
control and symptom palliation during the course of their disease. Prior to May 2004, docetaxel 
(Taxotere; Aven tis Pharmaceuticals) was the only FDA -approved second -line chemotherapy 
agent for patients with advanced NSCLC. Although the response rate is <10%, docetaxel 
increases the 1 -year survival from 10% to 20% (from the time of study entry) and improved the 
quality of life when compared with best supportive care or old second -line chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [6, 7] . 
Our i mproved understanding of tumor biology and genetics, including the identification of 
critical genes related to the pathogenesis of NSCLC, has led to the development of several novel 
agents against the established cytotoxic targets and novel molecular targe ts. Several targeted 
agents have been introduced into the management of patients with NSCLC, mainly with 
advanced disease. Pemetrexed and erlotinib represent the two best examples of these novel 
agents that have been recently approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA for t he single agent second -line 
therapy of advanced NSCLC [8, 9] . Further mechanistic stu dies are needed in order to select 
 2 small subsets of patients that may benefit from each agent, or to improve the clinical efficacy by 
[CONTACT_13408].  
 
2.2  Pemetrexed (Alimta®) for Advanced NSCLC  
 Pemetrexed (Alimta®, formerly LY23 1514, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) is a 
novel multi -targeted antifolate that is primarily an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) with 
potent, but lesser, inhibition of glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase (GARFT)  and 
dihydrofolate r eductase (DHFR) , reactions required for DNA synthesis. The rational design and 
development of pemetrexed highlight the success of our improved understanding of the 
mechanisms of resistance to antifolates over several decades [10, 11] . Pemetrexed has a unique 
6-5 fused pyrrolo[2,3 -d]pyrimidine nucleus that is not present in other antifolates such as 
methotrexate and raltitrexed. Pemetrexed has favorable membrane transport properties and gains 
entry to the cell mostly via reduced folate carrier (RFC), or via a not yet fully characterized 
carrier in low pH optima [12, 13] ; to a lesser extent via membrane folate  binding protein 
transport systems (folate receptor α and β). [14] Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to 
polyglutamate forms by [CONTACT_13409] (FPGS). The pentaglutamate 
form of pemetrexed is the predominant intracellular form and is 60 -100-fold more potent than 
the monoglutamate in its inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS), with inhibition constants (Ki’s) 
of ~1 nM.  Polyglutamation is a t ime- and concentration -dependent process that occurs in tumor 
cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues [15]. Thus, pemetrexed has prolonged drug action 
in tumor cells. Inhibition of TS results in a decrease in thymidine, a pyrimidine necessary for 
DNA synthesis. Pemetrexed weakl y inhibits DHFR, which is required to reduce the 
dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, generated in the synthesis of thymidylate by [CONTACT_13410]. The rapid and 
marked suppression of TS by [CONTACT_13411].  Pemetrex ed also weakly (30 -200 times less potent than TS) inhibits GARFT (with a Ki’s 
of ~50 nM), which is involved in purine synthesis. In tumor cells that are exposed to a high dose 
of pemetrexed [16], or that have TS amplification [17], or that have a defect in RFC [18], 
inhibition of these folate -dependent enzymes for purine synt hesis has been related to the 
cytotoxicity of pemetrexed. Glutamyl hydrolase (GH) catalyzes the degradation of inter - and 
intracellular polyglutamates. All these targets implicated in the transport, activation, metabolism, 
and mechanism of pemetrexed are p otential biomarkers for the clinical activity of pemetrexed. In 
addition, deficiency in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) and folate (as indicated by 
[CONTACT_13412]) was suggested to correlate with pemetrexed 
toxicity [15, 19] . The significance of these enzymes/proteins in determining the clinical response 
to pemetrexed and erlotinib has not been evaluated carefully in published studies.  
 
 Preclinical data suggest that pemetrexe d has broad spectrum cytotoxic antitumor activity in a 
variety of solid tumors, including NSCLC [20]. In phase I studies, three dosing schedules were 
explored: daily x 5 every 3 weeks, weekly x 4 on a 6 -week cycle, and once every 3 weeks [21]. 
The dose limiting toxicity on all schedules was hematological, particularly neutropenia. Other 
side effects included fatigue, diarrhea, mucositis, cutaneous rash, and transient transaminitis. The 
addition of folate and vitamin B12 supplement resulted in a  significantly lower incidence of 
hematological and non -hematological toxicity without compromising the antitumor efficacy of 
pemetrexed [22]. The once -every -3-week schedule was the most convenient and had the highest 
response rate, and thus it w as selected for further clinical development. The maximum tolerated 
dose was 600 mg/m2 as a single agent, and 500 mg/m2 in combination with other 
myelosuppressive cytotoxic agents, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine and 
oxaliplatin [20]. 
 [ADDRESS_12925] shown significant efficacy (overall response rate) of 39 -45%, median 
survival of 8.9 -10.9 months, 1 -year survival of ~50%, and median duration of response of 6.[ADDRESS_12926] -line therapy for NSCLC [23, 24] . Second -line activity 
against NSCLC was demonstrated in a multi -center, randomized, open label ph ase III trial 
comparing single -agent pemetrexed with docetaxel. In that trial, overall response rate (9.1% 
versus 8.9%), median progression -free survival (2.[ADDRESS_12927] ratio of 0.97), 
time to progression (3.[ADDRESS_12928] ratio of 0.97), 1 -year survival (29.7% 
per arm), and median overall survival (8.[ADDRESS_12929] ratio of 0.99) were 
comparable between pemetrexed and docetaxel (Table 1). Although the study failed to show a 
statistically significa nt overall survival superiority or non -inferiority of pemetrexed, the side 
effects (grade 3 or 4 neutropenia: 5.3% versus 40.2%; febrile neutropenia: 1.9% versus 12.7%; 
use of granulocyte colony -stimulating factor support: 2.6% versus 19.2%) were significa ntly less 
for patients who received pemetrexed [25]. Pemetrexed has been combined with cisplati n, 
carboplatin and oxaliplatin, and promising clinical activity has been demonstrated in Phase II 
studies in advanced NSCLC, with modest toxicity. In summary, pemetrexed has a higher 
response rate and longer duration of response in the first -line setting, and lower level of 
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicity even in the second -line setting for advanced NSCLC. 
It is worthy of further study in combination with other drugs.  
   
Vitamin supplements with pemetrexed treatment . In early clinical development, pemetrexed was 
administered without vitamin supplements and was associated with significant mucosal and bone 
marrow toxicity. Increases in plasma homocysteine and cystathionine concentrations are 
associated with lower nadir ANC. Subsequent co -administratio n of l ow level dietary supplement 
of folic acid and vitamin B12 has significantly decreased the mucosal and bone marrow toxicity 
of pemetrexed without compromising its antitumor effect. Co-administration of oral folic acid or 
intramuscular vitamin B12 does  not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed [26]. Although 
the mechanisms underlying remain elucidated, preclinical studies in murine models suggest that 
changes in dietary folate intake can modulate high affinity folate receptor isoform expression and 
FPGS activity in different organs and tumor cells. These data support that the tissue distribution 
and toxicities of classical antifolates requiring polyglutamation for activation and cellular 
retention will be influenced significantly by [CONTACT_13413] [27, 28] . Most of our 
patients prefer to take multivitamin (MVI) supplement and most of the commercial MVIs 
contain [ADDRESS_12930] and Erlotinib HCL (Tarceva®) in 
NSCLC  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR, also known as HER1 or erb B) is a member of the 
ErbB tyrosine kinase recepto r family, which also includes HER2, HER3, and HER4. The ErbB 
receptors are present in the plasma membrane and share a common structure composed of an 
extracellular ligand -binding domain, transmembrane segment, and an intracellular tyrosine 
kinase domain. E rbB receptors are activated by a variety of receptor -specific ligands including 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF), transforming growth factor -alfa (T GF-α), amphiregulin, heparin -
binding EGF (HB -EGF), epi[INVESTIGATOR_13358], neuregulin, and betacellulin. As a result of ligand binding, 
receptor dimerization, trans -autophosphorylation, and initiation of signaling occur. Several major 
signaling pathways mediate the do wnstream effects of EGFR activation: the cell proliferation 
 [ADDRESS_12931] (Ras/Raf/MAP kinase), and survival pathway [phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase 
(PI3K)/Akt and Jak/Stat or protein kinase C (PKC)]. Many carcinogenic processes are mediated 
by [CONTACT_13414], proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasiveness.  
 
 The rationale for targeting HER1/EGFR for NSCLC treatment is as follows: 1) 40 -80% of 
NSCLC express HER1/EGFR by [CONTACT_13415]; 2) HER1/EGFR is frequently 
dysregulated in many solid tumors, including NSCLC  [29, 30] ; 3) HER1/EGFR activation 
initiates a signal transduction cascade that promotes tumor -cell proliferation and survival; 4) 
Overexpression/dysregulation o f HER1/EGFR is associated with poor prognosis; 5) 
Overexpression of HER1/EGFR can transform cells in a ligand -dependent manner; and 6) 
HER1/EGFR blockade inhibits tumorigenicity [31]. At least 4 mechanisms are implicated in 
dysregulation of EGFR pathways: overproduction of growth factors, over expression of  growth 
factor receptors, ligand -independent receptor activation, and initiation from cross -talk of other 
messenger substances, such as hormones and neutrotransmitters. Accordingly, targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13359] [32].  
 
Erlotin ib (Tarceva® formerly OSI -774), a quinazoline derivative, is a potent and highly 
selective, small tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the intracellular tyrosine kinase 
autophosphorylation, and subsequently prevents the receptor -mediated signaling pathway s. It 
reversibly competes with the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at the ATP -binding site within the 
intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the EGFR protein. Its mechanisms of action and 
clinical development have been extensively reviewed [31]. Erlotinib inhibits the growth of tumor 
cells, interferes wi th cell cycle progression, causing accumulation in G1 phase, and induction of 
apoptosis of a variety of tumor cell lines in vitro  and in vivo  [33]. In phase I studies, the 
recommended phase II dose and schedule was 150 mg daily by [CONTACT_1966]. The minimum plasma 
steady -state concentrations was above the targeted concentration at 1.2 0  0.62 g/mL, and the 
mean half -life was about [ADDRESS_12932] common side effects and dose -limiting toxicities 
were skin rash and diarrhea [34, 35] . Perez -Soler et al reported that erlotinib has a single agent 
activity of 12.3% in 57 EGFR+ patients with advanced NSCLC who failed first -line ci splatin -
containing chemotherapy [36]. Treatment was well tolerated, the most common adverse effect 
being a maculopapular acneiform rash in 44 pts (78%). In 731 EGFR unselected patients, a  
double -blind, international, randomized trial (BR.21) comparing erlotinib 150 mg by [CONTACT_13416], erlotinib had a response rate of 8.9%, as compared to the placebo had a response rate 
of less th an 1 percent (p <0.001). The median duration of the response was 7.9 months and 3.7 
months, respectively. Progression -free survival was 2.2 months and 1.8 months, respectively 
(hazard ratio, 0.61, adjusted for stratification categories; P<0.001). Overall s urvival was 6.7 
months and 4.7 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; P<0.001), in favor of erlotinib. Five 
percent of patients discontinued erlotinib because of toxic effects (Summary in Table 1) [37, 
38]. On No vember 18, 2004, the FDA approved erlotinib for treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.   
 
Although single agent activity of erlotinib in NSCLC has been confirmed, results fro m phase 
III randomized trials in patients with NSCLC reveal no additional benefit of erlotinib added to 
standard combination therapy carboplatin and paclitaxel, despi[INVESTIGATOR_13360]. Ma ny mechanisms have been 
proposed, including the timing of administration of erlotinib with chemotherapy, patient 
selection, tumor selection, suboptimal dosage and drug delivery schedule that leads to ineffective 
downstream molecular inhibition of EGFR. Mor e importantly, the preclinical targets of erlotinib 
 [ADDRESS_12933] few years. 
Several clinical predictors of response were observed: never smoker, female gender, 
adenocarcinoma histology (especially bronchioalveolar adenocarcinoma), and Japanese versus 
America n/Europeans. To this end, several cellular and molecular determinants were also 
demonstrated: the presence of EGFR intracellular tyrosine kinase domain mutations, and 
hyperactivated downstream signaling pathways, such as phosphorylated MAPK (p -MARK) or 
phosphorylated AKT (p -AKT). Several studies reported that the presence of two “hot spot” 
mutations in the exons 19 and 21 of EGFR TK domain correlated with the increased sensitivity 
(~80%) to EGFR -TKIs [39-43], and the prevalence of this  mutation is more present in 
Japanese/Chinese over Americans [39, 44] . However, there are no mutations present in most 
NSCLC patients that have stable disease in response to EGFR -TKIs. Other mechanisms must be 
accountable for this population of patients.

 [ADDRESS_12934] that a cquired resistance to erlotinib is associated with 1) 
marked downregulation of total and activated HER1/EGFR; 2) overexpression of genes involved 
in other signaling pathways, such as K-Ras mutation; 3) rare, cross -resistance to common 
cytotoxic agents [46]; 4) increased sensitivity to erlotinib in chemo -resistant cell lines as 
compared to parental cell lines in vitro  and in vivo [47].  This increase in sensitivity to erlotinib 
correlated with increased expression of pEGFR and total EGFR, suggesting that tumors resistant 
to conventional chemotherapy agents would likely become more dependent on the EGFR 
signaling pathway for growth and survival. These preclinical data are consistent with the clinical 
experience that erlotinib or gefitinib are active in patients who are refractory to chemotherapy. 
Several clinical s tudies evaluate the role of erlotinib in different stages of lung cancer treatment, 
with correlative studies to determine the molecular determinants of sensitivity or resistance to 
erlotinib treatment. Thus, the study proposed in this application is within  the scope of this global 
effort and will target patients with advanced NSCLC.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_12935] -line cytotoxic chemotherapy agents has 
failed to improve the clinical outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC in several large 
randomized controlled studies [48-51]. Several hypotheses have been propose d to explain this 
phenomenon.  We hypothesize that one possible solution is to optimize the proper delivery 
sequence of erlotinib and pemetrexed. Skipper et al first proposed the concept of modulating 
drug delivery schedule based on cell cycle effect in the  1960’s [52, 53] . This principle has 
surprisingly not been used more often for designing clinical combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13361] 
(also several reports at ASCO 2005). Fine et al found that although phase I stud y of combination 
of gemcitabine (G, Gemzar), docetaxel (T, Taxotere) and capecitabine (X, Xeloda) (GTX) had 
activity in patients with refractory pancreatic cancer, alternating T -GX delivery schedule based 
on their in vitro data of separating G1/S agents (g emcitabine, capecitabine) from G2/M agents 
(docetaxel) overcame the drug resistance with better tolerability in patients who failed GTX [54, 
55]. A phase II study is being conducted to confirm this result [56]. More relevantly, 
combination studies of pemetrexed and gemcitabine confirmed that sequence of drug delivery 
affects the antitumor activity in the preclinical and clinical studies [57-62]. Ma et al recently 
reported the results of a  randomized three -arm phase II study evaluating the optimum 
administration schedule of pemetrexed and gemcitabine in chemotherapy -naive patients with 
advanced NSCLC [59]. Patients were randomly assigned to three schedules as follows: schedule 
A, pemetrexed followed by [CONTACT_13417] 1 and gemcitabine on day 8; schedule B, 
gemcitabine followed by [CONTACT_13418] 1 and gemcitabine on day 8; and schedule C, 
gemcitabine on day [ADDRESS_12936] response rate of 31%, compared with schedules B and C, with 
response rates of 6.5% and 1 6.1%, respectively. Schedule B was discontinued after interim 
analysis because of a poor response rate. Regarding toxicities, schedule A resulted in less severe 
toxicity compared with schedule C. Schedule B, which had the lowest response rate, had the 
highest incidence of grade 3 and 4 febrile neutropenia (schedules A, B, and C: 5%, 19%, and 5%, 
respectively). The median survival time (schedules A, B, and C: 11.4, 10.3, and 11.8 months, 
respectively) and TTP (schedules A, B, and C: 4.7, 4.1, and 4.4 months,  respectively) were 
similar among the three schedules, consistent with a number of recent comparative combination 
studies for advanced NSCLC, in which improvement in objective response did not translate to 
improvement in survival or TTP. The most likely ex planation is that patients in schedule B or C 
 [ADDRESS_12937] in 
both erlotinib -sensitive and –resistant human NSCLC cells. The cytotoxic synergism is greater in 
erlotinib -resistant (combination index, CI, 0.75) than  erlotinib -sensitive (CI, 0.25) human 
NSCLC cells. The best cytotoxic synergism was achieved by [CONTACT_13419] -sensitive and erlotinib -resistant NSCLC cell lines. This cytotoxic 
synergism was associated wit h induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G 1 and G 2/M 
phases of the cell cycle [63] . It is worthy to emphasize that while there is no significant 
difference in the cytotoxicity of pemetrexed alone, addition of pemetrexed to erlotinib sensitizes 
the erlotinib -resistant cells to bo th agents and leads to comparable maximal synergistic 
cytotoxicity in erlotinib -sensitive NSCLC cells. Based on these results, the combination of 
pemetrexed and erlotinib might overcome the resistance to erlotinib alone and leads to the same 
synergistic cy totoxicity. This could be particularly important for the 90% of patients with wild -
type EGFR gene in the U.S. who are resistant (mimic clinical patients that are resistant) or less 
responsive (mimic clinical patients that have stable disease) to single age nt anti -EGFR therapy. 
The addition of pemetrexed to erlotinib could make these patients benefit equally from both 
agents as compared to those patients that are responsive to both of the single agents.  
 
Rationale for the sequential administration of pemetr exed followed by [CONTACT_13420].   No study has compared the clinical efficacy of concurrent pemetrexed and 
erlotinib versus single agent pemetrexed in patients with advanced NSCLC after first -line 
combinational therapy. In fact, n o studies  have ever demonstrated any clinical benefit of 
cytotoxic combination, either with other cytotoxic agent or with novel molecularly targeted 
agents, in patients with advanced NSCLC as a second -line treatment. Thus, we propose to first 
compare the PFS of sch edule -modulated concomitant administration of pemetrexed and erlotinib 
to single agent pemetrexed in the current study. In breast cancer, at least two studies have 
demonstrated the survival benefit of combinational chemotherapy over single agent 
chemothera py, although it is associated with higher toxicities and might be equivalent to the 
sequential single agent therapy [64-66]. There is no defined standard therapy for advanced 
NSCLC patients after the first -line comb inational therapy. The choice of pemetrexed, docetaxel, 
or erlotinib varies significantly in physicians and patients. Many new molecularly targeted agents 
have shown promise in improving the treatment outcome in this patient population. This could 
be a com pounding factor that might influence the interpretation of the current study, as discussed 
in details in the previous section [59]. Thus we would like to design an exte nsion study of single 
agent erlotinib for all patients who have progressed on or cannot tolerate pemetrexed. This is 
consistent with current acceptable clinical practice: to give the intravenous cytotoxic therapy 
before the less toxic and oral administrate d erlotinib when the patients’ performance status and 
organ function are still good. The sequence of pemetrexed followed by [CONTACT_13421] e chemo -resistant human NSCLC cell lines. In the erlotinib registration (BR.21) 
 8 study, 50% of patients had received 2 or more prior chemotherapy regimens, and similar clinical 
benefit was observed in these patients as compared to those patients who receive d only one prior 
chemotherapy [38]. Thus, we would choose the single agent pemetrexed over single agent 
erlotinib in the control arm (Arm A) in the current study. We intend to explore the clinical 
benefit of sequent ial pemetrexed and erlotinib by [CONTACT_13422] A after they fail 
single agent pemetrexed into the extended study of single agent erlotinib. We would estimate the 
overall survival between the concurrent versus sequential pemetrexed and erlotinib after the 
protocol.  Since the sample size is very small, it is only an exploratory study for hypothesis 
generating future study.  
 
Rationale for dose escalation of erlotinib in Arm B (the Concomitant Arm). Although well 
tolerated with most transient grades  1-[ADDRESS_12938] not observed significant objective 
response in patients receiving pemetrexed and erlotinib combination in our study. The safety of 
the same schedule of erlotinib and pemetrexed combination in solid tumor was recently reported  
[67].  Recommended phase II dose was pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on day [ADDRESS_12939] 22 
evaluable patients accrued in the study, nineteen were ex -smoker with a history of cigarette 
smoking for more than 15 pack -years and two were active smokers. According to the 
manufacture, p atients should be advised to stop smoking. If a patient continues to smoke, a 
cautious increase in the dose of TARCEVA, not exceeding 300 mg may be considered, while 
monitoring the patient’s safety. If the TARCEVA dose is adjusted upwa rd, the dose should be 
reduced immediately to the indicated starting dose upon cessation of smoking . We thus propose 
to revise the protocol to allow erlotinib dose escalation to 300 mg PO daily in smokers.  
 
2.5 Rationales for Correlative Studies  
 
Molecular an d Cellular Determinants of erlotinib    Several clinical predictors for response 
were observed in patients receiving anti -EGFR therapy: never smoker or light smoker, East 
Asians, female gender, adenocarcinoma histology (especially bronchioalveolar adenocarc inoma), 
the presence of skin rashes, and a history of prior immunologic or hormonal therapy. The 
molecular or cellular basis for these clinical predictors is largely unknown. Although the 
expression of EGFR status in patients does not correlate with surviv al or response in most of the 
clinical studies, we found that the resistance of NSCLC cells with either wild -type or mutated 
EGFR accompanied the loss of EGFR gene as determined by [CONTACT_13423]. Further mechanistic 
studies are ongoing in our laboratory. Several molecular and cellular determinants were 
suggested in the preclinical and clinical studies: the presence of sensitive or resistant mutations 
in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, the absence of K -Ras mutation in patients 
with EGFR mut ation, and hyperactivated downstream signaling pathways, such as 
phosphorylated MAPK (p -MAPK) or phosphorylated AKT (p -AKT). The most controversial 
issue is the role of EGFR mutations in predicting response to anti -EGFR therapy and prognosis 
of NSCLC patie nts. Several studies reported that the presence of two “hot spot” mutations in the 
exons 19 and 21 of EGFR TK domain correlated with the increased sensitivity (~80%) to EGFR -
TKIs [39-43], and the prevalence of this mutation is 2 -3 fol d higher in Japanese/Chinese over 
 9 Americans [39, 44] . But these mutations are seldom found in NSCLC patients that have stable 
disease in response to anti -EGFR therapy. Other mechanisms must be accountable for this 
population of patients. Our laboratory has previou sly demonstrated that: 1) t here was no cross -
resistance between erlotinib and common cytotoxic agents in vitro  and in vivo [47]; 2) at lea st in 
some human NSCLC cell lines, acquired resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy is accompanied 
with increased EGFR expression and subsequently increased sensitivity  to erlotinib [68]; 3) the 
basal levels of  activated downstream EGFR signal molecules (phosphorylated ERK1/2 and AKT 
proteins) correlate with the sensitivity or resistance to erlotinib better than the levels of 
phosphorylated EGFR/total EGFR [68]; and 4) NSCLC cell lines that harbor EGFR mutation 
have differential in vitro  cytotoxic sensi tivity to pemetrexed that are not related to their 
differential sensitivity to erlotinib [63]. The clinical and molecular determinants for pemetrexed 
are largely unknown currently. These data suggest that the presence of EGFR mutation in 
NSCLC cells alone is not enough to determine the sensit ivity to other cytotoxic 
chemotherapeutics such as pemetrexed. Thus, we propose correlative studies to determine the 
molecular and cellular determinants of patients who might respond to pemetrexed or erlotinib.  
 
Expression of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13362] (ETM) Markers and Sensitivity to 
Erlotinib    The expression of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13363] (such as E -cadherin, β -catenin) correlates 
with the sensitivity of NSCLC cells containing wild -type EGFR to erlotinib, whereas the loss of 
these epi[INVESTIGATOR_13364] (such as vimentin 
and/or fibronectin) correlate with resistance to erlotinib in in vitro  and in vivo  models [69, 70] . 
Furthermore, a small retrospective analysis of E-cadherin immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
expressio n on primary tumor samples from NSCLC patients suggests that the strong E -cadherin 
expression was associated with a significantly longer time to progression (n=28 and 37, 
respectively; hazard ratio, 0.37; log rank P=0.0028) and a nonsignificant trend towar d longer 
survival with erlotinib plus chemotherapy treatment versus chemotherapy alone [70]. We thus 
propose to determine the E -cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin  expression by [CONTACT_13424] N SCLC patients enrolled in this study, and to correlate the level of 
expression with clinical efficacy.  
 
Smoking and Response to Erlotinib in Patients with NSCLC    A history of significant 
smoking (>15 packs per year) has been suggested as one of the stron gest clinical predictors for 
the response to EGFR inhibitors [71, 72] . Its role in predicting response to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy is less well defined.  Accumulating data suggest that the inherited gene signatu re 
and functional cellular proteins of tumor cells determines their biological behaviors of growth, 
differentiation, survival, and metastasis and are critical for the sensitivity to therapeutic 
interventions. Cigarette smoking and increased exposures to in dustrial hazards are responsible 
for the 85 -90% of patients with lung cancer in the [LOCATION_002]. Many carcinogens, such as 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nitrosamines, are present in tobacco smoke. 
These carcinogens transform normal cells via  the formation of DNA adducts in target tissues 
and multiple genetic mutations in transforming genes, including K -Ras and p53 genes [73]. 
Some molecular alterations are already detectable before morphologic changes are apparent in 
the bronchial mucosa by [CONTACT_13425]. Mu tations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene or K -
Ras oncogene are the most prevalent mutations found in human cancers, including in 33% of 
p53 mutations and 20 -40% of K -Ras mutations in the lung adenocarcinoma. The frequency of 
the p53 mutation correlates wit h a higher average DNA adducts level in the lung tumors. 
Several inconsistent studies support a relationship between p53 or K -Ras mutations and the 
development, progression, or drug resistance of tumors. But they are hard to interpret since the 
 [ADDRESS_12940] and analysis techniques are not controlled. Greater than 90% 
of p53 mutations are reported as single amino acid substitutions within the central core domain 
of DNA binding (exons 5 -8). The p53 mutations provide tumor cells with a sele ctive growth 
advantage such as G2 checkpoint deficiency. K -Ras is a downstream signaling molecule in the 
EGFR signaling pathway. Most common mutations are missense mutation at codons 12, [ADDRESS_12941] observed early in the TRIBUTE study [74].  
 
In contrast to the old belief that the amount of cigarette smoking determines the amount of 
p53 or K -Ras gene mutations in patients with NSCLC, new data suggest specific EGFR 
mutations that are present exclusively in non -smokers or light smokers. These results suggest 
that NSCLC tumors in smokers and non -smokers have distinct tumor biology that result from 
completely different molecular pathways. Heterozygous somatic mutations observed most are 
deletions  or amino acid point mutations in exons 18, 19, and 21 of the EGFR gene, and are 
associated with increased sensitivity of NSCLC cells to erlotinib or gefitinib. Although the 
mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown, this important information shed s light 
for refining personalizing strategies for lung cancer therapy. More interestingly, a secondary 
resistant mutation in patients with primary EGFR mutations was identified (T790M) [75, 76] . 
This mutation occurs  in an analogous position to previously described secondary mutations in 
BCR -ABL, PDGFR -alpha, and c -kit that are associated with resistance to imatinib, which could 
be overcome by [CONTACT_13426], CL -387,785. The role of somatic mutations in EGFR  
in determining the sensitivity to cytotoxic agents is controversial and is not known for 
pemetrexed.  
 
Caveolin -1 (Cav -1) and NSCLC    Caveolin -1 (Cav -1) is an essential structural component of 
cell surface caveolae, whose structural integrity is essential  for many signaling processes 
including EGFR and estrogen receptor (ER). Down -regulation of Cav -1 gene has been 
implicated in several tumors including lung cancer. A recent report revealed that Cav -1 
expression in adenocarcinoma was significantly lower in never smokers compared to those in 
recent smokers [77]. Several additional evidence suggests that cav -1 is functionally related to the 
function of EGFR: 1) activation of Cav -1 by [CONTACT_13427] [78]; 2) absent or 
reduced Cav -1 expression is found in fibroblasts transformed by [CONTACT_13428] H -Ras 
(G12V) [79]; and 3) genet ic ablation of Cav -1 expression in a mammary –gland tumor 
susceptible model is associated with increased distant metastasis to the lungs. We recently 
reported that a Cav -1 P132L somatic mutation is present in 20% of ER+ human breast cancers 
and cause comple te loss -of-function of Cav -1 protein in a dominant -negative fashion. Additional 
Cav-1 mutations are present in 35% of ER+ breast cancers. The role of Cav -1 mutations in lung 
cancer is not known. We hypothesize that the Cav -1 mutations are associated with E GFR 
activation in non -smoking NSCLC patients. We will further explore their relationship with 
smoking -related gene mutations of p53 and K -Ras, and in sensitivity to erlotinib and/or 
pemetrexed.  See Appendix K  (Smoking Status Questionaire).  
 
Rash as a sur rogate marker of clinical response and survival    EGFR is expressed at high 
 11 level in the skin and play a vital role in normal physiological function and the skin. 
Dysregulation of EGFR is implicated in psoriasis, although the mechanism is poorly delineated  
and the good animal model for this disease is lacking. Treatments of all anti -EGFR therapeutic 
agents are associated with high incidence of skin changes (60 -90%). Although most patients 
tolerate the rash well, severe skin rash is one of the dose -limiting toxicities and may lead to 
treatment interruption or discontinuation. Analysis of previous clinical studies suggested that the 
severity of rash correlates with survival in patients receiving erlotinib. Although the mechanisms 
for rashes are largely unknown , several ongoing studies are evaluating the relationship between 
skin and tumor EGFR expression, the relationship between the severity of skin rashes and 
clinical efficacy. Our unpublished data suggest that acute inflammatory reaction is present in the 
skin of mice that have received oral erlotinib treatment. However, the role of this acute 
inflammatory reaction in humans is not known.

(pemetrexed followed by [CONTACT_13429]) synergism in vitro . This effect is present in both erlotinib -
sensitive and erlotinib -resistant human NSCLC cell lines that have wild -type EGFR gene . We 
hypothesize  that the schedule -modulated combination of pemetrexed  and erlotinib will improve 
the antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC. The objective  of this study is to 
determine the therapeutic efficacy of this schedule -modulated combination of pemetrexed and 
erlotinib in the second -line treatment of adva nced NSCLC patients.  In addition, we will explore 
the predictive biomarkers for the clinical efficacy of pemetrexed and erlotinib.  
 
The positive result of E4599 (carboplatin and paclitaxel ± bevacizumab as a first -line 
treatment for patients with advanced  nonsquamous NSCLC), together with other encouraging 
results of bevacizumab in combination of cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_13365] n with carboplatin and paclitaxel as a first -line treatment for patients with advanced 
nonsquamous NSCLC. Currently, there is not sufficient data to support the continuous use of 
bevacizumab in second -line setting after prior exposure. This new information  has made this 
proposed study more appropriate now as a second -line therapy for patients with advanced 
NSCLC. This highly significant project would not only prove the principle of modulating the 
drug delivery sequence for combining a molecularly targeted a gent with cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
it would also serve as a backbone for further addition of other novel molecularly targeted agents. 
In addition, it would have an immediate impact on the clinical management of patients with 
advanced NSCLC.

4. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
4.1  Agent Administration  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Alimta® (Pemetrexed) will be 
given intravenously over 10 minutes on day 1 of each 21 -day cycle. Tarceva® 
(Erlotinib) 150 mg PO is given o nce daily intermittently (Arm B). Tarceva® 
(Erlotinib) tablets should be taken once daily, preferably in the morning, with up to 
200 mL of water. It should be taken either one hour before or two hours after food. 
Patients should avoid grapefruit juice for the duration of the study. Each cycle will be 
21 days in length. Patients will continue on treatment until disease progression, or 
until any other criteria listed in section 4.3 are met.  
 
Appropriate dose modifications for Tarceva® ( Erlotinib)  and Alimta®  (Pemetrexed) 
are described in Section 5.  
 
Arm A: control arm  
 Alimta® (Pemetrexed) 500 mg/m2 given as a 10 -minute infusion on day 1, 
 15 with folic acid (in MVI form) and vitamin B12 supplement;  
 Repeat every 21 days until evidence of disease progression, int olerable 
toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or death  
 
Arm B: concomitant arm  
 Alimta® (Pemetrexed) 500 mg/m2 given as a 10 -minute infusion on day 1, 
with folic acid (in MVI form) and vitamin B12 supplement as indicated  
 Tarceva® ( Erlotinib)  150 mg PO  QD on days 2 -17 (16 days). A pi[INVESTIGATOR_13367], missed, and any side 
effect noted.(See Appendix H)  
 Repeat every 21 days for until evidence of disease progression, intolerable 
toxicity, withdrawal of informed cons ent, or death  
 
Premedication s for Pemetrexed:  
Folic Acid  
Folic Acid ( 400 µg, i.e., 0.4 mg ) must be given daily beginning approximately [ADDRESS_12959] dose 
of study therapy.  We will  provide the prescription for folic acid in multi -vitamin 
form. Patients will be advised not to take other form of multi -vitamins.  
 
Vitamin B 12 
Vitamin B 12 (1000 µg) will be administered as an intramuscular injection 
approximately [ADDRESS_12960] dose of Alimta®, and repeated 
approximately every [ADDRESS_12961] dose of study therapy.  
 
Dexamethasone  
Dexamethasone (4 mg of oral or equivalent) given twice daily should be taken on the 
day before, the day of, and the day after ea ch dose of Alimta® (Pemetrexed), for rash 
prophylaxis unless medically contraindicated.  
 
   Leucovorin  
Because folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation has significantly reduced the 
number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13368] 4 hematologic and Grade 3/4 nonhematologic t oxicities 
associated with Alimta therapy. A need for leucovorin as rescue agents is not 
anticipated. However, this section provides information should rescue be necessary.  
 
In clinical trials, leucovorin was permitted for CTC grade 4 leukopenia lasting > 3 
days, CTC Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 3 days, and immediately for CTC Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia, bleeding associated with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 or 
4 mucositis. The following intravenous doses and schedules of leucovorin were 
recommended f or intravenous use: 100mg/m2, intravenously once, followed by 
[CONTACT_13432], 50 mg/m2, intravenously every 6 hours for 8 days.   
 
4.2  Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout 
the study.  
 16  
Growth factors : Alimta® (Pemetrexed) or Tarceva® (Erlotinib) administration has 
not been associated with a high incidence of neutropenia. The incidence of grade 3/4 
neutropenia is 5.3% and <5%, respectively. Thus, the routine use of myeloid growth 
factor s is not recommended. In the case of a patient with febrile neutropenia  or grade 
4 neutropenia without fever , growth factors may be utilized per investigator 
discretion.  
 
Recombinant erythropoietin may be administered for symptomatic and/or progressive 
> grade 2 anemia according to current practice guideline.  
 
Antiemesis:  Suggested pretreatments could include a serotonin antagonist 
(granisetron, ondansetron), dexamethasone, and/or prochlorperazine.  
 
Bisphosphonates  may be administered for bone metastasis pe r investigator discretion.  
 
Therapy for Patients with Diarrhea and Febrile Neutropenia : Patients experiencing 
febrile neutropenia, especially with diarrhea, should be managed in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13369], with the urgent initiatio n of intravenous antibiotic 
therapy. Also see section 5.2 and 5.3 for recommendations for therapy for pemetrexed 
or erlotinib -induced diarrhea.  
 
Therapy for Patients with skin rash: See section 5.3.  
 
Clinically Significant Effusions : For patients who devel op or have baseline clinically 
significant pleural or peritoneal effusions (on the basis of symptoms or clinical 
examination) before or during initiation of Alimta therapy, consideration should be 
given to draining the effusion prior to dosing.  However, i f, the effusion represents 
progression of disease in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the patient should be 
discontinued from study therapy.  
 
4.3  Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until 
one of  the following criteria applies:  
 Disease progression,  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 General or specific changes in the patient's condit ion render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
4.4  After Protocol Therapy  
 
Patients enrolled in Arm A are encouraged to receive commercial single agent 
Tarceva® (erlotinib) in the extended study (Appendix J ) after they failed single agent 
Alimta® (pemetrexed). Patients enrolled in Arm B may go on to receive further 
 17 treatment at the discretion of the treating physician once they are discontinued from 
the study drugs.  
 
5. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
5.1    General  
 Dose adjustment at the starting of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir 
hematological counts or maximum non -hematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of 
therapy. Treatment may be delayed up to 2 weeks to allow sufficient time for rec overy. 
Upon recovery, patients will be considered for dose reduction as below:  
 
Treatment should be discontinued if a patient experiences any hematological or non -
hematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately if grade 3 or 4 
neurotoxicity is observed.  
 
5.2 Pemetrexed Dose Modification/Toxicity Management  
Pemetrexed should not be administered to patients whose creatinine clearance is <45 
mL/min using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formulation  or the measured glomerular 
filtration ra te (GFR) using the appropriate radiolabeled method (51 -CrEDTA or Tc99m -
DTPA) must be used to calculate CrCl for enrollment or dosing.  The same method used 
at baseline should be used throughout the study.  No dose reduction is recommended for 
patients whose  creatinine clearance is ≥ 45 mL/min. Insufficient numbers of patients have 
been studied with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min to give a dose recommendation. 
Therefore, Alimta should not be administered to patients whose calculated creatinine 
clearance is < 45 mL/min.  
 
Caution should be exercised when administering pemetrexed concurrently with NSAIDs 
to patients whose creatinine clearance is <80 mL/min.

Therapy for Diarrhea : In the event of CTC Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following 
supportive measures are allowed:  hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals. If diarrhea is 
severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or associated with fever or severe 
neutropenia (Gr ade 3 or 4), broad -spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed.  Patients with 
severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting must be treated 
in the clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13370].

disease after 2 cycles of treatment , erlotinib dose could be escalated by 50 mg one or 
twice to a maximal dose of 250 mg with less than grade 2 toxicities in the combination at 
the discrepancy of treating physician  (Table 4a) .  
 
If a patient experiences several toxicities, dose adjustments are to be made based on the  
greatest degree of  toxicity (ie, reducing the dose to the lowest level).  If significant 
toxicity is still apparent, the dose may be reduced a second time  (Table 4b) .  Any patient 
who fails to tolerate treatment of 50 mg/day will be withdrawn from the study.

5.3.2 Erlotinib Dose Modification/Toxicity Management  
 
Antidiarrheal and antirash medications may be introduced if clinically indicated.  
Previous phase [ADDRESS_12965] been rare reports of 
 19 hypokalemia and/or acute renal failure (including fatalities), secondary to severe 
dehydration, renal function and serum electrolytes (including potassium) should be 
monitored in this setting.  
 
Patients should be informed that skin toxicity is t o be expected during treatment with 
erlotinib.  Skin toxicity may take the form of dry skin, rash, acneiform eruption, or hair or 
nail changes.  Prophylactic treatment of the skin may prevent or reduce skin toxicity.  
The patient should be encouraged to us e an alcohol -free, emollient cream applied twice a 
day to the entire body as soon as the patient starts therapy with erlotinib.  Creams and 
ointments are recommended because they have a greater ability to retain moisture than 
lotions.  Examples of suitable  emollient creams include:  Neutrogena® Norwegian 
formula, SARNA® Ultra, Vanicream™, Aveeno® (fragrance -free formulation), and 
Eucerin® cream.  Other over -the-counter aqueous creams or emulsifying ointments may 
also provide symptomatic benefit.  Lotions sh ould be avoided because they often contain 
alcohol, which will dry the skin.  Patients should also be encouraged to use a titanium 
dioxide or zinc oxide -based sunscreen product applied to sun -exposed areas twice per 
day. 
 
Patients who develop skin toxicity  and are symptomatic should be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_13371].  If needed, oral minocycline or 
oral doxycycline may be combined with the topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588].  A topi[INVESTIGATOR_13372].  For more severe rash, oral corticosteroids 
may be beneficial.  Patients who fail to respond to these measures may have the dose of 
erlotinib interrupted or reduced.   
 
Minocycline is known to interfere with anticoagulants and oral contracep tives.  Patients 
treated with minocycline who are taking anticoagulants and/or oral contraceptives should 
be monitored accordingly.  
 
There have been infrequent reports of serious ILD, including fatal events, in patients 
receiving erlotinib for the treatmen t of NSCLC and other advanced solid tumors.  In the 
event of acute onset of new or progressive, unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as 
dyspnea, cough, and fever, study drug should be interrupted pending diagnostic 
evaluation.  If ILD is diagnosed, study dr ug should be permanently discontinued and 
appropriate treatment instituted as necessary.  
 
Erlotinib dosing should be discontinued for any severe toxicity that does not respond to 
treatment or failure to recover within 14 days from hematological toxicity at tributable to 
Tarceva.  
 
Management of other non -hematologic toxicity, therapy should be held until resolution to 
Grade 2 or less; for Grade [ADDRESS_12966] therapy discontinued.

Chemical Name :  [CONTACT_13468] L-Glutamic 
acid, N-[4-[2-(2-amino -4,7-dihydro -4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3 -d]pyrimidin -5-yl)ethyl] 
benzoyl] -, disodium salt, heptahydrate. The structural formula is as follows:  
 21  
 
 
Classification :  an antifolate antineoplastic agent.  
 
Molecular Formula : C20H19N5Na2O6•7H 2O  Molecular Weight : 597.49  
 
Mode of Action : 
Pemetrexed is an antifolate antineoplastic agent that exerts its action by [CONTACT_13433] -
dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.  
 
How Supplied :  
ALIMTA  is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder for int ravenous infusion available 
in single -dose vials. The product is a white to either light yellow or green -yellow 
lyophilized solid. Each 500 -mg vial of ALIMTA  contains pemetrexed disodium 
equivalent to 500 mg pemetrexed and 500 mg of mannitol. Hydrochloric  acid and/or 
sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH.  
 
NDC 0002 -7623 -01 (VL7623): single -use vial with flip -off cap individually packaged in 
a carton.  
 
Storage:  
ALIMTA , pemetrexed for injection, should be stored at 25 C (77F); excursions 
permit ted to 15 -30C (59 -86F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Chemical and 
physical stability of reconstituted and infusion solutions of ALIMTA  were 
demonstrated for up to 24 hours following initial reconstitution, when stored refrigerated, 
2-8C (36 -46F), or at 25  C (77F), excursions permitted to 15 -30C (59 -86F) [see 
USP Controlled Room Temperature]. When prepared as directed, reconstituted and 
infusion solutions of ALIMTA  contain no antimicrobial preservatives. Discard unused 
portion. ALIMTA  is not light sensitive.  
 
Route of Administration :  injection  
 
Preparation for Intravenous Infusion Administration:  
1. Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of ALIMTA  for 
intravenous infusion administration.  
2. Calculate the dos e and the number of ALIMTA  vials needed. Each vial contains 500 
mg of ALIMTA . The vial contains an excess of ALIMTA to facilitate delivery of label 
amount.  
3. Reconstitute 500 -mg vials with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection 
(preservative free) to g ive a solution containing 25 mg/mL ALIMTA . Gently swirl each 
 [ADDRESS_12968] 
quality. The pH of  the reconstituted ALIMTA  solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. 
FURTHER DILUTION IS REQUIRED.  
4. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not a dminister.  
5. The appropriate volume of reconstituted ALIMTA  solution should be further diluted 
to 100 mL with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free) and administered as 
an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes.  
6. Chemical and physical stabil ity of reconstituted and infusion solutions of ALIMTA  
were demonstrated for up to 24 hours following initial reconstitution, when stored at 
refrigerated or ambient room temperature [see USP Controlled Room Temperature] and 
lighting. When prepared as direc ted, reconstitution and infusion solutions of ALIMTA  
contain no antimicrobial preservatives. Discard any unused portion. Reconstitution and 
further dilution prior to intravenous infusion is only recommended with 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection (preservativ e free). ALIMTA  is physically incompatible with 
diluents containing calcium, including Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP and Ringer’s 
Injection, USP and therefore these should not be used. Co -administration of ALIMTA  
with other drugs and diluents has not been studied, and therefore is not recommended.  
 
Pharmacodynamics:  
Pemetrexed is an antifolate containing the pyrrolopyrimidine -based nucleus that exerts its  
antineoplastic activity by [CONTACT_13433] -dependent metabolic processes essential for 
cell repl ication. In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate 
synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate -dependent enzymes involved in the de novo 
biosynthesis of thymidin e and purine nucleotides. Both the reduced folate carrier and 
membrane folate binding protein transport systems transport pemetrexed into cells. Once 
in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by [CONTACT_13434]. T he polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are 
inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time - and concentration -dependent 
process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. 
Polyglutamated metabolites have an increa sed intracellular half -life resulting in 
prolonged drug action in malignant cells.  
 
Preclinical studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits the in vitro growth of 
mesothelioma cell lines (MSTO -211H, NCI -H2052). Studies with the MSTO -211H 
mesothelioma cell line showed synergistic effects when pemetrexed was combined 
concurrently with cisplatin. Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) following single -agent 
administration of pemetrexed to patients not receiving folic acid and vitamin B [ADDRESS_12969] erized using population pharmacodynamic analyses. 
Severity of hematologic toxicity, as measured by [CONTACT_13435], is inversely 
proportional to the systemic exposure of ALIMTA . It was also observed that lower 
ANC nadirs occurred in patients wi th elevated baseline cystathionine or homocysteine 
concentrations. The levels of these substances can be reduced by [CONTACT_13436] 
B12 supplementation. There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed exposure on ANC 
nadir over multiple treatment cycles . 
 
 23 Pharmacokinetics:  
The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed administered as a single agent in doses ranging 
from 0.2 to 838 mg/m [ADDRESS_12970] been evaluated in 426 
cancer patients with a variety of solid tumors. Pemetrexed is not metab olized to an 
appreciable extent and is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70% to 90% of the dose 
recovered unchanged within the first 24 hours following administration. The total 
systemic clearance of pemetrexed is 91.8 mL/min and the elimination half -life of 
pemetrexed is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 
mL/min). The clearance decreases, and exposure (AUC) increases, as renal function 
decreases. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma 
concentration (C max) increase proportionally with dose.  
 
The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed does not change over multiple treatment cycles. 
Pemetrexed has a steady -state volume of distribution of 16.1 liters. In vitro studies 
indicate that pemetrexed is appr oximately 81% bound to plasma proteins. Binding is not 
affected by [CONTACT_13437].  
 
Potential Drug Interactions :  
Chemotherapeutic Agents — Cisplatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
pemetrexed and the pharmacokinetics of total platinum is unaltered by [CONTACT_13438].  
 
Vitamins — Coadministration of oral folic acid or intramuscular vitamin B12 does not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed.  
 
Drugs Metabolized by [CONTACT_13439] P450 Enzymes — Results from in vitro studies with 
human liver micr osomes predict that pemetrexed would not cause clinically significant 
inhibition of metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, 
and CYP1A2. No studies were conducted to determine the cytochrome P450 isozyme 
induction potential of pem etrexed, because ALIMTA  used as recommended (once 
every 21 days) would not be expected to cause any significant enzyme induction.  
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] — Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], administered in low to moderate doses (325 mg every 6 hours), does 
not affect the pharmacokinetics of pem etrexed. The effect of greater doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_13373].  
 
Ibuprofen — Daily ibuprofen doses of 400 mg qid reduce pemetrexed’s clearance by 
[CONTACT_2902] 20% (and increase AUC by 20%) in patients with normal renal function. The eff ect 
of greater doses of ibuprofen on pemetrexed pharmacokinetics is unknown.  ALIMTA  
is primarily eliminated unchanged renally as a result of glomerular filtration and tubular 
secretion. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs could result in dela yed 
clearance of ALIMTA . Concomitant administration of substances that are also 
tubularly secreted (e.g., probenecid) could potentially result in delayed clearance of 
ALIMTA . Although ibuprofen (400 mg qid) can be administered with ALIMTA  in 
patients wi th normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80 mL/min), caution should be 
used when administering ibuprofen concurrently with ALIMTA  to patients with mild to 
moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 mL/min). Patients with 
mild t o moderate renal insufficiency should avoid taking NSAIDs with short elimination 
half-lives for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of 
 24 ALIMTA . In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between ALIMTA  
and NSAIDs with longer half -lives, all patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt 
dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following ALIMTA 
administration. If concomitant administration of an NSAID is necessary, patients should 
be monitor ed closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal 
toxicity.  
 
Special Populations:  
The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed in special populations was examined in about 400 
patients in controlled and single arm studies.  
Geriatric — No effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed was observed over a 
range of 26 to 80 years.  
Pediatric — Pediatric patients were not included in clinical trials.  
Gender — The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed were not different in male and female 
patients. 
Race — The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed were similar in Caucasians and patients of 
African descent. Insufficient data are available to compare pharmacokinetics for other 
ethnic groups.  
Hepatic Insufficiency —There was no effect of elevated AST (SGO T), ALT (SGPT), or 
total bilirubin on the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. However, studies of hepatically 
impaired patients have not been conducted.  
Renal Insufficiency — Pharmacokinetic analyses of pemetrexed included [ADDRESS_12971] ion. Plasma clearance of pemetrexed in the presence of cisplatin 
decreases as renal function decreases, with increase in systemic exposure. Patients with 
creatinine clearances of 45, 50, and 80 mL/min had 65%, 54%, and 13% increases, 
respectively, in pemet rexed total systemic exposure (AUC) compared to patients with 
creatinine clearance of 100 mL/min.  
 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with pemetrexed. Pemetrexed was 
clastogenic in the in viv o micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow but was not 
mutagenic in multiple in vitro tests (Ames assay, CHO cell assay). Pemetrexed 
administered at i.v. doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day or greater to male mice (about 1/1666 the 
recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basi s) resulted in reduced fertility, hypospermia, 
and testicular atrophy.  
 
Pregnancy  
Category D.  
 
Nursing Mothers  
It is not known whether ALIMTA  or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the  potential for serious 
adverse reactions in nursing infants from ALIMTA , it is recommended that nursing be 
discontinued if the mother is treated with ALIMTA .

6.2 Erlotinib (Tarceva®)  
Chemical Name : [CONTACT_13469] a quinazolinamine with the chemical name N -(3-
ethynylphenyl) -6,7-bis(2 -methoxyethoxy) -4-quinazolinamine. TARCEVA  contains 
erlotinib as the hydrochloride salt, which has the following structural formula:  
 
 
Other Names: CP-358, 774, [LOCATION_003]N: OSI -774 (Erlotinib) hydrochloride, Tarceva®   
 
Classification :  Signal Transduction Inhibitor, Tyrosine kina se Inhibitor (EGFR)  
 
Molecular Formula : C22H23N3O4.HCl  Molecular Weight : 429.90  
 
Mode of Action :  
The mechanism of clinical anti -tumor action of erlotinib is not fully characterized. 
Erlotinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase associated with the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR). Specificity of inhibition with regard to other 
tyrosine kinase receptors has not been fully characterized. EGFR is expressed on the cell 
surface of normal cells and cancer cells.  
 
How Supplied :  
Erlotinib tablets are available in 25 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg erlotinib and contain the 
following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl 
cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, 
sodiu m lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide.    All tablets are round, white, film -coated bi -
convex tablets without markings.  Tarceva® (erlotinib hydrochloride) will be supplied by 
[CONTACT_13442], Inc., Melville, NY.  
 
Storage:   
The intact bottles should be  stored at controlled room temperature15°C -30°C - (59°F and 
86°F).  Tarceva® tablets are supplied in blue -white high -density polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottles of 30 each with some overage.  
 
Route of Administration :  Oral.  
 
 28 Method of Administration  
Tarceva® table ts should be taken at approximately the same time each day.  Each 
Tarceva® dose is to be taken with up to 200 mL (~ 1 cup or 8 oz) of water one hour 
before or two hours after meals or medications, including vitamins and iron supplements.  
Tarceva® should n ot be taken with grapefruit juice.  The entire dose must be taken at one 
time.  If the patient vomits after taking the tablet(s), the dose is replaced only if the 
tablet(s) can actually be seen and counted.  
• Administration through G -tube: The tablets requ ired for the dose should be dissolved in 
100 mL of sterile water. The dissolved tablets should be shaken vigorously to form a 
uniform suspension. The suspension should be drawn up into a syringe and administered 
through the G -tube port. Repeat the syringe transfer until the entire volume has been 
administered. A small volume (40 mL) of sterile water should be added to the container 
used to dissolve the tablets and the residual suspension should be shaken, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_13378], and administered. This last step should be repeated to ensure the entire dose is 
administered. The total volume of delivery/rinse (as per procedure submitted to IND) is 
~180 ml.  
 
Formulation  
OSI-774 is an off -white to pale yellow powder. The pharmaceutical preparations of OSI -
774 are  formulations containing the hydrochloride salt (OSI -774-01). In addition to the 
active ingredient, erlotinib tablets contain lactose (hydrous), microcrystalline cellulose, 
sodium starch glycolate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and magnesium stearate. Initial cli nical 
studies with OSI -774 used both a tablet and an oral powder for constitution (OPC) in 
water.  Study drug for daily oral administration will be supplied as 25mg, 100mg and 
150mg tablets in separate bottles, containing 30 tablets with some overage.    
 
Expected adverse events: The side effects of Tarceva® may include but are not limited to:  
Common (occur in more than 20% of patients):  
 Skin rash  
 Diarrhea (this may be treated with anti -diarrhea drugs)  
 Loss of appetite  
 Tiredness or fatigue  
 New or worse shor tness of breath  
 Cough  
 Nausea  
 Vomiting  
 Infections  
 Itching  
 Weight loss  
 Dry skin  
 
Less Common (occur in 5% -20% of patients):  
 Dehydration (loss of too much body fluid)  
 Dry, red, irritated eyes  
 Abdominal or stomach pain  
 Depression  
 Gas, heartburn or upset stomac h 
 Headache  
 Neuropathy (nerve damaging resulting in numbness or tingling)  
 29  Chills or shakes  
 Chest pain  
 Nose bleeds  
 Coughing up blood  
 Hair loss or thinning  
 Dry mouth  
 Fever  
 Mouth sores or mouth ulcers  
 Constipation  
 
Rare (occur in less than 5% of patients):  
 Change sin liver function tests which may indicated liver damage; isolated reports of 
liver failure  
 Damage to the front eye, which may lead to changes in vision.  
 Irritation of stomach or bowel which may lead to ulcers (lining breakdown) or 
bleeding  
 ILD (Inter stitial Lung Disease).  An irritation of the lungs, which rarely may be 
severe, and life threatening.  
 Decreased liver function; isolated reports of kidney failure  
 Changes in the sense of taste  
 Severe infections which may be life threatening  
 Increased risk of bleeding in patients who have low platelet count, are taking blood 
thinners, or are taking certain drugs for pain called NSAIDs such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_13379]  
 Fingernail/toenail changes and/or irritation of skin around nails  
 Possible cracking of skin, esp ecially of finger and toes  
 Isolated reports of increased body hair growth or eyelash/eyebrow changes  
 
 Incompatibilities / Potential Drug Interactions  
Tarceva ® is both protein bound (92% to 95% in humans) and metabolized in the liver by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4 and, to a le sser extent, CYP1A2, and in the lungs by [CONTACT_097]1A1.  A potential for 
drug-drug interaction exists when Tarceva ® is co-administered with drugs that are highly 
protein bound or that are CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitors/inducers.  
 
For patients who are being concomit antly treated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, a dose 
reduction should be considered in the presence of severe adverse events.  For patients 
who are being concomitantly treated with a potent CYP3A4 inducer, alternative 
treatments that lack potent CYP3A4 -inducing properties should be considered.  
 
Tarceva ® clearance can be induced by [CONTACT_13443]1A2 induction.  Smokers should 
be advised to stop smoking while taking Tarceva ®, as plasma concentrations of 
Tarceva ® are reduced due to the effect of cigarette smo king.  
 
Grapefruit juice is a CYP3A4 inhibitor that interferes with the metabolism of Tarceva ®.  
Therefore, consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be avoided during 
Tarceva ® treatment.  
 
In addition, altered coagulation parameters and bleeding have been reported in patients 
receiving Tarceva ® alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents and 
 30 concomitant warfarin -derivative anticoagulants.  The mechanism for these alterations is 
still unknown.  When warfarin is coadministered with T arceva ® (anytime after Day 5), 
international normalized ratio (INR), and prothrombin time should be closely monitored 
and the anticoagulant dose should be adjusted as clinically indicated.  
Pregnancy   Category D.   
Nursing Mothers  It is not known whether erl otinib is excreted in human milk. Because 
many drugs are excreted in human milk and because the effects of TARCEVA® on 
infants have not been studied, women should be advised against breast -feeding while 
receiving TARCEVA® therapy.  
Pediatric Use  The safety and effectiveness of TARCEVA® in pediatric patients have not 
been studied.  
Geriatric Use  Of the total number of patients participating in the randomized trial, 62% 
were less than 65 years of age, and 38% of patients were aged 65 years or older. The 
surviva l benefit was maintained across both age groups. No meaningful differences in 
safety or pharmacokinetics were observed between younger and older patients. Therefore, 
no dosage adjustments are recommended in elderly patients.  
Patient Implications  
Patients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit juice for the duration of the study.  
Special caution should be taken for patients taking warfarin.

7. CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 Informed consent (Appendix A) must be signed prior to obtaining and/or submission  of 
any materials for the laboratory correlative studies.  
 
7.1  Statement of Hypotheses and Objectives:  
 As reviewed in previous sections, less than 10% of patients with advanced NSCLC in the 
[LOCATION_002] have objective response to monotherapy of erlotin ib or pemetrexed. Correlative 
studies to select the subgroup of patients that might benefit from erlotinib and/or pemetrexed in 
advanced NSCLC, a disease in which clinical benefit of these agents has been demonstrated, are 
demanded.  
  
Based on the literat ure and our preliminary data, we hypothesize  that: 
 31 1) The mutations in the K -Ras and/or p53 genes correlate with a history of >15 PY of 
smoking and clinical resistance  to erlotinib and/or pemetrexed; while the mutations in the 
EGFR and caveolin -1 genes (th at are related to non -smoking or light smoking) will 
correlate with a history of ≤ 15 PY of smoking and clinical sensitivity  to erlotinib and/or 
pemetrexed.  
2) High gene copy number of EGFR in NSCLC tumors correlates with more dependent of 
these tumor cel ls on the EGFR signaling transduction pathway for tumor growth and 
survival, and thus clinical sensitivity  to erlotinib and/or pemetrexed.  
3) Effective inhibition of active EGFR axis (i.e., p -EGFR and activated down -stream 
effectors) and/or folate -depende nt tumor metabolism (TS and associated drug metabolism 
genes) correlate with increased clinical benefit from erlotinib and/or pemetrexed 
respectively.  
4) The expression of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13380] (EMT) Markers and sensitivity to 
erlotinib.  
5) The presence of ≥ grade 2 skin changes is associated with erlotinib -associated inhibition of 
pEGFR and immune and inflammatory changes in the skin, which correlate with clinical 
response and patient survival to erlotinib and/or pemetrexed.  
6) Patients wh o develop significant skin rashes have more competent T -cell mediated 
immunity that correlate with better clinical outcome.  
 
The overall objective  of the correlative studies is to determine several molecular  and cellular 
biomarkers in the tumors  and the skin that are predictive for the clinical efficacy of pemetrexed 
and erlotinib . More specifically,  
7.1.1 To determine the presence of known “hot spot” mutations  in genomic DNA in the 
intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR gene, exon 2 of K -Ras gene, exons 5-8 of 
p53 and the transmembrane domain of caveolin -1 gene, and to determine their 
correlation with smoking and with clinical response to erlotinib and/or pemetrexed.  
7.1.2 To determine pre -treatment gene copy number  of EGFR gene and to determine its 
association  with clinical benefit of erlotinib with or without pemetrexed.  
7.1.3 To determine the altered protein  expression in the EGFR signaling axis and folate -
dependent target/metabolism axis [i.e., p -EGFR, p -AKT, p -MAPK, p -STAT, p27, 
cyclin D1,  E-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, thymidylate synthase (TS) , reduced folate 
carrier (RFC) , folate receptor, folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) , glutamyl 
hydrolase (GH) ] by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) and to determine the correlation of 
these changes to clinical efficacy and su rvival.  
7.1.4 To determine the presence of ≥ grade 2 skin changes  is associated with inhibition of 
pEGFR and erlotinib -associated immune and inflammatory changes (i.e., cytotoxic T 
cells, macrophage, interferon γ, IL -10, TGF beta)  in the skin, which correlate with 
clinical response and patient surv ival in relation to erlotinib and/or pemetrexed.

7.3.1  Tissue requirements:  
Tumor samples : We will put all efforts to obtain at least the diagnostic tissue blocks for the 
correlative studies.  Tumor tissues will be available from the diagnostic biopsy . Pre - and post -
treatment tumor biopsies will be obtained if there are accessible tumors by [CONTACT_4654] -guided biopsy or 
brush and wash samples by [CONTACT_13445]’s consent. From our previous experience, 
2-[ADDRESS_12974] also been reported as a good source for correlative studies [76]. 
The tumors will be embedded in OCT solution or snap frozen in a liquid nitrogen bath. Aliquots 
of tumors will be fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin.  
 
Skin samples : Serial 3mm -punch skin biopsies under local anes thesia on the back of upper 
torso are minimal invasive and can be done within 20 minutes during an outpatient visit. This is 
required for all patients enrolled in the study who consent to the biopsy, with or without the 
presence of grade 2 or above skin ra sh after initiation of erlotinib. A separate or immediate after 
clinic visit with the P.I. (TL) might be arranged to perform the skin biopsy as needed.  These 
samples (~400 mg) will be snapped frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and embedded in 
paraffin .   
 
Timing of tumor or skin biopsy : Pre-treatment biopsy could be obtained [ADDRESS_12975] dose of erlotinib in mice 
([80, 81]  and data not shown), thus we will perform post-treatment skin biopsy during da ys 5-12 
(8 days) of cycle 2 or 3 of pemetrexed and/or erlotinib treatment .  See the following schemas.

7.3.2  Tissue resources:  
The following tissue resources are allowed to collect tissue samples at the time of initial 
diagnosis, pre - and post -treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks  
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignant pleural effusion  
[IP_ADDRESS] E ndobronch ial brush and wash  
[IP_ADDRESS] CT -guided core biopsy of tumor  
[IP_ADDRESS] Punch biopsy of skin

7.3.3  The following assays will be performed:  
1. Histological Evaluation  
2. DNA isolation and mutational analysis  
3. FISH  
4. Tissue microarray (TMA) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC)  
5. ELISPOT assay  
 
Histological Evaluation:  Specimens will be evaluated by [CONTACT_13446] (H&E) 
stain for the following assessments: 1) percentage of variable tumor; and 2) non -neoplastic 
adjacent normal tissue.  
 
DNA I solation and Mutational Analyses:  Tumor cells will be isolated on sections from FFPE 
tissue blocks by [CONTACT_13447] 75% of tumor. If the slides 
consist of less than 75% of tumor, we will first isolate tumor cells from n ormal cells on the slide 
onto a thin polymer film (CapSure LCM Caps, Arcturus, Mountain View, CA)  by a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_13381] (LCM) System (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA). The tumor cells 
will be dissociated from the film in proteinase K -containing lysis buffer.  The 75% is chosen 
arbitrarily. Our previous experience reveals that we can detect a heterozygous point mutation by 
[CONTACT_13448] 15% (data not shown). An estimate of 3,[ADDRESS_12976] 10 PCR reactions. As normal controls, DNA isolated from adjacent normal lung 
tissues either by [CONTACT_13449] (if normal tissues is >75%) will be used.   
  
Genomic DNA will be isolated from tumor samples by [CONTACT_13450] (Qiagen). Targeted 
gene segments will be amplified by [CONTACT_13451] (for EGFR exons 19, 2 0, and 21 deletions or 
mutations, K -Ras mutation, Cav -1 mutation) [82, 83]  or by [CONTACT_13452] -directional sequencing. The 
sensitivity for the former test is about 5% and the sequencing is about 15%. The mutation rate of 
K-Ras, p53, EGFR, and caveolin -[ADDRESS_12977] established all these methods in the laboratory.    
 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):  Recent studies suggest that a high copy number of 
EGFR gene is associated with increased response to erlotinib [84, 85]  and/or survival in patients 
with adv anced NSCLC [86]. We will determine the EGFR gene copy number using a rchival 
paraffin -embedded tissue blocks fro m routine diagnostic study. We will use the NSCLC cell 
lines that are known to have normal copy or amplified EGFR gene as negative and positive 
controls. The EGFR gene copy number is determined by [CONTACT_13453] -color DNA 
FISH probes specific for the EGFR locus (7p12) and the CEP7 chromosome 7 centromere 
(7p11.1 through q11.1). The result will be classified according to published six FISH categories 
[87]. EGFR amplification is defined as EGFR: CEP7 ≥ 2 or ≥ 15 per cell in ≥ 10% of cells [84]. 
In previous publication, 33 -100 nonoverlappi[INVESTIGATOR_13382]7 signals observed as well as the pattern of distribution  of signals 
[84]. The studies will be performed at the Cytogenetic Laboratory in the Department of 
Pathology under the supervision of [CONTACT_13472].  
 
Tissue Microarray:  The development of tissue arrays allows the eval uation of each of many 
proteins in many sets of normal and tumor tissues using a single slide for each probe. It provides 
a powerful way to follow up the candidate protein changes proposed in this study with control of 
technical variation. We  will determin e the changes in protein  expression on tissue microarray 
(TMA) by [CONTACT_13454]. Five -m sections of normal and tumor tissues 
embedded in par affin will be stained with H&E to identify morphologically representative area 
of normal and tumor tissues, from which core biopsies will be taken. The tissue microarray will 
be done with the Tissue Arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD). From ea ch specimen 
(donor), tissue cores with a diameter of 0.6 or 1.0 mm are punched and arrayed on a blank 
paraffin block (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]). The spacing between the centers of two adjacent specimens on the 
array ranged from 3 mm to 8 mm. Two to three hundred cores co uld be created within the array 
block. Then the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_13383] 370C oven for 1 hour to soften the paraffin and 
melt the surface of the block.  
 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC):  Tissue arrays containing diagnostic, pre - and post -treatment tumor 
and normal human NSCLC tissues (as described above) will be cut in 5 -µm sections, 
deparaffinized, rehydrated,  and quenched with 1.5% H 2O2. For EGFR studies, the slides will be 
treated with DakoCytomation Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_13384], CA) in  a steam 
bath at 95°C for 45 minutes. After equilibration in PBS for 15 minutes, the slides were placed in 
an autostainer (DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_13384], CA) and stained with antibodies to EGFR (DAKO; 1:100 
dilution). Immunoreactivity will be detected using DAKO EnVis ion methods (DAKO) according 
to the manufacturer recommended procedures. The activated EGFR is detected using antibodies 
against the phosphorylated forms of EGFR (p -EGFR). Similar IHC staining will be performed 
using with antibodies specific for p53, K -Ras, caveolin -1 and other proteins as described 
previously. [88] For negative controls, slides will be treated with the same procedure, including 
antigen retrieval , except for omission of the primary antibodies. The level of expression will be 
assessed as percentage of positive staining cells, and scored as 0 (0%), +1 (1 -25%), +2 (26 -50%) 
and +3 (51 -100%) as described before [89]. Cell pellets from human NSCLC cell lines known to 
be positive or negative for EGFR will be used as positive or negative controls for EGFR 
expression. Negative controls will also be  performed by [CONTACT_13455]. A 
 35 sample of recording IHC results is illustrated in Appendix I.  
 
Human IFN -γ ELISA:   We will collect 5 ml of peripheral blood using citrate, EDTA, or heparin 
as anticoagulant from the patients before and 2 weeks after treatment. Plasma will be collected 
by [CONTACT_13456] 10 minutes at 1000 x g within 20 minu tes of collection. The plasma 
will be stored at ≤ 20°C or shipped on dry ice. We will analyze the patient plasma samples for in 
vitro T -cell function by [CONTACT_13457]. A positive interferon 
gamma (IFN -γ) response to a common a ntigen (such as whole influenza virus or EBV) will be 
used as a control. The results will be correlated to the skin changes and clinical outcome of the 
patients.

Ras/p53/caveolin -1 gene mutation status (present/absent), EGFR gene amplification by [CONTACT_4656] 
(present/absent) and other categorical markers with clinical outcome will be analyzed using the 
chi-square or Fisher’s exac t when the outcome is clinical response.  Levels of continuous 
markers and changes in pre - and post -treatment levels will be compared between responder 
groups using the two -sample t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, depending on the distribution of 
the data.   When the outcome is progression -free survival, time to progression, or overall survival, 
standard time -to-event methods will be applied. Treatment specific analyses as well as 
multivariate analyses may also be performed provided the numbers of events are  sufficient.

 [ADDRESS_12981]  
 
For the p urposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 3 weeks.  
In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following 
initial documentation of objective response.  
 
9.1. Definitions  
 
Response and pr ogression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) 
Committee [90]. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  Note:  Lesions are either 
measurable or non -measurable using the criteria provided below.  The ter m 
“evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_12982] one dimension (longest diameter  to be recorded) as >20 mm with 
conventional techniques (CT, MRI, x -ray) or as >[ADDRESS_12983] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions 
of centimeters).  
 
9.1.2 Non-measurable disease  
All other lesions (or sites of  disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_12984] 
scan), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cuti s/pulmonis, 
inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), 
and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
 
9.1.3 Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 
lesions in total, representative of al l involved organs, should be identified as 
target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and 
their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (eit her by [CONTACT_13458]).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline 
sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_13459] e. 
 
9.1.4 Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Non -target lesions include 
measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers per organ or total of all 
involved organs as well as non -measurable lesions.  Measurements of these 
 38 lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
9.2  Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken  and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 6 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might 
not be considered measurable.   
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based  evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_13460] a treatment.  
 
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nod ules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray.  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI.   These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_12985], 
abdomen, and pelvis.   
 
Tumor markers .  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.   
 
Cytology and Histology.   These techniques can be used to differentiate between 
partial respo nses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual 
lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign 
tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
9.3  Response Cri teria  
 
9.3.1  Evaluation of target lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions  
 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
 [ADDRESS_12986] diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest 
sum LD recorded since the treatment started or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions  
 
Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shri nkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking 
as reference the smallest sum LD since the 
treatment started  
 
 
9.3.2  Evaluation of non -target lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalizati on of tumor marker level  
 
Incomplete Response/   
Stable Disease (SD):   Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target 
lesions  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, in 
such circumstances the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13387], and 
the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] 
(or study chair).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_12987] response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  The patient's best response ass ignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria (see section 
9.3.1).

Note:  
 Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time sho uld be classified as having “symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression, even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
 In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease 
from normal ti ssue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends 
on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be 
investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete 
response status.

Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is the time from randomization until objective tumor 
progression or dea th from any cause.  PFS is censored at the date of the last follow -up 
visit for patients who are still alive and who have not progressed.  Overall survival 
(OS) time is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due 
to any cause.  
 
9.6  Response Review  
 
All responses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study at the study’s 
completion.  
 
 
10. REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 3.0 (Appendix C). A 
list of adverse events that have occurred or might occur (Reported Adverse Events and 
Potential Risks) can be found in Section 6 (Pharmaceutical Information).  The reported 
procedures to be followed are presented in the investigators’ brochures.    
 
10.1 Expedited  Adverse Event Reporting  
(AE; formerly known as Adverse Drug Reaction)  
 
Study site personnel must notify the Sponsor (Montefiore Medical Center), Eli Lilly 
and Company , OSI Pharmaceuticals, and all participating investigators and sites 
immediately of any “serious” (defined below) adverse event experienced by a patient.  
In addition, adverse events must be reported to regulatory authorities according to the 
definitions a nd timelines specified in the local laws and regulations.  
Serious events are defined as those that result in:  
 Death.  
 Initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 A life -threatening situation (where the patient is at immediate risk of 
death).  
 Severe or p ermanent disability.  
 Congenital anomaly.  
 Or, is significant for any other reason.  
 
Serious adverse events occurring after a patient is discontinued from the study will 
NOT be reported unless the investigator feels that the event may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_13462] a protocol procedure.  Study -specific clinical outcomes of death 
 42 because of disease progression are exempt from serious adverse event reporting, 
unless the investigator deems them related to use of the study drug.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13388] a serious adverse event.  
 
In general, serious adverse events assessed as clearly being due to disease 
progression, and not due to study drug(s), should be excluded from adverse event 
reporting. However, in cases where the specifi city or severity of an event is not 
consistent with the risk information, the event should be reported.  
 
10.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events Associated with Pemetrexed (Alimta ) 
 
Pharmacovigilance Fax Number for Alimta Related SAEs:   [PHONE_234]  
 
10.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events Associated with Erlotinib (Tarceva ) 
All serious adverse events that are considered related  to Tarceva treatment must be 
recorded on a MedWatch 3500 Form and faxed within 1 business day to:   
 
OSI Drug Safety: Fax number: 30 3-546-7706  
For questions related to erlotinib safety reporting, please call the phone number 303 -

MedWatch 3500 Reporting Guidelines:  
Note:  MedWatch 3500 forms and other information related to MedWatch reporting 
are available at http://www.fda.go v/medwatch/index.html . 
 
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic, suspect medication and 
reporter information, the report should include the following information within the 
Event Description of the MedWatch 3500 form:  
– Protocol description  (and number, if assigned)  
– Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome if known  
– Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics  
– Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to each 
investigational product and suspect medicati on 
 
10.4 Reporting of Regulatory Documents (Protocol Deviations, Violations, or 
Amendments):    
  
 All sites should first submit their regulatory documents, including protocol 
deviations, violations, amendments, or others, to the Sponsor (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Roman Perez -
Soler , Montefiore Medical Center). The Sponsor will submit any significant changes 
to Eli Lilly and Company, OSI Pharmaceuticals, and all participating investigators 
and sites.  
 
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Study Design/Analytic Plan  
 
The primary statistical objectives of this randomized Phase II study are to obtain 
 43 preliminary estimates of the magnitude and variability of the efficacy of combination 
treatment with Alimta® and Tarceva®.  Data from the control arm, single agent 
Alimta®, will be used  to evaluate whether the observed efficacy in this study 
population is similar to the expected efficacy based on prior studies and aid in the 
interpretation of the results on the concurrent arm [91]. The two treatment arms will 
not be formally compared.  
 
The primary endpoint of the study is progression - free survival (PFS).   PFS is 
defined as the time from randomization until documented tumor progress ion or death 
from any cause. PFS is censored at the date of the last follow -up visit for patients who 
are still alive and who have not progressed. The rationale for choosing PFS as the 
primary endpoint is that the response rate is generally low and any sur vival benefit is 
hard to document in second -line treatment of advanced NSCLC. In addition, the 2005 
consensus of the FDA’s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) was that PFS 
is a better predictor of clinical benefit than time to progression (TTP) becaus e PFS 
includes death as an outcome whereas TTP is based only on objective tumor 
progression [92]. 
 
Secondary objectives are to evaluate objective overall response rate [ORR, i.e., 
complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)],  disease control rate (CR+PR+SD), 
overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), duration of response, and toxicities 
in these  patients. OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of 
death due to any cause. Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from the 
date of randomization to the first date of documented disease progression.  
 
Response rates in each arm will be summarized by [CONTACT_13463] 95% confidence intervals. Time to event endpoints will be analyzed 
using standard survival analytic methods, including the Kaplan -Meier approach for 
estimating the survival distribution s. Median time to event and 95% confidence 
intervals will be estimated from the Kaplan -Meier curves. All primary and secondary 
analyses will be based on the intent -to-treat principle.  
 
11.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
We choose the patients with advanced NSCLC fo r a second -line therapy as study 
subjects. This is consistent with the current FDA label of the two drugs as single 
agents and supported by [CONTACT_13464] -resistant NSCLC cells are 
more dependent on EGFR signaling pathway for growth and su rvival.  
 
Patients will be randomized 2:1 to the combination versus single agent treatment 
groups to encourage accrual rate. The target sample size is 50 patients assigned to the 
combination therapy and 25 subjects to pemetrexed alone, for a total of 75 pa tients. 
To account for a ~10% dropout rate, 82 patients will be enrolled.  For the 
combination arm, the treatment would be considered worthy of further study if it 
increased the median PFS from approximately 3 months to 4.5 months.   For the 
purpose of eval uating the power of the study, we focus on the PFS rate at 6 months. 
Assuming an exponential distribution, a median PFS of 3 months corresponds to a 
PFS rate of 24% at 6 months of follow -up; a median PFS of 4.5 months corresponds 
to a PFS rate of 41% at [ADDRESS_12990] 80% power to 
 [ADDRESS_12991] an increase in the 6 month PFS survival rate from 24% to 41%, assuming a 
Type I error rate of 5%.   
 
An interi m analysis will be performed after the first 20 patients on the combination 
arm ha d been followed for a minimum of 3 months. If the upper limit of the 95% 
confidence interval for the 3 -month PFS rate is less than 50%, or equivalently, that 
we can conclude that the median PFS is less than [ADDRESS_12992] therapy arm is not to formally compare 
it with the combination arm, but rather to assess whether the observed efficacy in this 
study population is similar to the expected efficacy based on prior studies and also t o 
aid in the interpretation of the results on the combination arm. If the observed 6 
month PFS is equal to the expected value of 24%, then with a sample size of 25 
patients, the corresponding 95% CI will be 7.3% - 41%.  
 
The power of the study will be insu fficient to allow for a direct comparison between 
treatment arms; again, however, this is not the primary objective of the study. It is 
designed to obtain preliminary estimate of the clinical efficacy of pemetrexed 
followed by [CONTACT_13465] p atients. If the data from this randomized 
Phase II trial indicate that the combination arm may be efficacious, the results will be 
utilized to design a larger scale Phase III trial to formally compare the single agent 
and combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
The accru al period is assumed to be approximately 36 months (3 -4 patients/month), 
with a follow -up period of an additional [ADDRESS_12993] patient is enrolled.  
 
11.3 Randomization and Stratification   
 
Patients enrolled into the trial will be randomized 2: [ADDRESS_12994] provided by [CONTACT_4305]. Patients will be stratified by g ender, histology 
(adenocarcinoma versus others), performance status ( 0/1 versus 2), and prior smoking 
[≤15 versus >15 pack years (PY)].  
 
11.[ADDRESS_12995] received at lease one dose of 
treatment will be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol 
 45 treatment  deviations.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  
1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) 
early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death 
because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
[CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type 
of data in a clinical database.]  
 
Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered a s failing to respond to 
treatment (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  
Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol specific.

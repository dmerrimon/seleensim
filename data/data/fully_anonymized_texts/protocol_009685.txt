Study site(s) and number of subjects planned
Approximately [ADDRESS_1217254] and having a history of asthma exacerbations.
Approximately 770 subjects will be randomized globally.  Subjects will be stratified at 
randomization by [CONTACT_479965] (<16.44 ng/mL or ≥ 16.44 ng/mL) sampled during 
run-in, geographical region, and age group (adults versus adolescents). 
Subjects will receive either tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks via subcutaneous 
injection at the study site, over a 52-week treatment period.
After the initial enrolment and confirmation of the entry criteria, subjects will proceed to a 
run-in period of 4 to 6 weeks to allow adequate time for all of the eligibility criteria to be evaluated. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to a 52-week treatment period. Subjects will be maintained on their currently prescribed inhaled

without change, from enrolment throughout the run-in and treatment period.
Follow-up visits will be conducted at Weeks 56 and 72. The 20-week extended follow-up 
period is to ensure that adequate determination of immunogenicity can be determined.
Objectives
Primary Objective: Outcome Measures:
To evaluate the effect of tralokinumab 300 
mg administered every two weeks compared with placebo on the annualised asthma exacerbation rate in two populations:
Biomarker positive population: Subjects 
in the all subject population meeting the baseline criteria for biomarker positive population specified in the statistical analysis plan (primary population)
All subjects: Adult and adolescent 
subjects with asthma that is inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β
2-agonist (secondary 
population)Primary outcome variable: The annualised 
asthma exacerbation rate up to Week 52  
  Primary outcome measure: Asthma 
exacerbation rate reduction
An asthma exacerbation is defined by a 
worsening of asthma requiring:
!Use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 
days; a single depo-injectable dose of 
corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic corticosteroids
!An emergency room or urgent care visit 
(defined as evaluation and treatment for <24 
hours in an emergency room or urgent care center) due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids (as per the above)
!An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (defined as admission to an inpatient facility and/or evaluation and treatment in a healthcare facility for ≥24 hours) due to asthma

8(125)Statistical methods
The primary analysis of the efficacy endpoints will include all data captured during the double 
blind treatment period. The statistical analyses will compare tralokinumab to placebo in both populations. The biomarker positive population is not defined at the finalization of the clinical 
study protocol for this study, but will be defined based on results from study D2210C00007 
that is run in parallel before the unblinding of this study.
A hierarchical testing strategy will be applied for the confirmatory testing of primary and key 
secondary endpoints over the two populations to allow for control of type I error.
The primary efficacy objective will be evaluated through the null hypothesis test H0: rate ratio 
(tralokinumab/placebo) equals 1 vs. H1: rate ratio not equal to 1. The test will be based on a 
negative binomial model. Covariates and factors included in the model will include at least 
treatment and the stratifying variables. 
Key secondary outcome variables will be analyzed using a repeated measures analysis 
approach including at least treatment and stratifying variables as the explanatory variables. 
A total of [ADDRESS_1217262] years needed is based on an assumed 
annual exacerbation rate in the placebo group of 0.8, and shape parameter of 0.95 (over-dispersion) in both the all-subject and biomarker positive population. The calculations are 
made for a 1% significance level for all subjects and a 4% significance level for the biomarker 
positive population. The methodology used is described in Keene et al 2007. Assuming a uniform loss to follow-up of 15% during the study, [ADDRESS_1217263] 90% 
power for showing superiority with effects down to 37% asthma exacerbation reduction rate in the all-subject population. The proportion of subjects in the all-subject population falling 
within the biomarker positive subpopulation will depend on the biomarker positive criteria. 
Based on results from study D2210C00007, the testing strategy for this study has been revised to use a 5% significance level based on the biomarker positive population as the primary 
population, and it is estimated that approximately 20% to 35% of the studied subjects will 
fulfil the biomarker positive criteria. Using a 5% significance level for the biomarker positive population as the primary population, a true asthma exacerbation rate reduction of 50% would 
have a power between 70% and 90% to show superiority.
All safety parameters will be analyzed descriptively. The safety analyses will be based on the 
safety analysis data set, defined as all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_1217264].

20(125)1. INTRODUCTION
1.[ADDRESS_1217275] hyper-responsiveness, with a global prevalence of approximately 300 million 
patients ( GINA 2012 ). 
Approximately 5% to 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, many of whom may be 
inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_479966] (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) 
in combination with additional controller therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Bateman et al 2010 ). These patients are at 
risk of asthma exacerbations, have a large medical need, and represent the greatest economic burden ( Accordini et al 2006 ).
The observed variability in clinical response to currently available asthma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_291375], in part, to distinctive inflammatory phenotypes ( Wenzel 2012 ). There is 
considerable evidence that interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of 
asthmatic disease. IL-13 is secreted predominantly by [CONTACT_398]4+ T-helper 2 (Th2) cells and IL-13 
receptors are expressed on a number of cell types including those involved in the pathogenesis of asthma ( Hershey 2003 ). There is evidence to support that IL-[ADDRESS_1217276] hyper-responsiveness ( Wardlaw et al 1988 ), potentiate bronchoconstriction 
(Grunstein et al 2002 ), increase the number of mucus-secreting cells and promote airway 
fibrosis in asthma ( Wills-Karp et al 1998 ).
Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody (MAb) of the immunoglobulin 
G4 subclass that specifically binds human IL-13, blocking interactions with the IL-13 receptor. Tralokinumab is in development for the treatment of severe asthma. A phase 2a 
study (MI-CP199) provided evidence of improvement of lung function (forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_184849] 1 second (FEV
1)), following the addition of subcutaneous (SC) tralokinumab to 
standard asthma controller medications. Doses of 300 and 600 mg every 2 weeks of 
tralokinumab both resulted in comparable effects in FEV 1that were greater than that observed 
with a 150 mg dose ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_439730] 2013 ). Since low pre-bronchodilator (BD) FEV 1has been 
identified as a strong independent predictor of subsequent asthma exacerbations, it is plausible 
that the addition of tralokinumab will reduce the rate of asthma exacerbations in this population ( Reddel et al 2009 ). 
In a phase 2b (CD-RI-CAT-354-1049) study with tralokinumab in adults with uncontrolled, 
severe asthma requiring high dose ICS and LABA, the efficacy and safety of the 2 regimens (300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or, 300 mg Q2W for 12 weeks, followed by a 300 mg every 4 
weeks (Q4W) maintenance dosing [Q2/4W]) vs. placebo, was evaluated over a treatment 
period of 52 weeks. The primary endpoint for this study was the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks, with secondary endpoints including pulmonary 
function, patient reported outcomes, including asthma symptoms. In the overall intent-to-treat

21(125)phase 2b population, an increase from baseline in pre-BD FEV 1to the end of treatment was 
seen with the Q2W dosing regime, but not with the Q2/4W dosing regime. 
In this phase 2b study, a subpopulation reversible on entry (FEV 1reversibility ≥ 12% and 
≥200ml in FEV 1) an AAER reduction that was greater for the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W 
cohort versus the Q2/4W cohort was seen. A further reduction of AAER was observed in a 
subgroup of reversible subjects with high (> median) serum periostin, a biomarker induced by [CONTACT_8668]-13.  This is the population to be studied in phase 3. The safety profile of all doses studied 
so far has been acceptable (for further details see the investigators brochure (IB)).
The purpose of this phase [ADDRESS_1217277] in a biomarker (periostin or 
DPP4) positive target population, a population identified in a parallel phase 3 study (D2210C00007).
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
This is a global study designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the fixed dose 
tralokinumab (300mg) administered via SC injection every 2 weeks throughout a 52- week treatment period. Exacerbation-prone asthma subjects who remain uncontrolled on ICS-LABA, and who demonstrate a reversibility, ≥12% and ≥200 mL in FEV
1at either visit 2 
(run-in) or Visit 3 (randomization), will be randomized into the study. Primary efficacy will be determined based on reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations over 52 weeks for tralokinumab versus placebo. Subjects will be stratified at randomization by [CONTACT_479965] (<16.44 ng/mL or ≥ 16.44 ng/mL) sampled during the run-in, geographical 
region, and age group (adults versus adolescents). 
Previous efficacy studies of tralokinumab, including a phase 2b study with subjects on high 
dose ICS-LABA with or without additional asthma controller medications, have been conducted in adult subjects (18-75 years of age), and provide the basis for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 study. Pharmacokinetic evaluations in adolescents with asthma confirm that the same dose as for adults is applicable and since it is expected that adolescent subjects (12-17 years of age) will respond similarly to adults, and are therefore to be included as part of the study population. Adolescents will therefore be recruited in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] [ADDRESS_1217278], only limited, if any, improvement was observed with 150 mg Q2W (in study MI-CP199) or 300 mg Q2/4W (in study CD-RI-CAT-354-1049).  Furthermore, an effect on AAER was observed with the 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen, but not with the Q2/4W dosing regimen in study CD-RI-CAT-354-1049. Since the safety profile in the CD-RI-CAT-354-1049 study was acceptable in both treatment cohorts, and no clear safety related dose-response

22(125)pattern was identified, the dose of 300 mg Q2W has been selected for evaluation in this phase 
3 study. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling using all data obtained to date has 
also confirmed that a dose of [ADDRESS_1217279] population.
Subjects on placebo will receive maintenance therapy that includes their usual dose of ICS-
LABA (see section 7.7.2 ).
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
There are few treatment options for subjects whose asthma remains uncontrolled on ICS-
LABA ( GINA 2012 ). The evidence base for oral add-on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e. oral corticosteroids 
(OCS), leukotriene inhibitors (LTRAs), and xanthenes) is limited. Anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy (i.e., omalizumab) improves control in a subset of subjects with severe asthma 
associated with IgE-mediated allergy to a perennial allergen. Hence, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_479894].
IL-13 is targeted as it plays a role in the allergic/Th2 type response which is a signature [CONTACT_480017]. An anti-IL-13 treatment may therefore be useful in treatment of asthma. Data from 
phase 2 studies support this notion. Thus, in a 24-week phase 2a study (MI-CP199) tralokinumab at a dose of 300 mg SC every 2 weeks (the dose proposed for the phase 3 
programme) provided improvement of lung function (FEV
1), when added to standard asthma 
controller medications.  In addition the efficacy of tralokinumab has been studied in a 1 year long phase 2b study (CD-RI-CAT-354-1049) targeting adult subjects whose asthma was 
poorly controlled by [CONTACT_479967]-LABA. In this study, tralokinumab at a fixed dose of ≥ 
300 mg SC every other week produced improvements in multiple metrics of asthma control, including the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER), lung function, ACQ-[ADDRESS_1217280] helminthic parasitic infections, a theoretical risk for such infestations exists. IL-13 
may also play a role in regulating tumours ( Hallett et al 2012 ), and although evidence for this 
is scarce and inconclusive, this theoretical risk needs to be considered. In conjunction with the 
performance of routine pharmacovigilance activities risk minimization measures therefore 
include exclusion of subjects with untreated parasitic infection and active or recent malignancy.
As with all biologics therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], anti-drug antibodies (ADA), including neutralizing antibodies 
(nAb), may develop. Development of ADA to tralokinumab has been rare in the phase 1 and 2 
Revised Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D2210C00008

23(125)studies conducted thus far (<1% overall). Theoretical risks due to development of ADA 
include decreased drug efficacy and hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or immune 
complex disease) and observation following administration of tralokinumab is therefore mandated.
Pharmacokinetic modelling suggests that exposure to tralokinumab is slightly higher in 
adolescents (12-17 years of age) than that in adults; however, considering the overall variability of tralokinumab PK, and the absence of safety findings at doses at or above 300 mg 
every other week in the phase 2 studies, dose adjustment is not considered to be required for 
subjects in this age group. 
In summary, the efficacy and safety data obtained to date support the continued clinical 
development of tralokinumab in adult and adolescent subjects with uncontrolled asthma.
A detailed assessment of the risk/benefit of tralokinumab in subjects with asthma is given in 
the IB.
1.4 Study Design 
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of a fixed 300 mg dose of tralokinumab administered SC in subjects with uncontrolled asthma receiving ICS ( ≥500μg fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_479895]) and a LABA, and having a history of asthma exacerbations.
Subjects will receive either tralokinumab 300 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks via subcutaneous 
injection at the study site, over a 52-week treatment period.
Approximately 770 subjects will be randomized at approximately 310 sites globally. Subjects 
will be stratified at randomization by [CONTACT_479965] (< 16.44 ng/mL or ≥ 16.44 ng/mL), 
sampled during run-in, geographical region, and age group (i.e. adults versus adolescents). 
After initial enrolment and confirmation of entry criteria, subjects will enter a run-in period of 
[ADDRESS_1217281] dose of tralokinumab/placebo will be administered at Week 0. Subsequent doses will be administered every 2 weeks up until Week 50 (for a total of 26 doses) with an end of treatment (EOT) visit occurring at Week 52.  Subjects will be maintained on their currently prescribed ICS-LABA and any additional maintenance asthma controller medications, without 
change, from enrolment throughout the run-in and treatment period. All subjects will have 
site visits every 2 weeks.  
Follow-up visits will be conducted at Weeks 56 and 72. The extended follow-up period is to 
ensure that adequate determination of immunogenicity can be determined.

3. SUBJECT SELECTION, ENROLMENT, RANDOMIZATION, 
RESTRICTIONS, DISCONTINUATION AND WITHDRAWAL 
Each subject should meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for this 
study.  Under no circumstances can there be exceptions to this rule.
3.1 Inclusion criteria
For inclusion in the study, subjects should fulfil the following criteria:
1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures for subjects 
who are at, or over the age of majority (as per local law). For subjects less than the 
age of majority, in addition to the subject providing informed assent, the subject’s legal guardian must also provide their informed consent.
2. Female and male aged from 12 to 75 years, inclusively at time of enrolment (Visit 
1).  For those countries where local regulations permit enrolment of adults only, subject recruitment will be restricted to those who are ≥18 years.
3. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) (after menarche) and all adolescent 
females must use a highly effective form of birth control (confirmed by [CONTACT_093]). Highly effective forms of birth control includes: true sexual 
abstinence, a vasectomised sexual partner, Implanon, female sterilization by [CONTACT_479969], any effective intrauterine device/system (IUD/IUS), Depo-Provera™ injections, oral contraceptive, and Evra Patch ™ or Nuvaring™. WOCBP must 
agree to use highly effective method of birth control, as defined above, from 
enrolment, throughout the study duration and within [ADDRESS_1217285] (IP), and have negative serum pregnancy test result at Visit 
1.
Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either 
permanently sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]), or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered 
postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months prior to the planned

specific requirements apply:
!Women <[ADDRESS_1217286] 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous 
hormonal treatment and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the 
postmenopausal range.
!Women ≥[ADDRESS_1217287] 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all 
exogenous hormonal treatment.
4. Weight of ≥40 and <150 kg at enrolment (Visit 1).  
5. Documented physician-diagnosed asthma for at least [ADDRESS_1217288] 6 of the 12 months prior to enrolment 
(Visit 1). In addition, subjects must have used physician prescribed ICS (at a total 
daily dose ≥ 500μg fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_479896]) that has been taken at a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to 
enrolment. 
6. Documented treatment with ICS at a total daily dose corresponding to ≥500μg 
fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_479897] a LABA for at least 
[ADDRESS_1217289] strength approved maintenance dose in the local country will meet this 
ICS criterion.
!In order to aid the assessment, ICS equivalents for high-dose and medium-
dose fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_479898], as published by [CONTACT_871556] ( GINA 2012 ) guidelines, are presented in Appendix F. 
The Investigator will assess the subject’s total daily ICS dose and determine 
that it corresponds to ≥500μg fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_871537]. If the subject is on two or more different types of ICS, these can 
form parts of an addition, and the sum, however approximate, will be 
assessed.
The below defines the minimally acceptable documentation for subject inclusion:
1. Signed and dated notes from a referring physician, including name [CONTACT_480018]-LABA inhaler (or names and dosages, if used as separate inhalers).  
2. Evidence of prescriptions for ICS-LABA medications that demonstrate 
coverage for the duration specified in inclusion criteria 6 and 7.

32(125)3. Documented communication (e.g.: phone conversation) clarifying that the 
subject received treatment with ICS-LABA for asthma.  The name, dosage, 
and duration of use for each medication must be recorded.  This option should be used only if reasonable attempts to procure subject records have 
been unsuccessful.
7. Additional maintenance asthma controller medications are allowed according to 
standard practice of care.  These medications must be stable for 3 months prior to 
enrolment (Visit 1).  Furthermore, after randomization, the subject's background 
maintenance medication for asthma shall remain unchanged throughout the study.
8. At Visit [ADDRESS_1217290] a morning pre-BD FEV
1value <80% (<90% for 
subjects 12 to 17 years of age) of their predicted normal value (PNV). At Visit [ADDRESS_1217291] a morning pre-BD FEV 1 value of ≥40 and <80% value (<90% for 
subjects 12 to 17 years of age) of their PNV.  If this is not met at Visit 2, it must be 
met at Visit 3. Prior to the lung function measurement, the subject should withhold 
their BD for the effect duration specific to the BD.
9. A post-BD reversibility in FEV 1of ≥12% and ≥[ADDRESS_1217292] be met at Visit 3 (randomization). Before reversibility testing, the subject 
should withhold their BD for the effect duration specific to the BD.
10. At least 2 documented asthma exacerbations in the 12 months prior to the date 
informed consent is obtained that required use of a systemic corticosteroid. In case 
of subjects who are re-screened within 30 days of their screen failure date; the [ADDRESS_1217293] informed consent was obtained.
The below defines what is acceptable to document exacerbations in this Program:
1. Discharge summaries from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], emergency department, or an urgent care 
facility indicating that a subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]/treated with systemic steroids 
for an asthma exacerbation.  
2. Signed and dated notes from a referring physician, including information 
regarding diagnosis and treatment of an exacerbation with systemic steroids.  
3. Subjects can provide evidence of prescriptions for systemic steroids used during 
an exacerbation.  
4. A documented conversation between the treating/referral physician or 
nurse/nurse practitioner certifying that a subject was treated for an exacerbation 
with steroids at their clinic or under their supervision.  The dates (month/year) of the exacerbations and verbal confirmation that appropriate prescriptions were 
provided is necessary.  This option should be used only if reasonable attempts to 
procure subject records have been unsuccessful.

33(125)A combination of the above is acceptable to document the two required exacerbations. 
However, it is necessary for the Investigator to document how they obtained confirmation 
of the subject’s asthma exacerbations.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure 
subject eligibility into the clinical study.  In cases where the Investigator feels that alternative records to the above constitutes acceptable documentation, the Study 
Physician will be contact[CONTACT_479971].  Every 
attempt should be made to obtain appropriate source documentation of medical records.

Investigator(s) should keep a record (i.e., a subject screening log) of subjects who entered pre-
study screening. The pre-screening/screening log will be evaluated periodically by [CONTACT_230604]/or its delegates during routine monitoring visits.
The Investigator(s) will:
1. Obtain signed informed consent or assent from the potential subject, or their 
guardian/legal representative, before any study specific procedures are performed.
2. Assign the potential subject a unique enrolment number (which begins with an ‘E’).
3. Determine subject eligibility. See Section 3.
4. Assign the eligible subject unique randomization code via the Interactive Web 
Response System/ Interactive Voice Response System (IWRS/IVRS).
5. Subjects will be allocated to receive tralokinumab or placebo 1:1 ratio (i.e. 385 
subjects on active vs. 385 subjects on placebo).  Randomization numbers will be 
grouped in blocks.  Randomized subjects who discontinue will not be replaced. If a 
subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/ randomization code cannot be reused.
Specific information concerning the use of the IWRS/IVRS will be provided in a separate 
instruction manual.

39(125)involved in the management of study subjects, or needs to be known to treat an individual 
subject for an AE, the sponsor must be notified immediately by [CONTACT_479976], before unblinding. 
All packaging and labelling of IP will be done in such way as to ensure blinding for all 
sponsor and investigational site staff (other than the unblinded IP manager who will directly 
handle the pre-filled syringes).
The following personnel will have access to the randomization list:
!those carrying out the packaging and labelling of IP
!those generating the randomization list
The information in the randomization list will be kept from other personnel involved in the 
conduct of the study, and in a secure location until the end of the study.
No member of the extended study team at [COMPANY_008], or any CRO handling data, will have 
access to the randomization scheme during the conduct of the study, with the exception of the 
Supply Chain Study Management department and the Patient Safety department at 
[COMPANY_008] and personnel at the bioanalytical lab performing the PK sample analysis.
A DSMB will review safety data by [CONTACT_479977]. The DSMB will have access to the individual treatment codes and will be able to merge 
these with the collected study data while the study is ongoing (see Section 0), if and as 
required. The personnel involved in the clinical study at [COMPANY_008] will remain blinded to 
these analyses and will have no knowledge of the results presented to the DSMB.

IVRS/IWRS. Routines for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be 
provided to each site.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment randomization. The 
Investigator documents and reports the action to [COMPANY_008], without revealing the treatment given to subject to the [COMPANY_008] staff.
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data 
until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual subject have been made 
and documented.

a) Fertile and sexually active female subjects (including adolescent females) should use 
highly effective contraceptive methods throughout the study and at least for 16 weeks 
(5 half-lives) after last administration of the IP. 
b) Subjects must abstain from donating blood, plasma from the time of informed 
consent or assent and for 16 weeks (5 half-lives) after last dose of IP.
3.[ADDRESS_1217302]
At any time, subjects are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study (i.e., IP and 
assessments – see Section 3.10), without prejudice to further treatment.  A subject that decides 
to discontinue the IP will always be asked about the reason(s) for their decision to withdraw 
and the presence of any AEs.  If possible, they will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_39595](s).  
Adverse events will be followed up (as described in Section 6). The enrolment/randomization 
code of the withdrawn subject cannot be reused.
3.9.[ADDRESS_1217303] 
Subjects will be discontinued from IP in the following situations:
1. Subject decision.  The subject is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment
2. The subject experiences an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], contraindicates 
further dosing
3. The development of any risk to the subject as judged by [CONTACT_871558] 
4. Severe non-compliance with the study protocol
5. Pregnancy 6. Lost to follow-up

8. Development of one or more of the following:
a. Confirmed ALT or AST increase of ≥[ADDRESS_1217304] increase of ≥[ADDRESS_1217305] increase of ≥[ADDRESS_1217306] and total bilirubin of ≥[ADDRESS_1217307] of ≥[ADDRESS_1217308] with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia ( ≥5%)
Subjects who discontinue IP or the study will always be asked about the reason(s) for 
discontinuation and the presence of any AEs. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_479901](s), test(s) and evaluation(s) as well as give appropriate medication and all 
possible measures for the safety of the subject. They will also immediately inform [COMPANY_008] of the withdrawal. Adverse events will be followed up (see Section 6) and any 
questionnaires (e.g., for patient reported outcomes) are to be completed.
Discontinuation of IP does not necessarily mean discontinuation of follow-up or termination 
of study participation. Compliant subjects who are discontinued from the IP should be 
encouraged to continue to undergo all study related visits/procedures for the full 52-week 
study period in order to support the final efficacy and safety analysis for tralokinumab (see section 8). The reason for premature discontinuation of IP will be documented in the source 
documentation and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
It is essential to collect as much data as possible for all subjects throughout the study and 
especially all potential endpoint events. Complete withdrawal from the study (i.e., withdrawal 
of consent) has a direct negative impact on the potential validity of all study data and should 
be avoided wherever possible.
If the subject permanently discontinues IP prior to their completion of the study and wishes to 
continue with the study assessments, they may choose from [ADDRESS_1217309] the reason for study withdrawal 
recorded as ‘Incorrect Enrolment’ (i.e., subject does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion

42(125)criteria).  This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures, and not 
randomized subjects.
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent or assent
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time (i.e., from receiving IP and/or having 
assessments performed), without prejudice to further treatment.
A subject who withdraws their consent or assent will always be asked about the reason(s) for 
their decision to withdrawal, and the presence of any AE.  The Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study. The subject must return the ePRO and ePEF devices.  
If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomization 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 
If the subject only withdraws consent for the retention of blood samples for future exploratory 
use (e.g., DNA, study of markers of asthma, identifying potential new drug targets for asthma, 
or for assay development purposes), the subject will not be withdrawn from the study.
Withdrawal of consent from the study must be ascertained and documented by [CONTACT_479979] (ICF) or assent form. The 
ICF or assent form must be re-signed and dated by [CONTACT_871559] (CAT-354)

50(125)4.1 Enrolment/run-in period
4.1.1 Enrolment (Visit 1)
Each potential subject who is at, or over the age of majority (as per local law) will provide 
informed consent prior to the start of any study specific procedures and undergo assessments applicable for this visit (see Table 1 ).
For subjects less than the age of majority, in addition to the subject providing informed assent, 
the subject’s legal guardian must also provide their informed consent.
With the exception of documentation of informed consent and assent (if applicable), which 
can be completed up to [ADDRESS_1217314] had their BD
medications withheld in accordance with the spi[INVESTIGATOR_479906] (see section 5.1.2 ).The 
registration of the subject’s enrollment via IWRS/IVRS should occur on the day when the Visit [ADDRESS_1217315]’s eligibility 
(inclusion/exclusion) criteria, including their asthma disease state, the requisite level of severity based on maintenance medications, exacerbation history, and the current level of 
control based on an initial ACQ-[ADDRESS_1217316] a pre-BD FEV
1value <80% 
of their PNV (<90% for subjects 12 to 17 years of age) in order to proceed in the study (as per 
Section 3.1, criterion 8).  If not, the subject will be screen failed.
Other study assessments and procedures to be performed at this visit include the recording of 
the subject’s demographics, a complete physical examination (including height and weight), 
vital signs, a dECG, recording the subject’s medical/surgical history and concomitant 
medications, collection of blood samples for haematology/clinical chemistry, serology and biomarkers, collection of a urine sample for urinalysis, and a pregnancy test for WOCBP.
A record of physician-diagnosed asthma, ICS-LABA use, use of other asthma controllers 
(Section 3.1, criteria  5, 6and 7) and asthma exacerbations over the prior year (Section 3.1, 
criterion 10) is required for source documentation. A subject’s verbal history suggestive of 
asthma symptoms and/or prior asthma exacerbations, but without supporting documentation, 
is notsufficient to satisfy these inclusion criteria.
4.1.2 Run-in (Visit 2)
The run-in period (i.e., from Visit 1 to Visit 3) is 4 to 6 weeks (with a 3 day window) in 
duration. The subject should remain on their current asthma treatment with no changes

Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)  
Study Code D2210C00008
Edition Number 4.0
Date 09 June 2017
51(125)throughout the entire run-in period. Assessments applicable for the run-in period are listed in
Table [ADDRESS_1217317] AE and concomitant medication information, as well as a 
blood sample for periostin (to be used for stratification at randomization).  
The protocol specified reversibility criterion (i.e. inclusion criterion 9) will be assessed at this 
visit.  Should this criterion not be met at Visit 2, subjects must fulfill it at Visit [ADDRESS_1217318] will be supplied with an electronic hand-held spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (peak flow meter) to 
measure the subject’s PEF at home, and an ePRO device to record asthma symptoms and complete relevant questionnaires (see section 5.2.2 for further details).
Visit 2 may be performed as a telephone visit (for collection of SAE information only) if the 
subject is confirmed as ineligible for the study (e.g., based on laboratory results from Visit 1, or medical history).
The subject’s eligibility should be evaluated at each visit during the run-in period with the relevant documentation entered in the source and eCRF.
4.1.3 Randomization (Visit 3)
Lung function with measurement of morning pre-dose, pre-BD and post-BD FEV1 will be 
performed on Visit [ADDRESS_1217319] a morning pre-BD FEV
1 of 
≥40% and <80% (<90% for subjects 12 to 17 years of age) of the subject’s PNV, and fulfil the 
protocol-specified reversibility criterion ( ≥12% FEV 1 and ≥200 mL), if either is not met at 
Visit 2. Other inclusion criteria at randomization will be confirmed at Visit 3. Before randomization the subject’s compliance with their usual asthma controller (ICS-LABA), and any other asthma controller medication, and ePRO completion must be confirmed (see section 3.1, inclusion criteria 18and 19). The subject should bring the ePRO device to this visit where
they will complete the ACQ-6, AQLQ(S)+12, EQ-5D-5L, and the WPAI + CIQ.
If the periostin value measured at Visit 2 is missing at randomization (Visit 3), the subject 
should not be randomized, nor should any Visit 3 assessments be performed. A new blood sample for periostin should be taken at this visit and a new Visit 3 visit should be re-scheduled to occur 2 weeks later, along with all other Visit 3 assessments.  
4.1.4 Re-screening
Subjects who experience an asthma exacerbation within 30 days prior to ICF date or during 
the screening/run-in phase should be screen failed.  They may be re-screened no sooner than 
[ADDRESS_1217320] dose of systemic steroids.

Date 09 June 2017
52(125)Subjects with respi[INVESTIGATOR_479907] 30 
days prior to the date informed consent is obtained or during the screening/run-in period may 
also be re-screened.
Re-screening for the above mentioned reasons is allowed only once for the subject. Subjects 
should be re-screened no later than 3 months failing initial enrolment.
If the reason for screen failure was transient (including but not limited to study-supplied 
equipment failure and unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening visits), 
subjects may potentially be re-screened. These cases should be discussed with the 
[COMPANY_008] Study Physician and documented approval for re-screening should be filed in the Investigator Study File (ISF).
Re-screening for subjects who have screen-failed due to an ACQ score <1.[ADDRESS_1217321] will be re-enrolled and reassigned their originally assigned enrolment 
number after signing a new Informed Consent Form (ICF), or assent form, and after all run-in 
assessments have been performed as listed in Table 1 (with the exception of testing for HIV1 
an HIV2, hepatitis B and C, and FSH). Re-enrolment is only allowed once for any subject, 
regardless of whether this is due to an exacerbation or infection. The subject may not be re-
screened if any other eligibility criteria are failed.
4.[ADDRESS_1217322]’s compliance with their usual asthma controller ICS-LABA and other asthma 
controller medication, and ePRO completion must be confirmed (see section 3.1, inclusion 
criteria 18and 19).
Subjects confirmed as eligible will be randomized at Visit 3 (Week 0) in a 1:1 ratio (i.e. 385 
subjects on tralokinumab, and 385 subjects on placebo). Subjects will be administered tralokinumab 300mg or placebo via subcutaneous injection at the study site Q2W for a total of 
[ADDRESS_1217323] dose of the IP will be administered following randomization through IWRS/IVRS at 
Visit 3.
Following randomization the subject will receive [ADDRESS_1217324] dose of tralokinumab/placebo administered at Visit 28 (Week 50).
Subjects will have scheduled visits at 2-week intervals to complete protocol-specific 
assessments and IP administration, as listed in Table 1 . Restrictions as set out in section 7.7.2
will continue to apply throughout the treatment period. In case of an asthma worsening/exacerbation (see section 5.1.1 ), subjects should be evaluated at the study site,

Study Code D2210C00008
Edition Number 4.0
Date 09 June 2017
53(125)when feasible, at an unscheduled visit, or ordinary visit if the worsening happens to fall within 
a scheduled visit window.
Subjects will continue to measure their PEF at home, as well as record asthma symptoms and 
responses to questionnaires in the Asthma Daily Diary throughout the 52-week treatment 
period (see section 5.2.2 for details).
Subjects will have brief physical exams performed at times listed in Table 1 .  A complete 
physical exam will be performed at Visit 29 (Week 52). 
Additional blood samples will be obtained from the subjects at Visits 3, 9, [ADDRESS_1217325]’s adherence for completing all questionnaires in the ePRO will be assessed at all 
visits during the treatment period, with retraining provided as required.
At Week 52 subjects will come to the site for the End of Treatment (EOT) visit.  The subject 
should bring the ePRO device to the EOT visit and complete the ACQ-6, AQLQ(S)+12, EQ-5D-5L, and the WPAI + CIQ, unless they have been completed at home prior to the visit.
The final follow up visits (i.e., 30 and 31) are to occur 4 weeks (+7 days) and 20 weeks (+7 
days) from the date of the EOT visit, respectively.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue IP (see section 3.9) should return to the study site and 
complete procedures described for the IP Discontinuation Visit (IPD visit), see Table [ADDRESS_1217326] will be given three options as to how they will be 
followed up:
1. Ideally, the subject should return for all regular clinic visits and perform all 
scheduled assessments until he/she completes a total of [ADDRESS_1217327].
For each option, an EOT visit will be conducted.
For option 1, all procedures will be done at each visit as indicated in Table 1.  For options 2 
and 3, AEs/SAEs, changes in concomitant medications and asthma exacerbation information 
are the minimum elements that must be collected at each contact.

54(125)The subject’s decision needs to be documented in the eCRF and the specific section in the 
ICF/assent form addendum needs to be signed by [CONTACT_423].
Should the subject choose option [ADDRESS_1217328] chooses option 1, 
they will complete the IP Discontinuation visit immediately and then the EOT visit at week 
52.  The EOT visit/call will be completed immediately in the case of early withdrawal from option 1 or 2.
Subjects who initially chose options 1 or 2 and subsequently cannot or do not wish to comply 
with the requirements of the chosen option, can choose to continue with a less invasive option (i.e.: Subject initially choosing option 1 can continue with 2 or 3, subjects initially choosing 
option 2 can continue with 3).
Subjects who do not wish to have any follow up contacts at all, will be discontinued from the 
study. All discontinued subjects must return the ePRO and ePEF devices at the EOT visit.
Completion, or early termination of IP treatment, will be registered via the IWRS/IVRS for 
each subject.
4.[ADDRESS_1217329] follow-up visits (30 and 31) at Weeks [ADDRESS_1217330] Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and 
query handling. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on eCRFs as specified in 
the study protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided.
The investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded 
and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement. 
The investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site upon completion of the study.
5.1 Efficacy assessments
5.1.1 Assessment of asthma exacerbations
For the purpose of the protocol, an asthma exacerbation will be defined as a worsening of 
asthma that leads to any of the following:
!Use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days; a single depo-injectable dose of 
corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic 
corticosteroids
Revised Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)  
Study Code D2210C00008
Edition Number 4.0
Date 09 June 2017
55(125)!An ER or urgent care visit (defined as evaluation and treatment for <24 hours in an 
ED or urgent care center) due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids (as 
per above)
!An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (defined as admission to an inpatient facility and/or 
evaluation and treatment in a healthcare facility for ≥24 hours) due to asthma 
The ePRO device will be programmed to alert both the subject and study site when certain 
pre-specified worsening thresholds are crossed as follows: 
!Decrease in morning peak flow ≥30% on at least 2 of 3 successive days compared 
with baseline (last 10 days of run-in), and/or 
!A ≥ 50% increase in rescue medication or one new or additional nebulized β2-
agonist on at least 2 of 3 successive days compared with the average use for the previous week, and/or 
!Nocturnal awakening due to asthma requiring rescue medication use for at least 2 
of 3 successive nights, and/or; 
!An increase in total asthma symptom score (the sum of day time [evening 
assessment] and night-time [morning assessment] of at least 2 units above the run-
in average (last 10 days of run-in), or the highest possible score (daily score of 6), on at least 2 of 3 successive days.
For the purpose of the protocol, worsening of asthma is defined as new or increased symptoms 
and/or signs (i.e., physical examination or lung function) that can be either concerning to the 
subject (subject-driven) or related to an Asthma Daily Diary alert (diary-driven).
If an exacerbation event is not associated with deterioration in at least one of the pre-specified 
subject-driven and/or diary-driven objective measurements, the Investigator will have to 
justify the decision for defining the event as an exacerbation. Events that are not supported by 
[CONTACT_479981] a protocol-defined exacerbation.
In order to calculate the number of exacerbations experienced by a subject during the 52-week 
treatment period, the following rule will be applied: 
!The start of an exacerbation is defined as the start date of systemic corticosteroids, 
ER or urgent care visit requiring systemic corticosteroids, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871542], whichever occurs earlier, and the end date is defined as the last day of 
systemic corticosteroids or ER or urgent care visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], whichever 
occurs later. 
Additional systemic corticosteroid treatments, ER or urgent care visits requiring use of 
systemic corticosteroids, or inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871543] a new exacerbation. In order to be counted as a new 
exacerbation it must be preceded by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1217331] to do so.

Drug Substance Tralokinumab (CAT-354)  
Study Code D2210C00008

Date 09 June 2017
56(125)Reasonable attempts should be made by [CONTACT_871560] a diary alert or subject initiated asthma worsening, particularly when it 
results in additional treatment being prescribed. Study site evaluations for asthma worsening may occur as an unscheduled visit or as part of an ordinary site visit if the worsening happens 
to be coincident with a scheduled visit window. 
A copy of the medical record should be obtained for exacerbations evaluated and treated at 
non-study sites (e.g., by [CONTACT_871561]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and details entered into 
the exacerbation eCRF module in a timely fashion. Changes in concomitant medication due to 
exacerbation must be recorded in the appropriate module of the eCRF.
Maximum follow-up time for a subject is approximately 52 weeks; defined as the time from 
randomization (Visit 3) to the date of Visit 29. For a subject lost to follow-up, this will be 
defined as the time from randomization to the time point after which an exacerbation could not be assessed (i.e., the last contact [CONTACT_568]). 
Exacerbations that occur after a subject has discontinued IP should still be accounted for when 
deriving the total number of exacerbations; and likewise, the follow-up time will reflect the follow-up time regardless of whether or not the subject is still on IP.

particularly critical for efficacy measures taken during the treatment period, but should also facilitate meeting the run-in FEV
1and reversibility eligibility criteria.
Options for handling subjects who have inadvertently taken their asthma medication within 
the restricted window are described in section 7.7.[ADDRESS_1217334] 2 hours prior to spi[INVESTIGATOR_479916]. All spi[INVESTIGATOR_479917] (irrespective of whether to obtain values for FEV
1, FVC, FEF 25-75%) should be performed with the subject seated in an 
upright position. If this is not comfortable for the subject, standing is permitted. The same position should be used by [CONTACT_479983][INVESTIGATOR_479918]. The head must not be tilted during manoeuvres and the thorax should be able to move freely; hence tight clothing should be loosened. A nose-clip should be used for the manoeuvre.

complete exhalation.  The subject should inhale rapi[INVESTIGATOR_479921].  It is important that the preceding inspi[INVESTIGATOR_479922] (i.e. only for 1-2 seconds).  The subject should be prompted to “blast”, not just “blow”, and they should be encouraged to fully exhale until the end of test criteria are met.  If the patient feels dizzy, the manoeuvre should be stopped, since syncope could follow due to prolonged interruption of venous return to the thorax.  Manoeuvres that do not meet the end of test criteria should not be used to satisfy the requirement of three acceptable manoeuvres.  However early termination, by [CONTACT_5071], is not a reason to eliminate all the results from such a manoeuvre from further consideration.  
To allow recording of the FVC value, it is important that the whole manoeuvre lasts for at 
least 6 seconds. Ensure that none of the following has occurred: coughing during the first second, glottis closure, leak or obstruction of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (by [CONTACT_243285]).
Multiple forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_91401] (at least 3 but no more than 8) will be performed for each 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_406767].  There should be at least 3 efforts that meet ATS/ERS acceptability criteria with the highest value and second highest value for FEV1 and FVC meeting the ATS/ERS reproducibility criteria.  The largest FVC and the largest FEV1 should be recorded after examining the data from all of the usable curves, even if they do not come from the same curve.  If the criteria for acceptability and reproducibility are not met with the first 3

reproducibility criteria is not fulfilled after the maximum number of manoeuvres has been performed, the highest of the FEV1 and FVC value that is deemed acceptable should be selected.   The absolute measurement (for FEV
1), and the percentage of PNV (Quanjer et al 
2012) will be recorded. 
The mean forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_66753] 25% and 75% of the FVC (FEF25–75%) is taken 
from the blow with the largest sum of FEV1 and FVC. The FEF25–75% must be measured with an accuracy of at least +5% of reading or +0.[ADDRESS_1217335]´s usual asthma controller medication, BD and IP 
dose, should be withheld until after the final post-BD spi[INVESTIGATOR_871546]. 
Record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]
A signed and dated copy of the pre- and post- BD printout must be kept at the study site for 
source data verification. The printout must be marked with the study code, subject enrolment 
code, date and time of measurement, and visit number.
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_291413] (GLI) equations will be used to determine the subjects 
PNVs and are pre-programmed into the spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] ( Quanjer et al 2012 ).

[IP_ADDRESS] Reversibility test and post-BD FEV 1efficacy assessment
The initial (pre-BD) FEV1 measurement (Section 5.1.2) must be completed before 
commencing the post-BD assessment.  
As before, ensure that the subject has withheld each of their theophylline and BD medications 
for the minimum period of time specified in Section 7.7.[ADDRESS_1217336] did 
not withhold their medications as specified, the reversibility assessment should be re-scheduled within the next 7 days; other visit assessments may be completed as planned.  
Albuterol 90 μg metered dose or Salbutamol 100 μg metered dose will be used in the 
reversibility assessment.  Up to 8 doses may be administered at Visit 2 and Visit 3, and up to 4 doses at the other visits (Visit 7, Visit 29 (EOT) and/or IP Discontinuation Visit). The dose 
should be adjusted if there is any concern about the effect on the subject’s heart rate, tremor or 
any other safety parameter during the assessment; the reason should be noted in the subject’s medical records.

59(125)A spacer device should be used for administration of the SABA; nebulizers should not be 
used.  The same bronchodilator and type of device should be used at each visit where 
reversibility is assessed. 
Step 1: FEV1 measurement after 4 SABA inhalations  
For administration of albuterol/salbutamol, the subject will:
(i) Perform a gentle, complete expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (ii) Inhale Dose [ADDRESS_1217337] exhales.
(iii) Rest for approximately 30 seconds before the next dose(iv) Repeat this for Dose 2, Dose 3 and Dose 4, resting for a further 15 – 20 minutes after 
Dose 4  
After resting for 15 – 20 minutes, proceed to measure FEV1 following the technique described 
in Section 5.1.2
Visit 2 and Visit 3:  if the inclusion criterion for reversibility is met ( ≥12% and ≥200 mL) this 
is the end of the reversibility assessment.  If it is not met the subject proceeds to Step 2.
Visit 7, Visit 29/EOT and/or IP Discontinuation Visit:  this is the end of the reversibility 
assessment.
Step 2: FEV1 measurement following a further 2 (total of 6) SABA inhalations (Only at 
Visit 2 and Visit 3, if assessed)
The subject will repeat the SABA inhalation procedures for Dose 5 and Dose 6.  (See Step 1 
above for instructions.)
After resting for 15 – 20 minutes FEV1 will be measured following the technique described in 
Section 5.1.2.  
This is the end of the reversibility assessment if either of the following occurs: • the inclusion criterion for reversibility is met ( ≥12% and ≥200 mL) or 
• the incremental change in FEV1 between Step 1 and 2 is ≤5% and the inclusion 
criterion is not met 
Subjects proceed to Step 3 if the incremental change in FEV1 between Step 1 and Step 2 is 
>5% and if the criterion for reversibility has not yet been met.

60(125)Step 3: FEV1 measurement following a further 2 (total of 8) SABA inhalations (Only at 
Visit 2, and Visit 3 if assessed)
The subject will repeat the inhalation procedures for Dose 7 and Dose 8, resting for 15 – 20 
minutes after Dose 8. (See Step 1 above for instructions).
After resting for 15 – 20 minutes, proceed to measure FEV1 following the technique described 
in Section 5.1.2. The reversibility assessment is now complete.
For subjects who need to perform step 2 and/or step [ADDRESS_1217338]-BD outcome variable in FEV1 will be derived from the 
value obtained after step 1.
5.1.3 Home PEF testing
An electronic, hand-held spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (peak flow meter) will be dispensed to the subject at Visit 
2. Home PEF testing will be performed by [CONTACT_479984] (and 
prior to taking their AM asthma controller) and in the evening at bedtime (and prior to taking their PM asthma controller). Recording of home PEF should start from the evening of Visit 2 
(Week -2) until the morning of Visit 29 (Week 52) using an ePEF meter device. When 
possible, ambulatory lung function measurements should be taken at least [ADDRESS_1217339] dose of SABA rescue medication.
Subjects should perform 3 successive peak flow manoeuvres while sitting or standing, but in 
the same position at every testing; the highest of the 3 values will be captured for the morning and for the evening manoeuvres.
The investigator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to correct use of the peak 
flow meter at each visit as shown in Table 1 (or on EOT visit if prematurely discontinued 
from the study).
5.1.4 Periostin
An investigational use only (IUO)/performance evaluation only (PEO) assay is being 
specifically developed and validated as a companion diagnostic for tralokinumab to address the potential identification of a target population with an enhanced response rate based on the 
presence of high serum periostin as an indicator of IL-[ADDRESS_1217340] assessment with regards to periostin baseline level at Visit 2, will be used for stratification purposes.  Analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_11378].  Blood samples will also be obtained at Visits 3, 9, 16, and 29. These samples may 
be used in existing and/or future clinical studies of in vitro diagnostic assays.

[IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6)
The ACQ-6 is a shortened version of the ACQ that assesses asthma symptoms (night-time 
waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing, and short-
acting β
2-agonist use) omitting the FEV 1measurement from the original ACQ score.
Subjects will be asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by 
[CONTACT_20230] 1 question regarding their BD use, and 5 questions pertaining to their asthma 
symptoms.
Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely 
uncontrolled). The mean ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤ 0.75 
indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and ≤1.5 indicate partly controlled 
asthma, and a score >1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma ( Juniper et al 2006 ). Individual 
changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.
The questionnaire will be completed using the ePRO device.Visit 1 ACQ-6 scores will determine eligibility for run-in and randomization (see section 3.1

At Visit 1, Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU) information will be collected with a ‘one 
year’ recall period. All the subsequent visits will collect HRU information with a recall period of ‘since the last scheduled visit’.
Note : cases of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406770] (as described in sections 6.2
and 6.4). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical – Global Impression of Change (CGIC) assessment
The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) instrument is used to evaluate the overall 
response to treatment.  The investigator (clinician) will be asked to rate the degree to which 
the overall asthma status may have changed when compared to baseline (i.e. randomization visit/initiation of study drug).  The assessment uses a 7-point rating scale: 1 = Very Much 
Improved; 2 = Much Improved; 3 = Minimally Improved; 4 = No Change; 5 = Minimally 
Worse; 6 = Much Worse; and 7 = Very Much Worse.
The CGIC will be completed at the site visits as indicated in Table 1. It is recommended that 
the same clinician completes the CGIC at all applicable visits for an individual subject. Before

6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153188].
6.[ADDRESS_1217363].  An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal 
results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical studies, an 
AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run-in, treatment, washout, follow-
up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
!Results in death
!Is immediately life-threatening

The following variables will be collected in the eCRF for each AE:
!AE (verbatim)
!The date when the AE started and stopped
!Maximum intensity* of the AE
!Whether the AE is serious or not
!Investigator causality rating against the Investigational Product (yes or no)
!Action taken with regard to IP
!AE caused subject’s withdrawal from study (yes or no )
!Outcome

!Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)
!Description of the AE
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.

Adverse Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship 
is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is provided in Appendix B to the 
Clinical Study Protocol.

symptom will be recorded separately.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the 
CSR.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values and vital 
signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the 
reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP.
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting Investigator will use the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobin 
value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation, 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix E for further instruction on cases of increases 
in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.
6.3.[ADDRESS_1217368] tightness, dyspnoea, breathlessness 
and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs when:
!the sign or symptom is serious according to definitions, see Section 6.2,
!the subject discontinues the study due to the sign or symptom, and/or
!the sign or symptom is new to the subject or not consistent with the subject’s 
pre-existing asthma history (defined as within 1 year of Visit 1 as judged by 
[CONTACT_093].
Asthma exacerbations should not be recorded as AEs after randomization, unless it fulfils any 
of the above criteria.  All asthma exacerbations should be recorded in the exacerbation eCRF 
as per section 5.1.1 .

study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs during the course of the study, Investigators or other site personnel must 
inform the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day (i.e., immediately) but no 
later than [ADDRESS_1217370] inform [COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within 1 calendar day (i.e., immediately) but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes 
aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert will be sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative(s).
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative(s) by [CONTACT_756].
The [COMPANY_008] representative(s) will advise the Investigator/study site personnel how to 
proceed.
The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the Investigator’s 
Brochure for the [COMPANY_008] IP.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose with associated AEs is to be recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF, as well as in the Overdose eCRF module.
An overdose without associated symptoms is only to be reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.

anaphylaxis (Lieberman et al 2010). Details on anaphylaxis management are provided in Appendix G.
Anaphylaxis will be defined as serious reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death
(Sampson et al 2006). Anaphylaxis typi[INVESTIGATOR_244860] 1 of 3 clinical scenarios:
1. The acute onset of a reaction (minutes to hours) with involvement of the 
skin, mucosal tissue or both and at least one of the following: a) respi[INVESTIGATOR_62616]; or b) reduced blood pressure or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_291422]: involvement 
of the skin/mucosal tissue, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms and/or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure.
Subjects will have had a pre-assessment (i.e., vital signs and lung function) prior to IP 
administration.  At Visits 3 through 6, subjects should be observed for a minimum of 2 hours after IP administration for the appearance of any acute drug reactions. For the remaining visits involving IP administration, subjects will be observed for a minimum of 1 hour after IP administration for any such reaction.
In order to help understand the potential drug-relatedness of any acute reaction, a blood 
sample should be drawn during the event for additional ADA testing (if not already scheduled as per table 1 for this visit). If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a blood sample will be drawn from the subject as soon as possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± [ADDRESS_1217374] treatment, will evaluate all ER or

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY [CONTACT_76383]
8.1 Statistical considerations
The main objectives of this study are to show efficacy of tralokinumab vs. placebo in two 
populations, the all-subjects and a biomarker positive population, with regards to asthma exacerbations (primary) and asthma control (key secondaries).
There are two pre-specified populations studied in this study; the all subject populations and 
the biomarker positive population. The all subject population is the same as that studied in another pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] (D2210C00007) run in parallel. The biomarker positive population is not 
defined at the finalization of the clinical study protocol for this study, but will be defined 
based on results from study D2210C00007.  The statistical analysis plan will be updated with this definition before the unblinding of the current study (D2210C00008). 
With regards to the key secondary objectives around asthma control; to show increased 
asthma control for tralokinumab vs. placebo the following is considered necessary:

give additional support for increased asthma control.
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared prior to first subject 
randomized and any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments 
completed prior to unblinding of the data. Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_871563].
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until the database is 
locked and all protocol violations are identified.
8.[ADDRESS_1217392] (385 subjects per group) are considered sufficient to 
show a reduction in annualised asthma exacerbation rate for tralokinumab, versus placebo in the overall study population. 
Sample size calculations in terms of number of subject years needed is based on an assumed 
annual exacerbation rate in the placebo group of 0.8, and shape parameter of 0.95 (over-dispersion) in both the all-subject and biomarker positive population. The calculations are 
made for a 1% significance level for all subjects and a 4% significance level for the biomarker 
positive population. The methodology used described in Keene et al 2007 . 
Assuming a uniform loss to follow-up of 15% during the study, [ADDRESS_1217393] 90% power for showing superiority with effects down to 37% asthma exacerbation rate reduction in the all-subject population. 
The proportion of subjects in the all-subject population falling within the biomarker positive 
subpopulation will depend on the biomarker positive criteria to be defined in the SAP before un-blinding of this study. Based on results from study D2210C00007, the testing strategy for 
this study has been revised to use a 5% significance level based on the biomarker positive 
population as the primary population, and it is estimated that approximately 20% to 35% of the studied subjects will fulfil the biomarker positive criteria. Using a 5% significance level 
for the biomarker positive population as the primary population, a true asthma exacerbation 
rate reduction of 50% would have a power between 70% and 90% to show superiority.
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets
All efficacy analyses will be performed using an ITT approach based on the full analysis set. 
For consistency, demographic and baseline characteristics will be presented using the full analysis set. Safety objectives will be analyzed based on the Safety population.

For the reporting of efficacy data, the biomarker positive and negative population will be a 
subset of the Full analysis set; the primary population for analysis is the biomarker positive 
population. For the reporting of safety data, the biomarker positive and negative population 
will be a subset of the Safety analysis set, and for the reporting of PK data, the biomarker positive and negative population will be a subset of the PK analysis set.
8.3.1 Efficacy analysis set
Full analysis set: All subjects randomized and receiving any IP will be included in the full 
analysis set, irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study. 
Subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment, irrespective of whether or 
not they have prematurely discontinued. For subjects who withdraw consent or assent to 
participate in the study all data will be included up to the date of their study termination. 
8.3.2 Safety analysis set
Safety analysis set (Safety): All subjects who received any IP will be included in the safety 
analysis set. Subjects will be classified according to the treatment they actually received. A 
subject who has on one, or several occasions, received active treatment will be classified as active. All safety summaries will be based on this analysis set.
8.3.3 PK analysis set
Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PK): All subjects in the full analysis set who received 
Tralokinumab; including PK blood samples that are assumed not to be affected by [CONTACT_871564] (e.g., disallowed medication, or incorrect study medication

[IP_ADDRESS] Visit and period windows
For the exacerbation-related analyses no windows will be applied. 
For the patient reported questionnaires collected in the ePRO, the variables will be 
summarized based on the protocol scheduled Days with ± 3-day window. 
For the other questionnaires, the window is the same as the protocol-defined visit windows. 
For local laboratory data, and all vital signs, the visit recorded in the WBDC system will be used. 
For the central laboratory results and other endpoints that present visit-based data, the 
variables will be summarized based on the scheduled days with adjusted analysis-defined visit windows. 
A more detailed definition of visit and period windows will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan.
8.4.2 Calculation or derivation of efficacy variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Exacerbation rateThe primary endpoint is the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) up to Week 52.  
In the statistical analysis, the number of asthma exacerbations experienced by a subject during 
the 52-week double-blind treatment period will be used as response variable, and the logarithm of the subject’s corresponding follow-up time will be used as an offset in the 
analysis to adjust for subjects having different exposure times during which the events occur. 
Asthma exacerbation is defined in Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_1217396] during the 52-week 
treatment period the following rule will be applied: 
!The start of an exacerbation is defined as the start date of systemic corticosteroids, 
ER or urgent care visits requiring systemic corticosteroids, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871553], whichever occurs earlier, and the end date is defined as the last day 
of systemic corticosteroids or ER or urgent care visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], whichever occurs later.

randomization to the date of Visit 29. For a subject lost to follow-up, this will be defined as the time from randomization to the time point after which an exacerbation could not be 
assessed. 
For the production of summary statistics, the annual asthma exacerbation rate per subject is 
calculated, and standardized per a 52-week period according to the formula described below.
Annual Exacerbation Rate = No. of Exacerbations*365.25 / (Follow-up date – Visit 3 date +

Time from randomization to the first asthma exacerbation will also be used as a supportive 
variable to the primary objective, and is calculated as follows:
Start Date of first asthma exacerbation − Date of Randomization + 1.
The time to first asthma exacerbation for subjects who do not experience an asthma 
exacerbation during the treatment period will be censored at the date of their last visit for the 
52-week double-blind treatment period, or at the time point after which an exacerbation could not be assessed.

Asthma symptoms during night-time and daytime will be recorded by [CONTACT_479999]. Symptoms will be recorded using a scale 0-3, where [ADDRESS_1217400] is missing a value for either daytime or 
night-time asthma symptom score on a given day then the total score for that day will be set to 
missing.

99(125)The key secondary outcome variable is the biweekly mean daily asthma symptom total score. 
The daily asthma symptom total score is defined as the sum of the daytime and night-time 
symptom scores as captured in the Asthma Daily Diary. The biweekly mean is calculated as the mean daily asthma symptom total over 14 sequential days.  If more than 7 daily scores 
(>50%) within that period is missing, then the daily asthma symptom mean score is set to 
‘missing’. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescue medication use
The number of rescue medication inhalations and nebulizer treatments taken will be recorded 
by [CONTACT_479989].
The number of inhalations of rescue medication captured in the eDiary each day will be 
calculated per subject. If a subject is missing a value for either morning or evening rescue 
medication on a given day, then the total rescue medication use for that day will be set to 
missing.
Total rescue medication use, defined as the average number of inhalations (puffs) per day will
be calculated as the outcome variable.
[IP_ADDRESS] Home peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (morning and evening)
Changes from baseline in morning and evening PEF up to Week 52 will be calculated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6)
In the ACQ-6 questionnaire the subjects are asked to recall the status of their asthma during 
the previous week with regards to symptom, use of short acting β-agonists and BD. The 
questionnaire includes questions on
1. Awoken at night by [CONTACT_23805]
2. Limitation of normal daily activities
3. Waking in the morning with symptoms4. Dyspnoea
5. Wheeze
6. Daily rescue medication
The questions of the ACQ-6 are measured on a 7-point scale scored from 0 (totally controlled) 
to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The ACQ-6 score is computed as the un-weighted mean of the 
responses.
Other variables based on ACQ-6 to report include:

The AQLQ(S)+12) will be first completed at Visit 3 (Week 0), which will be used as the 
baseline assessment. Subjects are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 
weeks and to score each of the 32 questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) 
to 1 (severe impairment).
The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions. The 4 individual domain 
scores (4 domains assessing 1) symptoms, 2) activity limitations, 3) emotional function, and 
4) environmental stimuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the domains. 
The key outcome variable for the AQLQ(S)+[ADDRESS_1217401]-randomization score minus baseline score, there will be no imputation for missing 
values.

[IP_ADDRESS] The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus 
Classroom Impairment Questions (WPAI+CIQ)
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom Impairment 
Questions (WPAI+CIQ) will be first completed at Visit 3 (Week 0), which will be used as the 
baseline assessment.
The WPAI+CIQ questionnaire is a 10-item questionnaire that assesses productivity and 
activity impairment over the previous week.
There are a maximum of 10 questions and a minimum of 3 questions that will be completed 
by [CONTACT_480000]:
1. Currently employed (yes/no)
2. Hours missed work due to health problems3. Hours missed work due to other reasons4. Hours actually worked
5. Degree health affected productivity while working (0-[ADDRESS_1217403])
6. Attends class in an academic setting (yes/no)7. Hours missed class due to health problems
8. Hours actually attended class
9. Degree health affected productivity while attending class (0-[ADDRESS_1217404])
10. Degree health affected regular activities (other than work or class) (0-[ADDRESS_1217405])
If the answer to question 1 is ‘No, not currently employed’, then the subject should skip to 
question 6. If the answer to question 6 is ‘No, not currently attending class’, then the subject 
should skip to question 10.
The WPAI+CIQ provide 4 scores: 
!Absenteeism (work or class time missed),
!Presenteeism (impairment at work or class/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), 
!Work productivity loss (overall work or class impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism)

For the work related questions, the following calculations should be used to create the 
outcomes of interest:
!Absenteeism = Q2/(Q2+Q4)
!Presenteeism = Q5/10
!Work Productivity Loss = Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)]

The following safety data will be collected: vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead dECG, 
hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and reported AEs.
Change from baseline (Visit 3) to each post-baseline time point where scheduled assessments 
were made will be calculated for relevant measurements.

considered an on treatment event. Similarly, if an AE has a partial onset date, then unless the partial onset date or the stop date indicates otherwise, this will be considered an on treatment 
AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other significant adverse events
During the evaluation of the AE data, an [COMPANY_008] medically qualified expert will review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs or discontinuations due to AEs. 
Based on the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may, after 
consultation with the Global Patient Safety Physician, be considered other significant AEs (OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR.
Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain 
events that led to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), dose reduction, or significant additional treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory variables
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis 
parameters will be taken at the times detailed in the CSP, and will be assessed in a central laboratory. The parameters outlined in Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 and Table 5 in Section

subsequent scheduled assessment will be calculated. Baseline is defined as the last available 
value measured prior to the first dose of randomized treatment. The change from baseline is 
defined as the treatment period value minus the baseline period value. There will be no imputation for missing values.
Absolute values will be compared to the relevant reference range and classified as low (below 
range), normal (within range or on limits) or high (above range). The [COMPANY_008] extended reference ranges will be used for laboratory variables (where they exist). All values (absolute 
and change) falling outside the reference ranges will be flagged.
Urinalysis data will be categorised as negative (0), trace or positive (+) at each time-point. For the purposes of haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis shift tables, baseline will 
be defined as the latest non-missing assessment prior to first dose, and on-treatment will be 
defined as the latest non-missing assessment whilst the subject is ongoing on treatment.

[IP_ADDRESS] dECGs
Twelve-lead dECG measurements will be recorded in accordance with the protocol, with the 
baseline visit being defined as Visit 1.
The outcome of the overall evaluation is to be recorded as normal/abnormal in the eCRF, with 
any abnormalities being recorded as not clinically significant or clinically significant.
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical examination
Complete and brief physical examinations will be performed at time points specified in Table 1 . 
What is included in the assessment will be dependent on whether the examination is complete or brief, as described in Section 5.1.7 . For the brief physical examination, only information on 
whether the assessment was performed or not will be recorded.
Each component of the baseline visit (i.e., Visit 3) complete physical examination will be 
recorded as normal or abnormal. Each component of the follow-up complete physical 
examinations will be recorded as normal, same as baseline, or new/aggravated.
Any new finding(s), or aggravated existing finding(s), judged as clinically significant by [CONTACT_3786], will be reported as an AE.

kilograms) as follows: 
BMI = kg/m2
8.4.5 Calculations or derivation of Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity variables
Blood samples (processed to serum) for pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity assessments 
will be collected from all subjects at baseline prior to first IP administration at Visit 3, at 
multiple time points before IP administrations during the treatment period, and at selected 
time points in the follow-up phase of the study. Anti-drug antibodies assessments will be conducted utilizing a tiered approach (screen, confirm, titer). These validated methods are 
conducted using a bridging assay format and statistically determined floating screening assay 
cut point factor and confirmatory assay cut point. The minimal sample dilution is 1:13. Titer values are reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that yields a value above the cut 
point. Samples from pre-defined study time points that confirm positive for ADA will also be 
tested for neutralizing ADA/nAb activity. Both ADA and nAb will be summarized using descriptive statistics as described in Section 8.5.9 .
Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of tralokinumab:
Tralokinumab serum concentrations will be tabulated by [CONTACT_480002].  
Population PK modelling may also be performed to better characterize the PK of tralokinumab, but will be reported separately from the CSR. 
The incidence rate of ADA to tralokinumab will be reported by [CONTACT_480003]. 
If possible and if relevant, the impact of ADA occurrence on the PK and PD and safety will be 
summarized in the CSR.
8.5 Methods for statistical analyses
The main focus for the statistical analyses is to compare tralokinumab to placebo in the two 
pre-defined populations, all subjects and biomarker positive subjects, with regards to primary, key secondary, and safety objectives.
The analysis of the study endpoints will include all data captured during the 52-week double-
blind treatment period. This includes data regardless of whether study treatment was prematurely discontinued or delayed, and/or irrespective of protocol adherence, unless the 
subject withdraws consent or assent to study participation. The statistical analyses will 
compare tralokinumab to placebo.

8.5.1 Testing strategy for primary and key secondary objectives
The pre-defined hierarchical testing strategy for testing of the primary and key secondary 
hypothesis in the primary populations described below, gives global strong control of the Type I error (FWER). 
Step 1: The primary endpoint in the biomarker positive population will be tested two-sided at 
α=0.05
Step 2: If a significant treatment effect is shown with regards to the primary endpoint in the 
biomarker positive population in Step 1, then the key secondary endpoint, percent change 
from baseline in pre-dose/pre-BD FEV
1 at Week 52 vs. placebo will be tested two-sided at 
α=0.05 within that population using the hierarchical testing approach. Otherwise, testing will 
stop. All subsequent results within the hierarchy will be declared non-significant.
Step 3: If a significant treatment effect is shown with regards to the key secondary endpoint 
percent change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-BD FEV 1 at Week 52 vs. placebo in the 
biomarker positive population in Step 2, then the next key secondary endpoint, change from 
baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 at Week 52 vs. placebo will be tested two-sided at α=0.05 within 
that population using the hierarchical testing approach. Otherwise, testing will stop. All 
subsequent results within the hierarchy will be declared non-significant.
Step 4: If a significant treatment effect is shown with regards to the key secondary endpoint 
change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 at Week 52 vs. placebo in the biomarker positive 
population in Step 3, then the next key secondary endpoint, change from baseline in ACQ-6 at 
Week 52 vs. placebo will be tested two-sided at α=0.05 within that population using the 
hierarchical testing approach. Otherwise, testing will stop. All subsequent results within the 
hierarchy will be declared non-significant.
Step 5: If a significant treatment effect is shown with regards to the key secondary endpoint 
of change from baseline in ACQ-6 at Week 52 vs placebo in the biomarker positive 
population, then the key secondary endpoint of change from baseline in bi-weekly mean daily 
asthma symptom score at Week 52 vs placebo in the biomarker positive population and the primary endpoint in the all subjects population will be tested using a Bonferroni approach at 
significance α. Hence, each of the two endpoints will be tested at significance level α/2 
(=0.025). If at least one significant treatment effect is shown at this step, testing will continue

107(125)to step 6. Otherwise, testing will stop. All subsequent results within the hierarchy will be 
declared non-significant.
Step 6: Percent change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-BD FEV [ADDRESS_1217408] is shown 
at step 5. There are two different outcomes in Step 5 that could result in testing the hypothesis 
for FEV 1:
(a) If both comparisons in step 5 exhibits significance, then FEV 1 in the all subjects 
population is testable and will be tested at significance level α (=0.05).
(b) If only one of the hypotheses in step 5 exhibits significance, then FEV 1in the all 
subjects population is testable and will be tested at significant level α/2 (=0.025).
Step 7: If a significant treatment effect is shown with regards to percent change from baseline 
in pre-dose/pre-BD FEV 1 at Week 52 vs. placebo in the all subjects population then change 
from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 at Week 52 vs placebo will be tested using the significance 
level used in step 6 ( α (=0.05) if outcome (a) from Step 5, or α/2 (=0.025) if outcome (b) from 
step 5). Otherwise, testing will stop. All subsequent results within the hierarchy will be declared non-significant.
Step 8: If a significant treatment effect is shown with regards to change from baseline in 
AQLQ(S)+12 at Week 52 vs placebo in the all subjects population then change from baseline in ACQ-6 at Week 52 vs placebo will be tested using the significance level used in step 7 ( α 
(=0.05) if outcome (a) from Step 5, or α/2 (=0.025) if outcome (b) from step 5). Otherwise, 
testing will stop. All subsequent results within the hierarchy will be declared non-significant.
Step 9: If a significant treatment effect is shown with regards to change from baseline in 
ACQ-6 at Week 52 vs placebo in the all subjects population then change from baseline in bi-
weekly mean daily asthma symptom score vs placebo will be tested using the significance level used in step 8 ( α (=0.05) if outcome (a) from Step 5, or α/2 (=0.025) if outcome (b) from 
step 5). Otherwise, testing will stop. All subsequent results within the hierarchy will be 
declared non-significant.

For each population the primary objective will be evaluated through the hypothesis test:
H0: rate ratio (tralokinumab/placebo) equals 1 vs.
H1: rate ratio does not equal 1. 
The AAER in the tralokinumab group will be compared to that seen in the placebo group 
using a negative binomial model. The response variable in the model will be the number of 
asthma exacerbations experienced by a subject, over the 52-week double-blind treatment period. Covariates and factors included in the model will include at least treatment and the 
stratifying variables. The logarithm of the subject’s corresponding follow-up time will be used 
as an offset variable in the model to adjust for subjects having different exposure times during which the events occur.
The standard parameterization approach (NB2) of the Negative Binomial model will be 
applied ( Hilbe 2011 ).
The estimated treatment effect (i.e., the rate ratio of tralokinumab versus placebo), 
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and two-sided p-value for the rate ratio will be 
presented. In addition, the AAER and the corresponding 95% CI within each treatment group will be presented.

the [COMPANY_008] defined reference ranges will also be displayed on the shift plots.
Data for subjects who have treatment-emergent changes outside the predefined criteria will be 
presented. This data presentation will include all visits for this subset of subjects.
The frequency of changes with respect to normal ranges between baseline and each post-
treatment time point will be tabulated. Frequencies of clinically noteworthy values (using 
[COMPANY_008] defined reference ranges) occurring during the clinical study will also be given.
In order to identify potential Hy’s Law cases, maximum post baseline total bilirubin will be 
plotted against maximum post baseline ALT, expressed as multiples of ULN. This plot will be 
repeated to show maximum post baseline total bilirubin against maximum post baseline AST, 
expressed as multiples of ULN. These plots will be produced on a log scale and reference lines will be included at 2xULN for total bilirubin and at 3xULN for ALT/AST. 
For all subjects who meet the biochemical criteria for Hy’s law (potential Hy’s Law), a 
Subject Safety Narrative will be produced, and the relevant laboratory parameters will be tabulated showing all visits for these subjects. Subjects with elevated ALT or AST, and 
elevated total bilirubin, at any time may be explored further graphically using individual 
subject profile plots.
For urinalysis data, a shift table will be generated to present changes from baseline to EOT. 
The number of subjects with treatment-emergent changes will also be summarized. Here,

Descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, and 
range of the actual ADA titers by [CONTACT_6982], where possible, will be provided. 
The ADA status across the study for each subject will also be classified and summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The association of ADA status across the study with AEs/SAEs may be 
evaluated. In addition, the association of ADA titers ( ≥median titer in positive subjects vs. < 
median titer) with AE/SAEs may be evaluated for ADA-positive treated subjects only. The ADA-positive subjects across the study may also be divided into persistent positive versus 
transient positive. A subject will be considered as persistent positive if he/she has positive 
ADAs for at least two consecutive visits (with ≥ [ADDRESS_1217415] positive 
value). Otherwise, the subject will be considered as transient ADA positive. The associations 
between ADA and AE/SAEs may be summarized for both persistent positive subjects versus 
transient positives subjects. 
Neutralizing antibody evaluations will be conducted on confirmed ADA positive samples.

Immunogenicity variables will be based on the safety analysis set.
Due to the limited sampling schedule, the PK assessment will be primarily based on the 
observed serum trough (predose) concentrations, C
trough. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_680233] C trough may be conducted.   
The PK data may be merged with those from other clinical studies for a population-based 
meta-analysis. If performed, results of the meta-analysis will be presented in a separate 
pharmacometrics report outside of the CSR.

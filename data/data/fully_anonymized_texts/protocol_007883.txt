pharmacodynamics, efficacy , and pharmacokinet ics (PK)of TIMP- GLIA in subjects with well -
controlled celiac disease ( CD)following an oral  gluten challenge. Subjects aged 18 to 70 y ears 
inclusive, with documented history  of biopsy -proven confirmed CD, and on a gluten-free diet 
(GFD )for a minimum o f 6 months, arescreened. Subjects who m eet all inclusio n and no 
exclusio n criteria, and provi de wri tten informed consent, arerandomized within 45 days after 
Screening to receive 2 IVinfusio ns of TIMP -GLIA, 8 mg/kg up to a maximum of 650 mg or 
placebo (norm al saline) in a 1:[ADDRESS_18908] isperformed on Days 15, 20 and 29. Subjects areasked to complete the Celiac 
Symptom  Index -Modified (CSI -M) questionnaire on Day s 15, 20, 29, and 35. 
During the Screening period and prior to the first dos e on Day  1, subjects under goa small bowel 
biopsy. The biopsy is repeated on Day  29 (-1 day ). An independent, blinded patho logist revi ews
biopsies to determine the Vh:Cd and the number of intestinal  intraepi [INVESTIGATOR_20075](IELs ). 
Subjects areobserv ed for acute adverse events ( AEs), including infusio n reactions ( IRs), for up 
to [ADDRESS_18909] 
consumption of gluten on Day  15. Subjects areassessed for safet y and tol erabili ty, incl uding 
AEs, physical exam, vital signs, routine clinical lab tests (chemistry  and hematol ogy), and 
laboratory  tests for DGP -IgG on Day s 1, 8, 15, 20, 29, and 35. Safet y laboratory  tests for 
complement levels (C3a, C5a, and SC5b -9), and serum  cytokines areperformed on Days 1, 2, 8, 
9, and 15. Samples for C1q binding areperform ed on Day s 1, 15, 20, 29, and 35. 
Blood iscollected for analysis of gliadin -specific IFN -ɣ ELISpot, T cell pro liferat ion, cy tokine 
secretion, and gut -homing cells, pre -dose on Day  1, before starting the gluten challenge on Day  
15, and Day  20 ([ADDRESS_18910] consumpt ion of gluten). 
Blood f or PK (plasma gliadin concentrations) is collected on Day  8.

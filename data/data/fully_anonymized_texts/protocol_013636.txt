INTRODUCTION :  
 
A biomedical or health -related research  study is performed to answer specific questions about 
a disease.    
 
Before you agree to participate in this research study, it is important that you be told the 
purpose, procedures, benefits, risks, discomforts, and precautions of the research. You 
shoul d also be told what alternative procedures are available to you if you do not participate in 
the research study.  The informed consent document is a written summary of this information. 
Be sure to ask questions while you read this consent document and ask questions if there is 
anything that you do not understand.   
 
Your participation in this research study is entirely voluntary.  
 
You may choose either to take part or not to take part in this research study. If you decide to 
take part, you may decide to le ave the study at any time. Leaving the study will not result in 
any penalty or loss of benefits to you.  
 
The researcher and sponsor of this study do not promise that you will receive any benefits

 WHY IS THIS RESEARCH BEING DONE?  
 
The p urpose of this research study is to compare two approaches to reducing the risk of 
future opi[INVESTIGATOR_875757] a non -fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]. The first 
approach entails providing the individual with a NARCAN® kit, which can be used to  help 
reverse an opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], and written information about overdose and substance use 
disorder treatment. The second approach expands upon the first approach by [CONTACT_875763] a 
telephone, peer -based intervention to the individual.

WHAT IS INVOLVE D IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
1.  SCREENING /BASELINE  
If you decide to volunteer and sign this consent form, you will start screening procedures that 
help us to see whether or not this study is suitable for you.  Screening procedures will take 
approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete. The things that w ill happen during screening 
are done only for this research study and are not part of any other routine healthcare you may 
receive . For screening, you will be asked to : 
• Answer questions about your alcohol and drug use, about things that can increase the 
risk of overdose, knowledge about overdose risk, and your knowledge, interest in, and 
barriers to getting treatment;  
• Answer basic questions about your gender, race, and ethnicity;  
• Provide contact [CONTACT_875766] e and sign 
a release of information for them  
• Provide a urine sample to screen for drug use.  
 
If after completing the screening process you are found to be eligible, this means that you can 
take part in the study if you choose to do so.  If you are found to be ineligible, this means that 
you cannot take part in the study.  Either way, you will receive $50 for your time and effort for 
completing the entire screening process.  
 
2.  RANDOMIZATION  
If you are eligible and agree to take part in the study, y ou will be "randomized" into one of the 
study groups described below. Randomization means that you are put into a group completely 
by [CONTACT_3364]. It is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin . 
 
If you are randomized to the control condition, you will receive contact [CONTACT_875767] (MAT) programs, educational information about Opi[INVESTIGATOR_711935] (OOD) and about MAT, and a NARCAN® Nasal Spray kit; all of which will be 
provided during the enrollment visit.  
 
If you are randomized to the experimenta l condition, you will receive contact [CONTACT_875768], educational information about OOD and about MAT, and a NARCAN® 
Nasal Spray kit; all of which will be provided during the enrollment visit. You will receive a set 
of three personali zed reports, and you will be scheduled to receive the Tailored Telephone 
Intervention delivered by [CONTACT_875769][INVESTIGATOR_305109] (TTIP -PRO) 
intervention within about 2 weeks following your enrollment into the study.   
 
3.  TTIP -PRO   
If you ar e randomized to the experimental condition, you will receive the TTIP -PRO 
intervention which consists of two parts: 1) a [ADDRESS_1223088]; and 2) a set of three personalized reports, including a r eport on 
your personal risk factors for experiencing another OOD.  The call will be recorded and stored 
long enough for an expert trainer to review the call for quality assurance purposes, after which 
the file will be deleted.

feedback on the int ervention you received following randomization.   
 
In-Person Visits  
You will be asked to come for follow -up visits 3, 6, and 12 months following your enrollment into 
the study.  At each of these visits you will be asked to:  
• complete questionnaires and interviews about how you have been feeling since the last 
study contact, your recent alcohol and drug use, whether or not you have had any 
additional overdoses, whether or not you have enrolled in MAT for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], 
and whether  the NARCAN® Nasal Spray kit you received was used to help reverse an 
overdose;  
• provide releases of information for medical records to confirm enrollment in MAT;  
• provide a urine sample to screen for drug use.  
 
At the month 3 and month 6 follow -up visits, you will also be asked to confirm/update information 
for people who can help us locate you in the future.  
 
At the month [ADDRESS_1223090] approximately 40 minutes.  
 
If you are currently or become a prisoner (including being in jail or prison, being on probation 
or parole, or being under house arrest or electronic monitoring), we would still like to find out 
how you are doing. There fore, if necessary , we will make an effort to collect follow -up data from 
you over the phone or in person.  Please note that your continued participation, in this event, 
will have no effect on your criminal case, or release or parole from jail or prison, o r probation 
case.

Emotional Discomfort : You may also experience some emotional disco mfort from answering 
sensitive and/or personal questions. You may experience embarrassment in answering 
questions about your knowledge of MAT and opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]. You can choose to not answer 
questions that you find to be too uncomfortable, or you may choo se to withdraw from the 
study if you find participation too stressful.  
 
Improper administration of the intervent ion by [CONTACT_875771] :  The Peer 
Interventi onists will be provided with  your first name [CONTACT_875778] a secure 
manner. As such, there is a chance of improper administration of the intervention. In order to 
prevent this , we will train and grade the Peer Interventionist candidates before allowing them 
to perform the intervention(s).  
 
Side Effects of NARCAN® Nasal Spray : 
NARCAN® Nasal Spray is an FDA -approved medication  indicated for the emergency 
treatment of known or suspected opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211].  The primary side effect of NARCAN® is 
sudden opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801].  In someone who has been using opi[INVESTIGATOR_875759],

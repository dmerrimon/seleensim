1.1 SYNOPSIS   
 
Title:  Mobile Technology and Data Analytics to Identify Real- Time Predictors of Caregiver Well- Being  
 
Study Description: Care partners (i.e., informal family caregivers) of individuals with health problems 
are faced with considerable physical and emotional stress, often with substantial negative impact on the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of both the care partner and care -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Care partners may be 
suddenly thrust into this full -time role and are often unprepared. As responsibilities accumulate, they 
face emergent health risks, including anxiety, fatigue, isolation, sleep problems, and decreased physical activity. Indeed, there is growing recognition that these psychological, social, and physical risks inadvertently  affect patient health and well- being (i.e., outcomes). Thus, it is imperative to develop 
novel interventions to support caregivers to ensure better patient outcomes.  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_611528] U.S. pop ulation and 
evolving health -care system, very little action has been taken to understand and improve conditions for 
caregivers. Thus, family caregiving (i.e., care partners) is an urgent public health issue. With high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_9103], insomn ia, and stress -related disorders, care partners are an ideal population to 
target for early detection and intervention strategies to treat compromised well -being. While 
psychoeducation, skills training, or therapeutic counseling interventions can be effective for care partners, these interventions require intensive time and face-to -face commitment (with trained 
personnel), which can be prohibitive for an individual that is already overwhelmed by [CONTACT_611547] -care.  
 In this study, we will examine  the acceptability and feasibility of a data collection protocol that involves 
the delivery of a personalized self- management intervention to  promote care partner self -care. This 
just- in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an emerging intervention that incorporates passiv e mobile 
sensor dat a feedback (sleep and activity [step]  data from a Fitbit ®),  and real-time self -reporting of 
HRQOL via study specific app called CareQOL to provide personalized feedback via app alert.  The 
proposed trial will examine the acceptability and feasibility of the JITAI in three distinct groups of care partners: 1) care partners for persons with a chronic condition that was caused by a traumatic event 
(i.e., spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] [SCI]); 2) care partners for persons with a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative 
disease ( i.e., Huntington disease [HD]); and 3) care partners for persons with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_611529], prolonged inpatient and outpatient treatment (persons with hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]).  
 Participants in this study will be randomized either to a control group, where they will wear the Fitbit® 
and provide d aily reports of HRQOL over a three -month  (90 day)  period (without the personalized 
feedback), or the JITAI group, where they will wear the Fitbit®, provide daily report s of HRQOL and 
receive personalized pushes for 3 months. 60 -90 participants will be enrolled (n=20 -30 care partners of 
persons with SCI; n=20 -30 care partners of persons with HD; and n=[ADDRESS_810898]). Half of the  care partners of each condition  will be randomized into  the JITAI group and half of the 
care partners of each condition will be randomized  in the control group.

able to read and understand English and be caring for an adult (age 18 or abo ve) with a medically 
documented diagnosis of SCI, HD or HCT. They must be willing to use their personal mobile device (e.g., smartphone, tablet) for this study, be willing to download the study app (CareQOL) and Fitbit® app and be willing to complete all study assessments.  
 Phase or Stage: Not applicable; behavioral intervention.  
 Description of Sites Enrolling Participants: There is one data collection site  for this study: The University 
of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI (n= 20-30 care partners of person with SCI, n=20 -30 care partners of 
persons with HD and n=[ADDRESS_810901] ). 
 Description of Study Intervention: Just -in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) is a mobile health behavior -
change approach that operationalizes the selection and delivery of personalized mobile device intervention strategies based on real -time data collection. In this study, a study -specific app (CareQOL 
app) will integrate sensor data from a Fitbit® (on physical activity and sleep) with real- time self -report 
ratings of HRQOL (caregiver strain, depression, anxiety) to inform the JITAI. The JITAI will deliver personalized messages via the app ~50% the days during the intervention period.   Study Duration: Data collection is expected to take 3 months . 
 
Participant Duration: The participant duration in the  study is ~100 days.

 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
SIGNIFICANCE  
Illness impacts the entire family, and the complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_611530] a collage of the 
experiences of both the affected patient and family care partner(s).[ADDRESS_810903] survived a serious illness or injury, the complexities of more advanced disease management and multifaceted care needs are also growing substantially. As a society, responsibility for addressing these needs has always been placed on family care partners, who face an enormous and growing burden providing care to a loved one while trying to maintain their own health and well- being (e.g., HRQOL).
[ADDRESS_810904] to help improve these care partners’ HRQOL, they are typi[INVESTIGATOR_125652]- i ntensi ve 
and expensive, and have limited success at improving HRQOL in these individuals. D espi[INVESTIGATOR_611531], reach and scalability with using mobile technologies (including JITAIs) to support healthy behavior change, their clinical utility in care partners remains untested. 
Furthermore, while  much research on care partners has focused on a one -size-fits all approach to 
assessment and treatment, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that while there are many commonalities in the caregiver experience, there are aspects of care that are inherently unique to 
different caregiver groups.
3-[ADDRESS_810905] caregiving populations  designed to represent 
three different patient populations: 1) caring for a person with a chronic condition that was caused b y a 
traumatic event (i.e., TBI); 2) caring for a person with a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease (i.e., HD); and 3) caring for a person with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_611532], prolonged inpatient and outpatient treatment (person s with hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]). These 
diverse caregiver groups not only allow for important between- population comparisons that can be 
used to inform future trial designs and maximize their impact; they also maximize the generalizability to other caregiving populations.  
Specifically, this study is designed to establish the acceptability and feasibility of an intensive data 
c
ollection protocol that involves passive mobile sensor data (using a Fitbit Charge®) and real- time 
patient -reported outcome (PRO) reports of symptoms and functioning (collected daily) in these three 
diverse caregiving populations.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
 Preliminary Studies.   
The proposed JITAI study methodology is modeled after and informed by [CONTACT_611551] ( R01MH101459; PI [INVESTIGATOR_611533]) . In an early phase of the Intern Health Study, physical 
activity and sleep were assessed using Fitbit ® Trackers, and daily ratings of mood were completed via 
text for N=38 medical interns. In this study, 92% of participants provided sleep, activity, and mood data 
on at least 80% of days. Data showed an expected strong association between sleep and mood, but found that sleep predicted mood the following day substantially more strongly than mood predicted subse quent sleep ( SleepMood b=0.12; p<0.001; Mood Sleep b=0.05; p=0.04; Figure ). They also 
found that, on a given night, the farther an individual’s sleep midpoint was from their pre -internship 
baseline midpoint, the  lower their mood  (p<0.001).
6 In a more recent study phase (a randomized 
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.0  
Protocol HUM000184455   23 Mar 2021  
 
  9 
 controlled trial comparing a JITAI with usual care; n=2053), findings indicated that receptivity to mobile 
health interventions was moderated by [CONTACT_4317]’ current state related to the target of the 
intervention. For instance, interventions around increasing sleep duration were most effective when participants had low sleep the night before, adding further conceptual backing for the JITAI approach.  In 
addition, the JITAI intervention demonstrated significant improvements in depression.  
  
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1  KN OWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
The risks associated with the proposed study are minor and infrequent and include risks to: i) confidentiality; ii) frustration, stress and/or anxiety; iii) and skin irritation:  
 
i. C
onfidentiality.  Confidentiality is a concern in this study. Every possible effort will be made 
to keep the research information in the strictest confidence, but we cannot absolutely guarantee that accidental disclosure will not happen. We remind participants that the 
responsibility of confidentiality rests with everyone: they should think carefully before 
discussing their role in this study with anyone since the effects of disclosure are unknow n. 
Additionally, during the 3- month home monitoring period, participants may receive alerts 
when the participant is not in a private area. Participants will be informed that it is up to 
them where they complete the daily assessments, and if it is inconvenient/uncomfortable for them to complete the assessments when prompted they can wait and do it when it is more convenient/private or skip that assessment.  
 
T
o reduce the risk to confidentiality, no personal identifying information will appear on or 
with the participant data, where possible. Each participant will be assigned a participant ID by [CONTACT_611552]. The participant’s self-report data and CRF 
data will be identified with the participant ID. Additionally, an access code will be assigned 
Figure  
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.0  
Protocol HUM000184455   23 Mar 2021  
 
  10 
 to each participant which they will use to enroll in the CareQOL  app.  Participants will 
register their study Fitbit ® on the Fitbit® app using a username [CONTACT_611581]. The study team will help the participant configure the  Fitbit® app for minimal 
sharing; however, participants may opt to change those settings on their own (without 
study team knowledge). The data collected on the Fitbit® will be linked to the CareQOL app 
by [CONTACT_611553], which is comprised of a random series of characters that is 
used to securely query for user activity data; no identifying information (including email address or Fitbit® user ID) is saved in the CareQOL app.  
 The study team wi ll keep a master list of participant names and matching participant IDs. 
This master list will not be shared outside of the study team , and will be kept by [CONTACT_611554] a password -protected file on a secure server or in a secure environment (e.g., 
locked cabinet, restricted access). No one other than the study team will have access to their master list. Informed consents will be stored in a study -specific database which 
contains only the informed consents and the informed consents will only be available to the  
study team membe rs. The electronic data collection and storage systems used (e.g., 
CareQOL  app, REDCap, Qualtrics, Fitbit®) are secure, web- based systems, with access to the 
study data limited to authorized individuals.   Lastly, the identities of all participants will be  held in strict confidence to the extent 
provided by [CONTACT_2371]. If findings from the study are published and/or presented at a professional meeting, no participant will be identified by [CONTACT_2300].  
 
ii. F
atigue, Frustration, Stress and/or Anxiety.   It is possible that par ticipants may experience 
fatigue, frustration or feel inconvenienced when completing the self -report surveys, when 
receiving the personalized interventions from the CareQOL app or from wearing the Fitbit®. Participants may also feel fatigue, stress and/or anxiety related to completing the study activities. Participants will be instructed that they can skip any questions that make them feel uncomfortable, and if they receive an app alert when it isn’t convenient for them, they can wait and open the app when it is more convenient.  
 
iii. S
kin Irritation.  Some participants may get skin irritation from wearing the Fitbit®. 
Participants will be instructed to remove the device if this occurs and to contact [CONTACT_3476]. Their band may be swapped out for a different type of wristband if they experience 
irritation. We offer a wide variety of wristbands to help make the Fitbit® as comfortable as 
possible.  
 T
o minimize the potential for risks, participants will be briefed in detail as to what they will experience 
throughout the study. All participants are informed that they may terminate participation from the study at any time without penalty.  
2.3.2  KN
OWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 The propose d study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of an intensive data collection 
protocol that involves the administrat ion of the JITAI intervention in care partners of persons with 
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.[ADDRESS_810906] benefits to participants, it is possible 
that participants may find that the JITAI improves their mood, stress levels, and/or overall quality of life. Additionally, some participants may also have a positive benefit from wearing the Fitbit®, as it may make them more aware of their activity levels and sleep. Overall, we expect that the findings from this study 
will help researchers further develop a personalized, easy to deploy, clinical intervention for care 
partners of persons with significant health conditions .

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.0  
Protocol HUM000184455   23 Mar 2021  
 
  12 
 Study Design: This behavioral trial will use a two -arm randomized controlled design. Each of the 60- 90 
care partner participants will be randomized to an active “JITAI” arm  (n=10 -15 care partners of SCI, 
n=10 -15 care partners of HD, n=[ADDRESS_810907])  or to a control arm  (n=10 -15 care partners 
of SCI, n=10 -15 care partners of HD, n=[ADDRESS_810908]) . The random allocation of 
participants to the treatment arm or control arm establishes the basis for testing the statistical 
significance or difference between the groups.  
 
R
andomization: Blocked randomization will be used to limit bias and achieve an equal distribution of 
participants to the control and treatment arms. A randomization list will be generated for each condition (SCI, HD, HCT) and the study statistician will oversee randomization. The participant will be randomized once he/she is deemed eligible and has provided informed consent (i.e. at e nrollment prior 
to baseline data collection). The study coordinator/research assistant who consented the participant will use the appropria te condition’s  randomization list to assign the participant to the correct study arm.  
 
Duration of Study Participation: Study participation for both arms of the study (control and JITAI) 
involves a baseline assessment, followed by [CONTACT_181867] 10 -day run -in period then a 3- month ( 90 
day) home monitoring period (in which the intervention will be administered to the JITAI group ). Thus, 
the total duration of the study is ~ 100 days.  
 
Study Sites : This is a single -site study at the  University of Michigan.  
 Study Intervention: The just in time adaptive intervention (JITAI) uses sensor data derived from the 
Fitbit® (e.g., accelerometer -based estimates of physical activity and sleep) and real- time self- report 
ratings (assessed once daily) of HRQOL (caregiver stra in, depression, anxiety) to deliver personalized 
“pushes” to participants via a study specific app  (CareQOL app) . The personalized pushes will be 
delivered on ~50% of the days over the 3- month intervention period.  
4.2 END-OF-S TUDY DEFINITION  
 The end of the study is defined as the completion of the 3 -month home monitoring period, specifically 
the end of month questionnaires (occurring at 90 days +/ - 7 days).   
 
[ADDRESS_810909] meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Provide informed consent  
2. Be at least 18 years of age  
3. Be able to read and understand English  
4. Provide emotional, physical, and/or financial support/assistance to the individual with SCI/HD/HCT , indicating a  response ≥1 to the following question: “On a scale of 0 -10, where 0 is 
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.0  
Protocol HUM000184455   23 Mar 2021  
 
  13 
 “no assistance” and 10 is “assistance with all activities”, how much assistance does the person 
you care for require from you to complete activities of daily living due to problems res ulting 
from his/her SCI/HD/HCT ? Activities could consist of personal hygiene, dressing and undressing, 
housework, taking medications, managing money, running errands, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_611534], transportation, meal preparation and cleanup, remembe ring things, etc.”  
5. Have access to necessary resources for participating in a technology -based intervention 
(smartphone/tablet and internet access) and be willing to use their personal 
equipment/internet for this study, including downloading the study app a nd the Fitbit® app on 
their mobile device  
6. Is able and willing to complete all study assessments for the duration of their study participation (approximately 100 days)  
7. Care partners of persons with HD: Be caring for an adult (18 years or older) with a clinical 
diagnosis of HD . Medical documentation of the HD is required. 
8. Care partners of persons with SCI:  Be caring for an adult (18 years or older) that is ≥[ADDRESS_810910]: Be caring for an adult (18 years or older) who is receiving, 
has received or is scheduled to receive  HCT. Medical documentation of the HCT is required.  
 
5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
An individual who meets the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:  
1. Is a professional, paid caregiver (e.g., home health aide)  
2. Anything that would preclude safe or meaningful participation in the study  
 
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
 
During this study, participants are asked to:  
• Wear a Fitbit® 24 hours/day, except when charging during the 10 -day run -in period and 3-
month ( 90 day) home monitoring period.  
• Install the CareQOL app and Fitbit® app on their personal mobile device, and keep these apps installed  for the duration of the study (~ 100 days).  
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Screen failures are unlikely in 
this study because eligibility assessment occurs pre -informed consent. However, if during the 10 -day 
run- in period before the  3-month home monitoring period starts the study team is made aware of 
something that would change their eligibility, the participant will be noted as a screen failure.

 5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Recruitment:  All recruitment activities will take place at University of Michigan (U- M). Recruitment and 
retention methods used in this study will be approved by t he IRBMED an d are de tailed in the IRBMED 
submission . Potential participants will be recruited directly or through the person they are caring for.  
 
S
CI Recruitment : The study team will primarily recruit through clinical databases (e.g., Data Direct and 
EMERSE) and participant registries, including the CODA registry  and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_611535] . Participants may also be recruited through outreach to S CI community groups and 
organizations.  
 
HD Recruitment:  The study team will primarily recruit through clinical databases (e.g., Data  Direct and 
EMERSE) and participant registries, including the CODA registry and the Enroll- HD study, where 
participants opt to be contact[CONTACT_611560]  (both the CO DA registry 
and Enroll -HD have individuals with HD and their care partners). Participants may also be recruited 
through outreach to HD community groups and organizations.  
 
HCT Recruitment:  The study team will recruit participants using several methods. Participants  will be 
recruited through the U -M Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program (BMT); weekly meetings are 
held where patients are considered for clinical trials/research studies. Clinical  databases (e.g., Data 
Direct and EMERSE) will be used for recruitment.  The Long- Term Follow -Up Biorepository will also be 
used for recru itment. Lastly, participants may be recruited from the Outpatient BMT clinic and through 
outreach to BMT health care providers and community engagement partners.  
 Individuals who are interested in participating will be encouraged to ask questions about the  study and 
their participation, and if they opt to enroll, they will provide informed consent prior to completing any study assessments.  
 In order to ensure that recruitment targets are being met, teleconference calls with the study recruitment teams by [CONTACT_3433] e project manager will be conducted to review progress, discuss problems, and 
guide additional recruitment efforts to meet stratification goals.  
 
Retention:  Giv
 en the intensive nature of this study, we expect that participants will miss some daily 
assessm ents and have times when they do not wear the Fitbit®; our retention plan is focused on 
minimizing these missed assessments and engaging participants throughout the study.  
 R
etention will be facilitated by [CONTACT_611561]:  
• App development will consider factors known to increase participant engagement including 
strategies to target engagement and minimize fatigue (easy to navigate platform, app tailoring based on Fitbit ® sensor feedback, etc.).
[ADDRESS_810911] that 
we will use to monitor participant engagement.  
• User guides and contact i nformation for the study team (phone and email) will be supplied to 
participants and they will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_611562].  
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.0  
Protocol HUM000184455   23 Mar 2021  
 
  15 
 • When enrolling participants, we will offer participants a choice of wristbands; they can select 
the wristband that is most comfortable and visually appealing to them. If they are not happy with their selection, we will provide an alternate wristband.  
• Study staff will maintain regular contact [CONTACT_401627]. All study participants will be contact[CONTACT_611563] -in period, at least once during the first week of the 
3-month home monitoring period and at least once each month during the remaining months of 
the 3-month home monitoring period.  
• Participants who do not complete any study assessments (e.g., uploading Fitbit® data or answering EMAs) for several days will receive a reminder from the study team.  
• In case of lost equipment/equipment failure during the run -in and home monitoring periods, we 
will send replacements as supplies allow.  
 
Participant Incentives:  W
 e will compensate participants for their time and inconvenience, as follows:  
o Baseline assessment : Participants will receive $2 0 for completing this assessment ($2 0 
total possible).  
o Monthly HRQOL surveys during the home monitoring period:  Participants will complete 
end of month surveys during the home monitoring period. Participants will receive $10 for completing each end of month survey for months 1 -3 ($30 total possible).  
o Daily EMA assessments and Fitbit® data during the 3-month home monitoring period: 
Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_810912] EMA and/or Fitbit® data during the three- month ( 90 day) home moni toring period ($90 total possible). 
o Participants who complete the study will be allowed to keep the Fitbit® that they use in 
the study.  
• Compensation will occur monthly to encourage prompt responding.  
• We may send out nominal value items (e.g., notepads, pens) throughout the duration of study participation to encourage engagement.  
6 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S) A DMINISTRATION  
 
All participants will receive a Fitbit ® for the collection of sleep and activity (steps) data, and will download the Fitbit® app and study app, CareQOL, on their personal mobile device (iOS or Android). The CareQOL app will deliver ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) once per day, compi[INVESTIGATOR_611536] (including that collected on the Fitbit®), and delive r study notifications, including messages for the 
participant to complete the daily EMA and other study surveys as well as delivering the personalized study intervention prompts to the intervention group (Just -in-time adaptive intervention [JITAI] group).  
 
All study participants will complete 3 EMA questions daily on the CareQOL app. Each participant will be 
prompted by a push notification in a five -hour window  (based on participant preference) from the app 
to answer the questions. The EMA questions are comprised of: 1 question on caregiver strain  (taken 
from the CareQOL Caregiver Strain item bank), 1 question on anxiety  (taken from the PROMIS Anxiety 
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.0  
Protocol HUM000184455   23 Mar 2021  
 
  16 
 item bank) and 1 question on depression  (taken from the PROMIS Depression item bank). Questions are 
on a five -point scale, with higher scores indicating more of the named construct.  
 
In addition to the collection of the EMA data, the app complies and displays a graphical summary of 
historical data for caregiver stress  (strain) , worry  (anxiety) , sadness  (depression) , steps (collected by [CONTACT_611564]®) and hours of sleep (collected by [CONTACT_31275]®) on a participant dashboard. Participants can view 
this information for the past week, past month or past year. This is available to all participants as a pull – that is, it is available at all times but is accessed only if the user chooses to access it.  
 In this study, half of the participants will be randomized to receive the intervention (JITAI; described below); the remaining participants will be in the control group, who will not receive the JITAI but will 
complete the activities already described in this section. Participants who are randomized to receive the JITAI will have a 50/50 chance of receiving the intervention each day.  
 
The JITAI aims to promote behavioral cha nge through motivational messages that are delivered through 
the CareQOL app as push notifications. These notifications provide a trigger for participants to initiate or 
continue behavior change and/or monitor behaviors (through engagement with the with th e app). The 
push notifications are low burden: participants can personalize the administration time ( in a 5 -hour 
window ) and notifications can be viewed quickly on their phone’s lock screen. Participants can also 
choose not to engage with the notification at the time it is sent if it is inconvenient – they can return to 
it later if needed.  
 The JITAI push notifications are aimed at promoting healthy behaviors (physical activity and good sleep hygiene) and improving mood (anxiety, depression, caregiver strai n). If receiving a notification, the 
message will be randomly drawn from this pool of messages. Some  messages will use participants’ data 
directly in the messages (e.g., You walked an average of 8,120 steps this week), and most  of messages 
will be personalized based on data (e.g., someone with low steps will get a different message than someone with medium steps than someone with high steps; high -medium -low). Messages are 
comprised of one or more of the following different types : 1) Data feedback; 2) Facts; 3) Tips; and 4) 
Support. Randomization of the days the participants receive messages and the message the participant receives from the pool will be done through the CareQOL app.  
 The study intervention period is 90 days ( 3 mon ths); in addition, there is an ~10 -day run -in period where 
participants will install/adjust/troubleshoot the study technology and the app will gather baseline data 
to use to tailor messages once the intervention period begins.   
6.[ADDRESS_810913] 
training during the baseline visit with each participant which will include:  
• Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_611537]® apps on their 
personal device  
• Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_611538] (e.g., make sure alerts are turned on/off, privacy settings, etc.)  
• Demonstrating the CareQOL app features to the participant (e.g., participant dashboard, etc.)  
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.0  
Protocol HUM000184455   23 Mar 2021  
 
  17 
 • Ensuring that the participant understands the importance of entering the daily ratings and 
wearing the Fitbit®  
• Explaining the relationship between the daily ratings and Fitbit® data and the intervention prompts (JITAI group only)  
• Demonstrating how to sync the Fitbit® (including using the Fitbit® app) and how to enter the daily ratings in the CareQOL app  
 During the [ADDRESS_810914] participants to make sure that participants can:  
• Successfully wear and sync the Fitbit®  
• Successfully respond to the EMA prompts  
 
Participants who are unable to successfully complete the run -in period will be terminated from the 
study and noted as a screen failure.  
 Training and training materials will be provided to all study team members. New study members will undergo training before the study is started. Training will be documented in the electronic regulatory binder.  
 
Participant adherence to the protocol will be assessed throughout the study. Study staff will have access 
to the CareQOL app dashboard which can be used to monitor participant engagement and adherence 
with the app. Specifically, study staff will monitor:  
• Adherence to EMA entry  
• Adherence to Fitbit® use/syncing 
• Adherence to completing the end  of month surveys (~30, 60, 90 day)  
 
Adherence will be calculated as a percentage for each of these areas for all participants who are not 
withdrawn or lost to follow -up. 
6.3 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
 There are no concomitant treatment or management strategy restrictions for this study. Information about current treatments (medications and non -medications) will be collected at baseline. Changes in 
treatments will be captured at the end of month 3 (~90 days) during the home monitoring period .

(~90  day) home monitoring period.  Study data will be collected via self- report into web or app -based 
surveys and a consumer wearable (Fitbit®).  
 
Eligibility and baseline procedures and assessments can be conducted virtually via 
teleconference/webinar. Daily, monthly and follow -up assessments will be conducted virtually through 
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.0  
Protocol HUM000184455   23 Mar 2021  
 
  19 
 the CareQOL app.  
 
8.1.1 CONDITION (SCI, HD, HCT)  DOCUMENTATION  
We will verify and document status of their condition (SCI, HD, HCT). Data must be obtained from official 
medical document ation (e.g. medical records).  
 
8.1.2 CARE PARTNER ELIGIBILITY  
Confirmation of care partner eligibility according to criteria listed in Section 5, above, will be documented on the Eligibility CRF. It will occur prior to informed consent being obtained and before any study procedures associated with baseline assessment. Eligible individuals will then participate in the consent process, followed by [CONTACT_611566].  
 8.1.3 DEMOGRAPHICS & CHARACTERIZATION  
All participants  will complete a series of surveys designed to characterize the sample with respect to 
demographics, caregiving experiences, and usual copi[INVESTIGATOR_611539].  
• P
articipant Demographics.  A study -designed form will be used to capture demographic data  
including age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, work status, COVID history/status, care partner data, care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_611540], etc. Administration time for this 
assessment is ~5 -10 minutes.  
• Medical History, Medications, Treatments, COVID Questionnaire .
  Study designed forms  will be 
used to capture medical history and c urrent treatments /management strategies  (medication 
and non -medication  – e.g., exercise, mindfulness ) and COVID history . Administration time for 
this assessment is 10 minutes.  
• Caregiver Appraisal Scale (CAS).  Th e CAS assesses positive and negative aspects of the caregiving 
role. Four separate subdomain scores (perceived burden, caregiver relationship satisfaction, 
caregiving ideology, and caregiving mastery) can be calc ulated; higher scores indicating better 
functioning. Administration time for this 47 -item measure is ~5 -10 minutes.  
• United Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Independence Scale . T he UHDRS Independence 
Scale is a single rating that the caregiver provides about the current level of the person that they 
care for’s independence. Higher ratings indicate higher level of independence. Administration 
time is less than 1 minute . 
• Supervision Rating Scale ( S RS). This is a single rating that the caregiver provide s about the 
overall amount of “supervision” that the person they care for  receives.  Ratings range from 1 -13; 
higher ratings indicate greater levels of required supervision.  Administration time is ~2 minutes.  
• Care Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_611541]. Study staff will complete a CRF with information 
about the person with SCI, HD or HCT for whom the care partner is providing care (e.g., date of 
diagnosis, details of diagnosis, disease stage/severity, etc.). This data will be entered into the 
study database by [CONTACT_464].

.1.4 FITBIT® AND CAREQOL APP  
Participants will be taught how to install both the Fitbit® and CareQOL apps onto their personal mobile devices. Participants will also to be taught how to create and login to the necessary accounts. See  
section 6.2 for details regarding participant education.  
• The study team will provide an access code for login to the CareQOL app.  
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.0  
Protocol HUM000184455   23 Mar 2021  
 
  20 
 • Participants will use a user id and personal email address of their choosing for their Fitbit® 
account.  
• Data collected from the Fitbit® will be securely transmitted to the CareQOL app by [CONTACT_611553], which is comprised of a random series of characters that is used to securely query for user activity data.  
• Participants will view their Fitbit® sl eep and step -count data through the CareQOL app, though 
there are not restrictions on them also viewing the information in the Fitbit® app.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FITBIT®  
All participants will don a wrist -worn Fitbit® with heart rate recording capabilities for the durat ion of the 
10-day run -in period and 3-month ( 90 day) home monitoring period to monitor activity and sleep. While 
we intend to use the Fitbit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_228141]®, we reserve the option to adopt a comparable device in the event of supply limitations or changes to the product line as long as there is minimal impact on the intervention delivery or primary outcome data integrity.  
• Participants may use a personal Fitbit® if it has comparable features.  
• Participants are expected to wear the Fitbit® continuously except for when charging and uploading data.  
• Participants are expected to sync the Fitbit® daily.  
 8.1.4. 2 CAREQOL APP  
The study app (CareQOL) is the participant -facing platform for all daily, monthly and follow -up 
assessments, for viewing sleep and step count data from the Fitbit®, and for intervention delivery. The 
daily and monthly assessments, the link with the Fitbit®, and intervention delivery will cease after the home monitoring period has elapsed.  
 8.1.4. 3 RUN -IN HOME MONITORING PERIOD  
A 10 -day run -in period will follow the baseline assessment. This period is to allow shippi[INVESTIGATOR_611542]® and provide the participant time to familiarize themselves with the study technology (Fitbit®, CareQOL app) and procedures. This period will also allow the study team to troubleshoot any potential barriers or issues that arise before the official start of the 3- month (90 day) home monitoring period. It 
also allows for data collection that can be used to inform the intervention messages once the h ome 
monitoring period begins.  
 8.1.5 HRQOL ASSSESSMENT  
Participants will complete a battery of HRQOL surveys; some will be administered daily and be used to drive the intervention, and others will be administered at baseline, monthly and during follow -up.  The 
individual survey administration schedule is shown in the Table , and descriptions are provided below.

 8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.2.1  D EFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The U -M IRBMED definition of an adverse event will be used for this study. The definition can be found 
at https://az.research.umich.edu/medschool/glossary  a nd is below:  
 An adverse event (AE ) is any experience or abnormal finding that has taken place during the course of a 
research project and was harmful to the subject participating in the research, or increased the risks of harm from the research, or had an unfavorable impact on the risk/be nefit ratio. The event may or may 
not be caused by [CONTACT_361299]. Adverse events also include psychological, social, emotional or financial harms.  
 
8.2.2  D
EFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The U -M IRBMED definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) will be u sed for this study. The definition 
can be found at https://az.research.umich.edu/medschool/glossary  a nd is below:  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse experience occurring at any dose or level of participation that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, o r 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

LASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 All AEs will be assessed by a principal investigator (s), and/or if necessary, a study co -investigator.  
 The following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incap acitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.

All adverse events (AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention, assessed b y an appropriately -trained investigator based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical 
judgment. All AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related or not related to 
the study intervention.  
 
• Related (Possible, Probable, Defi nite)  
o The event is a known or suspected effect of the intervention or research procedures 
(e.g., listed in the protocol documents including, consent, publications, etc.)  
o There is at least a reasonable temporal relationship between the intervention or proce dure and the event onset  
o The event abates when the intervention is discontinued  
o The event reappears upon a re -challenge with the intervention  
o The event includes data that was collected solely for research purposes  
o The event included disturbing or upsetting questions asked solely for research purposes  
 
• Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related)  
o The event is NOT a known or suspected effect of the study intervention or procedures  
o The event is readily explained by [CONTACT_611570]  
o There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset  
o An alternate etiology has been established  
[IP_ADDRESS]  E
XPECTEDNESS  
 
An investigator with appropriate expertise will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. An event that is expected has been addressed or described in one or more of the following: Informed consent document for this study, IRB application for this study, grant 
application or study agreement, protocol or procedures for this study, published literature, other 
documentation, or characteristics of a study population. An AE will be considered unexpected if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of the e vent is not consistent with the risk information described.  
8.2.4  T
IME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of the study team via spontaneous report or formal assessment  during month 3 of the 3 -month home monitoring period , where participants will be 
asked to describe any physical or mental health worries/concerns since they began participating in the study . Regardless of the reporting mechanism, the study team will probe any concerns to  get additional 
information and determine if it is an adverse event. Details will be documented in the participant study record.  
 
Any side effects that are determined to be adverse events related to study participation  w
 ill be 
documented on the study adver se event form in the study REDCap database and followed until 
resolution.

Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.[ADDRESS_810917] IRBMED reporting schedule: 
(https://az.research.umich.edu/medschool/guidance/adverse -ev ent-reporting ). The U -M IRBMED 
reporting schedule is dependent on the severity of the event, and whether such adverse events were expected. Any serious adverse events will be reported to U -M IRBMED as soon as possible but not later 
than [ADDRESS_810918] staff meetings. 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
Primary Endpoint:  
1) We hypothesize that this intensive data collection protocol will be both feasible and 
acceptable for care partners (regardless of group assignment)  
a. Feasibility and Acceptability as measured by ≥80% of participants  indicating that 
care partners either ‘Agree’ or ‘Totally Agree’ that the different study elements are feasible and acceptable  
  S
econdary Endpoints:  
2) We hypothesize that this intensive data collection protocol will be both feasible and acceptable for care partners (regardless of group assignment)  
a. Attrition as measured by [CONTACT_611549] (i.e., we 
expect ≥80% of participants to complete the study)  
b. Percent missing data of total expected data for each person and on average will also be calculated to characterize the feasibility of this data collection method (i.e., we expect ≤60% missing data for the daily assessment questions and ≥80% completion rates for the three monthly surveys)  
 
Exploratory  E
 ndpoints:  
1) We hypothesize decreases  from baseline to 3 -months  in caregiver strain  among participants 
in the JITAI group .  
 
2) W e hypothesize decreases from baseline to 3 -months in depression  among participants in 
the JITAI group .  
 
3) W e hypothesize decreases from baseline to 3 -months in anxiety  among participants in the 
JITAI group .  
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.[ADDRESS_810919] based the proposed sample size on 
our previous exp erience conducting these types of trials.  Specifically, we  believe that ~50 participants  
will provide  sufficien t numbers and diagnostic diversity to evaluate  feasibility and  acceptability of new 
mobile health apps. Thus, or sample size of N=60 caregivers (3 0 per arm  and 20 per care partner group ), 
exceeds this estimate and should provide a reasonable range of score s on the HRQOL outcome 
measures to  guide later  phase trial work.   
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
 
The primary endpoint  will examine survey responses on the feasibility and acceptability questionnaire 
that is designed to evaluate our intensive data collection protocol in the full sample (i.e., N=60 care 
partners).  Secondary endpoints will include attrition and adherence estimates (again across the full sample).  Exploratory analyses will be conducted to identify  trend s for an impro vement in HRQOL scores 
(i.e., strain, depression, and anxiety) for care partners that are randomized to the intervention group. These analyses will also  look for a trend for an improvement in the remaining HRQOL scores for care 
partners that are randomized  to the intervention group, and will compare the JITAI group with the 
control group  on all of the different HRQOL measures .  Exploratory  analyses may also compare 
important subgroups (e.g., caregiver groups that differ by [CONTACT_637] [SCI, HD or HCT], relationship type [parent vs. spousal caregivers], caregiver groups that differ by [CONTACT_4321] [male vs. female caregivers], caregiver groups that differ according to the functional status of the person with TBI (e.g., complicated mild vs. moderate vs. severe TBI or per ceived functional status based on Mayo Portland Adaptability Index 
scores). Exploratory analyses will be an intention -to-treat approach where the participant will contribute 
data to the arm he/she was randomized to regardless of the amount of data contribu ted (i.e. the 
duration of participation).  
9.[ADDRESS_810920] deviations (or medians and ranges if 
non-normality is detected), while categorical measures will be summarized with frequencies and 
percentages.  
 
For inferential tests, a two group t -test will be used  to look for trends in the data .

where data distributions are not normal, nonparametric tests will be used to analyze the data.  
9.4.2  A NALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Primary Endpoint :  
• Feasibility & Acceptability Questionnaire : At the 3- month ( 90 day) assessment only, participants 
will complete a Study Feasibility survey to assess the experience of the participant with the 
study methodology and technology, including the CareQOL app , Fitbit® , and the JITAI. I tems are 
scaled from 1 to 5 to indicate level of agreement, where "1" indicates "strong disagree ment" 
and "5" indicates "strong agreement ." Administration time is 5 minutes.  
 F
requency counts for each of the Feasibility and Acceptability  items.  Descriptive statistics will also be 
calculated .   
9.4.3  A NALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Attrition (% of participants completing the final assessment —the assessment that is given at the 
end of month 3)  
• Adherence (%  missing data of total expected data for each person )  
 
Attrition will be reported as the number of participants that complete the final assessment out of the total of number of study participants that completed the baseline assessment. In addition, t he total 
number of days that participants completed EMA assessments, the monthly surveys, and the number of 
participants that complete the study will be calculated. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for missing data across the study period and by [CONTACT_35993]/day.    
9.4.4  B
ASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
 Care partners in each study group (JITAI and control) will be compared descriptively according to 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Guidelines.
8  
 T tests/ANOVA will be used to examine group differences for continuous variables (e.g., age, HRQOL outcomes ).  Chi -squared/Fisher exact tests will be used to examine group differences for categorical 
variables (e.g., caregiver type [SCI, HD, HCT], sex, ethnicity, race, education, marital status, relationship to 
care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] ).

subjects or others. The following criteria must be met:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject(s) or other at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 Unanticipated problems will be reported by a study investigator  to the U -M IRBMED per their standard 
reporting timeline. See: https://az.research.umich.edu/medschool/guidance/unanticipated -p
 roblems -
involving -risks -subjects -or-others  
 
Study staff  will report study -related unanticipated problems  using the unanticipated problem form in the 
REDCap study database . Unanticipated problems  will be discussed at investigator and project staff 
meetings.  
 
Protocol Deviations:  
This protocol uses the U- M IRBMED  definition of a protocol deviation 
(https://az.research.umich.edu/medschool/glossary/deviation ) which d efines a protocol deviation as 
“an incident involving non -compliance with the protocol, but one that does not have a significant effect 
on the subject’s righ ts, safety or welfare, and/or on the integrity of the data. Deviations may result from 
the action of the participant, researcher or staff.”  
 
W
e will follow the U- M IRBMED reporting guidance for protocol deviations found here  
https://az.research.umich.edu/medschool/guidance/other -reportable -information -or-occurrence -orio. 
 Reportable p rotocol deviations will be reported and tracked in the study  REDCap database  and will be 
discussed at investigator and project staff meetings.  
 
The following events w
 ill not be reported  as protocol deviations:  
• A protocol deviation will not be reported for participants who skip/do not complete study survey questions or entire surveys (like end of month assessments or post -intervention surveys). 
Caregiver Well -Being (AS)   Version 5.[ADDRESS_810927] in an 
intensive, long duration protocol like this that participants may miss some assessments.  
• A protocol deviation will not be reported for out -of-window assessments. Use of this data will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_611576]; some analyses may need tighter 
compliance to the assessment window while others will not.  
• A protocol deviation will not be reported for participants who miss/do not complete the EMA 
assessments or do not wear/miss uploading Fitbit ® data during the home -monitoring period. For 
example, we expect that there may be instances where participants are unable to complete the EMA assessments (for example, they are somewhere where it is inconvenient for them to answer) or forget to p ut on or sync the Fitbit ®.  
• A protocol deviation will not be reported for participants who decline the participant payment. 
It has been our experience that some research participants do not wish to receive payment for 
their participation in research studie s.  
 Reportable protocol deviations will be reviewed at the project staff and investigator meetings.

1.1. Synopsis  
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, randomized, double- blind, active controlled study to compare the 
efficacy and safety of ridinilazole (200 mg, bid) for 10 days with vancomycin (125 mg, qid) 
for 10 days in the treatment of Clostridium difficile  infection (CDI).  
Short Title: Comparison of ridinilazole versus vancomycin treatment for CDI 
Rationale: 
Clostridioides difficile  (formerly  Clostridium difficile ) infection  (CDI) is an infection of the colon 
that invariably develops following prior antibiotic use. The disease is associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality and primarily affects the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29834] (>65 years of ag e) although 
CDI is becoming increasingly associated with the community setting and younger age groups. Of concern is recurrent infection with up to 30% of patients experiencing a subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_149486] 65% after a third epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] [1, 2] . Recurrent 
disease remains a central unmet medical need in CDI. It is difficult to treat, associated with increased morbidity and poorer clinical outcomes, and further increased risk of mortality. Summit is developi[INVESTIGATOR_149487] a novel antimicrobial for CDI with the goal of achieving comparable 
cure rates to standard of care and  reducing rates of recurrent disease. A Phase [ADDRESS_172290] of care, demonstrated these attributes.  
The rationale for this Phase 3 study is to demonstrate the improvement in sustained clinical 
response of ridinilazole over vancomycin and compare the safety of ridinilazole to that of 
vancomycin. A second Phase 3 study of identical design will be run in parallel. 
Primary Objective  
• To compare the efficacy of 10 days ’ dosing with ridinilazole (200 mg bid) with 
vancomycin (125 mg qid ) in the treatment of patients with CDI 
Secondary Objectives  
• To compare the safety and tolerability of 10 days ’ dosing with ridinilazole (200 mg bid )

Overall Design: 
A multicenter, randomized, double blind, active controlled, parallel group pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study 
designed to investigate the use of ridinilazole 200  mg bis in die ( bid), in compar ison to vancomycin 
125 mg quarter in die (qid), both administered for [ADDRESS_172295] the presence of toxin A and/or B of C. difficile  in the 
stool as confirmed by a positive free toxin test a nd not have had more than one prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_149489] [ADDRESS_172296] appropriate regulatory approvals 
(FDA approval, EU CE Mark or equivalent). Refer to Section  10.[ADDRESS_172297] of the

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  17 of 94 study will also be suitable for use with  Sponsor approval . Free t oxin tests will be provided for the 
site/site laboratory use if a suitable test is not available locally.  In case of a negative free toxin  test 
result at a suspected recurrence, detection of C. difficile  toxin in samples  will be performed by [CONTACT_149533] a central l aboratory . 
The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ridinilazole compared with vancomycin. 
Ridinilazole systemic exposure will be evaluated in a subset of patients at selected sites. The effect of the two treatments on the gut  microbiome and bile acid composition will be evaluated in patients 
across all sites.  The study will also inve stigate the  antibiotic susceptibility and ribotype of 
C. difficile  isolates collected at different time points and assess the impact of ridinilazole on quality 
of life and health economic measures.  
Number of Patient s: 
The original planned sample size was approximate ly 680 patients  (340 patients per arm ) to be 
randomly assigned to study treatment.  To minimize the potential, unknown impact  of the  
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic  on the trial and because of a much slower  
enrollment rate than anticipated  due to the ongoing pandemic , Summit has  decided  to combine its 
ongoing, Phase 3 studies , SMT19969/ C004 and SMT19969/ C005, into one study with a pre -
specified Statistical Analysis Plan when these blinded, identical studies are at least half enrolled . 
As a result, both studies will be closed and will proceed with database lock and statistical analysis.  
The combined analysis will comprise a minimum of 680  randomized subjects.  
To ensure optimal data quality and integrity, it is critical that 
• Inclusion and exclusion criteria are rigorously adhered to.  
• Diagnosis of CDI is always determined by a positive, Sponsor approved, free toxin 
test prior to randomization.  
• A free toxin test must be completed if recurrence of CDI is suspected. Refer to the 
result of the free toxin test to determine whether CDI treatment is required.  
• 
For all suspected recurrences associated with a negative free toxin test result 
obtained locally by [CONTACT_779], a stool sample aliquot  should be prepared  for testing 
by [CONTACT_149534] a central laboratory.  
• Patients take all study treatment as directed and complete the 10 days of treatment.  
• Patients report all study medication doses for the 10 days of treatment.  
• Patients report all bowel movements every day up to Day 12/ AOC and  all UBMs to 
Day 40.  
Potentially confounding medications (i.e., those affecting disease progression) are avoided 
wherever possible.  
Treatment Groups and Duration:  
Each patient will be enrolled in this study for approximately 100 days. This consists of a 0 to 3-day screening period, a 10- day treatment period and a 90- day follow -up period (including an 
assessment of cure at Day 12).  
Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either a 10- day course of ridinilazole (200 mg, bid) or 
a 10- day course of vancomycin (125 mg, qid).

2.1. Introduction 
Ridinilazole is a novel antimicrobial that is being developed for treating C. difficile  infection (CDI) 
and reducing the recurrence of CDI [3]. Ridinilazole is associated with a highly  targeted spectrum 
of activity that has been shown to result in minimal collateral impact on the gut microbiota during 
therapy and it is expected that this property will lead to reduced rates of CDI recurrence  and 
improved sustained clinical response. This was demonstrated in a Phase 2 proof  of concept study 
where treatment with ridinilazole demonstrated superior efficacy compared with vancomycin, demonstrated by a marked reduction in rates of CDI recurrence and hence improved sustained cure rates [4]. 
Nonclinical and prior clinical studies have shown that ridinilazole is retained in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract following oral dosing, therefore maximizing exposure of ridinilazole at the site of infection and minimizing systemic exposure. A  detai led description of the chemistry, 
pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ridinilazole is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
C. difficile  is an anaerobic Gram -positive spore -forming species of bacteria which is responsible 
for epi[INVESTIGATOR_149490], with symptoms ranging from mild, self -limiting 
diarrhea to more severe and potentially life -threatening manifestations such as pseudomembranous 
colitis and toxic megacolon [5]. C. difficile  can often be a harmless resident of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with levels typi[INVESTIGATOR_149491]. However, disruption to the healthy ecological balance of the gut  microbiota, typi[INVESTIGATOR_149492], diminishes the ability of the host to resist colonization by C. difficile  spores 
that can undergo germination, leading to toxin production and disease symptoms [6, 7].  
Recurrence of CDI occurs in up to 30% of patients following initial therapy, hence the prevention 
of recurrent disease remains a key unmet medical need in the managem ent of CDI [1] . Each 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_149493] a significant burden on patients through increased morbidity and diminished quality of life. In a study of [ADDRESS_172310] one recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the risk of subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_149494] 45% [8]. Recurrence rates may be > 65% following a 3rd epi[INVESTIGATOR_149495] [2, 9] . 
Treatment of recurrent CDI is challenging and there is no uniformly effective therapeutic approach.  
While administration of standard CDI antibiotics (vancomycin or metronidazole) may result in a 
reduction in C. difficile  and subsequent relief of symptoms, they have been shown to have ongoing 
and deleterious effects to the gut microbiota [10-12] . As such, repeated courses of treatment for 
CDI may exacerbate the situation with the ongoing suppression of the microbiota leaving patients prone to further epi[INVESTIGATOR_149496]. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that allow natural restoration of a healthy  gut microbiome and resistanc e to C. difficile  colonization, especially with narrow 
spectrum C. difficile -targeted antibiotics, are expected to reduce rates of recurrent disease and 
improve sustained  clinical response [5, 6].

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  24 of 94 2.2. Background 
CDI is an infection of the colon that typi[INVESTIGATOR_149497]. The disease 
is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and primarily affects the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29834] 
(>65 years of age), although CDI is becoming increasi ngly associated with the community setting.  
Of particular concern is recurrent infection with up to 30% of patients experiencing a subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_149498], with rates increasing to 65% after a third epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Prevention of recurrent disease remains a central unmet medical need in CDI as it is difficult to treat, associated with increased morbidity and poorer clinical outcomes, and further increased risk of mortality.  
A recent EU wide survey of 1,047 healthcare professionals involved in the management of CDI,  [13] revealed a high level of agreement (97.3% and 90.7%, respectively) with the statements 
that “recurrent CDI is a strong contributor to poor clinical outcomes, increased length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149499]” and that “treatment decisions for both initial infection and recurrent CDI should take into account the impact on resource utilization a nd wider societal costs.”.  
Therefore, the optimal strategy in CDI therapy is to achieve high levels of clinical response at the end of therapy and to minimize rates of recurrent disease such that the initial clinical response a t 
the end of dosing is sustained for a period of time following the EOT. 
Current treatment options are limited and of sub -optimal efficacy. Oral vancomycin and 
metronidazole are the current mainstay antibiotics and both are associated with high rates of 
recurrent disease [14]. The most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America ( IDSA) guidelines 
state metronidazole is only recommended in settings where access to vancomycin or fidaxomicin is limited, and then only for initial cases of non-s evere CDI. Vancomycin and fidaxomicin are 
recommended for initial CDI.  [15-17] . There is evidence that metronidazole is associated with 
inferior clinical response at end of therapy compared to vancomycin across all disease severities [18, 19] and may be associated with higher 30 day all –cause mortality rates in subjects with severe 
CDI [20]. Response to metronidazole treatment in the frail and elderly is generally slow, with 
patients prone to recurrence; 30 -day-mortality of 21% has been reported after tr eatment with 
metronidazole [21]. Oral vancomycin remains the currently recognized standard of care  and, based 
on recent clinical trial experience, is typi[INVESTIGATOR_149500] 80 -90% based 
on recent Phase 3 clinical trials [22- 24]. Given vancomycin may be used in both severe and non-
severe CDI, is associated with higher clinical response rates and faster symptomatic resolution when compared with metronidazole and is generally considered the standard of care in CDI it will 
be the acti ve comparator for this study. A description of oral vancomycin’s efficacy, safety and 
pharmacology can be found in the Prescribing Information (FDA Reference ID: 3058238). 
Fidaxomicin is approved in the US and EU for the treatment of CDI and has seen limit ed routine 
use in clinical practice. Fidaxomicin has been shown in Phase [ADDRESS_172311] end of  therapy, although fidaxomicin was not 
shown to be superior to vancomycin for SCR for the subgroup of patients infected with BI/NAP 1/027 strains of C. difficile [22, 23]. ESCMID treatment guidelines give equal recommendation 
(Quality of Evidence = II; Strength of Recommendation = B) on the use of fidaxomicin and 
vancomycin in the treatment of a f irst epi[INVESTIGATOR_149501] -threatening disease. In treatment of first recurrence, both

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  25 of 94 vancomycin and fidaxomicin receive an equal recommendation strength (B -I). Only in the 
treatment of multiple recurrences do ESCMID recommend fidaxomicin or taper/pulsed 
vancomycin regimens over a standard regimen of vancomycin (B-II vs. C- II respectively).   
New antibiotic treatments, such as ridinilazole, that can treat the initial infection and minimize the 
subsequent risk of recurrent infection are needed.  
A Phase 2 randomized, double -blind study (SMT19969/C002) conducted in 100 patients with CDI 
comparing the safety and efficacy of ridinilazole 200 mg bis in die (bid)  for 10 days versus the 
approved dose of vancomycin 125 mg quarter in die ( qid) in the treatment of CDI has been 
completed [4]. The primary endpoint used was sustained clinical response, defined as clinical cure 
at test of cure (TOC) and no recurrence of CDI  within [ADDRESS_172312] of cure (TOC). The primary  
analysis population was a modified Intent to Treat (ITT) population comprising patients (36 
ridinilazole; 33 vancomycin) whose diagnosis was confirmed by [CONTACT_149539]. In the mITT population, SCR rates were 24/36 (66.7%) and 14/33 (42.4%) for patients on ridinilazole and vancomycin, respectively. The difference between treatment proportions was 21.1% with a 90% CI (3.1%, 39.1%), which showed ridinilazole was non- inferior to vancomycin 
(15% non- inferiority margin; p = 0.0004). Furthermore, as the 90% confidence interval lies 
entirely above zero it was concluded ridinilazole was superior to vancomycin at the pre -specified 
10% level of significance ([ADDRESS_172313]). Clinical response at TOC was 28/36 (77.8%) and 23/33 
(69.7%) for patients on ridinilazole and vancomycin, respectively (mITT population). The difference between treatment proportions was 8.3% (90% CI −9·3, 25·8), demonstrating non-inferiority (pre -specified 15% margin) on initial cure. In addition, the study showed that 
ridinila zole was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile comparable to that of vancomycin. 
In the safety population (all treated patients), 82% (41/50) and 80% (40/50) in the ridinilazole and vancomycin groups, respectively, reported adverse events, while 16% (8/50) and 18% (9/50) of patients in the respective groups reported serious adverse events. There were no study drug- related 
adverse events that led to discontinuation in the ridinilazole group. Full details of the study results are provided in the Inves tigators Brochure.  
An exploratory Phase 2, multi -centre, open- label, randomised, active -controlled, parallel -group 
study (SMT19969/C003) was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 10 days of dosing 
with ridinilazole (200 mg BID) compared with fidaxomicin (200 mg BID). Secondary objectives 
included efficacy of ridinilazole compared with fidaxomicin as determined by [CONTACT_149540] [ADDRESS_172314] of the two agents on the gut microbiota. A total of 27 patients (14 ridinilazole: 13 fidaxom icin) were 
randomised to study treatment and all were included in the safety and primary efficacy analysis populations. Overall, ridinilazole was considered safe and generally well tolerated. All patients in the safety population, except two patients in the fidaxomicin group, experienced TEAEs. The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity and resolved without treatment and there were no discontinuations due to TEAEs. Sustained clinical response was comparable between the ridinilazole group (50.0%) and the fidaxomicin group (46.2%) with an overall treatment difference of 2.9%  (95%  CI: -30.8%, 36.7%). The ridinilazole group had a higher proportion of patients with 
risk factors for CDI recurrence than fidaxomicin including concomitant antibacterial use, severe disease,  and age ≥65 years. Analysis of the microbiome of the patients showed that ridinilazole

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-[ADDRESS_172315] of care. A second Phase 3 study of identical design will be run in parallel.  
This Phase 3 study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_149502] 200  mg bid, as 
a 10- day therapy, in comparison with the approved dose and duration of vancomycin (125 mg 
[qid] given for 10 days) for the treatme nt of CDI. The study will evaluate the efficacy of 
ridinilazole compared with vancomycin in terms of Sustained Clinical Response (SCR) defined as 
Clinical Response and no recurrence of infection with C. difficile  through [ADDRESS_172316] end of 
treatment (EOT). The efficacy of ridinilazole will also be compared with vancomycin with respect to Clinical Response, and SCR through 60- and 90-days post EOT. Safety and tolerability of 
ridinilazole will be compared with vancomycin, as well as various health economic m easures. The 
study will also investigate the antibiotic  susceptibility and ribotype of C. difficile  isolates collected 
at different time points and assess the effect of the two treatments on the gut  microbiome and bile 
acid composition . Ridinilazole plasma concentration will be assessed in a subset of patients.  
Oral vancomycin has been selected as a comparator as it is the current standard of care for the treatment of CDI and is generally recommended for use in the treatment of moderate to severe CDI, in treatment of a first recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_149503] [16, 21] .Vancomycin therapy is associated with increased rates of clinical response, faster 
resolution of diarrhea [21] and other symptoms and reduced rates of recurrent disease when 
compared to metronidazole for all dis ease severities [19] . Although higher doses are routinely used 
clinically, the recommended clinical dose of oral vancomycin is 125mg four times daily. In addition, recent studies have shown high dose regimens of vanc omycin are no more effective that 
standard dose regimens [25]. Vancomycin remains the standard active comparator used in clinical 
trials of novel agents. As such, Summit will use [ADDRESS_172317] -dose samples, at 2 and 4 hours,  will be collected on Day 1 or 2, and at EOT. As the study

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-[ADDRESS_172318] received ridinilazole. Some of these patients are expected to meet the IDSA criteria 
for severe CDI (white blood cell count ≥15,000 cells/mm3 or serum creatinine >1.5  mg/dL). In 
order to assess the systemic exposure of ridinilazole in patients with severe CDI, t he number of 
patients with severe CDI in the PK subgroup will be monitored, and additional PK patients  may 
be enrolled as required.   
2.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
Ridinilazole is a novel antibiotic being developed for the treatment of CDI and  reducing the 
recurrence of CDI. Ridinilazole has been shown to demonstrate potent growth inhibition with a narrow minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range against a broad range of C. difficile  
ribotypes collected from both the US and Europe. This range includes hyper virulent ribotypes such as 027 and isolates showing reduced susceptib ility to vancomycin and metronidazole. 
Importantly, ridinilazole has a narrow spectrum of activity with typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] > 1,000- fold selectivity 
for C. difficile  over Gram -positive and Gram -negative anaerobic and facultative members of the 
gut microbiota. This feature of ridinilazole has been shown to result in minimal collateral damage to the gut microbiota [26 ] compared with vancomycin, throughout the course of treatment of CDI 
during a Phase 2 clinical trial and ultimately led to a marked reduction in rates of recurrent CDI.  
Therefore, this study will use a similar design to the Phase 2 study to provide confirmatory evidence of ridinilazole’s effect on CDI recurrence of infection. The primary endpoint of SCR is the most appropriate measure of efficacy for comparison to vancomycin since it captures both cure of the initial infection and any onset of CDI recurrence. An important aspect of the design is that the randomized population will have a diagnosis of CDI confirmed by [CONTACT_149541] (and not colonization) in accordance with treatment guidelines [16, 27 ]. 
2.5. Justification for Dose  
In the Phase 2 clinical trials of ridinilazole a single dose of 200mg bid for 10 days was assessed. 
The dose was selected based on known effective gut concentrations of drug from animal models and from fecal concentrations established during Phase 1 clinic al trials.  
As recognized in guidelines the use of PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses do not assist in the prediction of an effective dose for oral agents intended to act locally within the gut lumen and this has been clearly demonstrated for other GI restricted antibiotics where no correlation between baseline MIC values, fecal concentrations and outcome could be demonstrated. Previous CDI antibiotic studies which varied the daily drug exposure generally failed to demonstrate any significant dose response tr eatment effect [28-30]. In addition, it has recently been shown that 
there is no significant improvement in rates of clinical improvement at end of therapy with high dose vancomycin regimens when compared to standard dose regim ens [ 25]. 
In the Phase 2 study, 50 patients were administered ridinilazole 200 mg bid for 10 days for 
treatment of CDI. The dose was shown to be safe and well -tolerated and demonstrated sup eriority 
in sustained clinical response over vancomycin at the 10% level of significance ( 2-sided  test). 
Furthermore, at this dose there was negligible systemic exposure of ridinilazole with mean (SD) plasma concentrations of 0.06 (0.11), 0.16 (0.26), and 0.18 (0.22) ng/mL at nominal [ADDRESS_172319] on systemic 
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-[ADDRESS_172320] ug (Day 10 mean = 1,373 µg/g) were significantly above the MIC 90 value 
of 0.125 µg/mL for C. difficile.  
Based on these results and the acceptable safety and tolerability profile seen in both the Phase 1 
and Phase 2 studies the same dose will be used in thi s larger Phase 3 study.  
As per IDSA guidelines, vancomycin 125 mg qid over 10 days is recommended  therapy option for 
all severities of CDI .  
2.6. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
In 28- day oral toxicity studies in rats and dogs up to ridinilazole 1000 mg/kg/day no adverse study 
findings were seen with associated plasma levels below the LLOQ. Assessment of the systemic toxicity of ridinilazole for 28 days by [CONTACT_941] i.v. route in the rat and the dog identified the liver, lungs 
(findings possibly caused by [CONTACT_149542][INVESTIGATOR_149504]), spleen and kidneys (rat only), thymus and gall bladder (dog only) as target organs from 
a dose -level of ridinilazole 0.5  mg/kg/day. The associated ridinilazole plasma levels were several 
hundred- fold higher than the plasma levels observed in humans so far.  
In a Phase [ADDRESS_172321] frequent drug -related AEs were classified as GI disorders: diarrhea and abdominal distension/pain.  
In Phase 2 studies a total of 64 patients (SMT19969/ C002 50 patients; SMT19969/C003 
14 patients) received ridinilazole [ADDRESS_172322] frequent AEs were GI related. The safety profile of ridinilazole in the 
SMT19969/C002 study was comparable to the  comparator, vancomycin, which will be used in this 
proposed study. 
In the SMT19969/C002 Phase 2 study in patients with CDI ridinilazole was shown to be superior 
at the pre -specified 10% level of significance ([ADDRESS_172323]) over standard of care vancomycin  with 
respect to its primary endpoint of SCR and non- inferior with respect to its key secondary endpoint 
at AOC. In the SMT19969/C003 study ridinilazole displayed comparable clinical efficacy to 
fidaxomicin on sustained clinical response (SCR).  
In both Phase 2 clinical studies the plasma concentrations of ridinilazole were either below or close 
to the LLOQ, with a maximum systemic concentration of 1.31 ng/mL across all patients and 
assessment days. Therefore, GI related local tolerability AEs can be expect ed to be the main safety 
risks for ridinilazole.  
Together with pre -clinical data showing ridinilazole has a narrow spectrum activity against 
C. difficile  and microbiome sparing properties, these clinical data provide a positive risk -benefit 
profile for patients in this study. Safety procedures during this clinical trial consist of vital signs, physical examinations, and laboratory assessments.  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events of  ridinilazole may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure  including the 
Reference Safety Information (RSI). A risk assessment for vancomycin can be found in the SPC/package insert.

4.1. Patient Enrolment and Overall Design  
SMT19969/C004 is a Phase 3 randomized, double -blind, active controlled, parallel group, multi -
center study to compare the efficacy of 10 days’ dosing with ridinilazole 200 mg bid with 
vancomycin 125 mg qid  in the treatment of patients with CDI. Approximately 680 patients 
(340 per arm) with a confirmed diagnosis of CDI will be enrolled in the study.  
It comprises a screening visit, a 10 -day treatment period (beginning on the day of screening or the 
following day) and a 90-day follow-up period. 
Due to the acute nature of CDI and typi[INVESTIGATOR_149506]/D1 assessments will be conducted on the same day but, the screening visit can be conducted within 3 days prior to the baseline /D1 visit if required for practical 
reasons. In addition, protocol v.6.0 introduces the option for all study visits to be conducted 
remotely  due to the COVID- 19 public health emergency. However, patients should continue to 
attend in -clinic visits  whenever possible or as required .
 All assessments should be completed prior 
to randomization except for the following:  
• May be conducted after randomization but prior to 1st dose: weight, hematology and clinical chemistry samples, stool collection, eDiary  training, EQ -5D- 5L, Cdiff32 and 
medical utilization questions.  
• In a subset of patients, samples for PK analysis must be obtained  (refer to Section  8.5)
. 
Randomization will occur after confirmation of eligibility is established  with reference to the 
protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria . Patients will be randomized to receive ridinilazole  or 
vancomycin in a 1:1 fashion. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654]  (<65 years and ≥65 years) , 
number of UBMs (<10 or ≥10) in the 24 hours prior to randomization, immunocompromised 
(YES/NO),  and history of recurrent CDI  (either none or [ADDRESS_172329] 
12 months). Dosing with study treatment starts on Day 1 following randomization. Further visits 
will be scheduled at Day 10 (EOT), 12 (AOC), 40 (SCR), 70 (SCR) and 100 (SCR). A telephone check will be conducted at Day 5. Day 10 and Day 70 assessments may be conducted by [CONTACT_149544]/convenience although arrangements will be required for patient drop -
off or site collection of a stool sample.  The AOC visit will be conducted on Day 13 if the patient's 
10 days’ dosing is completed on Day 11.  
Patients will report dosing information to EOT and bowel movements daily up to Day 40, to 
support the primary endpoint analyses. Weekly contact [CONTACT_149545] 40 
until study completion to check for di arrhea/suspected recurrence. Investigators or designee will 
take measures to  ensure patients are compliant with reporting diarrhea/suspected recurrence during 
the study.  
An assessment of suspected recurrence visit will occur for each suspected recurrence (≥ 3UBMs 
in one day, after assessment of cure or resolution of previous recurrence). 
Unscheduled visits may occur at the Investigator’s discretion (e.g. in the case of AEs) . 
Additionally,  patients should be requested to attend an in- clinic visit in the event of suspected 
recurrence of CDI.  If they have a suspected recurrence and are not able to visit the clinic, this visit

screening/baseline visits should be conducted in -person at the clinic. Below are modifications to 
the protocol when remote assessments are necessary to protect patients, site personnel, or community safety, or to respond to COVID-19- related public health measures.   
For study visits that must be conducted remotely, and where the patient is not residing at home, 
investigative site staff or home healthcare vendor with proper delegation and training may see 
patients at an alter native location (s) where they have the privileg es to do so, as permitted by [CONTACT_149546].  Informed Consent is allowed in other than face to face method as per site local 
procedure or local regulations . This may include electronic signature [INVESTIGATOR_1660] e -Consent if already in 
place and used at the site . Consent for m(s) must be received and acknowledged by [CONTACT_149547]. O riginal, signed  consent form(s) must be returned to 
the site either at the next in -clinic visit, posted to the site , or returned via courier or any other 
approved alternate method.  
The st ool sample may be couriered to the site. 
A sponsor contracted home healthcare vendor or appropriately trained and delegated site staff may 
conduct remote visit at the patient’s home or alternate agreed on loc ation .  
The patient may take their own vital signs using their vital signs machine if they already have one 
or one that is provided to them (where available). The physical exam and vital  signs when taken 
by [CONTACT_102], ‘ signs and symptoms of CDI ’ assessments must be done via sponsor approved video 
conferencing between the Investigator and the patient .  
Following Investigator assessment of eligibility and randomization, eDiaries C-diff 32 
questionnaire (where applicable) and IMP should be provided directly to the patient (shipped by 
[CONTACT_30367], provided by [CONTACT_149548][INVESTIGATOR_149507]). 
Used IMP wallets and any unused medication should be returned to the site, either during the next  
in-clinic visit or shipped  or couriered to site.

12. Patients that the Investigator feels are inappropriate for the study:   
a. patients with any condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, would make the 
patient unsuitable for inclusion in the study , such as chronic diarrhea, vomiting that 
cannot be managed with anti -emetics, inability to swallow study medication, or 
medically unstable with critical illness (e.g. requiring vasopressors, intubation, etc.).  
b. patients who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], are not likely to complete the study, 
e.g. life expectancy  less than 100 days .  
c. patients with known hypersensitivity or intolerance to ridinilazole, vancomycin, 
and/or their excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
d. patients or their caregivers who are unable to comply with protocol requirements, e.g. 
attend study visits,  report bowel movements and suspected recurrence,  provide  stool  
samples or undergo blood draws.  
Note:  Investigators are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_149549].  
5.3. Lifestyle Considerations  
There are not any lifestyle restrictions applicable through the study.  
5.3.1. Meals and Dietary Restrictions  
No meal or dietary restrictions.  
5.3.2. Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco 
No caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco restrictions.  
5.3.3. Activity  
No activity restrictions.  
5.4. Screen Failures 
Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in any of the clinical study 
assessments but are not subsequently randomized into the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure patients to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Tri als (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond 
to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure reasons and any serious adverse event (SAE).  
It is possible for patients to be rescreened once for this stu dy. If a patient is rescreened a new 
patient number will be assigned.

Patients will take one dose (one tablet and one  capsule) four times a day for 10 days (40 doses). 
It is important that patients : 
• Are instructed to complete the full 10 -day course of IMP in order to fully evaluate efficacy . 
• Take doses strictly in numerical order to ensure correct timing of active vs pla cebo  
o Must only remove one dose at a time (one tablet and one capsule) from the 
provided wallet. Removing multiple doses from the wallet is not permitted.  
• Do not c rush or break the tablets or open  the capsules (e.g. to pass through a feeding tube) . 
Study treatment will be provided in a blister wallet labeled per country requirements. Each wallet 
will have a unique identifier which will be used to allocate double -blind study treatment to each 
patient via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) syste m. Each wallet will contain all doses 
required for the total treatment period (40 doses over 10 days). Doses will be clearly labeled 1 to 40 on the wallets. It is important the patient takes each dose in order number starting with 1 and finishing with 40. If a patient misses  a dose, they should be instructed to take the missed dose 
before or with the next dose. No more than 2 doses should be taken at any one time. For example, if Dose 3 is missed, take Dose 3 before or with Dose 4 .  
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Sto rage/Accountability  
The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions (below 25°C and 
not refrigerated or frozen ) have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received 
and any product complaints or discrepancies ar e reported and resolved before use of the study 
treatment.  
Only patients enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site staff may 
supply or administer study treatment (as documented by [CONTACT_149550]). All study treatment must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and 
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  39 of 94 monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with 
access limited to the Investigator and authorized site staff.  
Any product  complaints or storage temperature excursions identified during storage of 
investigational product should be reported to the Sponsor and resolved prior to use. 
The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is resp onsible 
for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e., receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
The Investigator or Pharmacist should arrange for destruction of any unused IMP following full 
reconciliation  of IMP and Sponsor (or delegate) approval. Destruction will be conducted locally 
where possible using a method in line with Sponsor provided requirements. Destruction should be conducted per the sites standard operating procedure (SOP) and a destruction c ertificate, including 
method of destruction, should be issued. IMP may be returned to the Sponsor if local destruction is not possible. 
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatments are provided 
in the Investigator T rial Site File .  
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
Randomization will occur on Day 1 after eligibility for the study has been confirmed.  Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to either the ridinilazole 
arm or the vancomycin arm.   
The Investigator or designee will use the IRT system to randomize a patient.   
A computer -generated central randomization will be used which will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] 
(<65 years and ≥65 years) , number of UBMs (<10 or  ≥10) in the 24 hours prior to randomization , 
immunocompromised (YES/NO), and history of recurrent CDI (either none or [ADDRESS_172340] 12 months). Once a randomization number has been assigned it will not be 
re-assigned. 
Study treatment will be dispensed at the randomization visit (Day 1) as summarized in SoA (Section  1.3). Returned study treatment should not be re -dispensed to patients. 
This is a double -blind study. To maintain the blind, a double -dummy approach for study treatment 
will be employed. Vancomycin will be encapsulated within a Size [ADDRESS_172341] that patients and study site staff will not know to which arm a patient has been assigned.  
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-[ADDRESS_172342] adverse events can 
be managed without unblinding. If the Investigator believes unblinding is necessary to manage a patie nt, then e mergency unblinding may be conducted via the IRT system but  should only be 
performed when knowledge of the treatment is essential  for medical decisions and/or further 
emergency management of the patient.  
In case of an emergency, the Investigator (whe never possible) is responsible for determining if 
unblinding is warranted. Patient safety must always be the first consideration.  
If unblinding is determined to be warranted, the Investigator should make every effort to contact 
[CONTACT_149551], unless this could delay emergency treatment of the 
patient.  
If unblinding occurs, the Sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_172343] the time and date they 
take each dose.  
Compliance with the study treatment and documentatio n of dosing and bowel movements 
is critical to the integrity of the primary endpoint.  
To help ensure compliance the Investigator will discuss compliance  with the patient:  
• At Day 5 to ensure the treatment is being administered per protocol and to remind the patient to continue to complete all doses regardless of resolution of symptoms.  
• If records indicate that the patient has not been reporting 
dosing and/or bowel 
movements as required . 
The eDiary will be programmed with reminders for patients to take the medication and to 
complete their eDiary daily  until D40 . 
The patient will be required to return all empty packaging and unused study medication to the Investigator at the Day 12 (AOC) visit so that a final compliance check can be conducted.  If the 
patient is unable to attend in -clinic visits it may be shipped or couriered to the site.  
In the event of overdose see Section  8.4.

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  41 of 94 6.5. Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy is any medication, vaccine, procedure or therapy (including over -the- counter 
or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the patient is receiving at the 
time of enrollment or receives during the study.  
All concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_149511] 4 weeks prior to randomization and throughout the study up to D100 (see Section  6.5.1). The reason for use, dates of administration and dosing 
information should be recorded in the CRF . 
6.5.1. Potential Confounding Medications  
Refer to Table  2A and B below for a list of medications that may impact CDI status and hence 
have the potential to confound study results. Control over administration of these medica tions is 
necessary, considering the primary endpoint of the study, but it is understood that a medication should not be withheld for purposes of the study if an alternative and comparable treatment cannot be provided and the patient’s health would otherwise be compromised. 
Potentially Confounding M edications:  
Medications that could potentially confound data analysis should be avoided if possible,  
without compromising the care of the patient.   
If antimicrobial therapy is required for infections other than t hose due to C. difficile , 
antimicrobials without activity/efficacy against C. difficile  should be prescribed ,  
Confounding medications include, but are not limited to , these listed in the following table.

Any potential confounding medications taken 4 weeks prior to randomization should be recorded 
in the CRF  along with any potential confounding medications started, stopped, or changed during 
the study (up to Day 100). 
During the study both the treatment period and follow up period, patients who take any 
confounding medications should not necessarily be discontinued from study treatment and should not be withdrawn from the study.  
Investigators should contact [CONTACT_149554].

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  45 of 94 7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY TREATMENT AND 
WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY  
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
A patient will discontinue study treatment for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of consent to continue taking treatment. The reason for this will be documented if provided. 
• The study Investigator or Sponsor, for any reason, decides the patient should be discontinued from the treatment.  
• Adverse eve nts, classed as possibly or probably study drug-related by [CONTACT_737], 
which cannot be tolerated by [CONTACT_102]. 
• Pregnancy during the treatment period. See Section  10.4 and Section  8.3.5 Pregnancy. 
If a patient is discontinued from treatment,  they should continue with all study visits and 
assessments so that data can be collected. If patients will not agree to this then they should 
complete early termination assessments and return the study treatment wallet.  
See the S oA (Section  1.3) for data to be collected at the time of study treatment discontinuation 
and early termination of follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  
Study drug assigned to the discontinued patient must not be assigned to another patient. 
7.2. Patient Withdrawal from the Study  
All patients are encouraged to continue through to the end of the study at Day 100 even if they 
discontinue from study treatment early. However, a  patient may withdraw from the study at any 
time at his/her own request or  may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator 
for safety, behavioural, compliance, or administrative reasons. 
If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and 
continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a pa tient withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.  
See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of study withdrawal and follow -up and for any 
further evaluations that need to be completed. The reason for withdrawal is to be documented on 
the CRF  and in the source document.  
7.3. Lost to Follow Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].  
The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_149555]/or should continue in the study. 
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  46 of 94 • Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address  or local equivalent methods). 
These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study.

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  47 of 94 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA ( Section  1.3). 
Protocol waivers or exemptions will not be granted by [CONTACT_51853].  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the patient should continue or discontinue study treatment.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA (Section  1.3), is essential and required for study conduct. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
patients meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator or study team designee will maintain 
a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
8.1. Efficacy As sessments  
8.1.1. Patient Reporting of Diarrhea/Suspected Recurrence  
Patients should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_149556]  (≥ 3UBMs per day for at 
least 1 day). 
Additionally, patients will report dosing information daily until EOT and bowel movement 
information daily  until D40. A fter D40 the site will contact [CONTACT_149557][INVESTIGATOR_119999]/ suspected recurrence.  
Patients will be asked to report the following:  
• Date and time of each dose of study medication  to EOT . 
• Date, time,  and consistency (using the Bristol Stool Chart) of all bowel movements up to 
Day 12/AOC.  
• Date, time,  and consistency of all unformed bowel movements (UBMs) through Day 40. 
• During weekly contacts with the patient  after Day 40 and through D ay 100, any epi[INVESTIGATOR_149513] ≥[ADDRESS_172346].  
Able  patients will be provided with an electronic diary (eDiary) to report this information  up to 
Day 40. Adequate time should be allocated to ensure that the patient understands how to complete 
the eDiary and is willing and able to do so every day up to and including Day 40 (at least [ADDRESS_172347] dose of study treatment). The site should conta ct the patient to collect this 
information if use of an eDiary is not possible.  
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  48 of 94 Patient Reported Bowel Movement Data  
• Assessment of response to study  treatment and identification of all epi[INVESTIGATOR_149514] .  
• It is critical that the Investigator and patient understands that accurate, complete,  
and contemporaneous data is  required to meet the study primary objective.  
• It is specifically important to ensure  each patient  provides this information every 
day to Day 40 (at least [ADDRESS_172348] dose of study treatment) . 
• Following Day [ADDRESS_172349] the patient weekly to ask about potential  
diarrhea and assess for suspected recurrence as required.  
Reported information on bowel movements  will be used by [CONTACT_149558] a 
suspected recurrence of CDI requires assessment.  The Investigator or designee will be required to 
monitor the patient’s unformed bowel movement (UBMs)  and assess any  suspected recurrence of 
CDI.  
Suspected Recurrence:  
After the patient was deemed cured , if ≥[ADDRESS_172350] is not 
conducted, the reason should be recorded in the CRF  along with a determination of whether 
recurrence of CDI was suspected.  
Changes to eD iary Data: 
For data collected via an eDiary, data changes are not permitted. Changes to eDiary data will be 
limited to administrative corrections such as erroneous patient number, visit date, patient status, 
timestamps and elimination of duplicate data or merging of data sets for the same patient.  
Patient reported eDiary errors will be reported in the CRF  describing  the error and the correct 
information .  
eDiary Programmed Alerts:  
For data collected via an eDiary, Investigators will be alerted if a daily eDiary completion is 
missed. In these cases, the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_102], within 72h of the day missed, to determine if any UBMs occurred. This information will be documented in the CRF .  
Care Provider  Support:  
The preference is that patients enter their own data into the eDiary  directly . However, it is expected 
that some p atients will have difficulty completing the eDiary . Such patients  may be supported by 
a care provider  entering the data into the eDi ary on behalf of the patient . This is permitted if the 
Investigator is confident that the support provided is adequate to ensure accurate entries into the eDiary on the patient’s behalf. The Investigator must document agreement for a care provider to enter  information into the eDiary on behalf of the patient and the rationale. The care provider must 
only enter information into the eDiary using a unique user ID and PIN  following training .  
A care provider will not complete the EQ -5D on behalf of the patient.  
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  49 of 94 Alternative to the eDiary: 
The CDI patient population is frequently comorbid, elderly, and reliant on family members. For 
patients that are unable to complete the eDiary, and w here the care provider option is not possible, 
an alternative to completion of the eDiary  can be utilized. 
The Investigator /site staff  or delegate  will contact [CONTACT_149559]. A detailed report of the contact [CONTACT_149560], contact [CONTACT_4317], details of dosing and bowel movement 
information since the last contact. Details of dosing and bowel movement will be entered into the CRF . If an Investigator chose this method of collection the site a nd patient must be willing to make 
every effort to report this  daily. Exceptions may be made (if necessary) over the weekend/national 
holidays. Sites are expected to make all efforts to have adequate holiday and vacation coverage to 
ensure information is c ollected within 72h of the event. In general  information collected >72h after 
the event  will be considered missing data for that day  unless there is adequate supporting 
documentation to confirm the data (especially for the date and time of each BM) . 
Where feasible (available and with applicable local regulatory approvals) , a second alternative to 
the eDiary will be made available. S ites may use a [ADDRESS_172351] party vendor, the Investigator is still responsible for ensuring any 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] ≥[ADDRESS_172352] the pat ient’s current signs and symptoms of CDI at baseline/D1 
and at the Day 12/AOC visit. Current signs and symptoms will also be recorded during an assessment of suspected recurrence. The i nvestigator should ask the patient for signs and 
symptoms that have occurred over the 1-day period prior to assessment.  
Suspected recurrence: if there is no recurrence of CDI per the protocol definition (≥[ADDRESS_172353] or CCNA and requiring CDI treatment) any 
reported signs and symptoms (or preferably the associated diagnosis) should be reported as 
AEs/SAEs if prior to the Day [ADDRESS_172354] all symptoms (loose stools, abdominal cramps or pain, fever, visible blood or pus in stool, 
nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite or other) that apply to the patient at that evaluation on the CRF  
at the visits indicated.   
The Investigator will refer to the patient reported signs and symptoms when assessing cure and/or 
recurrence of CDI.  
8.1.3. Suspected Recurrence  
A recurrence of CDI is considered a disease related event (DRE) and not an adverse event (AE or SAE). See Section  8.3.7.  In the case of a suspected recurrence , a suspected recurrence of CDI CRF  
page should be completed-. Certain s pecified  - DRE complications of CDI should be reported as 
SAE s (refer to Section  8.3.7).  
Recurrence is defined as a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_76337] ( ≥3 UBMs in a 1- day period) with a positive 
C. difficile  free toxin test or CCNA that requires CDI treatment.

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  50 of 94 A UBM is defined as a Type 5, 6 or 7 bowel movement on the Bristol Stool Chart. 
Following cure of the  baseline CDI, if diarrhea returns (≥3 UBMs in a 1-day period) the 
Investigator will contact [CONTACT_149561]. 
It is required that every new epi[INVESTIGATOR_76337] (≥3 UBMs in a 1-day period) is investigated via 
a free toxin test unless the Investigator is highly confident that the diarrhea is due to a cause other 
than C. difficile.   
• If recurrence of CDI  is not suspected:  record the reason in the CRF  on the “ Suspected 
Recurrence of CDI” CRF page. 
• If recurrence is suspected:  
o Conduct a free toxin test as soon as possible and no later than [ADDRESS_172355] is negative it can be repeated once on the same sample or fresh sample.  
o Complete the “ Suspected Recurrence of CDI” CRF page 
o In all instances of suspected recurrence of CDI that are associated with a negative free toxin result obtained locally by [CONTACT_779], a stool sample should be collected and 
sent for testing by  [CONTACT_149562] (CCNA) at a central 
laboratory. This is a requirement irrespective of any locally c onducted CCNA.  
In addition, at the scheduled visits indicated in the SoA ( Section  1.3), the Investigator should also 
assess whether the patient has met the criteria for recurrence.  
Investigators are requested, subject to local treatment guidelines and Investigator judgement, to 
await the results of the free toxin test prior to initiating antimicrobial treatment for a suspected 
recurrence. The Investigator should discuss with the Medical Monitor if required.  
All the assessments as indicated in the SoA Recurrence Visit (Section  1.3) should be  carried out.  
Investigators are urged to follow the patient closely and directly assess and provide medical 
management of each suspected recurrence throughout the study. If a patient is assessed and/or treated by a non- study health care professional , the Investigator should obtain as much information 
as possible for CRF  entry.  
To ensure the data integrity of the primary and secondary endpoints , it is critical that the 
following requirements are met for all patients where possible:  
• A free toxin test is conducted as soon as possible following suspi[INVESTIGATOR_149515].  
• Any potentially confounding medications initiated must be recorded in the CRF  
• 
For all suspected recurrences associated with a negative free toxin test result 
obtained locally by [CONTACT_779], a stool sample should be collected for testing by [CONTACT_149534] a central laboratory.

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  51 of 94 8.1.4. Investigator Assessment s of Cure and Sustained Clinical Response 
Assessed  by [CONTACT_149563] (Section  1.3).  
Investigator assessment of cure:  
• At the D12/AOC visit the Inves tigator or medically qualified designee will determine if 
the patient is CURED or has FAILED to respond to study medication.  
• If the Investigator assesses a patient as FAILED at D12/AOC visit, the Investigator will 
continue to follow the patient and record an unscheduled visit as soon as the subject is 
assessed as cured into the CRF. The Investigator’s assessment is based on  the reduction of 
UBMs since baseline, clinical signs and symptoms and need for further treatment for CDI . 
A patient will be deemed cured once the Investigator ’s assessment is that  the baseline CDI 
has resolved such that no further non-study CDI treatment is ne eded. 
o At D40, D70 and D100 the Investigator or medically qualified designee will determine if the patient was CURED since the previous assessment  or continues to 
be FAILED . Once CURED has been recorded once (on D40 or D70), the 
subsequent assessments are n ot required (not applicable) . 
• Following cure of the baseline CDI (including patient that initially failed at D12/AOC and 
subsequently cured (meaning their baseline CDI resolved) , the Investigator will continue 
to follow-up on any subsequent suspected recurrences and record them in the CRF . 
Investigator assessment of sustained clinical response:  
• At D40, D70 and D100 the Investigator or medically qualified designee will determine if the patient has a sustained clinical response or experienced RECURRENCE since the previous assessment. When  recurrence has been recorded once, the subsequent assessment s 
are not required (not applicable) .  
• If the Investigator assesses a patient as FAILED for sustained clinical response,  then a 
future assessment of sustained clinical response, at subsequent time points, is no longer required.  
The Investigator will assess cure/failure and recurrence based on available information which includes, but is not limited to, improvement from baseline in the number of UBMs, signs & symptoms of CDI, and the requirement for CDI medication. The Investigator should assess cure/failure in a way that best reflects the Investigator’s standard clinical practice.  
NOTE: In line with treatment guidelines, laboratory and/or diagnostic testing for CDI should not be used to determine AOC [17, 31-33]. 
8.1.5. Stool (F ecal) Collection for Characterization  
Patients will be required to provide a stool sample at the time points specified in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). Patients will be provided with a home collection kit. If a sample is requested by [CONTACT_3786], the patient will provide the sample to the study site within [ADDRESS_172356], in  the event of a suspected 
recurrence. Aliquots of the sample will be prepared and immediately frozen and stored for shipment to the Central Laboratory. Guidance and instructions for Investigators will be available in the lab manual. 
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-[ADDRESS_172357] to the following analyses : 
• Free toxin test  for confirmation of eligibility and in the event of suspected recurrence. 
Sites may use an established local free toxin test if it is a suitable test,  and it is prospectively 
agreed with the Sponsor.  Suitab le tests will have appropriate regulatory approvals (FDA 
approval, EU CE Mark or equivalent). Free toxin tests will be provided for the site/site 
laboratory use if a suitable test is not available locally.  A negative free toxin test may only 
be repeated once on the same sample or a fresh sample.  
o Since C. difficile  free toxin EIA (enzyme immunoassay) kits can have sub -optimal 
sensitivity, a CCNA will be conducted via a central laboratory for those suspected 
recurrence events that had a negative free toxin te st result  obtained locally by [CONTACT_39722]. 
• Microbiology , microbiome , and bile acid analysis  at specialized centralized laboratories. 
The Investigator or designee will follow instructions in the lab manual and aliquot the samples as required.  
 
The samples from all patients will undergo the following assessments:  
• C. difficile  isolates recovered from samples (at baseline, end of treatment , and recurrence ) 
will undergo ribotypi[INVESTIGATOR_149516] a panel of antimicrobials that may 
include, but  is not be limited to, ridinilazole, fidaxomicin, vancomycin, metronidazole, 
rifaximin,  and tigecycline.  
• The presence or absence of vancomycin res istant Enterococci (VRE) may also be 
assessed.  
In addition, the relative impact of ridinilazole and vancomycin on the gut  microbiome and bile  
acid composition  will also be assessed.  Fecal  samples will be collected from all patients at the time  
points specified in the SoA ( Section  1.3). Selection of samples to be analysed will be based on pre -
specified criteria. Specific assessments may include:  
• Shotgun metagenomic sequencing will be used to investigate the gut  microbiome  
(microbiota and gene composition) beyond the cultivable species and thus determine 
deeper effects on the bowel microbiome  during therapy. • A free toxin test is conducted as soon as possible following  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_149515]. 
This is critical to meet the primary objective of the study.  
• Stool samples for free toxin testing should be as fresh as possible (preferably 
produced less than [ADDRESS_172358]).  
• Sites should request patients keep samples refrigerated from the point of production and sites should maintain refrigeration to the point of testing.  
• A stool sample produced by [CONTACT_149564] 
24 hours  for microbiology , microbiome , and bile acids. If the sample used for CDI 
testing was produced by [CONTACT_102] >[ADDRESS_172359] will be tested at a Central 
Laboratory via a CCNA. 
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  53 of 94 • Using Liquid Chromatography- mass spectro metry ( LC-MS/MS), fecal samples will be 
analyzed for bile acids.  
Stool samples will be stored for up to 5 years for potential future microbiology, microbiome and/or 
metabolome analysis.  
8.2. Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.2.1. Medical History (Including CDI History)  
The following will be recorded prior to randomization: 
• All relevant and significant medical history for 12 months prior to randomization  
• All medicat ions taken up to 4 weeks prior to randomization 
• All known CDIs along with the treatment administered  
• Use of any potential confounding medication up to 4 weeks prior to randomization  
• Information on the current/baseline CDI including confirmation of positive C. difficile  free 
toxin, the number of UBMs in the 24 hours prior to randomization and current signs and symptoms of CDI.   
Relevant medical history includes events that may contribute to the outcome of a treatment for CDI such as: major gastrointestinal surgery, nonsurgical gastrointestinal procedure s, significant 
infection s, conditions requiring immunosuppression, gastrointestinal disorders /diseases,  or cancer.  
Significant medical history includes pathology ( events , diseases, disorders,  or conditions)  that may 
be useful in assessing a safety event occurring during the study such as: major non- gastrointestinal 
surgery and major pathology of the cardiovascular , respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , endocrine, immunological 
(including HIV status) and neurological systems.   
8.2.2. Physical Examinations  
The ECG and physical exam may be conducted at the screening or baseline visit; if conducted at 
screening, the vital sign assessment will still need to be repeated at baseline.  
A physical examination will include, at a minimum, as sessm ents of the cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal and neurological systems. Height  (baseline only)  and weight  will also be measured 
and recorded. 
At the discretion of the Investigator, focused physical exam ination s may be completed on D ay 12, 
Day 40, and recurrence visits. The examination should include the measurement of vital sign s 
(temperature, blood pressure, pulse) and an abdominal examination.  Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.  
8.2.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supi[INVESTIGATOR_55848] 5 minutes’ rest and will include 
temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse.  
The same arm should be used to measure blood pressure throughout the study f or each patient.  
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  54 of 94 8.2.4. Electrocardiograms  
A single 12 -lead ECG will be obtained prior to randomization using an ECG machine that 
automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals. Manual 
measurements and calculations may be conducted in the absence of automated reporting of such intervals.  
The screening  ECG will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_29517] a medically qualified 
designee. Any abnormalities will be marked as clinically significant or not cl inically significant. 
Clinically significant abnormalities will be documented as current medical history and reported as an SAE if the definition of serious is met.  Importantly, an ECG does not need to be completed if 
patient’s most recent ECG was normal a nd was completed in the [ADDRESS_172360] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA (Section  1.3) 
for the timing and frequency.  
The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF .  
The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_85834]'s condition. 
All laboratory tests (with the exception of pregnancy tests) w ith values considered clinically 
significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_172361] dose of study 
treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_113543]. 
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period judged reasonable by [CONTACT_3786], the etiology should be identified, and the Sponsor notified. 
All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in  Section  10.[ADDRESS_172362] be conducted in 
accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA ( Section  1.3).   
If laboratory values from non- protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in patient management or are considered clinic ally 
significant by [CONTACT_737] (e.g., SAE or AE), then the results must be recorded in the CRF .  
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Refer to Section  10.3 for definitions and for details on how to assess, classify, and report 
AEs/SAEs . 
Adverse Events (AE s) will be reported by [CONTACT_102] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the patient's legally authorized representative/guardian).  The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or study procedures, or that caused the patient to discontinue the study treatment . (See  Section  7) 
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  55 of 94 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be collected from the signing of the informed consent 
form (ICF) until the D100 End of Study visit. 
All AEs will be collected from the time and date of first dose of study treatment until the D40 
follow  up visit. 
Changes in medical conditions that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History page of the CRF and not the AE CRF page. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee within 24 hours of awareness 
of the event, as indicated in Section  10.3.  The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to 
the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the study 
participation . However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a patient has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the study treatment or study participation, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section  10.3. 
8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open- ended and 
non-leading  verbal questioning of the patient should be used to inquire about AE occurrences.  
8.3.3. Follow- up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each patient at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is 
otherwise explained, or the patient is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). Further 
information on follow -up procedures is given in Section  10.3 . 
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs 
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_46352] a SAE is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of patients and the safety of a study treatment und er 
clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the 
regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and Investigators. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) per local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  56 of 94 An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety 
information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it along 
with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate per local requirements.  
8.3.5. Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in female patients and, female partners of male patients will be collected 
after the start of study treatment and until [ADDRESS_172363] dose.  
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours  of learning 
of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section  10.4. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, foetal  death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
8.3.6. Events NOT Meeting the AE/SAE Definition:  
• Disease Related Events (refer to Section  8.3.7) 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
8.3.7. Disease-Related Events Not Qualifying as AEs or SAEs: 
Disease- related events (DREs) are associated with the disease under study and will not be reported 
according to the standard process for reporting of SAEs even though the event may meet the definition of an SAE.  
The following DREs are common in patients wi th CDI:   
• CDI recurrence  
o CDI recurrences will be recorded for the patient on the “Suspected Recurrence of CDI” CRF page.  
Note: If on evaluation, no recurrence is deemed to have occurred, any symptoms (or 
preferably diagnosis) reported by [CONTACT_149565] b e reported as AEs (up to Day 40) 
and as SAEs (anytime during the study if the criteria for an SAE are met).  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments that are associated with CDI.  
• Treatment failure/lack of efficacy is not an adverse event but will be captured as an efficacy 
endpoint. 
• Signs or symptoms of CDI, including expected progression or worsening of CDI 
However, if any of the following complications related to CDI occurs, then the event must be recor ded and reported as such as an SAE (instead of a progression or worsening of CDI): 
o Toxic megacolon 
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  57 of 94 o Fulminant colitis  
o Colonic perforation  
A medical monitor will monitor suspected recurrence events on a regular basis.  
8.4. Treatment of Overdose  
The date and time of each dose will be recorded by [CONTACT_149566]. There is no specific 
treatment for overdos e; general medical support measures are to be in place, if required . Any SAE 
or SAE associated with excessive dosing  (overdose) must be followed as any other SAE or AE. 
Overdose is  only considered AEs or SAEs if there are associated clinical signs and symptoms (see 
Section  10.3) . 
8.5. Pharmacokinetics  
• PK samples will be collected on Day [ADDRESS_172364] 
received ridinilazole. It is understood that patients randomized to  the ridinilazole arm will 
receive active ridinilazole in Dose 1, placebo in Dose 2, active ridinilazole in Dose 3, 
placebo in Dose 4, etc. Therefore, to ensure that PK is taken following an active dose of ridinilazole, the blood draws for all patients wil l occur as follows:   
o Day 1 or 2 - at 2 and 4 hours (±30 minutes) post either Dose 1, 3, 5 or 7, and 
o EOT - at 2 and 4 hours (±30 minutes) post either Dose 33, 35, [ADDRESS_172365] be conducted following in- clinic administration of study medication. 
Accurate times of dosing and sampling should be recorded. 
• It is expected that some of the PK patients will meet the IDSA definition for severe disease 
(white blood cell count ≥15,000 cells/mm
3 or serum creatinine >1.5mg/dL). The PK 
samples will  be used to assess the impact of severe disease on the plasma exposure of 
ridinilazole.  
• The bioanalytical laboratory will be unblinded for these 100 PK patients and samples from 
ridinilazole assigned patients will be analyzed. Appropriate measures will be  taken to 
ensure that the laboratory does not disclose unblinded information to the study sites or Sponsor/CRO/Vendor. Sites will not receive any PK results until after database lock.  
• Residual plasma samples may be retained for up to 5 years from the end of the study for exploratory analysis of circulating metabolites  and/or assessing vancomycin 
concentrations. I f performed, this work will be reported separately.  
• Patients selected will be those who consent to take part from sites that are qualified to conduct the PK sampling.   
8.6. Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study.  
8.7. Genetics  
Genetics are not evaluated in this study.

Biomarkers are not evaluated in this study.  
8.9. Medical Resource Utilization and Quality of Life  
8.9.1. Medical Resource Utilization  
Medical resource utilization and health economics data, associated with medical encounters, will 
be collected in the CRF  by [CONTACT_96773]- site personnel for all patients throughout the 
study. Protocol -mandate d procedures, tests, and encounters are excluded. Data collected will 
include (but will not be limited to):  
• Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149517]  
• Patient location at admission and discharge location   
8.9.2. EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L [34] is a five -item questionnaire, which has been developed as a standardized 
measure of health status, which can provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and 
economic appraisal. It is cognitively undemanding, taking only a few minutes to complete. Patients will be asked to complete the EQ -5D- 5L at certain intervals throughout the study. Instructions to 
respondents are included in the questionnaire. The EQ -5D- 5L essentially consists of 2 page s – the 
EQ-5D descriptive system (page 2) and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) (page 3). The 
EQ-5D- 5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self- care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.  
If, at any v isit, the patient is unable to complete the EQ -5D- 5L independently then it should not be 
completed for that visit.  
Refer to Section  10.7. 
8.9.3. Cdiff32 Patie nt Reported Outcome  
The Cdiff32 [35] will be admini stered at US sites. It consists of 32 questions covering 3 major 
domains (physical, mental, and social) with 4 associated subdomains with each question scored on 
a five -point scale.  
If, at any visit, the patient is unable to complete the Cdiff32 independently then it should not be completed for that visit.   
Refer to Section  10.8.

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  59 of 94 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
The null (H 0) and alternative (H 1) hypotheses for the primary endpoint, SCR, can be expressed as:  
H0: µRID = µ VAN 
H1: µRID ≠ µVAN 
Where µ RID and µ VAN are the SCR rates for ridinilazole and vancomycin respectively.  
The null (H 0) and alternative (H 1) hypotheses for the secondary endpoint, Clinical Response , can 
be expressed as:  
H0: µRID - µ VAN ≤ -10% 
H1: µRID - µ VAN > - 10%  
where µ RID and µ VAN are the response  rates for ridinilazole and vancomycin respectively.   
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 680 patients (340 patients per treatment arm) will be randomly assigned to study 
treatment.  The Modified Intent- to-Treat ( mITT) population will be used for prima ry and secondary 
efficacy endpoints. 
For the primary endpoint of Sustained C linical Response, there is more than 95 % power  of 
concluding superiority of ridinilazole over vancomycin using a 2- sided test at the 5% significance 
level. This assumes a 1:1 rando mization of 680 patients (340 per group), an improvement of 15% 
with ridinilazole over vancomycin and a SCR rate of 57% with vancomycin  [36].  
For the secondary endpoint of C linical Response there is about 90% power of concluding non-
inferiority of ridinilazole compared to vancomycin, using a 1- sided test at the 2.5% significance 
level and a NI margin of 10%.  To preserve the Type 1 error a fixed sequence testing procedure will be adopted for the mITT 
popul ation . The order of testing for secondary endpoints will be  detailed in the statistical analysis 
plan. 
A blinded review of the efficacy endpoints will be conducted after approximately 70% of patients 
have completed their AOC assessment. The review will det ermine if increase sample size is needed 
to maintain adequate power for the primary endpoint . The maximum sample size increase will be 
25% of the initial sample size. Any increase above 25% of the initial sample size will require a 
protocol amendment. 
9.3. Populations for Analyses 
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: 
Population  Description  
Screened  All patients who sign the ICF  
Randomized  All patients randomly assigned to study treatment.  
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  60 of 94 Population  Description  
Modified ITT [mITT]  
(Efficacy)  All randomized  patients who take at least [ADDRESS_172366] ≥[ADDRESS_172367] one ridinilazole concentration 
(including below the lower limit of quantification).  
Safety  All patients randomly assigned to study treatment and who take at least [ADDRESS_172368] database lock will be described and justified in the 
final clinical study report.  
9.4.1 Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the combined database from the SMT19969/C004 and 
SMT19969/C005 studies for the mIT T population. 
Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  The primary analysis of SCR over [ADDRESS_172369] EOT will be analyzed using the 
Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test which will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<65 years 
of age and ≥65 years of age) , number of UBMs (<10 or ≥ 10) in the 24 hours 
prior to randomization, imm unocompromised (YES/NO),  and history of 
recurrent CDI (either none or [ADDRESS_172370] 12 months ). 
The treatment difference and 95% confidence interval, based  on the stratified 
Miettinen and Nurminen method, will also be presented.  
Secondary  The secondary endpoint s, Clinical Response  and Clinical Cure , will be analyzed. 
The difference between treatment proportions will be presented together with 
the 95% confidence interval, based on the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen 
method. Non- inferiority will be established if the lower limit of the 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval for the difference between treatment proportions 
(ridinilazole – vancomycin) is greater than -10%.  
The same methods of analysis as described for the primary endpoint will also be 
used to assess SCR over [ADDRESS_172371] EOT .  
Additional endpoints and corresponding analysis details will be described in

requirements of the individual registries.  
Summit will provide the Clinical Study Report to regulatory authorities as required. The 
Investigator will be provided with the full su mmary of the study results.  
10.1.6. Data Quality Assurance  
• All patient data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF  unless 
transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (e.g., laboratory data, eDiary data).  
• The Investigator is  responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
[CONTACT_1189] .  
• The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF .  
• Source data shoul d be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and 
complete. Changes to source data should be traceable, should not obscure the original 
entry, and should be explained if necessary (e.g., via an audit trail).  
• Although no changes will be permitted to patient reported data, the Investigator must review the e Diary data with patients to verify completeness, accuracy and 
contemporaneous data entry. Follow -up with patients is required if missing or inaccurate 
data is entered to ensure re- trainin g and prevent repeated non -compliance.  
• The Investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
• The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data  management of this study including 
quality checking of the data.  
• Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the CRF  by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from 
source docume nts; that the safety and rights of patients are being protected; and that the 
study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
• Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must 
be retained by [CONTACT_149571] 25 years after study completion unless

• Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the patient and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at th e Investigator’s site.  
• Data entered in the CRF  that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent 
with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The Investigator may 
need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available.  
• eDiary data , and/or patient contact [CONTACT_149572], are  
considered source data.  
• Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the Investigator Trial Site File . 
10.1.8. Study and Site Closure  
The Sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A s tudy site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have 
been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The Investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, and sufficient notice is given in 
advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_125491]:

10.3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient, temporally associated with the use of  study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study 
treatment.  
• 
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study treatment.  
Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).  
 
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
Results in death  
Is life- threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149518] (usually involving at least 
an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9235]/or treatment that would 
not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41365]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1085], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” 
occurred, or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149519] e treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
Study Number: SMT19969/C004  Compound No: SMT19969 Version 9.0; 09Aug2021  
CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  68 of 94 Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life  
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other situations:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important me dical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149520]. These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
 
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology or clinical chemistry) or other safety 
assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that 
worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the Investigator (i.e., not related to progression of underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing c ondition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a n overdose or suspected overdose of either 
study treatment or a concomitant medication.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" 
per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  69 of 94 Events NOT Meeting the AE /SAE Definition  
• Refer to Section  8.3.6 and  8.3.7 for events not meeting the AE/SAE definition.  
Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all  
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator will then  record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF . 
• It is not  acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_113502]’s medical records 
to the SAE coordinator in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF  page. 
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_149521]. In this case, all patient identifiers, except for the patient number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_149522]. 
• The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
 
 
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will assess intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign 
it to 1 of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_102], causing minimal discomfort,  and not 
interfering with ev eryday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is  a category utilized for rating the intensity of 
an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  70 of 94 Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment 
(ridinilazole/vancomycin) and each occurrence of each AE/SAE  as “related” or “not 
related ” by [CONTACT_77674]:  
‘‘Do  you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event  
has been caused by [CONTACT_104841]? ‘’  
The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitan t therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration 
will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator will consult both the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for ridinilazole and the 
Product Information  for vancomycin , in his/her assessment.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Pharmacovigilance ( the SAE coordinator ). 
However, it is very i mportant that the Investigator always assess causality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to  the SAE coordinator. If there 
are limited or insufficient information about the event to make an informed judgment, and in the absence of any indication or evidence to establish a causal relationship, a causality 
assessment of “no t related
” is to be considered. In such instances, the Investigator is 
expected to obtain additional information regarding the event as soon as possible and to  re-
evaluate the causality upon receipt of additional information.  
• The causality assessment is important to be provided because it is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory/authority reporting requirements  
• The investigator is requested to pro vide an explanation for the causality assessment for each 
SAE and must document this i n the medical notes, on the SAE form  and in the CRF . 
• Following a review of the relevant data, the causal relationship between the study 
treatment (vancomycin/ridinilazole ) and each (S)AE will be assessed by  
[CONTACT_49419] ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question:   
 
‘‘Do  you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event has been 
   caused by [CONTACT_104841]? ‘’  
• When making an assessment of causality, the follo wing factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there is evidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an (S)AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_104841] (rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out) or if there is e vidence to reasonably deny a causal relationship:  
• 
Plausible temporal relationship between exposure to the study treatment and 
(S)AE onset and/or resolution. Has the subject actually received the study 
treatment? Did the (S)AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the study treatment ? 
• Plausibility; i.e., could the event have been caused by [CONTACT_104841]? among 
others biologic and/or pharmacologic mechanism, half -life, and preclinical and

explained by [CONTACT_54648](s) or concomitant drugs ? 
• De-challenge/Dose reduction/Re- challenge:  
Did the (S)AE resolve or improve after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_149523]?  Also consider the impact of treatment for the event when evaluating 
a de-challenge experience.  
Did the (S)AE re -occur when the suspected study treatment was reintro duced 
after having been stopped?  
• Laboratory or other test results; a specific lab oratory  investigation supports the 
assessment of the relationship between the (S)AE and the study treatment (e.g., based on values pre - during and post -treatment).  
• Available alternative explanations independent of study treatment exposure (such as other concomitant drugs, past medical history, concurrent or underlying disease, risk factors including medical and family history, season, location, etc.) and strength of the alterna tive explanation.
 
• The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_114957] -up information 
and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_149574]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tes
ts or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a patient dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, 
the Investigator will provide the SAE coordinator with a copy of any post -mortem findings 
including histopathology. 
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF . 
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the SAE coordinator within 24 hours 
of receipt of the information .

Definitions:  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP 
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the patient’s medica l 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
Contracept ion Guidance : 
Male patients  
Male patients must use a barrier contraceptive method during sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing age or abstain from sexual intercourse during the study if it is their preferred and usual lifestyle.  
In addition, male patients must refrain from donating sperm for [ADDRESS_172379] dose of study treatment.  
Female patients  
Female patients of childbearing pote ntial are eligible to participate if they agree to use a highly

Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent a  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.   
 Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulationb  
• Oral  
• Intravaginal  
• Transdermal  
 Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Oral  
• Injectable  
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent a  
Implantable progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb 
• Intrauterine device (IUD) 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method if the partner is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.   
 Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the treatment period and continuing for 30 days after the end of study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.   
NOTES:  
a) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for patients participating in clinical studies.  
b) Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case, two highly effective methods of contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 
[ADDRESS_172380] dose of study treatment  
Pregnancy Testing:  
• WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highly sensitive urine or serum  pregnancy test (a urine test will be provided by [CONTACT_69741]).  
• Pregnancy testing will be performed at Day 12, Day [ADDRESS_172381] dose of study treatment.

CO-007-B-03  Ref: SOP -CO-007-03 CONFIDENTIAL   Page  75 of 94 Collection of Pregnancy Information: 
Male patients with partners who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male patient’s female 
partner who becomes pregnant while the male patient is in this study up to [ADDRESS_172382] dose of study treatment.  
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours  of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female 
partner will a lso be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the 
status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, the follow -up will 
be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the 
pregnancy will be reported regardless of foetal  status (presence or absence of anomalies) or 
indication for the procedure.  
Female Patients who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient who becomes 
pregnant up to [ADDRESS_172383] dose of study treatment. Information will be recorded on 
the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours  of learning of a patient's 
pregnancy. The patient will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow -up information on the patient and the neonate, and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow -up will not be required for 
longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of foetal  status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication 
for the procedure. 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post -study pregnancy 
relate d SAE considered reasonably related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_149576]  8.3.1. While the  Investigator is not obligated 
to actively seek this information in former study patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size:
The primary objective is to compare the change in hepatic fat fraction (%) from baseline to w eek [ADDRESS_169129]-baseline measurements, there will be 82% power to detect a difference of 5% in mean change from baseline at 
Week 16 in hepatic fat fraction (%) between each of 2 doses of BMS -986036 treatm ent groups (10 mgdaily and 20 
mg weekly) and placebo at a significance level of 0.05 (one-sided). These calculations are based on an assumption 
that the hepatic fat fraction (%) change from baseline is norm ally distributed with a standard deviation of no greater 
than 7%, as estimated from data ina similar population. No adjustment will be made for multiplicity. 
To allow  for dropouts, approximately 30 subjects per treatment group (total of 90 subjects) will need to be 
randomized, assuming up to 10% of the subjects do not complete post -baseline assessments.
Endpoints:
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing pre -dose measurement for all the endpoints.
Prim ary Endpoints : 
Change in hepatic fat fraction (%) from baseline to Week 16.
Safety endpoints include incidence of AEs, serious AEs, and events of special interest including injection 
site assessment, AEs leading to discontinuation, and death as well as marked abnormalities in clinical 
laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical examinations and bone mineral density (BMD) 
collected by [CONTACT_147615] .
Secondary Endpoin ts:
Pharm acokinetic endpoint : Assess the pharmacokinetic s of C-terminal and total BMS -986036 in NASH 
subjects to be assessed by [CONTACT_147616]: Ctrough
Immunogenici ty endpoints : anti-BMS -986036 antibodies and anti -FGF21 antibodies

Analyses:   
Prim ary Analysis:
To evaluate the effect of BMS -986036 on change in hepatic fat fraction (%) by [CONTACT_147617] 16 weeks of treatment, a longitudinal repeated measures analysis will be used to analyze the change in 
hepatic fat fraction (%) at Week [ADDRESS_169130]-baseline measurement. The model will include treatmen t group, week and treatment -by-week interactions as 
main effects and baseline hepatic fat fraction (%) and baseline diabetic status as covariates. An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be used to represent the correlation of the repeated measures within e ach subject.  The model 
will provide point estimates, standard errors and 2-sided 90% confidence intervals for mean change from baseline 
within and betw een treatments. P-values will be calculated to compare the treatment effect in each of two 
BMS -986036 (10 mg daily and 20 mg weekly) treatment groups to that in the placebo treatment group at Week 16. 
Each treatment group comparison will be performed at a one-sided 0.05 significance level. No adjustment will be 
made for multiplicity.
Summary statistics will be tabulated by [CONTACT_3148], study day for hepatic fat fraction (%) with corresponding change 
from baseline. Plot of mean profile over time will also be provided for hepatic fat fraction (%) by [CONTACT_3148] .
Safety Analysis:
All recorded adverse events will be listed and tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and treatment group. 
Vital signs and clinical laboratory test results will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. Any significant physical 
examination findings and clinical laboratory results will be listed. ECG readings will be evaluated by [CONTACT_147618], if present, will be listed.  BMD results will be tabulated.
Pharm acokinetic analyses:
Summary statistics will be tabulated for observed BMS -986036 ser um concentrations (Total and C -Term inal intact). 
Immunogenicity analyses:
Responses of anti-BMS -986036 antibodies and anti-FGF21 antibodies will be listed and tabulated by [CONTACT_147619]. The relationship betw een immunogenicity and PK and/or PD may be explored.
 
 
 
 
Interim Analyses:
Because data emerging from this study may be needed for timely decision about adjustment to the development of 
the program, an interim analysis will be conducted after approximately [ADDRESS_169131] of summaries of the available data without revealing individual subjects' treatment 
assignments. The results of the interim analysis will be review ed by  a pre -specified panel of personnel.

1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit A ssessment
This is the first study  in which BMS -986036 will be administered to patients with NASH ;two 
previous studies have been conducte dor are ongoing including the completed first-in-human 
study  in obese ,but otherwise healthy  volunteers and a n ongoing study  in obese diabetic subjects.
The preclinical data in diabetic NASH animal models, and clinical data in non-diabetic and 
diabetic subjects, demonstrate beneficial metabolic effects with short term administration of 
BMS -986036 (up to 12 weeks) . Thes e benefits included weight loss , reduction of hepatic fatand 
improved insulin sensitivity ;however, it is not known whether study subjec ts with obesity  and 
NASH in this proof of concept study  will benefit in these or other ways from BMS -986036.  In 
additi on, immunogenicity, bone effects andinjection site reactions will be explored as potential 
risks of BMS -986036. Data from this phase 2astudy  will be used to guide future clinical 
development of BMS -986036.
1.5.[ADDRESS_169139] 
immunogenicit y in humans.34  Following daily  dosing, BMS -986036 ADA were detected in rats 
and monkey s in 1-month (up to 59% and 20%, respectively ) and 4-month (up to 87% and 30%, 
respectivel y) toxicology studies at all doses tested. However, the presence of ADAs in these 
species had no substantial or meaningful impact on the overall toxicokinetic results of total and 
C-terminal intact BMS -986036, pharmacod ynamic, toxicology , clinical pathology  or 
histopathology  endpoints on these studies. 
In the first in human study , three of 72 subjects (4%) dosed with BMS -

decreasing assay  titers at subsequent visits over a six month time period.  One of these three 
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 03-Jun-[ADDRESS_169141] a generall y normal phenoty pe.35  The clinical consequences of a neutralizing 
anti-drug antibody  (ADA) response to endogenous FGF21 are unknown, as FGF21 deficiency  
has not been reported in humans. Subject safet y will be closely  guarded in early clinical studies. 
All subjects administered BMS -986036 will be closely  monitored for possible immunogenicit y 
related adverse events (AEs), such as rash, fever and severe injection site reactions. Clinically 
relevant immune reactions (e.g. hypersensitivity  reactions) considered related to BMS -[ADDRESS_169142] dose (D142 follow -up visit), and at approximately  [ADDRESS_169143] dose (D292 follow -up visit). If present, antibodies will be assessed for 
neutralizing activity . Subjects with a positive result in the ADA and/or anti-FGF21 antibody
assay sat the Day 142or Day 292follow -up visits, without evidence of decreasing or stable 
antibodies, will be followed afterwards with immunogenicit y assessments for up to 12months
after the D142 visit until antibody  levels resolve or demonstrate a consistent decreasing trend . 
These immunogenicity  follow -up visits will be conducted approximately  every  6-8 weeks.
In addition, endogenous FGF21 will be measured at all follow up visits, including the D142 and 
D292 follow up visits and the immunogenicity  follow up visits (for subjects with positive ADA
and/or anti-FGF21 antibodies at D142 and/or D292 , without evidence of decreasing or stable 
antibodies).
Bone effects
No bone resorption marker change has been observed in subjects in the first in human study 
(MB130001). Bone formation markers were slightly  reduced in all subjects in the MAD, 
including those treated with placebo, and only in subjects treated with the highest daily dose 
(30mg daily ) were bone markers reduced to an extent greater than placebo.  A 
BMS -986036-related bone risk to adult humans isconsidered low; unlike thiazolidinediones
(TZDs ), bone resorption markers were not increased. To minimize the potential risk to subjects 
in whom a reduction of bone formation markers could impact skeletal healing, those with recent 
fracture or orthopedic surgery  will be excluded.
To asses s whether chronic dosing of BMS -986036 has the potential to modulate bone turnover 
and vitamin D and mineral metabolism, bone turnover markers (BSAP, P1NP and CTX -1), PTH 
and 1,25 dihy droxy vitamin D along with calcium, magnesium, phosphorus are being assessed in 
the ongoing MB130002 study  in T2DM subjects. .

(as per country  guidelines) are clearl y and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and 
other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed 
consent form(s) which will include all elements required by  [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory  
requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
Provide a copy of the consent form (s)and written information about the study  in the 
language in which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study  participation. The 
language must be non -technical and easily  understood. 
Allow time necessary  for subject or subject's legally  acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details of the study .
Obtain an informed consent signed and personally  dated by [CONTACT_29159]'s 
legally  acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_52223]. 
Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_109372] (s)and any  other information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of the 
study, and after any  revisions are completed for new information.
If informed consent is initially  given by a subject’s legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently  becomes capable of making and communicating his 
or herinformed consent during the study , consent must additionally  be obtained from the 
subject.
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study  and of any new information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study . This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality  of records that could identify  subjects must be protected, respect ing the 
privacy  and confidentiality  rules applicable to regulatory  requirements, the subjects' signed ICF 
and, in the US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form (s)must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory  authorities have 
direct access to subject records.
The rights, safet y, and well -being of the study  subjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.

3.1 Study Design and Duration
Study  MB130045 is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, paralle l-group, multiple 
dose design. Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility  within 42days 
prior to randomization.  There will be a 7-day study skills training (Lead -In) period prior to 
randomization on Day 1. Eligible subjects will be randomized via IVRS on Day 1  to 1 of 3
parallel treatment groups. In total, approximately 90 randomized subjects (30per group; ratio 
1:1:1) will self-administer double -blind treatment, once daily for 16weeks, in an outpatient 
setting. Subjects will be stratified using a diagnosis of Ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus (y es vs no ) based 
on current American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria .Clinic visits are scheduled 
approximately  every [ADDRESS_169147] safet y, PK and PD measures.

3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy  or bilateral 
oophorectom y) andis not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as [ADDRESS_169160] a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone, 
(FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause .
Females treated with hormone replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely  to have artificiall y 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH levelis >40 mlU/ml at any time 
during the washout period, the woman can considered postmenopausal.
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products, (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal pr oducts
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may  require washout periods as long as 6 months.

Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 03-Jun-[ADDRESS_169173] in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study , including products alread y with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently  than the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
[CONTACT_20443].
In this protocol, investigational product(s) are:
Placebo solution for subcutaneous injection
BMS -986036- 01 Injection, 10mg/ml (10mg/vial)
4.[ADDRESS_169174] storage manager should ensure that the study  drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidi ty) as determined by [CONTACT_20444]. If concerns 
regarding the qualit y or appearance of the study  drug arise, the study drug should not be 
dispensed and contact [CONTACT_20445] .
Study  drug not supplied by  [CONTACT_53972].
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by [CONTACT_20447]) must be maintained 
that includes all processes required to ensure drug is accuratel y administered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes ( e.g., required diluents, administration sets).
4.[ADDRESS_169175] Identification
During the Screening visit, the investigative site will call into the enrollment option of the 
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) designated by [CONTACT_109417] a 5-digit 
subject number that will be unique across all sites. Enrolled subjects, including those not dosed, 
will be assigned sequential subject numbers starting with [ZIP_CODE], eg, [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE].... 
[ZIP_CODE]. The patient identification number (PID) will ultimately  be comprised of the site number 
and subject number. For example, the first subject screened (ie, enrolled) a t site number 1, will 
have a PID of [ADDRESS_169176] meets the eligibility  criteria 
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 03-Jun-[ADDRESS_169177]
At the time of entry  into the lead-in period (Day  -7 visit), the site will call IVRS in order for the 
lead-in medication to be assigned and dispensed. Subjects who successfully complete the lead-in 
period and meet the criter ia for entry  into the treatment period (see Section 3.3), will be 
randomly  assigned by [CONTACT_147632] 3 double -blind treatment groups in a 
1:1:1 ratio:
BMS -986036 10 mg once daily  (QD)
BMS -986036 20 mg once weekl y (QW)
Placebo ( QD)
Random ization will be stratified based upon diagnosis of Ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus (y es vs . no).
The two strata for randomization are defined as follows:
Strata 1: Diabetes Mellitus -Yes
Strata 2: Diabetes Mellitus -No
Randomized subjects who discontinue will not be replaced.
Randomization schedules for both subject treatment and containers will be generated and kept by 
[CONTACT_414] -Myers Squibb and stored in a secure location with restricted access.
At all study  visits when study  medication is dispensed, each subject will be assigned a kit 
number b y the IVRS. Kit numbers will be assigned randoml y and will correspond to the numbers 
printed on the packages and kits containing study  drug. Kit numbers will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRFs. The IVRS will be availabl e 24 hours per day , 7 day s per week.
4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity  of this clinical study . However, in the 
event of a medical emergency  or pregnancy  in an individual subject in which knowledge of the 
investigational product is critical to the subject’s management, the blind for that subject may be 
broken by [CONTACT_093]. The subject’s safety  takes priority  over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Befor e breaking the blind of an individual subject’s treatment, the investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary , i.e., that it will alter the subject’s immediate 
management. In many cases, particularl y when the emergency  is clearly not related to the 
investigational product, the problem may be properly  managed by [CONTACT_82745]. It is highly  desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed with the Medical M onitor, but the investigator alway s has ultimate authority  for the 
decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_109377].
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_941] M edical Monitor and ensure every  attempt is made 
to preserve the blind.
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 03-Jun-[ADDRESS_169178] for non-emergency  purposes should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.
In case of an emergency , the I nvestigator(s) has unrestricted access to randomi zation information 
via the IVRS and is capable of breaking the blind through the IVRS system without prior 
approval from sponsor. Following the unblinding the Investigator shall notify  the Medical 
Monitor /Study  Director .
Also, designated staff of BMS Research and Development can be unblinded at any time. The 
Bioanal ytical Sciences section or its designate will be unblinded to the randomized treatment 
assignments in order to minimize unnecessary  analysis of samples from control group subjects. 
A single pharmacokineticist or designate in Clinical Pharmacology Pharmacometrics and a 
Biomarker scientist may be unblinded in order to prepare preliminary  summaries of 
pharmacokinetic, pharmacody namic, and safet y data, as needed before data aremore generally  
unblinded. These summaries will not reveal individual subjects’ treatment assignments. Except 
as noted above, other members of BMS Research and Development will remain blinded.
4.6.1 Interim Analysis Unblinding 
In the event of an Interim Analy sis, the interim analy ses will be performed by [CONTACT_147633]. The access to unblinded interim individual data will be limited to pre-specified 
personnel (e.g. statistician, programmer, PK scientist, pharmacometrician and data integration 
programmer from Clinical Pharmacology  and Pharmacometrics) as necessary  to perform the 
interim analy sesand data summaries . Except as noted above, other members of BMS Research 
and Development will remain blinded to individual subjects’ data .
Data summari es will not reveal individual subjects’ treatment assignments and will be presented 
using masked treatment codes .  D atasummaries will be provided to the following BMS 
personnel: Early  Development Team Lead , Exploratory  Clinical and Translational Research
Therapeutic Area (TA) Head ,PK TA Head, Statistical TAHead and Biomarker TAHead. The 
study  team other than the aforementioned personnel will be blinded to data summaries.
4.[ADDRESS_169179] and a count of the vials. The Investigator (or designee) 
will record the amount of study  drug dispensed and returned at each visit and the dates of any 
study  drug interruption. During the double -blind treatment period, if the subject is ≤ 80%
compliant with study  drug (BMS -986036/matching placebo )the period of noncompliance should 
be noted as a protocol deviation and the sponsor should be notified. The subject should be 
educated /properl yinstructed by [CONTACT_147634].

Bone imaging (hip and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at all imaging facilities and body  
composition (whole body ), an exploratory  measure, will be additionally  carried out at imaging 
facilities with the ap propriate hardware/software.
DXA will be conducted at baseline, end of treatment (Day 112, ( +/- 1 week) and approximately  6 
months after the end of the treatment (Day 292, +/ -2 weeks ).   
Screening DXA should be performed approximately  21 days prior to the Day 1 dose.  Eligibility 
should be conf irmed b y central imaging lab prior to entry  into the lead -in period ( Day -7).   
A repeat DXA may  be performed if clinically  indicated.

positive ADA responses will be confirmed for specificity  using an immunodepletion format with 
drug BMS -986036 and un-PEGy lated drug. The reactivity  of confirmed positive responses will
be characterized as “BMS -986036” (specific to the FGF21 region) or “PEG” (specific to the 
PEGy lated region) based on the immunodepletion specificity . Additionally , samples with 
confirmed positive responses will be tittered to determine the relative positi ve response.  The 
sensitivity  was determined to be 20 ng/mL and the drug tolerance at antibody  concentrations of 
50, 100, 500, and 10,000 ng/mL  was determined to be 1, 4, 16, and 48µg/mL of BMS -986036

Subjects will also be monitored for antibodies to FGF21 using a validated homogenous bridge 
assay  with Met-FGF21 (recombinant produced) and electrochemical luminescence detection.  
Samples will first be screened for potential positive anti-FGF21 responses. Then the samples 
with positive anti-FGF2 1 responses will be confirmed for specificit y using an immunodepletion 
format with wild type sequence FGF21 (WSFGF -21).  Samples with confirmed positive 
anti-FGF21 responses will be ti trated to determine the relative positive response.  The sensitivity  
was determined to be ≤ 5 ng/mL and the drug tolerance at antibody  concentrations of 50, 100, 
500, and 10,000 ng/mL was determined to be > 48 µg/mL of BMS -986036.

5.8 Outcomes Research A ssessments
Not applicable.
5.9 Other A ssessments 
5.9.1 Height and Body Mass Index (BMI)
Measurement of height should be performed with the subject’s shoes removed. The subject’s 
knees should be straightened, head held erect and ey es forward
Weight must be recorded using a calibrated scale, preferably  the same scale at each clinic 
visit.  Subject should remove shoes and heav y clothing before standing on scale.
BMI is used as an index of obesity  and is a method of defining normal body  weight and 
excess body  fat. It correlates in a population with percent body  fat. BMI is determined by 
[CONTACT_8497], (kg) divided b y height (m) squared
Method of BMI Calculation:
Use actual height and weigh t
To calculate BMI:
Convert pounds (lbs) to kilograms (kg = lb / 2.2)
Convert inches (in) to centimeters (cm = in X 2.54)
BMI = (weight in kg) / (height in cm/100)2
Round to one decimal place (if 0.05 or greater, round up)
The BMI calculation is used for assessment for inclusion. All analy sis calculations for BMI 
will be derived internall y by [CONTACT_147653] (if not applicable).

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in aclinical investigation subject administered study  drugand that 
does notnecessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unint ended sign (such asan abnormal laboratory  finding ), symptom, or disease 
tempora lly associated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The ca usal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonab le causal relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.

Clinical Protocol MB130045
BMS -986036 peg-fgf21
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
results in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event inwhich the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have caused 
death if it were more severe)
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see 
NOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth def ect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [e.g., 
medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also 
considered an important medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential 
DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study 
drug is an SAE.
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by [CONTACT_52252], these events must be handled asSAEs. (See 
Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52205]: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery , planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscop y)
medical/surgical admission other than to remedy  ill health and planned prior to entry  into 
the study . Appropriate documentation is required in these cases

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB)7represent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting.
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures . All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within [ADDRESS_169202] be collected that relate 
to any  later protocol -specified procedure ( e.g., a follow -up skin biopsy ). 
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed 
to be related to stud y drug or protocol- specified procedure.
An SAE report should be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not relate d to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of thestudy (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be report ed to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_169203] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy  Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred method for SAE data 
reporting collection is through the eCRF.  The paper SAE/preg nancy  surveillance forms are only  
intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.  In this case, the paper 
forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_147656].
SAE Facsimile Number :Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used and submitted immediately , only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required forSAE and pregnancy  reporting) :Refer toContact 
[CONTACT_20491].
If only limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -
up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drugor if new inform ation 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using th e same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.

All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of non serious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Non serious 
AEinformation should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug andfor those present at the end of study  treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study .
6.[ADDRESS_169204] result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clini cally  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any laboratory test result abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory test result abnormality  that required the subject to receive specific 
correc tive therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by 
[CONTACT_9673] ( e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.[ADDRESS_169205] immediately  notify  the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form to BMS Designee within [ADDRESS_169206] cases, the study  drug will be permanently  discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., 
dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study  drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study  drug after a thorough 
discussion of benefits and risk with the subject.

and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within [ADDRESS_169208] be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details ).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely  confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting de tails).
Potential drug induced liver injury  is defined as:
1. ALT ≥ 5 times baseline or nadir value, whichever is lower, AND ≥ [ADDRESS_169209] (upper limit of 
normal),
AND
2. Total bilirubin ≥[ADDRESS_169210], 
AND
3. No other immediately  apparent possible causes of ALT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram, x-ray filming, any other potential safet y assessment required or not required

8 STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The primary  objective is to compare the change in hepatic fat fraction (%) from baseline to week 
[ADDRESS_169212]-baseline measurements, there will be 82% power to 
detect a difference of 5% in mean change from baseline at Week 16 in hepatic fat fraction (%)
between each of 2 doses of BMS -986036 treatment groups (10 mg daily and 20 mg weekl y) and 
placebo at a significance level of 0.05 (one-sided). These calculations are based on an 
assumption that the hepatic fat fraction (%) change from baseline is normally distributed with a 
standard deviation of no greater than 7%, as estimated from data reported in a similar

Involvement in trial design
Subject recruitment ( e.g., among the top quartile of enrollers)
The data collected during this study  are confidential and proprietary  to BMS . Any publications 
or abstracts arising from this study  require approval by [CONTACT_109434]’s publication requirements as set forth in the approved clinical trial 
agreement (CTA). All draft publications, including abstracts or detailed summaries of any 
proposed presentations, must be submitted to BMS at the earliest practicable time for review, bu t

Expanded definition Complete abstinence as defined as 
complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse is an 
acceptable form of contraception for all study  drugs. This 
also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifesty le 
of the patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, profession of abstinence 
for entry  into a clinical trial, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Subjects who choose complete a bstinence are 
not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy  tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highl y effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abstinence.
Medical Research Those scientific activities which cannot be reasonabl y 
anticipated at the time of trial design, for which we would 
like to collect and/or retain samples from study  participants.  
Examples of additional research include, but are not limited 
to, new assay  development and validation, companion 
diagnostic development, new hypotheses in the interaction of 
drug and the human body , and exploration of emerging 
science in the understanding of disease.

APPENDIX 1 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA  FOR DRUG A NDALCOHOL A BUSE
The following is taken from DSM- IV:
Diagnostic Criteria for Psy choactive Substance Dependence
A maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically  significant impairment or distress as 
manifested by [CONTACT_14774] (or more) of the following, occurring at any time in the same 12-month 
period:
1.Tolerance, as defined b y either of the following:
a)A need for markedl y increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or 
desired effect,
b)Markedl y diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance.
2.Withdrawal, as manifested by  [CONTACT_147664]:
a)The characteristic withdrawal s yndrome for the substance,
b)The same (or close ly related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal 
symptoms.
3. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.
4. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use.
5.A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary  to obtain the substance (e.g., visiting 
multiple doctors or driving long distances), use the substance (e.g., chain -smoking) or 
recover from its effects.
6.Important social, occupational or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of 
substance use.
7.The substance use is continued despi[INVESTIGATOR_147607] a persistent or recurring 
physical or psychological problem that is likely  to have been caused or exacerbated by [CONTACT_147665] (e.g., current cocaine use despi[INVESTIGATOR_147608] -induce depression, or 
continued drinking despi[INVESTIGATOR_147609].)
Criteria for Severity  of Psy choactive Substance Dependence:
Mild:  Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, and the 
symptoms result in no more than mild impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social 
activities or relationships with others.
Moderate:  S ymptoms or functional impairment between “mild” and “se vere”.
Severe:  Many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, and the symptoms 
markedl y interfere with occupational functioning or with usual social activities or relationships 
with others.
In Partial Remission:  During the past six mont hs, some use of the substance and some 
symptoms of dependence.

Clinical Protocol MB130045
BMS -986036 peg-fgf21
In Full Remission:  During the past six months, either no use of the substance, or use of the 
substance and no s ymptoms of dependence.
Diagnostic Criteria for Psy choactive Substance Abuse
A. A maladaptive pattern of psychoactive substance use, leading to clinically  significant 
impairment or distress as manifested by  [CONTACT_31806] (or more) of the following, occurring at any time 
in the same 12- month period:
1.Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, 
school, or home (e.g., repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance 
use; substance -related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school, neglect of 
children or household).
2.Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physicall y hazardous (e.g., driving an 
automobile or operating a machine when impaired by  [CONTACT_137214]).
3.Recurrent substance -related legal problems (e.g., arrests for substance -related disorderl y 
conduct).
4.Continued subst ance use despi[INVESTIGATOR_147610] (e.g., arguments with 
spouse about consequences of intoxication, phy sical fights).
B.The symptoms have never met the criteria for substance dependence for this class of 
substance.

partial  clinical hold subjects 
remained off treatment for a 
prolonged period of time.  As such 
a significant gap in dosing occurred 
which would render any further 
data to inform additional

Title MOVE Trial: A Phase 3, Eff icacy and Safety Study of Oral Palovarotene for the 
Treatment of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP)  
Sponsor  Clementia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Objectives  Primary Objectives   
• To evaluate the efficacy of palovarotene in decreasing heterotopic 
ossification (HO) in adult and pediatric subjects with FOP as assessed by 
[CONTACT_6398]-dose, whole body computed tomography (WBCT), excluding head, as 
compared to untreated subjects from Clementia’s FOP natural history study  
over 24 months . 
• To evaluate the safety of palovarotene in adult and pediatric subjects with 
FOP. 
Secondary Objectives   
• To evaluate the effect of palovarotene on flare -up rate and proportion of 
subjects reporting at least one flare -up. 
• To evaluate the effect of palovarotene on range of motion (ROM) as 
assessed by [CONTACT_566878] 
(CAJIS).  
• To evaluate the effect of palovarotene on physical function using 
age-appropriate forms of the FOP -Physical Function Questionnaire 
(FOP -PFQ).  
• To evaluate the effect of palovarotene on physical and mental health using 
age-appropriate forms of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Scale.  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of palovarotene.  
Secondary Objective (Part B)  
• To continue to provide palovarotene to adult and pediatric subjec ts with 
FOP and to monitor  longer -term safety.  
Secondary Objective (Part C) 
• To implement safety measures based on DMC recommendations  in order 
to ensure that assessments of safety continue for up to [ADDRESS_744474] 
dose of study  treatment for skeletally immature subjects.    
 
Study  Design  A Phase 3, multicenter, open -label study in adult and pediatric subjects with FOP  
will be conducted in three  parts : Part A , the main part of the study ; Part B , the 24- 
month extension ; and Part C, the up-to-2-year post  last dose  of study treatment 
follow -up for skeletally immature subjects .  Sources of subjects eligible for 
enrollment in  Part A of  the MOVE Trial will include: (1)  subjects from Study 
PVO -1A-001 (the natural history stud y [NHS]);  (2)  additional subjects clinically 
diagnosed with FOP with the R206H ACVR1 mutation or other FOP variants 
reported to be associated with progressive HO (who have not previously 
participated in any Clementia -sponsored study) ; and (3)  Phase 2 Study PVO -1A-
202 or Study  PVO -1A-204 subjects who cannot receive the chronic/flare -up 
regimen due to country of residence or those traveling long distances to participate 
in the Phase  2 trial.  Up to a maximum of 110  subjects will be enrolled into the 
MOVE Tri al (up to 99 with the R206H mutation and no previous exposure to 
palovarotene, and  up to  11 with other mutations or previous participation in the 
Phase 2 trials), and receive chronic dosing for up to 24 months and undergo flare-
up-based  treatment should they experience an eligible flare -up or traumatic event 
as confirmed by [CONTACT_737].

CLEMENTIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC. 30 OCTOBER  2020  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol Synopsis  
As of 04Dec2019 all subjects < 14 years of age were required to interrupt study 
drug due to a partial clinical hold placed on the palovarotene cli nical development 
program by [CONTACT_55257]. Treatment will subsequently not be restarted in children 
<14 years of age.  
The efficacy of palovarotene treatment in the MOVE Trial  Part A , as measured by 
[CONTACT_566879], will be compared to that obser ved in untreated 
subjects who participated in the NHS.  
Study  Design (cont.)  
 In Part B, the study will be extended for an additional 24 months in order to 
provide the chronic/flare -up palovarotene dosing regimen to all subjects until 
commercial availabili ty and to obtain longer -term safety data .  No new subjects 
will be enrolled into Part B .  
Chronic Treatment : Part A  
Subjects will receive orally administered 5 mg palovarotene once daily 
(weight -adjusted for skeletally immature subjects [ie, subjects under the age of 
18 years with less than 90% skeletal maturity on hand -wrist  radiography at 
Screening]) as chronic dosing for  up to  48 months.  Note: all weight -based dosing,  
both chronic and flare -up, will cease when subjects achieve ≥90%  skeletal 
maturity based on hand -wrist  radiography, but radiographic assessment of the 
growth plate (performed at Study Months 6, 12, 18, and 24 ) will continue until 
these subjects achieve 100% closure of the growth plate at both locations.   
Additional radi ographic assessments will be performed at Study Months 3, 9, 15, 
or 21 in those subjects who (1)  received the flare -up dosing regimen in the period 
of time since their last radiographic assessment; and (2) had not achieved 100% 
skeletally maturity on their  last radiographic assessment.   All subjects will 
undergo the procedures and assessments specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
in Table 1, including low -dose, WBCT (excluding head) at Screening and at site 
visits at Months 6, 12, 18, and 24.    
 In order to ensure consistent interpretation of the acquired images, a central 
imaging laboratory will perform blinded reads of all images  obtained i n this study  
as well as those obtained from the natural history study (control group)  using 
standardized procedures  as documented  in the Image Acquisition Guidelines and 
Independent Review Charter .  Remote visits (eg, at home, at a local medical 
facility, or via video -conference or telephone contact [CONTACT_566880]) 
will occur at Week 6 and at Study Months 3, 9, 15, and 21 unless the Investigator 
deems that a site visit is necessary; urine pregnancy tests will be performed each 
month for female s of childbearing potential (FOCBP).   
Chronic Treatment: Part B  
The assessments conducted in Part A will continue into Part B except that WBCT 
imaging will be performed annuall y thereafter  at Months 36 and 48.  
Flare -up-Based Treatment : Parts A and B  
Subjec ts will report potential flare -up symptoms to site personnel; such symptoms 
include, but are not limited to pain, swelling, redness, decreased range of motion, 
stiffness, and warmth.  Only one symptom is required to define a flare -up.  If these 
symptoms are consistent with previous flare -ups, include a subject -reported onset 
date, and are confirmed by [CONTACT_566881] a flare -up, subjects 
will immediately begin flare-up-based  treatment.   Flare -up-based  dosing should  
also be ini tiated if the Investigator confirms the presence of a substantial high -risk 
traumatic event likely to lead to a flare -up.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol Synopsis  
 • Palovarotene 20 mg for 4 weeks (28 days) once daily.  The first dose will be 
taken upon flare -up or traumatic event confirmation by [CONTACT_737] 
(Flare -up Day 1).   
To be followed by:  
• Palovarotene 10 mg for 8 weeks (56 days) once daily.  For a total fl are-up 
treatment duration of 12 weeks (84 days).  
Study  Design (cont.)  If the Investigator deems it necessary, the subject can be evaluated at the clinical 
site to confirm the presence of a flare -up.  Based on clinical signs and symptoms 
as determined by [CONTACT_737], treatment may be extended in 4 -week intervals 
while on -treatment with 10 mg palovarotene, and continue until the flare -up 
resolves and the 4 -week extension treatment has been completed.  
Subjects will be provided with the app ropriate dose of study drug to be used to 
initiate treatment with palovarotene when a flare -up or traumatic event is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_737].  
 Flare -up dosing will be weight -adjusted in subjects under the age of 18 years with 
less than 90% skeletal maturity on hand -wrist  radiography at Screening.  
Should a subject experience an intercurrent flare -up (defined as a new flare -up 
location or marked worsening of original flare -up), or substantial traumatic event 
likely to lead to a flare -up, at any time du ring flare-up-based  treatment, the 
12-week dosing regimen will restart upon new intercurrent flare -up or traumatic 
event confirmation by [CONTACT_737] (ie, 4 weeks of 20 mg palovarotene 
followed by 8  weeks of 10  mg palovarotene [or weight -based equivale nts]).  A 
Flare -up Cycle will include the first flare -up or traumatic event and any 
subsequent intercurrent flare -ups or traumatic events during the same dosing 
period.  Flare -Up Cycle Safety Day [ADDRESS_744475] flare -up or traumatic event in the cycle 
is completed.  If an y flare -up in a cycle has not resolved after 12  weeks, treatment 
and safety assessments will be extended, and 10  mg palovarotene (or the 
weight -based equivalent) will be administered in [ADDRESS_744476] resolved and flare -up-based tre atment has been 
completed, subjects will resume chronic treatment with 5  mg palovarotene once 
daily (weight -adjusted doses for skeletally immature subjects).  
Subjects currently receiving flare-up-based  treatment in Study PVO -1A-[ADDRESS_744477] flare -up 
symptom.  
Off-treatment  Part C:  No study drug will be administered in Part C.  For 
skeletally immature subjects  in Part C , added  Year 1 (Y1) and Year 2 (Y2) post  
last dose of study  treatment assessments that include linear height, knee height, 
weight, physical exam, vital signs, radiographic assessments of the knee and hand -
wrist , low -dose WBCT imaging, adverse events,  and concomit ant medications. 
Once subjects reach skeletal maturity their participation in Part C will end.  The

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol Synopsis  
Comparator  In this single -arm treatment study, the control reference group will be the 
untreated subjects who participated in the NHS.  
Assessments of Efficacy  Primary Endpoint:  
The annualized change in new HO volume as assessed by [CONTACT_6398] -dose, WBCT 
(excluding head) compared to untreated subjects from the NHS  over 24 months.  
Secondary Endpoints  assessed in Parts A and B : 
1. The proportion of subjects (key secondary endpoint) with any new HO.  
2. The change from baseline in the number of body regions with new HO.  
3. The proportion of subjects reporting flare -ups. 
4. The flare -up rate per subject -month exposure.  
Assessments of Efficacy 
(cont.)  Exploratory Endpoints  assessed in Parts A and B : 
1. Change from baseline in ROM assessed by [CONTACT_566882].  
2. Change from baseline in physical function using age appropriate forms of 
the FOP -PFQ.  
3. Change from baseline in physical and mental function for subjects 
≥15 years old and mental function for subjects <15 years old using age 
appropriate forms of the PROMIS Global Health Scale.  
Assessments of Safety  Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) and serious AE (SAE) 
reporting, electrocardiogram s, vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood 
pressure, and heart rate), physical examination, body weight and height, laboratory 
parameters (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), urine pregnancy tests for 
FOCBP, and concomitant medication repo rting.  Concomitant medications will 
include treatment per standard of care, which may or may not include 
corticosteroids (eg, prednisone at 2  mg/kg PO to a maximum dose of 100 mg 
daily) for 4 days.  
 Evaluation of subjects under the age of 18 enrolled with open epi[INVESTIGATOR_566848] (anterior/posterior [AP] view) and hand -wrist  radiographs 
(posterior/anterior [PA] view) for assessment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_566849];  tibial and femoral long bone lengths;  and standardiz ed stadiometry 
and knee height for assessments of linear growth (in triplicate).  If there is 
evidence of partial or complete premature growth plate closure (with or without 
growth deceleration) study drug may be continued, interrupted, de -escalated, or 
discontinued.  Dose modification decisions will be made by [CONTACT_566883]’s clinical and radiographic information, and following 
discussion of the risk/benefit with the subject/parent .  The Investigator may 
consult with the spons or and the DMC.  
In addition, bilateral hand -wrist  and knee growth plate morphology will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_566884] (performed every 6 months up to Month 24 in 
Part A, and annually thereafter in Part s B and C ).  Bilateral hip growth plate 
morpholo gy will also be assessed for avascular necrosis in all subjects.  Limb/joint 
AEs in these subjects will be evaluated by [CONTACT_566885].   
 Adverse event severity will be assessed and reported according to criteria defined 
in the protocol (mild, moderate, severe).  
Adverse events known to be associated with retinoids (eg, mucocutaneous events) 
will be further graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE),  Version 4.03, 14 June 2010.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol Synopsis  
 Subjects 8 years of age and older will be assessed for suicidal ideation and 
behavior every 3 months using the age -appropriate C -SSRS and at all visits during 
a Flare -up Cycle.  
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will assess the safety of the subjects 
during the course of the study.  The DMC can recommend temporary or 
permanent stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566850].  The DMC can also make recommendations for potential dose 
modifications for  individual subjects in the event of treatment -related adverse 
bone effects .  The DMC Charter includes recommended safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (see 
Section  7.7). 
Clinical Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_566851]/Study Day 1, a blood sample will be collected and the ACVR1 
gene -coding region will be sequenced to assess for the presence of an 
FOP-associated mutation of the ACVR1 gene for new subjects or for subjects who 
have not undergone previous genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_566852] -1A-001.  Subjects 
enrolling from Study PVO -1A-[ADDRESS_744481] 3 -month safety 
assessments during chronic -based treatment; if samples cannot be obtained during 
the first 3 -month safety assessment, then they can be obtained during any 
subseque nt 3-month safety visit in Part A (ie, up to Month 24).  Pharmacokinetics 
will also be assessed twice during flare-up-based  treatment: once during the [ADDRESS_744482] -dose for the three time points listed above.  
The following palovarotene pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined where 
possible by [CONTACT_566886]™: C max,ss, Cmin,ss, Tmax,ss, 
AUC 0-24ss, λz, t½z, and CL/F.  
Statistical Analysis  Analysis Populations  
The Principal  Enrolled Population (Principal  EP) includes all subjects with the 
R206H ACVR1 mutation who have not previously been treated with palovarotene  
and who sign the in formed consent form and meet all eligibility criteria of the 
MOVE Trial.  
The Principal  Full Analysis Set (Principal  FAS)  includes all enrolled subjects in 
the Principal EP who have a baseline HO volume measurement and at least one 
post-baseline HO volume m easurement in the MOVE Trial.  For efficacy 
comparisons to the NHS, the Principal FAS will also include subjects enrolled in 
the NHS with available baseline and at least one post -baseline HO volume 
measurements.  
 The Principal  Per-Protocol Set (Principal PPS)  is a subset of the Principal FAS 
including subjects with no major protocol deviations that are expected to interfere 
with assessments of the primary endpoint, and with at least 80% compliance to the 
study drug regimen, assessed over the fir st [ADDRESS_744483] -baseline HO volume

measurement and with no major protocol deviations over 2 4 months that are 
expected to interfere with assessments of the primary endpoint.  
The Principal  Safety Set (Principal  SS) includes all enrolled subjects receiving 
at least one dose of palovarotene in the MOVE Trial.  For safety comparisons to 
the NHS, the Principal SS will also include subjects enrolled in the NHS with 
available post -baseline follow -up.  
The Principal  Pharmacokinetic Set (Principal  PS) includes all enrolled subjects 
receiving at least one dose of palovarotene and providing evaluable 
pharmac okinetics data in the MOVE Trial.  
Statistical Analysis (cont.)  Subjects who do not have the R206H ACVR1 mutation or who have received 
previous treatment with palovarotene in PVO -1A-202 or PVO -1A-204 will 
comprise the Supplementary EP , the Supplementary FAS , the Supplementary 
PPS, the Supplementary SS , and the Supplementary PS , with these populations 
defined analogously as above for the subjects with the R206H ACVR1 mutation.  
 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the annualized change in new HO volume (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_6398] -dose WBCT, excluding head) over [ADDRESS_744484] interim analysis will occur when 35 subjects complete 1 -year of follow -up; 
the second and third interim analyses will occur when all subjects enrolled in the 
Principal E P have completed (ie, have WBCT data) [ADDRESS_744485] in the 
current study.   
 An O’Brien -Flemi ng alpha spending function will be used to specify the alpha 
level threshold for determination of treatment effect significance at each interim 
analysis and the final analysis.  Using the percentage of patient years of follow -up 
as an approximation to the statistical information available at each analysis and 
assuming a one -sided, overall type I error rate of 2.5%, the one -sided significance 
thresholds are 0.0058, 0.0103, 0.0156, and 0.[ADDRESS_744486] HO 
volumes from the NHS, and the observed efficacy of palovarotene treatment in the 
Phase 2 studies.  With the NHS contributing untreated follow -up information on 
approximately 90 subjects, and 80  subjects originally planned for enrollment into 
the current study in the Principal FAS population (including approximately 45 
from the NHS), the probability of declaring statistical signi ficance is 0.51, 0.79, 
0.[ADDRESS_744487] interim analyses, respectively, if palovarotene 
treatment reduces the mean number of body regions with new HO in 1 year by 
30%, and reduces the new HO volume conditional on new HO in a body region  by 
50% compared to the NHS control group.  The overall power of the study is 0.92. 
The increase in the number of enrolled subjects will not substantially change the 
power of the trial or have a significant impact on the primary or secondary 
statistical an alyses.

traumatic event  is confirmed by [CONTACT_737].  Flare -up-based  treatment can begin immediately after the Investigator 
confirms the presence of an eligible flare -up or traumatic  and prior to availability of safety laboratory results, unless the 
Investigator determines that the results are required prior to treatment initiation (eg, clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory test results requiring follow -up). 
8 A flare -up, or substantial high -risk traumatic event likely to lead to a flare -up, will be treated with a minim um of 4 weeks 
(28 days) of 20 mg palovarotene, followed by 8  weeks (56 days) of 10 mg palovarotene (or weight -based equivalent) for a 
total of 12 weeks (84  days).  If the flare -up has not resolved after [ADDRESS_744504] experience an intercurrent flare -up, or substantial high -risk traumatic event likely to lead to a flare -up, at 
any time during flare-up-based  treatment, the 12 -week (84 day) dosing regimen will restart u pon confirmation by [CONTACT_3786] (ie, 4 weeks of 20 mg palovarotene followed by 8 weeks of 10  mg palovarotene [or weight -based equivalents]).  
This may occur more than once during a Flare -up Cycle.  
10 Flare -up status will be assessed at Flare -up Day 1 for every flare -up and flare -up end date will be recorded when a flare -up 
resolves.  Flare -up status will also be assessed at Week 12 of the initial flare -up (if only one flare -up) or the last ongoing 
intercurrent flare -up (if more than one flare-up); if any flare -up is still ongoing, the on -going flare -up(s) will be assessed

Treatments are aimed at the symptomatic management of the dis ease.  Removal of heterotopic 
bone  and other trauma are  avoided . Surgical trauma to tissues is likely to induce additional bone 
formation ;3,8 and intramuscular immunizations ; blocks for dental work ; muscle fatigue ; blunt 
muscle trauma from bumps, bruises,  or falls; or influenza -like viral illnesses can trigger flar e-ups 
leading to HO formation.9  Falls are a severe form of trauma; in one survey of FOP patients, 
flare-ups were induced in two -thirds of falls and resulted in permanent loss of movement in 93% 
of patients.Error! Reference source not found.  Glucocorticoids are used to manage symptoms of flare -ups 
affecting major joints of the appendicular skeleton and jaw, especially when used immedia tely 
after the onset of a flare -up.  Non-steroidal a nti-inflammatory agents , cyclooxygenase -[ADDRESS_744524] cell stabilizers, and leukotriene inhibitors are reported by [CONTACT_566894].  
The identification of the recurrent point mutation that causes FOP in all clas sically affected

1.1.3 Overview of Palovarotene  
Palovarotene is 4 -[(E)-2-(5,5,8,8 -tetramethyl -3-pyrazol -1-ylmet hyl-5,6,7,8 -tetrahydro -
naphthalen -2-yl)-vinyl] -benzoic acid .  Palovarotene is an orally bioavailable retinoic acid 
receptor gamma (RARγ) selective agonist in-licensed from [COMPANY_002] following the completion of 
Phase 2 studies in COPD patients (program disconti nued due to lack of efficacy), and is being 
developed by [CONTACT_566896] . as a re -purposed drug for the treatment of FOP.  
RARγ agonists potently impair heterotopic endochondral ossification by [CONTACT_566897] s (MSCs) to a non osseous soft  tissue fate .  The rationale 
for testing retinoids as inhibitors of HO was based on the observation that retinoid signaling is a 
strong inhibitor of chondrogenesisError! Reference source not found. and that unliganded RAR 
transcriptional repressor activity is needed for chondrogenic differentiation.14,15  Inhibition of HO 
with non -selective retinoids or RARα receptor agonists has also been achieved but to a lesser 
degree.Error! Reference source not found. 
RARγ is expressed in chondrogenic cells and chondrocytesError! Reference source not found. where it 
also operates as an unliganded transcriptional repressor.Error! Reference source not found.  Hence, a n 
RARγ agonist -based anti -HO therapy could be very effective because it would target both 
chondrogenic cells and chondrocytes .  It has been shown that RARγ agonists exert their action 
on bone formation through post -translational regulation of BMP signaling by [CONTACT_566898] -regulated degradation of Smads specific to the BMP 
signaling pathway .  Thus, RARγ agonists could directly prevent the activating mutation in the 
BMP type I receptor of FOP patients .  Inhibition of both prechondrogenic and chondrogenic cells 
is also thought to occur through possible stimulation of Wnt -β-catenin signaling.18,19

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  The process of HO consists of two major phases: a catabolic phase of inflammation and tissue 
destruction followed by [CONTACT_566899] a 
transient cartilaginous scaffold and its replacement with mature heterotopic bone .  A key feature 
of all HO is the formation of a bridging cartilaginous scaffold that i s under control of the BMP 
and possibly the Wnt -β-catenin signaling pathways .  RARγ ag onists affect  both BMP and 
Wnt-β-catenin signaling and interfere with the building of the cartilaginous scaffold, thereby

Palovarotene has been evaluated in various animal models of HO including a BMP -implant 
model, a constitutively -active receptor model (Q207D ), and a highly physiological human 
mutation knock -in model (R206H ).  Following injury, the results consistently demo nstrate 
dose-dependent reductions in HO with palovarotene across the models, and significant reduction 
in spontaneous (non -injury) HO with chronic treatment.  T he data from the injury -based Q207D 
mouse model of FOP demonstrated that a human equivalent dose  (HED) of [ADDRESS_744526] inhibition of HO across all injury conditions.  
In addition  to the injury -based model, palovarotene has also been effective in preventing HO 
formation in a spontaneous HO model ( Prrx1 -R206H  model ) that recapi[INVESTIGATOR_566856].  An average HED of 
approximately 5 mg palovarotene administered daily by [CONTACT_566901]1 -R206H  mice 
markedly reduced the formation of sp ontaneous HO, suggesting that daily dosing with 
palovarotene may be an important component of the treatment regimen in humans.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical  Data  
The toxicology of palovarotene has been extensively characterized in rodent and non -rodent 
studies , including  single-dose, repeat -dose (sub -chronic and chronic), reproductive toxicity, 
genotoxicity, and phototoxicity studies in support of clinical studies in humans .  Toxicity studies 
of four metabolites of palovarotene were also performed .  A detailed summary of these studies 
and the observed effects is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The toxicology profile of palovarotene in animals is similar to that which is expected for a 
retinoid based on the extensive data available for compoun ds in this class of agents.Error! Reference 
source not found.  The toxic potential of this molecule was evaluated in rats dosed daily for up to 6 
months and in dogs dosed daily for up to 9  months .  Initia l chronic toxicity studies at dose levels 
up to 0.15  mg/kg/day in rats (6 -month study)  and 0.006 mg/kg/day in dogs (9 -month study) did 
not induce any observed palovarotene -related changes .  These studies identified these top doses 
as the no -observed -effect -level for chronic exposure .  Further studies at higher dose levels 
characterized the toxic potential of this molecule after similar chronic administration periods in 
these two species .  The maximum tolerated dose  following chronic exposure was 0.6 mg/kg/d ay 
in rats and 0.04  mg/kg/day in dogs .  Moreover, in order to evaluate the toxicity profile of 
metabolites at high exposure levels, 6 -month studies were conducted in rats and 9 -month studies 
were condu cted in dogs with a mixture of m etabolites M2, M3, M4a,  and M4b given orally .  The 
toxicity profile of these metabolites was similar to that of parent drug in rats and dogs.  
The dose limiting toxicities in adult animals were primarily mucocutaneous effects, with 
mild/moderate and reversible chondrodystrophy ob served at the clinically relevan t dose of 
PROTOCOL PVO -1A-301,  AMENDMENT 5 PAGE 34 OF 151 
CLEMENTIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC. 30 OCTOBER  2020  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  1 mg/kg/day in 7 to 8 -week old rats.  The toxicity of palovarotene has also been evaluated in a 
6-week repeat -dose oral toxicity study in juvenile rats (3 weeks old at the start of dosing).  These 
results did not r eveal any toxicities not observed in older animals, with the primary toxicologic 
effects related to bone.  At a dose level that produced systemic exposures similar to those 
predicted in patients, skeletal effects were relatively limited and mild and showed  evidence of 
reversing when dosing stopped, even though juvenile rats were exposed to palovarotene over a 
period of skeletal development that would be similar to chronic daily dosing from age 2 to 
12 years in humans.  
In rat and dog mass balance studies, re covery of the administered [14C]-palovarotene dose was 
complete within [ADDRESS_744527] 
24 hours after dosing, was exclusively biliary/fecal .  At least 68% and 50% of the administered 
dose was absorbed in rats and dogs, respectively.   After the once -daily [14C]-palovarotene oral 
dose administration for [ADDRESS_744528] human CYP450 3A4 were very high (>100 µM) .  The 
oxidative metabolism of the parent drug was p rimarily by [CONTACT_097]450 3A4.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical  Data  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Palovarotene Pharmacokinetics  
The data describing the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of palovarotene are based on 
12 completed Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects, including a single 
ascending dos e study; a multiple ascending dose study; five drug -drug interaction (DDI) studies 
with ketoconazole (a strong cytochrome P450 [CYP] 3A4 inhibitor), rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513] (a strong 
CYP3A4 inducer), inhibition and induction potential with midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate ), and 
prednisone (a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor); a bioequivalence study; a [14C]-radiolabeled single -dose 
mass balance study; a single -dose age and sex study; a single -dose bridging study in Japanese 
and non -Asian subjects; a definitive food-effect/mode of administration study (as part of the 
midazolam induction potential study mentioned above); a thorough QT study  and a study 
evaluating the concentration of palovarotene in seminal fluid .  Pharmacokinetic data were also 
collected in two m ultiple -dose studies in subjects with COPD, and three multiple -dose studies in 
subjects with FOP (one completed Phase 2 study, one ongoing Phase 2 study, and one ongoing 
Phase 3 study).  A population PK model was developed for palovarotene using data obtai ned 
after single - and multiple -dose oral administration to healthy volunteers and subjects with COPD 
and FOP . 
To date,  over [ADDRESS_744529] one dose of palovarotene across the following 
indications:  
PROTOCOL PVO -1A-301,  AMENDMENT 5 PAGE 35 OF 151 
CLEMENTIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC. 30 OCTOBER  2020  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  • 309 healthy volunteers received sin gle or multiple doses between 0.02 and 50 mg for up 
to 4 weeks  
• 611 subjects with COPD received multiple doses between 0.2 and 5 mg daily for up to 24 
months  
• 164 subjects with FOP received multiple doses between 2.5 and 20 mg once daily for up 
to 4 years, and  
• approximately 129 subjects with MO received multiple doses of 2.5 or 5.0 mg once daily 
for up to 18 months.  In addition, seven FOP subjects received palovarotene in an early 
access program (EAP)   
In healthy subjects, the palovarotene pharmacokinetics were linear and dose -proportional up to a 
single dose of [ADDRESS_744530] populations; the mean 
terminal half -life ranged from 9.7 to 13 hours.  Palovarotene was absorbed and eliminated in a 
similar manner for both populations, and pharmacokinetic parameters were similar at both dose 
levels based on geometric mean ratios and CIs for C max, AUC (0-∞), and AUC (0-t). 
Palovarotene was primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4.  Five metabolites, 6,7 -dihydroxy (M1), 6 -
hydroxy (M2), 7 -hydroxy (M3), 6 -oxo (M4a), and 7 -oxo (M4b) were observed for palovaroten e 
in the clinical pharmacology studies.  M1 was present in very low concentrations, usually below 
the limit of quantification (LOQ).  Following administration of 14C-radiolabeled palovarotene, 
97% of the dose was recovered in the feces and 3.2% in the urin e.  Overall, the metabolite profile 
was qualitatively similar to that reported in all the animal species.  
In healthy subjects, palovarotene exposure at steady  state increased approximately three -fold 
with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), decreased  approximately 10 -fold with 
rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513] (a strong CYP3A4 inducer), decreased slightly by 14% with prednisone (a weak 
CYP3A4 inhibitor), and did not change consistently with midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate).  
Palovarotene did not impact the pharmacokinetics of  concomitantly administered drugs, 
including oral prednisone  and midazolam . 
Co-administration of palovarotene with food resulted in a 40% increase in AUC 0-∞ and a 16% 
increase in C max compared with administration under fasted conditions. Additionally, T max 
appeared to be slightly shorter for fasted subjects dosed with palovarotene.   Opening the capsule 
and sprinkling the contents onto soft food did not affect the PK of palovarotene.  No clinically

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  A population PK model was used to simulate palovarotene administration in pediatric patients in 
order to assess the appropriateness of weight -based dosing in skeletal ly immature children.  The 
simulations identified weight -adjusted doses that provide derived steady -state exposures 
(AUC 0-τ, Cmax,ss, and C min,ss) within the range of those for adults after receiving  the 10- and 
20-mg doses.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_744531] received treatment  include:   
• Study PVO -1A-201 provided a preliminary assessment of palovarotene efficacy across 
two different dosing regimens following 6 weeks of tr eatment for a flare -up relative to 
placebo  (ie, flare-up only regimen) .  Forty s ubjects were randomized (3:3 :2) within 
1 week of a flare -up to receive either 10 mg palovarotene daily for 2 weeks  followed by 
5 mg daily for 4weeks  (10/5  mg); 5 mg palovaroten e for 2 weeks  followed by 2.5 mg for 
4 weeks  (5/2.5 mg); or placebo for 6 weeks .  After the 6 -week  flare-up treatment period, 
subjects be gan a 6 -week follow -up period during which no study drug was administered.   
• Study PVO -1A-202/Part A, an open -label ext ension of Study PVO -1A-201, evaluated the 
long-term safety and efficacy of prior palovarotene t reatment after an additional 
[ADDRESS_744532] acebo during Study PVO -1A-201, experiencing additional 
eligible flare -ups (ie, flare-up only regimen s).  Subjects were treated with high dose 
palovarotene (10 mg palovarotene for 2 weeks  followed by 5 mg for 4 weeks ) regimen 
for 6 weeks, followed b y a 6 -week period in which no study drug was administered.  
• Study PVO -1A-202/Part B (corresponds to Study PVO -1A-204 in [LOCATION_009]) included 
chronic daily doses (5 mg) of palovarotene in subjects with at least 90% skeletal 
maturity.  During a flare -up, all subjects received higher dose/longer duration treatment 
with pa lovarotene (20  mg for 4 weeks followed by 10 mg for 8 weeks).  This 
“chronic/flare -up” regimen is the dosing regimen employed in the current study.  
• Study PVO -1A-202/Part C (corresponds to Study PVO -1A-204 in [LOCATION_009], ongoing) 
extends the chronic/flare -up palovarotene regimen to all subjects, includin g skeletally 
immature children . 
Preliminary data from the Phase 2 program and the NHS  is based on 150 prospectively assessed 
flare-ups.  Administration of the 20/10  mg palovarotene flare-up regimen  resulted in a  72% 
reduction in new HO volume relative to untreated flare -ups.  The results were similar with the 
10/5 mg flare-up regimen (75% reduction).  There was a 48% reduction in new HO volume in 
flare-ups treated with the 20/10  mg chronic/flare -up regimen.  The proportion of flare -ups with 
any new HO  was lowest with the 20/10  mg chronic/flare -up regimen  (21%) versus the other 
regimens (untreated: 34%, 10/5 flare-up: 29%, 20/10 flare-up: 41%); the 20/10 mg 
chronic/flare -up regimen also had  the lowest incidence of flare-ups with  baseline  edema .

The global addendum (dated 15Apr2020) to Study PVO -1A-[ADDRESS_744543] visit assessments that could not be done per protocol were to be reported as deviations.  
 
Chronic Treatment : Part A  
Subjects will receive orally admin istered 5 mg palovarotene  once  daily (weight -adjusted for 
skeletally immature subjects [ie, subjects under the age of 18  years with less than 90% skeletal 
maturity on hand -wrist  radiography at Screening] ; see Table 4) for chronic dosing for up to 
48 months.  Note: all weight -based dosing, both chronic and flare -up, will cease when subjects 
achieve ≥90% skeletal maturity based on hand -wrist  radiography, but radiographic assessment of 
the growth plate (performed at Months 6, 12, 18, and 24 ) will continue until these subjects 
achieve 100% closure of the growth plate at both locations.   Additional radiographic assessments 
will be perf ormed at Study Months 3, 9, 15, or 21 in those subjects who (1)  received the flare -up 
dosing regimen in the period of time since their last radiographic  assessment; and (2)  had not 
achieved 100% skeletally maturity on their last radiographic assessment.  For 5 mg palovarotene, 
weight equivalent doses for <20 kg, 20  to <40 kg, 40 to <60 kg, and ≥[ADDRESS_744544] (excluding 
head) at Screening and at site visits at Months 6, 12, 18, and 24.   
In order to ensure co nsistent interpretation of the acquired images, a central imaging laboratory 
will perform blinded reads of all images obtained in this study as well as those obtained from the 
natural history study (control group) using standardized procedures  as documente d in the Image 
Acquisition Guidelines and Independent Review Charter .  Remote visits (eg, at home, at a local 
medical facility, or via video -conference or telephone contact [CONTACT_566880]) will 
occur at Week 6 and at Study Months 3, 9, 15, an d 21 unless the Investigator deems that a site 
visit is necessary; urine pregnancy tests will be performed each month for females of 
childbearing potential (FOCBP).  
Chronic Treatment: Part B  
The assessments and procedures conducted in Part A will continue into Part B except that 
WBCT imaging will be performed annually at Months 36 and 48.  
Flare -up-based  Treatment : Parts A and B  
Subjects and/or their parents/caregivers will report potential flare -up symptoms to site personnel; 
such symptoms include, but are not limited to, pain, swelling, redness, decreased range of 
motion, stiffness, and warmth.  Only one symptom is required to define a flare -up.  If these 
symptoms are consistent with previous flare -ups, include a subject -reported onset date, and are 
confirmed by [CONTACT_566881] a flare -up, subjects will immediately begin 
flare-up-based  treatment .

3.[ADDRESS_744549] contributed to the understanding of FOP disease progression, the risk 
factors leading to HO formation, and the potential utility of palovarotene in preventing HO 
formation.  
PROTOCOL PVO -1A-301,  AMENDMENT 5 PAGE 43 OF 151 
CLEMENTIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC. 30 OCTOBER  2020  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  FOP is  a disease that is characterized by [CONTACT_566903], vaccinations, or influenza infections.   The HO accumulates throughout life, resulting in 
segments, sheets, and ribbons of extra bone throughout the body and across joints, progressively 
restricting movement.  While HO formation may be preceded by [CONTACT_566904] a 
flare-up such as pain, swelling, redness, decreased range of motion, stiffness, and warmth, the 
biological process that results in the formati on of HO may begin before the onset of symptoms.  
Thus, the optimal treatment for FOP might be similar to other chronic diseases that are 
characterized by [CONTACT_566905]/relapses, followed by [CONTACT_72246] -length periods of apparent 
disease quiescence (eg,  relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis) during which clinical symptoms 
are not observed.  It is hypothesized that daily treatment in the absence of flare-up symptoms, 
which will ensure exposure to palovarotene when the endochondral process starts, together  with 
increasing the dose immediately upon symptom onset  (the chronic/flare -up regimen) , may be a 
better approach than treating only when clinical symptoms are present  (the flare -up only 
regimen) . 
Under the original protocol, subjects from the NHS and new subjects clinically diagnosed with 
FOP with the R206H ACVR1 mutation (who had not previously participated in any Clementia 
study ) were eligible for enrollment .  In addition to these subjects, this study  (under 
Amendment  1) will allow for the enrollment of new subjects with other FOP mutations .  This 
will enable  these subjects , who also experience progressive HO, to receive treatment with  
palovarotene.  Amendment 1 will also allow for the enrollment of Study  PVO -1A-202 or 
Study  PVO -1A-204 subjects who cannot currently receive the chronic/flare -up regimen due to 
country of residence or those traveling long distances to participate in the Phase  [ADDRESS_744550] populations shou ld match as closely as possible 
between the two studies.  Subjects with FOP mutations  other than R206H will not be included in 
the primary analysis due to the limited number of patients with these mutations  (estimated as 3% 
of the world’s known FOP populat ion of approximately 800 individuals – or approximately 24 
subjects) and because the NHS only enrolled subjects with the R206H ACVR1 mutation .  
Subjects who previously participated in the palovarotene Phase [ADDRESS_744551] burden.  
The study was extended in Part B for an additional 24 months in order to provide the 
chronic/flare -up palovarotene dosing regimen to all subject s until commercial availability; and to 
obtain longer -term safety data.  
As of 04Dec2019, all subjects < 14 years of age were required to i nterrupt study drug due to a 
partial clinical hold placed on the PVO clinical development program by [CONTACT_55257]. Treatment

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  will subsequently not be restarted in children < 14 years of age  as subjects remained off 
treatment for such a prolonged period of ti me as to render any further data to inform additional 
benefit/risk uninterpretable in this patient population . 
Part C was added t o implement safety measures based on DMC recommendations , given the 
serious identified risk of premature physeal closure , in order to ensure that assessments of safety 
continue for up to [ADDRESS_744552] dose of study  treatment in Part A/B for skeletally immature 
subjects , who stopped treatment for any reason . 
3.3 Dose Justification  
FOP is an extremely rare, chronic, severely disabling disease characterized by [CONTACT_566906][INVESTIGATOR_566857] -ups and the formation of HO that is 
irreversible and the disability is permanent.  Because the risks of under -treatment are very high 
FOP should be t reated aggressively in order to evaluate the maximal potential treatment benefit, 
while carefully monitoring for potential safety concerns.  The dose regimens selected for the 
current study address these aspects of the disease and are based on emerging non clinical and 
clinical data:  
• Chronic dosing regimen:  In a non -injury -based  mouse model of FOP that recapi[INVESTIGATOR_566858], including spontaneous HO 
formation, chronic daily treatment with palovarotene at an HED of approximately 5  mg 
prevented HO formation.  Importantly in this R206H FOP -relevant animal model, the 
dosing regimen did not impair long bone growth but partially normalized the abnormal 
growth plate histology and shortened long bones that are key phenotypi c features of this 
model.  The results raised the possibility that chronic daily palovarotene dosing may be a 
major component of an optimized clinical dosing strategy.   
• Flare -up dosing regimen:  The rationale for increasing the chronic palovarotene dose at  
the time of a flare -up comes from both the animal pharmacology and available clinical 
trial results.  The nonclinical data from two different mouse models of FOP demonstrated 
a dose -related decrease in HO volume; and suggested that flare-up-based  treatmen t using 
an HED of 20  mg may be necessary to optimally prevent HO following an injury 
(equivalent to a flare -up in humans).  The Phase 2 program has evaluated four different 
palovarotene dosing regimens, three flare-up-based  epi[INVESTIGATOR_566859]/flare -up regimen.  Preliminary clinical data on 103 prospectively assessed 
flare-ups demonstrated an approximate 45% reduction in the proportion of flare -ups with 
new HO, and an approximate 75% decrease in new HO volume, in those flare -ups trea ted 
with palovarotene 10/5  mg over 6  weeks compared to placebo/untreated flare -ups; and an 
approximate 65% reduction in proportion of flare -ups with new HO and an approximate 
98% reduction in HO volume in those flare -ups treated with the chronic/flare -up regimen 
20/10 mg over 12  weeks (the regimen in the current study) compared to 
placebo/untreated flare -ups.  These data provide a strong rationale for the continued 
evaluation of palovarotene as a potential treatment of FOP, and the selection of chronic 
daily administration of 5 mg palovarotene, with dose escalation to 20 mg once daily for 
4 weeks followed by 10 mg for 8 weeks (with treatment extension possible per

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  Investigator discretion for persistent flare -ups) for all subjects.  The dosage will be 
adjuste d for weight in skeletally immature children.   
• While it is recognized that flare -ups can occur in the absence of any apparent causative 
factor, there is a high risk that substantial traumatic events such as surgery ; intramuscular 
immunization ; mandibular blocks for dental work ; muscle fatigue ; blunt muscle trauma 
from bumps, bruises,  or falls; or influenza -like viral illnesses can induce flare -ups and 
progressive HO formation.9  In one survey of FOP patients, flare -ups were induced in 
two-thirds of falls and resulted in permanent loss of movement in 93% of patients.Error! 
Reference source not found.  Thus, subjects experiencing substantial high -risk traumatic events 
that the Investigators deem likely to lead to a flare -up will be treated with the flare -up 
regimen.  
It is acknowledged that palo varotene plasma exposure in humans receiving treatment with this 
regimen will be similar to or greater than the threshold for adverse effects in juvenile rats, adult 
rats, or adult dogs.  The toxicological effects were primarily mucocutaneous (in adult ani mals) 
and skeletal (in juvenile animals after chronic exposure).  Current safety monitoring  in the 
Phase  [ADDRESS_744553] common finding was dense metaphyseal lines in approximately 70% 
of subjects at both baseline and post -baseline time points .  Premature epi[INVESTIGATOR_566860] [ADDRESS_744554] been util ized in patients presenting with soft

radionuclide bone scan.Error! Reference source not found.  Most are performed at the time of the initial 
flare-up as part of the diagnostic evaluation and prior to the diagnosis of FOP.  Following the 
accurate diagnosis of FOP, imaging is not routinely p erformed4 as such imaging does not play a 
role in the supportive care offered to patients.  Although most of the experience with 
documentation of HO following a flare -up has been with x -ray, it has been noted that CT scans 
may allow earlier detection of new areas o f HO.Error! Reference source not found. 
Flare -up site, low -dose CT scan was found to be more sensitive to the detection and 
quantification of new HO following a flare -up in the initial interventional Phase 2 study 
(PVO -1A-201) compared to plain radiograph.  The Natural History Study (PVO -1A-001) 
demonstrated the utility of whole body CT scan (WBCT ) at documenting the presence, location, 
and quantification of whole body HO, including new HO formation at [ADDRESS_744555] scan (excluding 
head).

3.4.2 Measures of Functional Disability and General Health  
Two key measures of functional disability include:  
• The Cumulative Analogue Joint Involvement Scale (CAJIS) for FOP is an objective 
measure of j oint movement completed by [CONTACT_566907].  This scale, which was developed by [CONTACT_566908], assesses functional disability by [CONTACT_566909] n across 12 joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, ankle on both right 
and left), and three body regions (cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [neck], thoracic/lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_566862]) 
with each joint/region assessed as: 0=uninvolved; 1=affected; 2=functionally ankylosed.  
The total score range is 0 -30.  The CAJIS is provided in Appendix 1. 
• The FOP -Physical Function Questionnaire (FOP -PFQ) is a disease -specific 
patient -reported outcome measure of physical impairment.  The FOP -PFQ was developed 
by [CONTACT_566910], “Patient Reported Outcome 
Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims”.  This 
patient -reported outcome instrument was developed to assess the relationship between 
patient reports of physical impairment due to HO, thereby [CONTACT_566911] a 
clinically meaningful endpoint.  Age -appropriate forms provide a measure of functional 
impairment experience d by [CONTACT_566912].  These data are analyzed as a percent of the total 
possible score, with higher percentages representing greater functional impairment.  The 
adult and pediat ric versions of the FOP -PFQ are provided in Appendix 2. 
The baseline data from the  Natural History Study (PVO -1A-001) demonstrated clear correlations 
of these endpoints with age, but minimal to no change over 12 months.Error! Reference source not found.

• Synthetic oral retinoids other than palovarotene are not permitted in the [ADDRESS_744570] day of treatment . 
• Concomitant use of tetracyclines and retinoids has been associated with benign 
intracranial hypertension .  Therefore, use of tetracycline  or tetracycline derivatives  is 
prohibited during the study .  If the subject experience s a medical condition that requires

Dose modification may also be required due to potential bone  safety findings as described in  the 
Bone Safety Management Plan ( see Section 7.3.3 ).  
If the subject does not have the proper dosage strength in his/her possession, the clinical site will 
make immediate arrangements to ship the appropriate study drug to the subject.  If the  subject is

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  allow the screening process to begin pr ior to the initial site visit, should the Investigator deem it 
relevant.  
As per the global addendum (dated 15 Apr2020 ) to Study PVO -1A-301 Amendment 4,  
Investigators , in consultation with their site IRB/EC , are required to inform subjects of the 
temporary c hanges (during the COVID -19 global pandemic) to the study conduct and monitoring 
plans that could impact them and their willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The 
method of communication to subjects (e.g., email, phone call, information lette r) and 
documentation of subject/caregiver acknowledgement is to be performed and documented in 
accordance with local regulations/EC requests and guidance. All contacts with subjects must be 
filed in the source records.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_744585] is unable to 
undergo a procedure due to safety concerns (eg, risk of flare -up) or physical limitation (pain or 
locked position).  
7.2.[ADDRESS_744586].  
For subjects receiving flare-up-based  treatment, the flare-up assessment  will include current 
flare-up location, symptoms, and probable cause  documented on Flare -up Day 1 . 
7.2.2 Physical Examination  
A physical examination of all body systems is to be documented at Screening and every 
6 months in Part A (Months 6, 12, 18, and 24) and Part B (Months 30, 36, 42, and 48), Part A or 
B EOT/EOS and Part C (Years [ADDRESS_744587] dose of study treatmen t) for each subject.  
The physical examina tion will monitor for objective changes and for possible adverse reac tions 
associated with therapy.   Any post -baseline abnormal physical exam ination  findings assessed as 
clinically significant will be recorded as ad verse events.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_744588] b ody weight assessed  at Screening and every 3 months  in Part A  (Months 
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24) and Part B (Months 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48) , Part A or B 
EOT/EOS and Part C (Years [ADDRESS_744589] dose of study treatment ).   
For subjects receiving flare-up-based  treatment  in Parts A and B , body weight will  also be 
recorded at Flare -up Cycle Safety Day [ADDRESS_744590] linear growth assessments (in triplicate) by [CONTACT_566917] (in 
triplicate) at Screening and  every 6  months (Months 6, 12, 18, and 24).  Once a subject is 
18 years old, triplicate linear growth and knee height assessments will no longer be required.   
The 6 -month assessments of linear growth in subjects under the age of 18 years will continue in 
Part B (Months 30, 36, 42, and 48) , Part A or B EOT/EOS and Part C (Years [ADDRESS_744591] dose of study treatment ) 
Linear growth measurements will be performed by [CONTACT_126840] q ualified study personnel  at the 
same time of day for each assessment , if possible .  The stadiometric measurement instructions 
will include practices that reduce measurement error including calibration of equipment, proper 
subject positioning, and measureme nt capture.  The same examiner should be used whenever 
possible to  standardize the performance of procedures and  minimize the inter -examiner 
variability.  Measurement of knee height will also be standardized.  
In addition, the length of bilateral tibia and femur will be assessed by [CONTACT_566918] 
6 months  up to Month 24  in Part A;  and annually up to Month 48  in Part B ; and annually in the 
NHS.  
7.2.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and heart rate) will be assessed  at 
Screening and  every 3 months in Part A (Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 ) and Part B 
(Months 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48) , Part A or B EOT/EOS and Part C (Years [ADDRESS_744592] dose of study  treatment ) for each subject.    
For subje cts receiving flare-up-based  treatment  in Parts A and B , vital signs will be assessed at 
Flare -up Cycle Safety Day [ADDRESS_744593] 5 minutes .  Automatic blood pressure devices are not 
allowed due to the risk of over -inflation and potential tissue injury.   To minimize the potential 
for a flare -up at the cuff site when measuring blood pressure, pump the cuff slowly to a 
maximum of 140 mm Hg.  DO NOT measure  blood pressure on an arm with a flare-up. 
7.2.5 Electrocardiogram  
A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at Screening and every 6 months in 
Part A (Months  6, 12, 18, and 24) , Part B (Months 30, 36, 42, and 48) , and Part A or B 
EOT/EOS  for each subject .   
To ensure consist ent generation and interpretation of results,  a central ECG l aboratory will 
perform the  analysis using standardized procedures .  The Investigator will be provided ECG 
interpretation s from the central ECG lab oratory,  and will review and assess all abnormal results 
for clinical significance.  Any post -baseline ECG abnormalities assessed as clinically signific ant 
will be recorded as AE s.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  7.2.6 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for hematology, biochemistry  (includes l ipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] ), and 
urinalysis testing at Screening and every 6 months  in Part A  (Months 6, 12, 18, and 24) , Part B 
(Months 30,  36, 42, and 48) , and Part A or B EOT/EOS  for each subject . 
For subjects receiving flare-up-based  treatment  in Parts A and B , blood and urine samples will be 
collected  at Flare -up Cycle Safety Day [ADDRESS_744594] always be performed monthly  during chronic  treatment; and at the start of each flare-up 
cycle  and every [ADDRESS_744595] was performed within 4  weeks prior to 
the start of a flare -up or traumatic event , treatment of the flare -up or traumatic event  will not be 
delayed pending  repeat pregnanc y testing.   
Blood and urine samples may be collected  remotely (eg,  at the subject’s home ) by [CONTACT_566919] a local medical facility according to standard operating procedures and 
applicable regulations.  When possible, samples will be col lected under fasting conditions.  
Samples will be packaged and shipped to the designated  laboratory for testing .  To ensure 
consist ent generation and interpretation of results,  a central testing laboratory will p erform the  
analysis of  clinical laboratory sampl es.  If results are needed promptly (eg, Screening for 
eligibility), testing can be completed at a local, qualified laboratory.   If urinalysis results are 
abnormal, a  microscopic evaluation will be completed . 
The total blood volume drawn from a subjec t over the course of the entire study  (48 months ) will 
range from  approximately 66 mL (in the case of no flare -ups) to 182 mL (in the case of  two 
expected flare-ups treated per year, or a total of eight  flare-ups treated during the entire study).  
In the event that the total drawn blood volume exceeds the limits established by [CONTACT_566920], then  priority will be given to the key safety lab oratory test s, as outlined in 
the clinical safety laboratory manual .  This will ensure that the total blood volume drawn is 
within the established limits.  
The Investigator will be provided  all laboratory results and  will review and assess out -of-range 
findings for clinical significance.   Any post-baseline abnormal laboratory value assessed a s 
clinically significant will be recorded as an AE.   It is recognized that performing phlebotomy in 
subjects with FOP is very challenging due to their multiple ankyloses and the potential to cause 
injury resulting in a flare -up following multiple attempts.   The Investigator will be notified about 
any protocol -specified safety laboratory test that could not  be obtained despi[INVESTIGATOR_566863] s.  Should this occur, or for those samples that were drawn but were not usable (eg, 
quantity not sufficient, clotted, sample lost, etc .), the Investigator will assess the subject’s 
condition and determine whether repeated attempts should be made  to obtain the missing 
PROTOCOL PVO -1A-301,  AMENDMENT [ADDRESS_744596]’s current clinical status (eg, AEs, vital signs) and previous laboratory measures.

Definitions, documentation,  and reporting of AEs  are described in Section  9.1.  Serious adverse 
events  must be reported within 24 hours  as described in Section 9.1.8 . 
7.2.9 Concomitant Medications  
Prior/c oncomitant medications will be assessed at every site and remote visit during chronic 
treatment , flare-up-based  treatment , Part A or B EOT/EOS and Part C  (Year s [ADDRESS_744599] dose of study treatment) . 
See Section 5.2 for restrictions for concomitant medications.  
7.3 Special Safety Assessments  
In light of the established safety profile of the currently marketed oral systemic  retinoids  and 
hypothesized potential concerns , clinica l and laborato ry monito ring of selected AEs and 
laboratory abnormalities in subjects in this study is indicated.  The following  potential safety 
issues will be monito red in the study. 
7.3.1 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
In accordance with the Guidance for Industry: Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: Prospective 
Assessment of Occurrence in Clinical Trials, 2012, a ll subjects 8 years of age  and older  who are 
receiving palovarotene will be assessed  for suicidal ideati on and behavior using the C -SSRS  (see 
Appendix 5A) at Screening and every 3 months  in Part A  (Months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24) ; 
in Part B (Months 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48)  and Part A or B EOT/EOS  and as part of 
every Flare -Up Cycle Safety Assessment  in Parts A and B .   
The adult form will be used for subjects 12 years and older and the pediatric form will be used 
for subjects 8 to 11  years old  (see Appendix 5B).  Study personnel administering the 
questionnaire will receive formal training to ensure accuracy and consistency in application of 
the instrument.  
Any subject reporting a type [ADDRESS_744600]  Radiographs  
Due to the potential for palovarotene to cause  adverse  effects on long -bone growth , subjects  
under the age of 18 years  at the time of enrollment  (Screening)  with open epi[INVESTIGATOR_566865] -up knee (AP view) and hand -wrist  radiographs  (PA view , preferable on the left side ) 
every 6  months in Part A (Months 6, 12, 18, and 24), Part B (Months 30, 36, 42, and 48)  and Part 
A or B EOT/EOS . Subjects who are skeletally immature at the time of study drug 
discontinuation and entering  Part C (Y1 and Y2 or SC post last dose of study  treatment ) will 
have  follow -up knee (AP view) and hand -wrist  radiographs (PA view, preferable on the left side) 
every  year.  Additional radiographic assessments will be performed every 3 months in Parts A 
and B  in those subjects who (1)  received the flare -up dosing regimen in the period of time since 
their last radiographic assessment; and (2) had not achieved 100% skeletally maturity on their 
last radiographic assessment.   
Subjects enrolling from the NHS and Phase [ADDRESS_744601] radiographs repeated at 
Screening.   At the Screening/Study Day [ADDRESS_744602]’s skeletal maturity so that dosing can be determined while the subject  is on site, sites may 
have the subject’s bone age also assessed by [CONTACT_566924] . 
Once a subject has achieved 100% skeletal maturity (defined as closure of all assessed  growth 
plate s) as determi ned by [CONTACT_566925] -wrist  radiographs , furth er radiographs will no longer 
be necessary.   If 100% skeletal maturity is not achiev ed at both locations , then only the location  
that is still maturing would need to be monitored.  
All radiographs  will be read by a central imaging  laboratory  to ensure consistent assessment of 
the radiographs .  The Investigator will be provided all results and will review and assess 
abnormal results for clinical significance.  Any post -baseline abnormal results assessed as 
clinically significant will be record ed as an AE.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_744603] scans from all subjects regardless of age will also monitor hip 
morphology for signs of avascular necrosis (AVN) , warranted d ue to the association of 
corticosteroid s with AVN and the presence of AVN of the femoral head in  wild-type rats treated

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  Safety findings of these bone  images may trigger additional follow -up images and/or dose 
modification, as discussed in the  Bone Safety Management Plan . 
7.3.4 Mucocutaneous Effects (Skin and Mucous Membrane Toxicity Profile)  
At every study visit  during palovarotene treatment , subjects  will be assessed  for AEs, including 
mucocutaneous AEs (eg, dry skin, itching, redness, rash, flaking and peeling of the skin, dry l ips, 
chapped lips, cheilitis, dry eyes , and conjunctivitis) .  In addition to the severity assessments of 
mild, moderate , and severe (Section 9.1.4 ), all mucocutaneous AEs will be rated  according to the 
most recent version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 
4.03, 14 June 2010  (see Appendix 6).  In the event of a subject -report of a mucocutaneous AE, 
dermatologic photographs may be taken for review by a dermatologist.  Permission to obtain 
dermatologi c photographs will be requested in the informed consent/assent document(s).   
If any mucocutaneous effects are observed, symptomatic therapy (eg, analgesics, skin emollients, 
lip moisturizers, artificial tears , or other helpful treatments) may be administer ed if deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_737] .  In addition, the Investigator may recommend prophylactic use of 
these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_566867].  Dose reduction as described in Section 6.[ADDRESS_744604] possible do se, then study drug will 
be discontinued.  
Althou gh palovarotene  has not been  proven  to be phototoxic , precautiona ry measure s for 
phototo xicity are recommended  for subjects who are receiving palovarotene .  Excessiv e exposu re to 
sun should  be avoided  and protection from  sunli ght when  it cannot  be avoided (u se of 
sunscreens , protective clothin g, and use of sunglasses). 
7.3.5 Serum Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]  
A complete lipid profile will be performed as pa rt of the biochemistry testing at Screening and 
every 6 months  in Part A  (Months 6, 12, 18 , and 24) , Part B (Months 30, 36, 42, and 48) , and 
Part A or B EOT/EOS  (excepting Part C) for all subjects . During flare -up-based treatment in 
Parts A/B, a  complete l ipid profile will be performed as part of the biochemistry testing at  Flare -
up Cycle Safety Day [ADDRESS_744605] flare -up or 
traumatic event within a Flare -up Cycle is completed . 
If, during the palovarotene t reatment , serum triglyceride levels are ≥ 800 mg/dL , the study drug  
should be immediately discontinued , with follow -up assessments performed per protocol . 
7.3.6 Liver Enzymes  
Liver enzymes will be monitored as part of the biochemistry testing  at Screening and every 
6 months  in Part A  (Months 6, 12, 18, and 24) , Part B (Months 30, 36, 42, and 48) , and Part A or 
B EOT/EOS  (excepting Part C) for all subjects . During flare -up-based treatment in Parts A/B, a

occur : 
• AST or ALT ≥  5× ULN   
• Jaundice is observed   
• ALT > 3× ULN if accompanied with any bilirubin increase  >2× ULN , unexplained 
abdom inal pain, malaise, nausea, and /or vomiting . 
Liver toxicity evaluation will follow the Guidance for Industry Drug -Induced Liver Injury: 
Premarketing Clinical Evaluation (July 2009)  (Appendix 7). 
7.3.7 Lipase/Amylase  
Amylase and lipase will be monitored as part of the biochemistry testing  at Screening and every 
6 months in Part A (Months 6, 12, 18, and 24) , Part B (Months 30, 36, 42, and 48) , and Part A or 
B EOT/EOS  (excepting Part C) for all subjects . During flare -up-based treatment in Parts A/B, a  
lipase/amylase  profile will be performed as part of the biochemistry testing at  Flare -up Cycle 
Safety Day [ADDRESS_744607] flare -up or traumatic 
event  within a Flare -up Cycle is completed . 
Lipase and /or amylase increases during the course of the study should be further evaluated to 
exclude the occurrence  of pancreatitis .  With symptoms  of panc reatitis  or with persistent  
elevati ons that cannot  be explained , the study drug should  be discontinued  as per the 
Investi gator’s  judgment , with follow -up assessments performed per protocol . 
7.3.8 Central Nervous System  
Retinoid use has been associated with a number of cases of benign intracranial hypertension 
(also known as  pseudotumor cerebri ), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines.  
The cases of benign intracranial hypertension were manifested with sym ptoms and signs such as 
severe headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances , and may be associated with 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_044] .  Headache generally occurs within [ADDRESS_744608] eristics ( eg, severity, location, pattern) to the subject 
should lead to contact[CONTACT_306650] .  In case of such headache, it is at the discretion of the 
Investigator to refer subjects  receiving palovarotene treatment  for neurological and/or 
ophthalm ological examination to rule out benign intracranial hypertension .  Headache will be 
assessed using the standard AE severity scale (see Section 9.1). 
7.3.9 Hearing and Visual Disturbances  
Hearing loss is a common finding in individuals with  FOP.  In Study PVO -1A-001 (NHS) , 42% 
of subjects (48 of 114) reported  hearing loss at baseline.  However, i mpaired hearing also has 
been reported in subjects taking retinoids .  Thus, hearing test s will occur at baseline  (or at

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  Month  6, or the next possible visit,  if they were not obtained at screening)  and at Months 12 and 
24 in Part A , Months  36, and 48  in Part B , and Part A or B EOT/EOS  (excepting Part C) .   
Hearing will be assessed with age -appropriate audiometry behavior testing.  The assessments 
will determine auditory thresholds in response to speech and frequency -specific stimuli 
presented through earphones.  In addition,  The Investigator should refer sub jects receiving 
palovarotene treatment  who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment to specialized care for 
further evaluation .  The subject  with a confirmed diagnosis of hearing impairment (felt to be 
related to the study drug) should be discontinued fro m treatment , based on a benefit -risk 
assessment . 
An ophthalmological examination should be carried out in all subjects receiving palovarotene 
treatment  who are experiencing unexplained visual difficulties.  
Corneal opacities have occurred in subjects receiving retinoids and were reversible upon drug 
discontinuation .  Subjects receiving palovarotene treatment  with corneal opacities should be 
assessed by [CONTACT_4674].  
Decreased night vision has been reported during retinoid therapy .  The onset in some subjects 
can be sudden;  therefore, subjects receiving palovarotene treatment  should be informed and 
warned to be cautious when driving or operating vehicle s at night.

Documented external abnormalities with other retinoids include: skull abnormality; ear 
abnormalities (including anotia, micropi[INVESTIGATOR_24277], small or absent external auditory canals); eye 
abnormalities (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorph ia; and cleft palate .  Documented 
internal abnormalities with other retinoids include: central nervous system  abnormalities 
(including cerebral abnormalities, cerebellar malformation, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial 
nerve deficit); cardiovascular abno rmalities; thymus gland abnormality; and parathyroid 
hormone deficiency .  In some cases , death has occurred with other retinoids with certain of the

standardized procedures detailed in an imaging charter.  
7.4.2 FOP -Physical Function Questionnaire  
On clinic days wh en multiple assessments are to be performed, the age -appropriate FOP -PFQ 
and the age -appropriate PROMIS Global Health Scale should be completed (in that order) by [CONTACT_1560]/parent before any other procedures are completed on those visit days.  
To evaluate  the effect of palovarotene on physical function, age-appropriate forms of the 
FOP-PFQ will be administered  at Screening and every 6 months  in Part A  (Months 6, 12, 18, and 
24), Part B (Months 30, 36, 42, and 48) , and Part A or B EOT/EOS  for each subject . 
The adult form of the FOP -PFQ will be completed by  [CONTACT_1766] 15 years of age and older  (see 
Appendix 2A).  Three Pediatric FOP -PFQ (FOP -PFQ-P) forms will be utilized in  subjects under 
the age of 15  years: a self -completed form developed for 8 - to 14 -year-olds (see Appendix 2B), a 
proxy -completed form developed for 5 - to 14 -year-olds (see  Appendix 2C), and a 
proxy -completed form developed for 2 - to 4-year-olds ( see Appendix 2D). 
Study personnel will be trained on the administration of the instrument s and subjects  (and 
parents of subjects under the age of 15 years) will be provided specific instructions on how to 
complete the instrument  independently .

Pharmacokinetics w ill also be assessed twice  during flare -up dosing : once during the [ADDRESS_744614] 24 months (ie, in Part A) .  Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be 
collected at predose and  3, 6, 10, an d [ADDRESS_744615] -dose.  
The following parameters will be determined where possible by [CONTACT_566929]™: C max,ss, Cmin,ss, Tmax,ss, AUC 0-24ss, λz, t½z, and CL/F.  
The determination of palovarotene plasma concentrations will be performed using a validated 
LC-MS/MS method, and exploration of any relationships with palovarotene exposure will be 
performed.  The time of sample collection as it relates to the time of dosing on the PK days will 
be recorded.  
Detailed instructions for co llection, storage, labeling, and shipment of all samples will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.6 Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_566869]/Study Day 1, a blood sample will be collected and the ACVR1 gene -coding region 
will be sequenced by a central genotyp ing laboratory  to assess for the presence of an 
FOP-associated mutation of the ACVR1 gene for new subjects or for subjects who have not 
undergone previous genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_566854] -1A-001.  Subjects enrolling from Study 
PROTOCOL PVO -1A-301,  AMENDMENT [ADDRESS_744616] does not possess an FOP  
mutation, enrollment may be delayed  until the genotype is confirmed.  
7.7 Data Monitoring Committee  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to  review safety information 
periodically and on an ad hoc basis as outlined in the DMC Charter, which is maintained 
separately from the study  protocol .  The DMC can recommend temporary or permanent stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566870].  The DMC Charter includes 
recommended safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].   The DMC will also review the results of pre -planned 
interim a nalyses (see Section  8.7).  In addition to the Investigator, the DMC will make  
recommendations for potential dose modifications in the event of treatment -related adverse bone 
effects  as described in the Bone Safety M anagement Plan . 
The DMC will include members with relevant clinical expertise, including a good understanding 
of the safety of retinoids.  The methodology and the operating procedures for the safety reviews 
will be developed by [CONTACT_566930].  
7.8 Temporary Measures ( Procedures Related to COVID -19 Pandemic)  
 
Procedures related to COVID -[ADDRESS_744617] of Study PVO -1A-301 (MOVE study) during 
the COVID -[ADDRESS_744618] for differing periods of 
time per country/sit e.  
 
The study visits and assessments to be conducted during this period are listed below:  
Study Visits and Assessments  
1) For subjects aged under 14 years that are still participating in the study but not 
currently receiving palovarotene treatment as per th e global partial clinical hold 
or for any other reason, they will complete Part A or B EOT/EOS and be invited to 
participate in Part C and undergo assessments outlined in Table 3. 
2) For subjects aged [ADDRESS_744619] NOT yet re -started, the following minimum 
assessments  are to be done via remote m onitoring (video conference/phone calls) by 
[CONTACT_737] (or delegated study staff):  
PROTOCOL PVO -1A-301,  AMENDMENT 5 PAGE 67 OF 151 
CLEMENTIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC. 30 OCTOBER  2020  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  a. Chronic visits every 3 -6 months (per protocol): assess for childbearing status 
(females only) and pregnancy prevention measures, CAJIS, ConMeds, 
adverse events, revie w subject diary, PROMIS Global Health Scale*, FOP -
PFQ* (*assessments that can occur remotely but are not required as these are 
not essential to ensure subjects’ safety) .  
b. For females of childbearing status: if pregnancy testing did not continue 
monthly per  protocol post the study medication interruption then at a 
minimum a self -administered urine pregnancy test is to be done within [ADDRESS_744620] laboratory assessments (hematology, biochemistry, 
urinalysis) within [ADDRESS_744621] 90% skeletal maturity radiograph assessments should continue per 
protocol either on site or remotely . 
 
 
Site staff will also assess the subject’s ability to restart remotely.  
3) For subjects 14 years and over that plan to reinitiate dosing, once dosing is 
reinitiated following the required approvals for restart (Ethics Committee and 
Competent Authority), the following minimum assessments  that cannot be 
performed via remote monitoring must be performed either at the clinical site, at the 
subject’s home (by [CONTACT_566931]) or at a local medical facility in order for the 
Investigator to adequately monitor the sa fety of subjects:  
a. Via remote monitoring (telephone or video conferencing) by [CONTACT_10670] (or 
delegated study staff):  
i. Chronic visits (per protocol schedule every 3 and/or 6 months): C -
SSRS, assess for childbearing status (females only) and pregnancy 
preve ntion measures, CAJIS, ConMeds, adverse events, PROMIS 
Global Health Scale*, FOP PFQ* (*assessments that can occur 
remotely but are not required as these are not essential to ensure 
subjects’ safety), study drug dispensing  
ii. Flare up visits (per protocol sc hedule): C -SSRS, ConMeds, adverse 
events, study drug dispensing  
b. Via home visit by [CONTACT_566931]/local assessment  
i. Chronic visits per protocol schedule (every 3 and/or every 6 months): 
body weight, vital signs, hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, self -
administered pregnancy test (monthly), ConMeds, adverse events, 
review subject diary  
ii. Flare up visits (per protocol schedule): vital signs, body weight, 
hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, self -administered pregnancy 
testing, ConMeds, adverse events, rev iew subject diary  
4) Based on the known safety profile of palovarotene to date in FOP patients, the 
following assessments can be postponed as determined by [CONTACT_566932], as they do not constitute assessments where a safety 
PROTOCOL PVO -1A-301,  AMENDMENT [ADDRESS_744622] has not indicated a safety concern of 
avascular necrosis of the hip. Any concerns for avascular necrosis of the hip 
based on clinical assessment should be followed up;  
b. For subjects who have reached at least 90% skeletal maturity radiograph 
assessments may be postponed given the low risk of early growth plate 
closure as well as growth plate abnormalities;  
c. Linear height and kn ee height (Subjects [ADDRESS_744623] 90%);  
d. ECG (FOP patients can have ECG abnormalities, ECG changes noted in 
subjects on Palovarotene were similar to those seen in the untreated sub jects 
in the Natural History Study. Clinical concerns of abnormal ECG findings 
should continue to be followed);  
e. Hearing evaluation (As a class, retinoids can cause abnormal hearing. 
Evaluation should be performed if there is clinical concern);  
f. Physical e xam (Palovarotene has been shown to cause retinoid skin reactions 
which can be assessed remotely);  
 
Individual subjects may require assessments if there is a clinical concern as identified 
by [CONTACT_737]. Protocol deviations that have an impact on su bject safety should 
be notified immediately to CRO/Sponsor as it may necessitate an urgent safety 
measure notification to competent authorities and ethics committees in some 
countries.   
5) End of Treatment/End of Study Assessments:  
a. The following assessments should be performed via remote monitoring 
(telephone or video conferencing) by [CONTACT_10670] (or delegated study staff):  
i. C-SSRS, assess for childbearing status (females only) and pregnan cy 
prevention measures, CAJIS, Con -Meds, adverse events, PROMIS 
Global Health Scale, FOP PFQ  
b. The following assessments should be performed at the subject’s home (by 
[CONTACT_566931]) or at a local medical facility: Body weight, vital signs, 
hematology, bio chemistry, urinalysis, pregnancy test (monthly), ConMeds, 
adverse events, review subject diary  
6) Once on -site visits resume, the following assessments should be performed on 
site as well as any assessment that was not obtained via remote monitoring or 
Symphony nurse:   
a. X-rays, Whole -Body CT, Linear and Knee Height, Physical Exam, Hearing 
Test, ECG.  
7) Informed Consent/Subject Communication: In consultation with their site IRB/EC, 
Investigators are required to inform subjects of the temporary changes (durin g the 
COVID -19 global pandemic) to the study conduct and monitoring plans that could 
impact them and their willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The method 
of communication to subjects (e.g., email, phone call, information letter) and 
docume ntation of subject/caregiver acknowledgement is to be performed and

The primary efficacy analysis comparing the annualized change in new HO volume between 
subjects treated with palovarotene and untreated subjects has an overall probability of study 
success of 0.92 if palovarotene treatment reduces the number of regions wit h new HO by 30% 
and reduces the new HO volume conditional on new HO in a per body region by 50 %.  With this 
treatment effect, the probability of declaring study success is 0.51, 0.79, and 0.[ADDRESS_744630] who has signed the informed consent form.  
Screened subjects who complete screening and met all eligibility criteria will be eligible for 
palovarotene treatment.   
8.4 Analysis  Populations  
In Part A , the MOVE subjects will be grouped into the following populations for analysis : 
• The Principal Enrolled Population  (Principal EP) includes all subjects with the R206H 
ACVR1 mutation who have not previously been treated with palovarotene  and who sign 
the informed consent form and meet all eligibility criteria of the MOVE Trial . 
• The Principal Full Analysis Set ( Principal FAS) includes all enrolled subjects in the 
Principal EP who have  a baseline HO volume measurement and at least one post -baseline 
HO volume measurement in the MOVE trial.  For efficacy comparisons to the NHS, the 
Principal FAS will also include subjects enrolled in the NHS with available baseline and 
at least one post -baseline HO volume measurements.  
• The Principal Per-Protocol Set (Principal PPS) is a subset of the Principal FAS including 
subjects with no  major protocol deviations that are expected to interfere with assessments 
of the primary endpoint , and with at least 80% compliance to the study drug regimen , 
over the first [ADDRESS_744631] -baseline HO volume measurements and with no major protocol 
deviation s over 24  months  that are expected to interfere with assessments of the primary 
endpoint.  
• The Principal Safety Set ( Principal SS): includes all enrolled subjects receiving at least 
one dose of palovarotene in the current study.  For safety comparisons to the NHS, t he 
Principal SS will also include subjects enrolled in the NHS with available post -baseline 
follow -up.  
• The Principal Pharmacokinetic Set ( Principal PS) includes all enrolled subjects receiving 
at least one dose of palovarotene and providing evaluable phar macokinetics data in the 
current study.  
Subjects who do not have the R206H ACVR1 mutation or who have received previous treatment 
with palovarotene will comprise the Supplementary E P, the Supplementary FAS, the 
Supplementary PPS, the Supplementary SS, and the Supplementary PS, with these populations 
defined analogously as above for the subjects with the R206H ACVR1 mutation.  
8.5 Statistical Methods  
8.5.1 Extent of Exposure  
The extent of study treatment will be assessed , and summary statistics will be presented for the 
SS population s. 
8.5.2 Analyses  of Efficacy Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy  Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the annualized change in new HO volume (as assessed by [CONTACT_6398]-
dose WBCT)  over [ADDRESS_744632] scan 𝑗 with duration 𝑤𝑖𝑗 (the time between 
scan 𝑗 and the previous scan) is distributed as  
𝐾𝑖𝑗~𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠 (𝜆𝑖∗𝑤𝑖𝑗∗𝜃1,𝑡(𝑖𝑗)). 
The subject -level rate 𝜆𝑖 follows a gamma distribution and 𝑡(𝑖𝑗) is an indicator function equal to 
[ADDRESS_744633] was not 
on treatment.  Letting 𝜃1,0=1, the variable 𝜃1,[ADDRESS_744634] i in scan j is assumed to be distributed as  
PROTOCOL PVO -1A-301,  AMENDMENT 5 PAGE 72 OF 151 
CLEMENTIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC. 30 OCTOBER  2020  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  𝑍𝑖𝑗𝑟~𝑁(𝛼∗𝛼𝑟∗𝜃2,𝑡(𝑖𝑗),𝛼𝑟2
𝜏𝑡(𝑖𝑗)). 
Letting 𝜃2,0=1, the vari able 𝜃2,[ADDRESS_744635] on new HO volume conditional on 
new HO occurring, 𝜃2,1,  expressed as 𝛾=𝜃1,1∗𝜃2,1.  Random samples generated via Gibb s 
sampling from the posterior distribution of 𝜃1,1 and 𝜃2,1 will be used to compute the posterior 
probability that 𝛾<[ADDRESS_744636] (w LME) analysis with and without the 
square -root transformation will also be performed.  
Approximately [ADDRESS_744637] interim analysis will 
occur when 35 subjects complete 1  year of follow -up; the sec ond and third interim analyses will 
occur when all subjects enrolled in the Principal EP have complete d (ie, have WBCT data) 
[ADDRESS_744638] interim.  The amount of statistical informatio n at each interim analysis can 
be approximated by [CONTACT_566933] -up in each study divided by [CONTACT_566934].  The 
total follow -up expected across the NHS and the MOVE Trial is 317.5 years (NHS: 45 ∗1.5 years 
+ 45 ∗2.0 years; MOVE:  80∗2.0 years).  Assuming eight subjects enrolled in the MOVE study 
per month, the percentage of patient follow -up for each analysis is 66%, 80% , and 92% at the 
first, second , and third interim analysis, respectively.  Using these percentages, the alpha level 
threshold use d to determine treatment effect significance at each analysis was derived using the 
Lan-DeMets alpha -spending function with O’Brien -Fleming parameterization and assuming a 
one-sided, overall type I error rate of 2.5%.  The one -sided significance thresholds  are 0.0058, 
0.0103, 0.0156, and 0.[ADDRESS_744639] not been met by [CONTACT_566935] A the study ma y be terminated .  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_566871] 𝛾<0.7 (at least a 30% reduction in annualized new HO volume on the 
square -root scale) is less than 5 %. and taki ng into consideration additional analys es performed 
without the square -root transformation . 
The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated using the Principal PPS.  Further details regarding 
primary analysis and the planned sensitivity analyses are provide d in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be summarized for the Supplementary FAS and PPS.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy  Analysis  
The secondary efficacy endpoint s will be analyzed using the Principal FAS and PPS populations.  
Treatment e ffect estimates will be generated  for Part A,  and overall  for data obtained in Parts A 
and B . 
The proportion of subjects with any new HO and the change in the number of body regions with 
any new HO will be analyzed using the Bayesian compound Poisson distr ibution used for the 
primary efficacy analysis.  The variables in that model can be used to construct the hypothesis 
test for both of these secondary efficacy endpoints.  
The proportion of subjects with any flare -ups and the flare -up rate per subject -month exposure 
will be analyzed using a Bayesian Poisson distribution .     
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized for the Supplementary FAS and PPS.  
8.5.3 Safety  
Safety evaluations will include AE and SAE reporting, ECGs, vital signs (temperature, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and heart rate), physical examination, body weight and height, 
laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), urine p regnancy tests for 
FOCBP, and concomitant medication reporting.   Safety analyses will use the Principal SS, and 
separately, the Supplementary SS .  Safety will be summarized for Part A and overall for data 
obtained in Parts A , B and C . Where appropriate, co mparisons to safety information from the 
NHS will be made.  
Safety evaluations will include AE and SAE reporting, vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
blood pressure, and heart rate), physical examination, body weight and height,  and concomitant 
medi cation reporting . Safety will be summarized for Part C.   
Evaluation of subjects under the age of 18 enrolled with open epi[INVESTIGATOR_566872] (AP view) and hand -wrist  radiographs (PA view) for assessment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_566873], WBCT scans for growth plate assessments of the bilateral 
hand -wrist  and knee, tibial and femoral long bone lengths, and stadiometry and knee height (in 
PROTOCOL PVO -1A-301,  AMENDMENT 5 PAGE 74 OF 151 
CLEMENTIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC. 30 OCTOBER  2020  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  triplicate) for assessment of linear growth. Safety will be summarized for Part A and overall for 
data obtained in Parts A , B and C  In addition, bilateral assessments of hip growth plate 
morphology for AVN will be performed in all subjects.   
All safety data collected and captured in the eCRF will be included in data listings sorted by 
[CONTACT_121982], subject and time point, or as appropriate.  Mean changes from pre -treatment to on 
treatment will generally be tabulated by [CONTACT_990] -specified time points, while the number of 
subjects with potentially clinically significant values at pre -treatment and at each endpoint will 
be presented.  The last non -missing baseline value will be used as the pre -treatment value for that 
parameter.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be classified using the MedDRA coding  dictionary .  Adverse event severity 
will be as sessed and reported according to criteria defined in the protocol (mild, moderate, 
severe).  
Adverse events known to be associated with retinoids (eg, mucocutaneous events) will be further 
graded according to CTCAE, Version 4.03, 14June2010.  
Tabulations wil l include an overall incidence of at least one AE, incidence within body system, 
and incidence by [CONTACT_11702]  (including by  [CONTACT_11762]) .  Each 
subject may only contribute once (ie, first occurrence) to each of the incidence rates, regardless 
of the number of occurrences.  Incidences (denominators and percentages) for selected gender -
specific AEs will be adjusted by [CONTACT_566936], as appropriate.  
8.5.4 Suicide Ideation  
The number of subjects who report any type 4 or 5 suicide ideations in the C -SSRS or any 
suicide behavior during the study will be presented in listings (see Appendix 5A and  
Appendix 5B). 
8.5.[ADDRESS_744640] values prior to initiation 
of chronic dosing . 
Group -mean plots (mean and standard error) over time will be provided.  
The number and percent age of subjects  with potentially clinically significant (PCS) va lues will 
be summarized .  A focus will be on new -onset PCS values, ie, subjects with pre -existing PCS 
values at pre-treatment will not be considered to have new -onset values on -treatment.

CLEMENTIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC. 30 OCTOBER  2020  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event or Adverse Drug Reaction  
An SAE  (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that  results in any of the 
following outcomes and at any dose:  
• Death . 
• Life threatening situation (the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event) .  It 
does not refer to the hypothetic al risk of death if the AE was more severe or was to 
progress . 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect (any structural abnormality in subject  offspring that 
occurs after intrauterine exposure to treatment) . 
• Other medically important event (important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a n SAE  when, based 
upon medical judgmen t, they may jeopardize the subject  or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above .  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
9.1.3 Adverse Event Documentation  
Advers e event or SAE  reports will be completed for all AEs.  Signs and symptoms of each AE 
should be described in det ail: nature, date of onset, end date, severity, relationship to study drug, 
and action taken and outcome.  
9.1.4 Severity of Adverse Events  
The term severity is used to describe the intensity of a specific event.  
The severity of AEs will be categorized as follows:  
• Mild: events that are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal daily activity.  
• Moderate: events that cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with daily activity and/or 
require a simple dose medication.  
• Severe: events that incapacitate and prevent usual activity or require  systemic drug 
therapy or other trea tment . 
Adverse events known to be associated with retinoids (eg, mucocutaneous) will be further graded 
according to CTCAE, Version 4.03, 14  June 2010.  Sites will be prov ided with specific criteria 
for the coding of AEs.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.5 Causality Assessment  
Causality assessment by [CONTACT_566937].  To promote consistency between the Investigators, the follow ing 
definitions should be taken into consideration along with good clinical and scientific judgment 
when determining the relationship of study drug to an AE: 
• Definitely Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausi ble time relationship to the study drug administration, and which cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153] .  The response to withdrawal 
of the study drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible.  
• Probable: A clinical event,  including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible 
time relationship to the study drug administration, and which is unlikely to be explained 
by [CONTACT_9153] .  The response to withdrawal of the 
study drug  (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible.  
• Possible: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the study drug, but which could also be explained by 
[CONTACT_566938].  Information on the study drug 
withdrawal (dechallenge) may be lacking or unclear.  
• Not related: A clinical event that has no temporal relationship to the study drug or has a 
much more likely alternative etiology.  
9.1.6 Action Taken With Study Drug  
The action taken to remedy the  reported/observed AE s will be defined as follows:  
• None  
• Study d rug dosage  modified  
• Study drug dosage interrupted  
• Study d rug permanently  discontinued  
9.1.7 Outcome of Adverse Event  
The outcome of the AE s will be recorded as follows:  
• Even t resolved with no sequelae  
• Event resolved with sequelae  
• Event ongoing  
• Death

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  Appendix 4.  Methods of Birth Control  
Highly effective methods of birth control:  
• Established use of oral, transdermal, or intravaginal combined (estrogen and progesterone 
containing) hormonal method of contraception.  
• Established use of oral (excluding mini -progesterone -only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), injectable, or implantable 
progesterone -only hormonal contraception.  
• Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  
• Male sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation  of the absence of 
sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner 
should be the sole partner for that subject.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
Note that two hormonal forms cannot be used together.  
Other effective metho ds of birth control include the following:  
• Barrier forms (always used with spermicide) – diaphragm, cervical cap  
• Barrier forms (used with or without spermicide) – male latex condom  
• Others – vaginal sponge (contains spermicide)  
The following are unacceptable forms of birth control:  
• Progestin only “mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]” 
• Female condom  
• Natural family planning (periodic abstinence, such as calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods; rhythm method; or breastfeeding) or withdrawal

SUICID AL BEHAVIOR 
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types) Since Last 
Visit 
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to  be any injur y or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have yo u made a suicide attempt? 
Have yo u done anything to harm yourself?  
Have yo u done anythin g dangerous where you could have died? 
Wha t did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?

Interrupt ed Attempt:   
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred). 
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around

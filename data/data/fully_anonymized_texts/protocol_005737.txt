Protocol v 7_02/11/22    Full Protocol: Power Training Combined with Interval Treadmill Training (PT3) to Improve Walking Activity in 
Cerebral Palsy  
 
Purpose  
The primary purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_726348]  (PT3)  on the primary outcomes of walking performance and capacity in children with CP with 
functional walking limitations. To identify key muscular mechanisms associated with improved walking mobility, 
we will examine the effects of training on muscle performan ce and architecture.  
 
Rationale   
Walking ability significantly deteriorates in 50% of ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) beginning in 
childhood/adolescence. Of those who stop walking, 75% will lose the ability to walk before the age of 25, 
severely impacting their ability to participate in daily life. Although CP is a non -progressive neurological 
disorder, the sequela of musculoskeletal impairments is progressive. Strength training is routinely employed in 
clinical practice to counteract muscle weakness but has not been shown to improve gait speed or other 
measures of walking capacity. One hypothesis for the lack of improvements in ambulation is the focus of 
resistance training programs solely on  improving muscle strength. Our prior work has documented that muscle 
power (product of force and velocity) is reduced by 82% as opposed to a 50% decrement in muscle strength. 
Muscle power is required for functional activities, such as walking, climbing st airs, and transfers, where force 
needs to be generated quickly in order to accomplish the intended goal. To test the hypothesis that muscle 
power is a key limiting factor, rather than strength, we previously conducted a randomized clinical trial 
comparing velocity training (a type of power training) to traditional strength training (Moreau, 2013). Only the 
velocity training intervention significantly improved gait speed and other measures of functional walking 
capacity. These improvements were accompanied b y increased muscle power and the architectural alterations 
of increased fascicle length and muscle cross -sectional area. For this proposal, we hypothesize that in order to 
optimize ambulatory function, it is also essential to practice the task of walking, known as task -specific training. 
Normal walking activity in children and adolescents consist of short intervals of high step rate activity 
interspersed with varying intervals of low and moderate step rates. Children with CP are not able to achieve 
these mo derate and high step rates, presumably due to the lack of muscle power generation. Therefore, it is 
critical that the two approaches be combined in a package of care and that the treadmill training is interval -
based in order to approximate walking patterns  that are developmentally appropriate and thus, stimulate 
muscle power generation during walking.  
 
Specific Aims  
 
Aim #1.   Determine the immediate and retention effects of power training combined with interval 
treadmill training (PT3) on functional walking capacity in ambulatory children with CP.   
We hypothesize that a combined impairment and task -specific approach, which targets muscle power deficits 
specifically , will have a significant effect on functional walking capacity as compared to an equivalent dosage of 
traditional impairment -based and task -specific approaches . In a randomized clinical trial, 48 ambulatory 
participants with CP (10 to 17yrs) will receive either PT3 or an equivalent dosage of traditional strength training 
combined with traditional treadmill training (comparison group) for [ADDRESS_991910] and Timed -up-and-Go. 
 
Aim #2. Quantify the effects of treatment on in vivo  muscle architecture and muscle performance.  
We hypothesize that lower extremity muscle power generation is impaired and is responsible for limitations in 
walking activity, and that PT3 will result in significant improvements in muscle power that will be explained 
partly by [CONTACT_726375] -sectional area and fascicle length. Muscle architecture will be measured with 
ultrasound imaging, and muscle performance outcomes will be measured with isokinetic dynamometry.  
 
 
 
Aim #3. To directly capture the effect of treatment on community -based walking activity and 
participation, we will use a novel combination of global position system (GPS) and accelerometry.  
Protocol v 7_02/11/22    For this exploratory aim , we hypothesize that improved walking capacity from PT3 will enhance community -
walking activity and participation captured in real -world settings. We will use coordinate data from GPS devices 
synchronized with StepWatch accelerometers to directly measure strides per day, stride rates, distance, 
duration, and location.  This novel technology will allow us to better characterize walking activity outside of the 
clinic/laboratory setting and has far -reaching clinical implications.  
 
Significance  and Background  
 
Gait impairments and deterioration in ambulatory children with Cerebral Palsy (CP)  
   Cerebral palsy (CP) is a nonprogressive developmental disorder of movement and posture that leads to 
activity limitation caused by [CONTACT_726376], during, or shortly after birth (Rosenbaum, 
2007). CP occurs in 3.6 per 1,000 live births  or 1 in 278 children, according to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) and is the most common physical disability originating in childhood. The CDC reports 
the incidence of CP is higher than childhood cancer, hearing and vision loss, s pi[INVESTIGATOR_113163], hemophilia, fetal 
alcohol syndrome, and cystic fibrosis (Yeargin -Allsopp, 2008).  
   Although the initial brain insult is nonprogressive, CP is a lifelong disorder due to secondary musculoskeletal 
problems and associated activity limitations that progress into adulthood. Gait disturbances are an activity 
limitation that is a hallmark ch aracteristic of CP. The progressive deterioration of walking ability begins in early 
adolescence and is a serious health concern. Deterioration in walking occurs in 50% of ambulatory children 
with CP (Jahnsen, 2004; Opheim, 2009). Of those who stop walking , 75% report walking cessation before the 
age of 25 while 50% report cessation before 15 years of age (Andersson & Mattsson, 2001; Murphy, 1995).  
Gait speed must be adequate in order for children with CP to keep up with their peers, participate in social 
activities, and lessen the deterioration of walking ability. Loss of independence associated with gait 
deterioration can lead to lower quality of life, including decreased participation in the community. Therefore, It 
is imperative that interventions to im prove gait speed and walking ability be implemented prior to the 
deterioration of walking ability. Throughout the proposal, we will use the term “ambulatory children with CP” to 
refer to children who are categorized in Gross Motor Function Classification S ystem (GMFCS) levels I, II, and 
III (Rosenbaum, 2008). These children are able to either walk independently (level I), independently but require 
handrails to climb stairs (level II), or with an assistive device (level III), such as a walker or crutches.  
Task -specific training alone for improving walking is not sufficient  
   Task -specificity refers to repetitive training that specifically targets the task that one is trying to rehabilitate or 
improve and is based on motor learning and motor control principles related to use -dependent plasticity  
(Schmidt & Lee, 2011; Nudo, 2003). For example, treadmill training with and without body weight support has 
been advocated in order to practice the task of walking while maximizing the number of steps taken per 
session when compared to overground walking (Dobkin, 1999). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_3404] f act that task -specificity is 
considered to be one of the key ingredients for effective rehabilitative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], task -specific training alone has 
not been shown to be superior to other physical therapy interventions for improving walking. This finding is 
consistent across multiple populations, including CP, stroke, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (Damiano & DeJong, 2009; 
Duncan, 2011; Charalambous, 2013; Mehrholz, 2012; Mehrholz, 2014). The limitation of task -specific training 
for individuals with CP is the reduced capability of performing repeated practice of a task due to underlying 
neuromuscular deficits. Furthermore, the implementation of assistive devices, such as treadmill training with 
body weight support or robotic training, to make it “easier” to practice wa lking decreases muscle activation (van 
Hedel, 2006), which only further exacerbate the underlying neuromuscular deficits.  
Strength training is not effective in improving walking in ambulatory children with CP  
   Because muscle strength has been shown to be highly correlated with gait speed and walking ability and is a 
significant impairment in children with CP (Damiano & Abel, 1998; Ross & Engsberg, 2007), strength training is 
a routinely administered intervention  that is considered to be a component of standard of care for children with 
CP. However, results of 2 systematic literature reviews (Scianni, 2009; Moreau 2016), including recent 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (Scholtes, 2012; Taylor, 2013), confir m that despi[INVESTIGATOR_726349], strength training is not effective in improving gait speed or other measures of walking ability in 
CP. A meta -analysis conducted by [CONTACT_726377] a negligible effect of strength training  on 
gait speed with an overall standardized effect size of 0.06 (p=0.51) (Moreau, 2016).  
Power training is effective in improving walking in ambulatory children with CP  
   Muscle weakness has been considered one of the primary impairments contributing to activity limitations in 
children with CP. However, other aspects of muscle performance, such as muscle power and rate of force  
Protocol v 7_02/11/22    development (RFD) have received far less attention, yet are 
important for the performance of functional activities. Whereas 
strength refers to the maximum amount of force or torque that a 
muscle can generate, muscle power refers to the ability to 
generate the greatest amount of force as fast as possible and is 
the product of force and the velocity at which the force is 
produced. Strength is only concerned with maximal force or 
torque, whereas power involves both strength and the velocity of 
the movement. RFD refers to the rate at  which force is developed 
but is distinctly different from muscle power in that it can only be 
calculated during maximum isometric contractions whereas power 
can be calculated during dynamic movements. These distinctions 
are important because most daily ac tivities, such as transfers, 
walking, and moving from a sitting to a standing position, do not 
require maximal muscle strength to complete the task. Rather, 
these activities require force to be generated quickly in order to accomplish the intended goal. Al though lower 
extremity muscle weakness is pervasive in CP and has been reported to be decreased by [CONTACT_45848] 40% to 
60%  (Wiley & Damiano, 1998; Ross & Engsberg, 2002), we have documented that RFD and muscle power 
are more significantly impaired than musc le strength. We measured muscle power, RFD, and muscle strength 
in cohorts of ambulatory children with CP compared to an age -matched typi[INVESTIGATOR_241830] (TD) cohort. On 
average, peak torque, as a measure of strength, was decreased by 36% to 50%, whereas R FD and muscle 
power were decreased by 70% and 82%, respectively, compared to TD children (Moreau, 2012; Moreau, 
2013) (Figure 1). Furthermore, lower muscle power was strongly associated with walking limitations. Our work 
demonstrates the importance of musc le power for walking as well as the performance of functional activities.  
  
To examine the influence of muscle power on walking speed and functional mobility, [CONTACT_290714] conducted an 
RCT to compare the effects of high -velocity training (a type of power training) versus traditional strength 
training of the quadriceps on muscle arch itecture and performance, walking speed, and functional walking 
mobility (Moreau, 2013). This trial was conducted in ambulatory children with CP (GMFCS I -III), ages 10 to 18. 
After 8 weeks of training (24 sessions), only children undergoing high -velocity t raining improved their peak 
power production, increased their gait speed, and distance ambulated. Participants who underwent strength 
training (low velocity) did not improve gait speed or distance. In addition, this study was the first to document 
differen tial muscle architectural adaptations in CP between the two types of training, thus illustrating that 
muscles in CP are highly plastic and are capable of responding to specificity of training stimuli. Although cross 
sectional area (determinant of force pro duction) increased significantly after both strength and high -velocity 
training, rectus femoris fascicle (fiber) length, which is the primary architectural determinant of muscle 
shortening velocity, significantly increased after high -velocity training but decreased after strength training 
(p=.012). This work provides direct support for the hypothesis that deficiencies in muscle power are 
responsible for walking limitations in CP and can be remediated to produce clinically significant improvements 
in walking  speed and functional walking ability. Furthermore, increases in muscle power can be explained in 
part by [CONTACT_726378]. This is a central component of power train ing that distinguishes it from strength training. Therefore, 
the underlying premise for this study is that deficits in lower extremity muscle power generation are a key 
limiting factor for walking in children with CP. Thus, remediating muscle power deficit s will lead to improved 
walking abilities as evidenced by [CONTACT_726379]. Building on this prior work, we postulate that in order to 
maximize ambulation potential, participants must also practice the task of walking in order to learn how to use 
muscle powe r generation during the task of walking. We hypothesize that this combined impairment -based 
(power training) and task -specific (treadmill training) approach (PT3) will provide the optimal stimulus to 
increase walking activity and participation.  
 
Treadmill training should be developmentally appropriate and reflect children’s activity patterns rather 
than adult patterns  
   TD children and adolescents demonstrate physical activity patterns that are markedly different from adults. 
TD children engage in periods of intense bursts of physical activity (10 -15 seconds) followed by [CONTACT_726380], representing similar  patterns to interval training (Armstrong, 1990; Bailey, 1995; Bjornson, 
2007). In contrast, adults typi[INVESTIGATOR_726350] -state activity of a low to moderate intensity (Tudor -Locke,

torque)(Nm) and power (watts) in CP are 64%

Protocol v 7_02/11/22    2012). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], treadmill training protocols for children with CP have been developed from adult protocols, 
which are time or endurance -based, and therefore, are not appropriate for children and adolescents.  
   Gait speed and stride rate (strides/min) are common temporal -spatial parameters of walking intensity 
(Barreira, 2012). [CONTACT_434056] reported day -to-day walking activity using stride rate monitors (Bjornson, 2010; 
Bjornson, 2014). Activity patterns for c hildren with CP do not approximate the same intensity levels as those of 
TD children. Children with CP spend the majority of their time ambulating at low intensity levels (low stride 
rates < 30 strides/min) and have difficulty rampi[INVESTIGATOR_726351] (30 -60 strides/min) and high stride rates (> 60 
strides/min) (Bjornson, 2014). In addition, children with CP walked less with a significantly lower number of 
overall strides per day than TD youth. Therefore, we propose that treadmill training should be development ally 
appropriate, reflecting the walking patterns of children rather than adults. We will address these walking 
limitations with “interval” treadmill training. Our interval treadmill training protocol consists of short bursts of fast 
walking (i.e, higher s trides/min) alternating with lower to moderate intensity (i.e., lower to medium stride rates) 
in order to mimic age -specific walking activity that is developmentally appropriate. We also hypothesize that 
the inability of children with CP to ramp up to high er stride rates is due to deficits in muscle power generation. 
Therefore, PT3 will remediate muscle power deficits and provide the underlying muscular resources and task -
specific training necessary to achieve moderate and high stride rates during walking.  
Community -based as well as clinic -based outcome measures of walking activity and participation  
   According to the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health 
(ICF), activity is defined as the execution of a task by [CONTACT_726381] a life si tuation. Activity and participation can be examined by [CONTACT_726382] - and performance -
based measures. Walking capacity is typi[INVESTIGATOR_726352]. Walking performance, on the other hand, r epresents what a person actually performs in 
everyday life (World Health Organization, 2001). Although it is important to use valid, reliable, and 
standardized outcome measurements of walking capacity, such as gait speed, these outcome measures must 
be sup plemented in order to determine overall effectiveness of an intervention, which refers to walking 
performance under real -world conditions. Bjornson et al. (2013) reported that daily walking performance 
measured with the accelerometry is positively correlat ed with participation in mobility -based life habits. 
Specifically, in persons with CP, reduced participation in daily activities appears related to the inability to 
achieve high stride rates. The proposed study will measure outcomes of both walking capacit y in the clinical 
setting as well as walking performance out in community settings using accelerometry paired with global 
position system (GPS) monitoring. The StepWatch accelerometer precisely measures average strides per day 
and stride rate; however, suc h measures lack information on the location of walking. Linking StepWatch data 
with GPS allows measurement and characterization of the actual locations where walking activity occurs. This 
novel combination of measurement technology provides a method for as sessing changes in performance and 
participation in real -world settings.  
 
Preliminary Studies  
Comparison of Power Training to Interval Treadmill Training  
   Preliminary data from our research team’s current R21 (HD077186) investigating the effects of interval 
treadmill training in ambulatory children with CP (n = 10) showed moderate changes from pre to post -training 
in self -selected and fast gait speed of 0.05 m/s and 0.09m/s, respectively, after [ADDRESS_991911] investigating high -velocity or power training in ambulatory children with CP 
(Section A.4) demonstrated greater changes in self -selected and fast gait speed of 0.1 0m/s and 0.12m/s, 
respectively, after 24 sessions of training (p<0.05) (Moreau, 2013) . These improvements met or exceeded the 
minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.10m/s reported for gait speed in CP (Oeffinger, 2008).  
Combined Power Training and Interval Treadmill Training (PT3)  
   We hypothesize that combining the two approaches (PT3) will provide the optimal stimulus to improve 
walking and will lead to significant gains in the primary outcome of gait speed. The PI’s published power 
training program (Moreau, 2013) (i.e., high -veloci ty training) was conducted on an isokinetic dynamometer, 
which is an expensive, specialized pi[INVESTIGATOR_726353]. This protocol 
targeted the quadriceps muscle group specifically. Peak torque of the quadriceps has been shown to be highly 
correlated to gait speed and improved kinematics in CP (Damiano, 1995; Damiano, 2001; Moreau, 2012).  
To date, Moreau (2013) is the only power training study in CP to report statistically and clinically significant 
improvements in gait speed and muscle power and targeted the quadriceps. It is also the only RCT to directly 
compare power training to strength  training in CP in a controlled manner that isolated the dosing ingredients 
that distinguish power training from strengthening, i.e. velocity of movement and load. The power training 
Protocol v 7_02/11/22    protocol proposed in PT3 advances the prior protocol (Moreau, 2013) by 1) targeting the quadriceps primarily 
in addition to other muscle groups that are important for gait, including the hip extensors and ankle 
plantarflexors; 2) using a closed kinetic cha in exercise (i.e., single and bilateral leg press), which is considered 
to be more functional and minimizes hamstring recruitment, while adhering to same dosing guidelines; and 3) 
using clinically feasible, less -costly equipment in order to provide easier translation to clinical practice.  
   PT3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]:  PT3 was conducted in hourly sessions 3 x per week for 8 weeks (24 sessions total). (See 
Approach for detailed protocol.) Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_726354]3 documented a mean increase of 0.16m/s and 0.17m/s in 
self-selected and fast gait speed, respectively, after [ADDRESS_991912] size that 
exceeds the MCID of 0.10m/s. Distance ambulated as measured by [CONTACT_941] 1MWT increased on average by 9.[ADDRESS_991913] size that exceeds the average MCID of 7.8 meter s (Hassani, 2014). These 
gains exceed those from either power/velocity training or interval treadmill training alone. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_726355] a bilateral leg press increased by 52% on 
average a nd was accompanied by a 9% increase in rectus femoris cross -sectional area and a 15% increase in 
fascicle length, as measured by [CONTACT_37056]. Collectively, our published data (power training) and 
preliminary data (interval treadmill training R21 and  PT3) support our hypotheses for Aims 1 and 2 and provide 
evidence of the feasibility of both the testing (outcome measures) and intervention protocols.  
 
PT3 and Walking Activity and Participation in Daily Life  
   Walking limitations in children with CP have been documented to have a negative influence on their level of 
participation in daily life (Fauconnier, 2009; Lepage, 1998). To date, measures of participation have been 
primarily obtained via child and/or paren tal self -report questionnaires. Responsiveness to change and the 
ability to show statistical significance after an intervention has been very limited due to the subjective nature of 
these self -reports. In fact, out of 131 studies included in a systemati c literature review of interventions for 
children with CP, only 5% (n=7) reported outcomes for participation and only 30% for activity (Novak, 2013). In 
this state of the evidence paper, Novak et al. concluded that there are no proven effective interventio ns for 
addressing participation and that research and funding should be dedicated to this important area.  
   Participants in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_726356]3 reported positive changes in participation and quality of life through the 
self-report questionnaires, Activities Scale for Kids performance version (ASKp) and the Patient Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information  System (PROMIS) Pediatric Profile (49 v1.0). For example, 2 participants 
reported average weekly pain scores of 6/10 and 3/10 on the PROMIS that reduced to 0/10 and 1/10, 
respectively, after PT3. The reduction in pain was accompanied by [CONTACT_6270] -reported incr eases in walking activity 
and participation with peers and siblings in everyday life (ASKp). Similarly, at baseline, one participant 
ambulated with a walker at home but used a wheelchair primarily in the community and at school. After 8 
weeks of PT3, he re ported that he ambulated independently without an assistive device at home and 50% of 
the time in the community with a reduction in pain from 6/10 to 0/10, used a walker at school and for long 
distances, and no longer used a wheelchair. Although we were ab le to capture clinically meaningful changes in 
functional walking capacity (> MCID) with our standardized measures of self -selected and fast gait speed, [ADDRESS_991914] (1MWT), and Timed -Up-and-Go (TUG), these measurements were obtained in the clinic an d 
did not necessarily reflect the change in activity and participation experienced in daily life.  
   For Aim 3, we will implement an exploratory novel combination of GPS and walking accelerometry to 
measure the effects of treatment on community -based walking activity and participation captured in day -to-day 
life, thereby [CONTACT_726383] y walking and mobility -based participation using objective data. 
Our research team has pi[INVESTIGATOR_726357] -based walking activity and GPS in 
ambulatory children with CP (GMFCS levels I, II, III) who underwent 20 sessions of inte rval treadmill training, 
which is one of the components of PT3 (R21 unpublished data). Average strides/day increased by 1441 
strides/day post -training. The percentage of strides per day in medium and high stride rates increased post -
training, approximating  levels of TD children. These changes are reflective of walking patterns in TD children 
and adolescents, consisting of bursts of moderate and high step rate activity throughout the day. Figure 2 
displays synchronized GPS and StepWatch data for a child with  CP at GMFCS level I measured over 1 day. 
Synchronized GPS and StepWatch data quantified stride rates (no walking, low, medium, high stride rates) by 
[CONTACT_157478] (soccer field, home or school). For this child, medium stride activity occurred at school and a s occer 
field, with no high stride rate activity documented. Thus, our preliminary data supports Aim 3 by [CONTACT_726384], such as the amount and location of strides and stride rate intensity levels.  
 
Protocol v 7_02/11/22    Methods  
 
Participant Characteristics  
   We will enroll 48 children with bilateral spastic CP 
(spastic diplegia) between the ages of 10 -17 years and 
within GMFCS levels I, II or III (i.e., ambulatory). 
Although children in GMFCS level IV could benefit from 
the intervention and are considered n on-community 
level ambulators, we chose to include only levels I -III in 
order to decrease the heterogeneity of clinical 
presentation. Only children with bilateral spasticity as 
their primary movement disorder will be enrolled due to 
their documented muscle  power limitations and to 
control for heterogeneity. This age range was chosen 
because of the documented deterioration in walking 
ability that begins in adolescence. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_726358]. 
Participants who have undergone orthopedic or 
neurosurgery less than 12 months prior to enrollment, 
injection therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (phenol, botulinum toxin) less than 3 
months prior, or are lacking greater than 25 degree s of 
knee extension will be excluded to remove confounding 
effects.

receive either PT3 or the comparison intervention. We will employ a randomized block design with two blocking 
factors, GMFCS level and study sit e. This will address any clinical heterogeneity of outcome measures by 
[CONTACT_726385]. Outcomes assessors will be blinded to group assignment. The study 
biostatistician, [CONTACT_726402], will generate randomization sequences in accordance wit h the study design.

Protocols and Timeline  
 
Intervention Protocols:  
 
Power Based Approach: Power training combined with interval treadmill training (PT3).   Participants will 
receive 24, 1 -hour sessions of PT3 over 8 weeks (3 x per week with minimum of 48 hours separating treatment 
sessions). Participants will be allowed an additional 2 weeks to make up any missed sessions for a maximum 
of 10 weeks to complete the 24 sessions.  This protocol was based on the National Strength and Conditioning 
Association (NSCA) resistance training guidelines for children and adolescents for power (Faigenbaum, 2009) 
and on prior work. The training session will begin with a [ADDRESS_991918] ing of any of the following 
activities, tailored to each participant: walking at self -selected speed, stationary cycling without resistance, or 
dynamic stretching. Training will consist of unilateral and bilateral leg presses (Total Gym GTS®, San Diego, 
CA), which will primarily target the quadriceps followed by [CONTACT_726389]. The equipment 
allows for partial gravity -elimination that can be tailored to each participant depending on his/her initial level of 
capability. The sled can be positioned from nearly horizontal to approximately a 30 degree incline (Figure 3). 
Weights will be added to a weight bar to increase resistance. Target load will be 40% to 80% of 1 -repetition 
maximum (1RM) with progression towards 80% according to the NSCA  resistance training guidelines for 
muscle power training (Faigenbaum, 2009). Participants will undergo 1RM testing prior to the first intervention 
session in order to determine the initial training load. This session will occur a minimum of [ADDRESS_991919] intervention session. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_726361] 50  
to 60% of 1RM. Actual loads will be determined by [CONTACT_726390]. Following the warm -up, each participant will perform 3 to 5 
submaximal efforts followed by 6 sets of 5 maximum -effort repetitions at the predetermined percentage of 1RM 
for each leg separately. Instructions for the concentric phase of the leg press will be to “push as fast as 
possible” with the eccentric portion performed slow and controlled over 1 -2 second s. Performing the concentric 
phase of movement 
“explosively” or as 
fast as possible is a 
key active dosing 
ingredient for 
power training. 
Following the 
unilateral leg 
presses, 6 sets of 5 
repetitions of 
bilateral leg 
presses will be 
performed at the 
predetermined 
percentage of 1RM.  
Figure 3.  Power training conducted on a leg press (Total Gym GTS ®) in a 12yo subject with CP. The 
concentric portion of the leg press illustrated here is performed “explosively” or as fast as possible.  

Protocol v 7_02/11/[ADDRESS_991920] will be provided 
between power training and treadmill training.  
  The interval treadmill training portion will include short -bursts (30 seconds) of high speed walking intervals 
alternating with [ADDRESS_991921] will walk at a 
comfortable, self -selected speed. Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], starting tread speed for high speed walking will be 75 -
80% of the participant’s overground fast gait speed and low speed walking b outs will begin at 75 -80% of 
overground self -selected gait speed. Treadmill speed will be controlled by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_726362]’s OMNI Scale of Perceived Exertion (Robertson, 2005). Total duration of each session will be [ADDRESS_991922] walking speed during the high speed intervals and to maximize duration (up to 30 minutes) within 
and between sessions over time. Participants will wear a gait belt with contact [CONTACT_726391]. If needed (under discretion of the interventionist ), participants 
will wear a harness connected to an overhead frame support for safety and will be allowed to use handrails as 
needed. The overhead harness will not provide any body weight support; it will only be used for safety. During 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124], we d etermined that the majority of participants preferred the gait belt over the harness. The 
interval treadmill training protocol is currently being tested as part of [CONTACT_290714] and Bjornson’s R21 
(HD077186) and PT3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].  
 
Comparison intervention (Traditional Approaches):  Strength Training Combined with Treadmill Training. During 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_726363]3, each combined power and treadmill training session lasted 60 minutes on average 
(range: 50 to 70 minutes). Therefore, the comparison group will receive an equivalent  dosage of traditional 
treadmill training plus traditional strength training (up to 30 minutes for each component for a total of 1 -hour 
session) delivered 3 times per week over 8 weeks. Participants will be allowed an additional 2 weeks to make 
up any missed sessions for a maximum of 10 weeks to complete the 24 sessions. Warm -up, equipment, and 
procedures for the strength training component will be identical to the power training protocols above except 
for the dosing ingredients that distinguish power training from strength training (load, volume, velocity), which 
are base d on the NSCA resistance training guidelines for children and adolescents (Faigenbaum, 2009): 
Target load will be 60% to 85% of 1RM with progression towards 85%; volume will be 3 sets of 8 -12 
repetitions; both concentric and eccentric motions will be perfo rmed at slow and controlled movement speeds 
over [ADDRESS_991923] of steady -state walking at a constant self -selected speed for 
20 to 30 minutes with rests as needed. The goal will be to increase the duration to 30 minutes. Initial treadmill 
speed will be 75 -80% of overground s elf-selected walking speed and will be adjusted as needed to 
accommodate the participant. Speed will be increased when the subject can walk for [ADDRESS_991924] reaches their maximum walking speed, an incline will be applied to treadmill.  
 
Fidelity of Interventions:  Intervention fidelity across sites will be addressed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -person training of  all 
intervention therapi[INVESTIGATOR_726364]. Moreau employing an intervention visit procedural checklist of visit tasks. 
Intervention therapi[INVESTIGATOR_726365] 100% performance and completion prior to study initiation. Training videos 
and manuals will be provided for r eference. Interventionists will complete checklist for every study visit with 
physical monitoring of intervention visits by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_726366] 1, 4 and 7 for each participant with real -time 
feedback provided. If performance falls <95%, the interventionis t will repeat training.  
 
Testing / Assessment Protocols  
 
Procedures: Outcomes will be assessed pre and post intervention to determine immediate effects of 
treatment; at [ADDRESS_991925] for short -term retention; and [ADDRESS_991926] f or long -term retention (Figure 4 ). The 
goal will be to perform the baseline assessment within [ADDRESS_991927] -assessment, respectively. However, a 2 -week window 
will be allowed for all assessment timepoints.  
Protocol v 7_02/11/22     
 
 
 
  
Outcome  Measures : Assessors will be blinded to group assignment.  
 
1) Clinical Assessment: Anthropometric measurements  (height, weight, leg length, lower leg length, thigh 
length) will be collected. Knee and ankle range -of-motion will be measured. The child will be classified 
according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), levels I, II, or II.  
2) Walking Capacity:  Self-selected and fast walking speeds will be calculated from the [ADDRESS_991928] as the 
average of three trials each (33). The time that it takes to walk a distance of [ADDRESS_991929] (1MWT), in which the distance the child can 
walk as fast as possible in one minute is calculated (34). For the Timed up and Go (TUG) test, the child is 
asked to stand up from a standard chair and walk a distance of approximately 10 feet (measure as 3 
meters), turn around and walk back to the chair and sit down again (46). All measures have been widely 
used in this population in clinical settings and shown to be reliable measures (33 -34, 46).  Participants will 
also be videotaped while walking on the treadmill from the front/back view and a side view. The walking 
videos will be analyzed for quality of gait using the Edinburgh Visual Gait Score.  
3) Community Walking Performance  Activity : The StepWatch (Song, 2006) is a pager sized, 2 -dimensional  
accelerometer. Locational data will be collected for all participants using Qstarz BT -Q1000XT GPS data 
loggers (Taipei, Taiwan), which collects instantaneous latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, distance from 
previous point, and precision estimates at co nfigurable intervals. Participants will wear both devices on the 
lateral side of the ankle inside a knit cloth cuff during all waking hours for 7 days, except  during swimming, 
bathing, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_726367]. Five days will be used for data analysis (4 weekdays and 1 
weekend day) (Bjornson, 2010; 2011). The StepWatch will be configured to aggregate data at the same 
rate as the GPS data (1 -minute epochs). The device data will be synchroni zed and joined using 
timestamps recorded by [CONTACT_541575].  Raw data recorded from the StepWatch will be downloaded to a 
computer. Average walking strides taken per day, percent time walking, and strides at low, moderat e and 
high stride rates will be calculated from the raw StepWatch data as described in more detail by [CONTACT_726392]. in children with cerebral palsy (3, 17).  Walking activity measures from the StepWatch synchronized and 
coupled with the XY coordinate data from the GPS will allow quantification of the location, duration and 
distance of walking activity (Kang, 2013). Walking activity occurring outside a 20 meter  buffer zone 
surrounding the geocoded home address will be classified as community -based while wal king activity 
occurring within the 20 meter buffer will be considered to occur in the home.  
4) Muscle architecture: The ultrasound imaging methods used in this study have been previously published in 
children with CP by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Moreau (Moreau, 2009b). Briefly, images will be obtained at mid -thigh and lower 
leg using B -mode ultrasound imaging (GE Logiq e) with a variable frequency linear array transducer. (7 -
12mhz). Images will be obtained prior to any other measurements in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_55848] [ADDRESS_991930]. Extended -field-of-view will be used to visualize the entire fascicle length with linear 
extrapolation used when need ed used digitizing software (Moreau, 2013). A blinded  assessor will use  
 Figure  4. Experimental design for 8 -week interventions and timeline for assessment. TT = treadmill training  

Protocol v 7_02/11/22    external software (OsiriX 7.0.3) to calculate muscle architecture outcomes from de -identified ultrasound 
images from both sites  (post -analysis) . 
5) Muscle Performance:  Muscle performance measures of muscle power (11), rate of force development 
(RFD) (12), and strength (12, 41) will be tested on an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Pro System 3) for 
the knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors according to standard procedures previously published by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Moreau in this population. An electromyographic ( EMG ) system (Motion Lab System) will be used to record 
muscle activity bilaterally from the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, medial and lateral hamstrings , anterior 
tibialis, and medial gastrocnemius . Torque, position, velocity, and EMG data will be collected 
simultaneously during the muscle performance tests as previously described in detail by [CONTACT_726393] (42). Briefly, subjects will be in a sitting position in the dynamometer chair with 
the tested joint axis lined up with the axis of rotation and thigh and waist strapped to the chair to prevent 
extraneous movements. The knee and ankle will be allowed to flex and extend according to directions for 
each measure. Participants will be instructed to push as “fast and hard as possible” during testing. Muscle 
power and strength will also be tested on the training device described under intervention protocols (Total 
gym). The leg press will begin with the knee at [ADDRESS_991931] of force and 
velocity.  
6) Participation:  Mobility related participation in daily life will be documented by [CONTACT_726394] -report of 
selected items from the Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), Gait 
Outcomes Assessment List (GOAL),  and Activity Scale for Kids (ASK) (35-37). These questionnaires have 
been validated in this population (35 -37). Parental report involves the parent’s interpretation of their child’s 
activities and participation.  
 
Fidelity of Assessments (SA 1,2,3):  Assessment fidelity between sites for SA1 and [ADDRESS_991932] Moreau/Bjornson, using consistent walk test distance metrics, 
demonstrated StepWatch/GPS calibration/donning, and an assessment visit pr ocedural reliability checklist of 
visit tasks/tests to standard of 100%. Site PIs will monitor and confirm assessment visit fidelity at every 10th 
study visit (10% of visits) over the study data collection period. Ultrasound imaging fidelity (SA 2) will be  
addressed by [CONTACT_5203] -time videoconferencing of [CONTACT_726403] by [CONTACT_726395] (25% 
of visits) and was implemented effectively with recent R21 pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Fidelity of muscle performance data 
collection (SA 2) will be addressed bet ween sites by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -person training by [CONTACT_726396]/ per site observation every 10th visit (10% of visits) throughout the study data collection period with 
assessment visit procedural reliability checklist of visit tasks/tests t o a standard of 100%. Training videos and 
manuals will be provided for reference for all of the outcome assessments. In addition to on -site training, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_726368] 6 months to 1 year (see timeline C.8). [CONTACT_290714] and Bjo rnson will hold 
monthly conference calls to discuss study progress and any protocol deviations. The entire research team will 
meet quarterly using closed -circuit videoconferencing.  
 
Risks  to Participants  
The risks to the subjects for the locomotor treadmill training or walking capacity/performance testing would not 
be greater than risk during regular physical therapy gait training sessions.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], ambulation on a treadmill 
involves a risk of trippi[INVESTIGATOR_726369]. However, subjects will wear a gait belt w ith contact [CONTACT_726397]. 
Therefore, the risk of falling associated with this experiment is minimal. This fall prevention strategy has been 
effectively employed within the current R21 pi[INVESTIGATOR_47002] (R2 1 HD077186 -01A1) with no adverse events 
reported related to falls during the short -burst treadmill training. Participants will also be allowed to use the 
treadmill railings as need during the training.  
 
There is a mild risk of temporary delayed -onset muscle soreness from walking, power and strength training 
and testing , as well as joint pain, particularly in the knees . However, [CONTACT_290714] has previously performed 
maximum strength and power testing and training protocols in the lower extremity in both CP and typi[INVESTIGATOR_726370] . Reports of joint injury  are rare . In order to minimize physical risks, these 
protocols have been designed according to the latest resistance training guidelines for children and 
adolescents put forth by [CONTACT_726398] (NSCA) position papers for youth 
Protocol v 7_02/11/[ADDRESS_991933] for appropriate fatigue, muscle soreness, joint pain, 
falls and/or unexpected physical discomfort during intervention and testing sessions.  
 
There is minimal risk of blisters and/or chafing associated with training equipment used during the power and 
strength training and testing. This is no greater risk than standard of care physical therapy where a child is 
administered strength training. In order to minimize the risk of blisters and/or chafing, weight -lifting gloves will 
be provided to all sub jects during training.   
 
There are no known risks associated with ultrasound imaging.  
 
There is minimal risk of intolerance or skin issues with wearing of the StepWatch/GPS devices.  
 
The questionnaires/interviews completed by [CONTACT_726399]. If the participant were to experience any emotional sadness or discomfort as a 
result of the questionnaires, we wou ld refer the parent to an appropriate health care provider, such as a 
counselor or psychologist.  
 
Risks to the participants’ privacy are minimal and every effort will be made to maintain confidentiality with 
secured access and storage of data. REDCap ™ will be used for data management. REDCap ™ is a secure 
application designed for building and managing databases to allow electronic data collection from multi -site 
studies. Data management principles will be implemented to ensure the integrity, security, and confidentiality of 
all study -related da ta. 
 
Benefits  
Individual participants of this clinical trial have the potential benefit of improving their own personal walking 
capacity, walking performance, as well as community participation from the intervention. The muscle 
architectural adaptations and resulting improvements in muscle power gained from this intervention have also 
been shown to contribute to improved activity, participation, and even quality of life.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_726371]. Although the potential risks of participation to the 
subjects are considered  to be minimal, the safety of the subjects will still be monitored regularly by [CONTACT_7676].  
Specifically, Drs Moreau and Bjornson will conduct quarterly safety monitoring meetings to review information 
related to the safety of study participants and summariz e any adverse events.  
 
Adverse events will be collected from the start of treatment through the end of study participation. All adverse 
events regardless of attribution to treatment procedures will be collected and recorded. Participants will be 
asked in an open -ended way about the presence of any adverse events. The likelihood that the event is related 
or not related to treatment will be noted. Reporting of adverse events will use a grading and attribution scale 
(Grading = mild, moderate severe; Attribution = Definite, Probable,  Possible, Unlikely, Unrelated). Serious 
Adverse Events that occur to participants will be reported to the LSUHSC and Seattle Children’s IRB 
immediately. Should an unanticipated adverse event or outcome be discovered, [CONTACT_290713] or Bjornson will 
notify thei r respective IRB within 48 hours and proceed accordingly. Should there be a serious adverse event 
that occurs that increases the risks to the participants, the study will be stopped, an investigation will be 
conducted, and a findings report will be generat ed before the study is resumed. This study is a clinical trial with 
a relatively small number of participants in a vulnerable population (children with cerebral palsy). The 
experimental intervention and the comparison intervention propose low risk to the p articipants. [CONTACT_726402] 
will also monitor the data for any inconsistencies or outliers.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB): For this trial, we propose a [ADDRESS_991934] Trapi[INVESTIGATOR_726372], in order to provide an unbiased assessment. This study is a clinical 
trial with a relatively small number of p articipants in a vulnerable population (children with cerebral palsy). 
Protocol v 7_02/11/22    However, this study involves minimal risk (defined in 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subpart A, Sec. 
46.102), as the experimental intervention consists of power training combined with interval treadmill training, 
and the comparison intervention consi sts of treadmill training and strengthening. Resistance training and 
treadmill training are both components of standard physical therapy care. The combination of the two training 
modalities, including distinct differences in dosing parameters (intensity, v olume, velocity) between the 
experimental and comparison interventions, is being tested. Both interventions have been tested separately 
and combined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_726373]. Although this study meets the criteria for 
exemption, additi onal supplemental monitoring through an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 
will be implemented if requested by [CONTACT_22866].  
 
The DSMB will be charged with oversight and monitoring to ensure the safety of participants and the validity 
and integrity of the data. The committee will meet quarterly to review data and any reported adverse events. 
Any adverse events will be reported to  the Seattle Children’s and LSUHSC -NO IRB. At any time, the 
committee will have final authority to conclude the study without any further enrollment.  
  
Power Calculations:  The sample size calculations for Specific Aim [ADDRESS_991935] sizes for Specific Aims 1 & [ADDRESS_991936] estimates and from Moreau et al. (2013) for the comparison group effect estimates. Assuming 
a statistical model for a replicated randomized complete block experiment with fixed treatment factor (PT 3 vs 
comparison) and a 0.050 two -sided significance level, the null (primary) hypothesis of no difference in mean 
change from baseline to [ADDRESS_991937] 90% power to detect a 
difference of 0.12 m/s given a comm on standard deviation of 0.167 m/s with a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_991938] 79% power to detect a difference of 0.137 m/s in fast gait 
speed, assuming a common standard deviation of 0.127 m/s. Specific Aim 2: A  sample size of [ADDRESS_991939] 99% power to detect a difference in mean peak power of 0.819 watts/kg with a common 
standard deviation of 0.485 watts/kg with a 0.[ADDRESS_991940] 90% p ower to detect a difference in mean fascicle length of 1.[ADDRESS_991941] 
deviation of 1.61 cm. Specific Aim 3: Average number of strides per day (over a 5 day period) were obtained 
from Bjornson et al. (2014) with the differences observed bet ween GMFCS levels II and II used to approximate 
the expected differences between treatment groups. Assuming a common standard deviation of 1,580 average 
strides/day, a sample size of [ADDRESS_991942] 90% power to detect a difference in average strides/day betw een 
treatment groups as small as 1,510 strides/day. In the event that we experience dropout, the primary analysis 
of each aim will still have > 80% power to accommodate as high as a 25% dropout rate (n=19 per group).  
 
Data Analysis Plan:  The primary analysis will compare differences in changes from baseline to [ADDRESS_991943]. If significant gender 
effects are observed, we will report both adjusted and unadjusted estimates of treatment effects to more full y 
reveal the role of gender. Type I error rate will be set at 0.05. The primary dataset for analysis is the intent -to-
treat dataset consisting of all patients randomized to intervention. The Statistical Analysis System (SAS®),

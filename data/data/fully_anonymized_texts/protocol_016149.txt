of Leukocyte lnterleukin, lnjection [Multikine]Plus Standard of Care
(Surgery + Radiotherapy or Surgery + Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy)
in Subjects with Advanced Primary Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the
Oral Cavitv / Soft Palate Versus Standard of Care Onlv
Short TitleA Phase lll Study of the Effects of Multikine on Cancer of the Oral
Cavitv.
Protocol Number cs001 P3
Phase
Methodology Open label, randomized, three group study. See Table 1
Study Duration45-60 months (15-18 (or 24) months accrual and 30-36 months follow-
uo).
Study Cente(s) Multi-center. Approximately 90 sites, globally
ObjectivesThe primary objective is to determine the efficacy of peri-tumoral and
peri-lymphatic injection of Multikine (400 lU, as lL-2) given prior to
Standard of Care (SOC) as measured by [CONTACT_70085]. The
secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of Multikine treatment
on the cumulative incidence of loco-regional control, progression-free
survival, tumor response, tumor histopathology, and quality of life, while
confirminq Multikine safetv.
Number of Subjects 784 (completed subjects)
Diagnosis and Main
lnclusion CriteriaUntreated tumors of the oral cavity to include ONLY the oral tongue
(not the base of tongue), floor of mouth, cheek and soft palate that are
scheduled for SOC (surgery and radiotherapy or surgery and
concurrent chemo- radiotherapy). Other key inclusions: primary tumor,
and if present, clinically positive lymph node(s) measurable in two
dimensions, normal immune function, no immunosuppressive drugs
within the past year, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) > 70, age >
[ADDRESS_1257129],
Dose, Route,
Multikine RegimenStudy drug name: [CONTACT_896849], lnjection (Multikine) totaldaily
dose: 400 lU (as lL-2); Route: one half delivered peri-tumorally, one
half delivered peri-lymphatically (daily) by [CONTACT_896711],
Sx/week for 3 weeks.
Two treatment groups will get Multikine injections. Gro=up I will receive
Multikine preceded on Day minus 3 only by 300 mg/m'
cyclophosphamide (1.V. bolus), [ADDRESS_1257130] multivitamin formulation (hereinafter referred to as
Multikine + "ClZ Treatment) followed by [CONTACT_2946] (surgery of tumor and
involved lymph nodes + radiotherapy or surgery + concurrent
chemoradiotherapy). Group 2 will get Multikine without *ClZ (referred to
as Multikine w/o *ClZ) followed bv SOC. Group [ADDRESS_1257131] of Care (control): surgical excision of tumor and involved
lvmph nodes followed bv radiotheraov +/- concurrent chemotheraov
Statistical
MethodologyStatistical analysis of the Kaplan-Meier life tables, log rank tests, and
proportional hazard models comparing Multikine treatment regimen
(plus CIZ) plus SOC vs. SOC alone for overall survival (primary), loco-
regional control and progression-free survival over a 24 month
enrollment phase and a subsequent 30-36 month follow-up phase for
all randomized subjects. Additional evaluations of treatment on tumor
response using a longitudinal growth model and quality of life using
generalized estimating equations (GEE). Further assessment of the
prognosis of risk status, post-surgical therapy (radiation only,
chemoradiotherapy), tumor location (tongue, floor of mouth, cheek, and
soft palate), tumor stage (T1 N1-2, T2N1-2, T3 N0-2, T4 N0-2), and
geography upon treatment, including treatment interactions, using
proportional hazards models.

1. lntroduction
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 Part
312 and lnternational Conference on Harmonization guidelines), which have their
origins' and are based on the Helsinki accords, and applicable government regulations
and lnstitutional research policies and procedures.
l.l Background
Head and neck (H&N) carcinomas constitute 5%o of all new cancers diagnosed annually
worldwide and approximately 37,[ADDRESS_1257132] obstacle to the cure of these tumors. Approximately
ninety percent of all oral cancers are primary squamous cell carcinomas (SCCHN)
arising from the lining nly the tongue and floor of the
mouth2 3'4. Carc¡nom the mouth represent about 65% of
all oropharyngeal can of all H&N cancer patients) of
patients with SCCHN present with locally advanced disease6'7, at their first visit
(diagnosis), and have poor to very poor prognosrs.
Although the use of current therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) results in
a very high (>70 - 9O%) cure rate for early primary disease, review of the scientific
literature for clinical trials conducted with patients having locally advanced squamous
cell carcinoma of the head and neck, which have been treated with any or all available
treatment modalities (surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and
any combinations thereof) published in peer-reviewed journals between 1987 and 2006
indicates that, the median 3 year overall survival (OS) for locally advanced patients is
52o/o and the 5 year OS is 39%. A review of only the more recently (2004 - 2006)
published clinical trials (from the same data above) indicates that, the median 3 year OS
is 55% and the 5 year OS is 43%. Thus, there is a large number of locally advanced
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cancer patients that are not well served
by [CONTACT_896712].
Until recently ve

multimodality therapy is now a well-established strategy for the improved control of
these tumors.

The strategy of using concurrent chemoradiotherapy (with cisplatin as the
chemotherapeutic agent) following surgery in "High-Risk" patients was tested in two
clinical trials for which interim analyses were recently reported by [CONTACT_111557] (RTOG
9501/lntergroup) and the EORTC (EORTC trial22931) in the New England Journal of
Medicines n. The RTOG study reported a 10o/o increase in the 2-year rate of local and
regional control (p= 0.0t). An 11% increase in the S-year rate of disease-free survival
was reported by [CONTACT_51222] (p=0.02). Further the EORTC also demonstrated an
increase in survival (53% in the combined-therapy group vs. 40% on the post-operative
radiotherapy group alone (p=9.04). Neither trial reported a decrease in distant
metastases. ln addition, the incidence of severe early adverse events was significantly
increased by [CONTACT_896714]. Grade 3 toxicity or greater
occurred in 77o/o of patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy as compared
to 34% of patients who received radiotherapy alone (p=<0.001) in the RTOG study, and
in 41% vs.21% (p=0.01) in the EORTC study.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_896643], further improvements in treating patients with loco-
regionally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck are needed.
Support for this conclusion comes from the study outcomes reported by [CONTACT_896715] '' n. The estimated five-year cumulative incidence of local or regional relapses
was 31% in the radiotherapy group and 18% in the combined-therapy group in the
EORTC study. Similarly, local or regional recurrence as the first sign of treatment failure
occurred in 61 of 210 patients who received radiotherapV Q9%) and in 33 of 206
patients given combined therapy (16%).
lntra-tumoral and peri-tumoral immunotherapy with cytokines has been studied
extensively in animal models. Anti-tumor responses have been associated with the
development of an inflammatory response localized to the tumor mass. This therapeutic
approach has also been shown to overcome tumor-induced suppression of host
immune response. ln animal models, the local or peri-lesional administrations of
interferons, TNF and lL-[ADDRESS_1257133]'s defense mechanisms. Anti-tumor host defenses play an
important role in the course of malignant disease. Both cell-mediated and humoral anti-
tumor immunity are involved in this process. ln addition, a variety of approaches to
cancer treatment based on host defense mechanisms have also been developed.
These are currently referred to as immunotherapy or biologicaltherapy. Effective

melanoma, Hairy Cell Leukemia, AIDS-related Kaposi Sarcoma, and lL-[ADDRESS_1257134] category of cytokines. Cytokines with known anti-tumor activity in either
animal or human systems include interferon-cr, -B and -y, TNF-u, TNF-P, lL-1, lL-2 and
'L-4.
Regional intra-lymphatic or intra-tumoral low-dose cytokine therapy may have important
therapeutic effects. One group reported that squamous cell head & neck cancer
responds to peri-lymphatic low-dose natural lL-214. Others have established the
rationale for local cytokine therapy and the safety of the preparationls. ln humans, there
is good evidence for the activity of local / regional cytokine therapy of cancer in a
number of sites, including skin, genitalia, peritoneum, pleural cavity, brain, head & neck,
liver, and bladderl6' 17' 1a' 1s'20'21'22' " These data provide a part of the rationale for the
use of Leukocyte lnterleukin, lnjection (Multikine) in multiple solid tumors, and
encourage further studies not only of recombinant lL-2, but also of mixed natural
cytokine preparations, such as Multikine (an extensively characterized mixture of
naturally occurring human cytokines).ln head & neck cancer subjects, injection of lL-2 at 200 units (qd/10 days) into the
regional lymph node drainage (in the head & neck area) induced remission in squamous
cell carcinomal0. When tumors from these treated subjects were examined
histologically, cellular infiltrates were observed. Twelve subjects treated with I x 10s
units of lL-[ADDRESS_1257135] another trial, 8 x 105 units of rlL-2 were administered directly into the
tumor area in 20 head & neck cancer subje ,ts daily for [ADDRESS_1257136] another study with rlL-2, four
responses were observed in 46 head & neck cancer subjectsr3.
The presence of both Thr and Th2 type cytokines induced by a vaccination regimen is
analogous to the injection of Multikine peri-tumorally and in the regional draining lymph
nodes. Multikine, which contains biologically active, naturally occurring mixture of both
Thr and Th2 type cytokines, has induced both tumor reductions gnd lymphocytic
infiltrations into the tumors of subjects with head & neck cancer'". lt also appears to be
effective in improving pre-cancerous cervical lesions, as determined by [CONTACT_896716]
(colposcopy) and histopathological methods2s. These findings further support the use of
Multikine as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer.
Multikine neoadjuvanVadjuvant immunotherapy modulates both the tumor and host
antitumor immune response when administered peri-tumorally26 or both peri-tumorally

and peri-lymphatically to advanced primary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)
patients, prior to conventional therapy2T. Multikine promotes a number of putative
beneficial immunologic effects:
f . induction of tumor cell entry into the pool of dividing cells increasing their
sensitivity to follow-on treatment with radiotherapy,26 chemotherapy or combined
chemoradiotherapy,
2. the inversion of the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio in the mononuclear cells infiltrating
the tumor 27, and
3. a decrease in both the tumor and tumor-stroma macrophages 27' 28'. The
reduction of Macrophages in the tumor site has recently been correlated with a
marked decrease in lung-metastases of mammary tumors (and a general
decrease in the tendency of mammary tumors to metastasize)2s.
ln addition, in a recent Phase ll trial of Multikine in advanced primary OSCC patients
MHC ll (HLA Class ll) expression of the OSCC tumor cells was completely absent in
tumors from patients responding to Multikine treatment (having >30o/o tumor reduction
from baseline) (n=6), while the Multikine treated but non-responding group (n=11) and
the disease matched pathology study historical controls (n=20) had similar HLA Class ll
expression on their OSCC tumor cells (pcO.05)28. MHC Class ll expression on tumor
cells has been correlated with poor prognosis in melanoma patients3o'31.
These potentially beneficial immunologic effects have been achieved with no added
toxicity in all clinical trials of Multikine, and support the rationale for the use of Multikine
as adjuvanVneoadjuvant immunotherapy in primary OSCC of the head and neck.
Multikine (developed by [CONTACT_896717]-SCI Corporation) contains a defined mixture of naturally
derived and naturally-occurring human cytokines and chemokines with demonstrated
immunomodulatory activity in-vitro and in vivo in animals and man. lt has been
administered as a neo-adjuvant peri-tumorally and peri-lymphatically in various dosage
schedules in Phase I and Phase ll clinical trials conducted in patients with advanced
loco-regional squamous cell head and neck cancer (See Sec 1.4). Multikine
administration was welltolerated and was found to be safe in allthe studies at allthe
doses administered by [CONTACT_896718]. ln addition, data from these studies suggest
Multikine pre-treatment may impact the rate of tumor recurrence and/or delay the time to
recurrence in patients with primary advanced disease.
Based on the clinical and pathology data collected and the fact that Multikine imparts
anti-tumor immune activation, which constitutes an additional anti-tumor mechanism of
action different and distinct from radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy
with little to no toxicity, Multikine has the potentialto increase the effectiveness
associated with follow-up radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with
primary advanced head and neck cancer.

ln this Phase lll trial of Leukocyte lnterleukin, lnjection (Multikine) in locally advanced
oral squamous cell carcinoma, overall survival (OS) at 3 years is the primary end point
and local regional control (LRC) at 2 years and progression-free survival (PFS) at [ADDRESS_1257137] the hypotheses that Multikine
adjuvant (or neoadjuvant) immunotherapy administered prior to surgical resection of
tumor and involved lymph nodes followed by [CONTACT_896719]:
. extend the time of overall and progression free survival. enhance local/regional control. improve quality of life
Collection of survival data for 3 years is expected to allow sufficient comparison of the
treatment groups. The studies conducted by [CONTACT_896720] t't demonstrated
overall survival curves whose slopes decrease in the initial 2-3 year interval and are
nearly flat (after the 3 year mark) to [ADDRESS_1257138]'s development is that the
local/regional injection of "mixed interleukins" (Multikine) would overcome local immune-
suppression (induced by [CONTACT_7879]), break tolerance to tumor antigens, and allow for an
effective local anti-tumor immune response to occur.
Multikine's proposed mechanism of immune augmentation is depi[INVESTIGATOR_144625]. 1 below:

CEL-SCI believes that Multikine mode of action is due to its unique and proprietary
composition of matter. Multikine is a naturally derived cytokine product containing,
among others, three major "families" of bioactive molecules. Each cytokine has a
distinct effect on the host and the tumor, and the sum of all effects synergistically impact
solid tumor destruction (i.e., regression / necrosis) in cancer patients.
Multikine, injected peri-tumorally and in the region of the local/regional draining lymph
nodes contains (1) tumoricidal/tumoristatic cytokines (e.9., TNFcr,, TNFP, lFNy), (2)
chemotactic cytokines and chemokines (e.9., RANTES, lL-8, MIP-1c¿, MIP-1P) and (3)
lymphoproliferative and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.9., lL-1, lL-2 and lL-6, TNF).
CEL-SCI and the authors of a recently published article depi[INVESTIGATOR_896645] a
Multikine phase ll trial (Timar et al, JCO, 23(15): May 2OO5)28 hypothesize that Multikine
mode of action is due to the combined activity of the different cytokines present which
induce a cascade of events as follows:

1. tumor necrosis factors present in Multikine (such as TNF-o) attack the tumor to
release tumor antigens2. antigen presenting cells (e.9., dendritic cells) transport the newly released tumor
antigens to lymph nodes
3. lymphoproliferative cytokines (present in Multikine administered peri-tumorally
and peri-lymphatically, e.9., lL-1 ,lL-2) induce a marked polyclonalexpansion of
tumor specific T-cells - primarily in lymph nodes
4. Multikine (cytokines/chemokines) recruits CD4+ T-cells from local lymph nodes
via chemotactic factors, and reverts the balance of intra-tumoral CD4+|CD8+
cells in favor of CD4+ T-cells, which further upregulate the antitumor immune
response, resulting in tumor cell necros¡s,

Multikine), which propagate the destruction of the tumor cell nests

1.2.2 Manufacture
Multikine is prepared under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) manufacture from
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including T-cells, B cells and macrophages.
The cells are separated by [CONTACT_896722] "buffy coats" obtained
under contract from the American Red Cross, and subjected to tests for viruses,
bacteria, and parasites, and all other tests mandated by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA for blood for
transfusion and blood derived products (including HlV, HBV, HCV, HTLV, STDs, West
Nile Virus, ALT and NAT testing). All buffy coats must be negative for alltests in order
to be accepted for Multikine manufacture. ln addition, all units are obtained only from
repeat-donors who were not in any deferral category, either at the time of current or
past donation. Viable PBMCs are cultured with PHA for 24 hours. Subsequently, the
culture supernatant is aseptically harvested. The supernatant is clarified, subjected to a
commercialvirus exclusion process, concentrated (approximately 10 times) by
[CONTACT_452410], and subjected to microfiltration. Subsequently, Human Serum Albumin, lnj.
USP or equivalent is added, the concentrate is buffered to physiological pH and brought
to a target lL-2 concentration of 200 lU/ml, then subjected to a second microflltration
(0.22 micron-rated filter). lt is then aseptically dispensed into a sterile serum vial and
labeled by [CONTACT_896723]-2.
Product potency is measured by [CONTACT_896724] a
cytotoxic T-lymphoid line (CTLL-2). The final injectable agent is further tested (by
[CONTACT_6428]) for the presence of five marker cytokines: lL-2, lL-1B, TNF-o, IFN-y, and
GM-CSF. Leukocyte lnterleukin, lnjection is subject to quality control tests for identity,
sterility, bacterial endotoxins, pH, and total protein concentration. Each vial is inspected
for particulate contamination and appearance. ln addition, data is collected on the

Multikine Phase l/ll (Head & Neck - lsrael)
Multikine was administered peri{umorally to subjects with head & neck cancer in an
attempt to augment local/regional anti-tumor immune responses and achieve local
tumor control.
Twelve subjects with previously untreated, primary (stages ll to lV) squamous cell
carcinoma of the oral cavity (9 subjects), facial skin (2 subjects) and a neck lymph node
metastasis with an unknown primary tumor ([ADDRESS_1257147]) were given a treatment regimen
that included peri-tumoral injections (10 subjects - 800 lU lL-2 equivalence and 2
subjects - 1600 lU) of Multikine daily, 5 days/week for [ADDRESS_1257148] injection of Multikine.
Subjects also received pretreatment with cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2 on Day -3 only,
indomethacin, 25 mg po tid, and zinc supplementation, 50 mg po qd) for 18 days
immediately following pretreatment. At the completion of the treatment regimen (before
surgery), the subjects displayed one or more anti-tumor responses consisting of
reduction in tumor surface dimensions, including one complete clinical response of aT2
retromolar trigone tumor and a neck lymph node metastasis with an unknown primary
response and four with tumor reductions (of >50%), reduction in tumor thickness,
resolution or reduction in size of tumor ulceration, subsidence of local pain and increase
in tongue mobility (in tongue tumors). There were no tumor progressions or other
adverse local changes, nor evidence of systemic toxicity. Recovery after operation and
wound healing were normal. Microscopic examination of surgical specimens showed
cellular immune infiltration into the tumor and tumor necrosisas.
Gonclusion: This well-tolerated, short-term local regimen resulted in 6/10 responders,
four (4) of which had >50% tumor reduction and one (1) had a complete clinical
response, while the other complete responder had a complete reduction in an affected
neck node - with an unknown primary. The treatment may impact the rate of tumor
recurrence and/or delay the time to tumor recurrence (see below) in subjects who are

Multikine Phase I lHead & Neck - US / Ganadal
CEL-SCl has completed a Phase l-ll multicenter, randomized, dose-response, open
label trial of Multikine plus cyclophosphamide, indomethacin and zinc sulfate (ClZ) in
biopsy confirmed advanced head and neck cancer patients, who had failed prior
therapy. The objective of the trial was to demonstrate clinical safety, evaluate pi[INVESTIGATOR_896648] a possi ble M ultikine dose-response relationshi p.
The study was conducted under BB-lND 5677 and Canadian IND 033575. Patients
initially received monotherapy with Multikine at one of four escalating doses (200, 400,
800 or 1600 lU as lL-2) subcutaneously in a peri-tumoral, intra-tumoral, or perilymphatic
location at the discretion of the investigator. Depending on their response to the therapy
patients could receive up to 5 subsequent cycles of therapy consisting of Multikine in
combination with cyclophosphamide injection (300 mg/m'), oral indomethacin (25 mg po
tid) and oral zinc sulfate (142 mg po qid). The first treatment course was [ADDRESS_1257151] treatment course Multikine was
administered once daily on Days 1-5 and 8-12, in subsequent courses it was
administered once daily on Days 4-8 and 11-15 of each course.
One patient completed all 6 courses of therapy, three completed 5 courses, three
completed 4 courses, ten completed 3 courses, fourteen completed 2 courses and all
sixteen completed the initial course of treatment. One patient began treatment course 2
but did not complete it, and 1 patient who entered treatment course 4 did not complete
it. Fifteen patients discontinued participation in the study, 13 because of progressive

Thirteen severe adverse events were reported during the study. None of these were
attributed to the treatment regimen by [CONTACT_431]. Only two adverse events were
considered "possibly related" to therapy: moderate hyponatremia and mild asthenia.
Seven deaths occurred during the study. The deaths were not unexpected, given the
advanced nature of the patients' disease and were not drug-related. Five were related
to the patient's malignancy and two were unrelated.
Currently available information indicates that none of the patients in the low dose group
had a complete response or partial response, but therapy did result in decreased or

stable tumor size in about half of patients assessed after two courses of treatment. lt
was not possible to demonstrate a dose-response relationship for Multikine in this trial,
perhaps due to small sample size.
Conclusion: Multikine when administered alone and as part of the regimen including
cyclophosphamide injection, daily indomethacin and oral zinc sulfate was safely
administered and well tolerated at all doses administered in this trial. A final report of the
efficacy results is pending, however, given the improvement or stabilization of most
patients who received two courses of therapy and the safety of Multikine when given
alone or in conjunction with ClZ, additional studies are warranted in the group studied
and other patient groups.
Multikine Phase ll (Head & Neck - Canada)
CEL-SCI enrolled 28 patients in a multi-center, Phase ll dose escalating clinical trial in
subjects with previously untreated, advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the
oral cavity.
This study was a Phase l-ll trial of Leukocyte lnterleukin, lnjection (Multikine) in patients
with head and neck cancer. The study was conducted primarily to determine the safety
of a 3-week dosing regimen of Multikine in combination with cyclophosphamide,
indomethacin, and zinc (CIZ) in patients with advanced disease (Multikine was given
three times weekly in two of the dosing weeks), and to evaluate indications of efflcacy.
The study had an open label, multicenter, ascending dose design. Following screening
and at least three weeks before tumor treatment by [CONTACT_896729], each patient was given a single injection of
cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 lV, an 18-day regimen of indometh acin [ADDRESS_1257152] had a
history of alcohol consumption and long term tobacco use. The mean age was 60.1
years and the majority (85.7Vo) were male. Most patients (89.3%) had stage ll or lll
disease.
Almost all patients were stable in terms of primary tumor growth following treatment with
Multikine. Clinically positive lymph node size changes were variable, and changes in

size did not appear to be dose-related. Tumor characteristics did not change in most
patients following treatment, though pain/tenderness was decreased in those patients
who did have a reduction in tumor surface area. Both the patients and medical staff
assessed well-being as stable or improved, and other health assessments as stable in
most patients.
Multikine was found to be safe and well tolerated. No deaths or serious adverse events
occurred during the study regimen. The most common drug-related adverse events
were local effects of mild severity. No clinically significant toxicity, changes in laboratory
values or other safety measures occurred during the study.
Conclusion: No serious adverse events attributable to Multikine were reported in this
trial. Multikine is safe for use in this patient population, and indications of potential
efficacy suggest that further studies with Multikine are warranted.
Multikine Phase ll (Head & Neck - Hunqarvl
The results of a fully enrolled, multi-center, dose escalating Phase ll clinical study in
advanced primary head & neck subjects conducted in Hungary are summarized as
follows: Twenty-seven (27) disease matched tumor tissue samples were obtained from
the National Oncology Center (Hungary), the lead center of this multi-center clinical trial,
and served as the control group for a follow-on histopathology study. Multikine was
administered peri-tumorally six times over a two week period to the first three groups of
advanced primary OSCC patients [8 subjects -200|U, as lL-2 (per day), and to 12
subjects - at 400 lU/day and to 7 subjects - 800 lU/dayl for a total of ten times over a
two week period, peri-lymphatically plus a one-week wait period before surgical
resection of the residual tumor. Preliminary safety data corroborates the lack of toxicity
seen in previous studies. Furthermore, preliminary results (from one site, The National
Cancer lnstitute, Hungary) demonstrated the lack of recurrence in the first eight (8)
sequentially treated patients at 24 months + post treatment with Multikine (which was
followed by [CONTACT_896730]). At the same clinical site, approximately 50%
of these type of patients (undergoing surgery for the primary tumor and affected lymph
nodes - followed by [CONTACT_114658]) are expected to present with recurrence of disease at

study, Multikine was administered Sx/week for 3 weeks, and 20 additional disease

withdrawn from the study, due to a severe adverse reaction (severe pancreatitis), which
was related (exclusively) to the anti-retroviral medication she was taking. Multikine
treatment of HIV/HPV co-infected women had a direct effect on HPV virus infection of
the cervix (reduction in the number of HPV viral types by 75o/o), as measured by [CONTACT_954]

1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits
Previous dose escalation studies in animals and humans have tested Multikinedoses
up to 3200 lU/day for [ADDRESS_1257155] treatment has shown infiltration of tumor by [CONTACT_398]3+, CD4+ and CD25+ T-cells, tumor
necrosis and a dose dependent, cell cycle activation of tumor cells in the tumor bed,
which is characteristic of cells' becoming increasingly sensitive to chemotherapy and
radiation therapy.
ln total, over 200 patients treated with Multikine had no reported serious adverse events
associated with Multikine neoadjuvant / adjuvant immunotherapy in clinical trials
conducted in the US, Canada, Europe and lsrael. Because antitumor activity has
consistently been demonstrated at the proposed dose (between 400-800 lU, as lL-2)
with concomitant activation of tumor cells in the tumor, a dose of 400 lU was chosen for
this phase lll study. Although not the maximum dose tested, this dose is safe, well
tolerated, and achieves antitumor effects (T-cell infiltration, tumor necrosis and
regression, and cell cycle activation of tumor cells). A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
not being sought, in this trial, as this type of therapy is not anticipated to have a toxicity-
based limit.

Overall survival will be accessed via a Kaplan-Meier life{able and compared using a log
rank test and confirmed further with stage-, location-, and geographic-stratified log rank
tests. The unstratified logrank test constitutes the primary analysis. Further details on
the statistical analyses can be found in section 7.9.
2.2 Secondary Objectives
The following secondary comparisons are also planned
(1) Overall survival in Multikine + SOC vs. SOC
(2) Progression Free Survival in Multikine + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC
(3) LRC in Multikine + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC
(4) OOL in Multikine + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC
(5) Examination of the histopathological nature of cellular tumor infiltration
stimulated by [CONTACT_896734]
2.3 Tertiary Objectives
The tertiary objectives of the study include

[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Rationale
It is now widely recognized that Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and
Neck (SCCHN) and its treatment may significantly affect patients'functioning in
basic areas such as eating, speaking and socializing, alLoJwhich may, in turn,
have a profound influence on overall quality of life50's1' 52' 53' 54. Particularly in
advanced disease, treatment is aggressive, multimodal and confers significant
acute toxicity and functional impairment. Perhaps of even greater concern, are

the potential late effects, which may
well as overall quality of life.55's6'57Protocol No: CS001P3
interfere long term, with specific functions as
Suroery: Treating head and neck cancer (HNC) by [CONTACT_896742], voice loss, and difficulty chewing and/or swallowing.
ln addition, some patients experience excessive drooling, choking, respi[INVESTIGATOR_896651], impaired vision, and a decreased sense of taste and smellsT'ut. All of
these side effects have been associated with moderate to severe distress,
negative self-image and disturbed interpersonal relationships5s'60'61'62. A review
of the literature suggests that the most commonly cited late effects of surgery
include (percentage reflects % of patients reporting moderate to severe
problems) : disfigurement (-50%); voice loss/disturbance (-50%); difficulty eating
(chewing, swallowing) (30%-40%); decreased activity (-3970); pain (25%-50%);
these percentages are derived from various studies63'64' 65' 66of heterogeneous
groups of HNC patients treated with surgery + radiation therapy. Other data also
suggest that larger tumors and more extensive surgery, which generally result
from a larger tumor, confer even greater morbidity6Y' oel bg' zo' zt'72'zs.
Radiation Therapv: Radiation therapy (RT) has long been used alone or in
combination with surgery to treat HNC and both the severe acute and long-term
sequelae are widely recognized. The literature documents oral toxicities and
compl ications, fu nctional and performance impai rments, patient reported
symptoms and side effects as well as consequences to QOL. The following list
summarizes the most commonly cited late effects of radiation therapy and the
percentage of patients reporting moderate to severe problems in that area.
These percentages are derivedfrom various studies56'7a'75'76'77of heterogeneous
groups of HNC patients treated with radiation alone: xerostomia (dry mouth)
>66%; difficulty eating/ swallowing 350/o-680/o; sticky saliva -33o/o; decreased
sense of taste 25o/o-50%o; dental problems 33%; pain 15o/o-30o/o; appearance
20%o-25o/o. ln one study of 240 oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer patients treated
with an aggressive investigational regimen,2SVo of patients were still feeding
tube dependent 2 years after treatment 77 to 95% of patients had a dry mouth
after six months, while 66% had not recovered at one year; a finding, which is
consistent with many radiation therapy type studies.

and long term impact of the radiotherapyTs'7s'80. Most patients recovered from
acute toxicities, but some problems (e.9., dry mouth, diet restriction) persisted
years after treatment cessation.
Multikine: ln general, the addition of any furthertherapy, particularly in the
induction phase, prior to scheduled definitive therapy, has the potential to: a)
increase subsequent therapy related toxicities and worsen quality of life, b)

decrease subsequent toxicities by [CONTACT_896743] (and either minimizing tumor
related impairments or leading to tumor downstaging and in turn, a possible
reduction in subsequent surgical resection, radiation fields or dose) or c)
effecting no change in immediate or long term toxicities. ln addition, one needs to
address the potential impact of the additional treatment itself. As proposed in this
protocol, Multikine will be administered by [CONTACT_896744] 5 days/week for three
weeks prior to surgical resection. As presented in Section 1.4, limited data
suggest that Multikine is well tolerated without substantial acute or long term side
effects or sequelae. However, further data are needed to more fully document
the impact of Multikine on QOL and performance both in and of itself as well as
an adjunct to further therapy. Questions related to pain at the injection site,
possible downstaging or possible aggravation of subsequent therapy, require
further evaluation. Thus, while traditional efficacy endpoints are undeniably
critical considerations, assessment of the patient's QOL and performance is
important to the comprehensive evaluation of the success of this new treatment
regrmen.
[IP_ADDRESS] Quality of Life Objectives
The proposed treatment regimen aims to improve overall survival, loco-regional
tumor control, disease free survival and possibly impact distant metastases while
minimizing performance and QOL deficits. Thus, QOL and performance
assessment are also important treatment objectives. The objective is to describe
these dimensions prospectively, pretreatment, through treatment, to long-term
follow-up. QOL specific aims are to:
. Evaluate changes in QOL and performance as affected by [CONTACT_896745].. Document patient's experience of treatment effects.. Determine extensiveness and persistence of QOL and function-related
treatment effects.. Describe the pattern, timing and extent of recovery of function and QOL.
[IP_ADDRESS] Quality of Life Assessment
Quality of life assessments will be performed for the first time prior to
randomization (but following enrollment and signing of the informed consent by
[CONTACT_896746]), and then following Multikine administration up to 1 day
prior to surgery and at about, 6, 12, 18, and 36 months after completion of
therapy.

For SOC subjects, assessments will be at baseline prior to randomization - as
above and then again prior to surgery, and at about 6, 12, 18 and 36 months
after completion of therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment lnstruments
The EORTC QLQ - C30 version 3 core questionnaire will be used in combination
with EORTC QLQ-H&N3S specific to head and neck cancer. Both the core
questionnaire and H&N35 are validated instruments used in multi-cultural setting.
The instrument has demonstrated ability to assess the functional, performance
and quality of life domains germane to SCCHN, and sensitivity to change over
time.
The EORTC QLQ-C3O consists of 30 questions covering general health aspects
in cancer patients. The disease-specific EORTC QLQ H&N35 consists of 35
questions covering aspects of head and neck cancer. The core questionnaire
and disease-specific questionnaire in totalwill contain 65 questions. The
instrument is self-administered by [CONTACT_748] (or can be completed by [CONTACT_896747] a qualified healthcare provider). Validated translations for
EORTC QLQ-C3O and EORTC QLQ-H&N35 are available in most major
languages such as English, Spanish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Portuguese, French,
Polish, Russian, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hebrew and many lndian languages
(Bengali, Gujarathi, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil,
Telugu).
A scoring manual will be provided with details on scoring procedure for the
subject's responses to the questions posed by [CONTACT_20368]-C3O and
EORTC QLQ-H&N35 Questionnaires.

4.5 Withdrawal and Discontinuat¡on of Subjects
4.5.[ADDRESS_1257163] Discontinuat¡on
This study will be conducted under the intent-to-treat-principle (lTT). This means
that once a subject is randomized to a treatment group, he or she will remain in
that treatment group and should follow his or her protocol defined sequence of
visits regardless of whether the subject receives the assigned study medication,
and regardless of the extent of the subject's compliance with dosing. A subject
may be discontinued from study medication for a number of reasons, some of
which are listed below, but this does not automatically mean the subject is
discontinued from study follow-up. Reasons for discontinuing study medication
include the following:
1. lf a subject has documented evidence of progressive disease or
symptomatic tumor progression after administration of SOC or Multikine
followed by [CONTACT_2946].
2. lf the investigator thinks a change of therapy would be in the best interest
of the subject.
3. lf the subject requests discontinuation, withdraws consent for any reason,
or is unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements.
4. lf the study drug exhibits unacceptable toxicity that does not respond to
dosage modifications.
5. lf a subject becomes pregnant after enrollment in the trial, or fails to use
adequate birth control (for those subjects who are able to conceive).
Study personnel should make every reasonable effort to åncoutage subjects to
continue with the follow-up schedule even if the subjects are not receiving study
medication, or did not receive a full regimen of study medication.
Subjects who need to withdraw from the study for a period of time, but are willing
to resume should be encouraged to do so. Likewise, subjects who are unable to
attend all protocol visits but may be able to attend a subset of visits should be
encouraged to do so. Subjects who miss a visit should be contact[CONTACT_896758] (if applicable) and follow-up.

The study will be closed once the targeted number of deaths are observed; this
is expected to take place 30-36 months (the duration of follow-up is event driven)
after SOC (as defined in this protocol) has been administered to the last enrolled
subject. lnvestigators will collect survival information after study closure for all
subjects who have been involved in the study and have not withdrawn their
consent for three (3) years following randomization.
4.5.2 Study Discontinuat¡on by [CONTACT_896759]/or any investigative site at
any time. Reasons for terminating the study and/or investigative site may include
the following:
1. The incidence or severity of an adverse event (AE/SAE) in this or other
studies indicates a potential health hazard to subjects.
2. Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory.
3. Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.
4. Good Clinical Practice (GCP) procedures are not being followed.
The sponsor will not have access to, or base the decision to terminate a clinic on
unblinded data. Subjects from a site where enrollment has been terminated will
continue to be followed under the intent-to-treat principle, at the terminated site
or at an alternate site.
4.5.[ADDRESS_1257164]¡on and Follow-up for Withdrawn Subjects
All subjects must be followed for safety evaluation (Section 8) until the time of
study discontinuation or study closure (Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 respectively). At
the time of discontinuation, all procedures and evaluations scheduled for the last
visit of the study must be performed (Section 6.3 and as indicated). The reason
and date of study discontinuation will be recorded for all subjects. As noted
above, it is essential that all subjects be followed as long as possible, and as
completely as possible even if they have not received Multikine, or have only
received a partial regimen, unless they have withdrawn consent.

5. Study Drug
5.1 DescriptionProtocol No: CS001P3
Multikine (Leukocyte lnterleukin, lnjection) is provided frozen in a borosilicate
glass-serum-vial containing2.2 mL of drug at 200 lU (as lL-2) per mL for peri-
tumoral, intra-tumoral, peri-lymphatic or subcutaneous administration. The
preparation has a total protein content of 3 mg/ml. The drug is stored frozen in
the pharmacy at -20oC until needed. The vial contents may be thawed at
ambient temperature just before use, and the drug is allowed to reach ambient
temperature before injection. lf thawed at ambient temperature, the drug must be
injected within 4 hours.
Multikine may also be thawed at refrigerator temperature (2'-8oC) one day
before use, and allowed to come to ambient temperature just prior to injection -
either way of thawing the drug vial, is acceptable. However, the overnight thaw at
2"-8oC temperature is preferable as the drug may be kept for up to an additional
24 hours at 2'-8oC temperature after thawing, if the subject did not arrive in the
clinic - once the drug is brought to ambient temperature it must be used within 4
hours (of reaching ambient temperature) or be disposed of. See Appendix 11 for
speciflc instructions on Drug Vial Thawing Procedure.
5.2 Treatment Regimen
Subjects randomized to one of the Multikine treatment groups are scheduled to
be treated with or without ClZ. Multikine, 400 lU (2 mL) is injected each day of
study drug administration,l12 dose (1 mL) peri-tumorally and 1/2 dose (1 mL)
peri-lymphatically at the jugular lymphatic chain ipsilaterally to the injected tumor
site inferior to the tip of the mastoid process in the area of the sternomastoid
muscle (See Appendix 3) sequentially and during the same visit. Both injections
(peri-tumorally and peri-lymphatically) are administered 5 times per week for 3
weeks. lf scheduled to receive ClZ, subjects will also receive 300 mg/m2
cyclophosphamide (lV bolus on Day -[ADDRESS_1257165] Multikine injection) and 25 mg
indomethacin (tid po daily with food from Day l to one day prior to surgery).
Additionally, a multivitamin supplement containing zinc is given from Day 1 to the
day before surgery for immune system/nutritional support. These medications
are to be recorded on the concomitant medication Case Report Form (CRF). At
the discretion of the investigator, a local anesthetic may be administered prior to
Multikine injections.
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
The entry criteria of eligible subjects will be reviewed upon enrollment and a
study number and treatment group (Multikine +l- CIZ plus SOC or SOC alone)
will be assigned via randomization. Upon acceptance, the study site will be

notified of the treatment assignment. Subjects randomized to Groupl and 2
(Multikine +l- CIZ plus SOC) must begin treatment within 7 days of study
randomization.
An lnteractive Voice Response System (IVRS) will be used for randomization
and stratification. Randomization sequences will be computer generated and
maintained by [CONTACT_21926]. Subjects, who meet all eligibility requirements and
complete screening evaluations, will be randomly allocated in a 3:3:1 allocation
with Multikine + SOC (without CIZ) being the treatment group to be assigned
least often in contrast to Multikine + CIZ + SOC and SOC alone. The IVRS will
employ a dynamic randomization procedure to ensure balanced treatment
assignment within the arms of the trial for each of the following stratification
factors: tumor location (tongue, floor of mouth, cheek, and soft palate) and tumor
stages lll and lV (Table 3 below), within each country, such that each group
(Multikine + SOC and SOC alone groups, respectively) will have as near to as
the same number of subjects that are in each of the prospectively stratified sub-
groups throughout the whole study. The dynamic algorithm (Pocock and Simon
1975: Taves 1974) 81'82'is designed to balance treatment assignment along the
marginal distribution of each factor.

5.4 Preparat¡on and Administration of Study Drug
Pharmacy instructions will be provided separately. Multikine is supplied sterile
and pyrogen free in 5 mlvials containing2.2 mL,400 lU (as lL-2)lvial and is
stored frozen at -20oC. Prior to use, the pharmacist will remove the vial from the
freezer and place it in the refrigerator to thaw overnight (Appendix I 1). After
thawing of the investigational drug, the appropriate protocol and subject
identification information are entered onto a label, which is then affixed to the
vial, recorded on the drug accountability record and the CRF for each subject.
The drug is then ready for use by [CONTACT_49885].

Amendment #3 Protocol; 27 June 20'14, Version 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No: CS001P3
When a subject is in the clinic and is being prepared (readied) to receive the
injections of Multikine, the clinical staff shall prepare two separate sterile syringes
each containing no less than 1 mL of Multikine (A vial of Multikine contains
approximately 2.2 mL of drug) and each syringe will have a separate sterile
needle (needle size at the discretion of the administering physician.
Note: Recommended needle size smaller or equalto G-25).
Multikine is injected (one half the daily dose) 200 lU (as lL-2) into the submucosa
at the peripheral margin of the tumor (peri-tumorally), and peri-lymphatically (one
half the daily dose) 200 lU (as lL-2) at the jugular lymphatic chain ipsilaterally to
the injected tumor site inferior to the tip of the mastoid process into the
sternomastoid muscle (sequentially and at the same visit) (Appendix 3). An
approximately equally subdivided volume [e.9., 1 ml (112 dose)] is injected in a
minimum of four equally spaced sites: i.e., near either extent in the longest
dimension of the tumor and near either extent at right angles to and at the
midpoint of the longest dimension of the tumor [Appendix 2A: Technique of Peri-
tumoral, Subepi[INVESTIGATOR_896656] (Multikine), Figures 1
and 21. When the anatomical location of the tumor does not allow injections to be
made completely around the tumor (e.9., bone adherence or invasion), Multikine
is injected in approximately equal volumes at a minimum of four sites around the
injectable accessible portion of the tumor margin (Appendix 28, Figure 3). lf
Leukocyte lnterleukin, lnjection (Multikine) is observed to leak out of the needle
channel, the number of sites injected may be increased and volume per site
reduced (e.g., 8 sites at 0.125 mL for 200 lU peri-tumoral dose, Appendix 24,
Figure '1) to ensure drug retention. Peri-lymphatic injections are administered as
described in Appendix 3: Jugular Region Peri-lymphatic Administration of
Multikine (200 lU peri-lymphatic).
5.5 Monitor¡ng Subject Compliance
Except for administration of concomitant medications required per protocol
(multivitamin supplementation and indomethacin self administered by [CONTACT_1766]),
alltreatments are to be administered by [CONTACT_896761]. Compliance with
concomitant medication administration by [CONTACT_896762].
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All concomitant medication for subjects will be recorded on appropriate case
report forms. There is no prohibition on medications administered to subjects for
normal medical care except administration of any immunosuppressant drugs
(e.9. Cyclosporine), or administration of concomitant anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

dermatological conditions topi[INVESTIGATOR_896657] [<5% of Body
Surface Area (BSA)I are permitted as per investigator clinicaljudgment. Drugs
for analgesia may be used during Multikine injection. Subjects may also receive
nutritional support and drugs to control nausea and vomiting to be used as
indicated.
Cytokines, biological response modifiers and growth factors may not be used for
six (6) weeks prior to and during the protocol regimen as these may be
confounding to the interpretation of the results. However, if it becomes necessary
to use these agents to treat toxicity induced by [CONTACT_896763], they may be
used. Use of these agents will be documented including the specific indication for
use in the CRF.
5.7 Packaging
Multikine is packaged in 5 ml vials containing 2 mL of Multikine (200 lU/mL) and
is stored frozen at approximately -20oC C a "C). lt is thawed and administered
as described in Appendix 1 1. An overage of 0.2 mL is also contained in each
vial.
Multikine is packaged in bulk in 50 vial/ boxes for use in creating a "Subject Kit"
(by [CONTACT_896764]). Packaged treatment kits contain 15
vials of drug/carton ("Subject Kit"). Two (2) extra vials are shipped for each kit (of
[ADDRESS_1257166]) - for a total of [ADDRESS_1257167] Kit, shipped to
the institutional pharmacy. This is done as a precautionary measure in the event
of a mishap with a vial. The number of "Subjects Kits" shipped (all via courier) to
the institutional pharmacy will be a sufficient quantity of study drugs to treat the
number of subjects anticipated to be enrolled at each investigational site. Kits will
be contained within an outer shippi[INVESTIGATOR_896658]-frozen packs (U-
Teck or a validated equivalent) for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_896659] -20oC (or below, for
shipment only, +/- 5"C allowed).
Each "Subject Kit" will be labeled with the name [CONTACT_115210], protocol
number, IND number, unique subject and IVRS number and FDA mandated (if
applicable) warning(s) and any specific or unique to country information
mandated by [CONTACT_1606]/local laws for such an investigational drug (if any) . The
"Subject Kit" label will also have space for the subject's unique lD and unique
IVRS number to be entered at each site.

5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return/Destruction of
Drugs
5.9.1 Receipt of Drug Supplies
The study drug distributor will store study drug frozen and ship the "Subject Kits"
to each investigative site upon written instruction from the sponsor. Prior to drug
receipt, each site must have completed a pre-study site assessment (conducted
by [CONTACT_170281]), signed a clinical trial agreement, and have IRB
approval for the study protocol and informed consent.
Upon receipt of the "Subject Kits" and other supplies an inventory must be
performed and a drug receipt log filled out and signed by [CONTACT_896765]. Study drug (Multikine, "Subject Kits") must be stored at -20oC
immediately upon receipt. lt is important that the designated study staff counts
and verifies that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment
inventory at each institution. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_896660] [ADDRESS_1257168] notify the study
sponsor of any damaged or unusable study drug that is supplied to the
investigator's site immediately by [CONTACT_350986]. Damaged drug will
immediately be segregated and placed under "Quarantine" (at each site) and so
labeled. Damaged or unusable supplies will be replaced via IVRS notification.
5.9.2 Storage
Multikine is stored at -20"C for long-term storage (+l- 1oC preferred, however, +/-
3oC excursions are allowed). Only transient temperature excursions are allowed
and all are required to be documented on a temperature execution log. Multikine
is shipped at -20'C (or lower temperature for shipment only, +/- 5oC allowed).
The investigational drug is thawed just prior to use as described in Section 5.[ADDRESS_1257169] basis (controlled by [CONTACT_896766]). Each subject will use one (the
same) drug kit for the duration of the treatment. After a subject is enrolled, the
subject's identifying information, subject lD number and subject's initials will be
fonruarded to the pharmacy by [CONTACT_896767] 5.4

above. The pharmacist will designate a kit for treatment for a specific subject by
[CONTACT_896768] (given by [CONTACT_896766]) on the kit label. That
kit will be used for the exclusive treatment of that subject. The pharmacist will
dispense study drug on a daily basis for the subject (from the subject specific kit),
as required per protocol.
5.9.[ADDRESS_1257170] at each investigative site. Any discrepancies noted will be
investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of unused
study drug to the local/central drug depot for complete drug accountability in this
study. Drug destroyed on site will be accounted for and documented in the study
files and will be as per study site standard operating procedures (provided both
drug and drug labels are completely destroyed). A copy of each institution's drug
destruction protocol will be collected. lf directed by [CONTACT_456], study drug may
also be returned to the sponsor or its designee. Separate instructions will be
provided for study drug returns by [CONTACT_896769].

chemotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) regimen.
Study subjects randomized to SOC only group (Group 3), will be scheduled for
surgery as soon as practicable but within I - 38 days of
enrollmenUrandomization. Multikine treated groups (Groups I and 2) will be
scheduled for surgery between Days 29-38 following enrollmenUrandomization
(however, Groups [ADDRESS_1257174] sooner, if medically
indicated). Surgery will consist of complete surgical resection of tumor and
involved nodes as indicated, followed by [CONTACT_447]-operative radiation therapy.
To clarify, in subjects where regression of tumor or lymph nodes is observed at
surgery a more sparing surgery than what was planned at randomization should
NOT be performed. The surgical plan and its execution (wide-margin tumor
resection and neck dissection) as decided on at study entry (randomization) for
each subject must be strictly followed, regardless of any response which may
have occurred in the time between study entry and surgery.
Note: All subjects in this trial that undergo surgery will also receive at least
radiation therapy following the surgical procedure (per protocol).
Histopathological examination of excised tumor margins is necessary to confirm
complete resection and assist in the determination of whether the subject is
"High Risk". Subjects who are considered "High Risk" (i.e., having involvement of
2 or more lymph nodes or extracapsular nodal spread or positive tumor margins)
will receive concomitant chemoradiotherapy (per protocol as described below). A
general description of procedures is as follows:

6.4.3 Radiotherapy
lntensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is the latest method of increasing
the therapeutic ratio of radiation treatment. There have been no reports of
prospective randomized clinical studies using IMRT, therefore IMRT's impact on
clinical outcome is not known, and the technique carries with it a number of
potentially difficult problems that still need to be addressed. With IMRT, it is
much more difficult than with 3D conformaltherapy to verify that treatment has
been delivered correctly to the subject. At present, IMRT is not the standard of
care for the treatment of head and neck cancers; however, selected subjects
may benefit from this new technology if they are treated in centers that have
expertise in IMRT.
This protocol stipulates that adjuvant radiation therapy is delivered using
conventional external beam techniques with standard radiation fractionation. ln
instances where the investigator has reason to believe that deviation from this
prescribed radiation administration schema would materially benefit the subject
with improved outcome, a waiver to change the radiation therapy treatment plan
would be granted by [CONTACT_1758]'s medical monitor, but only on a case by [CONTACT_45677].

An independent Radiotherapy Quality Assurance Committee (iRTOA) will be
formed and will conduct radiotherapy QA, to assure radiotherapy (RTx) quality.
The committee will have responsibility for assuring that all participating
institutions have the equipment, personnel and procedures necessary to
administer radiation in doses that are clinically comparable to those of other
participating institutions The monitoring tools to be used may include on-site
dosimetry and ports reviews; remote auditing tools and adequacy of proposed
radiation therapy per site anthropomorphic phantoms and reviews of benchmark

Cisplatin powder for injection is reconstituted by [CONTACT_1583] 10 or 50 mL of sterile
water for injection to a vial labeled as containing 10 or 50 mg of the drug,
respectively, to provide solutions containing I mg/mL.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacology and Pharmokinetics (Cisplatin)
The dominant mode of action appears to be the inhibition of incorporation of DNA
precursors although protein and RNA synthesis are also inhibited. Cross linking
of DNA has also been shown. Plasma levels of cisplatin decay in a biphasic
mode with an initial half-lite oÍ 25 to 49 minutes and a secondary phase ranging
from 58 to 73 hours. This prolonged phase is due to protein binding which
exceeds 90% of the radioactivity in the second phase. Urinary excretion is
incomplete with only 27 to 45% of the radioactivity excreted in the first five days.
Although this drug seems to act as an alkylating agent, there are data to indicate
that its mode and sites of action are different from those of nitrogen mustard and
standard alkylating agents. Also, there appears to be potentiation of other anti-
tumor agents by [CONTACT_896782], animal tumor models and in early
human work. Studies have shown that cisplatin has no cell cycle dependency
and that cytotoxicity of this agent is similar in all stages of the cell cycle.
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicity (G isplatin)
Toxicity includes nausea, vomiting, alopecia, decreased Mg and Ca, elevated
SGOT and SGPT, anorexia, renaltoxicity (with elevation of BUN, creatinine and
impairment of endogenous creatinine clearance), ototoxicity (with hearing loss
which initially is in the high frequency range, as well as tinnitus), and
hyperuricemia. Much more severe and prolonged toxicity has been observed in
subjects with an abnormal or obstructed urinary excretory tract.
Myelosuppression, often with delayed erythrosuppression, is expected. The nadir
white cell and platelet counts occur at about two weeks with recovery generally
at about three weeks after initiation of therapy. Peripheral neuropathy and acute
myeloid leukemia have been reported in a few cases where long-term cisplatin
was used in combination with other forms of therapy.

will be tumor or positive lymph node(s) defined by [CONTACT_13407]. The
most appropriate imaging modality determined by [CONTACT_896784], digital photography using
rulers, X-ray, CT scan or MRl. The same imaging modality will be used for
subsequent tumor assessments at scheduled follow-up visits after surgery
and radiochemotherapy.
2. The histological characteristics of the resected primary tumor will be
reviewed by a qualified pathologist. Clinically positive lymph node(s) will
also be evaluated by [CONTACT_896785] (they) is (are)
positive, negative or show(s) evidence that it (they) was (were) previously
positive, but cancer cells are either no longer present or have undergone
necrosis. Tumor cell activity and host immune responses will be compared
for changes in these parameters per se, and for correlations with changes
in the size of the primary tumor before and one day or just prior to surgery.
The Study definitive histological evaluations of tumor specimens (frozen
and/or paraffin block) for the trial population will be conducted by a Central
Pathology Laboratory. lt is intended that sections obtained from all
subjects participating in the trial, along with sections similarly collected
and processed from untreated subjects, will be evaluated for T-cell and
other white blood cell infiltrations into the tumor and in the marginal tissue
around the tumor as well as other tumor cells parameter (Appendix 4).

6.7 Genomic Microarray - A Stand Alone collaborative study
(with the US NIH/NGI) that derives its samples from the subjects
of this Phase lll study
For those subjects who have consented for the genomic microarray study, two
samples of tumor (and any clinically involved lymph nodes) biopsy specimen (as
well as PBMCs) will be collected. One sample will be collected before treatment
(e.9., injection of Multikine) at time of screening (FNA or core/punch biopsy) and
another sample will be collected at the time of surgery from the surgical
specimen. Samples for the genomic microarray study will be obtained from
patients only in those countries where the health authorities have approved of
this testing. Subject participation in the genomic microarray component of the
study, which requires lnstitutional Review Board (lRB) / lndependent Ethics
Committee (lEC) approval, is optional. Refusal to participate will not result in
ineligibility for the main part of the clinical study. Any subject that consents to
participate in the genomic microarray study will not be identified and the samples
obtained from all individuals will be blinded. ln no way will the samples be
traceable back to the specific individual that consented to allow their samples to
be tested for genomic microarray (in the collaborative study with the US
NrH/NCr).
6.7.1 Rationale for DNA Collection
Genetic differences within the population can be an important contributory factor
in inter-individual variability in response to drug and can also serve as a marker
for disease susceptibility and prognosis. An association between gene
expression and clinical outcomes may help to identify a population subgroup that
is likely to better respond to or better tolerate the drug thereby [CONTACT_896786]. Therefore; biopsy samples, as well as blood samples, will
be collected in this clinical study in order to help address emerging clinical issues
and to develop a safer and more effective personalized drugs in the future.
There are two parts to the genomic microarray component of this study. Part I
allows using tumor biopsy (FNA or core/punch biopsy at study entry, and tumor
samples obtained from resected tumors at surgery) and blood samples for
analysis of gene expression using genomic microarray. Pa¡t2 allows for the
storage of biopsy samples for future testing. Subjects will be given the option to
participate in Part 1, Part 2, both parts, or neither part of the genomic microarray
study (where local regulations permit).

lnstructions on sample handling, labeling, and shipment are given in Appendix 4.
The details of the subject will be blinded using unique code. A subject may
withdraw consent for genomic microarray testing at any time, and still remain in
the study. lf a subject withdraws consent for genomic microarray testing; any
biopsy sample extracted or obtained from the subject's blood will be destroyed,
provided that the sample has not yet undergone conversion to the blinded
format. The investigator must notify the sponsor (or designee) site contact, who
will request sample destruction using the withdrawal of consent for genomic
microarray testing form. The investigator will receive written confirmation from
the sponsor or designee that the biopsy sample for genomic microarray can be
destroyed before converting to non-identifiable blinded codes. lf the sample has
already undergone conversion to the non-identifiable format, then the sponsor or
designee will notify the investigator in writing.

tumor or lymph node) from all the subjects participating in this study.
The samples will be coded prior to shipment to the Central Pathology
Lab. The pathology lab reader will be unaware of the subject's medical
history, subject's treatment arm, or clinical outcome.

participating in this study. All images will be coded by [CONTACT_896787](s)
for reading by [CONTACT_896788](s) who will be unaware of the
subject's medical history, subject's treatment arm or clinical outcome.
(3) A Central Laboratory Data Genter - the central laboratory data
center, will house all clinical laboratory data (values) taken / recorded
for each subject participating in this study. All laboratory data (values)
will be coded prior to transfer to the central laboratory data center for
analysis. A central Medical Monitor will evaluate all the laboratory

7. Statistical Gonsiderat¡ons
7.1 Study Design
This is a Phase lll open-label, multi-center, randomized study to determine the
efficacy and safety of peri-tumoral and peri-lymphatic injection of Multikine
(400 lU as lL-21 daily dose for 3 weeks at 5 times per week) given prior to SOC
The following treatment groups will be enrolled:
(1) Multikine + CIZ + SOC
(2) Multikine + SOC
(3) SOC alone

Amendment #3 Protocol: 27 June 2014, Version 4 0
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No: CS001P3
7.2 Primary hypothes¡s and analyses
The primary hypothesis will compare overall survival in the Multikine + CIZ +
SOC group to that in the SOC alone group for superiority of the former.
Overall survivalwill be accessed via a Kaplan-Meier life-table and compared
using a log rank test and confirmed further with stage-, location-, and
geographic-stratified log rank tests. The unstratified logrank test constitutes the
primary analysis. Further details on the statistical analyses can be found in
section 7.9.
7.3 Secondary Hypotheses and Analyses
The following secondary comparisons are also planned
(1) Overall survival in Multikine + SOC vs. SOC
(2) Progression Free Survival in Multikine + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC
(3) LRC in Multikine + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC
(4) OOL in Multikine + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC
The Holmsa closed-sequential procedure will be used to control the type I error
probability to at most 0.05. The analysis of the secondary hypotheses is
described in section 7.9.
7 .4 Tertiary Hypotheses and Analyses
The following tertiary comparisons are planned:
(1) Equivalence between overall survival in the Multikine + CIZ +
SOC vs. Multikine + SOC
(2) Tumor response in Multikine + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC
The equivalence between overall survival in the Multikine + CIZ + SOC vs.
Multikine + SOC will be explored by [CONTACT_2164] a 95% two-sided confidence
intervalto rule out a 10% 3-year overall asymptotic survival difference for
Multikine+ CIZ + SOC vs. Multikine + SOC. The analysis of the tumor response
is described in section 7.12.4 below.
Tumor response as assessed by [CONTACT_896790] (e.9., physical
measurement, CT scan, etc), is not expected to yield data that will reflect the
efficacy of this (Multikine immunotherapy) treatment. ln fact, it has been shown
in Phase I and ll studies that, tumor measurements were not reflective of the
tumor status in subjects treated with Multikine (or in other studies with immune

stimulating drugs). The reason for that is that through relatively short period of
time of drug administration prior to definitive surgical removal of the tumor (3
weeks in this study), the treatment with Multikine (an immuno-stimulatory drug)
markedly increases the immune cell infiltrate into the tumor bed, such that the
tumor may appear larger (by [CONTACT_896791]). However, when the
tumor is removed, at surgery, and tumor sections representative of the whole
tumor are analyzed by [CONTACT_56618], the pathology results indicate that the tumor
bulk is largely made of immune cell infiltrate and not tumor cells. Thus, physical -
dimensional measurement does not necessarily reflect on the efficacy of
immune-stimulating drugs, and tumor size change is not expected to be a useful
measurement for assessing the efficacy of this treatment modality.
7.5 Randomization
An lnteractive Voice Response System (IVRS) will be used for randomization
and stratification. Subjects will be randomized in a 3:3:1 allocation with Multikine
+ SOC (without CIZ) being the treatment group to be assigned least often in
contrast to Multikine + CIZ + SOC and SOC alone. Subjects will be stratified by
[CONTACT_1606], by [CONTACT_281794] (tongue, floor of the mouth, check and soft palate),
and tumor stage (Stage lll: and Stage lVa T4a (N0-2, T1-3N2) [see Table 3 -
TNM Categories and corresponding stage permitted in this triall.
A dynamic randomizationsl'82 will be used to promote balancing across study
sites within a country and globally.
7.6 Sample Size Rationale
Historical basis
Current SOC for SCCHN adopted by [CONTACT_896792] [includes: post-
operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRTx) or radiotherapy (RTx)l is based
on trials conducted by [CONTACT_156779] (RTOG - NEJM
2004; 350(19): 1937), and the European Organization for the Research and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC - NEJM, 2004; 350(19): 1945). Both trials
demonstrated improvements in the 3-year Overall Survival rates: an absolute
increase of 12 % (48% vs. 60%) for the EORTC study and an absolute increase
of 10o/o (47% vs. 57%) for the RTOG study.
This study will assume a 55o/o 3-year overall survival rate for SOC alone. This
assumes 7O-8Oo/o of the subjects will be lower risk at the time of surgery; sample
sizes will be smaller if a higher percent turn out to be at high risk. As for the
EORTC and the RTOG studies, a 10o/o absolute gain in overall survival is
regarded as being clinically meaningful. The primary study goalto test Multikine
+ CIZ + SOC superiority vs. SOC alone will be to reject the 55% 3-year overall

survival rate for SOC alone against a 650/o 3-year overall rate for Multikine + CIZ
+ SOC.
7.7 Assumptions and Galculations
The primary comparison will be based on 80% power and a two-sided 5% Type I
error to detect a 10o/o absolute survival advantage at 3 years (55% vs. 65%).
Assuming exponential hazards, this yields a hazard ratio of 0.721. For this
comparison, the log rank test will require a total of [ADDRESS_1257196] been observed.
Since death certificates should be available for virtually all subjects, the
calculations assume no losses to follow-up for overall survival. A 24 month (total)
recruitment period and a 30 month follow-up period yields a sample size of 336
subjects in each of the Multikine + CIZ + SOC and SOC alone groups. Under a
3:3:1 randomization, this yields 112 subjects in the Multikine + SOC group for a
total estimafe of 784 subjectsEs.
7.8 Study Populations
The key study populations will be defined as follows
lntent to Treat (lTT) Population:
All subjects who are randomized, regardless of treatment and trial
group (Multikine treatment or SOC), will be included in the ITT
analysis. The rationale for this is motivated by [CONTACT_65464]-label design.
Thus, investigators should make all efforts to ensure that subjects are
compliant, complete the protocol specified treatment regimen, follow
the subsequent standard of care regimen, and may be followed for up
to 36 months (duration of follow-up is event driven).a
aPer Protocol Population:
Phase ll clinical studies [ADDRESS_1257197] demonstrated that objective tumor
response in H&N cancer subjects requires at least 5 Multikine
injections (administrations) per week for a [ADDRESS_1257198] that a "minimum" number
of Multikine injections may be necessary for responses to be

demonstrable. Other studies have indicated a supportive role for
administration of Clz86' 87' 88' 8e in SCCHN. Factoring in an expected
low rate of "missed" injections (possibly 1-3, over a 3 week period), the
"per-protocol" subject population is defined as those subjects receiving
12 injections (administrations) over the 3 week treatment period.
Therefore, the per-protocol population will be defined as follows:
(a) Multikine + CIZ + SOC Arm (Group l): Eligible subjects receiving
12 Multikine injections (administrations) as randomized, having
completed surgery (as defined in the protocol) and receiving at least;
cyclophosphamide lV (as defined in the protocol), 2 courses of
cisplatin (if as a result of surgical findings the subject is slated for the
concurrent chemoradiotherapy sub-group treatment) and receiving
75%o of indomethacin, TS%o of scheduled radiation, and at least 75% of
all other protocol required treatments.
(b) SOC Arm (Group 3): Eligible subjects having completed surgery
(as defined in the protocol) as randomized and receiving at least two
courses of cisplatin (if as a result of surgical findings the subject will
receive the concurrent chemoradiotherapy as a sub-group treatment)
and receiving at least 75% oÍ all other protocol required treatments
(e.9.,75% of all scheduled radiation).
(c) Multikine Treatment + SOC Arm(Group 2): Eligible subjects
receiving 12 Multikine injections (administrations) as randomized but
without administration of any CIZ components, having completed
surgery (as defined in the protocol) and receiving at least 2 courses of
cisplatin (if as a result of surgical findings the subject will receive the
concurrent chemoradiotherapy as a sub-group treatment) and
receiving at least 75% of all other protocol required treatments (e.9.,
75% of all scheduled radiation).
Safety Population a
All subjects receiving any study therapy such as one or more injections
of Multikine, any CIZ components, or surgery will be included in the
safety population.

7.9 Missing Data ConventionsProtocol No: CS001P3
Subjects who are enrolled, but who do not receive Multikine treatment or surgery
(for the SOC group) will be replaced. Subjects who receive Multikine but do not
undergo resection will also be replaced. Data from the subjects that were
replaced will be included in the efficacy analysis for only the ITT population.
Subjects who are removed from the study for reasons related to drug toxicity will
not be replaced.
Tumor measurement, quality of life, and Karnofsky status will be analyzed using
longitudinal GEE models in the ITT analysis and in the analysis of treated per
protocol subjects (see Section 7.8 for definition). Missing measurements will not
be counted for treated subjects for any analyses; the actual sample sizes will be
noted to be different.
lf a subject cannot be contact[CONTACT_896793] /or letter
and/or due diligence, the subject will be deemed to be lost to follow-up and this
will be noted in the source document and CRF.
7.9.1 Statistical Analysis Strategy
Multiple analysis strategies are to be used in this study. These address study
design, study populations, data analysis, analysis confirmations, multiple
endpoints, data pooling, and interim assessments.
The choice of the study population is the ITT population for the primary and
secondary analyses because an open-label design is to be used. This means
that all randomized subjects are to be followed to the extent that this is feasible,
and included in all efficacy analyses as data permit. A per-protocol population will
be analyzed in selected analysis situations for confirmation; all p-values for the
per-protocol analyses will be regarded as descriptive.
Data analyses and confirmatory analyses are pre-planned to address multiple
complex situations. Life-table methods allow subjects to be used as long as they
have follow-up and investigators will be made aware at the time of study
activation that all subjects need to be followed for at least [ADDRESS_1257199]
for comparing treatments is the primary analysis, with supporting stratified log
rank and proportional haza¡d models to be analyzed for confirmation; the
stratified log rank and proportional hazard models are needed to address the
impact of correlated baseline factors and the potential for treatment interactions.
Risk factor analyses have a post hoc element since the determination is made
post-surgery and the Multikine regimens may impact the SOC choice if it can
affect tumor margins and positive lymph nodes pre-surgery.

CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No: CS001P3
Study site pooling will also be assessed. Sites with less than 14 subjects will be
pooled together into a combined site in the analyses for the primary and
secondary efficacy endpoints as well as the overall adverse event rate. For these
endpoints, a two-sided p-value >0.[ADDRESS_1257200] will be required to
pool data across sites; a site-treatment interaction will also be tested for the
endpoints; in the event of significant site-treatment interactions, baseline site
imbalance will be explored using proportional hazards analysis (for time to event
endpoints), longitudinal model analysis (OOL domains, Karnofsky status,
weight), or logistic regression (overall adverse event rate) including the tumor
stage, tumor location, and geographic strata variables, treatment, site, and
treatment-site interactions.
Prospective study subjects stratification will yield subgroup analyses that are
planned as an exploratory analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, OS, using
tumor location (tongue, floor of mouth, cheek, and soft palate), and tumor stage
(Stage lll and Stage lVa [see Table 3 - TNM Categories and corresponding
stage permitted in this Triall) and country.
Further prospective subgroup analyses may be identified in the statistical
analysis plan (SAP). Subsequently, subgroups may be identified on a data-driven
basis, and such analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis
generating only.
Finally, interlm analyses will be used to confirm Multikine safety expectations:
these safety analyses will be performed after the first [ADDRESS_1257201] completed the safety evaluation follow-up visit approximately 30 days (28-
35 days) following the last radiotherapy (or chemoradiotherapy) treatment.
Additionally, sample size assumptions and futility will also be analyzed as
requested by [CONTACT_896794] (lndependent Data Safety and Efficacy Monitoring
Board). Sample size re-estimation will be conducted on blinded data and prior to
any analysis that would require breaking the blind. No penalty is therefore
applicable since the study will not be stopped for superiority, unless so
determined by [CONTACT_941] |DMC in conjunction with the regulatory authority(ies) and the
sponsor.
7.1 0 Statistical Significance
For the primary and secondary efficacy measures, a two-sided p-value of 0.05 or
less will be considered to be statistically significant in comparing the Multikine
treatments vs. SOC alone for superiority. A Holmsa closed-sequential procedure

will be used to control the probability of type I error for the secondary
hypotheses.
7.11lnterim Analysis
lnterim analyses will be performed through the study to assess Multikine safety,
sample size assumptions, and futility. The first interim analysis will be performed
when [ADDRESS_1257202]'s complete surgery, and an additional safety
analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed the 30 day safety
follow-up visit (Day 28-35). Subsequent interim analyses will be performed as
mutually agreed upon with the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC)
and sponsor; the anticipated schedule is to perform interim analyses of safety
and efficacy every 6 months based on the study meeting enrollment objectives.
The iDMC will perform these semi-annual safety and effectiveness analyses
during the study to assess the feasibility of continuing the study and to assess
the sample size according to the primary study endpoint to see if the sample size
is adequate or requires modification (reduction or increase). This sample size re-
estimation will be conducted on blinded data, and prior to any unblinding. The
study will not be stopped for superiority but the study may be stopped for futility
(without penalty). Thus, the overall significance level of the final analysis (0.05)
will be maintained.
7.12 Analys¡s Approach
All analyses will be conducted under a prospectively approved statistical analysis
plan (SAP), which will display all database specifications and conventions in
addition to all planned tables, listings, and flgures. The SAP will be developed
under SOPs for data analyses and the SAP will be approved and implemented
prior to database lock. Any other analyses will be considered ad hoc.

7.12.[ADDRESS_1257206] criteria (Appendix 10). Tumors treated with
Multikine will be measured at baseline, (at the onset of treatment just prior to
Multikinetreatment), prior to the last weekly injection of Multikine, just prior to
surgery, to allow evaluation of tumor size changes. Thereafter, subjects will be
evaluated every [ADDRESS_1257207] 12
months, every 3 months to 2 years, and every 4 months thereafter to 3 years
(Appendix 1). lf evidence of disease progression or new disease is present, CT
scans and/or MRI of head/neck and chest will be performed.
Each tumor (injected peri-tumorally with Multikine) will be analyzed to include the
primary tumor as well as any clinically involved lymph nodes. These tumor
measurements will be used to determine tumor size changes. For each tumor,
the method of measurement selected at baseline must be the same throughout
the study.
Changes in tumor volume will be assessed using a longitudinal growth model
including all post-baseline measurements. A log normal distribution will be used if
goodness of fit assumptions warrant.
7.12.5 Progression
For subjects who progress (i.e. exhibit loco-regionalfailure), the pattern of
progression will be examined by [CONTACT_896795].
Progression defined as loco-regionalfailure includes progression of tumo(s) and
nodes or appearance of new disease above the clavicle (but not distant
metastases) following treatment. This definition also includes the reappearance
of tumor in the original tumor bed, development of cervical node metastases after
the treatment regimen and new disease above the clavicle (other than distant
metastases) not present at baseline. All progression of disease will be
documented on each subject's CRF.
Data will be collected on progression at sites not treated with Multikine and
documented in the CRF - including:. additional nodes. other local metastatic sites. distant metastatic sites

The number and percent of subjects in each category as well as the timing will
be displayed for each treatment group.

according to tumor stage, tumor location, and geography. Subjects who receive
confounding anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_896669] (i.e.
while on protocol) will be included in the overall survlval analysis and censored in
progression-free and loco-regional control analysis if progression was the reason
for initiating new treatment.
Proportional hazards models will be used to evaluate study treatment as well as
baseline covariates (tumor stage, tumor location, and geography). The
respective models will include interactions between treatments and tumor stage,
tumor site, and geography. Treatment will be modeled with the Multikine + CIZ +
SOC as the reference group to allow simultaneous comparisons to SOC alone
(primary comparison) and to Multikine + SOC (secondary comparison).
Additional analyses will be performed for the risk group assignment and for the
type of therapy administered (radiotherapy, concurrent chemoradiotherapy)
following surgery. The major prognostic factor for the subjects is the assignment
to either the "high risk" or "low risk" group (discussed in Section 1.1) made after
randomization, Multikine treatment and surgery. Thus, stratification at study entry
for this factor cannot be performed. As described above, stratified log rank and
proportional hazards models will be performed; the proportional hazards models
will include tumor stage, tumor location, and geographic location as well as
treatment.
7.12.7 Quality of Life
Assessment of quality of life will be based on the EORTC QLQ-C3O and EORTC
QLQ-H&N3S. The EORTC QLQ-C3O incorporates 30 items and consists of 5
functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and socialfunctioning), 3
general symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global QOL
scale, and 6 specific symptom scales (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation,
diarrhea, and financial impact). The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Head
and Neck35 (QLQ-H&N3S) is a supplement module to the QLQ-C30. Most items
are scored on a four-point response scale: 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much).

Questions [ADDRESS_1257209] 5 items are
answered as 'yes' or'rìo' concerning analgesia, nutritional supplemental, tube
feeding, and changes in weight.
Quality of Life (OOL) data will be scored according to the algorithm described in
the EORTC QLQ-C3O scoring manual. All scales pertaining to the EORTC QLQ-
C30 and OLQ-H&N3S range from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional or global
QOL scale represents a relatively high/healthy level of functioning or global QOL;
whereas a high score for a symptom scale indicates a higher level of symptoms
or problems. QOL data will be summarized using descriptive statistics for the
multi-item subscales at baseline and at each follow-up visit. Missing data points
for multi-item scales will be imputed using the method described in the scoring
manual where at least half the items from a given scale were answered. ln
addition, changes in QOL scores at each follow-up as compared to baseline and
the percentage of subjects achieving a 10 point improvement at 6 month, 12
months, 18 months and up to 36 months will also be summarized.
Quality of life data will be assessed for the change in QOL from baseline within
and between treatment groups. The comparisons between treatment groups will
be performed using ANOVA (or Wilcoxon rank sum test) while the change in
QOL from baseline within treatment group will be performed using a paired t-test
(or a signed rank test). Two-sided test will be used with no adjustment for the
Type I error. ln addition, a [ADDRESS_1257210] for between group comparisons.
7.12.8 Safety
All adverse events will be reported regardless of causality. Severity of AEs will be
graded by [CONTACT_896796] 4.0 (Appendix
8). The adverse events will be reviewed and coded by [CONTACT_896797]'s
representative using MedDRA. Using MedDRA, each adverse event will be
referred to by [CONTACT_82523]. The total number of events
and total number of subjects with events will also be displayed for overall safety
population and also for each system organ class and preferred term. Displays
will also be provided for the timing of adverse events (post-randomization, pre-
surgery, postsurgery during SOC, postSOC) to provide insight into the Multikine
related adverse events distinct from adverse events related to surgery and SOC.
Serious and unexpected adverse events will be summarized in a listing and
described by [CONTACT_625038]. Treatment groups will be compared at the subject level
using a Fisher Exact test and will be compared at the event level using a Poisson

model for the total counts. The cumulative incidence of adverse events at the
subject level will also be displayed graphically to help depi[INVESTIGATOR_896670]. Results will also be displayed separately for the post-
surgical treatment g roups (radiotherapy, concurrent chemoradiotherapy)
according to the randomized treatment group.
Laboratory data, including abnormal labs and clinically significant labs, will be
analyzed descriptively and subjected to statistical analyses for the change from
baseline through the end of treatment (pre-surgery, SOC, post-SOC). Laboratory
measurements will be investigated between and within treatment groups for the
pre-surgery treatment as well as for SOC using ANOVA (or a Wilcoxon rank sum
test) to compare treatments and using a paired t-test (or a signed rank test) to
compare changes from baseline. Shift tables will also be assessed using a
Fisher Exact test to compare treatments and using a marginal homogeneity test
within treatment groups. The incidence of clinically significant laboratory values,
as determined by [CONTACT_473], will be summarized and compared using a
Fisher Exact test.
8. Safety and Adverse Events
8.1 Definitions
8.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops
or worsens in severity during the course of the study. lntercurrent illnesses or
injuries should be regarded as adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic
procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:
. results in study withdrawal. is associated with a serious adverse event. is associated with clinical signs or symptoms. leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests. is considered by [CONTACT_1372]
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse
event is any AE that is:
fatal
life-threatening
requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]

results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
a congenital anomaly or birth defect
an important medical event or medically significant event in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_121523]
A life{hreatening adverse event is defined as any adverse experience that
places the subject at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred;
i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form,
might have caused death.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222969]-patient admission (even if less lhan 24 hours)
as a result of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment-emergent adverse event. For chronic or
long-term subjects, in-patient admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896671]/intensive care in-patient unit. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896672] a non-worsening preexisting condition should not be considered
adverse events (e.9. admission for workup of a persistent pretreatment lab
abnormality, yearly physical exam, protocol specified admission, elective
surgery, transfusion, or routine central catheter care). Preplanned treatments or
surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline documentation. However, if
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896673], it should be considered as a
serious adverse event. See also Section 8.7.
Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222970]-patient
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222971]/required for the original reason for
admission, as determined by [CONTACT_31598].
Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct
normal life functions.
lmportant medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening,
but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject,
and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted
above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896674].
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for a serious adverse
event are regarded as non-serious adverse events.
8.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected AE is an event not previously reported in or which the
nature or severity is not consistent with the current edition of the clinical

treatment group as well as the SOC group treatment). Particular attention should
be paid to relatedness of AEs to study drug, as these AEs will be compared to
those recorded for subjects receiving SOC only.
8.3 Pre-existing Gonditions
A pre-existing condition is one that is present at the time of enrolment. A pre-
existing condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency,
intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.
8.4 Physical Examination Findings
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a pre-
existing condition. Subsequent to screening, and until the end of the study, any
new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an
adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.

in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this
study.
8.5.1 Pregnanc¡es
lf the investigator becomes aware following administration of study drug, of a
pregnancy in a female subject, which occurred prior to or subsequent to the
drug's administration, the pregnancy will be reported, and follow-up
assessments/reports of any possible effects of the study drug on the outcome of
the pregnancy will be provided until the subject completes or withdraws from the
study.
lf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of
an SAE the investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_80381] a completed
SAER form to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the
event. The investigation of the SAE will be conducted and will determine the
relatedness (if any) of the study treatment regimen to pregnancy outcome,
should the pregnancy result in an SAE report and investigation. (Section 8.9.4).
8.6 Abnormal Laboratory Values
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if
any one of the following conditions is met:
The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm
the abnormality
The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity
The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of
dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further
diagnostic investigation, etc.
The event is possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug.
The event is of clinical significance as determined by [CONTACT_093].

8.13 lndependent Data Monitoring Gommittee (¡DMC)
An independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) will review interim data
according to the FDA Guidance: "Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors on the
Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees". The
iDMC will be formed to provide scientiflc and medical direction for the study.
The |DMC will focus on the following areas:
Efficacy - to assess the primary efficacy measure as well as the
conditional power and sample size
Safety - to assess the magnitude of adverse events and monitor for
safety concerns
The iDMC will consist of experts (clinical oncologists, radiologist, H&N surgeon,
pathologist and biostatistician) with experience in the treatment and analysis of
head and neck cancer patients who receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. They
will be provided with the lnvestigators Drug Brochure, study protocol and relevant
literature. The |DMC will operate under a charter and will provide prospective
data analysis and display specifications to conduct independent data reviews.
The |DMC will make recommendations to the sponsor to continue the study as
planned or to stop the study due to safety or lack of efficacy. The iDMC will meet
at least semi-annually to perform safety and efficacy evaluations and to make
recommendation to the sponsor. The |DMC reserves the right to request more
frequent evaluations. No sample size penalty will be imposed by [CONTACT_941] ¡DMC
evaluations since only recommendations to continue as is, to modify the sample
size, or to stop for futility will be made. The sponsor retains the right to accept,
modify, or reject the |DMC recommendations. The purpose of the ¡DMC will be to
assess frequency, causality and severity of toxicities of the subjects in the
protocol on a periodic basis. The iDMC will review all signiflcant Grade 3 and 4
toxicities as well as all unexpected adverse events possibly related to the study

rates and severities normally seen with this subject population and make
recommendations on the continuing progress of the study to the sponsor,
medical monitor and investigators.
The |DMC will be expected to review the protocol and lnvestigator's Brochure in
the context of the iDMCs analyses of the study data and to recommend any
changes judged necessary for investigators and EC's/lRBs to adequately assess
potential risks and benefits to subjects participating in the study. The iDMC will
make recommendations to the sponsor for changes to the protocol or
lnvestigator's Brochure; the sponsorwill again have the final decision to
implement iDMC recommendations.
The |DMC will also periodically assess the required sample size as well as the
conditional power. lf the new sample size is smaller than that calculated prior to
the study or if there are other indicators that the results are more favorable than
expected, the study will continue as planned so as not to incur the statistical
penalties that would normally be associated with a traditional interim analysis
involving superiority stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; in addition, the impact on the other study
endpoints will be taken into account in making a recommendation. lf the new
sample size is greater than that calculated prior to the study or if there are other
indicators that the overall effectiveness results are not as favorable as expected,
the sponsor may accept the iDMC recommendation that the study be expanded
or may make the decision to terminate the trial. ln the event that a decision is
made to expand the sample size, the impact of the final treatment effect will be
projected subject to the assumptions regarding enrollment, follow-up and
underlying hazard rates.

events will be assessed as well as safety events grouped in the time period from
randomization though surgery, in the 30-day post-operative period, and from the
30-day post-operative period through 30 days following completion of
chemo/radiation therapy. Descriptive statistics and tabulations of events will be

authorized representative) must provide consent in writing after having had
adequate time to ask questions and consider their participation in the study.
Consent must be obtained before any protocol related procedures that are not
part of the subject's normal care are applied to any subject in the trial. Written
documentation of consent must be provided by [CONTACT_10001]/lEC approved
informed consent document. The date and time the consent was finalized should
be recorded in the subject's medical chart. The subject or their legal
representative must receive a copy of a timed, dated, and signed consent form
according to ICH GCP guidelines. The exact definition of legal representative
should be determined for a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896683]/IEC in compliance with local and
state statutes. Subjects will be informed of any significant new finding developed
during the course of the research that may affect their decision to continue
participation.
11.2 Genomic Microarray Study
A separate independent and stand alone genomic microarray study will be
performed in conjunction with the NIH/NCl utilizing tumor specimens and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from a number of subjects
participating ln this study. The specimens will be collected at study entry and at
time of surgery from s.ubjects in this trial. To ensure subject privacy is protected
NO subject specific identifying information will be attached to or be allowed to
accompany any of the sample(s) shipped to the NIH/NCI. Neither will subject
specific data from which the genomic microarray study results will be derived be
able to be traceable back to any subject. The purpose of the genomic microarray
study is to determine if subjects whose tumor display a specific genomic array
will have a greater chance of being responsive to Multikine treatment than
subjects whose tumor lack the same genomic array pattern. lt is anticipated that
the data from this study will only become available at the end of the study after
all subjects have been dosed and treated and may in fact only become available
during or near the end of the follow-up period of this study.
11.3 Ethics Review
The protocols and local lnformed Consent (lC) forms must be reviewed and
approved in writing by [CONTACT_896820]' IRB/lEC prior to the
initiation of subject recruitment. Each of the IRB/IEC must be notified of all
subsequent protocol amendments. ln addition, progress reports will be submitted
to the IRB/lEC by [CONTACT_896821]/lEC's guidelines. A
copy of each of these IRB/IEC progress reports submitted by[CONTACT_896822]/lEC will be sent to the sponsor and sponsor's representative. Each
IRB/lEC must meet the FDA, and/or European Medicines Agency (EMEA), lCH,

14. Required Concom¡tant Medications
14.1 Cyclophospham¡de (USP or equ¡valent)
The chemical name [CONTACT_896851]:
2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)-amino]tetrahydro-2ï-1,3.2- oxazophosphorine 2-oxide
monohydrate.
lndications for cyclophosphamide include treatment of various solid
malignancies, acute and chronic leukemias, and various autoimmune diseases,
including nephrotic syndrome, Lupus erythematosis, Wegener's granulomatosis
and rheumatoid arthritis. The role of cyclophosphamide in this protocol is as an
immunomodulator to reduce T-suppressor cell activity.
ln animal tumor immunotherapy models and at least two human studies involving
tumor cell vaccines the immune response to antigenic immunization is markedly
augmented by [CONTACT_785069]. The presumed mechanism
of action is the abrogation of T-cell suppressor (and T-reg) activity, permitting a
more effective anti-tumor immune response, as a result of Multikine
administration.
A dose of 300 mg/m2 intravenously, as proposed in this protocol, is the dose
which has been shown to be active in the above described immunotherapy
models.a2' 44' 4s' 46' 47 This is a dose well below that which is used in cancer
chemotherapy. Doses of 500-600 mg/m2 are given in combination with other

cytotoxic agents, while as a single agent doses in the range of 1000 mg/m2 are
used. To date, there have been no reports of myelosuppression in the more than
[ADDRESS_1257226] received cyclophosphamide at the 300 mg/m2 dose being
evaluated in various CEL-SCl sponsored trials.
Cyclophosphamide, lnj. USP or equivalent is commercially available and is
supplied as a sterile powder containing 45 mg sodium chloride, 75 mg mannitol
or approximately 82 mg sodium bicarbonate per 100 mg cyclophosphamide for
reconstitution prior to intravenous injection or infusion.
14.2 lndomethac¡n (USP or equ¡valent)
The chemical name [CONTACT_896852]:
1 -(4-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl- 1 H-indole-3-acetic acid.
lndomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) and antipyretic agent.
lndications for indomethacin include anti-inflammatory activity in rheumatoid
arthritis and as an antipyretic in Hodgkin's disease. lt is further indicated in the
treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and osteoarthritis. lndomethacin is a potent
inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. lt has been demonstrated that monocyte and
macrophage-mediated suppression of the immune response is via the synthesis
and release of prostaglandins (e.9., PGE-2). The role of indomethacin in this
protocol is as an inhibitor of macrophage-mediated suppressor cell activity.
lndomethacin USP or equivalent is commercially available and is supplied in
capsules of 25 mg and 50 mg for oral administration. lndomethacin, 25 mg PO
three times daily (with food), is utilized in this study.
14.3 Nutritional Supplementation - Multivitam¡ns with zinc
Subjects with previously untreated, potentially curable head and neck cancers
exhibit high incidences of nutritional deficiencies and impaired immune
responses. Both nutritional status and immune competence have been
correlated with patient survival after definitive treatment of the tumors.
lmmune responses are reduced by [CONTACT_896826],
particularly vitamins A, B, C, D, E and zinc. These findings support the addition of
nutritional supplementation with vitamins to minimize deficiencies in cancer
patients that may impair immune responses and reduce survival rates after tumor
treatment.

Amendment #3 Protocol: 27 June 2014, Version 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No: CS001P3
To ensure good nutritional status, a commercially available multivitamin
supplement with zinc is used for self-administration by [CONTACT_896827].
14.4 Gisplatin lV Bolus lnfusion (USP or equ¡valent) (Section
6.4.41
Subjects with identified "High-Risk" factors [tumor margins unclear or infiltrative,
local invasion, nodal involvement (>2 lymph nodes or extracapsular nodal
spread)lwill receive chemotherapy (cisplatin, lV, bolus infusion) concurrently
with radiotherapy. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is currently adopted as the
standard of care for these high risk subjects and has been shown to result in
statistically significant increases in rate of local regional control, and in some
cases, increases in overall survival.
lf indicated, subjects will receive three courses of cisplatin lV bolus. Each course
of chemotherapy will consist of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) given as an lV bolus
infusion over 1-2 hours with pre-hydration and diuretics. Chemotherapy will be
given on weeks 1 , 4 and 7 of radiotherapy (or Days 1,22 and 43 of the
radiotherapy course) and concurrently with radiotherapy.

CIRCUMFERENCIAL INJECTION OF Multikine
E
D
Note: Product is to be injected in approximately equal volumes at
minimum of four sites around the injectable portion of the tumor margin.
The anatomical location of the primary tumor may prevent peri-tumoral injections
of Multikine at the entire circumference of the tumor. For example, in Figure 3,
proximity and adherence to bone may prevent injections of Multikine at points A-C
of the circumference of the tumor. ln such instances, the Multikine is injected
outwardly at equidistant points in the peri{umoral subepi[INVESTIGATOR_896691] (Fig.3, D-E).
After completing the three-week regimen of Multikine injections, labelthe sketch
of the primary tumor on the Case Report Form, Post Protocol Regimen,
PRIMARY TUMOR, with the locations (A-E) of the injection sites.

APPENDIX 3. Jugular Region Perilymphatic Administration of
Multikine
PROCEDURE
The subject is positioned in an otorhinolaryngeal examination chair with the head held
upright by [CONTACT_896828][INVESTIGATOR_415757]. The skin in the area of the mastoid process is cleansed
for percutaneous puncture. At the discretion of the investigator, a local anesthetic may
be administered to the proposed injection site. A 25 gauge, or smaller, needle is
introduced at a point 1.5 cm inferior to the tip of the mastoid process at the area of the
insertion of the sternomastoid muscle. The needle is inserted 1.5 cm and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_896692] a blood vessel has been punctured. lf there is no evidence of
blood vessel puncture, the specified dose of Multikine is injected without additlonal
manipulation of the needle. After each injection, the side of the neck to which the
injection was administered, the dose of Multikine injected and ANY DEVIATION(S)
thereof are recorded on the Daily Medical Treatment Case Report Form.
Selection of Injection Site
ln subjects who do not display clinical evidence of tumor metastatic to a regional lymph
node, the neck on the side of tumor is injected. With a clinically positive lymph node, the
neck on the side of the positive lymph node is injected, regardless of the location of the
primary tumor. With midline tumors and neck lymph nodes that do not display clinical
evidence of tumor metastases, one side of the neck is selected by [CONTACT_896829].
Contraindications to lnjection
lnjection is contraindicated if the skin of the proposed injection site shows acute or
chronic infection or inflammation, dermatological disease, pre-cancerous lesion or
cancer. lnjection is contraindicated if the neck on the side of the proposed injection has
had incisional (open) biopsy of a lymph node within the previous four weeks.
Procedure after Evidence of Blood Vessel Puncture
Multikine is not injected if there is evidence of blood vessel puncture. The needle is
withdrawn and re-introduced at 1.0 cm inferior to the tip of the mastoid process; i.e., 0.5
cm superior to the previous puncture site, and inserted to a depth of 1.0 cm, compared
with a 1.5 cm depth of insertion that led to puncture of a blood vessel. The performance
of this procedure and any deviations are recorded on the Daily Medical Treatment Case
Report Form.

Multikine Phase-lll Study: Tumor Sample Gollection and
Preparation Guideline and Histopatho¡ogy Protocol
(overview)
1. Prc-treafirent phase - Biopsy Guideline
A. Primarv tumor
(1) take one punch-biopsy for each 1cm of tumor size
(2) prepare freshly about 113 of sampled material taken for genomic studies, immerse
into an Eppendorf tube containing 0.5 ml RNA-later and send ice-cold to NIH Lab ([CONTACT_896853])
(3) fix the remaining [ADDRESS_1257228] case of more than one punched pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], embed each pi[INVESTIGATOR_896694]
(4) prepare H&E section from each paraffin block and store in local path archive one,
while send the paraffin block(s) to central path lab. (Blocks will be returned after
analysis).
English version of the original local path report excluding personal identification data
(PlD) must be sent electronically to the central pathology laboratory with paper copy of
the original path report excluding PlD.
B. Reoional lvmph node
ln case of clinical N positivity it is recommended to confirm it by [CONTACT_896830][INVESTIGATOR_40602] (FNAB) technique. Cytological smears are fixed immediately by
[CONTACT_131128]-containing fixative. Fixed smears are further processed in local pathology
laboratory using HE, Giemsa or Papanicolau staining.
ln case of multiple cytological smears, one representative is to be sent to the central
pathology laboratory. ln case of single smear it is possible to send a virtual smear after
scanning via lnternet to central pathology.
English version of the original local path report excluding PID must be sent
electronically to the central pathology laboratory with paper copy of the original path
report excluding PlD.
2. Postopentive (Surgical) sample Prcpantion - Guideline
A. Primary tumor
Surgical sample kept at 4oC, has to be sent to local pathology laboratory immediately
without fixation.
(1) after gross photography and marking of the resection surfaces representative
sample has to be taken from fresh unfixed tumor for frozen section. After fixation and
staining microscopic analysis must indicate the presence of tumor and stroma. This
frozen section and the native gross photo (electronic form) must be sent to the central
pathology laborarory. A parallel serial sample must be placed into Eppendorf tube

Dental Care for lrradiated Patients
Goals for a dental care program include
o reduce incidence of bone necrosrs.
o reduce incidence of irradiation caries.
o allow proper fitting of dentures following treatment
Pre-irradiation Gare and Procedures
The patients may be grouped into four groups in accordance with the problems they
present prior to irradiation.

cysts, infected retained root tips, or alveolar abscess and hyperplasia. These patients
require hygiene instruction and precautionary instruction about trauma with premature
use of a prosthesis.

lncludes those in whom dental hygiene is good. This includes patients who do not have
severe malocclusion in whom few carious lesions are present. Carious lesions are not in
close proximity to the pulp and are correctable by [CONTACT_483831]. These patients
require periodontal evaluation and dental prophylaxis training, restorations as needed,
no extractions prior to radiation therapy, and fitting for custom carriers.
Extraction of Teeth
lf extraction of teeth is necessary prior to radiation therapy, the bone must be contoured
so that closure at the extraction site is possible. All loose spi[INVESTIGATOR_896699]. The approximation of the gingival tissue must be such that the
closure is neither too loose nor too tight. At least [ADDRESS_1257236] of fluoride on the plaque
and flora that are present in the oral cavity. Adequate results are obtained by: 1)
cleansing the teeth thoroughly, followed by a good home care dental prophylaxis
program, 2) construction of fluoride carriers, custom-made mouth guards which provide
local application of fluoride solution to the gingiva and tooth surfaces. Fluoride carriers
are made individually with the use of casts. Material used for making a mouth guard is
"Sta-Guard" plastic used in conjunction with vacutrole unit produced by [CONTACT_896832], Corp., both of which are available through local dental supply. This material is
moulded to the cast impression and allowed to harden. A fluoride solution prepared at
the M.D. Anderson Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629490], lnc.,
Dallas, [LOCATION_007] [ZIP_CODE]. lt has been used to coat the plastic carrier for use in the mouth.
The patients are instructed to cleanse their teeth prior to placement of the carrier. lt is
then worn in place for 5 minutes each day. The patients are instructed to rinse their
mouths thoroughly following the use of the carrier. This will be continued for an
indefinite period of time. Close follow-up is necessary.

traumas. Conservative management should be tried first, though in more aggressive
lesions a more radical approach may ultimately be necessary.

CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No: CS001P3
APPENDIX 10. RECIST Response Griteria Version 1.0
At baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized as:
Measurable: Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > [ADDRESS_1257242] scan.
OR
Non- All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter
measurable: < [ADDRESS_1257243] scan) and truly non-measurable lesions.
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start
and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
Lesions that are considered as truly non-measurable include the following:. bone lesions,. leptomeningealdisease,. ascites,o pleural/pericardial effusion,. inflammatory breast disease,. lymphangitiscutis/pulmonis,. abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_896839],. cystic lesions.
Methods of Measurements
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.
lmaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_896840] a treatment.
Clinical Lesions
Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial
(e.9., skin nodules, palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation
by [CONTACT_6775] - including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion - is
recommended.
113

Version 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No: CS001P3
Chest X-ray
Lesions on chest X-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable. lt is assumed that
chest radiographs are performed erect, in the postero-anterior (PA) projection, in full
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. However patients in trials with advanced disease may not be well enough to
fulfill these criteria and such situations should be reported together with the
measurements.
Note: Lesions bordering the thoracic wall are not suitable for measurements by [CONTACT_13190]
X-ray, since a slight change in position of the patients can cause considerable
differences in the plane in which the lesion is projected and may appear to cause a
change that is actually an artifact. These lesions should be followed by [CONTACT_896841].
Similarly, lesions bordering or involving the mediastinum should be documented on CT
or MRl.
CT, MRI
CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure
target lesions selected for response assessment. When possible, oral or lV contrast
should be used to increase the differences in density between the structures. The same
imaging protocol should be used for successive evaluations of the same patients [same
machine (MRl), same timing for contrasts enhancement (CT), same slice thicknessl.
The same radiologist at an investigative site (named on FDA Form 1572) shall read all
slides (as far as possible) to ensure consistency.
CT and MRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of 10 mm or less in slice
thickness contiguously (this applies to the chest, abdomen and pelvis). Lesions should
be measured on "soft tissue" settings.
Note: Lung lesions should be imaged on both "soft tissue" and "lung" windows to ensure
that small, miliary metastases are not being inadvertently overlooked.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor lesions for objective response
evaluation. lt is however a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial
palpable nodes. Ultrasound might also be useful to detect new lesions that must be
considered for the overall response assessment.
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation has not yet been fully
and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated equipment
and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Therefore, the
utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to

Version 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No: CS001P3
validation purposes in specialized centers. However, such techniques can be usefulto
confirm complete pathological response.
Tumor Markers
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. However, if initially above
upper normal limit, they must return to normal for a patient to be considered in complete
clinical response when all tumor lesions have disappeared.
Cytology, Histology
These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (eg
after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant
lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).
Cytological confirmation of the neoplastic nature of any effusion that appears or
worsens during treatment is required when the measurable tumor has met criteria for
response or stable disease. Under such circumstances, the cytological examination of
the fluid collected will permit differentiation between response or stable disease.
New Techniques
New techniques to better investigate the objective tumor response (eg, PET scanning,
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_896701]) are currently being validated. However, standard procedures and
definitions to be used in the context of tumor response evaluation are not yet available.
Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response do not form a
part of this protocol.
Assessment of Overall Tumor Bulk and Measurable Disease
To assess objective response, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at
baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable
disease is defined by [CONTACT_896842] a diameter
(single dimension) > 20 mm. lf the measurable disease is a solitary lesion, its neoplastic
nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.
Baseline Documentation and Non-Tarqet Lesions
Tarqet Lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 leslons per organ, 10 lesions total
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be
recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of
their size (lesions with the longest diameter [LD]) and their suitability for accurate
repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the LD for

CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No: CS001P3
alltarget lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline
sum LD will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response.
Non-tarqet Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required,
but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.
Response Criteria Definitions- Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions.
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30Yo decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions
taking as reference the baseline sum LD.
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20o/o increase in the sum of LD of target lesions,
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the
treatment started or the appearance of one or more new
lesions.
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient
increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum
LD since the treatment started.
Evaluation of Non Taroet Lesions
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization
of tumor marker level.
lncomplete Response/Stable Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or the
Disease (non-CR) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions, and/or
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.

circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_896702].

Table [IP_ADDRESS]: Criteria Used for Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment
started).
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation
of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time
should be reported as "symptomatic deterioration". ln such cases, every effort
should be made to document any subsequent objective progression.
Conditions that may define "early progression, early death and inevaluability
are study specific and should be clearly defined in each protocol (depending
on treatment duration, treatment periodicity).
ln some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease
from normaltissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends
on this particular situation it is recommended to investigate the residual
lesion (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]/biopsy) before confirming the complete
response status.
Confirmatorv Measurement and Duration of Response
The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to minimize the risk of over-
estimation of the response rate. This aspect of response evaluation is particularly
important in non-randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint. ln order to
be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed
by [CONTACT_3611] [ADDRESS_1257244] once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6
to I weeks).
Duration of Overall Response

CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No: CS001P3
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are
met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement
criteria are first met for CR until the flrst date that recurrent disease is objectively
documented.
Duration of Stable Disease
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the
treatment started.
Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment
until disease progression/recurrence. ln generalthe patient's best response assignment
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

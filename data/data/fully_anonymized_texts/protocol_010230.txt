Safety Endpoints:  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
and serious adverse events  (SAEs)  
• Events of interest  (EOI)  
• Incidence of anti -drug antibodies  
 
Overall Design : 
Design:  This is a  randomized, double -blind, active -controlled , multicenter  study  
Study Population:  Adult s ubjects , including men and women between 18 to 75  years of age,  with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis  
Parallel :  Subjects will be randomized  (1:1) to Treatment Gro up A (ABP 654) or Treatment 
Group B (ustekinumab)  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will periodically review study data . 
Number of Subject s: 
Approximately  542 adult subjects  will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ABP  654 or 
ustekinumab stratified  by [CONTACT_286629]  (yes vs. no) , geographic region, and  
baseline body  weight  (BW) .  Subjects with prior biologic use for psoriasis will be capped at 50% 
of the  total randomized subjects .  The sa mple size  will provide greater than 95% power to  
demonstrate equivalence  at a significance level of 0.025 on PASI percent improvement from 
baselin e at week 12 with an equivalence margin of (-15, +15), assuming a common standard 
deviation of 30.0  (Leonardi, 2008 ; Papp, 2008 ) and a true mean difference of 0 with  10% 
drop-out. 
Intervention  Groups  and Duration : 
The t otal duration of study participation  for each subject  will be  [ADDRESS_349452] admi nistration of either ABP  654 or ustekin umab. 
Dose regimens:   ABP  654 (45 mg or 90  mg, subcutaneous [ SC] injection) and ustekinumab 
(45 mg or 90  mg, SC injection ). 
[COMPANY_010] Proprietary - Confidential  
[COMPANY_010], Inc   Clinical Study Protocol  
[ADDRESS_349453] , Dose, and  
Mode of Administration:  ABP  654 administered  by [CONTACT_286630] a blinded 
pre-filled syringe (PFS) at a dose of 45  mg (baseline BW ≤ 
100 kg) or 90  mg (baseline BW > 100 kg)  at weeks  0, 4, 
and 16.   Subsequent dosing will be done at the same dose 
every 12 weeks  (Q12W ) for subjects not requiring dose 
intensification (at the Investigator’s discretion ) or every 
8 weeks (Q8W) for subjects requiring dose intensification . 
Reference Therapy, Dose, and  
Mode of Administration:  Ustekinumab administered by [CONTACT_286630] a blinded 
PFS at a dose of 45  mg (baseline BW ≤ 100 kg) or 90 mg 
(baseline BW > 100 kg) at week s 0, 4, and 16.  Subsequent 
dosing will be done at the same dose .  Q12W  for subjects 
not requiring dose intensification or Q8W for subjects 
requiring dose intensification . 
 
During the  approximately  [ADDRESS_349454] will receive a total 
of either  5 or 6 doses, based on the one group to which they are assigned, as described below .  
Subjects will receive an initial 3 doses of either ABP  654 or ustekinumab at weeks  0, 4, and 16 .  
From week 28 subjects will receive either ABP  654 or ustekinumab  every 8  weeks (Q8W) or 
every 12  weeks (Q12W).  
At week 28, disease assessments will be conducted including the evaluation of PASI.  
Subjects who do not achieve a PASI [ADDRESS_349455] completed the study  and will complete  the end of study procedures (ie, week 
52 procedures)  at week 28.  Those unable to complete week [ADDRESS_349456] a PASI 
assessment completed, will be discontinued from the s tudy (see Week 28 Decision Tree Diagram  
below) . 
Subjects  with a PASI  75 response or better improvement will continue on the study and will be 
re-randomized in a blinded fashion such that subjects initially rand omized to Group A 
(ABP  654) will continue to receive ABP  654 and those in Group B (ustekinumab) will be 
re-randomized 1:1 to either continue on ustekinumab (Treatment Group  B1) or switch to 
ABP  654 (Treatment Group B2).  Subjects will receive investigation al product at week  [ADDRESS_349457] at week  40.

 For subjects with PASI 50 response or better but less than PASI  75 response at week  28, based 
on the Investigator’s discretion, subjects may increase dose frequency to Q8W.  Sub jects with 
baseline BW  100 kg will receive 45  mg Q8W and subjects  100 kg at baseline will receive 
90 mg Q8W at weeks  28, 36, and 44.  These subjects will continue on original assigned 
treatment with dose intensification and will NOT be re -randomized .  Subjects not dose 
intensifying will be re -randomized  as descr ibed above.

Statistical Analysis  
All e fficacy analyses will be conducted in the full analysis set, consisting all randomized 
subjects, according to randomized treatment group.  Sensitivity analyses will be performed for 
the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints  using the per -protoc ol an alysis set . 
Clinical equivalence of the primary endpoint will be evaluated by [CONTACT_17921] 2 -sided 95 % 
confidence interval (CI) of the mean difference of PASI percent improvement from baseline to 
week  12 between ABP  654 versus ustekinumab with equivalence  margin of ( -15, +15).   Clinical 
equivalence of the primary endpoint for Japan will be evaluated by [CONTACT_17921] 2 -sided 
95% CI of the mean difference of PASI percent improvement from baseline to week  12 between 
ABP  654 versus ustekinumab in subjects with  baseline BW ≤ 100 kg (and hence are to receive 
the 45  mg dose) against the ( -15, +15) margin.  
The 95% CI of the difference will be estimated using analysis of covariance model with the 
baseline PASI value and stratifica tion factors as covariates.  The mea n difference of PASI percent 
improvement between the initial randomized groups ( ABP  654 vs ustekinumab) or between the 
re-randomized groups ( ABP  654/ABP  654, ustekinumab/ustekinumab, ustekinumab/ ABP  654) at 
other schedul ed visits, the risk difference of PA SI 75 and 100 response rate throughout the study, 
the risk difference of the percent of subjects with sPGA responses (0/1) at week  12 and week  52, 
and the mean difference in BSA change from baseline at week  12 and week  52 will be 
summarized descriptively.  Separate descriptive summaries by [CONTACT_286631] 
(ABP  654 vs ustekinumab) will be provided for post week  [ADDRESS_349458], based on the actual 
treatment received.  In general, summaries will be provided separately from day 1 (first 
investigational product administration) until week 12, from day 1 until week  28, from week  28 
through the end of the study  (EOS) , and from day 1 through the EOS .  The summaries for day 1 
through week 12 and day 1 through week  28 will be presented by [CONTACT_3148] ( ABP  654 vs 
ustekinumab).  The summaries for week  28 thr ough the EOS  and day 1 through the EOS  will be 
presented by [CONTACT_19016] ( ABP  654/ABP  654, ustekinumab/ustekinumab,

ABP  654 is a biosimilar candidate to Stelara® (ustekinumab) which is an interleuk in (IL) -[ADDRESS_349463] . 
The term “ investigational product ” throughout the protocol, refers to ABP  654 or ustekinumab . 
2.1 Study Rationale  
[COMPANY_010] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_286605]  654 as a biosimilar  candidate  to Stelara® (ustekinumab ).  ABP  654 
and ustekinumab  belong to the pharmacologic class of IL -12 and IL -23 antagonists.  The 
mechanism of action across indications involves the  ustekinumab  protein molecule binding with 
specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by [CONTACT_286633]-12 and IL -23 cytokines .  This binding 
disrupts  IL-12 and IL -23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by [CONTACT_286634] a shared cell -surface receptor chain, IL-12 receptor subunit beta 1 
(IL-12Rβ). 
In the US, ustekinumab is approved for the SC administration in the treatment of moderate to 
severe p laque psoriasis (Ps)  in adults and adolescent subjects (12  years or older), and active 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adults , as well as maintenance d osing for adult patients with moderate 
to severe active Crohn’s disease and moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis; ustekinumab is 
also approved for the intravenous (IV) route of administratio n in the treatment of moderate t o 
severe active Crohn’s Disease (CD)  in adults and moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis in 
adults ( Stelara® [LOCATION_002] Prescribing Information [USP I], March  2020 ).  In the EU, 
ustekinumab is approved for SC administration in the treatment of mod erate to severe Ps in 
adults and adolescent  subjects (6  years or older) and PsA in adults.  In the EU, ustekinumab is 
approved for the treatment of the above indications with the exception that pediatric patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ar e considered for treatment  if 6 years or older  (Stelara® 
Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC], February 2020 ). 
A biosimilar product, generally, is one that is highly similar to a licensed biologic reference 
product, and there are no clinically meaningful differences between th e biosimilar and reference 
products in terms of safety, purity, and potency.  Biosimilarit y is demonstrated by [CONTACT_286635], including quality, nonclinical, and clinical evidence.   The quality and nonclinical 
data for ABP  654 and ustekinuma b are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure .

Final  20 of 84 06 Aug 2020  ABP  654 has the same dosage forms (solution for injection), produ ct strength, and formulation as 
ustekinumab  (US and EU) . 
The totality of evidence available from an ongoing analytical program suggests that ABP  [ADDRESS_349465] to its physicochemical properties and biological 
activi ties, except for minor differences expected from cell line changes; these minor differences 
are not expected to be clinically meaningful .  Both ABP  [ADDRESS_349466] the sam e 
amino acid sequence.  ABP  654 and ustekinumab (US and EU) have similar in vitro binding to 
IL-23, IL -12, and neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (FcRn) , similar inhibition of IL -23 
and IL -12, and similar binding kinetics and affinity to IL -23 and I L-12.  Effector functions 
(ADCC and CDC) towards cells expressing IL -12 and/or IL -23 receptors are not expected to 
occur with ABP  654 and ustekinumab.   The lack of ADCC was confirmed when ABP  654 and 
ustekinumab were tested for effector functions using hum an IL -12 expressing U937 cells.  Lack 
of CDC activity is currently being  investigated.  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  for more information.  
As of the date of this protocol , ABP  654 has not been tested in humans.  This Study  20190232  is 
being  conducted to demonstrate that there is no clinically meaningful difference between 
ABP  654 and ustekinumab in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in adult subjects 
with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis .  Based on the analyti cal similarity of ABP  654 and 
ustekinumab established to date, clinical experience with ustekinumab is deemed relevant to 
predicting the effects of ABP  654 in humans and is summarized in the following paragraphs.   A 
separate  study , Study 20190230 , is being  conducted to evaluate the single dose pharmacokinetics 
(PK), safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ABP  654 (90  mg SC injection) compared to 
ustekinumab (US and EU) in healthy subjects.  
Ustekinumab has been investigated in a number of clini cal trial s and for a number of different 
indications.  In healthy subjects, the median time of maximum concentration (T max) value 
following a single SC administration of 90  mg of ustekinumab was comparable to subjects with 
psoriasis.  The maximum observed concentra tion (C max) and area under the concentration -time 
curve (AUC) in healthy subjects was higher than values seen in subjects with psoriasis.  This is 
likely attributed to differing PK sampling schedules between the 2 studies, differences in BW 
betwee n the 2  populations, or increased IL -12/IL -[ADDRESS_349467] s following a single 90  mg SC dose, the apparent volume of 
distribution was 90.2  mL/kg and the terminal half -life (t1/2) was 2 2.1 day s with an  apparent 
systemic clearance of 3.1  mL/day/kg ( BLA  125261 Clinical Pharmacology and 
Biopharmaceutics Review, 2009 ).

Final  21 of 84 06 Aug 2020  In subjects with plaque psoriasis , exposure  increased in an approximately dose proportional 
manner after a single SC  administration at doses range from 0.27  mg/kg to 2.7  mg/kg.  Serum 
concentrations of ustekinumab were higher in the group receiving the 90  mg dose, as opposed to 
the 45  mg dose.  However, when comparing the difference among  the 2  groups d ose 
proportionali ty was also shown.  Assessment of intrinsic factors including BW, age, and sex were 
performed.  When given the same dose of ustekinumab , subjects  that weighed >  100 kg had 
lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those s ubjects weighing 
 100 kg.  Subgroup analysis showed that age , sex, and race  had no effects on clinical response 
(Stelara USPI,  March  2020; BLA  125261 Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics 
Review, 2009 ). 
The clinical efficacy and safety information for ustekinumab as  described in the product labeling 
for Stelara® (Stelara USPI, March 2020; Stelara® SmPC, Febr uary 2020 ) are considered 
relevant to predicting the effects of ABP  654 in humans.   When ustekinumab was administered 
to subjects with p laque psoriasis in clinical studies, subjects had a reduction  in disease as 
measured by  [CONTACT_286636] ( ≥ 75% improvement  in PASI [ PASI 75 ]) from baseline to week  12 and 
treatment success (cleared or minimal) on the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) as 
compared with the placebo arm.   Adverse events reflected in the warnings and precautions 
section of the p roduct labeling for ustekinumab that may be serious include bacterial, fungal , and  
viral infections including tuberculosis, malignancies, hypersensitivity reactions, reversible 
poster ior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, and noninfectious pneumonia .

4 Study Design  
4.1 Overall  Design  
This is a  randomized, double -blind, active -controlled phase 3 study  in adult subjects with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.   This study is planned to be conducted globally at sites in 
North America  and Europe.  
Approximately  542 adult subjects  will be randomized (approximately 271 in the ABP  654 group 
and approximately 271 in the ustekinumab group ).  See Section  8.3 for sample size 
deter mination.   Randomi zation will be stratified based on prior biologic use for psoriasis (yes 
versus [vs] no  (no more than 50% of the total randomized subjects  will have prior biologic use

randomized (1:1) to Treatment Group A (ABP  654) or Treatment Group B (ustekinumab).   
Subjects will receive ABP  654 or ustekinumab at  a dose of 45  mg (baseline BW  ≤ 100 kg) or 
90 mg (baseline  BW > 100 kg) administered SC on day 1 (week  0), week  4, and week  16.  The 
primary endpoint (PASI percent improvement from baseline to week  12) will be evaluated at 
week  12. 
At week  28, subjects who do not  achieve a PASI [ADDRESS_349471] completed the study  and will complete end of study procedures (ie, week 52 
procedures) , and those unable t o complete the week  [ADDRESS_349472] a PASI assessment 
completed , will be discontinued from the study  (see Figure  4-1). 
Subjects with a PASI  75 response or better improvement will continue on the study and will be 
re-randomized in a  blinded fashion such that subjects initially randomized to Group A (ABP  654) 
will continue to receive ABP  654 and  those in Group B (ustekinumab) will re -randomized , using 
the same stratification factors as the original randomization , 1:1 to either continue on 
ustekinumab (Treatment Group B1)  or switch to ABP  654 (Treatment Group B2).   Subjects will 
receive  investigat ional product at week  [ADDRESS_349473] at 
week  40. 
For subjects with PASI 50 response or better but less  than PASI 75 response at week  28, based 
on the Investigator’s discretion, the dose frequency may be increase d to Q8W.   Subjects  with 
baseline  BW ≤ 100 kg will receive 45  mg Q8W and subjects >  100 kg at baseline will receive 
90 mg Q8W at weeks  28, 36, and 44.  These subjects will continue on the originally assigned 
treatment with dose intensification and will not be re -randomized.   Subjects that do  not dose 
intensify  will be re -randomized.

5.[ADDRESS_349487] Enrollment  
Before subjects begin participation i n any study -specific activities/p rocedures, [COMPANY_010] requires a 
copy of the site’s written IRB/IEC approval of the protocol, informed consent form ( ICF), and all 
other subject information and/or recruitment material.  
The subject must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_010] approved IC F before 
commencement of study -specific procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled when the Investigator decides that the subject has met all 
eligibility criteria and has been randomized in the Interactive Web/Voice Respo nse System 
(IXRS).  The Investiga tor is to document this eligibility decision and date in the subject’s 
medical record.  
Each subject will have a unique subject identification number obtained from the IXRS.  This will 
be assigned at the screening visit.  The unique [ADDRESS_349488] identif ication will be assigned in 
sequential order for each site in the format “ 232XXXXX###,” where “ 232XXXXX” refers to the 
site number and “###” refers to the sequential subject ordering as each subject at a site is entered 
into the IXRS ( eg, 23212345001).  This number will be used to identify the subject throughout 
the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  The 
Investigator will keep a record (the subject screening log) that include s limited information (such 
as da te of screening) about the potential candidates for subjects who entered screening.  
If a subject withdraws from study participation, his/her unique identification number(s) cannot 
be re -used for another subject.  
The subject  identification number must remai n constant throughout the entire clinical study; it 
must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened.  This number 
will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number assigned for the study.

5.5 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as subjects  who consent to participate in t he clinical study  but are not 
subsequently  randomly assigned to study intervention.  A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects  to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from regulatory authoritie s.  Minimal information includes demography, 
reason for screen failure (eg, eligibility requirements failed),  and any SAE s. 
If a subject has not met all eligibility criter ia at the end of the screening period, the subject will 
be registered as a screen fai l.  Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this 
study (screen failure)  may be re screene d.  Rescreened subjects  should be assigned the same 
subject i dentification number as for the initial screening.   Laboratory assessments used to 
determine subject eligibility may be repeated during the screening period before the subject is 
considered a screen failure.  Screen failed subjects may be rescreened up to 2 times at the 
Investigator ’s discretion (ie, a tot al of 3 screens including initial screening).   If screening 
procedures cannot be completed within [ADDRESS_349490]  or Procedures  
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving investigational 
product or procedures at any time during the study but continue participation in the study.  If this 
occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from investigational product and must discuss with the subject the possibilities 
for continuation of the  SoA (Section  1.3) including different options of follow -up (eg, in person, 
by [CONTACT_648]/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other treati ng 
physicians, from the review of medical record s) and collection of data, including AEs, and must 
document this decision in the subject’s medical records.  Subjects who have discontinued

subjects remain on study to ensure safety surveillance and/or collection of efficacy data, where 
possible.   Reasons for early removal f rom protocol -required investigational product(s)  or 
procedural assessments may include:  
• Decision by [CONTACT_3211]  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Death  
• Adverse event  
• Subject request  
• Protocol deviation  
• Noncompliance  
• Pregnancy  
5.6.2 Withdrawal /Discontinuation of Subjects from the Study  
Participation in the study is strictly volunt ary.  Subjects have the right to withdraw from the 
study  by [CONTACT_5657]/her own request at any time and for any reason without any reprisal, and without 
prejudice to future medical care by [CONTACT_286638].

Subjects terminating early from the study should complete all procedures scheduled for week  52 
within 28 days after withdrawal/discontinuati on if possible.  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882], and the subject does not wish to or is unable to 
continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publicly available data ca n be included after 
withdrawal of consent.  The Investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for 
withdrawal from the s tudy, and must document the subject’s decision to withdraw in the 
subject’s medical records.   If the subject withdra ws consent for disclosure of future information, 
the sponsor  may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of 
consent.   If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the study center study records 
and notify the sponsor  or designee.   Although a subject is not obl iged to give his/her reason(s) 
for withdrawing prematurely from a study, the Investigator should make a reasonable e ffort to 
ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject's rights.   Subjects who are withdrawn 
will not be replaced.   Subjects w ho prematurely discontinue from the study cannot subsequently 
rejoin the study.  
A subject may be discontinued from t he study at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for 
safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons, including, but not limited to : 
• Requirement for alternative therapy or alternative dosing schedule per the Investigator’s 
determination  
• The subject  develops a malignancy. (Exception: Subjects may be allowed to continue if 
they develop no more than 2 non -melanoma skin cancers during the study)  
• AEs or SAEs  
• Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the Investigator , taking into

The study is double -blinded ; therefore, the Investigators, study personnel  with the exception of 
the Parexel unblinded biostatistician  and unblinded programmers ; and the DMC , and the study 
subjects will remain blinded  to treatment allocation.  
Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized staff  and the 
DMC  until the time of unblinding .  Authorized staff includes the randomization statistician, who 
will store the master randomization list in a secure system,  an unblinded statistician, and 
unblinded programmers, who will provide the DMC with unbli nded data for review, as and when 
required, in accordance with the procedures described in the DMC Charter.   All authorized 
unblinded staff must be documented.   Perso nnel unblinded for the primary analysis will not be 
subsequently involved in study managem ent.

7.5 Adverse Events  
7.5.1 Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Even ts 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  The event does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational product.  An AE can therefore be 
an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnor mal laborato ry finding), symptom, or 
disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination 
product, medical device, or procedure.   The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that any AEs 
observed by [CONTACT_286660]’s medical 
record as well as the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
Events that meet the AE definition are as follows:  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or 
other safety assessments ( eg, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline, that are considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment 
of the Investigator ( ie, not related to progression of  underlying disease)  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
• New conditions , including signs and symptoms,  detected or diagnosed after study 
treatment admi nistration e ven though it may have been present before the start of the 
study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction

Sponsor [COMPANY_010], Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
20190232  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final  50 of 84 06 Aug 2020  • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant me dication.  Overdose associated with any clinical sequelae 
will be considered  an AE and reported as an AE/SAE  unless it is an intentional overdose  
taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  Such overdoses are to be reported 
regardless of sequelae.   In case of overdosage, it is recommended that the subject be 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate 
symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately  
• “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological acti on” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE .  Such instances will be capt ured in the efficacy assessments.   
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported as AE or SAE  if they fulfill the definit ion of an AE or SAE  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
Events no t meeting the AE definition include:  
• Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy):  the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE 
• Situations in which an untow ard medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  [inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164921] 24  hours]) 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of t he study that do not worsen  
• A pre -existing condition that has no t worsened during the study or involves an 
intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study is 
not considered an AE 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE  is defined  as any untoward medical occurrence that meets at least 1 of the  following 
serious criteria:  
• Results in death (fatal)  
• Life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8686]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect

Final  51 of 84 06 Aug 2020  • Other medically important serious event  
Definition of Terms  
Life-threatening:   The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “seriousness” refers to an even t 
in which the subject was at risk of death  at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  For example, 
drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failu re would not be considered 
life-threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis can be fatal.  It does not include an AE or 
suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:   In general, hospit alization signifies that the sub ject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting.  
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_286614].  If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to 
whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10912] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE. 
Disability/incapacity:   The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct n ormal life functions.  This defi nition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere wit h or prevent 
everyday life funct ions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Other medically important serious event:   Medical or scientific judgment is to be exercised in 
deciding whether SAE  reporting is appropriate in other situations such as im portant medical 
events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155968] 1 of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition.  The se events are typi[INVESTIGATOR_286615].  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], or development of drug de pendency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing all laboratory test results, including review of 
laboratory test results prior to subject  randomization and reviewing sub sequent laboratory test 
[COMPANY_010] Proprietary  - Confidential  
Sponsor [COMPANY_010], Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
[ADDRESS_349514]’s baseline 
values.  Laboratory abnormalities without  clinical significance (based on the Investigator's 
judgment) should not be recorded as AEs or SAE s.  However, laboratory abnormalities ( eg, 
clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis abnormalities) that require medical or surgical 
intervention or lead to investigational product interruption, modification, or discontinuation must 
be recorded as an AE or SAE , as applicable.  Where applicab le, clinical sequelae (not the 
laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the AE.  In addition, laboratory or other abnormal 
assessments ( eg, vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as 
an AE or SAE  if they meet the d efinition of an AE or SAE  as described in Section  7.5.[ADDRESS_349515] the syndrome or diagnosis ( eg, anemia), not 
the laboratory result ( eg, decreased hemoglobin).  
7.5.2 Assessment of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of sev erity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study.  The assessment of severity will be based on  CTCAE  version 4.03: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/elect ronic_applications/ctc.htm  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Causality  
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between i nvestigational product and each 
occurrence of each AE or SAE . 
Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship between 
invest igational product and the event.  
The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationsh ip. 
Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as 
well as the temporal relationship of the event to  study treatment administration will be 
considered and investigated.  
The Investigator will also consult the IB in his/her assessment.  
For each AE or SAE , the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE or SAE  and has pro vided an assessment of causality.

Sponsor [COMPANY_010], Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
20190232  CONFIDENTIAL  
Final  53 of 84 06 Aug 2020  There may be situations in which a SAE  has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report.  However, it is very important that the Investigator 
always make an assessment of causality  for every event before the initial transmission of the 
SAE  data.  
The Investigator may change hi s/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and 
send a SAE  follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
7.5.[ADDRESS_349516]’s medical records as well as  the applicable CRF Adverse Event Summary page.  The AE 
grading scale to be used for this study will be CTCAE version 4.03,  as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
The Investigator must assign the following AE attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms)  
• Dates of onset and  resolution  
• Severity (National Cancer Institute CTCAE  versio n 4.03)  
• Assessment of relatedness to investigational product, other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_286616]  
• Action  taken  
The Investigator must assess whether the AE is possibly related to the investigational product.   
This relationship is indicated by a “ye s” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_286661]?” The Investigator 
is responsible for reviewing labo ratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in 
an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline 
values.  In general, ab normal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the 
Investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as AEs.  Howeve r, laboratory value changes that 
require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered AEs.  Where applicable,  
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the AE.

Final  54 of 84 06 Aug 2020  The Investigator’s clinical judgment is used to dete rmine whether a subject is to be removed 
from treatment due to an AE.  A subject, or subject’s legal representative , can a lso voluntarily 
withdraw from treatment due to an AE.  If the subject withdraws consent, the subject is 
encouraged to undergo, at a mi nimum, an EOS assessment.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all documentation ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], laboratory 
reports, and diagnostic reports) related to an AE.  Wherever possible, the Investigator’s 
diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, will be documented as the AE. 
It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photoco pi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical records to 
sponsor or responsible CRO in lieu of completion of the CRF page.  
If specifically requested, the Investigator may need  to provide additional follow -up information, 
such as discharge summaries, medical records, or ex tracts from the medical records.  In this case, 
all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be blinded  on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_286617].  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAE s after the subject’s conclusion of 
study participation.  However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE , including death, at any time 
after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonab ly related to the investigational product or study participation, the Investigator must 
promptly notify the sponsor . 
7.5.[ADDRESS_349517] be collec ted, recorded and transmitted to [COMPANY_010], or its designee, within 24  hours 
following the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
The Investigator will submit any updated SAE  data to the sponsor  or designee within 24 hours of 
it being available.  
The criteria for grade 4 in the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for 
SAE s.  It is left to the Investigator’s judgment to report these grade 4 abnorma lities as SAE s.

After the study is completed at a given center, the EDC system will be taken off -line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  If a center receives a report of a new SAE

been taken off -line, th en the center can report this information on a paper Serious Adverse Event 
Form.

Prompt notification by [CONTACT_286664]  (or designee) of SAE s is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a 
study treatment under c linical investigation are met.  
The sponsor  (or designee) has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatm ent under clinical investigation.  
The sponsor  (or designee) w ill comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to 
safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs, and Investigators.  
Individual safety reports must be prepared for su spected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
according to loca l regulatory requirements and sponsor  (or designee) policy and forwarded to 
Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an individual safety report describing a SAE  or other specifi c 
safety information ( eg, summary or listing of SAE s) from the  sponsor  (or designee) will file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.

7.5.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Event After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subj ects for SAE s following the protocol -required 
reporting period  or after the EOS .  However, these SAE s can be reported to [COMPANY_010].  Per local 
requirements in some countries, Investigators are required to report SAE s that they become 
aware of after the EOS .  If SAE s are reported, the Investigator is to report them to Amg en within 
24 hours following the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
Serious adverse events  reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety datab ase as clinical study cases and handled accordingly based on 
relationship to investigational product.  
7.5.7 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAE s.  Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred met hod to inquire about AE 
occurrence.  
7.5.8 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow -up 
During the study the AEs and SAE s should be followed proactively by [CONTACT_286667]/contact.  All AEs and SAE s will be followed until resolution, st abilization, 
until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  At the time the

Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biom edical Journals International 
committee of Medical Journal Editor s’ Recommendations for the Conduct of Reporting, Editing, 
and Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which states:  Authorship credit is to be 
based on:  (1) substantial contribu tions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis 
and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual 
content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; and (4) agreement to be a ccountable

part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors need to meet conditions 1, 
2, 3, and 4.  
When a large, multicenter group has  conducted the work, the group is to identify the individuals 
who acc ept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals must fully meet the 
criteria for authorship defined above.  Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general 
supervi sion of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship.  All persons designated as 
authors must qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify are to be listed.  Each author must 
have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsi bility for appropriate portions of 
the content.  All publications (eg , manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters)

[IP_ADDRESS]  Protocol Adherence and Deviations  
The Investigator and site personnel should conduct the study in compliance with the protocol and 
should use continuous vigilance to identify and report protocol deviations.  
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the st udy design or procedures 
defined in t he protocol that may be on the part of the Investigator, site personnel, or the subject.  
Important protocol deviations are a subset of protocol deviations that may significantly impact 
the completeness, accuracy, and/or  reliability of the study data or tha t may significantly affect a 
subject ’s rights, safety, or well -being.  For example, important protocol deviations may include 
randomizing  subjects in violation of key eligibility criteria designed to ensure a specific s ubject 
population or failing to colle ct data necessary to interpret primary endpoints, as this may 
compromise the scientific value of the study.

Information  
Study -specific contraception requirements for male s and female s of childbearing potential are 
outlined in Section 5.2. 
Male and female subjects of childbearing potent ial must receive pregnancy prevention 
counseling and be advised of the risk to the fetus if they become pregnant or father a child during 
treatment and for [ADDRESS_349539] dose of protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Additional medications given during the  study may alter the contraceptive requirements.  These 
additional medications may require female subjects to use highly effective methods of 
contraception and/or for an increased length of time.  In addition, male su bjects may also be 
required to use cont raception.  The Investigator must discuss these contraceptive changes with 
the subject.  
Definition  of Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (se e below).  
If fertility is unclear ( eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the  following categories  are not considere d WOCBP:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with one of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
NOTE: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s  review of the subject ’s medical 
record s, medical examination, or medical history interview.

may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT).  However, in the 
absence of 12  month s of amenorrhea, a single FSH m easurement  (> 40 IU/L 
or mIU/mL ) is required . 
• Females on HRT  and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study.  Other wise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of post -menopausal status before study randomization .

abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of th e study and the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject)  
• Use a condom during treatment and for an additional [ADDRESS_349541] dose of IP 
• The female partner should consider using an acceptable method of effective contraception 
such as: hormonal, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormonal -releasing system, female 
barrier method (diaphragm, cap, sponge [a female condom is not an option because there 
is a risk of tearing when both partners use a condom])  
• Note:  If the male’s sole female par tner is of nonchildbearing potential or has had a 
bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, he is not required to use additional forms of 
contraceptio n during the study  
Contraceptive Guidance for Female Subjects:  
Female subject s of childbearing potential are eli gible to participate if they agree to use a highly 
effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in the table below  and 
described in Section  5.2.

• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized Partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed.   If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
Sexual Abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is  considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the durati on of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject .

• WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and  a negative  
highly sensitive serum  pregnancy test . 
• Additional pregnancy testing  should be performed at intervals  during the intervention  
period per the S oA and at  the EOS , and as required locally.  
• Pregnancy testing  will be performed whenever a menstrual cy cle is missed or when 
pregnancy is  otherwise suspected.

within 24 hours of the center’s awarene ss of the pregnancy.  (Note: Sites are not required 
to provide any information on the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country 
or regions local privacy laws).  
• The Investigator will attempt to obtai n a signed authorization for release of pregna ncy and 
infant health information directly from the pregnant female partner to obtain additional 
pregnancy information.  
• After obtaining the female partner’s signed authorization for release of pregnancy and 
infant health information, the Investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and infant 
health information on the pregnant partner and her baby [CONTACT_237086].  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] or its designee.  
• Generally, i nfant follow -up will be conducted up to 12  months after the birth of the child 
(if applicable).  
• Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] or its designee regardless of 
fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for proce dure.

pregnant while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] [ADDRESS_349545] . 
• Information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Form .  The form must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010] or its designee within [ADDRESS_349546]’s pregnancy.   
(Note: Sites are not required to provide any information on the Pregnancy Notification 
Form that violates the country or regions local privacy  laws). 
• After obtaining the female subject’s signed authorization for release of pregnancy and 
infant health information, the Investigator will collect pregnancy and infant health 
information and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject who 
becomes pregnant while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] [ADDRESS_349547] 
dose of IP.  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] or its designee.  Generally, 
infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12  month s after the birth of the ch ild 
(if applicable).  
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] or its designee, regardless of 
fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE , any pregnan cy complication 
or report of a congenital anomaly or developmental delay, fetal death, or suspected 
adverse reactions in the neonate will be reported as an AE or SAE .  Note that an elective 
termination with no information on a fetal congenital malformation  or maternal 
complication is generally not considered an AE, but still must be reported to [COMPANY_010] or its 
designee as a pregnancy exposure case.  
• If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a SAE  
(eg, female subject experienc es a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death or 
there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the Investigator will report t he event as a 
SAE . 
• Any SAE  occurring as a result of a poststudy pregnancy which is considered reasonably 
related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_737], will be reported to [COMPANY_010] or its 
designee.  While the Investigator is not obligated to actively see k this information in 
form er study subjects, he or she may learn of a SAE  through spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating will discontinue study 
treatment.

[ADDRESS_752809]  Protocol Narrative      v. 8 02/15/19 
Implementation of Strength at Home for Military Couples  
(1) Rationale  
(a) Statement of the Problem .  
Approximately 4.[ADDRESS_752810] likely assailant of a victim of violence is his or her relationship partner,2 and IPA 
victimization is associated with poorer physical and psychological health.3-8 Physical health problems range 
from injuries or conditions  directly caused by [CONTACT_573440], to other chronic nervous system, 
musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and urogenital symptoms and conditions.9,10 Psychological 
and emotional problems often include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), d epression, anxiety, insomnia, 
substance abuse, and social difficulties.7,9,[ADDRESS_752811] worker productivity.14 
IPA prevalence rates in military samples vary widely, with rates ranging from 13.5% to 58%.[ADDRESS_752812] workdays.18-22 
Among active military, family problems are more powerful predictors of military morale, motivation, readiness, 
and retention than resource variables, unit -related factors, and work conditions.20,23 -25 Service members 
experiencing intimate relationship probl ems are also more likely to exhibit concentration problems and deficits 
in cognitive acuity that may compromise mission safety and job performance.26 
(b) Hypotheses or Key Question .  
A Hybrid Type -I Implementation -effectiveness research design will allow t he research team, comprising 
investigators with expertise in intervention  development, efficacy and effectiveness research, and 
implementation science, to simultaneously investigate the effectiveness of SAH-C in a military population while 
identifying any barriers to implementation that would need to be addressed before SAH-C could be successfully 
implemented on a larger scale. The study site for this proposed effort is Joint Base Lewis McChord, 
Washington.  
The primary hypotheses are that those receiving SAH-C will evidence greater reductions in physical and 
psychological IPV, and greater increases in relationship satisfaction, relative to those receiving Supportive 
Prevention  across the follow up time points.  
(c) Specific Objectives .  
AIM 1:  To test the e ffectiveness of SAH-C for military couples on an installation, we will conduct a 
randomized trial comparing 10 sessions of SAH-C to 10 sessions of Supportive Prevention  (SP) under 
representative conditions, with 140 couples who are at risk for the development of IPA  (risk is established if at 
least one member of the couple reports at or below a score of 100 on the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), a 
cutoff score used to distinguish relationship distress, or they report the presence of psychological agg ression in 
the past three months) . This aim will be fulfilled by [CONTACT_573441]:  
2 
  
Subaim 1.1: To compare the frequency of physical IPA perpetration of both members of the couple across 
conditions as reported by [CONTACT_573442] r collateral relationship partners at post -intervention and two 
3-month follow ups.   
Subaim 1.2:  To compare the frequency of psychological IPA perpetration of both members of the couple across 
conditions as reported by [CONTACT_573443] -intervention and two 
3-month follow ups.  
Subaim 1.3: To compare relationship satisfaction across conditions as reported by [CONTACT_573444] -intervention and two 3 -month follo w ups.  
AIM 2:  To explore differences in compliance factors across conditions, we will compare session attendance.  
AIM 3:  To facilitate future implementation of SAH-C, we will employ a mixed -methods approach, guided by 
[CONTACT_573445] s, to examine potential barriers, facilitators, and potential for 
intervention refinement. This aim will be fulfilled by [CONTACT_573441]:  
Subaim 3. 1: To identify system, facilitator , and dyadic -level barriers and facilitators to impleme ntation.  
Subaim 3. 2: To assess the acceptability of SAH-C among stakeholders in a military setting.  
(2) Background and Significance  
(a) Background .  
 
Only one experimentally controlled evaluation of IPA intervention effectiveness has been conducted in a 
military setting. Among a large sample of married Navy couples in which the husband used IPA, Dunford27 
found that none of the randomly assigned year -long intervention modalities were effective in reducing IPA at 
six and [ADDRESS_752813]’s27 findings highlighted a need for program modification efforts 
to meet the needs of military families and also mirrored findings of a lack of program efficacy in civilian 
settings.[ADDRESS_752814] on one’s ability to interpret and respond to social situations effectively, and highlights the 
importance of cognitive behavioral  strategies to monitor one’s thoughts and responses to difficult interpersonal 
situations. 32 The model derives from prior theory33,34 and research indicating that those who use IPA are more 
likely to exhibit irrational beliefs, problematic thinking, and h ostile interpretations of others’ intentions.35-[ADDRESS_752815] difficulties are also addressed throughout the program.  
 
(b) Significance .  
There is currently no empi[INVESTIGATOR_573423]. The 
proposed research to utilize the SAH-C intervention, that has been shown to be efficacious in VA and 
community settings, is innovative in its applic ation to target this problem in this unique context. Moreover, 
SAH-C in itself is novel in its integration of interventions focused on trauma, IPA, and couples -based 
[ADDRESS_752816] systemically to facilitate translation from 
science to practice.50  
One strategy to bridge the implementation gap is to capi[INVESTIGATOR_573424]’ and stakeholders’ 
knowledge to ensure fit between the intervention training, provider needs, and organiz ational context. Recently 
described by [CONTACT_573446],[ADDRESS_752817] on findings to enhance the effectiveness or fit of SAH-C in military settings if 
needed, and to roll the intervention out more broadly if our findings warrant doing so.  
(c) Outline of SAH-C 
 
SAH-C derives from a unique fusion of interventions for trauma and IPA, integrating elements of cognitive 
processing therapy for PTSD,[ADDRESS_752818] with the consolidation of material. A group couples format is used because group cohesion among 
clients appears to be associated with IPA prevention.43 Group interventions also use less time and resources 
than indivi dual-based interventions.  In this psychoeducation intervention, the couples participating in the 
program are the learners.  What follows is a brief outline of each of the 10 SAH-C sessions.  
 
Session 1: Introduction and Welcoming  
 
This session introduces couples to the structure, expectations, and philosophy of the group. The main tasks 
are to begin establishing an alliance with each couple, to validate and address concerns, and to encourage 
healthy group interactions. Group leaders  teach participants the skill of paraphrasing , the foundation of active 
listening. Leaders will refer to this skill and encourage participants to use it throughout the program.  
 
Session 2: Trauma  and Relationships I     
 
Group members explore their beliefs about healthy and unhealthy relationships and review assignments 
designed to enhance intimacy and solidify mutual  intervention  goals. The session then shifts to discussing 
psychoeducational material that focuses on understanding forms of IPA and th e impact of trauma on couples’ 
4 
 functioning. The main tasks of the session are to enhance motivation, educate group members about abuse and 
trauma, and help members gain insight into the effects of trauma on their own relationship.  
 
Session 3: Trauma and R elationships II  
 
This session begins with a discussion of the practice assignment focusing on understanding how trauma has 
affected the couples’ relationship. The discussion shifts to themes related to trauma that can affect relationships, 
including trust,  power and control, self -esteem, and intimacy. Group material facilitates further contemplation 
of behavior change and  intervention  goals, building upon psychoeducational material from Session 2.  
 
Session 4: Conflict Management I: Assertiveness  
 
This session focuses on conflict management and expressing anger assertively, with some material focused 
on how conflict management styles were learned in the military and elsewhere. The goals of this session are to 
further facilitate an und erstanding of the impact of trauma on relationships, and to help couples identify positive 
(i.e., assertive) versus harmful (i.e., aggressive, passive) communication styles during conflict.  
 
Session 5: Conflict Management II: Time Outs  
 
Group members revi ew the self -monitoring assignment designed to assess group members’ assertive, 
passive, and aggressive responses to conflict situations. Discussion then focuses on developi[INVESTIGATOR_573425]. Couples are asked to generate and p ut into practice a detailed “Time Out Plan” to 
use during conflict situations. Development of these plans is an important crisis management tool to ensure 
safety for the couple, and provides a skill that helps to lay the groundwork for future work on commu nication.  
 
Session 6: Communication Skills I: Active Listening  
  
After discussing Time Outs and self -monitoring practice assignments, good and bad communication is 
discussed. Listening skills are emphasized since they are the foundation of good communicat ion, de -escalating 
conflict, and enhancing intimacy. Listening is particularly important when trauma symptoms are present 
because information processing abilities are often compromised by [CONTACT_573447].  
 
Session 7: Communication Skills II: Assertive Messages  
 
After reviewing group members’ communication self -monitoring forms, group discussion focuses on how to 
give an assertive message. G roup members are introduced to a role play depi[INVESTIGATOR_573426]. The continued focus on enhanced communication skills is intended 
to reduce the negative impact that deployments and trauma may have on communication, and to further enhance 
intimacy, improve rel ationship problem solving, and facilitate the sharing of trauma -related material.  
 
Session 8: Communication Skills III: Expressing Feelings  
 
Group members review their communication self -monitoring forms and the assertive messages and active 
listening practice assignment and then discuss how trauma -related avoidance can lead to difficulties in 
expressing emotions. Strategies for expressing feel ings are provided and couples practice these skills during the 
session. Emotional expression skills are important for enhancing intimacy and understanding among couples.  
 
Session 9: Communication Skills IV: Common Communication Traps  
 
5 
 Group material focus es on five communication traps that undermine assertive communication. These traps 
are particularly important for those experiencing deployments and trauma. Strategies to avoid these common 
communication traps and to cope productively when they arise are i ntroduced and discussed.  
 
Session 10: Reviewing Gains and Planning for Future  
 
Group members explore gains made in the group. They identify goals and strategies for future change along 
with barriers to change and strategies to overcome these barriers. Much of the session is spent discussing 
thoughts and feelings about the group endin g, exploring plans for future change, and saying goodbye.  
(d) Relevance to Veterans Health .  
There is currently no empi[INVESTIGATOR_573423]. The 
proposed research to utilize the SAH-C intervention, t hat has been shown to be efficacious in VA and 
community settings, is innovative in its application to target this problem in this unique context. Moreover, 
SAH-C in itself is novel in its integration of interventions focused on trauma, IPA, and couples -based 
intervention  approaches, as well as its focus on prevention of IPA rather than attempting to manage the 
repercussions of IPA once it is already ongoing. Clear ly, since IPA is difficult to stop and manage once the 
cycle of violence begins, a focus on prevention is timely and much needed.  
(3) Work Accomplished  
(a) Preliminary Studies  
 
SAH-C Pi[INVESTIGATOR_573427] [ADDRESS_752819] Tactics Scales (CTS2).44 Results, published in the journal Partner Abuse: New Directions 
in Research, Intervention, and Policy  sugg est the effectiveness of SAH-C in reducing IPA.[ADDRESS_752820] recently examined the data from 78 returning male Veterans and their partners via Phase 2 of the 
CDC trial, with impressive results obtained. The mean incidents of Veteran and partner perpetrated 
psychological IPA, based on CTS2 and Multidimensional Measure of Emotional Abuse45 reports, are presented 
in Table 1. Analyses of Covariance (ANCOVA) at [ADDRESS_752821] -intervention  (controlling for baseline scores) 
revealed a significant effect of group whereby [CONTACT_573448]-C 
couples than SP couples, F(1,46) = 6.37, p = .015 (Figure 1). For partner perpetrated psychological IPA, an 
ANCOVA demonstrated a significant effect of group with SAH-C couples reportin g a significant decrease in 
partner -perpetrated psychological IPA at 6 month follow -up compared to SP couples, F (1,46)= 7.64, p = .008 
(Figure 2). MMEA results for Veteran and partner -perpetrated psychological IPA can be found in Figures 3 and 
4, respecti vely. While based on the MMEA there was no difference in male Veteran -perpetrated psychological 
6 
 IPA at 6 -month follow -up for either the SAH-C or SP conditions, there was a trend -level reduction in partner -
perpetrated IPA at the 6 -month follow -up for SAH-C couples, F(1,46)=3.822, p= .057.  
 
 
The mean incidents of Veteran and partner perpetrated physical IPA are reported in Table 1. There was no 
significant effect of group type on physical IPA perpetration by [CONTACT_573449] ( p-values >.05; see 
Figures 5 and 6, respectively). As physical IPA was an exclusion criterion for the Veterans this study, we did 
not expect a significant decrease in this measure as a function of group. For both the SAH-C and SP groups, 
physical IPA did no t significantly increase at [ADDRESS_752822] 
an interaction whereby [CONTACT_573450]-C group reported a decrease in partner perpetrated physical IPA, while 
those in the SP group reported an increase. Furthermor e we see a greater (albeit non -significant) increase in 
Veteran -perpetrated physical IPA (Figure 6).

We also examined Veterans’ and their loved ones’ perceived relationship quality and mental health 
(depressive and PTSD symptoms) as secondary outcomes of the SAH-C intervention. Descriptive statistics and 
effect sizes representing intraindividual changes for these outcomes are also presented in Table 2. Loved ones 
reported a significant improvement from pre -intervention  to program completion in relationship adjustme nt, as 
measured by [CONTACT_573451].47 Veterans and their loved ones also reported significant decreases 
in depressive and PTSD symptoms from pre -intervention  to program completion, and the PTSD symptom 
improvements were maintained at follow -up.

(4) Work Proposed   
(a) Timeline of Proposed Research  
Figure [ADDRESS_752826] yet complementary implementation 
frameworks to guide an implementation process, understand potential influences on implementation, and  guide 
assessment of key implementation outcomes: 1) Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework;51-54 2) 
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR);55 and 3) the Proctor et al. taxonomy for 
implementation outcome variables.56 
As illustrated in Figure 7, the  implementation process  of the current study will use the REP framework.51,52 
Based on social learning theory57 and Diffusion of Innovations,58 REP focuses on identifying and addressing 
barriers to implementation among stakehold ers, facilitators , and group participants  in order to prepare 
interventions for implementation. REP attends to factors including packaging, training, and ongoing technical 
assistance. The stages of REP are conceptually separate, though sometimes chronologi cally overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007],52,59 
allowing for formative, iterative research. This study will include activities recommended for the Pre -
Conditions and Pre -Implementation phases. The potential influences on implementation  that will be examined 
in each of the REP sta ges are theoretically driven by [CONTACT_524958]55,60 and are described in Figure 7. The CFIR55 is 
a “meta -theoretical” implementation framework generated specifically for research in health care that draws 
upon 19 different implementation models to create a typol ogy of constructs to guide different phases of 
implementation studies. As such, specific CFIR variables will be studied at each of the REP stages, and findings 
will be used to guide future implementation efforts. Finally, the implementation outcome variabl es are based on 
Proctor et al.’s identification of implementation outcomes.[ADDRESS_752827] will be carried out in two phases (Figure 8). Phase 1 (Pre -Conditions) will be conducted during 
the first ten months. Throughout this phase, the intervention  manual, already developed via our prior studies 
with Veterans, will be reviewed and r efined for use on a military base.

An electronic data collection tool , REDCap,  will be utilize d to collect self -report data. REDCap is a secure 
and widely used web application for collecting, managing online data. REDCap is designed to support data 
capture for research studies. This system provides and intuitive interface for users to enter data, and all 
information transmission is encrypted, and the data are stored on a protected network. All access to data is 
restricted on a role -specific basis. The REDCap system was specifically developed around HIPAA Security 
guidelines , and meets DoD information security standards . The REDCap  system provides a  number of 
advantages over traditional data collection methods. Participants are offered a higher level of privacy and 
convenience, which minimize s the likelihood that they will be observed or overheard and allows for 
confidential IPA assessments to be con ducted in the military context. Participants are asked to enter responses 
using a n electronic tablet  and no verbalizations are required. The elimination of written data insures that 
information cannot be discovered or surreptitiously read by [CONTACT_2312].  
Using  the REDCap  system, questions are presented in a standardized form that does not vary from 
participant to participant, thereby [CONTACT_573453]. Further, the hardware records data directly into a data base, eliminating data entry labor and errors.

Abuse  (MMEA)80, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS)69, an 
ongoing intervention  questionnaire, and a Post -intervention 
Satisfaction assessment.  
During baseline assessment, the demographics 
questionnaire, partner contact [CONTACT_982], CTS -2 (time one ), DAS, 
MMEA, PCL, AUDIT, ongoing intervention assessment,  the 
suicidality measure , and CTQ will be given to the 
participants. At the post -intervention assessment, the partner 
contact [CONTACT_982], CTS -[ADDRESS_752832] following an  extremely stressful 
experience81. 
The AUDIT is  a widely used screening tool  to assess 
alcohol consumption and alcohol -related behaviors  
developed by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO)82. 
The CTQ  is a self -report measure reflecting on childhood abuse and neglect. The five subscales include 
emotional, physical, and sexual abuse as well as emotional and physical neglect  (Emotional, Physical, and 
Sexual) and two assessing neglect (Emotional and Physical)83. 
The ongoing intervention  questionnaire has been adapted from the [LOCATION_002] Army Medical Command 
(MEDCOM) behavioral health intake form. The two questions asked request participants to explain the types of 
services they currently receive ( i.e., alcohol and drug, community behav ioral health, chaplains, etc.) and the 
type of therapy they are attending (i.e., individual, couples, family, or group).  
The suicidality measure  is comprised of i tems from other scales. Items 1-4 are from the Depression 
Symptom Index -Suicidality Subscale b y Metalsky & Joiner84, 1997;  5-6 created by [CONTACT_573454] , 7-8 
from the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation  by [CONTACT_152654] & Steer, 199185, 9-11 from the Beck Hopelessness Scale  by 
[CONTACT_152654], Weissman, Lester, & Trexler, 197286, and 12-[ADDRESS_752833] suicide risk assessment, wish to live/die, and feelings of belongingness within relationsh ips. This 
suicide assessment was recommended by [CONTACT_573455], is currently being 
used within DoD, and derives from 5 different validated assessments.  Figure 9.  
*The N here is for the entire sample; we expect that 
20% will not be eligible for payment due to active 
military status.  
 
[ADDRESS_752834] validity.44,66 The measure assesses physical, psychological, and sexual aggression in 
intimate relationships.  Respondents report on the frequency of each item for themselves and their partners. 
Combined partner reports are used to reduce IPA underreporting .  
Because the CTS -2 assesses a fairly limited number of psychologically abusive behaviors, t he 
Multidimensional Measure of Emotional Abuse ( MMEA ) will also be administered to assess psychological 
IPA.96  
The DAS is appropriate for use with both married and cohabitating couples. In addition to a global 
satisfaction score, this 32 -item measure consists of four subscales: Dyadic Consensus, Affectional  Expression, 
Dyadic Satisfaction, and Dyadic Cohesion. Several studies provide evidence for this measure’s strong 
psychometric properties.67-[ADDRESS_752835] with the participant’s 
partner.  
 
In addition to the self -report questionnaires, a  collateral contact [INVESTIGATOR_8178] m will be completed by [CONTACT_573456]. The 
form includes contact [CONTACT_573457] s that research staff can contact [CONTACT_573458].  
 
Intervention and Integrity Measure Refinement  
 
To facilitate the rapid integration of the information into the refinement of the intervention and materials, 
meeting summaries will be content analyzed using a rapid coding technique based on methods of Sobo et al.70,71  
Based on Stakeholder Advisory Boar d recommendations and an examination of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], refinements 
will be made to the SAH-C manual. As a final working version becomes available, intervention integrity 
measures will be refined based on changes to the manual and  psychoeducational  interve ntion  integrity ratings  
(5) Phase 2: Randomized Trial/Pre -Implementation Phase  
(a) Study Design  
The refined intervention  manual and integrity measures from Phase [ADDRESS_752836] identical to those 
described for Phase 1 in Section D.2.3. , with the exceptions that they will be notified that they will participate i n 
one of two possible interventions.  
As in Phase 1, all assessments will remain confidential and will be stored separately from one another. Each 
assessment will also entail the provision of information regarding safety planning and IPA resources.  
14 
 (b) Assignment to Groups  
Random assignment will be completed after study enrollment using computer -generated random numbers. 
Assignment to conditions will be conducted using urn randomization methods to balance conditions on case 
severity. Urn randomization alte rs the probability of assignment to study conditions based on imbalances that 
resulted from prior random assignments.74 This methodology allows for random assignment of each case, and 
maintains the possibility that each individual will be assigned to either condition, while at the same time 
reducing the chance of imbalances in prognostic factors that can threaten the valid ity of small -sample clinical 
trials.  
(c) Interventions  
In total, 28 intervention groups will be conducted (14 for each condition), with five couples per group. 
Please see Section  2.c. for an initial outline of the SAH-C intervention. The SP intervention, u sed in our prior 
trial, is based on the work of Jennings76 and on Yalom’s77 primary therapeutic factors for group intervention. 
This intervention involves minimal facilitator -directed intervention beyond encouragement of a mutually 
supportive environment a nd focus on relationship issues. In ST, the provider  will allow group members to set 
the session agenda and address themes and topi[INVESTIGATOR_573432]. The 
provider  will emphasize a collaborative group norm and refrain from using active skills -training interventions. 
The p rovider  will be instructed to address the group as a whole rather than individuals, and use brief 
verbalizations and nonverbal gestures to stimulate  vigorous and helpful group interactions. This intervention 
was chosen to examine the relative benefits of the cognitive and behavioral interventions used in SAH-C.  
(d) Intervention Integrity  
Intervention integrity for SAH-C will be monitored using the intervention integrity measures used during 
Phase 1, as outlined in Section D.2.5. The same procedure will be used to measure intervention integrity for the 
SP condition, utilizing the modified SP codes developed in our previou s trial. A framework of adaptations and 
modifications to evidence -based interventions78 will be used to complement the integrity measure and identify 
any adaptations that the trained psychoeducational facilitator  make s within session to address potential 
challenges or participant needs. Intervention  integrity and adaptation data will be examined as implementation 
outcomes and will also be integrated with qualitative data to understand challenges to delivering the  
intervention  with an adequate level of integ rity and perceptions of the effectiveness of any adaptations that are 
made.  
(e) Additional Intervention and Early Termination  
Participants may receive additional types of intervention during this trial. Any additional intervention will 
be monitored for descriptive purposes. Study participants may be terminated from the group if they become 
actively suicidal or homicidal or fail t o attend three consecutive scheduled meetings without a reason deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_47477] . All participants who are terminated early will continue to be followed for all 
subsequent assessments.  
(f) Feasibility  
In order to enhance recruitment an d achieve our target recruitment goals, we will seek approval from the 
Medical Treatment Facility Commander and the Garrison Commander.  We will then attend all hands meetings 
in order to brief the troops on this research. All necessary permissions from Med ical and Line Commanders will 
be obtained in order to accomplish this research. Preliminary conversations have already commenced with these 
officers, who have expressed their willingness to meet with us to find the best way to implement the study once 
the grant has been awarded.  
15 
 There are currently 383 referrals annually to the Family Advocacy Program  at Madigan Army Medical 
Center  that do not meet the criteria for domestic abuse, but still require help in working through the various 
challenges associated w ith solving differences about money, children, sex, and friends. In addition, there are 4 
M&FTs who work full time providing services to couples who have not yet come to the attention of the Family 
Advocacy Program. These providers average around [ADDRESS_752837] es per year each. Thus , there is a pool of more 
than 1,600 couples who could be referred for SAH-C during the recruitment period, which would help us easily 
meet our recruitment goal.  
(g) Attrition  
We expect relatively low attrition since we are only inclu ding participants if they indicate that they plan to 
remain on base for the next six months and given previous rates of attrition obtained by [CONTACT_375600]. To limit attrition,  the research coordinator will contact [CONTACT_573459] r in-person 
assessments.  We have planned for a 12% attrition rate. Reasons for attrition will be assessed as potential 
barriers to implementation.  
Participants (service members and partners) will separately receive remuneration of a $ [ADDRESS_752838] or 
a $[ADDRESS_752839] status .  
16 
 (h) Intervention after Completion of Trial  
Following the completion of the final assessment, all participants assigned to the SP condition will be 
offered the opportunity to participate in a SAH-C group. This partici pation would be entirely voluntary and 
would involve no further assessment or remuneration.  
(6) Measures  
(a) Outcome Measures  
Outcome assessments are identical to those from Phase [ADDRESS_752840] -Intervention  satisfaction, suicidality measure,  MMEA80,  CTS244, ongoing 
intervention  questionnaire,  and DAS69.  
(b) Intervention Compliance Measure  
Session Attendance  will be measured as the total number of group sessions attended by [CONTACT_573460].  
(7) Stakeholder Meetings  
Stakeholder meetings will be held to discuss study performance and needs of the study , such as discussions 
related to study recruitment, barriers to participation, and dissemination of research findings . 
 
(c) Intent -to-Treat (ITT) versus “Adequate Dose” Analyses  
 
An ITT philosophy will be strictly adopted. Experts in clinical trials have noted that no consensus exists 
about how missing data should be handled in ITT analyses, and different imputation approaches result in 
various potential biases. Thus, there is no single definition of ITT, and the phrase carries different meanings for 
different r esearchers.87,[ADDRESS_752841] received an “adequate dose” o f the group intervention over the course of the study. We 
intend to focus on a comparison of those who had an adequate dose versus completed the intervention, because 
the group sessions will continue in spi[INVESTIGATOR_232221] a couple’s non -attendance. This approach is consistent with prior 
group interventions.89 It is recognized that the ITT and adequate dose analyses address different questions, and 
only the ITT analyses permit strong inferences. However, there is important information to be gained in looking 
at the da ta both ways.  
 
(d) Primary Data Analyses   
 
Formal data analyses will be conducted only on those subjects recruited during Phase [ADDRESS_752842], as 
this is the only phase that includes random assignment. Differences between the SAH-C groups and SP groups 
on the frequency of physical and psychological IPA and relationship satisfaction (Aim 1) will be examined with 
random -effects regression models, using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM5).90 Random -effects regression 
models provide more flexibility in model ing missing data than general linear models. They do not require data 
to be missing completely at random, but only missing at random (that is, the probability of missingness is 
17 
 assumed to be a function of observed covariates and previously measured outcome s, but not unobserved 
outcomes). Based on such considerations, this type of an approach has been recommended for analyzing 
outcomes in prevention trials as it is generally more powerful than traditional repeated measures analyses of 
variance.[ADDRESS_752843] to model person -specific effects (i.e., time course for each 
participant), as well as the variation of responses between individuals. In addition, because of the suspected 
intraclass correlation between individuals nested with in intervention groups, couples, and perhaps intervention 
site, these variables will be treated as fixed effects in the analyses. Time will be modeled as a random effect, 
and condition ( SAH-C and ST) will be a fixed effect. Change in intervention outcomes over time and differences 
between the conditions over time (intervention by [CONTACT_25218]) will be examined. The primary effect size 
for the study will be derived from the random regression analyses, and specifically the intervention by [CONTACT_573461] n, which will compare the two groups across intervention and follow ups. There are covariates that are 
a priori  hypothesized to be associated with intervention outcomes, including socioeconomic status and 
education, and these will be included in follow -up analyses to significantly reduce error variance.  
  
(e) Exploratory Analyses   
 
Differences between the two group conditions in participant intervention compliance (Aim 2) will be 
explored by [CONTACT_573462] s.  
  
(f) Qualitative Analytic Strategy and Data Integration   
Both intervention  integrity and adaptation will be assessed. Descriptive statistics will be examined. Findings 
will be linked with interview data to facilitate understanding of reasons for, and perceived benefits of, any 
adaptations that are made to SAH-C within session, as well as to understand any barriers to, or facilitators of, 
intervention  integrity. To examine Subaims 3. 1 and 3. 2, we are embedding qualitative methods within the study 
and connecting them to quantitative data (e.g., intervention credibility and satisfaction measures, study 
outcomes, reasons for attrition, homework compliance and therapeutic alliance) for the purpose  of expansion 
and development. Established procedures to enhance validity will be used, including development of an audit 
trail documenting analytical decisions. All data will be checked for accuracy and entered into NVivo qualitative 
data management softw are. All coding decisions will be noted for further review. Rater agreement will be 
assessed through a second rater coding a subset of the data, and agreement will be reported. We will also use a 
check -coding model where the primary coder will code and rec ode the same material to ensure there is over a 
90% consistency.  
We will use a theory -driven approach to explore the relationship between the findings and the CFIR 
framework. The goals, objectives and key research questions will guide all aspects of the q ualitative analyses. 
Using content analysis, we will identify analytical categories to describe and explain observations. Our work 
will occur in five stages, outlined in the Mays et al.92 approach to qualitative analysis: 1) Familiarization, 2) 
Identifying  a Thematic Framework, 3) Indexing, 4) Charting, and 5) Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_573433]. In stage 2, 
codes will be derived deductively by [CONTACT_573463] (e.g., elements of 
the CFIR framework) and inductively by [CONTACT_573464]. We will work 
from a list of research questions (e.g., What provider , participant, and setting -level factors might explain 
outcomes if outcomes are inconsistent with prior research? What are potential barriers a nd facilitators to future 
deployment? What adaptations might be needed to SAH-C for successful future deployment in routine care 
military settings?). We will develop a codebook with operational definitions of each code. Using constant 
comparison, we will u pdate the coding model to reflect further refinement. In the charting and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_126837], 
we will integrate the qualitative and quantitative data for expansion, development, and convergence, identify 
themes, and look for the commonalities and variations in  themes and findings related to training, feasibility, 
acceptability, and intervention  integrity -related issues. Data integration will assist a fine -grained understanding 
of processes and characteristics that may influence effectiveness and implementation outcomes.  
[ADDRESS_752844] contributed to 
these findings, and determine appropriate next steps for research accordingly.  
(g) Power Analysis  
 
Power analyses were based on the main hypotheses that SAH-C would reduce the level of IPA to a greater 
degree than the SP condition by [CONTACT_941] 3 -month follow -up assessments. Estimates affecting power (e.g., effect size, 
intra-class correlations, attrition) wer e derived from our prior CDC funded study.  
 
Our first consideration in estimating the necessary sample size for detecting differential change over time in 
SAH-C versus SP in terms of IPA incidence was the expected incidence rate of IPA during the follow -up period. 
Our sample is at high risk for such incidence as defined by [CONTACT_573465]. While 
there is no prospective military data available that directly speaks to such incidence rates, available estimates 
suggest a 33% one -year prevalence of IPA among trauma exposed service members.[ADDRESS_752845], approximately 16% of cases of IPA would emerge (half of the one 
year prevalence). However, inclusion of only couples with high levels of marital distress will increase this 
estimated incidence rate. Accordingly, we expect an increase of 10% in the incidence rate. Together, we based 
power analyses on an estimated 26% one -year incidence rate. Our second consideration involved e xpected 
sample attrition. Based on our prior trial and the specific plan for data capture outlined for the project, we 
estimate that about 15% of participants will provide no follow -up assessment data. However, power analyses 
were conducted based on the co nservative estimate of 20% assessment dropout. Consistent with an ITT 
approach, regardless of intervention dropout, we will assess participants randomized into the trial. Thus, 
dropout from measurement versus intervention is of greatest concern. Our third consideration involved expected 
within -subjects correlations. The within -subjects correlation was estimated as the average correlation observed 
in our previous trial for pre -intervention, post -intervention, and follow -up data on reports of physical and 
psychological IPA on the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS -2).44 These correlations ranged from .53 to .90. 
We also considered the expected intra -class (group) correlation, which was approximately .05. Finally, 
consistent with recommendations,94 we consider ed the intra -class (dyadic) correlation among couples. We did 
not incorporate an estimate of such correlations into power analyses because of our proposed use of a composite 
measure of IPA, which results in a single index of IPA, thereby [CONTACT_573466] -dyad correlations. Together, 
we assumed an intra -class correlation of .[ADDRESS_752846] size of d = 1.01. A conservative 
estimate of a mean effect size of d = .[ADDRESS_752847]. Power analyses were conducted for the main hypothesis tests involving IPA perpetration 
and were conducted using the GEESIZE Macro in SAS Proc Mixed according to recommendations for 
estimating sample sizes needed in repeated measures experiments.95 Together, assuming (1) 26% incidence of 
IPA in the control condition, (2) 20% overall attrition, (3) .70 within -subjects correlation, (6) d = .5, (5) two -
tailed, and (6) p < .05, the proposed total N of 280 (140 couples) will provide ample power (> .9) to det ect 
differences in IPA frequency across experimental conditions.  
19 
 (8) Human Studies Section  
(a) Risk to Subjects  
Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics  
The study population consists of service members attached to an installation who may be at risk for intimate 
partner aggression (IPA) and their intimate partners. The participants will be 150 service members (10 in Phase 
1; 140 in Phase 2) and their partne rs who will provide data on IPA. The research team has conducted several 
intervention  studies with military samples. There are currently 383 referrals annually to the Family Advocacy 
Program  at Madigan Army Medical Center  that do not meet the criteria for domestic abuse, but still require help 
in working through the various challenges associated with solving differences about money, children, sex, and 
friends. In addition, there are 4 M&FTs who work full time providing services to couples who have not yet 
come to the attention of the Family Advocacy Program , Madigan Army Medical Center . These providers 
average around 210 couples per year each. Thus , there is a pool of more than 1,600 couples who could be 
referred for SAH-C during the recruitment period, whic h would help us easily meet our recruitment goal.  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteri a  
Inclusion criteria are as follows: (a) couples  (heterosexual and same -sex dyads)  must be in an intimate 
relationship ; (b) participants and their partners must be over the age of 18, due to our emphasis on adult IPA, 
and so that all participants will be legally able to provide consent without parental involvement; (c) both 
members of the couple report no occurrence of ph ysical IPA in the past 3 months ; (d) at least one member of 
the couple reports at or below a score of 100 on the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), a cutoff score used to 
distinguish relationship distress, or they report the presence of psychological aggressio n in the past three 
months ; and (e) both members of the couple provide research consent. Pregnant women are eligible to 
participate in this study. Research indicates that pregnant women may be at increased risk for intimate partner 
victimization. Thus, vio lence prevention interventions may be particularly applicable and important for this 
group. Potential participants will be excluded on the basis of reading difficulties that preclude valid completion 
of the assessment instruments . 
Gender Inclusion   
The cou ples-based interventions studied make it likely  that equal numbers of men and women will 
participate. However, we will make no exclusions related to gender/gender identity, and same -sex couples are 
also eligible for participation.  
 
Minority Inclusion   
Across the study sites, 70% of potential participants are Caucasian, 20% are African American, and 10% are 
of another ethnicity.  
(b) Sources of Materials    
Data will be obtained from subjects from self-report measures completed  through the online data collection 
tool, REDCap . Data will not be collected from routine medical care. All data gather ed and analyzed will be 
obtained for this specific study. Study participation will not be documented in participants’ electronic medical 
records.  
20 
 (c) Potential Risks   
Given that all participants will be in a program designed to improve relationships and prevent IPA, the 
added risks are those associated with the research assessments. All participants will be encouraged to discuss 
any painful issues that arise during the initial assessment. Those who do not receive intervention will be 
provided with referrals for counseling during the assessments as well as information on safety and resources for 
victims of abuse, such as 24 -hour hotline numbers and shelter/legal services information. All participants who 
complete the Supportive Prevention  group intervention will also have the option to participate in the Strength at 
Home -Couples’  intervention.  
AEs/SAEs will be reported according to VABHS IRB SOP by [CONTACT_553552] -site study coordi nator. Reporting will 
be directed to [CONTACT_573477], who will ensure this is reported to the VABHS IRB.  
A second risk involves the possibility that material discussed during research assessments will become the 
topic of a violent conflict. To minimize this risk,  all assessments will be conducted separately with partners.  
Additionally, the loss of confidentiality by [CONTACT_573467] a risk. To minimize this risk we discuss 
that group members will use only their first names and they agree to not discuss what  is said in the group with 
others outside of the group.   
(9) Adequacy of Protection from Risks   
(a) Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Recruitment will occur through referrals made by [CONTACT_573468]. Referrals will come from the 
Family Advocacy Program (FAP) , Embedded Behavioral Health, Chaplain  service s, Military and Family Life 
Counselor Program (MFLC),  couples r etreats , other program and prevention facilities, and through the posting 
of fliers  and brochures  in public areas and media advertising to promote the program  and to be more inclusive . 
We will not disclose willingness to participate to anyone else in the service members’  unit or in the U.S. Armed 
forces other than research regulatory bodies. We will also omit the witness signature [CONTACT_379994]. 
Finally, only the investigato rs or the [LOCATION_011] without compensation (WOC) project coordinator may obtain 
consent from potential participants. Study staff  will be available at all times to oversee this process and respond 
to questions. Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_573434]. Study volunteers will be given a copy of the 
consent form for their records. The inv estigators will keep the other.  The original  paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_573435] a locked filing cabinet in a secure data storage room during the project and  will then be 
securely shipped to the [LOCATION_011] VA  via a track able shippi[INVESTIGATOR_19188] (e.g., Fed Ex). To ensure confidentiality, 
ICFs will ultimately be stored in a locked filing cabinet in a secure data storage room at the [LOCATION_011] VA . 
 
Informed consent   
The consent process will be conducted by [CONTACT_573469]. Informed consent will be 
conducted with each member of the dyad in separate rooms. No study procedures will occur prior to participants 
giving informed consent.  
For the consent proc edure, each individual will meet one -on-one briefly with the study staff member to 
indicate his/her willingness to participate in the study. The study staff member will review the study procedures 
and have the individual sign the form if he/she would like to participate.  
[ADDRESS_752848] history, the CTS-2 to assess lifetime history of IPA in their current relationship , the suicidality 
measure , and the demographics questionnaire . If either participant fails to meet study eligibility requirements, 
the couple’s participation wi ll end. If IPA is reported by [CONTACT_573470], the trained psychoeducational facilitator  
will separately inform them that they are not eligible for this study, and will assess the victim or victims’ 
perceptions of safety, discuss safety planning with the vi ctim(s) (e.g., packing a small bag with a change of 
clothes and important papers in the event that s/he needs to escape), and will provide them with local contact 
[CONTACT_573471]. Victims will be educated by [CONTACT_573472].  
  In the event a participant endorses suicidal ideation, the facilitator will conduct safety planning and offer a 
referral to FAP for additional assistance. If there is imminent threat, the facilita tor will inform FAP to conduct a 
formal suicide assessment or accompany the participant to the emergency room. Additionally, if they have a 
counselor we will direct them to contact [CONTACT_573473].  
(b) Protection Against Risk   
Given that all pa rticipants will be in a program designed to improve relationships and prevent IPA, the 
added risks are those associated with the research assessments. All participants will be encouraged to discuss 
any painful issues that arise during the initial assessmen t. Those who do not receive intervention will be 
provided with referrals for counseling during the assessments as well as information on safety and resources for 
victims of abuse, such as 24 -hour hotline numbers and shelter/legal services information. All participants who 
complete the Supportive Prevention  group intervention will also have the option to participate in the Strength at 
Home -Couples’  intervention.  
A second risk involves the possibility that material discussed during assessments will become the topic of a 
violent conflict. To minimize this risk, all assessments will be conducted separately with partners.  
All identifying information (e.g., signed consent forms) will be stored separately from the research 
questionnaires. Separate locked, secure files will be used to store study materials for each participant, and 
couple’s files will be kept in separate stora ge areas to ensure confidentiality and safety. Identity masking subject 
numbers assigned to each participant will be the only means by [CONTACT_573474]. Each 
participant will have his or her own assigned number. Subject numbers will r eflect the link between 
participating members of the couple. The only list that will link the names of the participants with their subject 
numbers will be kept in a secure, password -protected computer account accessible only to the on-site study 
staff. Study results will be presented and/or published in a fashion to ensure that participants cannot be 
identified.  
Data collected through the REDCap system will be encrypted and unidentifiable  to REDCap staff. It will be 
accessed only by [CONTACT_573475] -McChord  and [LOCATION_011] VA Healthcare System.  
 (10) Potential Benefit of the Proposed Research to the Subject and Others  
[ADDRESS_752849] an opportunit y to discuss their situation with a trained psychoeducational 
facilitator . The facilitator  will be prepared to complete a safety plan with the victim, provide support, and give 
information about local hotlines and shelter/legal services. Second, all partic ipants will be scheduled to receive 
a program designed to prevent aggressive behavior. Finally, the findings are likely to benefit others through the 
possible enhancement of relationships and prevention of IPA in the future.  
(11) Importance of the Knowledg e to be Gained  
There is no currently available evidence -based intervention for military couples to prevent negative 
trajectories that may include IPV from developi[INVESTIGATOR_573436]. The Strength 
at Home -Couples’ (SAH -C) program  was designed to fill this gap in services and assist in preventing IPA in 
those couples who may be at risk for relationship problems. Through a recently completed randomized 
controlled trial funded by [CONTACT_13802], we have shown SAH-C to be effective in preventing 
both physical and psychological IPV relative to those receiving a Supportive Prevention  intervention among 
veterans and service members within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Before we disseminate SAH-C on a 
large scale on military installations, it would be important to examine its efficacy in this particular setting and to 
identify any potential barriers and facilitators for implementation. Potential short -term impacts from the current 
study would be to demonstrate best cl inical practices in reducing IPV risk and preventing IPV in military dyads. 
Long term, study results could assist in changing the way we manage and prevent IPV, not only in military 
settings, but also beyond the military context since trauma is linked with  violence in civilians in addition to 
military members.

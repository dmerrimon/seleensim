62 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
2.1 Background Information 
Current guidelines recommend yearly influenza vaccination for all children ≥6 months of age 
[1]; however the effect this has on the evolution of the anti-influenza immune response through 
childhood and into adulthood is poorly understood.  Though far from idea, yearly vaccination is 
necessary at present due to the ongoing antigenic drift that occurs as viruses continually evolve 
to evade neutralizing antibody.  There is currently much interest in the development of a 
universal influenza vaccination that would be able to provide protection against both seasonal 
and potentially pandemic strains of influenza [2].  However, a growing body of evidence 
suggests that early childhood influenza exposures result in imprinting that profoundly shapes 
lifelong CD4 T cell and B cell mediated immunity to this virus [3, 4].  An improved 
understanding of immunity to influenza virus in early childhood is thus needed if a more broadly 
protective approach to influenza vaccination is to be successful. 
Natural influenza infection stimulates vigorous inflammation with activation of multiple pattern 
recognition receptors.  This leads to a robust innate immune response characterized by 
[CONTACT_494675][INVESTIGATOR_494642] [5-8].  As the infection progresses, viral replication 
results in abundant intracellular antigen that can be processed and presented to activate the 
adaptive immune response [5,6].  While neutralizing antibodies are thought of as the major 
correlate of protection [9-12], cellular immunity is increasingly recognized as important in 
protecting from severe disease [13-16], especially as T cells can recognize conserved epi[INVESTIGATOR_494643] a poor vaccine 
match or a pandemic influenza strain emerges [17-21].  In contrast to the robust responses that 
develop following influenza infection, the immune response generated on vaccination with IIV is 
characterized by [CONTACT_494676].  IIV is produced by [CONTACT_494677] 
H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B viral strains predicted to be circulating with disruption and 
purification of the surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) [22-24]  This process results in 
production of an unadjuvanted vaccine that contains variable levels of NA, small amounts of 
internal virion proteins including NP, and only trace amounts of innate immune activators such 
as viral RNA [22, 25-27].  
Given the profound differences in antigenic context between natural infection and vaccination, 
this study will investigate how these different routes of early childhood exposure to influenza 
affect the functional potential of the anti-influenza immune response and determine the 
consequences this has on subsequent influenza vaccination.  This improved knowledge of how 
early childhood influenza vaccination shapes the establishment of anti-influenza immunologic 
memory will enable both optimization of current influenza vaccination strategies and 
development of novel vaccines able to provide highly efficacious universal protection against 
both seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza strains. 
18-[ADDRESS_636261] both the CD4 T cell and B cell immunity.  Recent data in the 
literature [3, 4,28], and our own preliminary data suggest that initial encounters with influenza 
have a long lasting effect on both CD4 T cell and B cell mediated immunity.  This protocol will 
address how early immunity against influenza virus is primed by [CONTACT_494678]-challenge with 
influenza vaccination.  We will specifically test whether the more robust pro-inflammatory 
response initiated on first exposure to a natural influenza infection promotes imprinting of both 
CD4 T cell and B cell responses, influencing long term specificity and functionality.  We also 
will examine the effects of age and exposure on the immune response that develops following 
influenza vaccination.  To do this, we will first examine whether early exposure to a live viral 
infection compared to vaccination leads to a distinct phenotype and specificity in both the B cell 
and CD4 T cell compartments.  Subsequently, we will determine whether the CD4 T cell 
repertoire is remodeled over time by [CONTACT_494679]4 T cell specificity, cytokine production, and 
expression of markers and transcriptional factors associated with a negative regulatory CD4 T 
cell phenotype in children of different ages versus adults.  
The age range of the first cohort was chosen to enroll infants in their first influenza season with 
no history of prior exposure to influenza virus.  Thus, this age cohort will allow examination of 
the true primary response to influenza infection or inactivated vaccination.  Children between [ADDRESS_636262] an initial 
prevaccination blood draw and will then receive a dose of inactivated influenza vaccine. These 
children will then receive a booster dose of the inactivated influenza vaccine, with vaccine doses 
separated by 28 (+ 14) days as recommended by [CONTACT_65746]. A post vaccination blood draw will 
only be performed following the second vaccine dose [1].  To minimize blood draws, we will 
perform the next blood draw to interrogate the immune response following the second vaccine 
dose.  Children between 3 and 12 months of age who present with an influenza-like illness will 
be eligible to participate in the infection cohort (1B).  Study personnel will obtain nasal swabs 
from potential subjects for a rapid influenza antigen test on illness presentation (typi[INVESTIGATOR_494644] 2-[ADDRESS_636263] illness onset) if influenza testing was not completed by [CONTACT_494680].  In the event that influenza testing result is pending or completed by a medical 
provider, results of this test will be obtained through review of the medical record.  If positive, 
subjects will be eligible for further study participation.  Given the low sensitivity of rapid 
influenza testing, influenza real-time RT-PCR will be used to confirm all rapid antigen test 
results, with subjects recruited for further study participation if RT-PCR testing is positive.  In 
addition, if the subject is eligible for enrollment based on a positive influenza test result by [CONTACT_494681], a nasal swab for 
additional influenza real time RT-PCR testing may be obtained during the first study visit (study 
visit 1, or visit 2 if visit 1 is by[CONTACT_92842]) in order to obtain further information regarding the 
infecting influenza serotype if possible.  
The age ranges of the subsequent cohorts were chosen to capture the likely exposure histories of 
enrolled children, specifically surrounding exposure to the [ADDRESS_636264] received 2 vaccine 
doses and thus may require both a priming and a booster dose of vaccine in year 2 of the study 
[29].  The second age cohort (> 12 months, birthdate after 2009) will likely have had exposure to 
the [ADDRESS_636265] age cohort (birthdate between 2006 and 
2009) may or may not have had early exposure to the 2009 pandemic virus, while the final 
cohort (birthdate between 2003 and 2006) will likely have had early childhood exposures to the 
previously seasonal H1N1 viral strains.  
Blood draws will be obtained on study enrollment, day 8 (+2d), and day 24 (+/- 4d) post 
enrollment as depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1.  The blood draw on study enrollment will evaluate influenza-
specific immunity at the time of study entry.  The blood draw on day 8 (+2d) post-vaccination 
will allow examination of each subject as CD4 T cell and plasmablast responses are peaking, 
while the day 24 (+/- 4d) time point will capture the peak of the neutralizing antibody response 
and allow us to examine CD4 T cell responses as they contract.  All subjects will be followed 
through to the subsequent influenza season, at which point they will be rechallenged with IIV.  
Blood draws will again be obtained pre-vaccination and at days 8 (+2d) and 24 (+/- 4d) post 
vaccine administration, with the pre-vaccination blood draw providing a method to assess for 
undocumented influenza infection over the prior year.  Upon completion of the planned follow 
up visits, subjects will be offered the opportunity to  participate in the study for an addition 
influenza season to enable collection of longitudinal data on the development of early life anti-
influenza immunity.  
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits
2.3.1 Potential Risks
The risks and discomforts of this study include risks associated with the vaccine, administration 
of the vaccine, the risks associated with study procedures (blood drawing and nasal and throat 
swabs) and possible loss of confidentiality.
In placebo-controlled trials in children, inactivated seasonal vaccines are associated with mild 
local pain at the site of administration and occasional systemic symptoms.  According to the 
package insert, systemic symptoms like fever occur in 14.3% of infants and 7% of children.  
Likewise, some irritability (54.1%) was seen in infants, with abnormal crying occasionally 
reported.  The most common adverse events reported remain local symptoms, with injection site 
pain (57-66%), tenderness (54.1%), erythema (37.3-34.1%), and swelling (21.6-24.8%) common.  
As influenza vaccination is considered the standard of care, these risks will be no greater than 
what children will be exposed to through current best practice recommendations [1].
During the swine influenza vaccine campaign of 1976, about 10 per 1,000,000 vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_494645]-Barre Syndrome 
(GBS).  In the subsequent decade, no association between seasonal influenza vaccine and GBS 
was found. More extensive investigations of this potential association occurring in the 1990s 
revealed that there was a small but detectable risk of GBS in the 6 weeks following seasonal

                                                                                                                                                              04 February 2021

9influenza immunization: an attributable risk of approximately 1 per 1,000,000, adjusted for 
potential confounders.  In the period since the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS) was established in 1990, the rates of GBS reports following influenza vaccination have 
declined substantially. The annual reporting rate in that period was highest in the 1993-1994 
influenza season (1.7 per 1,000,000 vaccinees) and lowest in the last season analyzed in the 
report, 2002-2003 (0.4 per 1,000,000 vaccinees) [30].  GBS is thus considered highly unlikely 
after influenza vaccination and, as vaccination is considered the standard of care for all infants 
≥[ADDRESS_636266] pediatric care [1].
All blood will be drawn by [CONTACT_494682], with pain 
minimized through comforting and distraction techniques.  Only the minimum amount of blood 
necessary to achieve the study objectives will be obtained, with the blood volume being within a 
level accepted as safe (Table 1).  As a child’s total blood volume is related to body weight, we 
have chosen a weight based approach to determine the volume of blood to be obtained.  This will 
allow us to optimize our likelihood of being able to accomplish the study objectives while still 
prioritizing the safety of the child (see Scientific Rationale section).  The proposed blood draws 
in this protocol impose a maximum upper limit of 1 mL/kg on any single draw (about 1.25% of 
estimated TBV), with a maximum of 3 mL/kg (about 3.75% of estimated TBV) over any 8 week 
period for all pediatric patients (Table 1).  This volume remains well below the upper limit of 
10% of total blood volume in an 8 week period and is consistent with the available evidence on 
what will present minimal risk to children [31] while still providing enough PBMCs to perform 
the in depth analysis of CD4 T and B cell specificity and functional capacity as well as antibody 
responses required for this study.
Drawing blood causes transient discomfort and may cause fainting.  Bruising at the blood draw 
site may occur but can be prevented or mitigated by [CONTACT_494683]. The use of alcohol swabbing and sterile equipment will make infection less 
likely at the site where blood will be drawn.  The volume of blood per kg body weight being 
drawn is within a range considered safe.  However, some older children may develop transient 
lightheadedness following blood drawing as a result of a vaso-vagal reflex.  This will be 
discussed with parents/LARs at the time of the consent.  If such a reaction occurs, the child will 
be laid down, have a blood pressure obtained, and be observed until the symptoms pass (but for 
at least 10 minutes).  
Nasal swabs and washes can be uncomfortable and may cause gagging or occasionally minor 
brief irritation and rarely transient bleeding.  Long term side effects from these procedures are 
considered extremely unlikely.
Personal health information of the subjects will be collected to determine eligibility and to 
evaluate outcomes throughout the study. Research personnel will make every effort to keep this 
information confidential. Still, a risk of participation is that the confidentiality of this information 
could be lost.

135 STUDY POPULATION
It is anticipated that this study will enroll a total of approximately 220 subjects.  This includes 
140 children in the vaccination cohort [20 children between 6-12 months, 60 children with a 
birth date after 2009 (35 children <3 years of age and 25 children >=3 years of age), 30 children 
with a birth date between 2006 and 2009, and 30 children with a birth date between 2003 and 
2006].  We also will enroll up to 80 children total who present with acute influenza infection 
(20 children into each of the 4 age cohorts).  We anticipate having to screen up to [ADDRESS_636269] respi[INVESTIGATOR_494646] a result of influenza virus infection.  It is anticipated approximately two-thirds of 
the children in all cohorts (both A and B) will enroll in the optional year of longitudinal follow-
up.
The goal of this study is to understand the development of influenza-specific immunity in a 
population of children in the [COMPANY_002]ster, NY area.  Children will be excluded from participation 
in the study if they meet exclusion criteria of the protocol such as having a documented 
immunodeficiency or are on immunosuppressive medications expected to have a more than a 
minimal impact on the development of an immune response to vaccination or infection.  Other 
conditions that may possibly have more than a minimal effect a child’s immune system, such as 
allergies or other hypersensitivity syndromes, mild asthma, or obesity, will be able to enroll in 
the study.  The presence or absence of concomitant medications and medical conditions will be 
documented and the effect of potential confounding variables will be examined in data analysis.  
Children in the vaccination cohort will be recruited either by [CONTACT_193858], via a letter sent under 
authorship of his/her PCP, or in person at the Strong Pediatric Practice, Elmwood Pediatrics, or 
Lewis Pediatrics.  Children recruited by [CONTACT_494685] a follow-up phone call from study 
staff in [ADDRESS_636270] in participating when possible.  We will also reach out to 
parents/LARs participating in RSRB protocol [ADDRESS_636271] and parent/LAR are interested in 
study participation. 
Acute influenza cases will be identified through the Strong Pediatric Practice, Elmwood 
Pediatrics, Lewis Pediatrics, the Pediatric Emergency Departments at Strong Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494647], or one of the UR-affiliated Urgent Care Centers by [CONTACT_494686].  Additionally, we will have flyers with contact [CONTACT_494687] a child with symptoms of ILI.  Finally, records from influenza tests performed in the 
URMC Clinical Microbiology Laboratory will be reviewed and potentially eligible subjects 
with a documented acute influenza infection will be contact[CONTACT_494688].  
Please see URMC Notice of Privacy Practices page 2 section on RESEARCH, which states "We 
may use and disclose medical information about you for research purposes. In most cases we 
will ask for your written authorization. However, under some circumstances we may use and 
disclose your health information without your written authorization if doing so poses minimal 
risk to your privacy. We may also release your medical information without your written 
18-[ADDRESS_636272] 
you to ask if you want to participate in such research."  Subjects who present with an ILI will 
complete a brief consent for screening by [CONTACT_494689].  In the event that influenza testing 
is pending or has been completed by a medical provider, results of this test will be obtained 
through review of the medical record.  If positive, parents/LARs will be approached to 
participate in the full study.  If rapid influenza testing is negative, a confirmatory PCR will be 
completed.  Children with ILI that initially test positive by  [CONTACT_494690].  Every attempt will 
be made to have these children complete all study visits, but in the situation when the 
parent/LAR is unable to be reached prior to day [ADDRESS_636273] the option to enroll for a additional 1 year follow-up 
upon reviewing and signing a “consent for longitudinal follow-up” to be presented to the subject 
and their parent/LAR at one of the scheduled year [ADDRESS_636274] number, with an “R” appended at the end of the subject 
number so that they can be identified as a reenrollment.

7.1 Screening
Potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_494695], Elmwood 
Pediatrics, Lewis Pediatrics, the Pediatric Emergency Departments at Strong Memorial 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or one of the UR-affiliated Urgent Care Centers.  The Emergency Department 
Research Associate (EDRA) Program is being utilized to recruit subjects seeking care for 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_494658]-affiliated Urgent Care Centers.  Records from influenza tests performed 
in the Clinical Microbiology Labs at URMC will be reviewed and potentially eligible 
subjects acutely infected with influenza will be contact[CONTACT_494696].  Although University of Chicago is a scientific lead on this study, they will be sent 
coded samples with no recruitment or enrollment activities taking place at University of 
Chicago (MTA and LDUA in place).  
We will also contact [CONTACT_7903]/LARs of children previously participating in RSRB Protocol 
[ZIP_CODE] (Understanding how the initial encounter with influenza virus poises children for 
protective immunity) who have consented for contact [CONTACT_494697] (A) of the study.   
On identification of a potential subject, the subject’s care provider or study staff when there 
is a positive influenza test documented by [CONTACT_494698]/LAR is 
interested in learning more about this study, either in person at one of our participating 
practices, by [CONTACT_648], or via a letter sent to the parent/LAR.  Parents/LARs that receive a letter 
describing the study may be contact[CONTACT_258074] [ADDRESS_636285] in study participation.  If a parent/LAR expresses interest in 
the study and the subject is potentially eligible, screening and consent will take place either 
within the office/ED or the parent/LAR will be asked to schedule an appointment for 
screening and consent in the VRU.  Screening records will be kept to document the reasons 
why an individual was consented for the study but failed trial entry criteria.   Contact

7.2   Enrollment/Baseline (Visit 1)
Once subjects meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria and parents or a LAR 
provide consent for participation in the study, the subjects will be enrolled. 
Subjects enrolled in the influenza vaccination cohorts will have a medical history obtained 
and demographic information collected, with particular attention to inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  If not already obtained, subject vital signs and weight will be measured.  A targeted 
physical exam, focusing on the CV and respi[INVESTIGATOR_27441], will then be performed as 
indicated by [CONTACT_9870].  Following this, a sample of peripheral venous blood will be 
obtained if able.  Subjects will then receive their initial influenza vaccination. 
Subjects recruited with potential natural influenza infection will have a complete medical 
history obtained with particular attention to current symptoms of illness and inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  Demographic information will also be collected. If not already obtained, 
subject vital signs and weight will be measured.  A targeted physical exam, with a focus on

via the clinical microbiology lab, two nasal swabs will be obtained by [CONTACT_494701]-sterilized 
soft nylon flocked swabs into alternate nostrils of the subject and gently rotating them across 
the mucosa.  One of these swabs will be used to perform a rapid influenza test, while the 
other will be placed into [ADDRESS_636287] 
information will be collected and parents/LARs will be informed that we will contact [CONTACT_494702].  Subjects that have a positive influenza test will have the opportunity to consent to 
full study participation.  If this consent is obtained, a nasal wash, nasal brush, and a sample 
of peripheral venous blood will be collected if able.  In addition, if the subject is eligible for 
enrollment based on a positive influenza test result performed by [CONTACT_494703], a nasal swab for additional influenza real time RT-PCR testing will be obtained if

influenza serotype.  Parents/LARs will then be given a memory aid to document the 
progression of their current illness and the symptoms of any future illnesses that occur, which 
we will collect at the time of their follow up visits.  Children with ILI that initially test 
positive by  [CONTACT_494704].  Every attempt will be made to have these children complete all 
study visits.  If parent/LAR is reached within [ADDRESS_636289] the onset of illness, subjects will be 
offered a home visit or asked to come to the VRU to complete the enrollment visit 1. In the 
situation when the parent/LAR is unable to be reached prior to day 5 of illness onset, the 
remaining study visit 1 procedures will be by[CONTACT_494705] 2. 
7.3 Follow-up and Final Visits
Visit 1.5: Vaccine booster visit (day 28 +14 days):
Subjects undergoing vaccination in cohort 1A will require an influenza vaccine booster dose.  
The subjects will be asked to return to VRU on day 28 (+14) following the initial influenza 
vaccination (Visit 1). At this time,  the ICF, study requirements, any returned illness memory 
aids and any adverse events or other illnesses will be reviewed.  An interim medical history, 
including vaccinations, will be obtained and medications reviewed. Vital signs and subject’s 
weight will be obtained and a targeted PE performed.  Then a dose of seasonal IIV will be 
administered intramuscularly. 
Visit 2 (day 8/36 +2 days):
Subjects may return to the VRU or have a home visit completed on day 8 (+2) following 
their presentation with influenza infection or their final influenza vaccination (this will be 
about day 36 following the initial vaccination for subjects requiring 2 doses of influenza 
vaccine).  At this time, the ICF, study requirements, any returned illness memory aids that 
document recent symptoms of illness, and any adverse events or other illnesses will be 
reviewed. An interim medical history, including vaccinations, will be obtained and 
medications reviewed. Vital signs and subject’s weight will be obtained and a targeted PE 
performed. Following this, a sample of peripheral venous blood will be obtained, if able, for 
all cohorots. Those subjects enrolled in Cohorts 1B, 2B, 3B, and 4B will also have a nasal 
wash and nasal brush obtained if able.  For subjects in the B cohorts enrolled based on a 
positive influenza test result by [CONTACT_494706], a nasal swab for 
additional influenza real time RT-PCR testing will be obtained if able during the second 
study visit if the first study visit is by[CONTACT_494707].  This will only be obtained if the subject remains 
symptomatic at the time of presentation.  
Visit 3 (day 24/52 +/- 4 days):  
Subjects may return to the VRU or have a home visit completed on day 24 (+/-4) following 
their presentation with influenza infection or their final influenza vaccination (this will be 
about day 52 following the initial vaccination for subjects requiring 2 doses of influenza 
vaccine).  At this time, the ICF, study requirements,  any returned illness memory aids that 
document recent symptoms of illness and any adverse events or other illnesses will be

wash and nasal brush obtained if able.
Illness visits:  Parents/LARs will contact [CONTACT_494708]-like illness. These symptoms include temperature of 
100.5 or more, cough, and/or runny or stuffy nose.  If the reported symptoms are consistent 
with influenza infection, the parents/LARs will be offered the opportunity to complete an 
illness visit.  At the illness visit, ICF, study requirements and any adverse events or other 
illnesses will be reviewed. An interim medical history, including vaccines, will be obtained 
and medications reviewed.  Vital signs will be obtained and a targeted PE performed. 
Following this, two nasal swabs will be obtained.  At this time, a rapid antigen influenza test 
will be conducted.  In the event the illness visit is completed as a home visit, the parent/LAR 
will be notified that the visit is being completed for research purposes only and does not take 
the place of contact[CONTACT_13742]’s primary care provider for illness evaluation.  The rapid 
influenza test will then be conducted in the home.  If the rapid influenza test is positive, the 
parent/LAR will be notified at the time of the visit and study staff will recommend the 
subject’s primary care practice be notified by [CONTACT_7071]/LAR.  All rapid influenza tests will 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_14302]-specific RT-PCR.  In the event a child is observed to be 
moderately or severely ill at an illness visit, study staff will recommend the parent or LAR 
contact [CONTACT_494709].
Visit 4 (Season 2 day 0):  Subjects will be asked to return to the VRU the following fall to 
receive seasonal influenza vaccination. At this time, the ICF, study requirements and any AE 
or other illnesses will be reviewed. Subjects will have an interval medical history obtained, 
including vaccinations and a review of all medications. Any illness memory aids returned 
will be reviewed to determine if the parent/LAR recorded any symptoms consistent with 
influenza-like illness that were not reported to study personnel. Subject weight and vital signs 
will then be obtained and a targeted physical exam performed as indicated by [CONTACT_177964].  Following this a sample of peripheral venous blood will be obtained if able.  
Subjects will then be vaccinated with seasonal IIV.  Parents/LARs will use the memory aids 
to document the symptoms of any illnesses that occur and will be instructed to call the study 
coordinator if symptoms consistent with an influenza-like illness are present.
Visit 4.5: Vaccine booster visit (Season 2 day 28 +14 days):
Children <9 years of age acutely infected with influenza (cohort B) who have not 
appropriately received 2 or more total doses of influenza vaccine will present to the VRU to 
receive their influenza vaccine booster dose on day 28 (+14) following the initial influenza 
vaccination (Visit 4). At this time, ICF, study requirements, any returned illness memory 
aids, and any adverse events or other illnesses will be reviewed. An interim medical history, 
including vaccinations, will be obtained and medications reviewed. Atargeted PE will be 
completed andvital signs and weight obtained. Then a dose of seasonal IIV will be 
administered intramuscularly.

Vaccine Research Unit, parent/LAR will be given the option to complete any visits that do 
not include the administration of vaccine as home visits if this is more convenient for them.  
Having home visits is optional and is not required to be part of the study.  When a home visit 
is conducted, the following guidelines will be followed:
The option of having certain study visits take place as home visits will be included in 
the consent form, and in all cases informed consent will be obtained prior to going 
into the subject’s home.  
Study activities will be conducted using the same methodology regardless of the 
location of the visit.  Study information will be collected on paper forms, which then 
will be transferred to our online study database on completion of the visit.
The procedure to conduct blood draws and nasal wash specimens in the home setting 
will be the same as that used in outpatient setting (per local SOP).  An experienced 
pediatric research nurse will go on all study visits to complete the blood draw.  This 
nurse will be accompanied by [CONTACT_87519] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a research assistant trained in 
how to hold subjects to optimize the success of blood collection.  If blood is unable to 
be obtained, this will be documented on the Case Report Form.  There will not be a 
requirement for the subject to present to the VRU in the event blood is unable to be 
collected. 
To ensure the safety of the researchers, study personnel will travel to the patient’s 
residence in pairs.  Members of the research team will be mandated reporters.  In the 
event that potential child abuse or neglect is observed, the case will be reported to 
Child Protective Services as required by [CONTACT_494710].  
7.[ADDRESS_636293] visit will be reviewed, and all concomitant medications will be 
recorded.  A targeted physical examination may be performed, as indicated, and information 
regarding AEs will be solicited. Any ongoing related AEs will be followed to resolution or until 
a stable chronic condition has been established.  If subjects do not wish to present for an early 
termination visit, reasons for study termination will be solicited by [CONTACT_494711].
7.6 Unscheduled Visit
Unscheduled visits may occur at any time during the study.  These visits may either be a clinic 
visit or a home visit. Depending on the nature of the visit, activities will include a review of the 
medical history including concomitant medications, assessment of adverse effects or other 
illnesses, vital signs, a targeted physical examination as necessary, and any additional testing 
deemed necessary.

278 STUDY PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS
8.1 Clinical Evaluations
Medical History:  Study personnel will take the medical history of all subjects. This history will 
include significant medical disorders of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, mouth, cardiovascular 
system, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas, kidney, nervous system, blood, lymph 
glands, endocrine system, musculoskeletal system, skin, and genital/reproductive tract.  It will 
also include a history of allergies, cancer, immunodeficiency, psychiatric illness, substance 
abuse, and autoimmune disease.  Patients will also be queried regarding any previous influenza 
vaccinations, the date and source of vaccine, and the type of vaccine administered.  Each 
subject’s NYSIIS record will also be accessed to assess for vaccination history by [CONTACT_25617].
Medication History:  Study personnel will record all medications, including prescription and 
over-the-counter drugs (such as vitamins, minerals, supplements, homeopathic preparations 
and/or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), taken by [CONTACT_29276] 30 days prior to enrollment.
Targeted Physical Examination:  Licensed study clinicians (i.e., physician, physician’s assistant, 
and study nurses) will obtain a subject’s weight and vital signs (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse, and 
temperature) and a targeted physical examination will be conducted if necessary.  This targeted 
physical examination will focus on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_494660].  In 
subjects enrolled through the ED, this information may be obtained through a review of the 
medical record.  
8.2 Laboratory Evaluations/Assays
8.2.1 Specimen Collection, Preparation, Handling and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_494661]:  A weight-based sample of whole blood will be collected, if able, by [CONTACT_494712], with 
the blood volume determined as described in Table 1.  This sample will then be transferred to 
appropriate-sized tubes containing heparin or sodium citrate.  If blood is available, a sample of 
fresh blood in sodium citrate tubes will be shipped to our collaborators at University of Chicago 
overnight using appropriate biosafety precautions to enable quantification, isolation, and 
determination of the BCR repertoire of plasmablasts.  All other blood will be centrifuged and 
plasma and PBMCs will be isolated within several hours of the blood being obtained (blood is 
stable in heparinized tubes for at least [ADDRESS_636294] draw).  Plasma will be aliquoted and stored in 
an Ultra Low Temp Freezer at ≤ -70oC  for use in ELISA, antibody array, and 
microneutralization assays.  PBMCs will be washed, counted, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for 
later use in intracellular cytokine staining, multiplex cytokine assays, RNA-seq, and CD4 T cell 
and memory B cell Elispot assays, with a subset of PBMCs sent to our collaborators NIAID for 
further analysis.  If blood cannot be successfully obtained, this will be documented on the 
enrollment or case report form as “unable to be obtained.”  In the event that the child is unwilling 
to cooperate with research staff or attempts to draw blood are unsuccessful, the research staff 
may forego further intervention procedures for the given study visit. If the child and parent/LAR

28are willing to participate further, then follow up visits will be scheduled and attempted as 
outlined in the timeline. 
All blood will be drawn by [CONTACT_494682], with pain 
minimized through comforting and distraction techniques.  Only the minimum amount of blood 
necessary to achieve the study objectives will be obtained, with the blood volume being within a 
level accepted as safe (Table 1).  As a child’s total blood volume is related to body weight, we 
have chosen a weight based approach to determine the maximum volume of blood to be 
obtained.  This will allow us to optimize our likelihood of being able to accomplish the study 
objectives while still prioritizing the safety of the child.  Current policy suggests that blood 
volume limits between 1% and 5% of the total blood volume on a single draw and up to 10% of 
total blood volume over an 8 week period will present minimal risk to children [31].  A child’s 
total blood volume estimated at around 80 mL/kg.  The proposed blood draws in this protocol 
impose a maximum upper limit of 1 mL/kg on any single draw (about 1.25% of estimated TBV), 
with a maximum of 3 mL/kg (about 3.75% of estimated TBV) over any 8 week period for 
pediatric patients.  This volume remains well below the upper limit of 10% of total blood volume 
in an 8 week period and is consistent with the available evidence on what will present minimal 
risk to children while still providing enough PBMCs to perform the in depth analysis of CD4 T 
cell and B cell specificity and functional capacity and evaluation of antibody responses required 
for this study.  
Nasal swab:  Nasal swabs will be obtained by [CONTACT_494713]-sterilized soft nylon flocked 
swabs into alternate nostrils of the subject and gently rotating them across the mucosa to collect 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_171919].  When appropriate, one of these swabs will be used to perform a rapid 
influenza test in the primary care office, URMC or RGH ED, the VRU, or the subject’s home.   TABLE 1.  BLOOD VOLUMES (mL) IN CHILDREN

29The other swab will be placed into 1 mL of viral culture transport media for RT-PCR studies and 
stored in an Ultra Low Temp Freezer at ≤ -70oC.  
Nasal wash:  Between 1.5 and 5 mL of sterile saline will be instilled and collected, if able, by 
[CONTACT_494714] a flexible catheter or bulb syringe inserted approximately 5 cm into the naris.  
Alternatively, we may opt to instill the entire volume into a single nostril, as this is considered 
safe and the anticipation of the 2nd nasal wash has been significantly distressing to some children 
[34].  In the event that the child is unwilling to cooperate with research staff or attempts to 
collect the nasal wash are unsuccessful, the research staff may forego further intervention 
procedures for the given study visit. If the child and parent/LAR are willing to participate 
further, then follow up visits will be scheduled and attempted as outlined in the timeline. Within 
several hours, the nasal wash fluid will be centrifuged to pellet the cells and the supernatant will 
be removed and stored in an Ultra Low Temp Freezer at ≤ -70oC .  The cell pellet will be 
washed, after which any cells obtained will be counted and frozen in liquid nitrogen for later 
analysis. 
Nasal Brush: A UV-sterilized pediatric flocked swab will be used to collect inferior turbinate 
nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_494662]-wide expression analysis.  The brush specimen will be obtained, 
if able, immediately following the NW in order to obtain mucosal lining cells free of mucus and 
lymphocytes. The swab will be placed in the nostril and rotated with an up and down motion 
gently against the lining mucosa for ~ [ADDRESS_636295] (Qiagen) and transported to the lab for RNA isolation, which will be completed 
within a 1 week time period.  Recovered RNA will be stored in an an Ultra Low Temp Freezer at 
≤ -70oC until use.
8.2.2 Laboratory Evaluations
Detection and quantification of influenza virus:  Influenza will be detected from potentially 
infected subjects by (1) rapid antigen testing using a commercial assay (BinaxNOW, Alere, 
Waltham, MA or QuickVue Influenza A+B test, Quidel, San Diego, CA) and (2) real time RT-
PCR using primers obtained from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA) or using the ABI [ADDRESS_636296] and quantify influenza viral load.  This sample will be 
stored and may be used to sequence the infecting influenza virus at a later time point.  
 
Multiparameter flow cytometry:  PBMCs will be thawed, rested overnight, and, when 
appropriate, stimulated with influenza-specific peptide pools as experimental antigens, 
Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (a superantigen) as a positive control, or a pool of irrelevant 
peptides from the Sin Nombre virus glycoprotein precursor protein or media alone as a negative 
control for 10-[ADDRESS_636297] and modify these panels as necessary to optimize

30our staining results.  
Multiplex cytokine assay:  Multiplex cytokine assays will be used to determine the antigen-
specific cytokine production potential of the total CD4 T cell population.  Cells will be thawed, 
rested overnight, and depleted of CD8 and NK cells.  They then will be stimulated with HA and NP peptide pools or irrelevant peptides as a negative control.  Following around 48 hours of coculture, supernatants will be assayed for levels of 30 common cytokines and chemokines with a human cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and analyzed on a Bio-Plex200 system.
Peptide-specific CD4 T cell Elispot:  IFN γ, IL-2, and granzyme B Elispot analysis of human 
PBMCs will be performed by [CONTACT_494715].  Briefly, PBMC will be thawed, rested 
overnight, and depleted of CD8 and NK cells.  They then will be cultured for 16-48 hours in Millipore 96-well PVDF plates coated with capture antibodies for either IFNElispot  analysis of 
human PBMCs will be performed by [CONTACT_494715].  Briefly, PBMC will be thawed, rested overnight, and depleted
Detection of memory B cells:  With collaborators at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster, the method of 
Crotty and colleagues [35] will be adapted to determine frequencies of influenza-specific 
memory B cells.  Cultured cells will be non-specifically stimulated by a mixture of mitogens, followed by [CONTACT_33821], NP, and Ig Elispots for determination of (i) antigen-specific IgG ASC frequencies, and (ii) total IgG ASC frequencies.  Antigen-specific MBC frequencies will be expressed as the percentage of antigen-specific IgG ASC/total IgG ASC.  
RNA-seq:   Total RNA will be extracted from PBMCs.  This RNA will then be provided to the 
genomics core for construction of a cDNA library and high-throughput sequencing using an 
Illumina HiSeq [ADDRESS_636298]’s prior influenza exposure.  
Evaluation for cross reactive HA antibody by [CONTACT_73878]:   With collaborators at the University of 
[COMPANY_002]ster, dilutions of serum will be applied to a chip coated with multiple HA proteins in 
microarray format [36] or evaluated using a Luminex-based technology [37] to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_494663]:   MDCK cells will be grown to confluence in a [ADDRESS_636299] serum dilution able to prevent MDCK cell infection.
ELISA:   Plates will be coated with HA or NP protein and then incubated with dilutions of serum.  
After washing and blocking nonspecific binding, plates are incubated with a horseradish 
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody and developed with 3,3’,5,5’-
tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride substrate with absorbance read at 450 nm.  To determine antibody avidity, sera are incubated on a recombinant HA-coated plate in the presence of serial

31dilutions of sodium thiocyanate.  The serum avidity is defined as the concentration of sodium 
thiocyanate that induces 50% inhibition of antibody binding.  
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR):  SPR measures the off rate (rate at which antibodies 
dissociate from the antigen) of antibody-antigen binding.  The off rates provide a measure of 
how well the antibodies bind, indicating their quality. In an ideal immune response to vaccine, 
the off rates should go down, indicating an improved recognition of antigen.  For these studies, 
collaborators at the FDA will use recombinant influenza hemagglutinins that match that year’s 
vaccine formulation, as well as HA head only and HA stalk only recombinant proteins to 
measure antibody off rates. 
Isolation of Influenza-Specific Monoclonal Antibodies:  We will send fresh blood samples to the 
University of Chicago at the baseline visit and days 8+2 and 24 +/- [ADDRESS_636300]-vaccination or 
infection in study years 1 and 2 and plasmablasts (day 8) and antigen-specific memory B cells

cloned variable genes of single cells and the antibodies and serum will be tested for binding, 
neutralization, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_76802].  In addition, BCR repertoire will be determined using the 
10x genomics platform.
Systems Biology Approaches:  We will be sending PBMCs to the NIAID Systems Genomics and 
Bioinformatics Unit to better understand immune development in childhood.  Using a 
combination of approaches including flow cytometry,  an analysis of cellular transcriptional 
activity in immune cell subset and single cells as analyzed by [CONTACT_16638]-seq or microarrays, PBMC 
transcriptome analysis, and additional ‘omics” assays for assessing immune receptor repertoires 
including TCR and BCR profiling, the state of the immune system both at baseline and following 
immune perturbations will be assessed.

instructions and safety precautions.
As Quadrivalent Fluzone is a licensed vaccine, NIAID does not expect that any new vaccine 
related safety signal will be detected in this trial.  Therefore, the only adverse events reported to 
DMID will be adverse events that are reportable to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS).    
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) requires healthcare providers to report to 
VAERS:
Any adverse event listed by [CONTACT_29386] a contraindication to further 
doses of the vaccine; and/or

Data on intermittent illnesses, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], surgeries and other events that are unrelated to 
the study intervention but that may impact the health of the child will be collected from the first 
study visit to study conclusion, as these events may effect the immunologic endpoints of the 
study.  This will include data on upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], febrile illnesses, common 
childhood procedures such as PE tube placement or tonsillectomy & adenoidectomy, and similar 
data.  Collected information will include details on approximate date of onset, approximate date 
of resolution (if known), severity, whether the event was associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_494664], and outcome; relatedness to vaccine will not be captured as these events are expected to

3511 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
11.1 Study Hypothesis
The primary hypothesis being tested in this study is that there will be differences in the 
specificity, magnitude and functionality of CD4 T cell and B cell reactivity in a cohort of young 
children depending on early childhood exposures.   
11.2 Sample Size Considerations
Because the degree of variability in many of the measurements in this study are unknown, 
estimating with precision the correlation of patient characteristics (age and prior vaccination 
history) with outcomes (CD4 T cell response magnitude and function, antibody quality and 
quantity and B cell response) is not possible.  The study will evaluate these outcomes and, if 
trends towards a relationship are discovered, subsequent studies will evaluate these in more 
detail.
11.3 Planned Interim Analyses (if applicable)
No formal interim analysis is planned.  However, assay results will be reviewed as they become 
available
11.3.1 Safety Review 
N/A, no interim analysis of safety is planned.
11.3.2 Immunogenicity or Efficacy Review
N/A, no interim analysis of safety is planned.
11.4 Final Analysis Plan 
Data will be analyzed at the end of the study, with results available for publication at that time.  
A cohort of n=[ADDRESS_636304] vaccination with IIV and 
n=20 children infected with influenza acutely will be recruited for each age cohort. Their T cell 
and antibody responses will be measured at three time points: baseline, day 8, and day [ADDRESS_636305]-
vaccination. We will apply Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk’s test to check the normality. If the data passes the 
normality test, two sample t-tests will be used to detect significant mean difference between the 
children of different ages and flu exposures at each time point. Otherwise, Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test will be used.  For follow up visits, subjects  will be followed longitudinally for one to two 
years with yearly revaccination with IIV. CD4 T cell responses (flow cytometry) and B cell and 
antibody responses will be measured at three time points: prior to IIV re-vaccination, [ADDRESS_636306] (or Kruskal-Wallis test, if the

36normality assumption is rejected) to detect significant group differences at each time point. 
Because multiple response variables are used in this analysis, the p-values will be adjusted by [CONTACT_494716]-Hochberg multiple testing procedure [38] to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at 
the level of 0.05. 
General linear models of difference or fold change in T/B cell response at following time points 
from baseline will be used to explore how childhood exposures affect immune responses over 
time, while controlling potentially confounding variables including age, sex, presence of asthma 
or allergies, or other acute or chronic illnesses and medications that may impact the immune 
response. In addition to time-specific comparisons, the following linear mixed effect model will 
be used to analyze data collected from all time points

In case of high-dimensional data in different scales, standardization will be applied before model fitting 
and variable selection. Variable selection approaches using AIC or BIC criteria will be used to select the 
significant predictors. Penalized-based variable selection procedures such as LASSO [39]  or SCAD 
[40,41] may be used to overcome the drawbacks of ad-hoc methods of stepwise, best subset selection, etc. 
post-hoc.

3914 ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
14.[ADDRESS_636308]
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the principles set 
forth in The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human 
Subjects of Research of the US National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of 
Biomedical and Behavioral Research (April 18, 1979) and codified in 45 CFR Part 46 and/or the 
ICH E6; 62 Federal Regulations [ZIP_CODE] (1997).  
14.[ADDRESS_636309] (RSRB) will review this protocol 
and the associated informed consent documents.  Any amendments to the protocol or consent 
materials must also be approved before they are placed into use unless it is in the best interest of 
the subjects’ safety to implement changes prior to approval.  The UR RSRB operates under U.S. 
Federal-Wide Assurance (FWA) 
Prior to enrollment of subjects into this trial, the approved protocol and the informed consent 
form will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_19821].  Any amendments to the protocol or 
consent materials will also be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_494719].  Notification of the IRB's composition, or the IRB’s Federal-wide Assurance 
number, will be provided.
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be written by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_494665].  The site will submit to the sponsor a 
copy of the IRB letter of approval of the amendment.
14.3 Informed Consent
The parents/LARs of all subjects recruited into this study will provide written informed consent.  
There will be two separate consent forms: a briefer consent for a child presenting with influenza-
like illness to be screened for influenza infection and contact[CONTACT_38435], and a full 
consent form for complete study participation.  In addition after the [ADDRESS_636310] the option to enroll for a additional 1 year 
follow up upon reviewing and signing a “consent for longitudinal follow up.”  To obtain consent, 
a member of the investigative team will meet with potentially interested parents/LARs.  The 
Emergency Department Research Associate (EDRA) Program will be utilized to recruit subjects 
acutely infected with influenza from both the Pediatric Emergency Department and UR-affiliated 
Urgent Care Centers.  The parents or LARs of the subjects will be provided with a description of 
the study, including the purpose, risks, benefits, alternatives, and study procedures.  The fact that 
there is no requirement for participation and that subjects are free to withdraw at any time will be 
stressed.   All questions that arise during this discussion will be answered.  Parents or LARs will 
then be provided with a copy of the consent form to read.  If they agree to study participation, 
written informed consent will be obtained by a certified study team member or a member of the 
EDRA Program.  A study assent form will also be reviewed with children ≥8 years of age and

40signed.  Once the consent and assent (as necessary) forms are signed, the subject will be 
considered enrolled in the study and subject information and samples will be obtained.  A copy 
of the signed consent form will be provided to the parent/LAR.   
Parents/LARs who initially sign the briefer consent form to have their children screened for 
influenza will be given the opportunity to consent to participation in the full study if their child 
screens positive for influenza.  At that point, they will have the full study explained in detail and 
will again be given the opportunity to have any questions they have answered.  There will not be 
a requirement to participate in the full study if consent for influenza testing is given and the child 
screens positive for infection.  
14.4 Informed Consent Process
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continuing throughout the individual’s study participation.  As all participants in 
this study will be children, informed consent will be sought from the study participant’s parent or 
LAR (although subjects will provide assent as appropriate for age).  The risks and possible 
benefits of this study will be discussed extensively with parents/LARs and participants as 
appropriate.  Consent forms describing in detail the study interventions/products, study 
procedures, and risks are given to the parent/LAR, with written documentation of informed 
consent required prior to starting intervention/administering study product.  Consent forms will 
be IRB-approved and the participant/representative will be asked to read and review the 
document.  Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will explain the research study to the 
participant’s representative and the participant and answer any questions that may arise.  The 
parent/LAR will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done 
specifically for the study and assent from the study participant will be obtained if the subject is [ADDRESS_636311] the opportunity to discuss the study with their 
parents/LARs or think about it prior to agreeing to participate.  The parent/LAR may withdraw 
consent at any time throughout the course of the study.  A copy of the informed consent 
document will be given to the participating parents/LARs for their records.  The rights and 
welfare of the children will be protected by [CONTACT_309466].
At the time the study staff seek informed consent, the study worker will ask the eligible 
participant’s parent/LAR if he/she is literate.  If the representative reports he or she is not literate, 
then the study staff will request that a witness be present while the study worker reads and 
explains the study and what participation will entail.  If the eligible subject’s representative 
agrees to study participation, he or she will make a mark on the signature [CONTACT_494724].  The witness will also sign and date the form, if the witness is confident that the participant 
has understood the explanation and is participating willingly.  In addition, the witness will 
complete the date line for the participant.
14.4.1 Informed Consent/Assent Process (in Case of a Minor)
Appropriate consent will be obtained from all subjects prior to any study related procedures (see 
above).  Parents/LARs of eligible subjects will sign informed consent.  Children and adolescents

41ages 8 years and older will also sign an assent document after consent is obtained from a parent 
or LAR.  
14.5 Exclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children (Special Populations)
As this is a study of the development of immunity in children, all participants will be minors.  
There will be no exclusions based on race or ethnicity.

and the sponsor(s) and their agents.  This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of 
biological specimens in addition to the clinical information relating to participants.
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in 
strict confidence.  No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.
The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all documents 
and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, medical 
records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study.  The 
clinical study site will permit access to such records.  A representative from the University of 
[COMPANY_002]ster IRB may also have access to the subject’s record. 
To protect privacy, the NIH has provided a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC).  With this CoC, 
the participating sites cannot be forced to release information that may identify the participant, 
even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, 
or other proceedings.  The participating sites will use the CoC to resist any demands for 
information that would identify the participant, except as explained below.
The CoC cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the [LOCATION_002] 
Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects, like this study, or 
local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases.
A CoC does not prevent the participant from voluntarily releasing information about themselves 
or their involvement in this research.  If any person or agency obtains a written consent to 
receive study information, then the participating sites may not use the CoC to withhold that 
information.  
The CoC does not prevent the participating sites from reporting without the participant’s consent 
information that would identify the subject as a participant in the study regarding matters that 
must be legally reported including: child and elder abuse, sexual abuse, or wanting to harm 
themselves or others.

to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  When making changes or corrections, the original entry 
will be crossed out with a single line, initialed and dated. The original text will not be erased, 
overwritten, or altered with correction fluid or tape on the original.
15.1 Data Management Responsibilities
All source documents and laboratory reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_328284], who will ensure that they are accurate and complete.  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff at the site under the supervision of 
the clinical PIs.  During the study, the investigators will maintain complete and accurate 
documentation for the study.
15.2 Data Capture Methods
Clinical data will be initially recorded on paper source documents, and then transferred to 
electronic case report forms (eCRF) within BLIS.  Source documents will be retained for 
monitoring purposes in a secure location.  Laboratory data will be directly entered into BLIS 
from laboratory notebooks or computer databases.  
As detailed in the CEIRS contract, overall CEIRS data sharing will adhere to the following 
schedule: 
Sequence data: provided to Data Processing Coordinating Center within 45 days
Surveillance data: provided to Data Processing Coordinating Center within 12 months
Virus phenotypic data: provided to Data Processing Coordinating Center within 12 months
Basic research data: provided to Data Processing Coordinating Center within [ADDRESS_636315]’s previous history of influenza exposure influences future vaccine responses.  Although 
we will not be testing for any specific diseases or conditions as part of this study, it is possible 
that genetic information regarding disease susceptibility will be obtained.  As we will be 
examining expression levels of a multitude of mRNAs, there will be a low level of certainty that 
any obtained results are predictive of either the presence of or susceptibility to any disease.  
Thus, these results will be held in confidence and not released to the subject, placed in their 
medical record, or provided to any individual or organization.  
15.4 Timing/Reports
The final report will include a comprehensive analysis of the data.

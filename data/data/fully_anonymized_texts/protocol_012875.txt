STUDY S CHEMA  
 
This is a Phase II, multi -institution study entitled, “Phase II study of Atezolizumab and 
Bevacizumab in Patients with Recurrent, Persistent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer.”  In this study, 
patients with recurre nt, persistent or metastatic cervical cancer who have received one  to two  prior 
therap ies in the recurrent, persistent or metastatic disease setting will be treated with the 
combination of bevacizumab 15mg/kg intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks and atezolizumab  1200mg 
IV every 3 weeks until progression of disease (POD), unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from 
study.  All treatments will be administered in the outpatient setting.  The primary objective is to 
measure the objective response rate (ORR, either parti al or complete response) defined by [CONTACT_393] 
v1.1 criteria.  Secondary endpoints include progression -free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) 
and safety.

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease(s)  
 
2.1.1 Cervical Cancer  
 
In the [LOCATION_002], it  is estimated that 12,990 women will be diagnosed with cervical 
cancer and 4,120 women will die of the disease in 2016 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26742998 ).  Worldwide, cervical cancer is the 
fourth most common cancer and the most common cause of mortality in women, with 
528,000 new cases and an estimated 266,000 deaths in 2012 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220842 ). 
 
The human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) is recognized to be the primary etiologic agent for 
cervical carcinogenesis.  However, the majority of HPV -infected individuals have an 
asymptomatic course, with clearance of the virus occurring within 1 or 2  years in 90% of 
cases.  Ten percent of individuals experience persistent HPV infection, which increases 
their risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_33919].  Ultimately, approxi mately one half of the 10% 
of individuals with persistent HPV infection will develop malignant disease, a process 
that may take up to 30 years (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21282563).  Although 
many HPV types have been associated with cervical neoplasia, types  16, [ADDRESS_33338] invasive cancers and are considered “high -risk” HPV -
genotypes.  HPV -16 accounts for approximately 53% of invasive cervical cancer cases in 
most countries, followed by [CONTACT_33968] -18, which accounts for approximately  13% 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19318628).  The high -risk HPV genotypes

 produce 2  oncoproteins, designated E6  and E7, which bind and inactivate the tumor 
suppressor’s p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRB), respectively.  The E6 mediated 
inhibition of p53 blocks apoptosis, whereas E7 inhibition of pRB abrogates cell cycle 
arrest leading to dysregulated cellular proliferation and ultimately malignancy 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12502868 ). 
 
Outcomes for patients with recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical cancer are poor.  
First-line therapy with bevac izumab in combination with paclitaxel/cisp latin or 
paclitaxel/topotecan i s been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) based 
on GOG 240 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552320 ).  Treatment with this 
combination increased overall survival from 13.3 to 17 months, (HR 0.71 [98% CI, 0 .54-
0.95; p=0.004]), and the ORR increased from 36 to 48% (p=0.008) when compared to 
chemotherapy without bevacizumab.  Seventy -five percent of patients entering GOG240 
had prior concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CCRT) with cisplatin.  The 
remaining 25% were treatment naïve.  Following this first line treatment with 
chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, there is no usual care second line therapy 
with significant activity.  In GOG 227C, a phase II study of single agent bevacizumab  (in 
patien ts without prior bevacizumab) , treatment was shown to be well -tolerated and active 
in the second and third -line treatment of patients with recurrent cervical cancer (23.9% 
PFS at 6  months and 10.9% response rate, n= 46 patients) 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19139430 ). 
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_33339] a lower median mutational burden than other checkpoint -blockade 
sensitive malignancies (range of approximately 1 -10 mutations per megabase, as 
compared to 1 to 100 in melanoma, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23945592). To 
increas e the proportion of benefiting patients, cervical cancer must be made “visible” to 
the immune system, which may require targeting of disease specific immune targets 
and/or target enhancement through judicious combinations.  Strategies to improve activity 
of PD-L1/PD -1 blockade include immune combinations (e.g., CTLA4/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), 
chemotherapy combinations and targeted therapy combinations (e.g., anti -vascular).  
 
Results to date show modest activity for single agent  anti-PD-1 and anti -CTLA4 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  A stu dy of single agent anti -PD-1 treatment with nivolumab in recurrent, 
persistent or metastatic cervix cancer has completed accrual and is in follow -up (NRG 
GY002, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , n=26 patients .  A phase I/II study of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_33920].  Preliminary results of 42 enrolled 
patients, presented at ASCO 2015 , showed one confirmed partial response ( J Clin Oncol 
33, 2015 (suppl; abstr 3061)).  Cervical squamous cell cancer is under evaluation in the 
Phase Ib  KEYNOTE -028 study (pembrolizumab).  Preliminary results presented at ASCO 
2016 show ORR of 12.5% (3/24) ( J Clin Oncol 34, 2016 (suppl; abstr 5515)) .  Further 
evaluation of pembrolizumab is planned in the KEYNOTE -158 study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
Evaluation of com binations holds promise.  A study of nivolumab and nivolumab plus 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_33921] -associated tumors ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is ongoing.  SWOG is planning a 
trial of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_33922] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ),

 that will include c ervical cancer, vaginal cancer and vulvar cancer cohorts.  
 
2.1.3 Rationale for Atezolizumab in Advanced Cervix Cancers  
 
Given the parallels in disease pathoge nesis and treatment between HPV associated cervix 
and head and neck cancers (HNSCC), their comparison ma y be informative. Promising 
data from HNSCC suggest that checkpoint blockade therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33923].   
 
PD-L1 has been found to be upregulated in cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_33924] (CINs) 
(20/21 cases) and cervical squamous cell can cers (56/70) relative to normal cervical 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603] (0/55) ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26403783 ).  While one study 
found PD -L1 expression to be associated with HPV positivity 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23521696 ), in another 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19825956 ), PD -L1 was only expressed in 19% of  
cervical carcinomas; however, a tissue microarray was used for this study which may 
underestimate PD -L1 prevalence in a given sample. PD -L1 expression does not appear to 
be different between HPV (+) and ( -) oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511814 ).  Nonetheless, the success of TIL 
therapy in a small study of HPV (+) patients (ORR 3/9 with 2 CRs, 
http://www .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25823737) suggests that there is potential for an 
effective anti -tumor T cell response in this disease.  
 
In terms of the clinical significance of HPV positivity, in HNSCC, a histo ry of infection 
may impact long term outcome but no t response rate to checkpoint blockade.  This could 
be, in part, due to the fact that most HPV ( -) HNSCC are associated with cigarette 
exposure, and thus tumors are likely to have a higher mutational burden.  In a Phase IB 
study of pembrolizumab at 10mg/kg  q2 weeks in patients with HNSCC, the ORR was 
20% overall and 50% in the 12 patients with high  PD-L1 expression (Chow LQ et al Ann 
Oncol  25(suppl  4):S1–S41).  The ORR was 4/23 (20%) in the HPV (+) patients, and 7/38 
(19%) in HPV ( -).  However, the PFS and OS were longer in HPV positive patients: PFS 
(95% CI) of 17.1 (8 -41.7) vs 8.1 (7.9 -15.6) weeks in HPV (+) versus HPV ( -), and OS of 
not reached (9.6 -NR) vs.  9.5 (3.9 -12.6) weeks in HPV (+) versus HPV ( -), respectively.  
While it is not possible to ascertain whether the drug or inherent disease behavior was 
responsible for this difference, it is nonetheless promising that those patients with HPV+ 
disease fared  better.   
 
In a study of pembrolizumab in HNSCC, of 99 evaluable patients, the RR was 24.8% with 
an additional 24.8% of patients having stable disease, yielding a DCR o f 49.6% (Seiwart 
et al J Clin On col Vol 33, 2015).  In that study, the response rate wa s slightly lower in 
HPV (+) patients (20.6%, 95% CI 8.7 -37.9) compared to HPV ( -) (27.2%, 95% CI 17.9 -
38.2).  This study did not report PFS/OS in HPV (+) versus negative patients.  In another 
study of MEDI4736 in 62 pat ients with HNSCC, the ORR was 11 % (18% in PD -L1 
positive tumors ; 8% in PD -L1 negative tumors)  (Segal et al J Clin Oncol 33, 2015) , and 
was not different between HPV (+) and ( -) patients.

 2.2 CTEP  IND Agent  
 
2.2.1 Atezolizumab ( MPDL3280A)  
 
Atezolizumab ( MPDL3280A ) is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody 
consisting of two heavy chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214  amino  acids) 
and is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  
Atezolizumab was engineered to e liminate Fc -effector function via a  single amino acid 
substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position [ADDRESS_33340] ed concentrations in humans.  Atezolizumab targets human 
programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) and inhibits its interaction with its receptor, 
programmed death -1 (PD -1).  Atezolizumab also blocks the binding of PD -L1 to B7.1, an 
interaction that is reported to  provide additional inhibitory signals to T  cells.  
 
Atezolizumab is being investigated as a potential therapy against solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies in  humans.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mechanism of Action  
 
PD-L1 expression is prevalent in many human tumors ( e.g., lung, bladder, ovarian, 
melanoma, colon carcinoma), and its overexpression has been associated with poor 
prognosis in patients with several cancers (Thompson et al. , 2006; Hamanashi et al. , 
2007; Okazaki and Honjo 2007; Hino et al. , 2010).  PD-L1 binds t o two known inhibitory 
receptors expressed on activated T cells (PD -1 and B7.1), and receptor expression is 
sustained in states of chronic stimulation such as chronic infection or cancer (Blank et al. , 
2005; Keir et al. , 2008).  Ligation of PD -L1 with PD -1 or B7.1 inhibits T -cell 
proliferation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity, leading to the functional 
inactivation or inhibition of T cells.  Aberrant expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells has 
been reported to impede anti -tumor immunity, resulting in  immune evasion (Blank and 
Mackensen , 2007).  Therefore, interruption of the PD -L1/PD -1 and PD -L1/B7.[ADDRESS_33341] 
represents  an attractive strategy to reinvigorate tumor -specific T -cell immunity.  
 
Unlike PD -L1, programmed death -ligand 2 ( PD-L2) is primarily expressed  in normal 
tissues  such as the lung.  As a result , targeting  tumor -overexpressed  PD-L1 is a more 
promising strategy than targeting PD -1, as it preserves the  immune homeostatic PD -
L2:PD -1 interaction in normal tissues while dually inhibiting the  PD-L1:PD -1 and PD -
L1:B7.1 pathways to enhance anti -tumor T cell  immunity.  
 
Blockade of PD -L1 or PD -1 with monoclonal antibodies has been reported to result in  
strong and often rapid antitumor effects in several mouse tumor models (Iwai et al. , 2002;  
Strome et al., 2003).  These data suggest that tumor -specific T cells may be present in  the 
tumor microenvironment in an inactive or inhibited state, and blockade of the  PD-L1/PD -
[ADDRESS_33342] can reinvigorate tumor -specific T -cell responses.  
 
Collectively, these data establish the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_33343] as a promising new  
therapeutic target in patients with advanced tumors.  Immune -related adverse events

 (AEs) reported from the two recent studies were consistent with the role of the PD-
L1/PD -[ADDRESS_33344] in regulating peripheral tolerance.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of Nonclinical Experience  
 
The safety, pharmacokinetics  (PK) , and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab were investigated 
in mice and cynomolgus monkeys to support intravenous (IV) administration and  to aid in 
projecting the appropriate starting dose in humans.  Given the similar binding of 
atezolizumab for cynomolgus monkey and human PD -L1, the cynomolgus monkey was 
selected as the primary and relevant nonclinical model for understanding the safety, PK, 
and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab .  
 
Overall, the nonclinical PK and toxicokinetics observed for atezolizumab supported entry 
into clinical studies, including providing adequate safety factors for the proposed phase 1 
starting doses.  The results of t he toxicology program were consistent with the anticipated 
pharmacologic activity of down -modulating the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_33345] and supported 
entry into clinical trials in patients.  
 
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclini cal studies.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of Clinical Experience  
 
Current clinical studies of atezolizumab include one ongoing phase 1a monotherapy 
study, three ongoing combination studies, five phase 2 studies, and one phase 3 study.  
Details of all ongoing studies can be fo und in the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Clinical PK and Immunogenicity  
 
On the basis of available preliminary PK data (0.03 −20 mg/kg), atezolizumab shows  
linear PK at doses ≥1 mg/kg (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  At doses ≥1 mg/kg, the 
mean maximum plasma concentration (C max) increased in a dose -proportional mann er and 
was 26.0 mcg/mL for the 1 mg/kg dose group and 472 mcg/mL for the 20  mg/kg dose 
group.  Similarly, at doses ≥1 mg/kg, the group mean area under the conc entration -time 
curve from time zero  extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf) had a range of 340  to 6050 day × 
mcg/mL and was approximately dose proportional, as evidenced by [CONTACT_33969] 
(CL) across the dose range.  For the 1 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose groups, the mean 
apparent CL and the mean steady -state volume of distribution (V ss) had a range of 3.20 to 
4.44 mL/day/kg and 48.1 to 65.7 mL/kg, respectively, which is consistent  with the 
expected profile of an IgG1 antibody in humans.  
 
The development of anti -therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) has been observed in patients in 
all dose cohorts and was associated with changes in PK for some patients in the lower 
dose cohorts (0.3, 1, an d 3 mg/kg) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  Patients dosed at the 
10-, 15-, and 20 -mg/kg dose levels maintained the expected target trough levels of drug 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_33384].  Accordingly, the development of detectable ATAs does 
not appear to ha ve a clinically significant impact on PK for doses from 10 to 20 mg/kg.  
To date, no relationship between the development of measurable ATAs and safety or

[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Clinical Safety Summary  
 
As of [ADDRESS_33346] received atezolizumab in clinical trial participation as a single agent or 
in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy.   
 
Safety findings of single -agent atezolizumab across  multiple tumor types in the clinical 
development program are consistent with the known mechanism of action of 
atezolizumab and the underlying disease.  Overall, treatment with atezolizumab is well 
tolerated, with a manageable adverse event profile.  Curre ntly, no maximum tolerated 
dose, no dose -limiting toxicities, and no clear dose -related trends in the incidence of 
adverse events have been determined.  Across all studies and tumor types, the most 
commonly reported adverse events with single -agent atezoli zumab include fatigue, 
nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhea, constipation, and cough.   
 
The adverse events  observed  with atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and/or 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33925].  Systemic 
immune activation, characterized by [CONTACT_33970], is a potential risk 
associated with atezolizumab when used in combination w ith another immunomodulating 
compound.  
 
The percentage of patients who discontinued atezolizumab due to any adverse event is 
consistent when used as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy (e.g., 5.4% 
in Study PCD4989g and 5.8% in Study  GP28328,  respectively).  The percentage of 
patients with any Grade 5 adverse event was similar when used as a single agent or in 
combination with chemotherapy (e.g., 1.6% in Study PCD4989g and 1.0% in 
Study  GP28328).        
 
Immune -related adverse events are consi stent with the role of the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_33347] in 
regulating peripheral tolerance.  Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, events 
associated with inflammation and/or immune -related adverse events are closely 
monitored during the atezolizumab clinica l program. To date immune -related adverse 
events associated with atezolizumab include hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, 
diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, Guillain -Barré 
syndrome, myasthenic syndrome/mya sthenia gravis, and meningoencephalitis.  Immune -
related adverse events and guidance regarding the management of immune -related 
adverse events are provided below:  
 
Management of Atezolizumab -Specific Adverse Events  
 
Toxicities associated or possibly associ ated with atezolizumab treatment should be 
managed according to standard medical practice.  Additional tests, such as autoimmune 
serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic etiology.

[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Immune -Related Adverse Events  
 
Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab , events associated with inflammation 
and/or immune -mediated AEs have been closely monitored during the atezolizumab 
clinical program (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015).  These include potential dermatologic, 
hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_33926]/elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and influenza -like illness.  Expected adverse 
drug reactions associated with atezolizumab include the following:  
hepatitis/transaminitis, hypothyroidism, infusion -related react ions (IRRs), pneumonitis, 
influenza -like illness, and dermatologic reactions.  Potential adverse drug reactions 
include the following:  ATAs, colitis, endocrine disorders, hypersensitivity, neurologic 
disorders, and pericardial effusion.   Pericardial and p leural involvement with associated 
effusions is common in patients with cancer and has the theoretical potential to be 
exacerbated by [CONTACT_33971] -L1 
blockade.  Dyspnea, cough, fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary infiltrates have 
been associated with the administration of atezolizumab and have primarily been 
observed in patients with underlying NSCLC.  
 
For further details, see the most recent Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Clinical Efficacy Su mmary  
 
Patients with multiple tumor types were included in study PCD4989g , with the largest 
cohorts consisting of patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), renal cell 
carcinoma ( RCC ), and bladder cancer  (Investigator’s Brochure, 2015) .  Objective 
responses with atezolizumab monotherapy were observed in a broad range of 
malignancies, including NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, urothelial bladder cancer  (UBC) , 
colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer , and sarcoma.  
Objective r esponse s were recorded for 20 of 88 (22.7%) response -evaluable patients with 
NSCLC, including responses in squamous and non -squamous patients (4/21 and 16/67 , 
respectively).  A total of 8 of the 20 responding NSCLC patients continued to respond at 
the time of the  clinical data cutoff .   
 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33349] been performed for study PCD4989g , including expansion 
cohorts of patients with NSCLC (88 efficacy -evaluable patients), UBC (87 efficacy -
evaluable patients) , and RCC (62 efficacy -evaluable patients)  (Powles et al., 2014; Herbst 
et al., 201 4; Investigator’s Brochure, 2015 ).  Preliminary results suggest that PD -L1 
expression in tumor -infiltrating  T cells is likely to be assoc iated with response to 
atezolizumab .  An objective response rate (ORR) of 43% (13 of 30 patients, including 2 
complete responses) was observed in UBC patients with tumor -infiltrating immune cells 
with PD-L1 immunohistochemistr y (IHC) scores of 2 or 3, whereas the ORR among IHC 
0/1 UBC patients was 11% (4 of 35) (Powles et al., 2014).  While the median had not 
been reached as of January 1, 2014, the duration of response ranged from 0.1+ to 30.3+ 
weeks for patients with IHC 2/3 t umor -infiltrating immune population s and from 0.1+ to 
6.0+ weeks for patients with IHC 0/1.  Response to atezolizumab in the UBC cohort was 
associated with the tumor -infiltrating immune cell IHC scores ( P=0.026) but not with 
tumor cell IHC scores ( P=0.93).   Similarly, a preliminary analysis of the NSCLC cohort 
(53 evaluable patients) and the total patient population (175 evaluable patients) of 
PCD4989g found that response  was significantly associated  with PD-L1 IHC score in 
tumor -infiltrating immune cells ( P=0.015 in NSCLC, P=0.007 in all tumors) but not with 
IHC score in tumor cells ( P=0.920 in NSCLC, P=0.079 in all tumors)  (Herbst et al., 
2014).   Eighty -three percent of NSCLC patients with an IHC score of 3 (tumor -infiltrating 
immune cell) responded to treatment, whereas 43% of NSCLC patients with IHC 2  were  
limited to disease stabilization.  
 
2.2.2 Bevacizumab  
 
Bevacizumab  is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds all 
biologically active isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF, or 
VEGF -A) with high affinity (K d=1.1 nM) (Presta et al., 1997) .  The antibody consists of a 
human IgG1 framework and the antigen -binding complementarity -determining regions 
from the murine anti -VEGF MAb A.4.6.1  (AvastinTM [bevac izumab] Investigators 
Brochure, 2008; Kim et al., 1993; Presta et al., 1997).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mechanism of Action  
 
Of known proangiogenic factors, VEGF is one of the most potent and specific, and has 
been identified as a crucial regulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis. 
VEGF is a secreted, heparin -binding protein that exists in multiple isoforms.  Action of 
VEGF is primarily mediated through binding to the receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR -1 
(Flt-1) and VEGFR -2 (KDR/Flk -1).  The biological effects of VEGF inc lude endothelial 
cell mitogenesis and migration, increased vascular permeability, induction of proteinases 
leading to remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and suppression of dendritic cell 
maturation. Neutralization of VEGF by A.4.6.1 or bevacizumab has  been shown to inhibit 
the VEGF -induced proliferation of human endothelial cells  in vitro , and decrease 
microvessel density and interstitial pressure in tumor xenografts  in vivo . In patients, 
preliminary results from a neoadjuvant trial in rectal cancer demonstrated a decrease in 
blood perfusion/permeability and interstitial fluid pressure in tumors after one dose of 
bevacizumab (Willett et al. , 2004) .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical Studies  
 
The murine parent MAb of bevacizumab, A4.6.1, has demonstrated potent growth 
inhibition in vivo  in a variety of human ca ncer xenograft and metastasis models, including 
those for SK -LMS -1 leiomyosarcoma, G55 glioblastoma multiforme, A673 
rhabdomyosarcoma, Calu -6, and MCF -7 cell lines (Borgstrom et al. , 1999; Kabbinavar, 
1995; Kim et al. , 1993; Presta et al. , 1997).  The anti tumor activity was enhanced with the 
combination of A4.6.1 and chemotherapeutic agents compared to either agent alone.  
Combined blockage of the VEGF and other growth factor pathways ( e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_33927] [EGFR] or Platelet Derived Growth  Factor Receptor [PDGFR]) 
has also demonstrated additive effects in vivo  (Bergers et al. , 2003; Shaheen et al. , 2001) . 
Associated with the anti -tumor activity of anti -VEGF MAbs were findings of reduced 
intratumoral endothelial cells and microcapi[INVESTIGATOR_33928] . 
   
Nonclinical toxicology studies have examined the effects of bevacizumab on female 
reproductive function, fetal develo pment, and wound healing.  Fertility may be impaired 
in cynomolgus monkeys administered bevacizumab, which led to reduced endometrial 
proliferation and uterine weight as well as a decrease in ovarian weight and number of 
corpora lutea.  Bevacizumab is tera togenic in rabbits, with increased frequency of fetal 
resorption, and specific gross and skeletal alterations. In juvenile cynomolgus monkeys 
with open growth plates, bevacizumab induced physeal dysplasia which was partially 
reversible upon cessation of th erapy.  Bevacizumab also delays the rate of wound healing 
in rabbits, and this effect appeared to be dose -dependent and characterized by a reduction 
of wound tensile strength.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Studies  
 
Pharmacokinetics and MTD : The pharmacokinetics (PK) of bevaci zumab have been 
characterized in several phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials, with doses ranging from 1 to 
20 mg/kg administered weekly, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks.  The estimated half -life 
of bevacizumab is approximately 21 days (range 11 -50 days).  The predicted time to 
reach steady state was 100 days.  The volume of distribution is consistent with limited 
extravascular distribution.    
 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bevacizumab has not been determined; however, 
the dose level of 20 mg/kg was a ssociated with severe headaches (Cobleigh et al. , 2003).  
The dose schedule of either 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or 15 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_33350] phase 2 or 3 trials with only a few exceptions ( e.g., the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 trial in 
colorectal cancer, in  which bevacizumab was given at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks).  
 
Clinical efficacy of bevacizumab : Clinical proof of principle for anti -VEGF therapy with 
bevacizumab has been observed in several solid tumors.  In first - and second -line 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), the combination of bevacizumab with 5 -FU-based 
chemotherapy improved the overall  survival (OS), progression -free survival (PFS), and 
response rate (RR) as compared to chemotherapy alone (Hurwitz et al.  2004; Giantonio et 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
15 
 al., 2007).  There was also improved overall survival in first -line non -small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) patients ( E4599 ) treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel + bevacizumab 
compared with chemotherapy alone.  Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy 
has been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for treatment in mCRC 
(first and second lines) and in NSCLC . 
 
In untreated advanced and metastatic breast cancer, addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel 
also significantly improved the RR and PFS ( E2100 ; Miller et al. , 2005).  However, in the 
phase [ADDRESS_33351]  cancer, the 
addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine did not show an improvement in PFS despi[INVESTIGATOR_33929] (Miller et al. , 2002) . In locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic 
cancer, a Phase 3 also failed to demonstrate an overall survival (OS) or PFS advantage by 
[CONTACT_33972] ( CALGB -[ZIP_CODE] ) (Kindler et al. , 2007) . 
Bevacizumab has been studied as m onotherapy in renal cell cancer (RCC).  In a three -
arm, double -blind, placebo -controlled phase 2 trial (Yang  et al. , 2003) , patients with 
previously treated stage IV RCC were randomized to high -dose (HD) bevacizumab (10 
mg/kg every 2 weeks), low -dose (LD) bevacizumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks), or placebo.  
The s tudy demonstrated a highly significant prolongation of time to progression (TTP) in 
the HD arm (4.8 months) as compared with the placebo (2.6 months) (hazard ratio 
[HR]=2.55,  P=0.0002); the LD arm was associated with a smaller difference in TTP (3.0 
months ) of borderline significance.  The tumor response rate was 10% in the HD arm but 
0% in the LD and placebo groups.   
 
A Phase 3 study ( BO17705 ) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) plus interferon -
α2a versus interferon -α2a plus placebo as first -line th erapy in patients with advanced 
and/or  metastatic RCC demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant 
improvements in PFS (10.2 vs. 5.4 months), and objective response rate (ORR) (31.4 vs. 
12.8%).  
 
The Phase [ADDRESS_33352] atistically significant improvement in OS 
when bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was added to the gemcitabine/erlotinib 
combination in the first -line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.  The Phase 3 NCI -
sponsored CALGB -[ZIP_CODE]  study investigating the use of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 
weeks) combined with gemcitabine was prematurely terminated after the CALGB Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) concluded that the futility boundary defined for the 
primary efficacy parameter (OS) had been crossed in a protocol -specified interim analysis 
(dated June 16th, 2006).  
 
Additional clinical trials are ongoing in a variety of solid tumors and hematological 
malignancies using bevacizumab as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, 
radiation, or other targ eted/biological agents.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Profile  
 
Based on clinical trials with bevacizumab as monotherapy or in combination with 
chemotherapy, the most common adverse events (AEs) of any severity included asthenia, 
pain, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, stomatitis, constipation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], dyspnea, 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33353] common grade 3 -4 AEs were asthenia, pain, 
hypertension, diarrhea, and leukopenia.  
 
The major bevacizumab -associated AEs identified in phase 1 to phase 3 trials include 
hypertension, proteinuria, arterial thromboembolic ev ents (ATEs), hemorrhage, 
congestive heart failure (CHF), gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, and wound healing 
complications.  Other serious AEs (SAEs) observed with bevacizumab therapy include 
reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) and f istula formation.  
The following details a description of major AEs associated with bevacizumab therapy.  
In addition, a list of Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks (CAEPR)  in 
NCI-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) terms is included in 
Section 7.1 of the protocol.  Reference may also be made to the Investigators’ Brochure 
and the FDA package insert ( www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2004/125085lbl.pdf ).  
 
Infusion -Related Reaction s:  Infusion reactions with bevacizumab were uncommon 
(<3%) and rarely severe (0.2%).  Infusion reactions may include rash, urticaria, fever, 
rigors, hypertension, hypotension, wheezing, or hypoxia.  Currently, there is no adequate 
information on the safet y of retreatment with bevacizumab in patients who have 
experienced severe infusion -related reactions.  
 
Hypertension :  Hypertension is common in patients treated with bevacizumab, with an 
incidence of 20 -30% (all grades) across trials, with a mean increase  of +5.5mmHg to 
+8.4mmHg for systolic pressure, or +4.1mmHg to +5.4mmHg for diastolic pressure.  
Incidence of grade 3 (hypertension requiring initiation of or increase in hypertensive 
medications) ranges from 7.8 to 17.9%.  Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensi ve crisis) 
occurred in up to 0.5% of bevacizumab -treated patients.  
 
Hypertension associated with bevacizumab can generally be controlled with routine oral 
drugs while bevacizumab is continued.  However, incidents of hypertensive crisis with 
encephalopathy (including RPLS) or cardiovascular sequelae have been rarely reported.  
Blood pressure (BP) should be closely monitored during bevacizumab therapy and the 
goal of BP control should be consistent with standard medical practice (Chobanian et al, 
2003).  Beva cizumab therapy should be suspended in the event of uncontrolled 
hypertension . 
 
Proteinuria :  Proteinuria has been seen in all bevacizumab studies to date, ranging in 
severity from mild asymptomatic increase in urine protein (incidence of about 38%) to 
rare instances of grade 3 proteinuria (>3.5gm/24 hour urine) (3%) or nephrotic syndrome 
(1.4%).  Pathologic findings on renal biopsies in two patients showed proliferative 
glomerulonephritis.  The risk of proteinuria may be higher in patients with advanced RC C 
or history of hypertension.  There is also evidence from dose -finding trials that the rate of 
proteinuria may be dose related.   
 
Renal thrombotic microangiopathy :  Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been 
described in biopsy samples from case reports of patients treated with bevacizumab and 
other anti -VEGF agents.  The presentation was mostly localized to the kidney, and 
systemic manifestations (e.g., thrombocytopen ia or schistocytosis) were present only in 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
17 
 some of these patients.  As renal biopsies were rarely performed in patients with 
proteinuria or renal insufficiency, the true rate of renal -localized or subclinical TMA is 
not assessable. Available data indicate that systemically evident TMA (i.e., with evidence 
of hemolysis or thrombocytopenia) is very rare. However, the use of more than one anti -
VEGF agent in combination might enhance the risk.  In a phase 1 dose escalation trial of 
concurrent bevacizumab (10 mg /kg every 2 weeks) and escalating doses of sunitinib (25 
mg, 37.5 mg or 50 mg daily for 4 out of 6 weeks) in patients with RCC, [ADDRESS_33354] dose level developed systemic TMA, or microangiopathic 
hemolytic anemia; clinical presentati ons in these cases included thrombocytopenia, 
schistocytes, hypertension, and varying degrees of proteinuria.  
 
Hemorrhage :  Overall, grade 3 and 4 events associated with bleeding or hemorrhage were 
observed in 4.0% of 1,[ADDRESS_33355] been observed in bevacizumab clinical studies were predominantly tumor -
associated hemorrhage and minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage.  
 
Tumor -associated hemorrhage  - Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage/hemoptysis 
has been observed primarily in patients with NSCLC.  In a phase 2 study in NSCLC, 6 
cases of life -threatening (4 fatal) hemoptysis were reported among 66 patients treated 
with bevacizumab and chemotherapy (Novotny et al., 2001); squamous cell histology was 
identified as the risk factor.  In the phase 3 trial in non -squamous NSCLC ( E4599 ), the 
rate of Grade ≥3 broncho -pulmonary hemorrhage was <1% in the control arm 
(carboplatin/p aclitaxel) versus 2.3% in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab arm (10/427 
patients, including 7 deaths) . 
 
GI hemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melena have been reported in patients with 
CRC, and have been assessed as tumor -associated hemorrhages.  I n the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 
trial in advanced CRC, the rate of GI (duodenal, ileal, cecal and colonic ) hemorrhage (all 
grades) was 24% in the irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (IFL)/bevacizumab arm 
compared to 6% in the IFL alone arm; grade 3 -4 hemorrhage was 3.1% for 
IFL/bevacizumab and 2.5% for IFL.   
 
Serious tumor associated bleedings have also  been observed in patients with pancreatic 
cancer, gastric cancer, central nervous system (CNS) metastases, hepatoma, or varices 
treated with bevacizumab.  
 
Mucocutaneous hemorrhage  - Across all bevacizumab clinical trials, mucocutaneous 
hemorrhage has bee n seen in 20% -40% of patients treated.  These were most commonly 
NCI-CTC Grade [ADDRESS_33356] also been less c ommon events of minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage in other 
locations, such as gingival bleeding and vaginal bleeding.  
 
Thromboembolic Events, Arterial (ATE) :  The risk of ATEs is increased with 
bevacizumab therapy; such events included cerebral infarction, tr ansient ischemic attack 
(TIA), myocardial infarction (MI), and other peripheral or visceral arterial thrombosis.  A 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
18 
 pooled analysis of five randomized studies showed a two -fold increase in these events 
(3.8% vs. 1.7%).  ATE led to a fatal outcome in 0.8% p atients with bevacizumab (vs. 
0.5% without bevacizumab).  The rate of cerebrovascular accidents (including TIA) was 
2.3% vs. 0.5%, and the rates of MI 1.7% vs. 0.7%.  Certain baseline characteristics, such 
as age and prior arterial ischemic events, appear to confer additional risk (Skillings et al. , 
2005).  In patients >65 years treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy, the rate of 
ATE was approximately 8.5%.  
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a standard therapy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of ATE in patients at 
high r isk of such events, and the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ≤[ADDRESS_33357] the risk of ATE were 
inconclusive.  Further analyses of the effects of concomitant use of bevacizumab and 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33931].  
 
Thromboembolic Events, Venous (VTE) (including deep venous t hrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, and thrombophlebitis) :  In the phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_33932], there was a 
slightly higher rate of VTE in patients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab 
compared with chemotherapy alone (19% vs. 16%).  The incidence of NC I-CTC Grade 3 
VTEs in one NSCLC trial ( E4599 ) was higher in the bevacizumab -containing arm 
compared to the chemotherapy control arm (5.6% vs. 3.2%).  
 
In clinical trials across all indications, the overall incidence of VTEs ranged from 2.8% to 
17.3% in the bevacizumab -containing arms compared to 3.2% to 15.6% in the 
chemotherapy control arms. The use of bevacizumab with chemotherapy does not 
substantially increase the risk of VTE compared with chemotherapy alone. However, 
patients with mCRC who receive b evacizumab and experienced VTE may be at higher 
risk for recurrence of VTE.  
 
Perforations of GI tract :  GI perforations/fistula are rare but have occurred at an increased 
rate in bevacizumab -containing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The majority of such events required surgi cal 
intervention, and some were associated with a fatal outcome.  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 trial 
in CRC ( AVF2107 ), the incidence of bowel perforation was 2% in patients receiving 
IFL/bevacizumab and 4% in patients receiving fluorouracil (5 -FU)/bevacizumab 
compared to 0.3% in patients receiving IFL alone.  GI perforation has also been reported 
in non -CRC tumors ( e.g., gastric/esophageal, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers) or 
nonmalignant conditions such as diverticulitis and gastric ulcer.  GI perforation should  be 
included in the differential diagnosis of patients on bevacizumab therapy presenting with 
abdominal pain or rectal/abdominal abscess.  
 
GI Fistula :  Fistula formations, including events resulting in death, have been observed in 
patients receiving bevaci zumab in clinical studies and post -marketing reports.  Fistulae in 
the GI tract are common (1 -10% incidence) in patients with certain metastatic tumors 
such as CRC or cervical, but uncommon (0.1 -1%) or rare (0.01 -0.1%) in other 
indications.  
 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
19 
 In GOG 240, t he rate of GI vaginal fistula was 8.2%.  
 
In addition, fistulae that involve areas other than the GI tract have also been observed 
(e.g. tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, urogenital, and biliary).  Events were reported at 
various time points during treatment, ranging from 1 week to [ADDRESS_33358] 6 months of therapy.  
Tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula:  Life -threatening or fatal TE fistula has been reported in 
patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with concurrent c hemoradiation and 
bevacizumab.  In a phase 2 trial of bevacizumab plus irinotecan, carboplatin, and 
radiation therapy (RT) followed by [CONTACT_33973] [ADDRESS_33359] been two confirmed cases of TE fistula (one fatal) and a thi rd case of fatal 
upper aerodigestive tract hemorrhage, with TE fistula suspected but not confirmed.  All 
three events occurred during the bevacizumab maintenance phase (1.5 to 4 months after 
completion of chemoradiation).  While pulmonary fistula (includin g TE fistula) has also 
been observed in advanced NSCLC or SCLC patients receiving bevacizumab and 
chemotherapy (without RT), the incidence was extremely low.   
 
Wound Healing Complications :  Bevacizumab delays wound healing in rabbits, and it 
may also comp romise or delay wound healing in patients.  Bowel anastomotic dehiscence 
and skin wound dehiscence have been reported in clinical trials with bevacizumab.   
The appropriate interval between surgery and initiation of bevacizumab required to avoid  
the risk o f impaired wound healing has not been determined.  Across mCRC trials, at least 
[ADDRESS_33360] elapsed following major surgery before bevacizumab could be 
initiated; data suggested initiation of bevacizumab [ADDRESS_33361] -operative bleeding or wound healing complications in the IFL plus 
bevacizumab arms vs. IFL alone [10% (4/40) vs. 0% (0/25)] (Scappaticci et al.,  2005) .  
Decisions on the timing of elective surgery should take into consideration the half -life of 
bevacizumab (average 21 days, range 11 -50 days).  
 
If patients receiving treatment with bevacizumab require elective major surgery, it is 
recommended that bevaciz umab be held for 4 –8 weeks prior to the surgical procedure.  
Patients undergoing a major surgical procedure should not begin/restart bevacizumab 
until 4 weeks after that procedure (in the case of high -risk procedures such as liver 
resection, thoracotomy, o r neurosurgery, it is recommended that chemotherapy be 
restarted no earlier than 6 weeks and bevacizumab no earlier than 8 weeks after surgery).  
 
Heart failure (HF) :  The risk of left ventricular dysfunction may be increased in patients 
with prior or concu rrent anthracycline treatment.  In phase [ADDRESS_33362] 
cancer ( AVF 2119g ) in which all patients had received prior anthracyclines, congestive 
heart failure (CHF) or cardiomyopathy were reported in 3% in the bevacizumab plus 
capecitabine arm  compared to 1% in the capecitabine -only arm (Miller et al. 2005).  In a 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33363] cancer ( E2100 ), the 
incidence of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease (defined as NCI -CTC 
Grade 3 o r 4) in the paclitaxel plus bevacizumab arm was 0.3% versus 0% for the 
paclitaxel alone arm  
 
In phase 2 study of 48 patients with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia treated with 
cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and bevacizumab, five cases of cardiac dysfunction (CHF) or 
LVEF decreases to <40% were reported. All but one of these subjects had significant 
prior exposure to anthracyclines as well.  Two additional studies investigated concurrent 
administration of anthracyclines and bevacizumab.  In [ADDRESS_33364] cancer treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel, doxorubicin (cumulative doses at 240 
mg/m2), and bevacizumab, no patients developed clinically apparent CHF; however, 
patients had asymptomatic decreases in LVEF to 40% (Wedam et al. , 2006).  In a small 
phase 2 study in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, 2 of the 17 patients treated with 
bevacizumab and high -dose doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) developed CHF (one Grade 3 event 
after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 591 mg/m2 and one Grade 4 ev ent after a 
cumulative doxorubicin dose of 420  mg/m2); an additional 4 patients had asymptomatic 
decreases in LVEF (D’Adamo et al. 2004).  Patients receiving anthracyclines or with 
prior exposure to anthracyclines should have a baseline Multi Gated Acquisi tion Scan 
(MUGA) or echocardiogram  (ECHO) with a normal ejection fraction.   
 
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), Posterior Reversible 
Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), or similar leukoencephalopathy syndrome :  
RPLS/PRES are clinical sy ndromes related to vasogenic edema of the white matter and 
have rarely reported in association with bevacizumab therapy (<1%).  Clinical 
presentations may include altered mental status, seizure, visual disturbance or cortical 
blindness, with or without ass ociated hypertension.  MRI scans are required for diagnosis.  
[Typi[INVESTIGATOR_33933] (enhanced intensity in T2 and FLAIR sequences 
on non -contrast magnetic resonance imaging  [MRI]) predominantly in the white matter of 
the posterior parietal and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_33934], and less frequently, in the anterior distributions 
and the gray matter].   
 
RPLS/PRES is potentially reversible, but timely correction of the underlying causes, 
including control of BP and interruption of the offending drug, is importa nt in order to 
prevent irreversible tissue damage.  The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in 
patients previously experiencing RPLS is not known (Glusker et al.,  2006; Ozcan et al.,  
2006).   
 
Neutropenia :  In the phase 3 trial with IFL plus or minu s bevacizumab in CRC, Grade 3 -4 
neutropenia was 21% with bevacizumab plus IFL vs. 14% with IFL alone (Grade 4 
neutropenia was 3% vs. 2%).   Increased rates of severe neutropenia , febrile neutropenia, 
or infection with severe  neutropenia (including some fata lities) have been observed in 
patients treated with some myelotoxic chemotherapy regimens plus bevacizumab.  In a 
phase 3 trial in NSCLC, the carboplatin and paclitaxel plus bevacizumab arm was 
associated with increased rate of Grade 4 neutropenia (27% vs.  17%), febrile neutropenia 
(5.4% vs. 1.8%), and infection with neutropenia (4.4% vs. 2.0%) with three fatal cases 
(Sandler et al. , 2006 ).

Bone metaphyseal dysplasia in children with active (open) growth plates :  Inhibitors of 
VEGF/VEGFR pathways have been  shown to induce physeal dysplasia in juvenile 
cynomolgus monkeys with open growth plates.  Asymptomatic metaphyseal bone lesions 
were also observed in a 4.5 -month old infant after 4 doses (8 weeks) of bevacizumab for 
treatment of cutaneovisceral angiomato sis with thrombocytopenia (CAT).  The 
radiographic findings included lytic lesions in the metaphyses of upper and lower 
extremity long bones, which reversed following cessation of bevacizumab (Smith et al,  
2008).  In a phase 1 pediatric study with bevacizu mab, metaphyseal expansion was not 
observed in the three patients with open growth plates at baseline; however, the duration 
of treatment was limited (Bender  et al., 2008).   At this time, experience is limited for 
prolonged treatment with bevacizumab in children, and no data are available for the long 
term impact of bevacizumab on growth.    
 
Additional Adverse Events:   See the bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for additional 
details regarding the safety experience with bevacizumab.  
 
Fertility and Pregnancy :  Clinical data are lacking regarding the immediate or long -term 
effect of bevacizumab on fertility and pregnancy.  However, bevacizumab is known to be 
teratogenic and detri mental to fetal development in animal models.  In addition, 
bevacizumab may alter corpus luteum development and endometrial proliferation, thereby 
[CONTACT_7661] a negative effect on fertility.  As an IgG1, it may also be secreted in human milk.  
Therefore, fertil e men and women on bevacizumab studies must use adequate 
contraceptive measures and women should avoid breast feeding.  The duration of such 
precautions after discontinuation of bevacizumab should take into consideration the half -
life of the agent (average  21 days, ranging from 11 to 50 days).  
 
Immunogenicity :  As a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with 
bevacizumab.  With the currently available assay with limited sensitivity, high titer 
human anti -bevacizumab antibodies have not  been detected in approximately 500 patients 
treated with bevacizumab.  
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
Preclinical data illustrate the immunosuppressive effects of VEGF, which are reversed by [CONTACT_33974].  VEGF is thought to induce myeloid derive suppressor cells (MDSC), which suppress 
the anti -tumor T -cell and dendritic cell response 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22437938 ). VEGF blockade may increase T cell 
trafficking to tumors, increase anti -tumor populations of T cells (CD8+ and CD4+ central 
memory) and decrease pro -tumor immune populations (myeloid -derived suppressor c ells and 
regulatory T cells) ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18566400 , 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24018532 , 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17606729 , 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20631075 ).  In addition, anti -VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33935], tumor -infiltrating T regulatory cells and MDSC 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19888452 ). 
 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33365] illustrated the potential advantage of adding anti -angiogenic agents 
to che ckpoint blockade therapy. A Phase II study of bevacizumab with the anti -CTLA -4 agent 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_33936] a DCR of 67.4% and median survival of 25.1 months, which 
was substantially better than historical controls.  Furthermore, on -treatment biopsi es exhibited 
inflammation and lymphocyte infiltration (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838938).  In a  
Phase Ib study of 12 patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with bevacizumab and 
atezolizumab , 40% had an objective response, which appeared to o ccur independent of PD -L1 
IHC staining (Figure 1, McDermott et al, ESMO 2014, Abstract 809O; Sznol et al, JClin Oncol 
33, [ADDRESS_33366] 410).  A phase III trial is in progress (A phase III, open label, randomized 
study of atezolizumab  [anti-PD-L1 antibody]  in combination with bevacizumab versus sunitinib 
in patients with untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma).  Renal cell carcinomas (RCC), like 
cervix cancers, do not harbor a particularly high mutational burden, and are treated with 
bevacizumab as a stand ard of care.   
 
The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has already provided an excellent safety 
signal.  In Study GP28328, the grade 3 -5 AE rate was 1/35 patients (2.9%).  The one >= grade 3 
event was neutropenia.    
 
2.4 Correlative Studies Backgroun d 
 
2.4.1 PD-L1 Expression ( integrated  biomarker)  
 
The expression of PD -L1 has been previously demonstrated to be associated with 
improved clinical benefit from therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33937] -1/PD -L1 pathway (reviewed in 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714771).  The utility of PD -L1 expression as a 
predictive biomarker, however, has been debated as it is highly dynamic and can be up -
regulated in response to immune activating factors. In this trial, tumor and immune cell 
PD-L1 staining will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_9064] (IHC)  in formalin -fixed, 
paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue from an archived sample and a pre -treatment 
biopsy per patient . In patients in whom biopsy tissue is  insufficient , this evaluation will be 
performed only on archived tissue . If responses occur predominantly in patients with PD -
L1 positive tumors, this would suggest it should be explored in larger studies; whereas, if 
there no association between PD -L1 and response, this would suggest either the sample 
size was too small to d etect the association, or that there is not a strong association.  
 
2.4.2 TCR sequencing (exploratory biomarker)  
TCR sequencing (TCRSeq) will be performed on the tumor and peripheral blood  
mononuclear cells (PBMC)  at baseline. Genomic DNA wi ll be purified from total 
PBMCs; FFPE slides from pre -treatment tumor biopsy samples  will be used for 
intratumoral TCR sequencing . If biopsy tissue is insufficient, archived tissue may be 
used. The TCRCDR3 regions will be amplified and sequenced using Immu noSEQ  
technology  (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA) as previously described 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19706884 ). If baseline intratumoral or peripheral 
TCR clonality associates wi th response to therapy, as has been seen in other solid tumors, 
this could provide a complementary or improved biomarker relative to PD -L1. If no such

NOTE :  Prior adjuvant therapy is NOT  counted as a systemic chemotherapeutic 
regimen for management of recurrent, persistent or metastatic carcinoma of the 
cervix.  Adjuvant therapy includes cisplatin given concurrent with primary radiation 
therapy (CCRT) and adjuvant chemotherapy given following the completion of 
concurrent chemother apy and radiation therapy (e.g.,  paclitaxel and carboplatin for up 
to 4 cycles).   
 
3.1.3 Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use 
of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab in  patients <18 years of age, children 
are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.

 4.2 Site Registration  
 
This study is s upported by [CONTACT_6818] (CTSU).  
 
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this 
protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office 
before they  can be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site registration status in the 
CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination of whether 
a site has fulfilled all regulatory criteria including but not limited to: an ac tive Federal Wide 
Assurance (FWA) number, an active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating 
organization, a valid IRB approval, and compliance with all protocol specific requirements.  
 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that  are approved by [CONTACT_33978]. For sites 
using the CIRB, IRB approval information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in 
an automated process.  Sign atory Institutions must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local

5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose 
modifications are described in Section 6.  No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33940] w ith the intent to treat the patient's 
malignancy.  
 
Enrolled patients with initiate treatment with atezolizumab and bevacizumab beginning Day [ADDRESS_33380] cycle, then every 
3 weeks.  
 
Patients that require discontinuation of one study agent (atezolizumab or bevacizumab), but meet  
criteria to continue the other study agent (atezolizumab or bevacizumab) may do so after 
discussion with the  study chair . 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
33 
  
During screening, every 9 weeks (+/ - 7 days) for the first year then every 12 weeks (+/ -7 days), 
and at the end of study, patients w ill have a CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis and a CT of 
the chest performed.  
 
A patient will be permitted to have a new cycle of chemotherapy delayed up to 7 days (without 
this being considered to be a protocol violation) for major life events (e.g., s erious illness in a 
family member, major holiday, vacation which is unable to be re -scheduled).  Documentation to 
justify this decision should be provided.  
 
It will be acceptable for a new cycle of therapy (and all associated tests and procedures) to be 
delivered within a 3 day window before and after the protocol defined date.  
 
5.1.1 Atezolizumab  
 
Administration of atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical 
facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergen cies. 
 
The initial dose of atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 ( 15) minutes.  If the 
first infusion is tolerated without infusion -associated AEs, the second infusion may be 
delivered over 30 ( 10) minutes.  If the 30 -minute infusion is well tolerated, 
all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 ( 10) minutes.  Anaphylactic 
precautions should be observed during atezolizumab administration.  
Premedication is not permitted for the first dose of atezolizumab .  Premedication with 
antihistamines or antipyretics/analgesics (e.g., aceta minophen) may be administered for 
subsequent infusions  at the discretion of the treating physician.  The management of 
Infusion Related Reactions  will be according to severity as per Table  6: Management  
Guidelines for Infusion -Related Reactions . 
 
5.1.2 Bevacizumab  
 
Bevacizumab is administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion.  The dose should be based on 
the patient’s actual body weight; the dose will be recalculated if there is a weight  change 
of >10% from baseli ne. 
 
Bevacizumab doses can be “rounded” according to institutional standards without being 
considered a protocol violation ( most institutions use a rule of approximately +/ - 5% of 
the calculated dose ). 
 
The first dose of bevacizumab should be given over [ADDRESS_33381] p eriod that 
was well tolerated.  
 
Special Precautions/Safety Issues:  
Prior to each treatment, the patient should be carefully assessed with special attention to 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
34 
 BP, proteinuria, bleeding and cardiovascular events, as well as symptoms or signs of 
bowel perforation and RPLS.  Decisions for retreatment or dose modification/int erruption 
should follow the dose modification guidelines . 
 
Patients who have an ongoing study agent -related SAE upon study completion or at 
discontinuation from the study will be contact[CONTACT_33981]/her designee 
periodically until the even t is resolved or determined to be irreversible.  
 
Infusional reactions :  Routine premedication is not required for the first dose of 
bevacizumab.  If infusional reactions occur, acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, steroids, 
or other medications may be given for  symptom control and for premedication as needed.  
Anaphylactic precautions should be observed during bevacizumab administration.  
 
Hypertension:    Patients should have BP monitored prior to each infusion of bevacizumab.  
Hypertensive mediation should be in itiated or increased for optimal BP control according 
to standard public heath guidelines.  
 
Proteinuria:   Proteinuria should be monitored  per protocol.  
 
Surgery and wound complication issues and surgery:   The appropriate interval from 
discontinuation of be vacizumab to subsequent elective surgery required to reduce the risk 
of impaired wound healing has not been determined.  Decision on such an interval should 
take into consideration the half -life of bevacizumab.  It is generally recommended that 
bevacizumab  should be discontinued at least [ADDRESS_33382] 4 weeks after major surgery 
provided that the wound has adequately healed; in cases of high risk procedures such as  
liver resection, thoracotomy, or neurosurgery, it is recommended that bevacizumab be 
resumed no earlier than 8 weeks after surgery.  
 
5.1.3 Other Modality(ies) or Procedures  
 
N/A 
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.2.1 Atezolizumab General Concomitant Medication Guidelines  
 
Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medications or over the counter 
preparations used by a patient between the 7 days preceding the screening evaluation and 
the treatment discontinuation vis it. 
 
Patients who experience infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically 
with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or cimetidine or another H2 
receptor antagonist, as per standard practice (for sites outside the [LOCATION_002], 
equivalent medications may be substituted per local practice).  Serious infusion associated 
events manifested by [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, 
reduced oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_33941] #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
35 
 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33942] ( e.g., supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic agonists; 
see Section 5.1.1 ). 
 
Systemic corticosteroids and TNF  inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial 
immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab but may be administered at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  If feasible, alternatives to corticosteroids should be 
considered.  Premedication may be  administered for Cycles ≥2 at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids ( e.g., 
fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency 
is allowed.  Meg estrol adm inistered as appetite stimulant is acceptable while the patient is 
enrolled in the study.   
 
Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone -replacement therapy, prophylactic or 
therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as low -molecular -weight heparin or war farin at 
a stable dose level), or other allowed maintenance therapy (see Section  3.2) should 
continue their use.  Females of reproductive potential should use highly effective means 
of contraception.  
 
5.2.2 Atezolizumab Excluded Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33943], whether health 
authority -approved or experimental, is prohibited.  This includes but is not limited to the 
following:  
• Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational 
agents, or herbal therapy (except for maintenance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33944]  3.2 
and Section  5.2.1 ). 
 
It is strongly recommended that:  
• Traditional herbal medicines not be administered because the ingredients of many 
herbal medicines are not fully studied and their use may result in unanticipated 
drug-drug interactions that may cause, or confound assessment of, toxicity . 
• The use of a RANKL inhibitor (denosumab) be discontinued during the study; 
this agent could potentially alter the activity and the safety of atezolizumab . 
 
Initiation  or increased dose of granulocyte colony -stimulating factors ( e.g., granulocyte 
colony -stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony -stimulating factor, and/or 
pegfilgrastim) is prohibited for patients with solid malignancies.  
 
Patients are not allowed  to receive immunostimulatory agents, including , but not limited 
to, IFN-, IFN -, or IL -2, during the entire study.  These agents, in combination with 
atezolizumab , could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions.  
 
Patients should also not b e receiving immunosuppressive medications, including , but not 
limited to , cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide.  These agents 
could potentially alter the activity and the safety of atezolizumab .  Systemic 
corticosteroids and anti -TNF agents may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic 
effects of treatment with atezolizumab but may be administered at the discretion of the 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
36 
 treating physician.  If feasible, alternatives to these agents should be considered.  
 
In addition, all patient s (including those who discontinue the study early) should not 
receive other immunostimulatory agents for [ADDRESS_33383] dose of atezolizumab . 
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue  for an 
unlimited number of cycles or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression,  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_33384] 9 week (+/ - 7 days) CT 
if all of the following criteria are satisfied:  
• No decrease in performance status  
• No requirement for immediate alternative treatment or urgent palliative trea tment  
• Progression limited to an increase of 40% in the sum of diameters of target lesions 
(including up to 4 new lesions added to the sum)  
• No more than 4 new lesions included in the sum.  
 
NOTE:  If treatment is continued in the case of radiologic progressi on at the first 9 week 
(+/- 7 days) CT, a reassessment scan must be performed at 4 weeks (+/ - 7 days) to rule out 
ongoing progression.  
 
For patients who continue treatment in the case of radiologic progression at the first 9 week (+/ - 7 
days) CT:  
• At any su bsequent CT scan patients who have stable disease as compared to the 9 
week (+/ - 7 days) CT scan will be allowed to continue on study treatment.  
• Patients who continue treatment in the case of radiologic progression at the first 9 
week (+/ - 7 days) CT, and later experience a PR or CR (as compared to baseline CT) 
will be recorded as delayed responses.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_33385].  The every three month follow up for two years 
can be by [CONTACT_33982].  Follow -up will cease when study is terminated.  Patients 
removed from treatment  for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed until resolution or

Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33386] be 
documented in the Case Report Form.  
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
NOTE:  Patients that require discontinuation of one study agent (atezolizumab or bevacizumab), 
but meet criteria to continue the other study agent (atezolizumab or bevacizumab) may do so 
after discussion with the study chair.  
 
NOTE:  Upon occurrence of perforation and/or fistula (defined below) study therapy should be 
held, and the Study Chair and Research Coordinator should be notified within 48 hours.  CTEP 
will be notified within 7 d ays of study chair notification of each instance of perforation and/or 
fistula.  The study chair will consult CTEP and the study statistician to review the history of the 
affected patient and the perforation and/or fistula toxicities for the trial as a who le before 
proceeding with the recommendation to resume protocol therapy for the affected patient with 
single agent atezolizumab.  Per section 6.2.[ADDRESS_33387] be discontinued for 
perforation (GI, or any other organ), any grade AND/OR fistula ( GI, pulmonary or any other 
organ), any grade.  
 
Definition of perforation and fistula:  
• Perforation (GI, or any other organ), any grade  
• Fistula (GI, pulmonary or any other organ), any grade  
 
6.1 Atezolizumab ( MPDL3280A ) 
 
6.1.1 General AE  Management  and Dose Modificat ion Guidelines  
 
There will be no dose reduction for atezolizumab in this study.  Patients may temporarily 
suspend study treatment for up to 84 days  (12 weeks)  beyond the scheduled date of 
delayed infusion if study drug -related toxicity requiring dose suspe nsion is experienced.  
If atezolizumab is held because of AEs for 84 days beyond the scheduled date of 
infusion, the patient will be discontinued from atezolizumab and will be followed for 
safety and efficacy as specified in this protocol.  If the AE resol ves within 84 days and the 
patient is receiving corticosteroid therapy for the event, atezolizumab may be held for 
longer than 84 days (up to 4 weeks) in order to allow tapering of the steroid dose to ≤10 
mg oral prednisone or equivalent.  
 
Please note:  Tumor measurements  must continue  on schedule (see study calendar, section 
10.1) during temporary suspension  (Tumor measurements are repeated every 9 weeks (+/ - 
7 days) for 12 months, then every 12 weeks (+/ - 7 days) thereafter. ).  Patients wi th 
progression will be discontinued from study treatment.  
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33388] be permanently discontinued  if the patient experiences any of the 
following events, regardless of benefit:  
 
• Grade 4 pneumonitis  
• AST or ALT >5×ULN or total bilirubin >3×ULN  
• Grade 4 diarrhea or colitis  
• Grade 4 hypophysitis  
• Any grade myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Guillain -Barré or  
meningoencephalitis  
• Grade 4 ocular inflammatory toxicity  
• Grade 4 pancreatitis or any grade of recurrent pancreatitis  
• Grade 4 rash  
• Any grade myocarditis  
 
Treatment may, under limited and compelling circumstances, be resumed in patients who 
have recovered f rom the following events, but only after consultation with the trial 
Principal Investigator : 
• Grade 3 pneumonitis  
• Grade 3 ocular inflammatory toxicity  
• Grade [ADDRESS_33389] immune -related adverse events ( irAEs ) observed with i mmunomodulatory 
agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should be recognized early and 
treated promptly to avoid potential major complications  (Di Giacomo et al., 2010) .  
Discontinuation of atezolizumab may not have an immediate therapeutic ef fect, and there 
is no available antidote for atezolizumab .  In severe cases, immune -related toxicities may 
be acutely managed with topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], systemic corticosteroids, or other 
immunosuppressive agents. The investigator should consider the be nefit-risk balance 
prior to further administration of atezolizumab.  
For detailed information regarding management of adverse events associated with 
atezolizumab, please refer to the most current version of the Atezolizumab Investigator’s 
Brochure and the F DA product label . 
 
The primary approach to grade 1 to 2 irAEs is supportive and symptomatic care with 
continued treatment with atezolizumab ; for higher -grade irAEs, atezolizumab should be 
withheld and oral and/or parenteral steroids administered.  Recurrent grade 2 irAEs may 
also mandate withholding atezolizumab or the use of steroids.  Assessment of the 
benefit -risk balance should be made by [CONTACT_093], with consideration o f the totality 
of information as it pertains to the nature of the toxicity and the degree of clinical benefit 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
39 
 a given patient may be experiencing prior to further administration of atezolizumab .  
Atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients with life -threatening irAEs.  
 
Patients should be assessed clinically (including review of laboratory values) for toxicity 
prior to, during, and after each infusion.  If unmanageable toxicity due to atezolizumab 
occurs at any time during the study, treatment with atezolizumab should be discontinued.  
 
Systemic Immune Activation  
 
Systemic immune activation is a rare condition characterized by [CONTACT_33471]. Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, systemic immune activation is 
considered a potential risk  when given in combination with other immunomodulating 
agents.  Systemic immune activation should be included in the differential diagnosis for 
patients who, in the absence of an alternative etiology, develop a sepsis -like syndrome 
after administration of atezolizumab, a nd the initial evaluation should include the 
following:  
• CBC with peripheral smear  
• PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D -dimer  
• Ferritin  
• Triglycerides  
• AST, ALT, and total bilirubin  
• LDH  
• Complete neurologic and abdominal examination (assess for hepatosplenomegaly)  
 
If systemic immune activation is still suspected after the initial evaluation, contact [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_33945].  
 
 
6.1.2 Management of Specific AEs  
 
Management of certain AEs of concern, including immune -related pneumonitis, hepatitis , colitis, 
endocrinopathies, pancreatitis, neuropathies, meningoencephalitis, and potential ocular toxicities 
are presented in the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure.  See Table 6  for guidelines for the 
management of Infusion Related Reactions and Anaphyl axis. 
 
For recommendations to hold atezolizumab and begin corticosteroid treatment, use the following 
guidance for tapering the corticosteroid and resuming atezolizumab therapy after resolution of the 
event:  
 
• Corticosteroids must be tapered over 1 month to 10 mg/day oral prednisone or 
equivalent before atezolizumab can be resumed.  
• Atezolizumab may be held for a period of time beyond 12 weeks to allow for 
corticosteroids to be reduced to 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent.

 Event  Management  
Acute abdominal 
pain • Symptoms of abdominal pain associated with elevations of 
amylase and lipase, suggestive of pancreatitis, have been 
associated with administration of other immunomodulatory 
agents.  The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain 
should in clude pancreatitis.  Appropriate workup should 
include an evaluation for obstruction, as well as serum 
amylase and lipase tests.  See the guidelines for “Amylase 
and/or lipase increase” and “Immune -related pancreatitis” 
elsewhere in this table, as needed.  
• Right upper -quadrant abdominal pain and/or unexplained 
nausea or vomiting should be evaluated for potential 
hepatotoxicity (see the “Hepatotoxicity” guideline elsewhere 
in this table).  
Diarrhea or 
colitis, Any 
grade  • Patients should be advised to inform the investigator if any 
diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  
• All events of diarrhea or colitis should be thoroughly 
evaluated for other more common etiologies.  For events of 
significant duration or magnitude or associated with signs of 
systemic inf lammation or acute -phase reactants 
(e.g., increased CRP, platelet count, or bandemia):  Perform 
sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy, if appropriate) with colonic 
biopsy, with three to five specimens for standard paraffin 
block to check for inflammation and lymph ocytic infiltrates to 
confirm colitis diagnosis.

4. Endocrine Events  
Thyroid disorders or adrenal insufficiency has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab .  Management guidelines for endocrine events are provided in Table  4. 
Patients with unexplained symptoms s uch as fatigue, myalgias, impotence, mental status 
changes, or constipation should be investigated for the presence of thyroid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], or adrenal 
endocrinopathies .  The patient should be referred to a n endocrinologist if a n endocrinopathy is 
suspected.   Thyroid -stimulating hormone ( TSH) and free T3 and T4 levels should be measured  
to determine whether thyroid abnormalities are present.  TSH, prolactin, and a morning cortisol 
level will help to differentiate primary adrenal insufficiency from primary pit uitary insufficiency.

10. Immune -related meningoencephalitis  
Immune -related  meningoencephalitis is an identified  risk associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Immune -related  meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient 
presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis , including, but not 
limited to,  headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor  or sensory dysfunction , and altered or 
depressed level of consciousness.  Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances 
need s to be distinguished from potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, 
viral, or fungal) or  progre ssion of malignancy , or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.   
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with a CT 
scan and /or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation , or edema.  If 
deemed s afe by [CONTACT_1963], a lumbar puncture should be performed and a 
neurologist should be consulted .

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2  and 
7.3) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System (CTEP -AERS ) in addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_33396] (s) (CAEPRs)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
report ed and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
60 
 protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting  Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf   for 
further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 1369 patients. Below  is the CAEPR for 
Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses 
next to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple 
investigational agents and has an AE l isted on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades 
to determine if expedited reporting is required.

2Atezolizumab, being a member of a class of agents involved in the inhibition of “immune checkpoints,” 
may result in severe and possibly fatal immune -mediated adverse events probably due to T -cell activation 
and proliferation.  Immune -media ted adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving 
atezolizumab.  Adverse events potentially related to atezolizumab may be manifestations of immune -
mediated adverse events.  In clinical trials, most immune -mediated adverse reactions were rever sible and 
managed with interruptions of atezolizumab, administration of corticosteroids and supportive care.  
 
3Infusion reactions, including high -grade hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, and cytokine release 
syndrome, which have been observed followi ng administration of atezolizumab, may manifest as fever, 
chills, shakes, itching, rash, hypertension or hypotension, or difficulty breathing during and immediately 
after administration of atezolizumab.  
 
 
Adverse events reported on atezolizumab (MPDL328 0A) trials, but for which there is insufficient 
evidence to suggest that there was a reasonable possibility that atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) 
caused the adverse event :

 - Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in 
section 7.3.4.  
 
• Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_33398] use CTEP -AERS  (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site  (https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers ).  The reportin g procedures to be followed are presented in the 
“NCI G uidelines  for Investigators:  Adverse  Event Reporting  Requirements  for DCTD 
(CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs ” which can be downloaded from the CTEP 
Web site  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm )
.  These requirements are briefly outlined in the table s below (Section 7.3.3).  
 
In the rare occurrence when  Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be 
made to CT EP by [CONTACT_1381] [ADDRESS_33399] be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by [CONTACT_33996] a t the site.  
 
7.3.2 Distribution of Adverse Event Reports  
 
CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_33952] (s) (if 
applicable) of the Corresponding  Organization  or Lead Organization , the local treating 
physician, and the Reporter and Submitter .  CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for 
other e -mail recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 
7.3.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Use the NCI protocol nu mber and the protocol -specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Note:  A death on study requires both  routine and expedited reporting , regardless of 
causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “ Disease progression ” 
in the system organ class (SOC)  “General disorders and administration site conditions .”   
Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological 
changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a 
disease process) should be submitted.  
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
70 
 Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.” Any pregnancy loss should be 
reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy loss”  under the Pregnancy, puerperium 
and perinatal conditions SOC. A pregnancy loss should NOT be reported as a Grade 5 
event under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC, as currently CTEP -
AERS recognizes this event as a  patient death.

7.5 Secondary Malignancy  
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignan cy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a meta stasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent u nder an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported  expeditiously  via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
72 
 • Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related second ary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
Loading of the pathology report is required.  
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE 
reporting unless otherwise specified .

Classification: monoclonal antibody  
 
M.W.: 150 KD 
 
Mode of Action:  anti-PD-L1 
 
Description:  
Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy chains 
(448 amino acids) and two light chains (214 amino acids). Atezolizumab targets human 
PD-L1 and inhibits its interaction with it s receptor PD -1. Atezolizumab also blocks the 
binding of PD -L1 to B7.1, an interaction that is reported to provide additional inhibitory 
signals to T cells (Butte et al. 2007).  
 
How Supplied:  
Atezolizumab is provided by [CONTACT_8229]/F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] LTD and distributed by 
[CONTACT_25523], CTEP, NCI.  The agent is supplied in a single -
use, 20 -mL glass vial as a colorless -to-slightly -yellow, sterile, preservative -free clear 
liquid solution intended for IV administration. Atezolizumab is  formulated as 60 mg/mL 
atezolizumab in 20 mM histidine acetate, 120 mM sucrose, 0.04% polysorbate 20, at a pH 
of 5.8.  The vial is designed to deliver 20 mL (1200 mg) of atezolizumab solution but may 
contain more than the stated volume to enable delivery o f the entire 20 mL volume.

Method of Administration:  
Atezolizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion over [ADDRESS_33405] 
infusion is tolerated, all subsequent i nfusions may be delivered over 30 minutes. Do not 
administer atezolizumab as an intravenous push or bolus.  No premedication is indicated 
for administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab. Patients who experience an infusion 
related reaction with Cycle 1 of ate zolizumab may receive premedication with 
antihistamines or antipyretics/analgesics (e.g. acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions:  
Cytochrome P450 enzymes as well as conjugation/glucuronidation reactions are not 
involved in th e metabolism of atezolizumab. No drug interaction studies for atezolizumab 
have been conducted or are planned. There are no known interactions with other 
medicinal products or other form of interactions.  
 
Patient Care Implications:

 8.1.3 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  NCI-supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their 
authorized designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management 
Branch (PMB) polic y requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where 
the patient is to be treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between 
institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained).  The CTEP -assigned 
protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational agents.  
The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be registered with 
CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of 
Investigator), Biosketch/ Curriculum Vitae,  Supplemental Investigator Data Form 
(IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there are several participating 
investigators at one institution, CTEP -supplied investigational agents for the study 
should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_34012].  
 
In general, sites may order initial agent supplies when a subject is being screened for 
enrollment onto the study.  
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shippi[INVESTIGATOR_33953] (OAOP) application.  Access to OAOP re quires the establishment of 
a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account and the maintenance of an

9.1 Exploratory /Ancillary Correlative Studies  
 
9.1.1 PD-L1Immunohistochemistry  and T -cell Receptor Sequencing  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Collection of Specimen(s)  
 
Formalin -fixed, paraffin embedded ( FFPE ) tissue should be the most representative of the 
biospecimen type (primary, metastatic, rec urrent, persistent). Primary (FP01) and metastatic 
(FM01) tumor should be collected prior to all treatment. Recurrent and persistent tumor should 
be collected prior to the study treatment. Recurrent or persistent tumor collected from the site of 
primary disease sh ould b e labeled recurrent primary (FRP01) or persistent primary (FPP 01), 
respectively. Recurrent or persistent tumor collected from a site other than the site of primary 
disease (e.g., lymph node) should be labeled r ecurrent metastatic (FRM 01) or persisten t 
metastatic (FPM 01), respectively. Only one block may be submitted per tissue type.  
 
Biopsy tissue sampling instructions and requirements:  A minimum of one core biopsy sample 
should be attained, for the purposes of Hematoxylin  and eosin (H and E) staining, PD -L1 IHC 
and TCR sequencing. B one metastases, final needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], cytology specimens and alcohol -
fixed specimens are not suitable for  PD-L1 IHC or TCR sequencing . 
For both archived  and fresh  biopsy  tissue, e very attempt should be made to provide a block; 
however, if a block cannot be provided then unstained slides ( 9 charged, 4 µm ) should be 
submitted. For PD -L1 staining,  [ADDRESS_33407] be cut fresh and only shipped 
when requested by [CONTACT_3476] . Blocks or fresh cut (not older than 60 days) sections of FFPE 
tumor will be shipped to a designated CLIA laboratory upon  closure of each trial phase.   For the 
H&E, one of the [ADDRESS_33408] dose of therapy; g enomic DNA will be  
purified fr om total PBMCs.   PBMC DNA will be isolated from whole blood for TCR sequencing 
according to the following steps: 7 -10mL of blood should be drawn into a lavender/purple top 
tube(s) labeled with the patient’s study ID. A minimum of 3mL is needed for processi ng. 
Immediately after collection, gently invert the tube 5 -10 times to mix the blood and EDTA.  Ship 
whole blood to the address below on the day the biospecimen is collected. If the whole blood 
absolutely cannot be shipped the day it is collected, the tube (s) should be refrigerated (4°C) and 
shipped within [ADDRESS_33409]. Friedman  and colleagues will isolate whole blood DNA from these samples. DNA will then 
be shipped to Adaptive Biotechnologies for sequencing.  
The slides  of tumor tissue  for TCR sequencing will be sent to Adaptive Biotechnologies for DNA 
isolation, sequencing and d ata generation. The TCRCDR3 regions will be amplified and

 sequenced using ImmunoSEQ  technology  (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA) as previously 
described (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19706884). In brief, bias -controlled V and J 
gene primers are used to amplify rearranged V(D)J segments for high -throughput sequencing. 
After correcting s equencing errors via a clustering algorithm, CDR3 segments a re annotated  to 
identify the V, D, and J genes that contributed to each rearrangemen t. The estimated TIL content 
will be  calculated as previously described (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/254 [ZIP_CODE]). 
For each sample, Shannon entropy will be calculated on the clonal abundance of all productive 
TCR sequences in the data set.  
The type of biospecimen (block, slides) should be specified . If submitting slides, the slide type, 
thickness, and count sh ould also be specified.  
 
Labeling formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tissue  
A waterproof permanent marker or printed label should be used to label each translational science 
biospecimen with:  
NCI Protocol number [ZIP_CODE]  
Biospecimen code (see above)  
Collectio n date (mm/dd/yyyy)  
Surgical pathology accession number  
Block number  
 
Note: if labeling slides, only label on the to p, front portion of the slide. D o not place a label on 
the back of  the slide or over the tissue. T he label must fit on the slide and should not be wrapped 
around the slide or hang over the edge.

Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33416] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 9 weeks  (+/- 7 
days) .  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmator y scans should also be obtained, not less than 4  
weeks following i nitial documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) (Eisenhauer et al., 2009) .  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
Treatment may be continued in cases of radiologic progression at  the first 9 week (+/ - 7 
days) CT if all of the following criteria are satisfied (see Section 5.3.1 and Appendix B):  
• No decrease in performance status  
• No requirement for immediate alternative treatment or urgent palliative treatment  
• Progression limited to an increase of 40% in the sum of diameters of target lesions (including 
up to 4 new lesions added to the sum)  
• No more than 4 new lesions included in the sum.  
 
NOTE:  If treatment is continued in the case of radiologic progression at the first 9 week 
(+/- 7 days) CT, a reassessment scan must be performed at 4 weeks (+/ - 7 days) to rule out 
ongoing progression.  
 
For patients who continue treatment in the case of radiologic progression at the first 9 week 
(+/- 7 days) CT:  
• At any subsequent CT scan p atients who have stable disease as compared to the 9 week (+/ - 7 
days) CT scan will be allowed to continue on study treatment.  
• Patients who continue treatment in the case of radiologic progression at the first 9 week (+/ - 7 
days) CT, and later experience a PR or CR (as compared to baseline CT) will be recorded as 
delayed responses.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_33417] treatment with atezol izumab and/or bevacizumab.  
 
Evaluable for objective response.   All patients will be evaluable for response from the 
time of their first treatment with atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab.  P atients will have 
their response classified according to the definitio ns stated below.  (Note:  Patients who 
exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do no t meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33418] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm (≥2 c m) 
by [CONTACT_13190] x -ray or as ≥10 mm  (≥1 c m) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by [CONTACT_461].  
All tumor measure ments must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not 
be considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, th e 
conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol . 
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥15 mm  (≥1.5 c m) in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT s can 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm  [0.5 cm] ).  At baseline and in 
follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diam eter <10 mm  [<1 cm]  or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm  [≥1 
to <1 .5 cm] short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_13191]), are considered  as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’  thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesio ns. 
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selec ted on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest les ion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target l esions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/2018  
82 
 the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference 
to further characterize any objective  tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be r ecorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
The same method of as sessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be i maged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm  (≥1 cm)  diameter 
as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measu rable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm  (0.5 c m) or less.  If CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm  (0.5 cm) , the minimum size for a measurable 
lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations 
(e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex iss ue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variab le globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the sam e as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the  same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33419] in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such tec hniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Cytology, Histology  These techniques can b e used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplast ic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment ) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease ).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT  scans are needed t o determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressin g on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in  this circumstance should be prospectively described 
NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33420] be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive 
CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm (<1 cm) . 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diam eters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if tha t is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm  (0.5 cm) .  (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (S D):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesion s and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm  
[<1 cm]  short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete cl inical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion i ncrease.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression

 status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal  
Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements record ed since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this 
category when no lesions can be measured is not advised  
 
11.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recur rent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements  
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Primary Objectives  
To assess the anti -tumor activity (proportion of patients with objective response by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 
criteria) of atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent, persistent or metastatic 
cervical cancer.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
To estimate the duration of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)  
 
To assess safety by [CONTACT_3989] v. 5.0 
 
Integrated Biomarker  
Integrated Biomarker:  To describe the efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab and 
bevacizumab as measured by [CONTACT_33966], by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 expression on tumor and immune 
cells measured by [CONTACT_31576] -quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC)  
 
Exploratory Biomarker  
To desc ribe the efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab as measured by 
[CONTACT_33966], by [CONTACT_34005]  
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
Primary objective : 
Objective respon se rate (ORR, either partial or complete response) defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 
criteria.  
 
Null hypothesis : The administration of atezolizumab with bevacizumab to patients with 
persistent, metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer does not yield an overall respons e (ORR) 
greater than 15 percent.  
 
Alternative hypothesis:  The administration of atezolizumab with bevacizumab to patients with 
persistent, metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer yields an overall response (ORR) of 40% or 
greater.  
 
Statistical Considerations : 
A Simon 2 -stage Phase II design will be used to addre ss the primary endpoint of ORR.  The 
unacceptable response rate is 0.15; desirable response rate is 0.40.  With an error rate of (Type I 
error of 0.1, Type II error of 0.1), 22 patients are needed.  With 22 patients, there is a 90% power 
to show a differen ce in response rate from 15 to 40%.  The trial will continue to stage two only if 
two or more out of [ADDRESS_33427] exhibit a response for the study to be positive.  The ORR (either part ial or complete 
response) defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 will be calculated assuming binomial proportions and a 90% 
confidence interval will be provided.

stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early 
death from toxicity, 7) earl y death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  [Note:  By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the 
“unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibilit y criteria (with the exception of those who 
received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response 
rate.  Patients in response categories [ADDRESS_33433] a treatment failure 
(disease progression).  Thus, an i ncorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does 
not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  
 
All conclusions will be based on all eligible patients.  Subanalyses may then be performed 
on the basis of a subset of patients, exclud ing those for whom major protocol deviations 
have been identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of 
treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, these subanalyses will not serve as 
the basis for drawing conclusions  concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for 
excluding patients from the analysis will be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence 
intervals will be provided.

NCI Protocol #: [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version Date: 02/06/[ADDRESS_33440] scan (performed at 9 weeks +/ - 7 days) to allow  for temporary inflamm ation 
of the tumors that could  result  from  activation of  an immune response  system. Below  are 
examples of hypothetical  cases which  can be used as a guide for  evaluating  your patient.  
 
The protocol  specifies  continuation  of treatment  in cases  of radiologic  prog ression  at 
the first 9 week  (+/- 7 days) CT if all of the follo wing criteria  are satisfied:  
• No decrea se in perfor mance status  
• No require ment for immediate  alternati ve treatment  or urgent  pallia tive treatment 
• Progression  limited  to an increa se of 40% in the sum of diameters of target  lesion  (including 
up to 4 new lesions added to the sum)  
• No more than 4 new lesions  included  in the sum 
 
NOTE:  If treatment is continued in the case of radiologic progression at the first 9 week 
(+/- 7 days) CT, a reassessment scan must be performed at 4 weeks (+/ - 7 days) to rule out 
ongoing progression.  
 
For patients  who continue  treatment  in the case of radiologic  progression  at the first 9 
week (+/- 7 days)  CT: 
• At any subsequent  CT scan patients  who have  stable disease  as compared to the 9 week 
(+/- 7 days) CT scan will be allowed  to continue  on study  treatment.  
• Patients  who continue  treatment  in the case of radiologic  progression  at the first 9 week 
(+/- 7 days) CT, and later experience  a PR or CR (as compared to baseline  CT) will be 
recorded  as delayed responses.

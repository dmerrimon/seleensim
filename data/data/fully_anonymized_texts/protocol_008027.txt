Study Design :  This is a phase 3b, multicenter, double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled 
study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in HIV-positive subject s with 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_83281]/or  mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. 
Sample Size :  Approximately [ADDRESS_90762] Eligibility Criteria :   The study will enroll adult subjects (≥  18 years of age) 
with known HIV infection,  who have received stable HIV therapy for ≥  [ADDRESS_90763] be on stable doses of lipid-lowering therapy for ≥ 4 weeks and 
not expected to change during the duration of the study . Subjects should be on maximally 
tolerated dose of statins. For some subjects, “maximally  tolerated” may indicate no statin 
at all due to statin intolerance or contraindication to statin therapy. A statin -intole rant 
subject must meet the criteria described in Section  4.1.1 , criterion 106 . Subjects w ithout 
known clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) must have  fasting LDL -C 
of ≥ 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) or non- HDL-C of ≥ 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) as determined by 
[CONTACT_21910]. Subjects with known clinical ASCVD must have fasting 
LDL- C of ≥  70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or non- HDL-C of ≥  100 mg/dL (2.6  mmol/L) as 
determined by [CONTACT_2237]. Clinical ASCVD is defined as a history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin. Subjects must also have fasting triglycerides ≤ 600 mg/dL (6.8 mmol/L). 
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section  4.[ADDRESS_90764] :  Evolocumab or matching placebo administered by [CONTACT_83326]- doser (AMD ) or prefilled autoinjector  (AI)/Pen.  
[COMPANY_010] Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:   
The [COMPANY_010] investigational medicinal product (IMP) is evolocumab and placebo. The [COMPANY_010] 
investigational product (IP) is the IMP plus the device (AMD [called an “on -body infuser 
prefilled cartridge” in the [LOCATION_002] or AI/ pen). In this document, IMP will be referred to as 
IP.  
Double-b lind Treatment Period: 
Evolocumab 420 mg or matching placebo wil l be administered QM  at day  1 and weeks  4, 8, 12, 
16, and 20 as an SC injection. The IP ma y be delivered by [CONTACT_83327]  3 injections with AI/ pen. 
Observed, in -clinic dosing should occur at day 1 and week  20.  
Open -label Period: 
Subjects who receive a dose of IP at w eek 20 will continue in an open- label period  where all 
subjects will be treated with evolocumab 420 mg QM at weeks 24, 28, 32, 36, 40,  44, and 48. 
Dosing at week  24 is expected to be in- clinic while the remaining doses will  be at  an appropriate 
non-clinic setting (eg, at the subject’s home ). Subjects who do not wish to self-inject  in a 
non-clinic setting (eg, at the subject’s home ) may return to clinic for injection.  
Procedures:  
After subjects complete the informed consent form, s creening should be completed and the 
subject randomized or screen failed after 4 weeks (±  1 week) of signing the informed consent . 
Subjects will undergo SC placebo injection with the device anticipated to be used during study 
(AMD or AI/pen ) during screening. Subjects who tolerate the placebo injection, complete all 
screening procedures, and successfully meet all eligibility criteria at the end of screening will 
enter the double -blind treatment  period.  
Subjects will be randomized via interactive voice response system/interactive web response 
system (IVRS/IWRS) and will return to the study site for day 1 procedures while continuing their background HIV and lipid -lowering  (if applicable) treatment . Baseline evaluations will be 
performed on day [ADDRESS_90765]:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 5 of 73 
(as appli cable), and concomitant therapy will be recorded at each visit . At the end of the 
double- blind treatment period at week 24 , laborator y tests will be conducted, and vital signs, 
safety data reporting, urine pregnancy testing (as applicable) concomitant therapy, physical 
examination, and body weight/waist circumference will be recorded.  
Following the double -blind t reatment period, subjects who received a dose of IP at w eek 20 will 
continue to a 24-week  open -label period in which  all subjects will be treated with QM evolocumab 
at weeks 24,  28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48. Laboratory tests will be conducted at week 36 and 
week  52 . Vital signs, safety data reporting, urine pregnancy testing (as applicable),  and 
concomitant therapy will be recorded at  week 36. At  end of study  week 52, vital signs, safety data 
reporting, urine pregnancy testing (as applicable), concomitant therapy, physical exam ination , 
body weight , and waist circumference will be recorded . 
The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of this synopsis section. For  
a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section  7 
and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 3 ).  
Statistical Considerations :  The primary analysis will be performed when all randomized 
subjects in double- blind treatment period have either completed all the scheduled study visits in 
the double- blind treatment period or have early terminated from the study.  The superiority of 
evolocumab to placebo will be assessed for all efficacy endpoints on the full analysis set (FAS), 
which includes all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of IP  in the double- blind 
treatment period. To assess the primary endpoint of the mean percent change from baseline in 
LDL-C at week 24, a repeated measures linear effects model will be used on the FAS to compare 
the efficacy of evolocumab with placebo. The repeated measures model will include terms for 
treatment group, stratification factors, scheduled visit and the interaction of treatment with scheduled visit. Missing values will not be imputed for primary analysis.
 To evaluate the 
robustness of the analysis results, sensitivity analyses will be performed as follows :  the primary 
analysis  will be repeated using the computer analysis set ( CAS); non-parametric analyses will be 
performed; a sensitivity analysis under the assumption that subjects who discontinued IP with 
missing endpoint data have a mean zero percent change from baseline will be conducted. The 
statistical model an d testing of the tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints will be similar  to the 
primary analysis of primary endpoint . Analysis of the tier 2 secondary efficacy endpoints will use 
the same analysis model as the tier 1 endpoints . Safety endpoints will be summari zed 
descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].

2. BACKGROUND AND RAT I
ONALE  
2.1 Disease 
Approximately 35 million individuals are living with HIV worldwide, with 1.3 million in the 
[LOCATION_002] ( Kohli and Giugliano 2013). In countries with access to highly active 
antiretroviral therapy, the prognosis of HIV infection has changed with mortality from 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 15 of 73 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related causes declining while non-AIDS 
related causes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), have risen. HIV -infected 
patients have an increased risk of CVD as evidenced by [CONTACT_83328] (MI) after accounting for age and other comorbidities ( Triant et al , 2007).  
In the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Virtual Cohort, HIV-positive veterans had an almost 
50% greater risk of incident MI compared with uninfected veterans after statistical adjustment for Framingham risk, comorbidities, and substance abuse 
(Freiberg et al, 2013). A study by [CONTACT_83329] a 20% higher 
risk of ischemic stroke in HIV positive versus matched HIV negative controls, adjusted 
for demographics and stroke risk factors . This study also linked a higher viral load to 
increased stroke risk ( Chow et al , 2012). In addition, a worse outcome after MI has been 
reported among HIV-positive patients when compared to the general population 
(Carballo et al , 2015). 
By [CONTACT_2892] 2015, it is estimated that over half of HIV -infected individuals will be aged 
[ADDRESS_90784] 
higher rates of significant comorbidities including dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes, hypertension, 
and smoking compared with non-HIV infected patients (Triant et al , 2007;  
Boccara et al, 2013). HIV-infected patients also have higher levels of inflammatory 
mark ers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), 
D-Dimer, and soluble
 cell differentiation antigen s CD14 ( Kuller et al , 2008;  
Neuhaus  et al, 2010).  
The Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART ) Study showed a 
higher rate of CVD events in patients who discontinued antiretroviral treatment 
compared with patients on continuous therapy, with a hazard ratio of 1.57 
(El-Sadr et al, 2006). In groups experiencing treatment interruption, the levels of the 
inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and the coagulation marker D -dimer were significantly 
elevated. Markers of inflammation were also related with the changes in HIV-RNA levels 
in other treatment interruption studies ( Calmy et al, 2009). In addition, these [ADDRESS_90785] also been statistically associated with the development of CVD ( Kuller et al , 2008).

In addition to the increased risk of CVD attributed directly to HIV infection, HIV 
therapy  itself, particularly protease inhibitors (PI), are also linked to increased CVD 
risk. HIV therapy has been shown to promote adipocyte dysfunction which leads 
to a lipodystrophy syndrome ( Carr 2000; Grinspoon 2005; Capeau 2007; 
Boccara et al, 2010; Caron-Debarle et al , 2010). The lipodystrophy syndrome is 
manifested as increased visceral fat, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL-C . Increased 
rates of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, in addition to lipodystrophy, have also 
been reported in HIV -infected patients. (Carr et al , 1999; Periard et al , 1999; 
Grinspoon 2005). These factors demonstrate the etiology and pathophysiology of 
increased CVD risk seen in HIV -infected patients is multifactorial and includes HIV 
infection itself, therapy for HIV including PI [CONTACT_48831], inflammation, and traditional cardiac risk factors including dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  
In an observational cohort study of HIV-infected patients, statin therapy contributed to the reduction of all -cause mortality ( Rasmussen et al , 2013). Randomized, controlled 
trial data demonstrating statin reduction in cardiovascular  mortality in HIV subjects is not 
available although a trial using pi[INVESTIGATOR_83291]. In the HIV population, those 
patients treated with statins appear to be relatively resistant to statin effects as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_83330]-C ( Johns et al , 2007; 
Silverberg et al , 2009).

an anti -PCSK9 monoclonal antibody is therefore a plausible target for LDL -C reduction 
in HIV-infected individuals. 
It is anticipated that evolocumab may be used in HIV -infected individuals who cannot 
achieve optimal LDL -C despi[INVESTIGATOR_83292]. Therefore, understanding the 
safety and efficacy of evolocumab in patients with HIV is important. 
For further details on evolocumab efficacy  and safety results refer to the Evolocumab 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.4 Clinical Hypotheses 
Subcutaneous  evolocumab QM will be well tolerated and will result in greater reduction 
of LDL-C, defined as percent change from baseline at week 24, compared with placebo 
QM in HIV-positive subjects with hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_83285]. 
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a  phase 3b, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with 
an open-label  extension  period designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
evolocumab in HIV -positive subjects with hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_83281]/or  mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. 
Treatment with baselin e HIV and lipid-lowering (if applicable) medications being taken at 
randomization will continue throughout the clinical study . The study consists of 
3 periods: 
• Screening (to ensure tolerance of SC injections, includes a placebo injection)  
• Double-blind treatment period 
• Open-label  extension period 
Subjects will undergo screening procedures, including laboratory assessments and a 
screening placebo injection, before being randomized 2:1 into the following treatment 
groups  for the double-blind treatment period: 
• SC evolocumab 420 mg QM  
• SC placebo QM  
The overall sample size will be approximately 450 subjects , with approximately 
300 subjects in the evolocumab group. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_83332] (yes/no) and by [CONTACT_971] C status (yes/no). The size of the subgroup not on 
statin therapy is expected to be approximately 10% and no more than 20%  of the

Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  [ADDRESS_90788] ( IP) at week 20 will continue in an open-label  period during which 
all subjects  will be treated with QM evolocumab . The open-label period will continue  up 
through the end of study (EOS) visit at w eek 52.  
SC evolocumab and placebo will be administered QM at the study site or appropriate 
non-investigator site settings (eg, at the subject’s home) by [CONTACT_83333] -doser (AMD ; 
referred to in the [LOCATION_002] as an “on-body infuser prefilled cartridge” ) or by  
[CONTACT_83334]-based prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/pen). 
3.2 Number of Sites 
Approximately 75 sites globally will participate in this study.  Sites that do not enroll 
subjects within 3 months of site initiation may be closed.  
3.3 Number of Subjects 
Approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled, with approximately 300 subjects in the 
evolocumab group. 
3.4 Replacement  of Subjects 
Subjects who are withdrawn or removed from treatment or the study will not be replaced. 3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1 Study Duration for Subjects 
Including the screening, study treatment (double-blind treatment and open-label ), and 
follow -up, the maximal total duration of study participation for a subject will be 56 weeks . 
After signing the informed consent, subjects should be randomized after 4 weeks 
(± 1 week) of screening.  
3.5.[ADDRESS_90789] ELIGIBILITY  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study

estradiol levels (< 5 ng/dL) or according to the definition of "postmenopausal 
range" for the laboratory involved  
 Acceptable methods of effective birth control include: 
− true sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods ], declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception]),  
− surgical contraceptive methods (vasectomy or bilateral tubal 
ligation/occlusion),  
− use of hormonal birth control methods (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable),  
− intrauterine devices , 
−  intrauterine hormonal releasing system , or  
− 2 barrier methods (each partner must use 1 barrier method) and at least [ADDRESS_90803] include spermicide (males must use a condom; females 
must choose either a d iaphragm OR c ervical cap OR c ontraceptive sponge). 
If spermicide is not available in the country or region, the 2-barrier method 
without spermicide is acceptable.  
Note:  Additional medications given during treatment with evolocumab may alter 
the contraceptive requirements. These additional medications may require an increase in the number of contraceptive methods, the change in type of 
contraceptive methods and/or length of time that contraception is to be utilized or 
length of time breastfeeding is to be avoided. The investigator is to discuss these contraceptive changes with the study  subject.

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board /independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC ) approval of the protocol, informed consent form (ICF) , and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2). All 
subjects must personally sign and date the ICF  before commencement of study specific 
activities/procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled upon randomization. The investigator is to document 
this decision and date, in the subject’s medical record and in the enrollment case report 
form ( CRF). 
Each subject who enter s into the screening period for the study ( defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the ICF ) receive s a unique subject identification number before 
any study -related activities /procedures are performed. The subject identification number 
will be assigned via IVRS/I WRS. This number will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that 
subject. 
Subjects who are unable to complete or meet eligibility on initial screening will be 
permitted to re-screen, except for subjects who do not meet inclusion criterion 107

7.5 Antibody Testing Procedures 
Blood sample(s) for antibody testing are to be collected at the time points shown in Table 3  for the measurement of anti -evolocumab binding antibodies . Samples testing 
positive for binding antibodies will also be tested for neutralizing antibodies and may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune complexes. Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out anti -evolocumab 
antibodies during the study.  
7.6 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarker development can be useful in developi[INVESTIGATOR_83307], guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity . [COMPANY_010] may attempt to 
develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to respond positively or negatively to evolocumab. 
Blood samples are to be collected for  biomarker development at d ay 1, week 12, 
week  24, and week 52. Refer to the laboratory manual for detailed collection and 
handling procedures for all biomarker development samples.

(DNA) analyses may be performed. These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on 
inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or 
responsiveness to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44809] . The goals of the optional studies 
include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of cardiovascular disease, 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_21877]/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response to evolocumab. 
7.8 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 ) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects . This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study . This can also include, 
but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and 
analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage. Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study . Results are stored in a secure database to ensure 
confidential ity. 
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], [COMPANY_010] can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the  
underlying inflammatory conditions , the dose response and/or prediction of respons e to 
evolocumab , and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, 
metabolites). Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study . Sampl es can be retained for up to

Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  [ADDRESS_90848]’s medical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties , except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by [CONTACT_21947]. Following the request from the subject, the i nvestigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed. 
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed. 
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_11337].  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the i nvestigator , at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]) . If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product. The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample. See 
Section 11.[ADDRESS_90849] s’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their  future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving IP 
and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83308] . If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the 
subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation from IP or other protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83309] S chedule 
of Assess ments  (Table 3 ) and collection of data, including endpoints and adverse 
events. T he investigator  must document the change to the Schedule of Assessments

physicians, from review of the medical records ).  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882] , and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation. Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publicly available data 
can be included after withdrawal of consent. The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  
8.2 Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw  or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion 
The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from IP and/or other 
protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], protocol procedures , or the study as a whole at any time 
prior to study completion.

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definition of Safety Events 
9.1.1 Disease-r elated Events 
Disease-related events are events (serious or non-serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease. In this study, subjects are at risk for or 
are known to have cardiovascular disease. Therefore, disease-related events potentially 
include manifestations and complications of atherosclerotic vascular disease such as coronary artery disease, angina, MI , ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid 
artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and testing suggesting progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Such events do not meet the definition of an adverse 
event unless assessed to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.  
Disease-related events and/or disease related outcomes that do not qualify as adverse events or serious adverse events:  
• An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease 
progression i n oncology or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44814]) is to be 
reported as a disease-related event.  
• Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event CRF.  
A disease-related event that would qualify as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event is an event based on the underlying disease that is worse than expected as 
assessed by [CONTACT_44910]’s condition or an event for which the investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the investigational 
product(s)/study treatment/protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21887]. This must be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_90851]’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. 
Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more  than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected. A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more than 
anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves an 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 46 of 73 
intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , is 
not considered an adverse event.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event. In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33206], refer to Section 8.1 for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83310] .  
The criteria for grade 4 in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events  (CTCAE) grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for serious adverse 
events. It is left to the Investigator’s judgment to report these grade 4 abnormalities as 
serious adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Worsening of HIV Disease 
HIV worsening will be captured as an adverse event. Because evolocumab is not 
expected to have any interaction with antiretroviral therapy or viral load or 
consequences of HIV infection, no specific actions with respect to study participation (including investigational product) are expected of the investigator. Should a subject’s viral load change or HIV infection worsen, the investigator is 
expected to manage HIV infection or any other concomitant illnesses per his or 
her clinical judgment. Background lipid-lowering therapy is expected to be stable. However, in the case of HIV worsening, because of potential drug– drug interaction 
between statins and antiretroviral therapy, changing background lipid-lowering 
therapy is left to the judgment of the investigator. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_90852]:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  [ADDRESS_90853] 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a disease-related event 
provided in Section 9.1.1): 
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
A disease-related event is to be reported as a serious adverse event if: 
• the subject’s pre-existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a patient with the same underlying condition, or  
•  if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the 
IMP/protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75587],  
• and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria above. 
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ” if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay) .  
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event.” Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

9.2.2 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That Do Not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
Adverse events possibly  related to study procedures, adverse device effects and 
serious adverse events are reported from signing of the ICF. All other adverse 
events are reported from the time of randomization. The investigator is responsible 
for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator or reported by [CONTACT_83350] /safety follow -up, or [ADDRESS_90856] assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), 
• Severity,  
• Assessment of relatedness to IP, the AMD (or A I/pen), or other protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
• Action taken. 
The adverse event grading scale used will be the CTCAE . The grading scale used in this 
study is described in Appendix  A. 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the IP, the 
AMD (or AI/pen), or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . This relationship is indicated by a 
“yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249], the AMD (or A I/pen), or other protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ?” Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a 
relationship between investigational product and the event. 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity (eg, administration of IP , protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], device[s] 
and/or procedure [including any screening procedure(s)]) . This relationship is indicated 
by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by a study activity (eg, administration of investigational 
product, protocol -requir ed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], device[s]), and/or procedure?”  Relatedness

findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events . However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events . Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event. 
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
[CONTACT_83351]/safety follow -up visit, or [ADDRESS_90858]’s medical record and are submitted to 
[COMPANY_010]. All serious adverse events must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure. This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure?”  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010]. All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_90859]:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  [ADDRESS_90860] be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by [CONTACT_21960]. Investigators will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to regulatory authorities in accordance with local requirements.  
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and GCP .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010], in accordance with 
local procedures and statutes.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event. See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form . For EDC 
studies where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via 
the Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available. 
In addition to the attributes listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS], the investigator must also complete 
the serious adverse event section of the Event CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol-required 
Reporting Period 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -required reporting period or after EOS. However, these serious adverse 
events can be reported to [COMPANY_010]. In some countries (eg, European Union [EU] member 
states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become 
aware of after EOS . If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report 
them to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event.

In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
monitor for pregnancies that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83313] 15 weeks after the end of treatment with evolocumab/placebo. 
The pregnancy should be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety  within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s  knowledge of the event of a pregnancy . Report a pregnancy on the 
Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C). [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety will 
follow -up with the investigator regarding additional information that may be requested.  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should attempt to obtain information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infant. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
serious adverse event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly), the investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event. 
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83314].  
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should report  
lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817]

10.1.2 Analysis Sets 
[IP_ADDRESS] Double-b lind Treatment Period 
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one 
dose of IP in the double- blind treatment period. This analysis set will be used in both 
efficacy and safety analyses. In efficacy analysis, subjects will be analyzed according to 
their randomized treatment group assignment. For safety analysis, subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group assignment except for the 
following case:  if a subject receives a treatment that is different than the randomized 
treatment assignment throughout the study, then this subject will be analyzed by [CONTACT_83352]. 
The completer analysis set (CAS) includes subjects in the FAS who adhered to the 
scheduled IP regimen in the double -blind treatment period and have observed value for 
the primary endpoints.

[IP_ADDRESS] Open-l abel Period 
The long-term analysis set (LAS) will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
open-label IP in the open-label  period. This analysis set will be used in all analyses for 
the open-label period. 
10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups 
 Baseline covariates include, but are not 
limited to: 
• Stratification  factors in Double-blind Treatment Period: 
− Statin use at baseline (yes/no)  
− Hepatitis C status (yes/no) 
• Age :  <65 year, ≥  65 years  
• Sex 
• Race  
• Study baseline LDL -C:  <median/≥median 
• Family history of premature coronary heart disease (yes/no) 
•  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations 
The planned sample size for the comparison between evolocumab 420 mg QM and 
placebo at a ratio of 2:[ADDRESS_90862] of evolocumab 420 mg QM compared to placebo 
and the corresponding 95% confidence interval at week 12 was -61.98% [-69.51%, 
-60.45%], with treatment effect ranges between -55.1%  and -62.33% from 
Studies  20110114, 20110115, and 20110117. The assumed treatment effect between 
the primary endpoint in evolocumab 420 mg QM is 40%, with a common standard 
deviation (SD) of 20%. This SD assumption is based on evolocumab phase 3 results. 
This sample size will provide approximately 99% power for the primary endpoint in 
testing the superiority of evolocumab dose regimen over placebo, assuming a dropout rate of 10%.  
In addition, 300 subjects in evolocumab 420 mg QM group  wil
 l provide approximately 
95% probability of detecti
ng adverse events that occur at a rate of 1%.

[IP_ADDRESS] Multiplicity Adjustment Method  
Methods of adjusting for multiplicity due to multiple endpoints (primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints) in order to preserve the familywise error rate at 0.05 are described in Figure 1 . 
Figure 1 .  Multiplicity Adjustment Methods  
 
The following method will  be used to preserve the family -wise error rate for the primary 
and secondary endpoints: 
1. If the treatment effect from the primary analysis of the primary endpoint is 
significant at a significance level of 0.05, statistical testing of the tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints will follow the Hochberg procedure at a significance level of 
0.005 (Hochberg, 1988) 
2. If all tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints are significant, the tier 2 secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be tested using the Hochberg procedure at a significance 
level of 0.05.  
3. If not all tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints are significant, the tier 2 secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be tested using the Hochberg procedure at a significance 
level of 0.045 (Wiens, 2003). 
Unless specified otherwise, all other hypothesis testing will be 2-sided with a significance 
level of 0.05.

10.5.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
To assess the primary endpoint of the mean percent change from baseline in LDL -C at 
week 24, a repeated measures linear effects model will be used on the FAS to compare 
the efficacy of evolocumab with placebo. The repeated measures model will include 
terms for treatment group, stratification factors, scheduled visit and the interaction of 
treatment with scheduled visit. Missing values will not be imputed for primary analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analysis  
To evaluate the robustness of the analysis results, sensitivity analyses will be performed 
as follows: 
• The primary analysis will be repeated using the CAS  
• Non-parametric analyses will be performed  
• A sensitivity analysis under the assumption that subjects who discontinued IP with 
missing endpoint data have a mean zero percent change from baseline will be conducted.
 
Subgroup Analysis  
If applicable, subgroup analyses on the primary endpoint will be conducted using the 
stratification factors or baseline covariates.  
10.5.3 Secondary Efficacy  Endpoint s 
The statistical model and testing of the tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints will be similar  
to the primary analysis of primary endpoints. The secondary endpoint of LDL -C 
response (50% reduction of LDL -C from baseline and achievement of target 
LDL-C < 70 mg/d Las defined in secondary endpoint section) will be analyzed using the 
Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test adjusted by [CONTACT_83353].  
Analysis of the tier 2 secondary efficacy endpoints will use the same analysis model as 
the tier 1 endpoints.  
Multiplicity adjustment procedures are defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

Adverse Event Grading Scale 
Refer to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.0. The CTCAE is available at the following link:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
Reporting 
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL according to the criteria specified in  Section 6.3 require the following: 
• The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours  of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment-emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the [COMPANY_010].  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation 
All subjects in whom IP or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are withheld (either permanently 
or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Sections  6.3.1 and 6.3.2 or are to 
undergo a period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the 
subject’s baseline levels . Assessments that are to  be performed during this period 
include: 
• AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin (total and direct) is to be repeated within 24 hours   
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN, retesting of liver tests, and bilirubin (total and direct) is to 
be performed every [ADDRESS_90877]:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 68 of 73 
Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or t he IP  or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been discontinued AND the 
subject is asymptomatic . 
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL: 
− Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess for eosinophi lia 
− Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody ( ANA), Anti 
Smooth Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 ( LKM1 ) to 
assess for autoimmune hepatitis 
− Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− Obtain a more detailed history of:   
• Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness 
• Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
• Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and fever  
• Prior an d/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
• Concomitant use of medications (including non-prescription medicines and 
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Obtain viral serologies  
− Obtain CPK, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and peripheral blood smear  
− Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated 
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis if this has not already been collected  
• Obtain hepatology consult ( liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, and TBL) until all laboratory 
abnormalities return to baseline or normal . The “close observation period” is to 
continue for a minimum of [ADDRESS_90878]:  Evolocumab

Protocol Title:  A Double Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Multicenter 
Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy on LDL-C of Evolocumab

BEIJERINCK: evolocumaB Effect on LDL-C lower Ing in subJE cts with human 
immunodeficiency viR us and INcreased Cardiovascular risK 
 
Amendment Date: 30 January  2017 
Rationale: 
Regulatory agencies had expressed concerns that HIV -positive subjects without clinical 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with LDL ≥ 70 mg/dL but ≤ 100 mg/dL 
would be eligible to this study . The protocol was amended to address the regulators’ 
concerns. Per this amendment, s ubjects with clinical ASCVD  disease with LDL 
≥ 70 mg/dL are eligible for this study . For subjects without clinical ASCVD, LDL must be 
≥ 100 mg/dL. 
Additionally, regulators suggested that a subpopulation of subjects not on statin 
background therapy be included in this study . They also inquired about a prespecified 
size for that subpopulation that would allow for generalizability of the study results . 
Feasibility analysis  suggest that such a population is very small in clinical practice . For 
this study, per amendment, we will aim to enroll a subpopulation of subjects needing 
lipid-lowering therapy but not on statin therapy, congruent with the reality of clinical 
practice. We anticipate this subpopulation not on statin therapy  to be about 10% . In the 
protocol, a size for this subpopulati on is not prespecified, but text was added regarding 
stratification of randomization by [CONTACT_83358]. The European Medicines Agency  did not mandate a cap or 
subgroup size.  
This amendment also clarifies the definition of statin intolerance in inclusion 
criterion 106.

Date:  [ADDRESS_90884] current 
[COMPANY_010] guidelines . The electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency form 
(Appendix  B) was replaced with the current version of the form.  
Further, to address how HIV worsening will be classified, a section was added to clarify 
that HIV worsening will be recorded as an adverse event. In the case of HIV worsening, 
because of potential drug– drug interaction between statins and antiretroviral therapy, 
changing background lipid-lowering therapy is left to the judgment of the investigator. 
In addition to these changes , the pregnancy test s chedule was revised to address 
regulatory agency concerns, and details  were provided to clarify when serum and urine 
pregnancy tests will be performed.  
Minor administrative and typographical changes were made throughout the protocol .

Add:  
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Worsening of HIV Disease 
HIV worsening will be captured as an adverse event . Because evolocumab is not 
expected to have any interaction with antiretroviral therapy or viral load or 
consequences of HIV infection, no specific actions with respect to study 
participation (including investigational product) are expected of the investigator . 
Should a subject’s viral load change or HIV infection worsen, the investigator is 
expected to manage HIV infection or any other concomitant illnesses per his or her clinical judgment . Background lipid-lowering therapy is expected to be stable. 
However, in the case of HIV worsening, because of potential dr ug–drug interaction 
between statins and antiretroviral therapy, changing background lipid-lowering therapy is left to the judgment of the investigator.

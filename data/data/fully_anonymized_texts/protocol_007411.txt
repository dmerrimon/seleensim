[ADDRESS_405846] demonstrated propranolol serum concentrations of 20 ng/ml (range 0.16-0.26 ng/ml) (Sloan, personal communication) with sustained-release propranolol 0.5mg over 21 days to be effective in beta- blockade mediated mitigation of stress -
induced tumor progression/metasta ses.
27 Animal to human dosing may be converted 
using the dose translation formula based on body surface area where human equivalent dose (HED) (mg/kg) = animal dose (mg/kg) multiplied by [CONTACT_328629] K m/Human K m 
(where animal K m = 3, human K m = 37).
28 The HED is  122 mg/day or 142 mg/day for a 
60 kg and 70 kg human, respectively. However, the 0.5 mg dose is not a single-dose; therefore, with the sustained-release formulation the HED could be as low as 6 mg/day or 7 mg/day, respectively. The actual HED is likely near the midpoint of the low and high values calculated, which would be [ADDRESS_405847] cancer progression. Bo th 20mg and 40mg of propranolol 
(one administration of a twice daily administration regimen) are effective for anxiolysis.
[ADDRESS_405848] preny lation of Rap1. 
 
1.4 Rationale 
 
This study will explore whether prenylation of Rap1 - recently identified as being under beta- adrenergic control - may be affected by [CONTACT_57134]-blocker use. Further, the proposed 
study addresses a major goal of the MCW Cancer Cen ter; it promotes collaborative 
interactions between basic science researchers and clinicians at the Medical College. The proposed investigation of Rap1 prenylation will enhance the translational significance of [CONTACT_328633]’ s studies of Rap1 and may lead to future clinical trials of beta -
blockers as novel therapeutic regulators of Rap1 in cancer.

 8 2.1 Primary Objective 
 
The primary objective of this ancillary study is to explore whether beta- blocker 
administration will promote prenylation and membrane localization of Rap1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).    
2.[ADDRESS_405851] the 
documentation of patient consent and proceed with registration procedures. All source 
documents that support eligibility including a signed informed consent/HIPAA and signed eligibility checklis t, will be available, reviewed  and eligibility verified . At the 
point of registration, a member of the study team  will register the patient in the electronic 
database, including demographics, consent and on- study information. The patient will be 
assigned a unique sequence number for the study. The principal investigator (PI) of the study, [CONTACT_182348], will be notified prior to enrollment.  If at any point in time a patient wishes to withdraw from the study, they may notify [CONTACT_182348] verbally or in writing. There will be no further data collection for participants who elect to withdraw from the study.  
 Target enrollment is  40 (20 per group) and includes patients undergoing autologous HCT 
for MM at MCW. H alf of the participants in the parent study will be randomized via 
permuted block assignment with random block sizes to receive propranolol upon study entry. Informed consent will be obtained  to access participants’ full medical records to 
ascertain relevant demographic and medical data as outlined in Section 4.2. The patient must have signed informed consent prior to registration on both studies. Due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_328627], the need to monitor response to prophylactic beta-

blot analysis, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_328628]. Patients will be enrolled  by [CONTACT_2006] -7.. 
Total study duration will be up to 7 weeks for participants assigned to the in tervention 
group ( [ADDRESS_405852]-transplant) and 5 weeks for those in 
the control arm ([ADDRESS_405853]- transplant). Additional 
clinical information will be collected for [ADDRESS_405854]-transplant a s identified in section 
[IP_ADDRESS].

Same as the parent study  
 
4.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Same as parent study.  
 
4.4 Specimen C ollection  
 The Cancer Center Lab will draw  one tube of blood to be stored in 8 mL BD Vacutainer 
CPT tubes at three study time points as described in Table 4.7b. These time points include baseline ( Day -7), Day -2 (immediately prior to transplant , central line placement, 
or administration of any conditioni ng regimen ), and Day +28. Blood will be drawn at one 
of two locations: in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (if participants are immediately post-transplant and/or still or re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) or in the transplant clinic during their regular visits. These [ADDRESS_405855]. Williams' lab at MCW for Western 
blot analysis. Before being transferred  they will be assigned a dummy ID that will be the 
sole identifier of the samples. The linked identifiers will be stored on a secure computer network through the Clinical Trials Office under the PI’s name.  
 
4.5 Rap1 prenylation 
 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated from the whole blood samples collected from patients at the three designated time points (Baseline, Day -2, and 
Day + 28). Members of [CONTACT_328633]’ laboratory (Professor, Pharmacology and 
Toxicology, MCW) will conduct western blotting on the cytosolic and membrane fractions of isolated PBMCs to determine the distribution of Rap1 in the different fractions, and the status of Rap1 prenylation in the cells.

 12 5.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
5.1 Study D esign  
 
5.1.1 Accrual  
 
It is estimated that 9 months – 1 year will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  
 5.1.2 Primary Endpoint  The primary endpoint is Day +28 (4 weeks) following HCT for MM, with intervention 
arm patients followed for an additional 1-[ADDRESS_405859] 30 patients with a 
complete set of prenylation data. A targeted final sample of 15 participants in the 
intervention group will be sufficient for Western blot analysis. This sample size is 
established for the purpose of the parent study and should be sufficient to describe prenylation.  
5.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
  
5.3.1 Rap1 prenylation by [CONTACT_57134]-blocker exposure  Western blotting on the cytosolic and membrane fractions of isolated PBMCs will determine the distribution of Rap1 in the different fractions as well as the status of Rap1 prenylation in the cells exposed vs. not exposed to beta-blocker therapy. The statistical difference between cells from patients exposed to beta-blocker therapy (intervention arm) vs. those not exposed to beta- blocker therapy (control arm) will be determined by 
[CONTACT_491] -measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) individually at the two blood 
assessment time points on beta -blocker therapy (Day -2, and Day +30). Baseline Rap1 
prenylation will also be assessed by [CONTACT_328630].  Patients will be included in final analyses if and only if they have been 
adherent to the study drug during the designated time period as described in the parent protocol.

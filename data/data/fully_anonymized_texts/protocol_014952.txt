 Version 6.9.[ADDRESS_1180427] and Study Design:  
This is a randomized, parallel -group, double -blind,  phase 2, single center, proof –of-concept 
study which will evaluate the effect of a propriatory mixed preparation of FDA approved allergens 
(PMA) used as a sub -cutaneously administered immunotherapy for the management of allergic 
rhinitis (perennial and seasonal). Participating study s ubjects will be required to manifest the signs 
and symptoms of allergic rhinitis and test positive to at least six allergens using a multi  
aeroallergen screen at the time of study recruitment . All subjects will undergo standard allergen 
skin prick testin g using six Multi -Test® PC skin prick test devices  (Lincoln Diagnostics, Decator, 
IL) or comparable skin testing technique for a total of [ADDRESS_1180428] clinical 
response , physician global assessment , and medication use . A safety assessment will be 
undertaken one month following completion of treatment.  
At the screening visit (Screening Visit) a poten tial study subject will be required to fulfill the 
requirements of the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, will have a clinical evaluation including 
medical history and physical examination, blood draw and performance of skin testing. The study 
subject  will then abstain from using intranasal steroids and antihistamines for two weeks and then 
return to the clinic for administration of sub -cutaneous PMA and post -treatment in -clinic safety 
evaluation. The latter evaluation period will comprise approximatel y [ADDRESS_1180429]’s response to PMA immunotherapy. Follow up clinic study visits will continue 
bi-weekly through [ADDRESS_1180430] will receive increasing 
doses of PMA immunotherapy and will be eva luated for safety. Twice weekly clinical evaluation 
will also be performed. Following the final administration of PMA immunotherapy, a one month 
follow -up safety and clinical efficacy evaluation will be conducted by [CONTACT_848974]. 
The duration  of the study will be approximately 14 weeks.  
Primary Objectives:  
To evaluate whether there is a difference in the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe 
allergic rhinitis when treated with a propriatory mixed preparation of FDA approved allergens, 
admi nistered sub -cutaneously over a [ADDRESS_1180431] 
of care.  
Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objectives of this study are to quantify allergy medication use and adverse 
events. Serum will also be stored to evalu ate changes in IgE and IgG subclasses.

 Efficacy Analyses  
The intent -to-treat approach will be used. Baseline characteristics (those collected prior to 
randomization) will be described using mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and 
medians and ranges for discrete variables.  
The primary efficacy variable is the chang e in symptoms at the end of the periods of PMA or 
placebo study drug administration. The p -value, least square (LS) treatment means, difference 
between the LS treatment means, and 95% confidence intervals for the treatment differences will 
be presented.  
The secondary efficacy variables are rescue medication requirement  and adverse events . These 
changes will be analyzed similarly to that of the primary efficacy variable.  
The percentage of subjects stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_848925], and the groups will be compared using 
Fisher’s exact test.  
Sample Size Justification:   
The study sample size is based upon the results of prior immunotherapy investigations 
undertaken by [CONTACT_848977] & 
Clinical Immunology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Efficacy for immunotherapy 
was estimated to be 80% for treatmet group and 30% for placebo. Using an error rate ( ) of 0 .05 
and 80% Power we calculate a total sample size needed of 28 subjects. To account for drop off we 
will recruit up to 36 subjects.

 3.0 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Background  
Allergic rhinitis and asthma  
Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common chronic disorders, with reported prevalence 
ranging from 3% to 19% (1). It is a heterogeneous disorder that includes seasonal AR (SA R) 
symptoms (‘hay fever’) and, perennial AR (PAR). The comprehensive review of Kay and 
colleagues reports that SAR is found in approximately 10% of the general population and PAR in 
10% to 20%. (2).  
Clinical symptoms of AR include runny nose, itching, sne ezing and nasal congestion. More than 
80% of persons with allergic asthma have AR and AR is a risk factor for the development of 
asthma. Hence, there is a significant comorbidity between asthma and AR which is not surprising 
since there is an uninterrupted  air passage from the nose to the alveolar ducts of the lungs. The 
clearest connection between AR and asthma is based on a shared immunologic response to an 
identified foreign substance. The term often used for the response is ‘allergy’, and the foreign 
substance is an allergen. Kay (2 ) notes that when Clemens von Pi[INVESTIGATOR_848927] 1906, he had applied it to the reactivity found in both prote ctive immunity and 
hypersensitivity. However, allergy is now identified with the type 1 hypersensitivity disorder of 
the immune system associated with immunoglobulin E (IgE).  
Triggers for epi[INVESTIGATOR_848928], airborne pollens, dust mites, animal dander, 
molds that induce IgE production. The inflammatory response is similar for both AR and asthma; 
they share a similar respi[INVESTIGATOR_848929] ( 6). The pathophysiology of local mediator release, systemic immune 
response and eosinophil recruitment are alike. During the early -phase response, sy mptoms in 
patients with AR typi[INVESTIGATOR_848930], rhinorrhea and conjunctivitis; patients with asthma 
experience wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath, in addition to objectively demonstrable 
changes in lung function. There is a similar patter n and time course of early - and late -phase 
responses in AR and asthma. Approximately 1 hour after allergen provocation, patients with AR 
experience a peak in symptoms, while patients with asthma experience a steep decline in lung 
function, measured by [CONTACT_848978][INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (FEV 1). During the late -phase 
response, nasal congestion is sustained in patients with AR, while a prolonged fall in lung function 
is again observed in patients with asthma. Within 12 h to 24 h, both types of reactions may resolve.  
Sub-cutaneous allergen immunotherapy

 Allergen immunotherapy by [CONTACT_17838] (desensitization or hyposensitisation) consists of an 
induction course of injections of increasing doses of the allergen extract, usually given weekly or 
bi-weekly. The main tenance phase of maximum dosage injections usually lasts between three to 5 
years (7). Injections can consist of single or mixed allergen extracts.  As reported in a recent 
Cochrane Re view, speciﬁc allergen immunotherapy (SIT) for hay fever is widely considered to be 
effective where grass pollen, ragweed, and birch pollen are causal agents, and there is evidence 
that its efﬁcacy may continue for many years beyond the treatment period (8 ). The review 
concludes that speciﬁc allergen injection immunotherapy is a safe and efﬁcacious treatment in 
reducing symptom severity and the requirement for anti -allergic medication in AR. In view of the 
occasional occurrence of systemic side effects foll owing injections, it is customary that injection 
immunotherapy is performed in the immediate presence of a physician and administered by 
[CONTACT_848979].  
3.[ADDRESS_1180441] three decades in the clinical practice observations of some 20,000 patients 
as undertaken by [CONTACT_941] “inventor” of the treatment paradigm, William J. Freeman, MD, a Johns 
Hopkins University School o f Medicine graduate and Diplomate of The American Board of 
Otolaryngology.  
The intrinsic difference of the Freeman technique, compared to currently used methodologies of 
sub-cutaneous immunotherapy for AR, is that a wide -spectrum propriatory mixture of 60  different 
FDA approved allergens (referenced above as PMA), refined over multiple years of clinical testing 
and observation, is used for the immunotherapy. In part due to the significantly lower dose of each 
active allergen, this form of immunotherapy has  demonstrated an excellent clinical safety profile 
and not one single anaphylactoid response has been noted with the use of this propriatory mixture 
in decades of use and development.  
Current sub -cutaneous immunotherapy for the management of AR typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] c onsist of the use of a 
limited number of relevant antigens (grass pollen, tree pollen, ragweed pollen, dust mites,etc.). 
Hence, the propriatory antigen mixture that will be used in this investigation that uses  more than  
[ADDRESS_1180442] for potency, 
maintained by [CONTACT_848980]. The precise selection of

 antigens, t he quantitative amount of the latter in the propriatory mixture and the preparation of 
three allergenic solutions of “vaccine” for immunotherapy are propriatory intellectual property.

clinical response of active PMA immunotherapy compared to the placebo treatment. The  Total 
Nasal Symptoms Score (TNSS) will be used to generate daily symptom scores. The total combined 
daily symptom and medication score (DCS) will be used as  the primary  validated assessment.  
4.1.2 Secondary Objective  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are mini -Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionaire 
(RQLQ) and safety assessment. Serum will also be stored to evaluate changes in IgE and IgG

 5.0 STUDY DESIGN AND MET HODS  
5.1 Study Design  
This is a phase 2 proof of concept study. It is being undertaken to characterize and quantify the 
clinical difference in signs and symptoms that may  evolve when subjects with active SAR/PAR 
are administered a sub -cutaneous form of immunotherapy in a double -blind, prospective, 
controlled six weeks study wherein a PMA is compared with saline placebo.  
Randomization to active PMA versus placebo treatment  is on a 1 to 1 ratio. A double -blind study 
design is used to minimize outcome bias.  Randomization measures to minimize bias at study entry 
include computerized random assigment of treatment versus placebo vials.  
Subjects who are receiving nasal steroids for their SAR/PAR at screening may continue in the 
screening process if they agree to discontinue their therapy and comence a 14 day wash -out period 
of their medication prior to receiving active/placebo immunotherapy. Potential study subjects 
who, at scree ning, are not on active treatment for their SAR/PAR and asthma may enter directly 
into the investigation provided they fulfil entry and exclusion criteria and screening testing 
requirements.   
The population to be studied consists of male and female adults  aged 18 years to 65 years who are 
actively manifesting SAR/PAR have a score of at least [ADDRESS_1180444] three decades, in some 20 ,000 patients by [CONTACT_848981] (see 3.2). In clinical 
evaluation this patented antigen mixture has provided clinical symptomatic relief to patients with 
SAR/PAR in as brief a period as three administrations of immunotherapy injections and has  an 
observed overall success rate of approximately [ADDRESS_1180445] -treatment safety follow up assessment at one month 
following the final administration of immunotherapy. All doses of immunotherapy will be 
administered in the study site clinic by [CONTACT_848982].

5.2 Justification for Study Design, Dose, and Endpoints  
The question to be answered scientifically by [CONTACT_848983] a new innovative , 
patented mixture of FDA appro ved antigens provides unequivocal superior clinical benefit in the 
symptomatic relief of individuals manifesting active SAR/PAR. Since extensive prior experience 
of managing patients with these medical conditions has demonstrated remarkable benefit from th e 
immunotherapy technique within 3 to 6 weeks, the selection of study subjects and the overall study 
design can be scientifically justified.  
The dose of immunotherapy, which will be administered sub -cutaneously bi -weekly for 8 weeks, 
will be the same for all subjects and will begin with vial number #[ADDRESS_1180446] concentrated vial (#1).  
The study sample size is based upon the results of prior immunotherapy investigations undertaken 
by [CONTACT_737] s of this study and their colleagues in the Division of Allergy & Clinical 
Immunology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Efficacy for immunotherapy was

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Investigational immunotherapy  
The investigational immunotherapy used in this study protocol will be p repared by [CONTACT_848989] 
(DACI) a national reference laboratory facility according to institutional policy and in accordance 
with USP 797 compounding standards. The al lergens that will be used to constitute the study 
immunotherapy solutions will be directly shipped by [CONTACT_848990], Lenoir NC [ZIP_CODE] -0800 and Allergy Laboratories, Oklahoma, City. All allergens 
used in the compou nding of study immunotherapy solutions will be FDA approved materials.  
Sterile saline, used for the production of the study placebo solution will be supplied by [CONTACT_848991]. A comparable amount of glycerin and phenol as well as histami ne will be 
added to the placebo vials to mimic any local irritant reactions that may occur in the active 
treatment vials.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Storage  
Investigational immunotherapy solutions and placebo saline solutions will be refrigerated at [ADDRESS_1180460] be maintained every working day.  
7.1.4 Immunotherapy Dose and Regimen   
Recruited subjects alternate to be assigned either treatment set I or II (representing either placebo 
or active PMA treatment in a binde d fashion). The assigned treatment set will remain for the 
duration of the study for each subject. On the day of an injection, 0.3ml from each of the 
appropriate vial set  mix (A-C)  will be combined in a sterile 5 ml bottle. Using a new sterile 
syringe, 0. 15-0.60ml of the PMA solution or placebo will be removed for injection purposes 
according to the injection schedule (Appendix I).   A sterile 27G ½ inch  syringe will be used for 
administration. Immunotherapy will be adminitered bi -weekly in the study clini c for a total of 
eight consecutive weeks. Appendix I lists the precise immunotherapy injection schedule.  
 
All patients are required to remain in the clinic under close observation by [CONTACT_848992] a

 It is important to note that the maximum concentration of each individual allergen is quite low 
compared to more traditional immunotherapy regimens. The maximum PNU/ml (Protien Ni trogen 
Units) in vial #1 will be no more than about 180 PNU/ml per allergen (eg 0.9ml of 20,000 PNU/ml 
stock material into 100ml solution). In most cases the actual concentration of each stock allegen is 
much lower than 20,0000 PNU/ml since the material ma y be provided as a mixture of several 
allergens. We would estimate therefore that subjects would receive no more than about 7.[ADDRESS_1180462] injection (0.2ml Vial #2). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], allergens are administered 
via immunotherapy in a range of about 2000 PNU.  Thus the dosage of each allergen is less than 
0.36% of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_848933]. The lower overall dosing scheme provided in 
this study would therefore be considered to be extremely safe with minimal adverse even ts.

according to the study protocol.  
All cases of over dose (with or without associated AEs) will be documented on an Overdose page 
of the CRF, in order to capture this important safety information consistently in the database. 
Cases of overdose without manifested signs or symptoms are not considered AEs. AEs associated 
with an overdose will be documented on an AE CRF according to Section 9.0, Pretreatment Events 
and Adverse Events.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with overdose should be reported according t o the 
procedure outlined in Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_1180464]’s clinical entry 
diagnostic criteria (see 6.1).   
Subjects will be assigned to receive their treatment according to the randomization schedule 
provided to the study site by [CONTACT_848993]. The immunotherapy ID Num ber 
will be entered onto the study subject’s CRF. All study immunotherapy will be administered to the 
study subjects while they are in the study site clinic.  
Investigational immunotherapy blind maintenance will be undertaken by [CONTACT_848994]. During regularly scheduled monitoring visits, a study monitor from the sponsor or a 
designee will perform an inventory of blinded investigational immunotherapy solutions. All

 PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE . 
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:  
 Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs or 
symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or 
symptom(s) should be recorded appropriately as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).  
Pre-existing conditions:  
 Pre-existing conditions (present at the time of signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluations (eg, laboratory test s, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless

Protocol: Novel biologic  therapy for allergic rhinitis  
 Version 6.9.[ADDRESS_1180482] experiences a worsening or complication 
of such a concurrent condition, the worsening or complication should be recorded 
appropriately as a PTE (worsening or complication occurs before start of study medication) or 
an AE (worsening or complication occurs after start of study medication). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening 
of…”).  
 If a subject has a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_174343] (eg, gout, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_4070], serious or 
severe in nature, that is, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condition from Baseline (eg “worsening of…”).  
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:  
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study medication, the worsening or comp lication should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition 
(eg, “worsening of…”).  
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in study 
medication, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening 
of…”).  
Changes in severity of AEs /Serious PTEs:  
 If the subject experiences  changes in severity of an AE/serious PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum severity recorded.  
Preplanned surgeries or procedures:  
 Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
informed consent are  not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
performed early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -existing condition, the 
worsening of the condition should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complications 
resulting from any planned surgery should be reported as AEs.  
Elective surgeries or procedures:  
 Elective procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condition 
should not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the sub ject’s source 
documents. Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be reported as AEs.

 Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):  
 Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic action, should NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of pre -existing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.  
Overdose:  
 Cases of overdose with the immunotherapy without manifested side effects are NOT 
considered PTEs or AEs, but instead will be doc umented on an Overdose page of the CRF. 
Any manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE 
page of the CRF.

PTEs that fulfill 1 or more of the serious criteria above are also to be considered SAEs and should 
be reported and followed up in the same manner (see Sections 9.2.2  and 9.3). 
It is important to note that out of more than 20,[ADDRESS_1180484] included mild -moderate local swelling. These mild reactions occur at 
a rate of less than 20 percent.  
9.1.5 Severity of PTEs a nd AEs  
The different categories of intensity (severity) are characterized as follows:  
Mild:  The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].   
Moderate:  The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual 
activities.  
Seve re: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.  
9.1.6 Causality of AEs  
The relationship of each AE to study immunotherapy will be assessed using the following 
categories:  
Related:  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from administration of the 
immunotherapy (including the course after withdrawal of the study 
immunotherapy), or for which possible involvement of the immunotherapy 
cannot be ruled out , although factors other than the immunotherapy, such as 
underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs and concurrent 
treatments, may also be responsible.

Protocol: Novel biologic  therapy for allergic rhinitis  
 Version 6.9.1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL PROPERTY OF RELEZ THERAPEUTICS, LLC  
 Not Related:  An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the immunotherapy and/or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_40131], 
such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs and concurrent 
treatments.  
9.1.7 Relationship to Study Procedures  
Relationship (causality) to study procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.  
The relationship should be assessed  as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibility that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related.  
9.1.8 Start Date  
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first sig ns/symptoms were noted by [CONTACT_14426]/or physician.  
9.1.9 Stop Date  
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died.  
9.1.10  Frequency  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_11742]/PTE (eg, vomiting) or those which o ccur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.  
9.1.11  Action Concerning Study Medication  
 Stop immunotherapy – the study immunotherapy is stopped due to the particular AE.  
 Immunotherapy not changed – the parti cular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_848940].  
 Unknown – only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.  
 Not Applicable – the immunotherapy was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE eg, 
the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with the study immunotherapy was 
already stopped before the onset of the AE.  
9.1.12  Outcome  
 Recovered/Resolved – Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.  
 Recovering/Resolving – the inte nsity is lowered by [CONTACT_1734]: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptoms has almost disappeared; the abnormal laboratory value improved, but has not

 returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condition remaining “recovering/resolving”.  
 Not recovered/not resolved – there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosis, signs/ symptoms or laboratory value on the last day of the observed 
study period has g ot worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died from another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved”.  
 Resolved with sequelae – the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was l eft with 
permanent/significant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis.  
 Fatal – the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause of death.  
 Unknown – the course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to hosp ital change or 
residence change at the end of the subject’s participation in the study.  
9.2 Procedures  
9.2.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PTE and AE Collection Period  
Collection of PTEs will commence from the time the subject signs the informed consent to 
partici pate in the study and continue until the subject is first administered study immunotherapy  
(visit 2) or until screen failure. For subjects who discontinue prior to study immunotherapy 
administration, PTEs are collected until the subject discontinues study  participation.  
Collection of AEs will commence from the time that the subject is first administered study 
immunotherapy (visit 2). Routine collection of AEs will continue until visit 14 .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PTE and AE Reporting  
At each study visit, the investigator will as sess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral question, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” may be asked. 
Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. Subjects experiencing a 
serious PTE must be mo nitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory values have returned to baseline or there is a satisfactory explanation for the change. 
Non-serious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study, need not to be followed -up for  the purposes of 
the protocol.  
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study 
immunotherapy or not, must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant 
changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or until there is a satisfactory explanation

 12.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to unblinding of subject’s 
treatment assignment. This document will provi de further details regarding the definition of 
analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives.  
A blind data review will be conducted prior to unblinding of subject’s treatment assignment. This 
review will assess the accuracy an d completeness of the study database, subject evaluability, and 
appropriateness of the planned statistical methods.  
12.1.1  Analysis Sets  
All efficacy and safety analyses will be analyzed using the full analysis set (FAS). The FAS will 
consist of all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of double -blind study 
immunotherapy. Efficacy analyses will be analyzed according to the treatment received and safety 
analyses will be analyzed according to the actual treatment received.  
Unless otherwise spe cified, all statistical tests and confidence intervals will be two -sided and 
conducted at the 0.05 significance level.  
12.1.2  Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (eg, age, race, gender, height, weig ht, etc) will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics for all subjects and by [CONTACT_849002]. For 
categorical variables (eg, race, gender, etc) the number and percent of subjects in specified 
categories will be presented. Unless otherwise s pecified, descriptive statistics on continuous 
variables (eg, age, height, weight) will consist of the number of subjects (N), mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum.  
12.1.[ADDRESS_1180491] square (LS) treatment means, difference between the LS 
treatment means, and 95% confidence intervals for the treatment differences will be prese nted.  
The success of blinding will be assessed by [CONTACT_849003], i.e. active treatment or placebo. The results will be recorded at each 
study visit.  
Total Nasal Symptoms Score (TNSS) and th e Mini -RQLQ attached in Appendix F will be used to 
evaluate clinical efficacy. TNSS along with rescue medication use is recorded at home on a daily 
Propriatory antigen preparation   
Study Number: PMA  001  Page 51 of 84 
Protocol: Novel biologic  therapy for allergic rhinitis  
 Version 6.9.[ADDRESS_1180492] week. Higher sc ores indicate 
worse symptoms.  
 
The primary outcome measure is the average daily combined score (DCS) which is calculated by 
[CONTACT_849004] + average medication score as well as the mini -RQLQ at weeks 2,10 and 
14.  
 
Secondary outcomes will include  the adverse events rate and TNSS between both groups using a 
one-tailed Fischer’s exact test and/or unpaired t test.  
 
Other outcomes include baseline characteristics, use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and drop out between both 
treatment groups I and II using a one -tailed Fischer’s exact test and/or unpaired t test. T rend tests 
for comparison of both groups will be performed such as the Jonckheere -Terptsra trend test. A sum of 
Mann -Whitney -Wilcoxon tests may also be sensitive and reveal a mild trend. Other trend tests ma y 
also be used.  
A Kaplan -Meier or similar product limit estimator function will also be used to calculate the effect 
of treatment over time.  
 
Medications commonly used to treat allergic rhinitis such as nasal steroids , antih istamines, 
opthalmologic antihis tamines, cromolyn, azelastine, decongestants and other OTC allergy 
medications will be stopped during the [ADDRESS_1180493] daily medication scores between 
0-6.

double -blind immunotherapy and will be assigned to the treatment at the time of the event.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized using the full analysis set. Adverse events 
will be summarized using the MedDRA coding dictionary. In general, AEs will be tabulated at 
each of the following levels: overall summary (subject with at least 1 AE), the MedDRA system 
organ class (SOC) and the MedDRA preferred term (PT). Tabulations at each level of a term will 
present count (n) and percentage of subjects reporting  any event for that term. Subjects reporting 
more than one occurrence for the term (level) being summarized will be counted only once and 
assigned to the drug assignment at time of the event.  
Laboratory test variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_849005]. Laboratory data collected from baseline and up to [ADDRESS_1180495]’s last dose of study immunotherapy will be included in the analysis. Markedly abnormal 
laboratory values will be determi ned and listed by [CONTACT_2060]. The number and percentage of 
subjects with marked abnormality in each of the laboratory parameters will be presented.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize vital signs by [CONTACT_67486].  
Vital sign  data collected from baseline and up to a subject’s last dose of study immunotherapy will 
be included in the analysis.  
12.2 Interim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination  
No interim analyses are planned.  
12.3 Determination of Sample Size  
The study sample size i s based upon the results of prior immunotherapy investigations undertaken 
by [CONTACT_849006] & Clinical 
Immunology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Efficacy for immunotherapy was 
estimated to be 80% for treatmet group and 30% for placebo. Using an error rate ( ) of 0.05 and 
80% Power we calculate a total sample size needed of 28 subjects. To account for drop off we will 
recruit up to 36 subjects.

deviation from protocol -specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the sponsor or 
designee (and IRB, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be no 
exemptions for a prospectively approved deviation from the inclusion or exclusion criteria.  
The site should document all protocol deviations in the subject’s source documents. In the event of 
a significant deviation, the site should notify  the sponsor or its designee (and IRB, as required). 
Significant deviations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or misconduct, 
increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study assessment. A 
Protocol  Deviation Form should be completed by [CONTACT_174384].  
Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections  
The study site also may be subject to quality assurance audit s by [CONTACT_63222]. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated auditor will contact [CONTACT_63223]. The auditor may ask to visit the facilities where laboratory samples are collected, 
where the immunotherapy m edication is stored and prepared, and any other facility used during the 
study. In addition, there is the possibility that this study may be inspected by [CONTACT_17513], 
including the FDA. If the study site is contact[CONTACT_63224] a regulato ry body, the sponsor 
should be notified immediately. The investigator and institution guarantee access for quality 
assurance auditors to all study documents as described in Section 13.1.

The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting the Federal Wide Assurance Number 
or comparable number assigned by [CONTACT_9092].  
The sponsor or designee in conjunction with the study sit e investigators will supply relevant 
documents for submission to the Hopkins IRB for the protocol’s review and approval. This 
protocol, a copy of the informed consent form, and, if applicable, subject recruitment materials 
and/or advertisements and other d ocuments required by [CONTACT_1763], must 
be submitted to the IRB for approval. The IRB’s written approval of the protocol and subject 
informed consent must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before 
commencement of th e study (ie, before shipment of the sponsor -supplied immunotherapy). The 
IRB approval must refer to the study by [CONTACT_1764], number, and version date; identify 
versions of other documents (eg,  informed consent form) reviewed; and state the approv al date. 
The sponsor will supply immunotherapy solutions once the sponsor has confirmed the adequacy of 
site regulatory documentation and the sponsor has received permission from the competent 
authorities  (Hopkins contracting office and Hopkins IRB) to be gin the trial. Until the site receives 
the study immunotherapy no protocol activities, including screening may occur.  
The study site must adhere to all requirements stipulated by [CONTACT_1201]. This may include notification 
to the IRB regarding protocol amendmen ts, updates to the informed consent form, recruitment 
materials intended for viewing by [CONTACT_1766], safety reporting requirements, reports and updates 
regarding the ongoing review of the study at intervals specified by [CONTACT_1201], and submission of the 
investig ator’s final status report to the IRB. All IRB approvals and relevant documentation for 
these items must be provided to the sponsor or its designee.  
Subject incentives should not exert undue influence for participation. Payments to subjects must 
be approve d by [CONTACT_87852].

purposes of conducting the study. The in formed consent form further explains the nature of the 
study, its objectives, and potential risks and benefits, as well as the date informed consent is given. 
The informed consent form will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he or  she 
is free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without prejudice to his or her further 
medical care.  
The investigators in conjunction with the sponsor is responsible for the preparation, content, and 
IRB approval of the informed consent f orm. The informed consent form must be approved by [CONTACT_849008].  
The informed consent form must be written in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective 
subject. It is the responsibility of the investigator to explain t he detailed elements of the informed 
consent form to the study subject. Information should be given in both oral and written form 
whenever possible and in the manner deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_849009]. In the event the 
subject is not capable of renderin g adequate written informed consent, then the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative may provide such consent for the subject in accordance with the IRB 
regulations.  
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunity to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will participate in 
the study, then the informed cons ent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], or the subject’s 
legally acceptable representative, at the time of consent and prior to the subject entering into the 
study. The subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative should be instruct ed to sign 
using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpoint ink. The investigator must 
also sign and date the informed consent form at the time of consent and prior to subject entering 
into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a d esignee of the investigator to sign to the extent 
permitted by [CONTACT_849009].

Measurement of Wheal  
Patien ts are asked to avoid scratching while skin tests are developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Gentle blowing may 
alleviate some of the discomfort. Once the 15 -minute timer rings measurements may begin using a 
clean ruler or disposable caliper with 1mm increments.  Digital image of th e skin tests will also be 
recorded using the Flare Diagnostics (Baltimore, MD) automated skin test reading device. A 
positve result is defined as an average wheal diameter greater than or equal 5mm and at least 2mm 
greater than negative control.  Readings m ust be performed in a rotation consistent with the pattern 
of placement. Careful measurements may take several minutes and therefore allergens placed last 
should subsequently be read last so that all allergens have had the same amount of time to develop.

3   The purpose of this document is to provide a description of the statistical methods and procedures to be implemented for the analysis of data derived from the study entitled: “A double-blind, prospective, parallel group evaluation of a novel biologic therapy for perennial allergic rhinitis” sponsored by [CONTACT_849012], LLC, and conducted at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland. The protocol version used for the plan is Version 6.9 dated February 10, 2017. At the time of development of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) the study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_848971] R. Tversky, MD, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD Any revisions to the SAP (both alternative and additional methods) will be made prior to database lock and reasons for such revisions will be described in the final Clinical Study Report (CSR).  STUDY OVERVIEW  Endpoints  Primary Endpoints  The primary endpoint is to quantify and compare the clinical difference in signs and symptoms and medication usage as well as the global RQLQ index that may be apparent when subjects with active perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) with or without seasonal symptoms (SAR) are treated in a double-blind, prospective, controlled eight weeks study with a proprietary mixture of FDA approved allergens (PMA) versus placebo.    Secondary Endpoint The secondary endpoints include a symptom score trend analysis, drop out rates, and adverse events profile (AE). Serum will also be stored for measurement of immunoglobulins at a later time.

4  STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Study Design This is a phase 2 proof of concept study. It is being undertaken to characterize and quantify the clinical difference in signs and symptoms that may evolve when subjects with active seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (SAR/PAR) are administered a sub-cutaneous form of immunotherapy in a double-blind, prospective, controlled six weeks study wherein a proprietary mixture of FDA approved allergens (PMA) is compared with saline placebo.  Randomization to active PMA versus placebo treatment is on a 1 to 1 ratio. A double-blind study design is used to minimize outcome bias.  Randomization measures to minimize bias at study entry include computerized random assignment of treatment versus placebo vials. Subjects who are receiving nasal steroids for their SAR/PAR at screening may continue in the screening process if they agree to discontinue their therapy and commence a 14-day wash-out period of their medication prior to receiving active/placebo immunotherapy. Potential study subjects who, at screening, are not on active treatment for their SAR/PAR and asthma may enter directly into the investigation provided they fulfil entry and exclusion criteria and screening testing requirements.   The population to be studied consists of male and female adults aged 18 years to 65 years who are actively manifesting SAR/PAR have a score of at least [ADDRESS_1180518] three decades, in some 20,000 patients by [CONTACT_848981] (see 3.2). In clinical evaluation this patented antigen mixture has provided clinical symptomatic relief to patients with SAR/PAR in as brief a period as three administrations of immunotherapy injections and has an observed overall success rate of approximately [ADDRESS_1180519]-treatment safety follow up assessment at one month following the final administration of immunotherapy. All doses of immunotherapy will be administered in the study site clinic by [CONTACT_414953].          A schematic of the study design is included in the Figure below. A schedule of assessments is listed in Error! Reference source not found. of the protocol.

5  Figure Schematic of Study Design                    The SAP will follow the study protocol sections 12.1 to 12.3. Statistical methodology was developed in conjunction with the faculty of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics. Specific calculations include the following wherein “p" values as well as 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  Primary Outcomes  1. Daily Combined Score (DCS) – Comparison of the delta visit 2 to visit 17 (change in score) between both treatment groups I and II using an unpaired t test.  2. Daily Combined Score (DCS) – Comparison of the delta visit 2 to visit 18 (change in score) between both treatment groups I and II using an unpaired t test.  3. mini-rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) - Comparison of the delta visit 2 to visit 17 (change in score) between both treatment groups I and II using an unpaired t test.  4. mini-RQLQ - Comparison of the delta visit 2 to visit 18 (change in score) between both treatment groups I and II using an unpaired t test.

6    Secondary Outcomes  1. Total nasal symptoms score (TNSS)- Comparison of the delta visit 2 to visit 17 (change in score) between both treatment groups I and II using an unpaired t test.  2. TNSS - Comparison of the delta visit 2 to visit 18 (change in score) between both treatment groups I and II using an unpaired t test.  3. Adverse Events - Adverse events (AEs) were to be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a patient. Comparison of the rates of adverse events between both treatment groups I and II will be evaluated using a one-tailed Fischer’s exact test.  Other Comparisons and Outcomes  1. Baseline characteristics - Comparison of the rates of specific characteristics between both treatment groups I and II using a one-tailed Fischer’s exact test and/or unpaired t test.  2. Use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] - Comparison of the rates of epi[INVESTIGATOR_848972] I and II using a one-tailed Fischer’s exact test.  3. Mini-RQLQ - Kaplan-Meier or similar repeated measures test will also be used to calculate the effect of treatment over time between both groups I and II.  4. Drop out - Comparison of the drop out rates between both groups I and II using a one-tailed Fischer’s exact test.  5. Trend tests - For these study data, representing a continuous response, an appropriate test, such as the Jonckheere-Terptsra trend test, based on a sum of Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests may be sensitive and reveal a mild trend where pair-wise comparisons may not be able to find significant differences and not be as helpful. Other trend tests may also be used.

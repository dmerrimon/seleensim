Abstract:  
The prevalence of postoperative dysphagia (swallowing impairment) is critically high in patient s with cardiovascular 
disease who undergo cardiac surgery (CS) with estimates ranging from 3% -94%. Notably, postoperative dysphagia in 
CS patients has been linked to morbidity and mortality. A recent research study that prospectively examined 
postoperative  dysphagia in a cohort of 182 CS patients revealed that CS patients who aspi[INVESTIGATOR_659989], intubation, death, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715], and also had a shorter 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS)/reduced health care costs. These findings indicate that an effective cough response may 
lead to improved health -related outcomes in CS patients, implying that therapeutics focused on improving cough 
peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_659990].  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_659991] (RST) is a treatment approach that has led 
to improvements in cough strength and effectiveness in a variety of patient populations with dysphagia. Given its 
effectiveness in improving pulmonary and swallow function in high -risk patients with dysp hagia, implementing RST 
preoperatively may be an effective approach to prevent postoperative impairments in airway clearance physiologic 
capacity and swallowing, thereby [CONTACT_660061] -related outcomes. Therefore, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_659992], feasibility, and impact of a preoperative RST program i n CS patients with 
reduced airway clearance physiologic capacity via three specific aims: 1) Determine the safety and feasibility of a 
preoperative RST program; 2)  Examine the impact of a preoperative RST program on expi[INVESTIGATOR_696], inspi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and 
airway clearance physiologic capacity; and 3) Investigate the impact of a preoperative RST program on swallowing 
safety and health -related outcomes in CS patients. To determi ne the safety and feasibility of RST, attendance at 
telehealth /in-person  sessions, RST adherence, and adverse outcomes will be tracked. To examine the impact of RST  
on patient outcomes , longitudinal evaluations of breathing and swallowing will be performed, and health -related 
outcomes tracked. This is the first study to explore preoperative RST in CS patients to improve swallowing safety and 
mitigate adverse health -related outcomes. Findi ngs will provide preliminary data to support clinical utility of 
preoperative RST in high -risk CS patients and will support further research in a larger cohort of CS patients to 
elucidate the efficacy of RST and to determine the optimal training regimen an d patients who would benefit from 
RST.  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS:  
We seek to examine the safety, feasibility , and clinical utility of a preoperative respi[INVESTIGATOR_659993] (RST)  
program in cardiac surgical ( CS) patients with the following specific aims:  
Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that a preoperative RST program will be safe and feasible in CS patients. Approach: CS 
patients will complete at-home  RST with weekly telehealth sessions  and one in -person session at mid -point . 
Attendance, RST adherence, and adverse events will be tracked.  
Aim2: Test the hypothesis that a preoperative RST program will improve respi[INVESTIGATOR_659994]. Approach: Forced vital capacity, m aximum expi[INVESTIGATOR_659995], 
volun tary cough peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], and cough spi[INVESTIGATOR_659996]. Functional measures of dyspnea and speech rate/pausing during speech will also be tracked (London Chest Activity 
of Daily Living scale [LCADL],  Bamboo passage) . Descriptive statistics and a repeated measures analysis will evaluate 
potential change in physiologic metrics of interest.  
Safety, Feasibility, and Impact of Preoperative Respi[INVESTIGATOR_659997] l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022  
 2 Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that a preoperative RST program will improve postoperative respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], swallowing and 
health -related  outcomes. Approach: Following surgery,  a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing will be 
performed  and h ealth -related  outcomes examined.  
Outcomes will provide needed ‘proof of concept’ feasibility and safety data and deliver preliminary insights into the 
potential role of a proactive , targeted , and mechanistically guided  ‘prehabilitation’ for CS patients to improve airway 
clearance capacity  and health -related  outcomes. If hypotheses are confirmed, these data will support future large -
scale clinical trials.  
 
SIGNIFICANCE : 
A reported 30.3 million Americans, or 12.1% of the populat ion, are living with cardiovascular disease (CVD),[ADDRESS_889878] of ~$219 billion.2 According to the American Heart Associat ion, more than 1 million adults 
undergo cardiac surgical (CS) procedures in the [LOCATION_002] annually , with this number expected to increase over the 
next decade.3 Unfortunately, swallowing difficulty (dysphagia) is  a common postoperative complication of CS that is 
associated with poor patient outcomes.4–[ADDRESS_889879] prospective study utilizing instrumental 
imaging techniques and validated swallowing outcomes in CS patients.9 In the 182 CS patients examined with fiberoptic 
endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), unsafe swallowi ng was confirmed in 94% of patients (66% penetration, 
29% aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) and inefficient swallowing (pharyngeal residue) in 52%  (Fig. 1)  following extubation.9 Of significance 
was our findings that postoperative aspi[INVESTIGATOR_659998] 85 -hour delay to resume oral intake, a 43% 
increased length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], ~$50,[ADDRESS_889880] of care, pneu monia (OR:2.6), reintubation (OR: 5.7), and 
death (OR: 2.8).[ADDRESS_889881] (Table 
1).9  Thus, a CS patient’s  physiologic capacity to produce a strong and effec tive cough was a significant prognostic 
factor  in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_659999]. Given that cough strength represents a modifiable physiologic variable , this finding 
was of high clinical significance, revealing a potential treatment target to improve CS patient o utcomes  that motivate 
this proposal.  Fig. 1: Prevalence, risk factors and outcomes of dysphagia in 182 CS postoperative

reported 85% of individuals with ALS develop dysphagia, dystussia (cough 
impairment) , and dyspnea during the disease progression,23–26 we proposed that 
proactive , targeted exercises of the upper aerodigestive trac t during the early  stages 
of the disease and prior  to the development of significant impairment would 
increase physiologic reserve to improve and/or maintain airway clearance 
physiologic capacity into inevitable disease progression. This work has noted tha t

 5 Recruitment:  [CONTACT_549013] is a faculty member of the Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, and 
therefore has close ties with this patient population and clinical setting. Further, the ARC Lab has a strong history of 
successful collaborations with t he cardiothoracic surgeons at the UF Heart and Vascular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (Drs. Jeng, Martin, 
Beaver, Arnaoutakis ) who see patients in this preoperative clinic.  Participants will be recruited from the preoperative 
clinic visit. Drs. Jeng and Donohue will identify e ligible participants who meet inclusion criteria from clinic schedules 
and will approach identified individuals who will be informed of their potential eligibility to participate  and asked if 
they would like to learn about this study. If they express inter est, an approved study team member listed on this 
protocol will verbally detail the aims of the study, specific requirements for inclusion , and answer any questions from 
patients and caregivers. They will also be provided with a copy of the informed consen t form  to read over. Those who 
wish to be enrolled will sign an informed consent form,  will be provided a copy of the signed informed consent form, 
assigned a subject identifier, and an appointment will be scheduled for their Research Evaluation 1.  
 
Research Evaluations:  CS patients will undergo three separate research examinations during this study. Before 
commencing the RST program, an initial research examination (pulmonary function testing , functional speech/dyspnea 
measures ) will be completed. Af ter completing RST and before undergoing surgery, a second research examination 
(pulmonary function testing, FEES , functional speech/dyspnea measures ) will be completed. Finally, postoperatively, a 
third research examination (FEES) will be completed. The m ethods for the research examinations are outlined in detail 
below . 
 
Research Evaluation 1: As previously described, CS patients will undergo evaluations during the preoperative phase 
immediately before and after the RST program. Research evaluations will take approximately 30-45 minutes to 
complete. During these evaluations, the following procedures and outcomes will be collected:  
 
Pulmonary function testing (PFT):  Consistent with PFT protocols and the American Thoracic Society gu idelines, all PFT 
measures will be completed in an upright seated position with a nose clip.29,30 FVC will be measured with a handheld 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (Micro I; Carefusion,Yorba Linda, [LOCATION_004]).  For FVC, CS patients will be instructed to take a deep breath 
in, place their mouth around the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], and blow all t he air our from their lungs.  MEP and MIP will be measured 
with the MicroRPM  handheld MEP device (Micro Direct Inc., Lewiston, ME). For MEP testing, CS patients will be 
instructed to place their mouth around the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_660007]. For MIP testing, CS 
patients will be instructed to place their mouths  around the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_660008]. The 
participant will perform  up to  three trials of each task, inter -spaced with a one -minute rest in between. The highest 
value will be used for statistical analysis.  Voluntary cough PEF will  be tested using a handheld analog Mini -Wright Peak 
Cough Flow Meter (model number 3103085,  Clement Clarke Int., Harlow, [LOCATION_008]). This device is considered 
the gold standard Peak Cough Flow (PCF) device and is one of the only PCF devices that conta ins a one -way expi[INVESTIGATOR_660009] a participant to breathe air in from the device to reduce contamination. Additionally, we will fit the 
PCF meter with a Mini -Wright disposable single -use bacterial expi[INVESTIGATOR_660010] -way valve filter mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (mod el 
number 3122064) that traps any expectorated matter or organisms ensuring a barrier to the PCF meter device. This 
method conforms to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards for PCF testing. Participants will be instructed to 
“cough hard like someth ing is stuck in your throat.” The participant will perform three trials inter -spaced with a one -
minute rest in between. The outcome will be Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_1901]  ((PEF) L/min). The highest obtained value will be 
used.  For cough spi[INVESTIGATOR_68333], an oral p neumotachograph (MLT 1000; ADInstruments, Inc., Colorado Springs, 
Colorado) will be connected to a spi[INVESTIGATOR_660011] (MQ 304 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_660012]; Vacumed; Ventura, 
[LOCATION_004]). Participants will be instructed to wrap their lips around the mouthpie ce and “cough hard like something is 
stuck in your throat.” Cough waveforms will be recorded using LabChart Version 7 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, 
Washington) and a laptop computer devoted to this study. Cough spi[INVESTIGATOR_660013] e 
duration, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_660014], compression phase duration, expi[INVESTIGATOR_660015], peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_216965], and

Functional Dyspnea Measure: Research participants will complete the London Chest Activity of Daily Living scale 
(LCADL), which is a standardized and validated 15 -item questionnaire that measures dyspnea during activities of daily 
living.32 
 
Speec h Measure:  The ‘Bamboo Passage’ is a validated speech testing item that consists of a 98-word  paragraph.33 It is 
used  to determine speaking rate, and number and duration of pauses during speech. Participant s will be instructed  to 
read the passage in their normal speaking rate and loudness. Speaking rate (words per minute), number of pauses, and 
duration of pauses will be calculated.   
 A digital audio recorder (TASCAM, DR40) connected to a condenser headset microph one (AKG, Inc., HSC271) with a 
lapel windscreen (eBoot, Inc.) will be placed on the participants head with the headset microphone at a standardized 
distance of 10cm from the right lip corner. Audio recordings will be digitized at 44.[ADDRESS_889896]. Speech testing items will be recorded and saved 
for subsequent offline analysis. Audio recordings obtained during speech testing will be blinded and rated in Audacity 
(Audacity 2.2.2, WordPress, 2018) for the below speech outcomes.   
 
Aim 2 Outcomes : Given our desire to index physiologic capacity, we will utilize the highest obtained outcome for FVC, 
MEP, MIP, cough PEF, and cough spi[INVESTIGATOR_660025]. 
LCADL ratings and speech measurements will also be compared before and after RST. We hypothesize that CS patients 
will improve FVC, MEP, MIP, cough PEF, cough spi[INVESTIGATOR_559350] , dyspnea, and speaking rate/pauses  post -RST.  
 
RST Program and Telehealth /In-Person  Visits : 
RST Program:  Enrolled CS patients will undergo a preoperative RST program 
immediately following Research Evaluation 1 (preoperative, pre-RST)  with a 
targeted duration of [ADDRESS_889897] will be completed from the 
patients’ home with portable expi[INVESTIGATOR_660026] p reviously used: the EMST -150 or the EMST75 Lite  and the IA -150 devices 
(Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_32720], Gainesville, [LOCATION_012], Fig. 4). The EMST [ADDRESS_889898] a resistance range 
of 30 to 150cm H 20 and represent spring -loaded  pressure threshold devices (Fig . 
4). For completion of exercises, each device will be set to a patient’s individualized 
70% MEP or MIP. Following the baseline evaluation, trainers will be calibrated to 
the appropriate setting , and the patient will be trained on how to perform 
exercises. Additionally, they will be provided with a training manual that includes 
detailed instructions and photographs to provide reinforcement of the initial 
training session.

Safety, Feasibility, and Impact of Preoperative Respi[INVESTIGATOR_659997] l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022  
 7 Participants will need t o demonstrate proficiency in performing both the expi[INVESTIGATOR_32718] (EMST) 
and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_32718] (IMST) exercise prior to leaving the clinic and will be given a training log to 
record their daily sessions and a telehealt h appointment card with weekly meeting dates and instructions for how to 
access the secure telehealth portal (a secure version of Zoom).  
The RST protocol will be the previously utilized “Rule of 5’s” 13 that includes training 5 days per week and performing 5 
sets of 5 reps (i.e., 25 repetitions) for both expi[INVESTIGATOR_660029]. Thus, a total of 50 
repetitions ([ADDRESS_889899]) will be performed by [CONTACT_193134]. CS p atients will be instructed to breathe in 
(IMST) or out (EMST) for several seconds until the valve audibly releases. Between repetitions, CS patients will be 
instructed to rest [ADDRESS_889900] for one 
minute before completing the next set. Repetitions will be recorded in a training log provided to the CS patients to 
track adherence and the quality of repetitions will be monitored during weekly telehealth sessions.  
Tele health Sessions:  CS patients will complete one -five training session s per week via telehealth with a research 
speech -language pathologist  to ensure pa tients are using correct form and technique, to complete a safety and adverse 
event check, to answer any questions patients may have, and to assist with adherence issues.  The number of telehealth 
visits per week will be determined based on individual patie nt factors including 1) patient performance of the RST 
program, and 2) patient requests for additional training/clarification.  The research speech -language pathologist may 
recommend up to 5 telehealth visits per week and/or patients may request additional telehealth sessions (up to 5 per 
week) if they have questions or require additional support to perform the RST exercises corre ctly. EMST/IMST devices 
will also be recalibrated weekly using the Borg Category Ratio [ADDRESS_889901] exercise  
equal to 70% MEP/MIP  (Borg scale  score  of 7/10) . The Borg Category Ratio Scale has been used in the limb literat ure 
and demonstrated accuracy in measuring %repetition max (RM). For example , a score of 2 is approximately 20% of a 
RM and a score of 7 is approximately 70% of a RM.[ADDRESS_889902] in a 
private room using a UF secure telehealth platform (a secure version of Zoom). Attendance for weekly telehealth 
sessions will be tracked.  
In-Person  Visit:  CS patients will also have one in -person visit  within participants’ homes or the research laboratory (DG -
136)  with a study team member  at the mid -point of the RST program to ensure patients are using correct form and 
technique, to complete a safety and adverse event check, to a nswer any questions patients may have, and to assist 
with adherence issues. EMST/IMST devices will also be recalibrated by [CONTACT_660066] 70%.  LCADL ratings and functional speech measures (bamboo passage) will also be obta ined.  
Training Logs:  CS patients will fill out daily training logs to track RST repetitions (adherence) and to note any adverse 
events related to RST. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_660030].   
 
Aim [ADDRESS_889903], attendance at telehealth /in-person treatment  sessions, and 
adverse events associated with RST. We hypothesize that RST will be safe, well -tolerated, and feasible in CS patients as 
measured by [CONTACT_660067], attendance at all telehealth /in-person  sessions, and no reported adverse events.  
 
Research Evaluation 2: 
After completing  the RST program  and prior to surgery , CS patients will undergo PFT s, read the bamboo passage, and 
complete the LCADL as they did during Research Evaluation 1. Additionally , they  will undergo a standardized 
Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES).  The second research evaluation will take approximately 45 
minutes to complete.  
 
Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES):  CS patients will undergo a FEES exam in a dedicated room (UB 
1707, UB 1739) in the preoperative clinic or the ARC lab before and after the RST program using an Olympus flexible 
video HD Rhino Laryngoscope (ENF -V3) connected  to a portable video processor and light source (Olympus CV170). To 
ensure patient comfort, a water -soluble lubricant (Aplicare sterile lubricating jelly 82 -280) and, per participant 
preference, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_660031] -agent (i.e., lidocaine hydrochloride jelly USP, 2%) will be applied to the naris, and the 
laryngoscope will be passed trans -nasally through the nasopharynx and hypopharynx until an optimal position is 
obtained.[ADDRESS_889904] of Preoperative Respi[INVESTIGATOR_659997] l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022  
 8 During laryngoscope advancement, the participant may be asked to hum or say “eeeeee” to help visualize anatomy 
and placement o f the laryngoscope. A standardized FEES protocol will be used that includes a combination of voicing 
and swallowing tasks. Once optimal scope positioning is confirmed, the participant will be asked to perform a series of 
voicing tasks to allow assessment o f laryngeal and vocal fold movement that include: 1) sustained vowel “ah” 2) 
vowel/sniff alternating task; 3) cheek puff task; 4) breath hold task; and 5) a pi[INVESTIGATOR_660032] “e”. CS patients 
will be given 5ml Gatorade x2, 10ml Gatorade x2, comforta ble cup sip x2, teaspoon pudding x2, cracker x2, and M&Ms 
x3. A liquid that is colored needs to be used so that it may be visualized during swallowing. Gatorade will be the typi[INVESTIGATOR_660033] a participant has dietary restrictions or a dislike for Gator ade other options will include grape juice or milk. 
To ensure patient safety, swallowing trials will be discontinued after two epi[INVESTIGATOR_660034] a patient is 
unable to clear >70% of the bolus. At the completion of the swallowing trials, th e laryngoscope will be carefully 
removed.  
 
Recordings will be saved on a USB200 recording device with an encrypted hard drive. The FEES images will be labeled 
with the participant identification study number and immediately transferred onto the Aerodigesti ve Research Core 
laboratory server to ensure data is not lost. This is a secure server and only individuals within the lab included on this 
IRB will have access to saved and coded files. The video images will remain on the encrypted hard drive until the en d 
of the study and then they will be deleted. The transferred recordings will be kept on our secure server for five years 
following the completion of the study. Additionally, if abnormalities are noted that would be pertinent to the 
participant’s medical c are (for example, vocal fold paralysis or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]), our study team will alert the medical team 
(attending physician or nurse caring for the participant) that an abnormality was detected.  
 
Swallowing Ratings:

Post operative  Research Evaluation 3:  
Following completion of the RST program and after cardiac surgery, patients will undergo a standardized FEES 
evaluation  that will take approximately 30 minutes  and health -related outcome measures will be tracked.  For 
postoperative FEES examinations, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_660039] a cognitive screen 
(Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale score of 0)39 and by [CONTACT_660069]’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_660040] (Sp02

readiness for participating in a postoperative FEES.   
 
Following confirmation that the participant is appropriate to proceed to swallowing testing, the research SLP will the 
same standardized FEES protocol as described in the preoperative research exams and will be performed at the 
participant’s bedside.  Postoperative FEES examinations will be performed within 72 hours of extubation with CS 
patients sitting upright in bed.  During this period, the participant’s vital signs will be monitored and although not

Swallowing measures : Two blinded judges will independently rate swallowing safety  and efficiency  using the validated 
penetration -aspi[INVESTIGATOR_127390] (PAS), dynamic imaging grade of swallowing toxicity (DIGEST), the New Zealand secretion 
scale (NZSS), and the Yale pharyngeal residue severity rating scale (YRS) .36–38,40,41 These scales are described in detail 
above in Tables 4 -7. 
 
Health -related outcomes:  We will collect information on enrolled participants’ medical history via the University of 
[LOCATION_012] Heart and Vascular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_108551] (Epic, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI). Variables 
of interest may include previous  history of d ysphagia (y/n), previous cardiothoracic surgery (y/n), type of previous 
cardiothoracic surgery, previous cardiothoracic surgery notes, year of previous cardiothoracic surgery, dysphagia 
following previous cardiothoracic surgery (y/n), instrumental swallow evaluations after previous surgeries (y/n), 
primary surgery diagnosis , etc. Following surgery, enrolled participants will be closely monitored , and the following 
variables of interest will be tracked: time to oral diet, length of ICU and total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], intubation duration, 
extubation fast track status (y/n), pneumonia status, reintubation status, 30 -day readmission status, and 90 -day 
mortality status Epic . Given the nature of our therapy, a dditional metrics that provide insight into CS patients’ 
pulmo nary or swallow function may be extracted from respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175]’ , speech -language pathologists, or other 
health care provider notes. These metrics may include things such as DLCO, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], intubation duration, 
negative inspi[INVESTIGATOR_105864], instrumental swallow evaluation imaging (e.g., videofluoroscopy, FEES), etc. In addition to 
obtaining medical information from patients’ charts, t est results  from research evaluations  can be made available upon 
request to aid in medical care and reduce ris k of repetitive testing.   
 
Aim [ADDRESS_889908] that they will demonstrate an adequate cough response to remove tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (PAS of 6). Further, we 
predict to observe low rates of pneumonia, reintubation, 30 -day readmission, and 90 -day mortality , as well a s 
decreased time to oral intake and LOS for enrolled participants during their recovery.  
 
Sample size justification: Given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_660042] a large -scale clinical trial is wa rranted, a justification based on statistical power to test hypotheses strictly at 
the α=0.[ADDRESS_889909] in a larger cohort of CS 
patients.  
 
Statistical analyses:  Descriptive statistics, magnitudes of estimates, and spaghetti and needle plots that visualize 
individual -level data across time points will first be utilized t o summarize data in this small cohort and prior to 
performing conventional analyses and hypothesis testing.  
Aim 1:  Attendance, RST adherence, and adverse events will be summarized descriptively with frequency counts and 
percentages.  
Safety, Feasibility, and Impact of Preoperative Respi[INVESTIGATOR_659997] l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022  
 11 Aim 2 : Descriptive statistics and an appropriate repeated measures analysis based on the distribution of data will be 
used to evaluate potential change in FVC, MEP, MIP, voluntary cough peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], and cough spi[INVESTIGATOR_660043] , speech rate , number of p auses, duration of pauses, LCADL ratings  across time points (pre -RST vs. post -RST).  
Aim 3: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize swallowing safety profiles postoperatively (frequency 
histogram, mean, mode, range of PAS , DIGEST, NZSS, YRS  scores) , and logistic regression will be used to compare 
swallowing safety  and efficiency  across timepoints.[ADDRESS_889910] track status, any related respi[INVESTIGATOR_660044], 30-day readmission, mortality, and 
time to oral intake/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95156] , etc.  will be summarized descriptively (frequency counts, %) and compared to our 
historical data set in CS patients.  
 
Data Management  and Quality Control : Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) will be used to enter and store 
data for the current study, which is a secure web -based application  hosted at the University of [LOCATION_012] . REDCap has a 
variety of features that streamline data entry and processing including the ability to download and export data directly 
to commonly used statistical analyses software. The ARC lab has successfully used REDCap for data collection, storage, 
and analyses for other research studies

Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP):  [CONTACT_660071]  will provide medical oversight for this study and we will utilize standard 
IRB oversight to monitor any adverse events or protocol deviations.  The UF -IRB will review the human subject protocol 
and will monitor the quality of research occurring under the approved protocol during annual continuing reviews. The 
IRB must approve the protocol annually, as the study progresses. Data safety monitoring will occur during weekly 
meetings to review Adverse Events (AE) and Protocol Deviation Logs with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_137852] y team.  In the event of an 
unanticipated adverse response, the participant’s physician will be immediately notified, and the participant will be 
seen for a complete evaluation. Data, adverse events, and individual subject safety are monitored throughout ea ch 
subject’s evaluation as well as during weekly laboratory meetings with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_660046]’s and protocol deviations.  
 
Potential Risks : All participants will be required to pass a COVID -[ADDRESS_889912]  (i.e., COVID -19 negative) that is performed as 
standard of care in all surgical patients prior to being allowed to participate in this study. Thus, the risk for personal 
working on this project, in addition to potential cross contamination of equipment wi ll not be a factor.  
The following risks will be disclosed to all participants prior to obtaining their consent to participate:  
a) A Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) can result in in discomfort, gagging or vomiting. 
Although extremely rare other complications that have been reported can include vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (0.06% 
Safety, Feasibility, and Impact of Preoperative Respi[INVESTIGATOR_659997] l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022  
 12 reported incidence), laryngospasms (0.03% rep orted incidence), or epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (0.3% reported incidence). The 
reported incidences of these adverse reactions to FEES are based on published reports in 6,000 patients.35 
b) Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (material in trachea) is always a possible risk during the FEES  exam, as the test is intended to detect 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_660047].  
c)  There are no documented complications of voluntary cough spi[INVESTIGATOR_660048] . 
d) While RST has been safe and well -tolerated in a variety of patient populations,13,14,16 –18,20,21 there is a chance it 
could result in d izziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, or shortness of breath.  
 
Potential Benefits:  Subjects may potentially benefit from participation through improved breathing, cough, and/or 
swallowing function. Participating in this study will  also include an instrumenta l swallowing evaluation following 
surgery and may lead to the early identification of any swallowing impairments to minimize adverse effects of 
swallowing difficulty and to initiate preventative measures for risk of choking, respi[INVESTIGATOR_660049]/or p neumonia 
post -operatively. Additionally, study participation may lead to sooner oral intake of food, liquids , and medications while 
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of comprehensive swallowing testing being performed post -extubation.  
 
Conflict of Interest:  There is no conflict of interest to disclose for any study team member that is specifically relevant 
to this study.  
 
Summary and Conclusions: This pi[INVESTIGATOR_660050], safety, and physiologic 
impact of a targeted  preoperative RST program in a small group of high -risk CS patients to prevent postoperative 
dysphagia and associated adverse outcomes. By [CONTACT_660070] -related  
outcomes in a feasible design for this grant me chanism, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_660051] K99 -R00 NIH

population where there is no current standard of care or evide nce guided intervention guidelines for either pre or 
postoperative dysphagia management.11,[ADDRESS_889913] of Preoperative Respi[INVESTIGATOR_659997] l_Version 2.0._4.10 .2022

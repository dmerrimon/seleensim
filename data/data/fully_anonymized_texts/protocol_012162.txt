 [ADDRESS_687363] NARRATIVE  
 41 
1) Background  [ADDRESS_687364] deployed  on potentially dangerous 43 
missions in support of the wars in  Iraq and Afghanistan [1].  Combat duty is inherently hazardous and [ADDRESS_687365] experienced intense and personally life -threatening situations or witnessed 45 
horrific and traumatic events .  The neuroendocrine stress response that is associated with these types of 46 
potentially life -threatening experiences prepares the brain and body for survival.  As part of this survival 47 
response, several brain systems become hyper -responsive and sensitized to potential threat.  In particular, 48 
exaggerated  amygdala responses during stre ssful experiences enhance the  encoding of vivid and indelible 49 
emotional memories [2, 3].  For some  combat veterans, the intensity and horrific nature of these [ADDRESS_687366]-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  54 
Initial rates of PTSD in Soldiers returning from combat duty in Iraq and Afghanistan were reported to be 55 
as high as 17% [4], and subsequent reports have confirmed rates as high as 20% [5], depending on the 56 
method of assessment.  Furthermore, PTSD often presents as a comorbid disorder with a range of other 57

psychiatric and/or somatic problems [6-8].  Treatment for PTSD usually involves  some combination of 58 
cognitive therapy, exposure therapy, and pharmacotherapy.  Unfortunately, current therapeutic 59 
interventions show variable efficacy and frequent treatment failures [9, 10].  Consequently, alternative 60 
approaches or augmen tations to existing treatments are needed.   61 
 62 
Sleep disruption in PTSD  63 
Sleep disruption has been labeled the “hallmark of PTSD .”  In fact, sleep problems appear to be the most 64 
prevalent complaint of individuals with PTSD  [11], and may contribute significantly to the persistence 65 
and s everity of the disorder [12-14].  A recent meta -analysis confirmed the presence of sleep [ADDRESS_687368] sleep, and 67 
elevated rapid -eye-movement density, when compared to unaffected individuals [15].  Over two -thirds of 68 
combat veterans with PTSD endorse problems with sleep, p articularly insomnia and nightmares [13, 16, 69 
17], with rates of self-reported sleep c omplaints exceeding 90% in some studies [18].  Neylan and 70 
collea gues (1998) found that initial insomnia (difficulty falling asleep) occurred in 44% of combat 71 
veterans with PTSD, 6% of veterans without PTSD and 5% of healthy comparison subjects.  Moreover, 72 
91% of veterans with PTSD reported difficulties maintaining slee p (i.e., staying asleep after initial sleep 73 
onset)  [19].  In another stu dy, early morning awakening  was reported by 43% of individuals with PTSD 74 
compared to 13% of individuals without PTSD [20].  Nightmares leading to awakening  have been 75 
reported to occur frequently in about 50% of comba t veterans with PTSD, compared to only 5% of 76 
veterans without PTSD and 3% of healthy controls [19].  Moreover, the severity of sleep disturbance 77 
correlates with overall PTSD symptom severity [21, 22], even when accounting for the effects of 78 
potentially confounding variables such as alcohol use and psychiatric comorbidity [23].  Recent findings [ADDRESS_687369] that insomnia and sleep problems may actually play a mediating role between combat stressors 80 
and the eventual development of psychological symptoms among veterans of the war in Iraq [24].  [ADDRESS_687370] -deployment [25], and sleep 83 
problems are better predictors of suicide among military personnel than measures of either depression or 84 
hopelessness [26].  Thus, sleep may be a leverage point for affecting recovery from PTSD.  85 
Research on conditioned fear point s to a critical role for sleep in the treatment of PTSD.  Indeed, 86 
PTSD has been conceptualized as a disorder of fear conditioning, involving hyper -responsive fear 87 
reactions via sustained and exaggerated amygdala activation [27].  There is a large animal liter ature 88 
showing that quality sleep facilitates the extinction of conditioned fear [28-31].  Moreover, Pace -Schott [ADDRESS_687371] in humans [32], showing  that after a person has [ADDRESS_687372] that 93 
extinction of conditioned fear is facilitated by [CONTACT_55628].  Other research shows that sleep disruption amplifies 94 
the effects of an xiety on anticipatory brain functioning in the amygdala [33].  By [CONTACT_66250], the potential 95 
for rapid recovery from PTSD may be hampered by [CONTACT_529143].  In 96 
other words, the PTSD patient may be locked in a vicious c ircle whereby [CONTACT_529144] 97 
the disorder may itself be preventing full recovery and leading to continuation or even exacerbation of 98 
symptoms.  Therefore, effective tr eatment and recovery from PTSD may be crucially dependent upon, or 99

Light Therapy for Sleep Disruption & Implications for PTSD  [ADDRESS_687374] negative or even dangerous side effects [34].  Therefore, alternative, non - 105 
pharmacologic approaches are needed.  While psychological or behavioral treatments may be helpful, 106 
many service  members perceive stigma associated with traditional talk -therapy approaches.  An 107 
alternative  non-pharmacologic approach that shows promise for treating sleep disruption is bright light 108 
therapy (BLT), particularly within the short -wave length (i.e., blue) spectrum [35-40].  Exposure to bright 109 
light at certain times of the day has been shown to r eset the timing of the sleep and wake cycle  [41], 110 
enhance subjective and objective measures of alertness  [42, 43], increase prefrontal brain activation  [44], 111 
and to improve overall sleep quality  [43].  The effectiveness of BLT is potentially  mediated by [CONTACT_941] 112 
entrainment of circadian cycles that regulate sleep and other homeostatic bodily functions [45-48].  Light 113 
exposure during the early morning phase -advances the timing of the circadian clock, while exposure 114 
during the late evening delays it  [49].   115 
Sleep -wake cycles and other endogenous circadian rhythms are regulated  predominantly by [CONTACT_941] 116 
suprachiasmatic nucle us (SCN) of the hypothalamus.  The SCN generates an endogenous rhythm of 117 
slightly over 24  hours [50].  This rhythm is entrained or synchronized by [CONTACT_529145] l cues, most 118 
prominently by [CONTACT_529146].  This process is 119 
mediated by [CONTACT_529147]  (i.e., melanopsin receptors) , which appear to be 120 
specialized for  relay ing light/dark information, particularly within the blue wavelengths, to the SCN via 121 
the optic nerve [51].  This information is then sent from the SCN to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_263575], resulting in th e 122 
synthesis and release of the hormone melatonin  which signals the biological night and prepares the 123 
organism to sleep  [40, 52, 53].   124 
Initial  studies on circadian effects of light showed that bright white light effectively suppresses 125 
melatonin and shifts both melatonin secretion and circadian rhythms [40, 54-56], resulting in shifts in 126 
sleep and wakefulness periods [57, 58].  More recently, it has been found that shorter wavelength light in 127 
the blue spectrum (446 -477nm) is particularly effective at suppressing melatonin  [59], and outperforms 128 
longer wavelength red light in terms of melatonin -suppression, circadian phase shifting, antidepressant 129 
effects, and increasing alertness [38, 39, 60-65].  Given that the melanopsin receptors appear to be 130 
primarily responsive to blue wavelength light [40], and that similar melatonin suppressing effects can be [ADDRESS_687375] now 132 
begun to focus on using this wavelength for improving daytime alertnes s, subjective sleep quality [43], 133 
and phase advancing individuals with delayed sleep phase disorders [39, 48]. BLT is particularly effective 134 
for circadian rhythm sleep disorders [66-68], which involve a shift between the individual’s sleep pattern 135 
and the pattern desired by [CONTACT_230374] [69].  BLT also appears to improve the irregular sleep -wake 136 
patterns seen in Alzheimers’ dementia, which involve periodic sleep disruption and nightly restlessness 137 
[69].  138 
Bright light therapy has long been recognized as an extremely effective treatment for Se asonal 139 
Affective Disorder (SAD) [70].  Evidence for the efficacy BLT in SAD has accumulated over nearly three [ADDRESS_687376] 141

shown that either morning or evening BLT is superior to pl acebo, while others find greater evidence of 142 
morning light superiority [41].  More recently, BLT has also shown efficacy in nonseasonal Major 143 
Depression, producing net reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms in the range o f 12-35% 144 
compared with dim light placebo conditions [71-73], and having potent synergistic effects when u sed as [ADDRESS_687378] [74], and has recently been 146 
shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and depression in patients with seizure disorders [75].  In 147 
several studies, significant effects on mood were found within 1 week or less of BLT treatment initiation 148 
[73], with increasing benefits seen over several weeks.  Recent evidence also suggests blue light 149 
wavelengths may be particularly effective for reducing depressive symptoms and features [61, 76, 77].  150 
Importantly, the effectiveness  of BLT in SAD and nonseasonal depression appears comparable to that of 151 
antidepressant medication [78], with the additional advantages of a low side effect profile [79] and 152 
quicker onset of action [73, 80].  Moreover, BLT provides a viable option for patients who resist, refuse, [ADDRESS_687379] examined the effects 158 
of BLT on PTSD outcome.  One unpublished pi[INVESTIGATOR_529124] 159 
South Carolina and Dorn VA Medical Center using [ZIP_CODE] Lux BLT (broad 160 
spectrum white light) for 45 minutes  per day for two weeks in 9 PTSD patients.  161 
Compared with placebo, BLT was associated with greater percent improvement 162 
in scores on the Clinical Global Impression Scale and the Clinician 163 
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS -5), with more  than 20% improvement foun d 164 
for BLT, while less than 4% of placebo participants showed improvement 165 
(Youngstedt, Ginsberg, Kline, & Zielinski, unpublished data).  These pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] [ADDRESS_687380] that BLT may be an effective treatment for PTSD, though larger 167 
controlled studies are needed  to provide confirmation and to examine the effects 168 
of BLT on particular PTSD symptoms.  Based on the evidence  summarized above, we propose that BLT 169 
in the blue wavelength spectrum will lead to  significantly  improved sleep, less depression, and less 170 
anxiet y among  combat veterans and other individuals with PTSD, and that these improvements will lead 171 
to a global improvement in overall PTSD severity relative to control groups with and without combat 172 
exposure.  Based on recent evidence suggesting that the effec t of light therapy on melatonin, sleep, and 173 
mood is mediated primarily via short wavelength blue light melanopsin receptors in the eye, we propose 174 
to compare  an active treatment  device with wavelengths peaking at 469 nm (blue) versus an identical 175 
placebo d evice fitted with amber colored diodes (see Figure 1) .  Thus, this study will be the first, large 176 
placebo controlled study examining the effectiveness and neuroimaging correlates of BLT in PTSD.   177

 [ADDRESS_687382] Task (MAT), 182 
our lab reported that combat exposed veterans with 183 
PTSD showed exaggerated amygdala responses to 184 
fear-related facial stimuli perceived below the 185 
threshold of conscious awareness when compared to 186 
combat exposed veterans without PTSD [27].  We [ADDRESS_687383] yet exa mined the role of 201 
sleep in this process.  However, recent data from Yoo and 202 
colleagues suggests that loss of normal sleep is associated with 203 
reduced functional connectivity between the VMPFC and the 204 
amygdala, suggesting that sleep loss may reduce the abili ty of the 205 
prefrontal cortex to regulate the emotional responses of the 206 
amygdala [81].  We have also conducted an fMRI study showing that reduced sleep is associated with 207 
altered func tional connectivity between the VMPFC and amygdala, and the strength of such connectivity 208 
is directly related to the severity of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and reduced emotional functioning  209 
[82].  Our preliminary studi es of cognitive functioning during sleep deprivation support the prefrontal - 210 
emotional dysregulation model [83-92]. Notably, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus 211 
demonstrate abnormalities in neurometabolites such as n -acetylaspartate (NAA), a putative marker of 212 
neuronal integrity, in patients with PTSD (Karl and Werner, 2010). [83-92] Because sleep disruption is [ADDRESS_687384] of hyperarous al, decreased sleep, and emotional dysregulation.   216

function, alterations in proton metabolites in the limbic system and medial prefrontal cortex, and reduced 360 
PTSD symptom severity at follow -up assessment.   The following are the Specific Aims and Hypotheses:  361 
AIM  1:  Evidence suggests that morning bright light therapy suppresses daytime melatonin and [ADDRESS_687417] in PTSD patients.  364 
Hypothesis 1 :  Six weeks of BL T will improve sleep  relative to PL among PTSD  subjects.  365 
1a:  Six weeks  of morning blue light therapy (BL T) will improve objective and subjective 366 
measures of sleep duration and quality as measured by [CONTACT_55629], sleep logs, sleep scales, and 367 
polysomnography  relative to an amber light placebo therapy (PL) condition.  368 
AIM  2:  If light therapy is successful in entraining the circadian rhythm and improving nighttime 369 
sleep in patients with PTSD, this should be associated with improvement in symptoms and cognitive 370 
functioning, as sleep has been shown to be critical in the process of extinguishing conditioned fears.  371 
Therefore, the second Aim  is to evaluate the association between changes in sleep patterns and 372 
improvement in symptom expression, emotional wellbeing, and cognitive functioning in patients with 373 
PTSD.  However, even if Aim 1  is not successful, the present study will provide important cross -sectional 374 
data regarding the relations hip between measured sleep, cognitive functioning, and fear extinction in 375 
individuals with P TSD.  376 
Hypothesis 2 :  BL will improve cognitive functioning , symptoms of PTSD , and generalization of [ADDRESS_687418].  378 
2a:  Six weeks of BL will improve measures of neurocognitive (i.e., memory and executive 379 
functions) and mood functioning relative to PL.  380 
2b: The PTSD  group receiving six weeks of BL wi ll show significant reduction in self - [ADDRESS_687419]. 384 
AIM  3:  At present, there are no known studies that have examined the neurobiological correlates [ADDRESS_687420] -treatment.  Even if Aim 1 is not supported, the 388 
obtained cross sectional data will provide critical insights regarding the association between sleep , 389 
neurometabolit es, and brain function within patients with PTSD.  This correlational information is 390 
currently lacking for PTSD and will fill an important knowledge gap regardless of whether the light 391 
therapy is su ccessful.  392 
Hypothesis 3 :  Six weeks of BL will produce reli able changes in brain activation  and [ADDRESS_687421], particularly for PTSD subjects.  394 
3a:  Relative to PL, six weeks  of BL will lead to significantly increased ventromedial [ADDRESS_687422] fMRI task.  396 
3b:  Relative to PL, six weeks  of BL will lead to significantly greater negative functional 397 
connecti vity between the  ventromedial prefrontal cortex and  amygdala during resting state fMRI . 398 
3c: Relative to PL, six weeks of BL will be associated with increased activation of the 399 
VMPFC, and reduced activation within the amygdala and dorso -medial prefrontal co rtex during the 400 
extinction recall scan . 401

3d: Relative to PL, six weeks of BL will be associated with increased levels of GABA and 402 
reduced glutamate in the amygdala -hippocampal complex and anterior cingulate gyrus as measured by 403 
proton magnetic resonance spe ctroscopy (1H MRS).  404 
3e: Relative to PL, six weeks of BL will produce increased levels of N -acetyl -aspartate 405 
(NAA), choline (Cho), and reduced phosphocreatine (Cr) within the amygdala -hippocampal complex and 406 
anterior cingulate gyrus.  407 
AIM  4:  The fourth Aim is to demonstrate whether changes in subjective and objective measures [ADDRESS_687424] longitudinal data examining changes in sleep patterns over time in 411 
individuals with PTSD and their correlation with these other metrics.  Thus, useful data will be acquired 412 
even if the primary hypot hesis of Aim 1 is not supported.  413 
Hypothesis 4 :  Improvements in sleep noted in Hypothesis 1, will be linearly correlated with 414 
improvements in cognitive and symptom functioning in Hypothesis 2 and structural and functional 415 
brain changes in Hypothesis 3.  416 
4a:  Changes in sleep parameters identified in Hypothesis 1 will correlate with 417 
improvements in memory, executive functioning, and neurop sychological performance on neurocognitive 418 
measures described in Hypothesis 2.  419 
4b: Changes in sleep param eters identified in Hypothesis 1 will cor relate with changes in 420 
neurochemistry  as outlined in Hypothesis 3d and 3e above.  421 
 422 
2) Lay Summary  (approximately 400 words ) [ADDRESS_687425] shown that 440 
this approach is extremely well tolerated and is effective for improving sleep, mood, cognitive 441 
performance, and brain function among individuals with brain injuries.  The protocol is actually less 442

Killgore in the University of Arizona Department of Psychiatry. There, subjects will complete personality 456 
assessments, a comprehensive cognitive assessment  battery, and several tests of motor functioning.  457 
  458 
 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Procedures:   The data collection will occur at the research - 459 
dedicated University of Arizona scanner facility that houses a new 3 Tesla magnet (see Equipment for 460 
description). For functional neuroimaging, audio and visual stimulus presentation equipment is available 461 
through the Resonance Technologies  headphone/goggle  system or high -definition MRI -compatible LCD - 462 
display (viewed through a mirror in the head cage).  An fMRI compatible EEG system including caps, 463 
cabling, and pre -amplifier is integrated with this space (see  Equipment for description).  Scanner data are [ADDRESS_687429]. Killgore.  466 
 In January 2013, the University of Arizona purc hased a Siemens Magnetom TIM Skyra 3T that is 467 
capable of high -resolution imaging capabilities. This whole -body 3.0T device will be configured with 48 468 
receiver channels and up to 204 integrated coil elements. It is capable of integrated parallel acquisition  469 
techniques and provides higher signal to noise in the parallel imaging mode than its predecessor, the Trio. 470 
The maximum acceleration factor using parallel imaging is 16 using either mSENSE or GRAPPA, and 471 
3D scanning can be accelerated in two directions (m aximum acceleration factor of 4 in second direction). [ADDRESS_687430] a maximum amplitude of 45 mT/m and a maximum slew rate of 200 T 473 
Tm-1s-1, yielding a minimum rise time of 225μs. The vector gradient performance (vector summation of 474 
all three gradient axes) results in a maximum effective amplitude of 78 mT/m and a maximal effective 475 
slew rate of 346 Tm-1s-1. All three gradient coils are force -compensated to reduce vibration and deliver 476 
superior eddy current performance. The water cooled gra dient amplifier has a maximum amplitude 477 
potential of 2,250 volts and a maximum current output of 750 amps. The instrument has a minimum slice 478 
thickness (in two dimensions) of 0.1 mm and a minimum partition thickness (in three dimensions) of 0.05 479 
mm. The in strument produces high sensitivity, with main field, or B0, homogeneity of 1.4 ppm VRMS for 480 
a 40 cm diameter spherical volume. Single shot EPI [INVESTIGATOR_529130] -weighted data sets 481 
with up to 256 directions of diffusion weighting are also a part of this instrument’s capability. It provides 482

 All structural and functional MRI studies will be conducted in concert with the University of 486 
Arizona Translational Bioimaing Resource . Subjects in this study will b e studied in a scanner that has a 487 
field strength of 3 Tesla. This field strength has been approved by [CONTACT_529149]. The 488 
three instruments are maintained by [CONTACT_529150]'s 489 
specifications on performance. For functional neuroimaging, audio and visual stimulus presentation 490 
equipment is available through the Resonance Technologies headphone/goggle system.  491 
 A research area, Room 1564 (400 square feet), located immediately adjacent to the 3.0 Te sla 492 
scanner, is equipped with 3 PC/Linux workstations and sgi O2 for data transfer and storage, image [ADDRESS_687432] external tampering using firewalls withi n the UAMC computer network.  495 
 Functional MRI is mostly done in MR3, a General Electric 3.0T HD Signa Excite scanner. It is 496 
equipped with Optimized ACGD Gradients (40mT/m, 150 mT/m/ms slew rate running 12x software). It is 497 
a 55cm diameter long bore magnet. This instrument is equipped with a head coil, 8 channel HR brain 498

General Procedure : Over a 4-year period, 108 participants between the ages of 1 8 and 50 will be 715 
recruited to participate  (to reach a final n of 90 subjects,  assuming 20% attrition) .  Participants will [ADDRESS_687463],  or recently discharged combat -exposed military personnel  717 
or DoD contractors  from Operat ion Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) meeting 718 
DSM -V diagnostic criter ia for PTSD , in addition to some non -military individuals who meet the DSM -V 719 
diagnostic criteria for PTSD .  Combat -exposed individuals  within 10 years of return from OIF/OEF will 720 
be eligible.   An age range of 18 -50 years has been selected to minimize possible developmental and 721 
degenerative effects that could be expected in younger and older subjects and to encompass the age range 722 
of the majority of military personnel.   723

Prior to data analysis,  subjects who consent will have a follow -up phone call where they will be 724 
administered the PCL -5, PHQ -9, and be asked about general sleep problems  using the ESS and ISI .  725 
The procedures will essentially be identical to those used successfully in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_529132] 726 
with mTBI.  Participants will attend three laboratory sessions (see Figure 10 below).  Visit [ADDRESS_687465] actigraph sleep monitor.  After a week of at home monitoring, each participant will 729 
return for Visit 2, which is involves comprehensive neurocognitive assessment, neuroimaging, fea r 730

randomly assigned to one of two light therapy conditions (n = 45 per group) differing only in the [ADDRESS_687466] condition , using computerized permuted block randomization to match groups by 734 
gender . Participants assigned to the active treatment condition will undergo 6 -weeks of at -home treat ment 735 
with a light device fitted with blue light (BL) diodes, while those assigned to the  Placebo (PL) condition [ADDRESS_687467] actigraph for the duration of the study.  During the 6 weeks 738 
of treatment, participants will use the light device for 30 -minutes each morning, within 2 -hours of 739 
awakening  (verified via light sensor built into the wrist actigra ph, daily time stamped electronic sleep 740 
diary , and compliance as measured by [CONTACT_529155]/time meter ).  After [ADDRESS_687468] Screening : Participants whose intake visits are scheduled more than six weeks after the date of [ADDRESS_687469] their eligibility.  748 
Intake Visit (Visit 1) :  Participants  will be given a full description of the study, have  the opportunity to 749 
ask questions, and will  provide written informed consent , and will be evaluated for PTSD severity using  750 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -V (SCID) . The Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire 751 
(MEQ) will be administered to assess c ircadian rhythm disturbances prior to light treatment. The combat 752 
exposure  scale (CES) will also be administered to participants with combat -related PTSD  to inform us of 753 
the extent and nature of combat exposure in military participants. T he Weschler Abbreviated Scale of 754 
Intelligence (WASI -II) will be administered to control for variation in intelligence levels amongst 755 
participants . The AUDIT and MUSE questionnaires will also be given to determine the degree and extent 756 
of alcohol and marijuana  use, though neither of these scales will be utilized as a means to determine 757

exclusion from the study.  The Rivermead Post -Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire (RPCSQ) will be [ADDRESS_687471]  immediately following the participant’s interview .  Female participants  will 764 
also provide information about their menstrual cycle (length of cycle and time since last menses) because [ADDRESS_687472] will be performed in the Department of Psychiatry.  All subjects will wear a heart rate 770 
monitor for the duration of this visit.  Selection criteria for all subjects are as follows:  [ADDRESS_687473] -worn  actigraph  to monitor sleep/wake 772 
patterns.  This device will also log exposure to light in three wavelengths (red, green, blue) to measure 773 
compliance with the protocol.  Participants will also be introduced to the online sleep diary coll ection 774 
system and will be given an automated email each morning reminding them to log in and complete the 775 
sleep diary.  776 
Visits 2 and 3: Assessment/Scanning Visits :  One week after Visit 1, participants will return for 777 
Visit 2 . Participants  will complete a d etailed demog raphic (Day of Scan Questionnaire (DSIQ)) and health [ADDRESS_687474] for 779 
the MRI scan where heart rate will be measured by [CONTACT_529156] M RI scanner. Subjects 780 
will complete a comprehensive baseline assessment  of neurocognitive and emotional functioning, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 781 
capacity, and resilience.  Participants will also undergo a validated de novo  fear conditioning and 782 
extinction procedure [98-101], and a series of functional neuroimaging and neurochemistry scans .  783 
Additionally, participants will complete subjective and objective measures of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_423320] 784 
throughout the day.  The following specific tasks and procedures will be administered during the 785 
assessment session:  786 
Emotional Functioning/Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/Sympto m Severity:  PTSD severity will be assessed using the [ADDRESS_687475] , Military Version (PCL -5), Patient Health Questionnaire 788 
(PHQ -9), and Clinician Administered PTSD Scale -5 (CAPS -5). Further assessment of psychopathology 789 
will b e made via administration of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II); Beck Anxiety Inventory 790 
(BAI); and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_73593] -Trait Anxiety Inventory  (STAI).  Participants will also complete  measure s 791 
resilience (Connor -Davidson Resilience Scale (CD -RISC)) , Evaluation of Risks (EVAR) , the Satisfaction 792 
with Life Scale (SWLS)  and the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ6) .  The Balloon Analogue Risk Test 793 
(BART) will be done to measure risk taking.  794 
Subjective Sleep Measures:  To assess general sleep quality, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and 795 
parasomnias, participants  will complete the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) [102], the Epworth 796 
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  [103], the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [104], and the Disturbing Dream and 797

three times during the assessment day . The Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) and 799 
Sleep Diaries A & B will also be done.   800 
Neurocognitive Assessment :  All participants wi ll complete a comprehensive neuro cognitive  801 
assessment battery to include:  802 
1. Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) .  The 803 
RBANS is a brief battery of well -normed neuropsychological tests  with two alternate forms (RBANS A 804 
and RBANS B) to permit repeated testing. The test provides several index scores, including: Total Score, 805 
Immediate Memory, Visuospatial/Constructional, Language, Attention, and Delayed Memory.  This brief [ADDRESS_687477]’s 812 
complete response , anything missed will be transcribed onto the RBANS form . The recording will then be 813 
deleted.  814 
2. Fear Conditioning Paradigm . Our group has developed a fear-conditioning/fear extinction 815 
paradigm that is highly effective at discriminating individuals with PTSD from healthy controls  [98-101].  816 
The protocol consists of 4 experimental phases: Habituation, Conditioning, Extinction and Extinction  [ADDRESS_687478] choose a level of mild 818 
electric shock that is “highly annoying but not 819 
painful” while being administered shocks of [ADDRESS_687479] imuli (CSs) consist of digital 823 
photographs of three differently colored vehicles  824 
(blue, red or yellow) displayed on a computer 825 
screen within the image of two different 826 
photographic environments (contexts), a 827 
“conditioning context” in which the 828 
unconditione d (shock) stimulus (US) 829 
accompanies certain CSs (CS+s) during 830 
Conditioning and an “extinction context” in 831 
which CS+s occur without USs during the Extinction and Extinction Recall phases.   Before each 832 
experimental phase except Habituation, subjects are told  they "may or may not be shocked." During 833 
Conditioning, 16 CS+’s (8 each of 2 different colors) are presented in the conditioning context and a 0.5 - 834 
sec US (shock) immediately follows the offset of 10 of 16 CS+ presentations (5 of the 8 of each CS+ 835 
color).  Sixteen randomly interspersed presentations of the third vehicle  color (CS -s) are never paired with 836 
the US. During the Extinction phase, one CS+ color (CS+E) appears 16 times in the extinction context, 837 
along with 16 interspersed CS -s and no USs. The other  CS+ color (CS+U) does not appear and therefore 838 
remains un -extinguished. During the Extinction Recall phase, the 8 CS+Es and 8 CS+Us are presented in 839 
the extinction context with 16 interspersed CS -s and no USs. The measurement of conditioned fear is 840

palm -recorded skin conductance response (SCR), a reliable index of sympathetic activation. Participants [ADDRESS_687481] (MSLT) :  Participants will undergo 3 MSLT procedures with 846 
polysomnographic (PSG) recording over the course of the assessment day.  A trained technician will fit [ADDRESS_687482] (PVT) :  The PVT is a 10 -minute computerized measure of 853 
sustained attention and psychomotor vigilance that has been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to sleep 854 
deprivation.  The PVT currently serves as the “gold standard” for assessing degradation in alertness and  855 
vigilance following sleep loss.   856 
Functional Neuroimaging :   Subjects will be screened for any contraindications to MRI and magnetic [ADDRESS_687483]’s [ADDRESS_687484] with a peripheral system such as a button, joystick, o r TV system before, during, or after 861 
the scan.  862 
Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will 863 
be collected  at the University of Arizona Translational Bioimaing Resource . The MRI hardware  and 864 
procedures immediately to follow are approved  by [CONTACT_1622]. A Siemens Skyra  3T whole body high -speed 865 
imaging device equipped for echo planar imaging  (EPI) (Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, NJ) will be 866 
used.  Head movement will be restricted using expandable foam cushions. After an a utomated scout 867 
image is acquired and shimming procedures performed to optimize field homogeneity, high -resolution 3D 868 
MPRAGE sequences (TR/TE/flip angle=7.25ms/3ms/7°) with an in -plane resolution of 1.3 mm, and 1 869 
mm slice thickness, will be collected for sp atial normalization, positioning the slice prescription, and for 870 
subsequent morphometric analysis. Then a T1 -weighted (TR/TE/flip angle=8sec/39msec/90°) and a T2 - 871 
weighted (TR/TE/flip angle=10sec/48ms/120°) sequence will be used to gather sets of images to assist in 872 
registration of the functional data to the high -resolution anatomical scan. Functional MRI images (blood 873 
oxygenation level dependent or BOLD; Kwong et al 1992) will be acquired using a gradient echo T2* - 874 
weighted sequence (TR/TE/flip angle= 2 sec/4 0msec/90°).  Prior to each scan, four images are acquired [ADDRESS_687485] ( whole brain acquisition; axonal  slices an gled 877 
perpendicular to the AC -PC line) with the same slice thickness ( 3.125 mm, skip 1mm; voxel size  3.125 x 878

1. Masked Affect Task (MAT) :  This task , first developed by [CONTACT_529157] -1990’s  881 
[110], presents a series of facial expressions displaying happi[INVESTIGATOR_529134], each for only 16 msec and 882 
masked immediately by a neu tral image from a different poser for 184 msec  (Figure 14).  At this rate of 883 
presentation, the “masked” affective expression is not consciously perceived, yet is still processed via an [ADDRESS_687487] to the amygdala that by[CONTACT_529158].  This task has been shown 885 
to selectively activate the amygdala in healthy participants.  Moreover, in our laboratory, exaggerated 886 
amygdala response has been found on this task in patients with PTSD [27].  Our laboratory has extensive 887 
experience usin g this task with patients with PTSD and  anxiety disorders [27, 111-115], and healthy 888 
adults and children [116-118]. 889 
2. Extinction Recall (ER) :  This task measures the 890 
retention of the extinction memory established during the 891 
previous fear conditioning session.  While undergoing fMRI, 892 
participants will view the previously conditioned images from 893 
the Fear Conditioning and E xtinction Task.  Here, 8 CS+E, 8 894 
CS+U, and 16 CS - trials will be presented (without any 895 
shocks).  Skin conductance responses will also be collected [ADDRESS_687488] will be CS+E vs. CS+U, permitting the 898 
isolation of psychophysiological and brain responses that are 899 
specific to extinction recall.  900 
3. Resting State Scan (RS) :  Emerging evid ence suggests 901 
that t he brain shows stable patterns of functional connectivity 902 
during the resting state and that these patterns may be 903 
particularly useful in elucidating specific networks [119-122].  904 
Therefore, in addition to the probe tasks described above subjects will also be scanned for 10 minutes 905 
with eyes closed and instructed to let their “mind wander.”  Functional connectivity will be evaluated [ADDRESS_687489] -treatment for the two conditions .   907 
4. Anticipation Task: The Emotional Anticipation Task was adapted on the basis of Aupperle  et al.’s 908

Spectroscopic Neuroimaging :   While all MRI 920 
hardware used during th is study is FDA -approved, a s part of the 921 
MRI session, one MRI sequence will be conducted  that uses 922 
investigational software that enables collection of unique 923 
spectroscopic data. This scan, referred to as the MEGA -PRESS 924 
sequence, uses Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) 925 
to measure chemicals in the brain, specifically, cerebral 926 
metabol ites and neurotransmitter concentrations.  It is very 927 
similar to other FDA -approved MRS sequences, but it does a 928 
better job at quantifying certain metabolites, namely, GABA.  929 
Per the Master Research Agreement (MRA) between Siemens 930 
and the University of Ari zona, as a Works in Progress (WIP), the 931 
MEGA -PRESS sequence complies with all FDA guidelines for 932 
magnetic resonance imaging (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory - 933

as a function of 6 -weeks of light therapy treatm ent and associated changes in sleep quality.  Growing 939 
evidence suggests that some of the deficits in memory and emotional regulation that occur for patients 940 
with PTSD are related to alterations in neurochemistry within key regions of the hippocampus and AC C 941 
(Karl & Werner, 2010).  In particular, patients with PTSD show decreased NAA in the hippocampus and 942 
ACC, as well as reduced concentrations of choline in the hippocampus and increased levels in the ACC.  943 
These are often compared directly as ratios relativ e to creatine (Cr).  Assuming that improved sleep leads [ADDRESS_687495] anterior to the genu of the corpus collosum and another placed at the 947

CAPS -2 symptom scores, mood scores, MRS metabolites).  The relationship between these change 1045

for normality will be conducted for all variables.  In the case on non -normality, appropriate data 1047

considered as falling into three types:  1) missing completely at random, 2) missing at random, or 3) [ADDRESS_687517] listwise deletion procedure.  However, assuming 1063  
that a larger number of values is missing, and data are not missing completely at random, we will be able 1064  
to apply missing data imputation methods.  1065  
Power Analysis :  A power analysis based on a proposed sample size of 90 subjects suggested that 1066  
with an omnibus 2 between -groups (BL vs. PL) x 2 within -subjects (pre - vs post -treatment) mixed design, [ADDRESS_687518] size (f = .25), and  = .05, there should p rovide be adequate  power to detect [ADDRESS_687519], the primary hypotheses of the study focus on interaction effects  across groups  (i.e., 1069

fMRI sig nal intensity changes; spectroscopic metabolite changes; etc.), with a two -tailed test at  = .05  1076  
(see Figure 16).  Thus, the proposed sample size of n = 45 per group appears to provide adequate power 1077  
for testing the major hypotheses of the proposed study.    1078

Functional Image Pre-Processing:   Functional neuro imaging data will be preprocessed in SPM 8 1079  
[123].  Following standard algorithms, function al images will be slice-time corrected, co -registered to [ADDRESS_687525] three -dimensional space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), spatially  smoothed 1082  
using an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full width half maximum [FWHM] = 6 mm), and resliced to 2x2x2 [ADDRESS_687526] Detection Tool 1086  
(ART) program.  Images with global intensities exceeding [ADDRESS_687527] motion parameters will also be included as nuisance regressors in the design 1089  
matrix.  1090  
FMRI Statistical Analysis :  At the first stage , activation during the conditions of interest will be [ADDRESS_687528] (e.g., ma sked affect) 1093  
relative to the activity associated with the control condition (e.g., simple perception of neutral facial 1094  
expressions).  Thus, for each subject, a “contrast image” will be produced that reflects the pattern of [ADDRESS_687529] images will be entered as the dependent variables in a series of random effects analyses in SPM8  1097  
[124].  Functional data will be a nalyzed from two approaches, including region of interest (ROI) analyses [ADDRESS_687530] (ROI) analyses will be performed.  The 1100  
primary hypotheses for the MAT involve changes in the amygdala, anterior cingulate gyrus, and 1101  
ventromedial prefrontal cortex for the MAT , whereas the  ACC and dorsolateral prefr ontal cortex are 1102  
hypothesized to differ across groups for the MSIT. Consequently, ROIs will be placed in these regions, 1103  
defined according to the boundaries of the published anatomical atlas of Tzourio -Mazoyer and colleagues 1104  
[125] and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_529139] [126].  These ROI analyses will be carried out at a n FDR small volume 1105  
corrected  threshold of p = .05, k (extent) = 10.  Each of the probe tasks has been selected because of its 1106  
prior involvement in the neuro circuitry of PTSD.  1107  
2. Whole Brain Exploratory Analyses .  Furthermore, whole brain analyses will be undertaken to 1108  
examine global patterns of activation for  each of the previously described analyses.  Because these 1109  
analyses will be exploratory in nature, they will be evaluated at a stringent correction for multiple 1110  
comparisons using a whole brain family -wise error (FWE) correction of p < .05, k = 10.  1111  
3. Resting  State Functional Connectivity Analysis :  Preprocessed resting state data will be 1112

subgenual and rostral ACC, VMPFC, and amygdala.  Data will be analyzed at an FDR corrected 1120  
significance level of p < 05.  1121  
MRS Analyses : The goal will be to determine whether BL treatment is more effective than PL at 1122  
altering bran metabolites that are associated with alertness, cognitive processing, and inhibitory capacity.  1123  
All MRS processing will be carried -out in a fully automated fashion us ing methods previously published 1124  
by [CONTACT_27156] [127].  Metabolite ratios will be derived as a ratio of each raw metabolite integral to the total [ADDRESS_687534] are Glu (excitatory neurotransmitter), GABA 1127  
(inhibitory neurotransmitter), and NAA (marker of neuronal energy production).  Standard linear and 1128  
mixed model approached will be employed for comp aring metabolite ratios between the active BL and 1129  
placebo light conditions within the dorsal ACC and amygdala -hippocampal complex.  As described 1130  
above, all analyses will be undertaken with α = .05, employing corrections for multiple comparisons (e.g., [ADDRESS_687535] -hoc corrections; Bonferroni corrections) as appropriate. We expect that the active BL 1132  
condition will lead to increased levels of GABA, N-acetyl -aspartate (NAA), and choline (Cho), and 1133  
reduced glutamate  and phosphocreatine (Cr) in the amygdala -hippoc ampal complex and anterior cingulate [ADDRESS_687536] condition.  Furthermore, it is expected that these changes will be linearly 1135  
related to changes in sleep parameters and cognitive/symptom score changes from pre - to post - 1136  
assessment.  1137  
8) Risks to subj ects [ADDRESS_687537] unique study identification 1146  
number.  1147  
 Subjects may find the sensation of the electric shock used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] -viewing task to be 1148  
uncomfortable. However, they will be able to choose their own level of shock, which should be strong 1149  
enough to annoying or uncomfortable, but not painful. The apparatus that provides the shock is powered 1150  
by a 9 -volt electric battery, identical to those used in toy electronics. These mild shocks are not dangerous 1151  
or harmful, but may be ann oying.  1152  
Unlike X -rays or CAT scans, magnetic resonance (MR) technology does not use ionizing [ADDRESS_687538] the images and data. With  the 1154

2019 ). During the scan, subjects will wear a birdcage coil around their heads; this is an FDA -cleared 1160  
device and its use in this study will be as approved by [CONTACT_8415].  1161  
 1162  
The four risks the FDA associates with MRI scanning are: 1) tissue heating due to RF fields, 2) 1163  
peripheral nerve stimulation due to quick changes in magnetic field,  3) hearing damage due to acoustic 1164  
noise, and 4) force and torque on magnetic materials in or on a participant. That said, the FDA lists “MRI 1165  
Devices within FDA specified parameters” as non -significant risk devices. The research scanner in the [ADDRESS_687542] for people with:  1174

• Implanted drug pumps  1181  
• Ear implants  1182  
• Eye implants or known metal fragments in eyes  1183

others)  1185  
• Other metallic surgical hardware in vital areas  1186  
• Certain tattoos with metallic ink  1187

filings, and, if so, they will not be able to participate in this study.  1195  
 1196  
Significant risks also can arise if certain materials (many types of metal objects) are brought into the 1197  
scanning area, as they can be pulled into the magnet at great speed , which might  cause serious injury. 1198  
Therefore, these types of items are not permitted in the scanning area. Subjects  will not be allowed to 1199  
bring anythin g with them  into the scanning room.  1200

The MR exams are painless, and except for pulsating sounds or vibrations, subjects will not be aware that [ADDRESS_687545] people experience no ill effects from these 1212  
scans, but some people do report claustrophobia (fear of being in enclosed small spaces), dizziness, mild 1213  
nausea, headaches, and a metallic taste in their mou th, double vision, or the sensation of flashing lights. 1214  
Some subjects also experience feelings of panic and/or anxiety. These symptoms are rare, and if present, 1215  
disappear shortly after leaving the scanner.  In addition to these physical risks, the MRI syste m can be 1216  
psychologically unsettling to some volunteers that are bothered by [CONTACT_529163].  1217  
 1218  
Volunteers can ask to be removed from the scanner at any point during the procedure without any 1219  
repercussions.  1220  
 1221  
Steps taken to minimize risk:  [ADDRESS_687546] three MRI risks described above, all sequences operate within the FDA limits of non - 1224  
significant risk. For the fourth risk, force/torque on magnetic materials, all volunteers are checked [ADDRESS_687547] w ill explain the MRI system and the scan that they are about to take part in. The 1229  
volunteer will be asked to lie down on the scanner bed. Some part of the volunteer ’s body may be covered [ADDRESS_687548] 1231  
with a peripheral system such as a button, joystick, or TV system before, during, or after the scan.  1232  
 1233  
Although both light device s (placebo [PL] and blue light [BLT]) are  safe to use  (Sliney, 2009 , 1234  
2006; Apollo Health , 2009 ), we will minimize unnecessary direct exposure to the bright lights to reduce [ADDRESS_687549] ever been reported, we want to minimize any 1242  
risks or discomforts. While extremely unlikely, it is possible that prolonged continuous staring at the 1243

 Thus, to minimize risk, subjects  will be instructed via the following for the goLITE Blu:  1251  
 1252  
NOTE: DO NOT STARE DIRECTLY AT THE LIGHTS ON THE LED PANEL.  1253  
IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT THE LIGHT REACHES YOUR EYES DIRECTLY FROM THE 1254

 There is the potential for skin irritation due to the heart rate monitor leads  or wearing the 1257  
actiwatch . This can be alleviated with use of lotions and/or creams.  1258  
 1259  
9) Potential benefits to subjects  and/or society  [ADDRESS_687552] benefit from participation in the proposed 1261  
study. However, it is anticipated that findings from this study will help to advance scientific and medical 1262  
understanding of treatment of PTSD and sleep disorders. The study will provide basic scientific 1263  
information about the effects of short wavelength light on sleep patterns and potential treatment of PTSD. 1264  
Such information may improve the ability to treat sleep disorders and cognitive performance among 1265  
patients with PTSD.  1266  
 1267  
Incidental MRI findings:  1268  
Study  assessments (labs, MR I scans, psychological  assessments, etc.) are not intended to provide medical 1269  
benefit. Personnel involved conducting this study may not be trained or licensed to clinically review lab 1270  
findings, MRI images, etc. If study personnel notice something irregular  in subjects’ study information, 1271  
the investigator may provide de -identified reports or images to a licensed physician, radiologists, or other 1272  
qualified practitioner for further review. In the unlikely case that such a qualified clinician determines a 1273  
findi ng to be an irregularity, subjects will be advised to consult their primary care physician. Subjects 1274

 1 Protocol Summary  
DESIGN  EPOC is designed to examine the feasibility of conducting point -of-care 
(POC) tests for SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_481056] a CE mark, emergency use authorization  
(EUA)  from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988  (CLIA ) waived. Participants 
and their providers will be instructed that the results of these tests are not to be used for patient management and the results of the tests will not be shared with participants or their providers. The 9 mL of blood will be 
processed locally and shipped to a central repository in the U S where it will 
be labeled with a specimen code that can only be matched to the 
participant’s other data using a participant identifier at the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center at the University o f Minnesota (UMN). UMN will 
only have the specimen code and the participant identifier: the matching of the participant identifier to a participant can only be done at the sites.  
In addition to this cross -sectional study (also referred to as the field test  
below), a nested case- control study utilizing specimens already collected 
from participants in the Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID -19 (TICO)  
trial will be conducted. Participants in the TICO trial have already consented to the use of their specimens for future research on COVID -19. The POC 
tests will be conducted on these specimens and compared to results that have already been generated using an assay at a central laboratory called the GenScript cPass assay (referred to here as the GenScript assay) . 
The [ADDRESS_481057] and the RightSign
 COVID -19 IgG/IgM 
Rapid Test . Both platforms will be used on all specimens.  It is not the goal of 
this study to impact the indicatio ns for either test.  
The primary objective of the field test is to test for an association between the outcome of the locally obtained POC test and the centrally obtained result from the GenScript assay on a blood sample obtained at the same time as the sam ple for the POC test s.  
The primary objective of the nested case- control study  is 
to test for an 
association between the POC test result on stored baseline specimens and 
the primary efficacy outcome in TICO on a subset of specimens from TICO 
participants for whom the GenScript assay result has already been 
determined. Since conducting P OC assays on large numbers of stored 
specimens is time consuming (since each assay takes [ADDRESS_481058] be analysed), a case -control design will be 
utilized. The case definition is death or time to sustained recovery that 
exceeds 28 days. To maximize the difference between cases and controls, 
controls are defined as those with a time to sustained recovery of no more 
than 16 days. With these definitions there are 68 cases and 77 controls for a 
total sample size of 145. Of the se participants,  104 experienced a sustained 
recovery (the primary outcome in TICO) and [ADDRESS_481059] involve the consent 
process, 2 POC tests, and completion of a case report form ( CRF) and a 
blood draw, thus we expect participation to last no more than a few hours.  
SAMPLE 
SIZE  Sample size for th e cross -sectional study  is targeted at 375. With this 
sample size  the study will have 83% power for detecting a difference in the 
probability of a positive test between [ADDRESS_481060] discordanc e is 3%.  
The sample size for the nested case- control study is 145. Analysis of the 
case -control population using the GenScript assay detected a sub- hazard 
ratio of 1.91. With a sub-hazard ratio of 1.91, 104 events provide 90% power 
for rejecting the null hypothesis that the sub-hazard ratio is 1 and this 
number of events provides 80% power for a sub-hazard ratio of 1.75.  
POPULATION  The population for the field test was selected to match that of those 
participating in the TICO trials from which the case- control specimens were 
selected. This population consisted of adults hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191544] -[ADDRESS_481061] received neutralizing monoclonal 
antibodies ( nMabs ), SARS -CoV-2 hyperimmune intravenous 
immunoglobulin (hIVIG),  or convalescent plasma. For this protocol 
participants must not have received these compounds  within 6 months prior 
to collection of the blood samples for this protocol. Participants with severe 
disease (as defined by a list of conditions and interventions) are also 
excluded to be consist ent with the TICO trials from which specimens will be 
used.

 2 Introduction  
 Study Rationale  
A platform trial of therapeutics for patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191544] -19 entitled “A Multicenter , 
Adaptive, Randomized, Blinded Controlled Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Investigational 
Therapeutics for Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103129] -19”, referred to as Therapeutics for 
Inpatients with COVID -19 (TICO), has undertaken the investigation of 6 treatments thus far. 
TICO trials of bamlanivimab, sotrovimab (also known as VIR -7831) , and BRII -196/198, a meta-
analysis that included these trials , a trial of hIVIG , and the RECOVERY trial have identified the 
potential for baseline antibody levels to impact safety and efficacy outcomes with administration 
of nMab therapy1,2,3,4,5,6. The TICO trial  of bamlanivimab found a statistically significant 
interaction for the primary efficacy outcome,  and the TICO  trial of BRII-196/[ADDRESS_481062] not yet mounted an antibody response, patients with endogenous antibody probably 
do not benefit from this treatment , and this may res ult in misuse of resources and expose 
patients to unnecessary toxicity, increased costs, and treatment delays. Moreover, in addition to 
affecting response to therapy, results from the TICO trials also demonstrate that baseline 
antibody levels were predicti ve of safety and efficacy outcomes in the placebo group: those with 
endogenous antibody had better outcomes.  
In the TICO trials, antibody levels were assessed using a surrogate neutralizing antibody assay 
that detects the ability of antibodies to block the interaction of the receptor binding domain 
(RBD) of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_384600] -2 receptor ( the GenScript cPass assay, referred to 
as the GenScript assay here). While these results point to promising approaches to the 
provision of care, these res ults are of limited clinical value as the use of this assay for patient 
management is extremely challenging due to time and laboratory requirements. This is due to 
the requirement that the assay be run in batches at a central laboratory , and this delays th e 
determination of the presence of endogenous antibody . Given the urgency of treatment early in 
the course of disease , this delay could impact patient outcomes.   
There are a large number of POC antibody tests with an EUA  from the FDA  available for 
detectio n of antibodies to SARS -CoV-2, thereby [CONTACT_384617][INVESTIGATOR_384601] a patient has endogenous antibodies , which can then be used for patient management . Under 
the current EUAs, these tests only produce a qualitative interpretation of serostatus. This limits 
their ability to be used for participant management as the cut -offs are generally selected to 
optimize specificity. Optimization of specificity is sensible for an assay designed for large scale screening , where false positives are the primary concern. In contrast, if there is a safety concern 
associated with administration of nMabs to those who are seropositive, false negatives are the 
primary concern. Hence, there is interest in studying POC antibody tests that produce a rapid 
quantit ative result so that the operating characteristics of different cut -offs can be investigated.  
This would inform  using other cut -offs for timely patient management.  
There are [ADDRESS_481063] for patient management: 1) performance of the POC test in a hospi [INVESTIGATOR_384602] ; and 2) the ability of the results from 
the POC test to re produce the association of baseline antibody levels with clinical outcomes  that 
has been found with the GenScript assay . While the former will be examined prospectively at 
clinical sites that enrol l patient s, the latter will use stored specimens from completed TICO trials  
for expeditious evaluation of the association of POC test results with major  TICO  outcomes  in 
the context of treatment with nMabs (e.g., a 90-day composite safety outcome and time to 
sustained recovery , the primary endpoint of TICO trials ). Ideally , one would want to determine if 
INSIGHT [ADDRESS_481064] better outcomes as was observed using the GenScript assay.  
This protocol will exa mine  2 POC platforms: the LumiraDX and the RightSign platforms. Both 
platforms have a US FDA EUA and a CE mark for a CLIA -waiver  when used on fingerstick 
whole blood . The LumiraDX platform provides a qualitative result in 10- 20 minutes and can also 
provide a quantitative assessment, but this cannot be provided at the POC at this time.  (A 
quantitative POC test is currently under development by [CONTACT_3455]) . The RightSign 
platform is exclusively qualitative with a 1 0-20-minute turnaround time.  Table 1 pr ovides further 
information and links to more detailed information about each assay. Both assays are certified under the CLIA, 42 U.S.C. §263a, that meet requirements to perform medium  complexity tests.  
Nothing is known at this time about the performance of either assay on emerging variants of concern.

Table 1: Further information about the [ADDRESS_481067] been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391]- 19. A manuscript providing details on the protocol has been published7 
so here a brief description of the trial is provided. As a platform  trial, m ultiple agents can be 
investigated simultaneously which allows for efficiencies due to a shared placebo group.  Each 
investigational agent is studied in a randomized placebo- controlled trial with an early futility 
assessment based on two  7-category  ordinal outcomes assessed at day 5 of follow- up to 
assess efficacy and a composite of grade 3 and 4 adverse events ( AEs) , serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ), clinical organ failure or serious infection or death through day [ADDRESS_481068] 4 being n Mabs or combinations of 
nMabs . These agents are as follows:  
1. Bamlanivimab . 
2. Sotrovimab (also referred to as VIR -7831) . 
3. BRII- 196/198.  
4. AZD7442 . 
5. MP0420 . 
6. PF-[ADDRESS_481069] 3 
trials (n=32 0) found that being seropositive was associated with superior efficacy and safety 
outcomes. Competing risk regression was used to test for an association between the baseline 
qualitative result from the GenScript assay and time to sustained recovery. The result was 
statistically significant with a sub -hazard ratio of 1.4 5 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 
(1.17, 1.81). The estimated hazard ratio for death (positive/negative) was 0.17 with a 95% CI of 
(0.05, 0.57), hence also statistically significant6. 
While the semi -quantitative GenScript results do not have any authorization for use in patient 
management , there is evidence that the use of different thresholds for dichotomizing this semi -
quantitative result leads to different estimates of the magnitude of the association between the 
antibody test and time to sustained recovery. By [CONTACT_2329] a lower threshold for antibody levels  and 
thereby [CONTACT_384618] , one detects 
a stronger association. The threshold used for the qualitative result finds that 46 % of the 32 0 
participants in the placebo arm are sero positive. If the threshold is lowered so that 58% of the 
participants are seroposi tive, we find that the sub -hazard ratio increases from 1.[ADDRESS_481070]

Principle of the assay: The test works using microfluidics. S erum, plasma, venous whole 
blood, or fingerstick whole blood are applied  to the sample application area of the t est strip and 
inserted in the i nstrument . Each test strip contains 4 channels: [ADDRESS_481073] strip. The qualitative results are displayed on the Instrument 
touchscreen in approximately 11 minutes from the addition of sample  as “Positi ve +” or 
“Negative -”. The semi -quantitative measure of the fluorescence can be accessed as research 
use only.   
2.3.2  RightSign COVID -19 IgG/IgM r apid test 
Assay summary:  The RightSign COVID -19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette is a lateral flow 
immunochromatographic assay for the detection of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_481074] is run on a disposa ble lateral flow device (test cassette). The 
test targets IgG or IgM antibodies specific for the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_135885]. The readout of the assay is 
qualitative: positive for IgG and/or IgM or negative within 10- [ADDRESS_481075] 
positive polymerase chain reaction ( PCR)  test. Averaging over the number of days since first 
known positive  test the sensitivity of the IgM assay is 93% , while the sensitivity of the IgG assay 
is 94%. Specificity was estimated using 210 specimens known to be negative and the result was negative for IgM 206 times and negative for IgG 209 times. This gives an estimated specificity of 
98% with a 95% CI of (95%, 99%) for IgM , and an estimated specificity of 100% with a 95% CI  
of (97%, 100%) for IgG
9. For analyses that simply treat the Rig htSign assay as positive or 
negative, the RightSign test will be considered positive if the test is positive for IgM or IgG.

Table 4: Sensitivity of the RightSign IgG assay for various numbers of days from a positive test.  
Principle of the assay: This test uses anti -human IgM antibody (test line IgM), anti -human IgG 
(test line IgG) and goat anti -mouse IgG (control line C) immobilized on a nitrocellulose strip. The 
conjugate pad contains recombinant SARS -CoV-2 antigen ( based on the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_384604]) conjugated with colloid gold. During testing, the specimen binds with SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_481076] cassette. When a specimen followed 
by [CONTACT_384619], I gM and/or IgG antibodies if present, will bind to 
COVID -19 conjugates making an antigen -antibod y complex. This complex migrates through the 
nitrocellulose membrane by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_117815]. When the complex meets the line of the corresponding immobilized antibo dy (anti -human IgM &/or anti -human IgG) , the complex is 
trapped forming a colored line which confirm s a reactive test result. Absence of a colored line in 
the test region indicates a non- reactive test result. To serve as a procedural control, a colored

[ADDRESS_481077]  (so, up to 4 fingersticks may occur ). In addition,  
a 9mL blood specimen will be collected . Participants and care providers will not be informed of 
test outcomes. After the fingersticks, blood collection, and responses to a set of standardized 
questions from a CRF, the participant will have  completed involvement  with the study. The 
blood specimen will allow for both a comparison with the GenScript assay and the assessment of the impact of processing, freezing,  and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_384605]. There will also be a 
nested case- control study to understand how POC test s carried out on stored plasma 
specimens from completed TICO trials  are related to outcomes measured in the TICO protocol. 
Consent from TICO participants has already been obtained for the use of their  stored 
specimens , so the case- control study will not involve a dditional  consent  or the recruitment and 
follow- up of patients .  

INSIGHT [ADDRESS_481078] on site as per the instruments’ instructions ( using blood from a fingerstick), a blood 
specimen w ill be obtained for  processing,  freezing , and ship pi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] a central lab for central 
testing using the GenScript assay and repeat POC testing using plasma.  If a POC test is 
indeterminate  the test will be repeated [ADDRESS_481079] will not be conducted again on that participant. This procedure applies to POC testing at 
the sites and at the central laboratory.  
A nested case- control study will also be conducted to allow for testing of the association 
between antibody levels at baseline , as assessed by [CONTACT_384620], 
sotrovimab , and B RII-196/[ADDRESS_481080] . 
There are also a  number of secondary objectives that will investigate the feasibility of this 
approach,  and others that will help interpret the outcome of the primary objective. These are as 
follows:  
1. Determine t he frequency with which the POC test fails to give an unambiguous  result.  
2. Determine the time required to obtain a  POC  result.  
3. Determine  the magnitude of the association between the locally obtained POC test result  
by [CONTACT_941] 20- [ADDRESS_481081] of  processing (centrifugation for 
plasma),  freezing , storing , and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_384606] [ADDRESS_481082] result on stored 
baseline specimens and the primary efficacy outcome in TICO  on a subset of specimens from 
TICO  participants for whom the GenScript assay has  result has already been determined . 
Secondary objectives are as follows : 
1. Test for an association between each POC test result on stored baseline specimens and 
efficacy/ safety outcomes in TICO  in a case- control design.  
2. Compare the POC test results to the GenScript  results  and other antibody test results 
such as those from Bio- Rad and Quanterix  that have already been obtained  for these 
stored specimens . 
3. Select a threshold for the quantitative LumiraDX result to optimize the association between the dichotomized assay  result and safety and efficacy outcomes using the 
stored specimens.  
4. Compare the 2 POC platforms to each other and the GenScript result using locally (at 
each site) and centrally determined POC results.  
5. Examine associations between these antibody assays an d antigen assays which have 
already been obtained for the stored specimens.  
6. Determine the effect of vaccination and other participant characteristics on the antibody test results.  
 Sample Size and Statistical Considerations  
3.3.[ADDRESS_481083] result  
The power for comparisons of results from paired qualitative  tests on specimens was assessed 
using Schlesselman’s formula for the power of McNemar’s chi -square test10. This requires 
specification of the odds ratio and the probability of [ADDRESS_481084] being positive when the other is negative (denoted p
01 in the table) . Table [ADDRESS_481085] being positive while the other is 
negative. For example, p 01=0.[ADDRESS_481086] is positive while the other is negative are 0.0 1 and 0.0 22, and the probability that the 2 tes ts 
agree is 96.8 %. As can be seen in Table 5, with a sample size of [ADDRESS_481087] is 
low in this scenario  (0.24) , but this is fairly strong agreement across the assays. As can be seen 
from the same table, t he test will have over 80% power if p 01=0.[ADDRESS_481088] 
2.6. This corresponds to the discordance probabilities of 0.0 3 and 0. 078 and the corresponding 
probability that the 2 tests agree is 89 .2%. With this configuration of probabilities for test 
agreement the standard error  for the difference in the probability that the 2 tests are positive is 
0.023. There is currently no data available for this comparison.

 Table 5: The power of McNemar’s  chi-square test for testing the agreement of [ADDRESS_481089] using the R ightSign platform and the GenScript assay  using stored specimens  for both 
assays . The association depends on which isotype is measured with the R ightSign assay: there 
is evidence that the odds ratio is different from 1 for IgM (odds ratio 7.5 , p<0.001 ) but not for 
IgG (odds ratio 1.1 , p=0.82 ). These preliminary data indicate that [ADDRESS_481090] will provide more than adequate power for detecting a difference for the 
GenScript assay and R ightSign IgM assay and very low power for detecting a difference 
between the GenScript assay and the Right Sign IgG assay due to the high degree of 
association between the latter pair of assays . 
3.3.3  Case- control comparison  
An analysis of the qualitative GenScript result with the 145 patients that will be used for the 
nested case- control study found a significant difference (p=0.002) in the time to sustained 
recovery, with a sub- hazard ratio of 1.91 (95% CI: 1.35, 2.7) for baseline serostatus, indicating 
that seropositive patients had a quicker  time to sustained recovery . (This used the Fine- Gray 
approach to model ling competing risks). The quantitative result from this assay also 
demonstrated a statistically significant association with time to sustained recovery and adjustment for study level e ffects did not impact the associations meaningfully. An analysis of 
case control status also detected an odds ratio that was significantly different from 1 (p=0.015) 
with an odds ratio of 2.34 (95% CI: 1.18, 4.65).  
With a sub -hazard ratio of 1.91, 104 even ts provide 90% power for rejecting the null hypothesis 
that the sub -hazard ratio is 1,  and this number of events provides 80% power for a sub-hazard 
ratio of 1.75. An analysis of case control status has lower power and would require an odds ratio of 2.[ADDRESS_481091] 80% power for detecting an association between baseline antibody levels and 
case control status with this sample size (larger than what was observed for the GenScript 
assay).  
 Participant Selection  for the Field Test  
Interested s ites will be selected  based on their ability to recruit patients that meet the eligibility 
criteria for TICO . Planned enrol lment into TICO is not necessary for participation in the field tes t. 
All participants will need to consent to participate in the field test component of the protocol , 
including those co-enrolled  in TICO . The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the field test are as 
follows:  
3.4.1  Inclusion criteria  
1. Age ≥ 18 years . 
2. Informed consent by [CONTACT_12718]’s legally  authorized representative 
(LAR) for up to [ADDRESS_481092] (NAT) or equivalent 
testing within 3 days prior to consent  OR documented by [CONTACT_384621] 3 days prior to consent  AND progressive disease suggestive of ongoing 
SARS- CoV-2 infection per the responsible investigator . (For non -NAT tests, only 
INSIGHT [ADDRESS_481093] will also 
be used for this protocol. ) 
4. Duration of symptoms attributable to COVID -19 ≤ 12 days per the responsible 
investigator . 
5. Requiring admission for inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_384607] -19, per the responsible investigator, and NOT for purely 
public health or quarantine purposes.  
3.4.2  Exclusion criteria  
1. Prior receipt of  SARS- CoV-2 hIVIG, convalescent plasma from a person who 
recovered from COVID -19, or SARS -CoV-2 nMAb within 6 months of  the blood 
draws for testing as part of this protocol . 
2. Disease severity beyond that of stratum 1 in the TICO trial.  
This includes the following conditions:   
    a. stroke  
    b. meningitis  
    c. encephalitis  
    d. myelitis  
    e. myocardial infarction  
    f. myocarditis  
    g. pericarditis  
    h. symptomatic congestive heart failure ( CHF; [LOCATION_001] Heart Association  
 [NYHA ] class III -IV)  
    i. arterial or deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism  
Or current requirement f or any of the following:  
    a. high- flow supplemental oxygen  
    b. non- invasive ventilation  
    c. invasive mechanical ventilation  
    d. extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  
    e. mechanical circulatory support  
    f. vasopressor therapy  
    g. commencement of renal replacement therapy at this admission (i.e. , not    
         patients on chronic renal replacement therapy) . 
3. In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_341546], any condition for which, participation 
would not be in the best interest of t he participant or that could limit protocol 
specified assessments . 
A blood specimen for storage is required for participation in the study.  
These eligibility requirements are nearly identical to those used in the TICO trial from which 
specimens will be use d for the case- control study. One major difference is that TICO 
participants must agree to not participate in other COVID -19 treatment trials until after Day 5 
(this is clearly not relevant for this protocol) . The exclusion criteria here are more restrictive than 
those in the TICO trial. This is so participants in this protocol are comparable to those who 
enrolled in the TICO trials from whom  specimens will be used for the case- control study. Those 
trials had more restrictive exclusion criteria than listed in the TICO protocol at the request of the FDA and match the exclusion criteria listed here.  This will facilitate interpretation of analyses 
that use specimens from the field test and from the previously conducted trials . Eligibility criteria 
were  also selected to be similar to those in the TICO trial to ensure these results are relevant for 
INSIGHT 017                                                                                                                 Version 1.0

 future trials in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_384608].  
Participant c haracteristics will be monitored during data collection and adjustments to the 
characteristics of those recruited for participation may be made.  
 Data and Blood Collection Plan  
After providing written informed consent, a CRF  will be completed for each parti cipant  and blood 
will be collected  by [CONTACT_8622] 4 fingersticks and by a venous blood draw  of 9 mL (in an EDTA 
collection tube for aliquoting plasma after centrifugation into 4 2 mL cryovials, each with about 1 
mL of plasma) . The blood from the fingerstick s will be used to conduct the POC tests and the 
plasma cryovials will be stored locally in a - 70°/-80° freezer  until they can be shipped to the 
central biorepository . The CRF will capture the outcome of the POC tests, the length of time 
from the start of th e assay to recording the test outcome, and selected data collected  on the 
TICO Screening and Baseline and Randomization form s. This will include  
1. Participation in other INSIGHT studies .  
2. Demographics . 
3. Date of onset of COVID -[ADDRESS_481094] be performed within 24 hours  of completing the written informed consent.  
Information will be collected from  site staff about  ease of use of each platform.

 Field Evaluation of Platforms: Ease of Use, Time for Test Result  
The number and proportion of failed tests and tests not obtained within [ADDRESS_481095] if the odds ratio for the association is 1 using McNemar’s chi -
square test  with a significance level of 0.05.  Samples for which either test result is missing will 
be excluded from this analysis. This test will be supplemented by a 95% CI for the difference in 
the probability of testing positive. Site level effects will be estimated by [CONTACT_384622] a logistic link with pairs of results modelled as 
INSIGHT 017                                                                                                                 Version 1.0

 being correlated  (the test  outcome is the binary outcome) . This model will include fixed effects 
for the test type (i.e., local or central) and site. Sites may be grouped based on geography or 
ICC membership to improve the precision of site level estimates and the interaction betwe en 
site and test type will be investigated. Subgroups based on age, existence of an 
immunocompromising condition and vaccination status will be investigated  (provided enough 
individuals with an immunocompromising condition enrol l). These subgroup analyses will test for 
an interaction between group membership and test type.  This analysis will be used for both 
POC tests , and there will not be an adjustment for the conduct of the [ADDRESS_481096] Result versus GenScript cPass 
Assay  
The GenScript assay  will also be conducted on the specimens at the central laboratory.  The 
locally and centrally determined POC results will be compared to the GenScript result  using 
McNemar’s chi -square test and will be supplemented by 95% CI s for the difference in the 
probability of testing positive. Investigation of site effects and test performance in subgroups will 
be pursued as described in Section 4.2.  
 Association of POC T est Results with TICO Outcomes: A Nested 
Case-Control Study of Completed TICO Trials  
TICO s pecimens selected for the case- control study will be shipped from the repository at 
Advanced Biomedical Labs LLC  to the central laboratory for analysis . The Fine -Grey approach 
to competing risk regression will be used to test for an association between the POC test result 
and time to sustained recovery while controlling for the parent sub- study effect. A significance 
level of 0.[ADDRESS_481097], the GenScript result for the stored specimens and the POC results for the stored specimens. This analysis w ill use generalized estimating equations for binary 
outcomes with effects for the type of assay (3 values), if the assay was conducted locally or 
centrally , and in which protocol/sub- study the participant enrolled. The association due to the 
specimen coming from the same person w ill be accounted for by [CONTACT_384623] a 
clustering eff ect in the model. Tests for differences in the assays w ill be based on the Wald test 
for the regression coefficients for the assays.  No multiplicity adjustment will be made for these 
tests.  
Associations between qualitative antibody and continuous antigen assays will be examined 
using 2 by 2 tables by [CONTACT_384624] a given 
trial, and Fisher’s exact test will be used to test for an association. Logistic regression models 
will be used to compute adjusted odds ratios where adjustment will be made for parent study and site (where sites may be grouped as described above).  
INSIGHT [ADDRESS_481098] (i.e., the ranks of the LumiraDX results for positive and 
negative results for the other assays will be compared) . Adjusted analyses will be pursued using 
linear regression after trans formation (e.g., logarithmic) , if appropriate. Comparisons of the 
locally and centrally conducted Lum iraDX assay will be conducted using linear regression with 
adjustments made by [CONTACT_384625]. The quantitative result will also be 
used in the competing risk regression models as a continuous covariate and as a set of 
indicator variables that represent the quartiles of the distribution of this assay (to avoid the linearity assumption).  
Other approaches to dichotomizing the quantitative LumiraDX results will be investigated and 
assessed . Potential values to use for dichotomizing the results will be based on deciles of the 
distribution and for each potential threshold the sub -hazard ratio for the impact of baseline 
serostatus on time to s ustained recovery will be computed. An alternative cut -off may be 
selected if there are substantial differences in the hazard ratios.  
[ADDRESS_481099] participants’ identity are described in Section 5.5 below.  
 Participating Clinical Sites and Local Review of Protocol and 
Informed Consent  
This study will be conducted by [CONTACT_384626], including especially NHLBI networks. It is anticipated that potential participants will be 
recruited by [CONTACT_55794] (and/or their delegates, as appropriate) and/or that positive 
SARS- CoV-2 laboratory testing will be used to enquire about potential enrol lment. Information 
about this study will be disseminated to health care workers at enrolling sites.  
Prior to the initiation of the study at each clinical research site, the protocol, informed consent form and any participant information materials will be submitted to and approved by a 
central/national institutional review board ( IRB)/ethics committee ( EC) and/or the site’s local 
IRB/EC as required. Likewise, any future amendments to the study protocol will be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_78626](s) or EC(s). After IRB/EC approval, sites must register for this 
study before screening potential participant s and must register for any protocol amendments. 
Protocol registration procedures are described in the protocol instruction manual ( PIM). 
 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki in its current versi on; the 
requirements of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as defined in Guidelines, European Union

for Human Research Protections (OHRP); or with the local law and regulation, whichever 
affords greater protection of human subjects.  
 Informed Consent of Study Pa rticipants  
Informed consent must be obtained (see sample in Appendix A ) prior to conducting any 
study -related procedures. For patients who are incapacitated, informed consent may be 
obtained from a LAR.  Capacity will be assessed according to local standards and policies. 
Local standards and policies will also determine who is legally authorized to consent for an 
individual who is incapacitated.  Should the individual regain capacity during the study, their 
direct consent should be obtained at the ear liest opportunity.  
Electronic consent may be used when a validated and secure electronic system is in place to 
do so, if in compliance with national legislation and approved by [CONTACT_1036]/EC. Other 
methods of obtaining documentation of consent may be us ed when site staff are unable to be 
in direct contact [CONTACT_4490] a potential participant or a LAR due to infection- control restrictions.  No 
matter how the participant’s consent is obtained and documented, it is expected that consent 
will be preceded by [CONTACT_384627] (or their LAR) to have questions answered. Sites should follow 
all available local or national guidance on suitable methods for obtaining documentation of 
participant (or  their LAR) consent.  
 Confidentiality of Study Participants  
The confidentiality of all study participants will be protected in accordance with GCP 
guidelines and national regulations , including the US Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1 996 (HIPAA) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 
EU 2016/679) .  
 Regulatory Oversight  
As previously stated, all sites will conduct the trial in accordance with the requirements of GCP as codified in their local law and regulation, under the oversight of their institution and 
competent regulatory authority.  
As part of fulfilling GCP requirements for adequate trial monitoring, multiple modalities will be employed.  
6 Storage and Use of Specimens  
The plasma obtained from participants will be sent to a central biorepository in the US. In 
addition to the antibody and antigen tests described in this protocol, these specimens will be 
available for further study of SARS -CoV-2 and COVID -19. Any future use of these specimens 
will be reviewed and approved by a scientific steering committee overseeing research 
conducted by [CONTACT_384628]. Results of these tests will not be shared with participants or their clinicians. Aggregated results of such tests will be presented. No individual results will be linked to a study participant.

What is being studied? 
The COVID -[ADDRESS_481101] only been studied in people who are not in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  We are doing this study to see if it is easy for these tests to be used right at your bedside in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  This is called a “p oint-of-care” (POC) test.  
 
We are looking at [ADDRESS_481102] to do in the study? 
If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you about what other medical conditions you have, what symptoms you are having, and what medicines you have gotten to treat your KEY INFORMATION  
• You can join the study if you are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103182] -[ADDRESS_481103] gotten sicker 
from COVID -19. 
• If you agree to be in the study, you will have two finger sticks to draw 
blood.  This will be tested on two different point -of-care (rapid) tests.   
• You will also have a small amount of blood drawn from your arm to be 
tested in a central laboratory.  
• Once you have done this, you are done with the study.  
• There are minor risks to having blood drawn from your arm, but this risk is not di fferent from blood draws that are already being done for your 
regular care.  
• There are no direct benefits to you from being in this study.  You will help 
us learn more about how these rapid tests work in people in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_384610] -19. 
• This study does  not include any treatments apart from your usual care.  
You and your doctor will decide how to treat your COVID -19. 
• You do not have to be in this study.  You can stop being in the study at 
any time.  This will not change your medical care or other benefit s.

 We will take about 9 milliliters (a little less than 2 teaspoons) of blood from a vein in your 
arm using a needle.  We will send these samples to a central laboratory in the [LOCATION_002].  More information is below.  
 Once you have done these things,  you are done with this study.   
 This study does not provide any treatment for COVID -19.  You do not have to be in this 
study if you do not want to be.  If you agree to be in the study, you can stop at any time.  Your decision about whether to be in this study or to stop the study will not change your usual medical care or any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.   
 The study will pay for the tests that are part of this study.  
 [The next paragraph is for US sites only.  Sites in other countries should delete the next 
paragraph and replace it with the language appropriate for your location.]  
You, your insurance company, or some other third- party payer must pay for any 
medicines or other tests for your COVID -19 and for your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680].  
 
What are the risks and benefits of being in this study?  
The only risks to you to be in this research study are the risk of having blood taken and 
the possibility that someone could find out you are in the study.  These risks are small and are the same as risks you already have from your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].  Having blood 
taken may be a little painful. You may have a bruise where the needle goes in.  In rare 
cases, people have fainted or gotten an infection after having blood taken.   
 You will not get any direct benefit f rom being in this study, but it may help others in the 
future if we can get a better understanding of how new tests for COVID -19 work.   
 
What do we do with the samples at the central laboratory?  
The study will test the blood samples to compare the results of the [ADDRESS_481105] your genes (DNA).  We will not  sell your samples and they will not  be 
used for research aimed at making money (commercial research).  The laboratory where the samples are stored will not have any information that could identify you.  
 How do we protect your privacy? 
We will take  every reasonable step to keep your health information private and to keep 
anyone from misusing it.  Your information (data) and samples will not be identified by 
[CONTACT_2300], or in any other way, in anything published about this study.  You will be identified only by a code.  We will not release information from your records without your written permission.

involved with this study cannot see your research and medical information.  We will keep your information in a safe place and will handle your personal information very 
carefully.   
 
Your study data are sent electronically to the UMN in the US through a secure 
application.  By [CONTACT_30112], you agree to having your data sent to UMN.  No information that could directly identify you is sent to UMN.  In this information, you are

                                                                                                                          26 December 2021

 identified only by a code number, your year of birth, and a 3 -letter code that you or the 
study staff choose.  This is called “pseudonymized data”.   The UMN limits access to the 
data through security measures, and no data breach or unauthorized access has ever occurred in this system.  After the study is over, the data will be stored securely for as long as the law requires.  
 We will share your study data with the US N IH (which is paying for this study), and with 
regulators that oversee the study.  We are r equired by [CONTACT_384629].   UMN may share 
your data and blood sample with other people who study COVID -19.  UMN will remove 
the code number, year of birth, and 3 -letter code from your data before sharing.  This is 
called “anonymizing the data” and makes it  impossible for anyone to link the data back 
to you.  We will not ask you for additional consent for this sharing.  UMN will only share data for research projects that are approved by [CONTACT_30124].  
 For one of the new tests we are studying, the LumiraDX test, t he test results will be sent 
through the internet to LumiraDX’s computers.  They are sent in a secure way and the information is encrypted (coded so no one can read it unless they have a special key).  LumiraDX will then send this data to the UMN in a secure way.  LumiraDX uses this test in many countries around the world and must follow the privacy laws of those countries, including the countries where this study is being done.   
 The test results sent to LumiraDX include the time, date, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_384612].  The only information that LumiraDX will have that could be linked to you personally is a number on the kit used to take your blood.  This is a different code 
number than what is on the data that your site sends to UMN.  These two numbers can be linked together at UMN and at your site, but only the site knows who you are.  These numbers will not be part of any data that is shared as described above.  
 This study has a Certificate of Confidentiality from the US Federal government.  This means that UMN cannot share any data it has about you with national, state, or local 
civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other authorities unless you specifically allow us to share it.

What are your rights regarding your data?  
UMN is a public research university, and this study is funded primarily by [CONTACT_30114].  The S tate of Minnesota and the US Federal government require 
UMN to follow regulations and policies that are meant to protect your privacy.  UMN is also required to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), because it processes data obtained fr om European residents.  
 There is no specific independent supervisory authority overseeing the processing of 
data in the US.  Any complaint you might have about the use of your data would be 
made to your national data protection authority.  
 The GDPR gives you additional rights which we would like to inform you about below.  
 Right to Information  
You have the right to know what data about you is being processed.  You can also get a free copy of this data.  
 Right to Correction  
You have the right to correct any  information about you which is incorrect or had 
become incorrect.  
 
Right to Erasure/Anonymization  
The sponsor is required under both EU and US law to retain data from research studies such as this one for many years.  However, you have the right to reques t that your 
personal data be completely anonymized.  This is done by [CONTACT_384630].  This means that no one would ever be able to link the data held by [CONTACT_384631].  
 
Right to Restriction of processing  
Under certain conditions, you have the right to demand processing restrictions, i.e. , the 
data may then only be stored, not processed.  You must apply for this.  Please contact 
[CONTACT_384632].  This right may be limited if the restriction would affect the reliabilit y of the study results.  
 
Right to Data portability  
You have the right to receive the personal data that you have provided to the study center.  This will allow you to request that this information be transmitted either to you or, where technically possibl e, to another agency designated by [CONTACT_10825].

4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
The hallmark  signs of aging in the mid- face are often characterized by [CONTACT_357566], loss of tissue volume and body mass, and redistribution of fat tissues. 
Overtime, they result in the formation of deep wrinkles, folds, sagging skin, and hollowing.[ADDRESS_446188]  popular non -invasive aesthetic treatments for mid- face volume restoration is the use 
of hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers.  Due to their safety, effectiveness, and reversibility by [CONTACT_357567],  
HA fillers can help correct facial wrinkles  and folds , while improving facial contour and volume  
augmentation.1-[ADDRESS_446189] been approved for the midface 
volume restoration. Among them are two well -known fillers : Restylane® Contour (Galderma, 
Uppsala, Sweden) and Juvéderm® Voluma® ([COMPANY_013]/Allergan Aesthetics, Irvine, CA ). They each 
contain 20mg/mL of hyaluronic acid with different crosslinking gel technologies, resulting in varying biophysical properties. Restylane® Contour has moderate lifting capacity  (G’) and  
flexibility  whereas Juvéderm ® Voluma® has a higher lifting capacity (G’) and low flexibility.  
The mechanism that each HA filler integrates into the skin tissue reflects the overall appearance 
of the midface . This study is to investigate how the two HA fillers  behave in the skin tissue using 
ultrasound.

9. STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
All images taken from the study will be saved and shared to the Sponsor via a data -protected 
platform . 
9.1 Clinical Photography  (VISIA)  
Digital images of the subject’s face will be taken at baseline (pre -injection) , week 4 (pre -touch 
up), and week 24.  
Clinic staff needs to ensure subjects to have a clean face with no makeup and to remove any 
jewelry from the area to be photographed. Subjects will be provided with a headband to keep 
hair away from the face . Subjects will be instructed to adopt neutral expression (3/4 left, front, 
3/4 right) , closed -mouth smile (3/4 left, front, 3/4 right),  and open -mouth maximum smiling 
expression (3/4 left, front, 3/4 right)  for each photograph.  
A total of [ADDRESS_446200]’s face using the VIS IA CR 
photo- station (Canfield Imaging Systems, Fairfield, New Jersey) with a Canon digital SLR 
camera (manufacture name, location) under the standard lighting condition.  
9.2 Clinical Photography  (Vectra 3D ) 
Three (3) dimensional images of the subject’s face will be taken at baseline (pre- injection) , week 
4 (pre-touch up) , and week 24.  
Clinic staff needs to ensure subjects to have a clean face with no makeup and to remove any 
jewelry from the area to be photographed. Subjects will be provided wi th a headband to keep 
hair away from the face. Subjects will be instructed to adopt neutral, nonsmiling expression with 
their eyes gently closed, and in a relaxed positioned for each scan.  
Photography will be performed  using the Vectra H2 Imaging system ( Canfield Scientific, Inc., 
Canfield, NJ ). The Vectra H2 utilizes raised flash to provide raked lighting to better capture and 
view skin topography and contours. Its software allows 3D viewing of the images and 
quantitative assessm ent of 3D param eters of the face.  
Change in volume on each cheek will be analyzed by [CONTACT_211488] H2  software  (left and right 
cheek separately) .

Ultrasound measurements will be performed at baseline (pre- injection  and immediately post -
injection), week 4 (pre -touch up),  and week [ADDRESS_446201]’s left and right cheek, at neutral expression and at max imum smiling . The 
placement of the ultrasound probe needs to be at the same location  of the product injection and 
for both visits to ensure consistent assessment.  
Ultrasound measurements will be performed using an 18 MHz GE Venue Fit  or 42 MHz  Vevo ® 
MD ultrasonic transducer interfaced to a system. The probe will have a standard setting of gain, 
depth, and velocity scale to assess placement/depth of f iller, size of filler  aggregates , and 
vascularity  around aggregates . 
9.4 Self-Assessment Questionnaire  
Subjects will complete s elf-assessment questionnaire at week 4 ( day 28 ) and week 24 (day 
168). See Appendix I: Self-assessment questionnaire.  
10. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Data of completing subjects will be included for all statistical analyses.  Descriptive statistical 
summary will be performed including N, mean, median, standard deviations, minimum, and maximum of values at all applicable time points and for both treatments.  
For each study treatment, m ean of the change from baseline will be estimated at applicable 
post-baseline time point. The null hypothesis, that the mean change from  baseline is zero, will 
be tested using methods described in the Statistical Analysis Plan table.  
The following will be calculated and reported for each evaluation parameter at  applicable post -
baseline time point:  
Percent mean change from baseline =  (visit  mean score  – baseline  mean  score )
baseline mean  score x 100  
Percent of subjects  i mproved/worsened =  (number  of subjects  improved /worsened  from  baseline
total number  of subjects x [ADDRESS_446202]-baseline time point, will be tested using methods described in th e Statistical Analysis Plan 
table.

11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Throughout the course of the study, all adverse events will be monitored and reported on an 
adverse event CRF/ eCRF without omitting any requested and known information. When AEs 
occur, the main concern is the safety of the study subjects . At time of the informed consent 
signature, each subject must be given the name [CONTACT_357588].  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, 
the investigator  should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_243932]:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit?”  
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?”  
AEs should be reported for any cl inically relevant change, as determined by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator , in 
concomitant medication(s) that is the result of an untoward (unfavorable and unintended) 
change from baseline in a subject's medical health following exposure to the study treatment.  
Changes f rom baseline in any protocol -specific parameter evaluated during the study are to be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator . In addition, the subject’s responses to any questionnaire utilized 
during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_093] . Any untoward (unf avorable and 
unintended) change from baseline in a protocol -specific parameter or question response that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , is to be reported as an AE. These clinically 
relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1.  Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject taking part in 
the clinical study, and which does not necessarily require a causal relationship with the 
investigational product a nd/or a clinical trial procedure.  
An AE can be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigational product, whether 
or not related to this product.  
When an AE has a likely or very likely causal relationship with the investigational product and/or 
a clinical trial procedure, it is named undesirable effect or related AE (see Section 3).  
11.1.2.  Local tolerability signs and symptoms (only applicable for cosmetic safety studies)  
In cosmetic studies, local skin tolerability includes some expected functional and/or physical 
signs on the application area, observed by [CONTACT_357578] (see 
Appendix). Those signs are collected in t he final report based on scales or a diary. If the 
severity of a local skin tolerability sign or symptom, is such that the product application is

Protocol GLI.04. US.SL .015 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Version 2 :  
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
permanently discontinued and/or a corrective concomitant treatment (except moisturizer or 
emollient) is prescribed, it is recorded as an undesirable effect (related AE).  
11.1.3.  Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  and serious undesirable effect/related SAE  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse event which results in death, is life -threatening, 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent 
or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Notes:  
The term “immediate vital risk” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at  the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77231] a night 
at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357562] a diagnostic test (even if related to an 
AE), elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357563], admission to a day -care facility, social admission (e.g., if the subject has no 
place to sleep), or administrative admission (e.g., for a yearly examination) should not be considered as a SAE.  
A serious undesirable effect/related SAE is defined as any SAE which the Investigator classifies 
as having a reasonable possibility for a causal relationship with the investigational product 
and/or the clinical trial procedure.  
11.2 Severity Assessment  
For all AEs occurring during the clinical trial, the Investigator is to classify and report the intensity of AEs using the following definitions as a guideline:  
- Mild: awareness of signs and symptoms, but easily tolerated  
- Moderate: discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
- Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform usual activity. 
11.3 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator is to assess the causal relationship (causality) between an adverse event and 
the investigational product and/or the clinical trial procedure according to the following definitions 
(Decision of 25 November 2013 on Guideline on Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 
(2013/674/EU) - Causality assessment of undesirable effect caused by [CONTACT_357579]):  
• Very likely  
• Likely  
• Not clearly attributable  
• Unlikely  
• Excluded 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors including the pattern of reaction, temporal relationships, positive de -challenge or re -challenge, 
relevant medical history, and confounding factors such as co -medication or concurrent diseases.

11.4 Collection, M anagement and Reporting Procedures 
The period of collection of adverse events starts from the time of signature [CONTACT_357589] (ICF) by [CONTACT_423] (and/or, for subjects who are minor, by [CONTACT_7903]/legal 
representatives)  until the end of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  
If a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is on -going at the final clinical trial visit, it should be followed by 
[CONTACT_357580] a stable condition.  
After the subject completes the clinical study, the Investigator should also inform the Sponsor (see Sponsor’s contact [CONTACT_2212]) if he/she becomes aware of an SAE involving a subject 
who has participated in the clinical study.  
At each post -enrollment visit, the Investigator wil l question the subject about AEs using an open 
non-persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs, for example “ Have you noticed any change in 
your health since the last visit? ” Direct questioning and examination will be performed when 
appropriate.  
The Investigator will obtain and maintain in the subject’s files all pertinent medical records, and (if 
applicable) information and medical judgment from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and 
follow- up of the subject.  If necessary, the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_423]’s personal physician 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99391].  
As a minimum, Investigators are requested to report in the Case Report Form (CRF) and in the report all related adverse events (i.e. undesirable effects) and all Serious Adverse 
Events, whether related or not.  
11.4.1.  Management and reporting procedures for undesirable effects (i.e. related adverse events  
Undesirable effects should be recorded in the CRF and summarized in the report in a summary table with at minimum the subject number, AE number, AE diagnosis or signs and symptoms, 
location, date of onset, seriousness, severity, action taken, relationship, date of resolution and 
concomitant treatment associat ed as well as a detailed narrative of the event.  
In addition, based on his/her medical judgment, the Investigator will assess whether an 
undesirable effect requires immediate (i.e. within 24 hours) reporting to the Sponsor. In such 
cases, the summary table will be sent to the Sponsor, along with the AE narrative and any other 
relevant information (concomitant treatments, product weighing, …).  
All undesirable effects should be appropriately documented, i.e. any relevant information such as 
demographics, medical history and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_357564].  
The Investigator is to monitor and record the progress of the adverse effect until the last subject’s study visit.  
The Investigator is to update the AE narrative as appropriate, each tim e follow- up information is 
collected and when the final outcome of the adverse effect is known. 
11.4.2.  Management and reporting procedures for Serious Adverse Event s  
The Investigator is to take the following steps:  
  Page 20 of 26 
Protocol GLI.04. US.SL .015 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Version 2 :  
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
1. Take prompt and appropriate medical action, if necessary. The safety of clinical trial 
subjects is the first priority  
2. Ensure the AE is classified as an SAE. Immediately inform the Sponsor’s representative of the event by [CONTACT_71345] (see contact [CONTACT_2212]) and discuss further actions to  be 
taken:  
e-mail: [EMAIL_6387]
 
3. Complete the Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form provided by [CONTACT_1034]’s 
representative Within 24 hours, fax or send by e- mail to the Sponsor’s represent ative  
the completed SAE form, accompanied any other relevant information (e.g. test results or medical records).  
4. Monitor, record and send to Sponsor’s representative the progress of the event until it 
resolves or reaches a stable outcome, with or without sequelae (send the updated SAE 
form with follow- up information and any other relevant information to Sponsor’s 
representative).  
5. Obtain and maintain in the subject’s file all pertinent medical records, information, and 
medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject. If necessary, contact [CONTACT_423]’s personal physician or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298423].  
6. If applicable, comply with the regulatory requirement(s) related to the reporting of SAEs to the Ins titutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) . 
11.[ADDRESS_446203] should be 
withdrawn from the clinical study and Sponsor’s representative (see Sponsor’s contact [CONTACT_357581]) should be informed within [ADDRESS_446204] be recorded as a reason for discontinuation in the exit form of the CRF.  
No specific follow- up of pregnancy is required, except if it is a regulatory requirement in the 
country(ies) where the clinical trial is conducted.

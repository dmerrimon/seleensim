[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
November 15, [ADDRESS_431574] now 
being recognized. It is estimated that 10 to 30 percent of people diagnosed with COVID -19 experience 
prolonged illness beyond three weeks (Greenhalgh, Aug 2020) and roughly 1.5 percent are affected for 
3 months or m ore (Sleat, 2020). A recent study reported that two -thirds of patients with mild to 
moderate COVID -19 had persistent symptoms two months after symptom onset. (Carvalho -Schneider, 
2020) Considering that more than [ADDRESS_431575] even people who were never hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. 
(Greenhalgh, Nov 2020). Many of the symptoms are similar to those of chronic fatigue/myalgic 
encephalomyelitis, including fatigue, post -exertional malaise, and brain fog. Treatment for Long Covid 
is mostly supportive, since there are no known  conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347277].  
 The clinical manifestations of Long Covid are varied and each patient can have a constellation 
of different symptoms. In an international online survey of nearly 3,[ADDRESS_431576] frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (98.3 percent), post -exertional 
malaise (89.0 percent) and cognitive dysfunction (88.0 percent). Other common symptoms included 
sleep difficulties (78.6 percent), emotional and mood changes (8 8.3 percent), headaches (77 percent), 
and musculo -skeletal complaints (93.9 percent). (Davis, 2020) Sixty -five percent of respondents 
reported symptoms persisting for more than six months.   
 Homeopathy was first developed in [LOCATION_013] by [CONTACT_347281] 18th century. It 
is based on the principle of similars, whereby [CONTACT_347282].  Homeopathic medi cines are prepared according to standardized methods as specified by [CONTACT_347283] (HPUS), which was mandated by [CONTACT_347284], Drug, and Cosmetics Act  of 
1939.  Most homeopathic products are derived from plant, animal, or mineral sources and because of 
the highly dilute nature of the preparations, are without toxic side effects. The mechanism of action of 
homeopathy is not well understood, but is though t to be due to enhancement of the immune response 
and other auto -regulatory systems of the body. (Bell, 2015)  
 Classical homeopathy,  used widely by [CONTACT_347285], 
involves a [ADDRESS_431577] shown classical homeopathy to be superior to placebo in treating 
a wide variety of illnesses (Mathie, 2014), including chronic diseases with symptoms similar to long 
COVID, such as fibromyalgia (Bell, 2004) and chronic fatigue syndrome (Weatherley -Jones, 2002). 
Because homeopathy is a sys tem that treats the whole person, taking into account physical, emotional, 
and mental symptoms, it is likely to be of particular value to people suffering from the myriad 
symptoms associated with Post -acute COVID -19 Syndrome.  
   
Hypothesis/Purpose  
Our ultimate goal is to determine whether an individually prescribed homeopathic medicine has 
an effect greater than a placebo and is a viable treatment option to improve fatigue and quality of life 
for patients suffering from the sympto ms of Post -acute COVID -[ADDRESS_431578] a full -
scale trial successfully.  Expected results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_347278] a larger clinical trial of this hypothesis.  
 
Technical Objectives  
Our objectives for the study are to: 1) identify efficient means of recruiting subjects, 2) test and 
refine our initial study design and treatment protocol, 3) evaluate the instruments for assessing 
treatment outcomes, 4) estimate sample sizes that will be required in the full -scale trial, 5) determine 
which homeopathic medicines are most often prescribed for this syndrome, and 6) determine whether 
there is a measurable effect size difference or positive trend in reduction of symptoms in patients 
treated with homeopathy.  
 
Methods  
Overview:   In this double -blind pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], [ADDRESS_431579] -
acute COVID -19 syndrome will be randomized to one of tw o treatment arms: classical homeopathy or 
placebo.  Treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_347286], who will see the patients at 
4 week intervals over the course of 12 weeks.  Fatigue scores and general health status as measured by 
[CONTACT_20763] -36 will be measured at entry to the study and at 4 week intervals for 12 weeks.  The MYMOP 
score of specific symptoms will be administered at entry to the study and at the end of 12 weeks.  
Recruitment:  Subjects will be recruited from advertisements on Face book. We hope to enroll [ADDRESS_431580] College of Naturopathic Medicine Human 
Subjects Committee.  Baseline questionnaire data will be collected, including the Fatigue Ass essment 
scale (FAS), the SF -36 quality of life survey, and the Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile 
(MYMOP).    
Eligibility:   Patients entered into the study will be ages [ADDRESS_431581] also be willing to fill out regular questionnaires and to use homeopathic medications.  
Exclusions:   Patients taking steroids, immunosuppressiv es, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_347279]/or are undergoing treatment for substance abuse will be excluded 
from the study.  Patients who were treated in an Intensive Care Unit for Covid -[ADDRESS_431582] two months.  
Treatment:    At the initial visit via video conferencing, a licensed homeopathic practitioner (MD, 
DO, ND, PA, NP) will conduct a thorou gh homeopathic evaluation and determine the specific 
homeopathic medication that seems best suited for each subject.  Homeopathic practitioners will have a 
minimum of five years in practice and be members of a professional homeopathic organization. 
Because  of the individualized nature of classical homeopathic treatment, the usual paradigm of a 
clinical trial whereby [CONTACT_347287].  Instead, the method of 
classical homeopathic treatment as practiced in the real wor ld will be evaluated, with one specific 
medicine prescribed for each patient at the initial visit. Medicines prescribed must be listed in the 
Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the [LOCATION_002] (HPUS). The homeopathic dosage and repetition of 
doses will be chos en by [CONTACT_347288]. 
Practitioners will be able to change the homeopathic medicine as needed during the course of the trial, 
in the same way they would in their usual practice.  
 The homeopathic pres cription will be communicated to a homeopathic pharmacist, who will use 
a randomization scheme prepared by a third party for the patients to receive either the individualized 
medicine or a placebo, both of which will be identical in taste, appearance, odor , and packaging. Study 
medications will be express mailed to subjects’ home addresses in packages that do not reveal personal 
information about the subject, along with dosage instructions.  Existing conventional and integrative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347280], add, or remove any treatment unless recommended by [CONTACT_347289](s).  
Randomization and blinding:   Subjects in the study will be rand omly assigned to receive 
individualized homeopathic treatment or placebo (1 : 1).  After the confirmation of eligibility, subjects 
will be randomized with concealment. Every subject will be assigned with a number and a third party 
will randomize the subjec ts to each of the 2 study groups using computer generated random numbers. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (< or > 50) and duration of Long Covid symptoms (< or > 6 
months), in permuted blocks of four or six. Randomization will be known only to the homeopathic 
pharmacist, who will not break the code until after treatment of each subject is completed.  An 
exception to this will be when a research subject suffers an unexplained severe event. In such a case, 
the randomization code will be broken and the  subject withdrawn from the study.  
Follow -up:  Subjects will have follow -up visits by [CONTACT_347290] 4, 8, 
and [ADDRESS_431583] and mailed to the subjects.  
Although the specific homeopathic prescription might change, sub jects randomized to each group will 
continue to receive placebo or active medicines throughout the study.   
The subjects will also complete online questionnaires at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the initial visit to 
evaluate outcomes.  At the end of the 12 week study period, those subjects who received placebo will 
be given the option to receive a verum homeopathic medicine and an additional follow -up visit after 6 
weeks will be scheduled for them.  
Outcomes:    
The primary outcome measurements:  
• Fatigue Assessment  Score (FAS) at baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12  
• General health status, using the SF -36 at baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12  
       Secondary outcome measurements:  
• Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile (MYMOP), in which each patient chooses the  two 
most bothersome symptoms to record and follow (at study entry and at the end of 12 weeks)  
• The number of subjects who have  FAS ≤21 will be compared at week 4  
Analysis:   Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] a small sample size, statistical tests are unli kely to 
reveal any statistically significant differences.  However, the data will be summarized and analyzed as 
if this were a full -scale trial in an intention to treat analysis by [CONTACT_4305].   
• Demographic data and baseline features will be compared using independent sample t -test and 
chi-square test for continuous and categorical variables respectively. (Age, sex, duration of 
symptoms, co -morbidities)  
• Missing values will be handled by [CONTACT_347291].  
• The Fatigue assessment scale (FAS) and the SF -36 (8 domains) from baseline (Day=0) and at 4 -
, 8-, and 12 -week follow up will be analyzed by [CONTACT_491] -measure analysis of variance 
(treatment x time interaction).   
• The Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile (MYMOP) collected at baseline and at week 
[ADDRESS_431584] if not.  
• The proportion of subjects who ‘return to normal’ (ie have FAS ≤21) will be  compared at week 
[ADDRESS_431585].  
• Analyses will be performed using SPSS software, version 26. Two -tailed P < 0.05 will be used 
to denote statistical significance.  
• Evidence of non -significant trends will be noted, and the variability of the FAS wil l be used for 
sample size estimation for the full -scale trial.  
 
All modifications to this study will be approved by [CONTACT_171508].  Any adverse 
event that occurs temporally related to participation in the study will be documented, whether o r not it 
is considered to be related to the homeopathic medicines.  Serious and unexpected adverse experiences 
will be immediately reported by [CONTACT_347292].

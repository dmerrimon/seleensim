Protocol #:  CTP-0036   , Version 09  Effective Date: 14 Apr 2020   Random assignment will be used to obtain sufficient numbers 
of subjects for each shift of the day 1 accuracy visit (hours 1-8vs. hours 9-[ADDRESS_826084] CGM glucose value) 
and for the timing of the Visit 4 accuracy assessment (day 7 or 14). Each randomization (2 total, with 3 conditions for day 1 and 2 conditions for days 7/14) will be independent. Randomization is only intended to ensure adequate numbers of subjects within conditions and is not intended to form the basis for formal statistical comparisons. 
Visit Schedule:
!Screening Visit (Visit 1). Following informed consent
process, screening evaluation will determine subjecteligibility for enrollment. Visit lasts approximately 2hours. Visit includes screening medical and diabeteshistory, examination and laboratory assessments. Baseline blood draw for HbA1c and Quality of Life Questionnaire will be done. At this visit subjects w ill be 
randomized to determine the subsequent follow-up 
visit schedule.
!Day 0 (+0-45 days from screening) Sensor Insertion
Visit (Visit 2). Sensors will   be inserted by [CONTACT_620709].   Subjects  will receive one sensor or
two sensors (one in each arm). In two sensor subjects,one sensor will be designated the secondary system and will not require calibration. This system will have the ability to collect and log data only and will not display 
glucose.  Subject receives training on study and
devices.

In spi[INVESTIGATOR_620685] , diabetes mellitus continues to be a difficult
medical condition to treat. The challenge remains to achieve desired glycemic control andto prevent both the short-term consequenc es (severe hypoglycemia and DKA) and long-
term complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular problems).
The monitoring of blood glucose by [CONTACT_620715]-care. The current standard gl ucose monitoring regimen for patients with
diabetes involves using a small portable meter to obtain a capi[INVESTIGATOR_620686] a day. According to the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), “successful application of intensified diabetes management
with multiple injection therapy or insulin infusion therapy requires frequent self-
monitoring of blood glucose (four to six times a day) and regular, frequent review of the results to identify patterns requiring adjustment to the diabetes treatment plan.”
1Despi[INVESTIGATOR_620687], due to the nature of diabetesglucose values may fluctuate widely throughout the day. In addition, as the BG meter value
shows only a point in time glucose level, even patients who monitor frequently, may miss
significant hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic excursions. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which measures interstitial glucos e levels, has been developed recently and has
been shown to be associated with improved glycemic control in adults with type 1diabetes. Current commercially available CGM devices require the repeated, frequent
insertion of a sensor by [CONTACT_102].
Senseonics, Inc. a medical device manufacturer headquartered in Germantown, Maryland,
[LOCATION_003], is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new CGM System  inte nded for measuring interstitial fluid glucose
levels in adults with diabetes mellitus. The Eversense® 180 CGM System measures glucoselevels every 5 minutes and is implanted under the skin by a trained health care professional 
(HCP). Unlike commercially available transcutaneous continuous glucose monitoringdevices with short operating lives (up to 14 days), the Eversense® 180 Sensor is intended to be inserted subcutaneously with no sensor part protruding from the skin, and the 
operating life is intended to be up to 180 days or until the end of life indicator is reached.
This clinical trial is being carried out to assess the safety and efficacy of the Eversense® 180

Protocol #:  CTP-0036   , Version 09  Effective Date: 14 Apr 2020   1.1 NAMES, INTENDED USE, AND DESCRIPTION OF STUDY DEVICE
The study investigational Device is the Eversense® 180 CGM System (“System”). The
Eversense® 180 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is a glucose monitoring deviceintended to measure interstitial fluid glucose levels every 5 minutes in individuals withdiabetes for the operating life of the sens or. The Eversense® 180 Continuous Glucose
Monitoring System is intended to be used:
!To provide real-time glucose readings directly to the user
!To provide glucose trend information
!To provide alerts for the detection and prediction of epi[INVESTIGATOR_620688] (hypoglycemia) and high blood glucose (hyperglycemia).
The Eversense® 180 CGM System consists of:
1. Glucose Sensor, (approximately 3.5 mm [0. 138”] diameter x 18.3 mm [0.720”] length) 
which has a ring that elutes the steroid dexamethasone, primary and secondary (in 
subjects with 2 sensors) 
2. Battery-powered external Transmitters (“Transmitter”, primary and secondary (in 
subjects with 2 sensors)
3.Mobile Medical Application (MMA) for display of glucose information that runs on
a Handheld Device (HHD).     
Confidential
Senseonics, Inc. Confidential Information Page 20 of 94
Protocol #:  CTP-0036   , Version 09  Effective Date: 14 Apr 2020   Accessories to the system include:
1. Adhesive Patch: To secure the Transmitter over the Sensor
2.Insertion tool (Blunt dissector, Sensor Inserter): To place the Sensor into the 
subcutaneous space.
3.Charger and Charging Cradle: To charge the Transmitter.
The use of the Eversense® 180 system in this clinical study is outside the current 
commercial indications for use.
1.1.1 DESCRIPTION
The Sensor uses a selective, fully reversible binding between glucose and a uniquefluorescent indicator macromolecule that is grafted on the surface of the Sensor. The
fundamental recognition reaction is a reversible condensation of the cis-diol groups of 
glucose with the bis-boronate moiety of an indicator. Glucose binding by [CONTACT_620716]. Glucose signaltransduction is accomplished by [CONTACT_620717]’s optical system.
The System Transmitter powers the Sensor an d receives signals from the Sensor across
the skin. The Sensor does not contain a battery or other stored power source; instead

Confidential
Senseonics, Inc. Confidential Information Page 21 of 94
Protocol #:  CTP-0036   , Version 09  Effective Date: 14 Apr 2020   it is powered discretely, as needed, by a simple inductive magnetic link between the
Transmitter and Sensor. Signals carrying glucose concentration data are superimposed
upon the magnetic power link between the two components. This results in “passive”
telemetry, rather than an “active” radio frequency (RF) transmission, between the Sensor and Transmitter. Between readings, the Sensor remains electrically dormantand fully powered down. At each query (automatically set for approximately every five minutes, with a duration of approximate ly 100 milliseconds), the Transmitter sends
power (via magnetic link) to activate the sensor, and then uses this same magnetic link
to capture the reading. Finally, the Transmitter calculates and stores the measured
glucose value for transmission to the Mobile Medical Application.
Components of the Eversense® 180 CGM System are traced by [CONTACT_620718]/or lot
number. The Sensor, Sensor holder, insertion tool, and blunt dissector are providedsterile. Sterilized components also have an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]. The device is labeled in
compliance with regulatory language requirements identifying it as investigational. The
Instructions for Use are provided with each shipment.
Insertion of the Sensor is a minimally invasive procedure and clinical investigators 
representing the intended use population (Endocrinologists, Internists, General and Family Practitioners and their medical staff) will be appropriately trained in theprocedure prior to insertion or removal of the Sensor. Training and qualifications of 
investigators will be documented.
Transmitters will be provided for single-subject use in this clinical trial.
1.1.2 CALIBRATION
The primary Eversense® 180 CGM System will be calibrated by [CONTACT_620719]® 180 CGM User Guide, using the study-provided, commercially available
BG Meter (Subject SMBG Meter), according to the SMBG meter manufacturer
instructions. The calibration process automatically moves through three phases: WarmUp, Initialization, and Daily Calibration:
!Warm Up is the first 24 hours after Sensor insertion. During this period, Glucose 
information is not calculated. No calibration is performed.
!Initialization can be performed a minimum of 24 hours after Sensor insertion.
Following the WarmUp phase, the entering of four successful calibration BG readingswithin 24 hours is required for successful completion of Initialization. Glucose 
information will begin to be calculated after the second calibration is enteredsuccessfully.

Senseonics, Inc. Confidential Information Page 22 of 94
Protocol #:  CTP-0036   , Version 09  Effective Date: 14 Apr 2020   !Daily Calibration requires a minimum of 2 calibration per day.
The secondary Eversense® [ADDRESS_826099] 2015 and Senseonics received CE Mark in May 2016; two U.S. pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (PRECISE II, completed in July 2016 and PRECISION, completed in February 2018) were also completed and FDA approval was received in June 2018. These studies demonstrated that the Eversense® 180 CGM System provided reliable glucose readings for periods of up to 
approximately 180 days when compared to laboratory blood glucose analyzer 
measurements, with no notable safety issues.

4.3.1 THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES/INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE FOLLOWED FOR ALL ACCURACY 
VISITS
[IP_ADDRESS] PRE-VISIT PHONE CALL (DAY 7-180 VISITS)
Approximately [ADDRESS_826135] is in compliance with study device wear prior to the scheduled start of glucose sampling.   Subjects may be instructed to calibrate at a specific number of hours before the scheduled visit start in order to assess accuracy over the entire 
calibration window. Subjects may also be given appropriate instructions regarding pre-
visit medications and meals.
[IP_ADDRESS] SUBJECT INSTRUCTIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION
Prior to admission, subjects should take morning medications as usual as follows:
!If challenge subjects need to eat or take insulin for safety reasons, they should inform 
study staff of this information on arrival to the clinic.
!Subjects should consume the food they would normally consume to treat or prevent 
hypoglycemia at the blood glucose level they feel is appropriate.
A clinician trained in the treatment of diabetes should also discuss and make 
recommendations about each subject’s insulin regimen for the remainder of the day to 
prevent post-visit rebound hypoglycemia which can occur 12 hours later.
[IP_ADDRESS] DEVICE SET UP

4.3.8 USE OF STUDY DEVICES FOR DIABETES TREATMENT
For the duration of the study, all diabetes care decisions will be based on reference blood glucose values or SMBG as appropriate, rather than Eversense® 180 CGM System results.
4.3.9 IV/BLOOD DRAW GUIDELINES
[IP_ADDRESS] IV PLACEMENT/SETUP
IVs for blood sampling may be placed in the arm or hand. IV Access will be maintained 
during the sampling portion of the study for blood sampling and for the treatment of 
severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia during the study. If an IV fails, a reasonable effort should be made to replace it.
It is advised that sites use a heating pad in order to help keep IV sampling sites patent and 
improve blood flow.
Confidential
Senseonics, Inc. Confidential Information Page 43 of 94
Protocol #:  CTP-0036   , Version 09  Effective Date: 14 Apr 2020   [IP_ADDRESS] TIMING OF BLOOD SAMPLING
Blood will be sampled approximately every 5 to 15 minutes, dependent on the value of 
the previous sample according to the following ranges:
!BG ≥ 3 0 0m g / d L :  e v e r y  5m i n u t e s  ( + / -2m i n u t e s )*
!BG >70 mg/dL and < 300 mg/dL: every 15 minutes (+/- 2 minutes)
!BG ≤70 mg/dL:  every 5 minutes (+/- 2 minutes)
*When > 400 mg/dL, sampling may be reduced to every 15 minutes 
Blood sampling can also be reduced to every 15 minutes after the challenge is met. 
Additional samples may be drawn for YSI glucose analysis as needed for patient safety or 
to recheck a suspected erroneous value (e.g. dilute sample).
In the event of loss of IV access or loss of functional YSI and need for continued subject 
monitoring, glucose measurements will be made on capi[INVESTIGATOR_305494]. 
Samples missed due to loss of IV access or other interruptions will not be considered 
protocol deviations.   
[IP_ADDRESS] SAMPLE VOLUME
Approximately 0.5 ml IV blood samples will be collected (after 1.5 ml waste is cleared from sampling apparatus) in sample containers with an appropriate anticoagulant additive (BD Microtainer K2E tubes (REF 365955) or Sarstedt Monovette with K2E (REF 
06.1664.001) or similar) for analysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] CENTRIFUGE
Centrifuge sample to sufficiently separate the plasma, approximately 30 seconds in 
StatSpin Express 2 (or similar) centrifuge (8500 rpm).
Samples centrifugation should begin as soon as possible after the blood draw (within a 
maximum of 3 minutes).   Samples should be discarded if not run within this time frame.
4.3.10 GLUCOSE CHALLENGES
[IP_ADDRESS] SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY 
Subjects not on insulin therapy will not be expected to undergo hypoglycemic challenges.  Eligible subjects will be required to participate in glucose challenges. Subjects unable to participate in glucose challenges will participate in the accuracy sessions using free range glucose control.
Confidential
Senseonics, Inc. Confidential Information Page 44 of 94
Protocol #:  CTP-0036   , Version 09  Effective Date: 14 Apr 2020   [IP_ADDRESS] GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING WHICH CHALLENGE TO CHOOSE (ALL VISITS)
Subject BG levels and direction of those levels determined using the first three SMBG/YSI 
readings will inform whether the subject will participate in the hypoglycemia or 
hyperglycemia challenge on that study day, according to the following table as a guideline:
Glucose level Challenge*
<180 mg/dL Hypoglycemia challenge
≥180 mg/dL Hyperglycemia challenge
*Investigator discretion and patient safety will also be considered 
in determining appropriate challenge. Additional SMBG can be done to determine the appropriate challenge.
[IP_ADDRESS] INITIATING THE GLUCOSE CHALLENGE
Hyperglycemia challenges may be initiated by [CONTACT_17801] a mixed meal of (30 to 40%)carbohydrate content gradually targeting maintaining a glucose level of >300 mg/dL for [ADDRESS_826143]’s insulin/carbohydrate ratio. Liquid carbohydrates (such as 
Boost, soda, juice) can be given in small volumes only if the mixed meal is not successful 
in reaching the target.  Hypoglycemia challenges may be initiated by [CONTACT_620726]-acting insulin targeting maintaining <70 mg/dL for [ADDRESS_826144]’s insulin sensitivity ratio. Details about all carbohydrates (time, type and amount) will be recorded for entry into the study database, as well as all bolus insulin given.
4.3.[ADDRESS_826145] SMBG meter and the Transmitter(s) will be downloaded at the 
end of each sensor accuracy visit (Days 1-180 visits), during each clinic visit for subjects in 
the cohort continuing to 365 days, or at any unscheduled visit as appropriate. Transmitter data will also be uploaded to a data management system to monitor calibration compliance. Additionally, for the subjects continuing to 365 days of sensor wear with the secondary sensor and a new primary sensor, accuracy of the new 180 day primary sensor 
will be monitored for performance approxim ately every 2 weeks.  Since the compliance 
monitoring of the daily SMBG entry will continue on for the second primary sensor, the performance monitoring with use entered SMBG points to assess that the accuracy is within the distribution of the 20/20% agreement per day from the PRECISE II studythroughout that two week monitoring interval. If  performance is not restored to within 
the PRECISE II distribution within 2 weeks, the 180-day sensor will be placed in blinded

4.3.12 HbA1c BLOOD DRAW
Blood samples will be drawn for HbA1c measurement at the 90-day, 180-day, and 
365-day visits, as applicable. All samples will be collected and processed as 
described in the instructions provided by [CONTACT_6626].
4.3.13 QUESTIONNAIRES
At visits 8 (Day 90 visit), 11 (Day 180 visit), and 15 (Day 365 visit) subjects will complete the Diabetes Distress Scale questionnaire. At the removal visit, subjects will complete the CGM Satisfaction questionnaire. Subjects who have a sensor enter Clinical Mode prior to the designated visits, the Diabetes Distress Scale 
questionnaire and CGM Satisfaction questionnaire may be completed at the visit 
following confirmation of Clinical mode.
4.3.14 DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS – SENSOR ACCURACY VISITS
The discharge procedure will occur upon completion of visit related activities. Blood glucose (either SMBG or YSI) and ketone measurements will be assessed. If the glucose level is <75 mg/dL or >300 mg/dL, corrective action will be taken by [CONTACT_093].Subjects may be discharged when they have had [ADDRESS_826147] 15 
minutes apart that are >75 and < 300 mg/dL. Ketones should be ≤1.5mmol/L. Site will 
document any adverse events that may have occurred during the visit.
Additional inpatient time for BG stabilization will not be considered an adverse event or 
protocol deviation.
Subjects will be provided a standard meal or snack as necessary prior to release to 
prevent post-discharge hypoglycemia. Snacks will be available in the clinic for subjects to take with them on the ride home.
A clinician trained in the treatment of diabetes should also discuss and make 
recommendations about each subject’s insulin regimen for the remainder of the day to prevent post-visit rebound hypoglycemia which can occur 12 hours later.
4.3.15 ESTIMATED TOTAL BLOOD VOLUME
Approximately 43-51 blood samples will be obtained throughout the course of each of 
the respective visits in addition to the blood samples (2 ml) required for HbA1c analysis
(as required) and fingersticks. The estimated amount of blood for each accuracy visit is approximately 2 ml per sample, exclusive of lab draws.

maintenance will be followed.
5.2.[ADDRESS_826152] SMBG METER
The study will supply and use a widely-used, commercially available FDA-approved self-
monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) meter and strips. Control solution testing of the 
meter/strips will be verified with the control solution(s) specific to the meter and strips. The tested control solutions must read within the established range on the glucometer strips per manufacturer labeling in order to be used in the study. Manufacturer instructions for operation and quality control will be followed. Subjects will be advised to 
perform control solution testing each time a new package of strips is deployed, or any 
time the subject suspects improper performance of the meter.
5.2.3 KETONE METER
The study will supply and use an FDA-approved self-monitoring ketone meter and strips (Abbott Precision Xtra or similar), which will measure β-hydroxybutyrate ( β-HOB). Ketone 
meters will remain at the clinical site (not disbursed to the subject). Calibration of the ketone meter will be verified with the control solution(s) specific to the meter and strips. 
The tested control solutions must read within the established range on the strips per 
manufacturer labeling in order to be used in the study. Manufacturer instructions for operation and quality control will be followed.
5.3 SENSOR REPLACEMENT
Primary sensors that fail within 30 days of sensor insertion will be replaced at an unscheduled visit.  Subjects will continue to follow their originally scheduled visits. 
5.4 PRIMARY SENSOR BLINDING
During the study the primary system may go into a “blinded mode” (called Clinical Mode by [CONTACT_8121]). Under these circumstances subjects will continue to wear the system, and enter calibrations (as prompted) and SMBG values, but the system will not provide sensor 
glucose information or glucose related alerts. Subjects should continue with all remaining 
sensor accuracy visits with the blinded system. 
If a primary sensor displays a “sensor replacement” alert, it (and the secondary sensor if 
applicable) will be removed at an unscheduled visit, and the subject will be withdrawn.

10.1 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND CASE REPORT FORMS
The investigator or his/her designee at each site is responsible for recording
investigation-related data onto the CRFs and maintain source documentation supporting
the data. Good Clinical Practice in the documentation on source documents and CRFswill be followed. For source documentation or if papers CRFs are used, the data must be
legibly written in ink. If changes are required, a single line is to be drawn through the
incorrect information, the correct information written in and the change initialed anddated by [CONTACT_121754]. The reason for correction may be noted,unless obvious. Pencil, correction fluid or correction tape must not be used, andincorrect information must not be obscured (scribbled-out).
The investigator must review, sign, and date the CRFs as indicated on the form or
electronically; these responsibilities cannot be delegated to another person. It is theinvestigator’s responsibility to comply with regulatory requirements including, but notlimited to, the maintenance of accurate, complete and current records relating to the CRFs.
The Sponsor (or their designee) will review t he data against the original source
documents and ensure any noted discrepancies are resolved by [CONTACT_2727].
Subject data will be compared to information originally recorded on source documents
related to the trial (i.e. professional notes, laboratory reports, investigation-specificworksheets, etc.).
Investigation-related information collect ed on CRFs will be entered into a secure
database. The database design and installation will be validated prior to use.

10.2 GLUCOSE MEASUREMENT DATA FLOW PROCESS
10.2.1 TRANSMITTER DATA LOGGING
The Transmitter is a rechargeable, external device worn over the Sensor insertion site
that supplies power to the Sensor. The Transmitter periodically (usually every 5minutes) reads sensor data and calculates sensor glucose and trends. The informationfrom the Transmitter is then transmitted for display to a handheld device (e.g.Smartphone) via Bluetooth Low Energy with AES-CCM encryption. At any one time, the Transmitter contains all of the data collected since last erasure, extending back in time
to the limit of its capacity. Each Sensor reading is recorded with a timestamp. Successive 
uploads from a subject’s assigned Transmitte r can be assembled into a cumulative time
profile, using these timestamps.
10.2.[ADDRESS_826177] Assigned Transmitters will be collected at clinic visits. The data will
be downloaded by a data communication device running Senseonics’ custom softwareapplication and saved to a file. The file will be uploaded to a 21CFR11 compliant record,utilizing a 21CFR11- compliant third-party software application.
Confidential
Senseonics, Inc. Confidential Information Page 69 of 94
Protocol #:  CTP-0036   , Version 09  Effective Date: 14 Apr 2020   The Senseonics’ software application will identify the Sensor serial number and ask the 
user to enter the site ID, subject ID and visit number. The file name [CONTACT_620756] t ime. Transmitter data will also be 
uploaded to a data management system to monitor calibration compliance.

10.2.5 DATA RETENTION
During and/or at the conclusion of the investigation, original data from the laptop at theclinical site will be transferred to a 21CFR11-compliant electronic record system. The 
clinical site will be provided a master CD/USB of the electronic data to meet record 
retention requirements.
11 STATISTICAL METHODS
11.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OVERVIEW
11.1.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
The statistical analysis of the data is focused on assessing performance via downloads and data from the clinic including the Fingerstick Blood Glucose Meter Data (Subject SMBG), the YSI Reference Glucose Data, the Eversense® 180 CGM System Data, and other manual 
Confidential
Senseonics, Inc. Confidential Information Page 70 of 94
Protocol #:  CTP-0036   , Version 09  Effective Date: 14 Apr 2020   entries (e.g. Implant Time, Subject Number). Descriptive statistics will be used to 
summarize all subject Baseline and outcome data collected during the study.  Continuous 
variables will be summarized using means, standard deviations, and ranges.  Categorical 
variables will be summarized in frequency distributions.
Statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_305566] (e.g., MATLAB and SAS® 9.4).  
Adequate source document verification and/or audit activities will be utilized to assess the validity of investigation conclusions.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_620702].
11.1.2 DATA POOLING 
Subjects will be selected consecutively (i.e., selecting every subject in the order they present at the site) among those who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  All subjects will receive sensors and transmitters.  The primary effectiveness measure (MARD) will be analyzed with data pooling across sites.  Site effects will be examined, but only 
descriptively.
Analyses will be performed based on aggregating all patients in the study, and again 
separately for each randomized groups. The analysis by [CONTACT_620741]. Transmitters 
will be designated as primary (lef t arm) and secondary (right arm).
Analyses will be performed for subgroup of interest (based on type of diabetes (type I vs. 
type 2), age ( ≥ 65 years of age vs. < 65), and baseline HbA1c ( ≥8% vs. < 8%).
11.1.3 SENSOR EVALUATION PERIOD
The Eversense® 180 CGM System performance will be evaluated in the period after insertion.  The Transmitter will assess the Sensor’s signal sensitivity in real time for any 
premature failure independent of the expected lifetime based on time from insertion.  If 
the measurement of potential degraded response of the Sensor optical system signal drops below a pre-defined percent of its original value and/or systemic patterns in Sensor accuracy to entered calibration points drops below a pre-defined threshold, then the device has reached it end of life (sensor retirement) and will no longer provide glucose 
readings.  This end of life determination marks the end of the accuracy evaluation period 
for this Sensor.  The distribution of times between Sensor insertion and end of life or completion of scheduled study visits, whichever occurs first will be summarized.

11.3 EFFECTIVENESS ENDPOINTS
11.3.1 SUMMARY
The effectiveness measure will be the mean absolute relative difference (MARD), calculated for all paired Sensor and reference measurements through [ADDRESS_826183]-insertion.  
11.3.2 EFFECTIVENESS MEASURE
[IP_ADDRESS] EFFECTIVENESS MEASURE: CRITERIA
The effectiveness objective is to descriptively document the distribution of absolute relative difference across all evaluable subjects and to estimate the MARD. MARD will be calculated based on all the data through [ADDRESS_826184].  There is no hypothesis to be tested.  No inferential 
statistical analysis will be performed.
The effectiveness measure is the mean absolute relative difference (MARD), defined as 
the average of absolute difference of paired Eversense® 180 CGM System and reference 
glucose readings divided by [CONTACT_305572] (reference) for all reference 
glucose values, that is:  
MARD =   ∑

After the conduct of the study, additional effectiveness analyses will be performed with 
a modified calibration scheme to support 1 calibration per day after Day 21 following 
Sensor insertion (i.e., calibration will be performed twice (2) per day for Days 1-21, followed by [CONTACT_8206] (1) per day for Days 22 until the end of Sensor life).  It is important to note that the raw clinical data that is collected by [CONTACT_620748]. Performing the effectiveness analyses after the collection of Sensor data is analogous to how the effectiveness analyses were 
performed to demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithm change that was included in 
Software 602 (SW602), which was approved in the Eversense CGM System PMA (P160048). A separate statistical analysis plan will be developed for this analysis to evaluate the new calibration frequency.

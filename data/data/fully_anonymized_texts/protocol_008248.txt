PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
Title:  Good Oral Health: A Bi -level Intervention to improve older  adult 
oral health  
 
Précis:  This study will test an intervention designed to change oral 
health norms and reduce disparities in oral health among 
vulnerable adults residing in publicly funded senior housing in 
Central Connecticut. The intervention model is based on 
Fishbein’s modifie d theory of reasoned action operationalized 
through Adapted Motivational Interviewing and Practice -to- 
Mastery (AMI -PM). The intervention includes two  components:  
1) a face to face administration of the AMI -PM, a participatory 
counseling model, and 2) a ta rgeted building -level campaign 
(CA) consisting of up to three half -day oral health events with 
skills development through practice to mastery (PM) to parallel 
the individual intervention (CA+PM), all based on the study’s 
conceptual model. The study uses a modified fractional factorial 
design to evaluate the face to face and campaign components 
separately and in different additive sequences. Six buildings will 
be paired in three dyads. The buildings in each dyad will be 
randomized to either having the AMI -PM intervention first 
followed by [CONTACT_28474]+PM or to having the CA+PM first followed by 
[CONTACT_708394]-PM. Sixty residents will be recruited in each building for a 
total of 360 participants. There will be four assessments:  
 
1) T0 will include a survey, oral hygiene skills assess ment and 
clinical assessment of the Gingival Index and Plaque Score. 
The survey will provide data on the conceptual domains that  are 
the target of the tailored  intervention;  
 
2) T1 will follow the AMI -PM or CA+PM (depending on 
condition) and will include the survey, oral hygiene skills 
assessment and clinical assessment of the Gingival Index and 
Plaque Score. This assessment will occur 1 -3 months after  the 
AMI-PM or  CA+PM;  
 
3) T2 will follow the AMI -PM or CA+PM and will include the 
survey, oral hygiene skills assessment and clinical  assessment 
of the Gingival Index and Plaque Score. This assessment will 
occur 1 -3 months after the AMI -PM or  CA+PM.  
 
4) T3 will include oral hygiene sk ills assessment and clinical 
assessment of the Gingival Index and Plaque Score. This  will

2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND  SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
 
2.[ADDRESS_962895] a high prevalence of  preventable and treatable oral health problems, 
and oral health disparities among impoverished older adults and adults with disabilities 
from all racial/ethnic backgrounds are striking, particularly with respect to African 
Americans and Latinos (Griffin, Jones, Brunson, Griffin, Bailey, 2012). Oral health is 
recognized as related to general health; thus, improving oral health can achieve 
improved overall health, which is critically important for racial/ethnic minority  populations 
who also suffer from dispr oportionate rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The 
development of a low cost intervention, conducted in locations where older and disabled 
adults live, that can develop potentially sustainable normative support for oral health, 
hygiene and chang e specific oral health practices (brushing, flossing, cleaning mouth 
and tongue, etc.) can reduce short and longer term psychosocial and economic costs 
associated with chronic illness and disability. Reducing persistent oral health disparities 
among vulner able low income older adults and adults with disabilities is a central 
objective in Healthy People 2020 ( healthypeople.gov/2020/about/default.aspx ) and is a 
priority of state health de partments and Area Agencies on Aging. Limited knowledge of 
oral health in general and related prevention and treatment alternatives, cultural 
differences in language and perception of oral health problems, and structural barriers 
to care such as insurance gaps, limited personal mobility and transportation, and 
inadequate culturally relevant public health education combine to increase oral health 
disparities in vulnerable populations. In 2009, NIH held its first conference to address 
ways of crafting and eva luating cognitive and behavioral interventions to address these 
issues. The conference specifically emphasized the importance of theoretical framing 
and tailored interventions to meet individual participant  needs.  
 
To address oral health disparities among older adults, a partnership of the University of 
Connecticut School of Dental Medicine, the Institute for community Research and the 
North  Central  Area  Agency  on Aging  developed  and received  funding  for two studies  led 
by [CONTACT_708396]. Together, these projects developed the 
capacity, materials, design and infrastructure for the expansion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], entitled 
“Good Oral Health – A Bi-level Approach to Improve Older Adult Oral  Health ” 
 
Building Collaborative Research Infrastructure to Reduce Oral Health Disparities among 
Low Income Older Adults ( 1 RC4 DE021324) built associations with 15 low income 
senior housing buildings in Meriden (3), Hartford (8) and New Britain (4) through 
contacts with man agement and building committees and presentations. Overall building 
demographics were: 64% - Private; 36% -Public; 52% - Hispanic, 29% - African - 
American/Caribbean, 19% - Non-Hispanic White. The project also allowed us to

develop health education materials, together with building residents based on the notion 
of FAQs. The final FAQs were formatted into a booklet for use in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
Our successful pi[INVESTIGATOR_708353] #R34 DE022271 (2011 -2013) was 
based on Fishbein’s modified theory of reasoned action called Integrated Model (IM) of 
Behavioral Prediction (Fishbein, 2008) operationalized through Adapted Motivational 
Intervi ewing (AMI) and Bandura’s notions of self -efficacy and skills reinforcement 
operationalized through Practice -to-Mastery or PM (Liska, 1984; Connor, 2010). The 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_203727] a single building of approximately [ADDRESS_962896] Area. It included two components offered sequentially, a face to face 
intervention (the AMI) with practice of oral hygiene skills to mastery (PM), and two 
campaign fairs promoted by a small committee of building residents. Post intervention, 
particip ants (n=30) demonstrated a significant improvement in the Plaque Scores from a 
mean score at baseline of 84% (sd=11.8%) to 58% (sd=31.2%) at follow -up (p<0.001) 
and the Gingival Index from a mean baseline score of 1.2 (sd=0.56) to a mean follow -up 
score of  0.54 (sd=0.47), p<0.001. Differences in P -M skills scores from pre to post 
instruction in brushing and flossing, part of the AMI -PM session showed significant 
improvement. Brushing scores increased from 1.9 (fair/poor) prior to the AMI -PM 
session to 2.9 ( good/excellent; p<0.001) after and flossing skills improved from 1.7 to  
2.7 (p<0.001). In the intervention group, we found significant mean decreases 
(improvements) from pre to post in several important cognitive domains including 
perceived risk of oral di sease which decreased from a mean of 2.5 to 2.0 (sd=.70 for 
both, p=.04) self -management worries which decreased from a mean of 1.36 (sd=.66) to  
0.57 (sd=.97); p=.002) and self -management fears which decreased from a mean of 2.2 
(sd=.81) to 1.53 (sd=.97; p =.001). In contrast, non -AMI respondents showed mean  
increases  (deterioration) from pre to post in all three domains.  
 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_708354]. 
The proposed study uses a modified fractional fac torial design (MFFD), a design 
approach developed to maximize capacity and cost effectiveness of testing intervention 
designs with multiple components which are found to be effective, but in which the 
interactivity of the components to produce positive out comes is not well understood 
(Chakraborty, Collins, Strecher, Murphy, 2009; Collins, 2013; Nair, Strecher, Fagerlin, 
Ubel, Resnicow, Murphy, et al. 2008; Collins, Dziak, Li, 2009; Collins, Murphy, Nair, 
Strecher, 2005). Thus, the study is designed to evalu ate the face to face and campaign 
components against each other, and in different additive sequences to determine which 
component has better short term outcomes, and whether sequencing components 
makes a difference in the final outcome.  
 
2.2 Rationale  
A search  of the literature on disparities in geriatric oral health, state reports and local 
agency agendas point to significant gaps and needs to be addressed in this study.  
There are great disparities in oral health of older adults and those with disabilities 
including the high prevalence of decay, periodontal disease, edentulism, unmet

treatment needs and impaired quality of life associated with oral health conditions 
among older adults (Anders & Davis, 2010; Appollonio, Carabellese, Frattola, 
Trabuc chi, 1997; Jensen, Saunders, Thierer, Friedman, 2008; Petersen, Yamamoto, 
2005; Ritchie, Joshipura, Silliman, Miller, Douglas, 2005; Slade, Spencer, Locker, Hunt, 
Strauss, Beck, 1996) and adults with disabilities (Anders & Davis, 2010). Further there 
are s ignificant disparities in burden of oral disease, oral health care, and oral health 
related quality of life by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity, social class, and medical, functional and 
psychological comorbidities (Appollonio, Carabellese, Frattola, Trabucchi, 1997; 
Jensen , Saunders, Thierer, Friedman, 2008; Petersen, Yamamoto, 2005; Ritchie, 
Joshipura,  Silliman,  Miller,  Douglas,  2005;  Slade,  Spencer,  Locker,  Hunt,  Strauss,  Beck, 
1996; Ahluwalia &, Sadowsky, 2003; Ahluwalia, 2004, Lamster & Northridge, 2008; 
Petersen, 1990). Oral health is reciprocally related to systemic health (Kandelman, 
Petersen, Ueda, 2008) and systemic health conditions and physiological declines 
associ ated with aging can, in turn, have deleterious effects on oral health. Improving 
oral health in vulnerable older adults should have a significant impact on the reduction 
of disparities in other systemic health conditions. Oral health disparities affect eth nic 
and ethnic and racial minorities and low income populations and have a greater effect 
on quality of life among older African Americans compared to Whites on every 
dimension, but particularly in psychological discomfort, pain and functional limitations 
(Ahluwalia &, Sadowsky, 2003; Locker & Slade, 1994; Makhija, Gilbert, Boykin, Litaker, 
Allman, Baker, et al. 2006; Sheiham, Steele, Marcenes, Lowe, Finch, Bates, et al., 
2001; Gerdin, Einarson, Jonsson, Aronsson, Johansson, 2005). Improving oral health 
related quality of life should be an important objective of oral health  interventions.  
There are studies that show that significant reductions in plaque and gingivitis can be 
achieved with manual tooth brushing (van der Weijden & Hioe, 2005; Robinson, 
Deacon, Deery, Heanue, Walmsley, Worthington, et al., 2005 Robinson, Deacon, 
Deery, Heanue,  Walmsley, Worthington, et al., 2005 Jönsson, Ohrn, Lindberg, 
Oscarson, 2010;Jönsson, Lindberg, Oscarson, Öhrn; 2006) and one study 
demonstrates the importance of motivational interviewing in achieving these outcomes. 
These studies also provide the basis f or estimating effect sizes for the current 
intervention. However other research indicates that both brushing and knowledge are 
not sufficient to result in long term improvements in oral hygiene. Without good 
behavioral self -management, the effects of clini cal interventions are not persistent 
(Korber, 2006; Ajzen, 1980) and require cognitive -behavioral understanding and 
knowledge, daily attention to oral hygiene, and a pro -oral health environment.  
 
Fishbein’s integrated model of behavioral prediction, the IM  is built on extensive 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_708355]. The 
utility of the IM model in guiding prevention programming is supported by a substantial 
body of literature on factors contributing to improved ora l health and prevention of 
periodontal disease of older adults above and beyond knowledge. These include oral 
health knowledge, locus of control, self -efficacy, social norms, intentionality of action 
and behavioral practice with a trusted role model. To it  we have added an additional 
measure missing in the literature, on fears and concerns about oral health and hygiene  
IRB Review  
IRB NUMBER: 14 -188-6 
IRB APPROV ADL rDafAt T1E.6: 01/03/2019  
12/14/2018  Good Oral Health: A Bi -level Intervention to Improve Older Adult Oral Health 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_962897] developed a new measure of oral health fears through formative  research 
in the study  population.  
 
In addition, the IM model emphasizes the importance of social norms which are widely 
recognized t o influence individual behavior (Cialdini & Trost, 1998). There is no 
research on social norms related to oral health, especially among older adults. Analysis 
of survey data on social supports for oral health information seeking and the results of 
analysis  of the domain content/delivery of the AMI point to lack of social support for 
obtaining oral hygiene information.  
 
Combined with Bandura’s notions of self -efficacy and skills practice (Tedesco, Keffer, 
Fleck -Kandath, 1991; Bandura, 1989) and the additiona l conceptual domains identified 
above, the MI offer a cognitive behavioral approach to understanding and 
operationalizing an intervention to improve oral health self -management behaviors. In 
this study, it will be operationalized at the individual level  through Adapted Motivational 
Interviewing (AMI), a scripted, standardized and measurable motivational interviewing 
approach and Practice -to-Mastery (PM) and at the group level  through participant - 
driven campaigns (CA) with MI driven messages based on domain s in the theoretical 
model (figure 1) and opportunities for Practice -to-Mastery (PM) embedded the 
campaigns.  
 
Recognizing that individual level interventions have limited capacity to sustain change, 
many researchers propose multi -component, multi -level int ervention approaches in 
producing both better immediate outcomes, and higher potential for sustainability 
(Schensul & Trickett, 2009; Trickett, 2009; DiClemente, Salazar, Crosby, 2007; 
Manhart, Holmes, 2005; Sallis, Cervero, Ascher, Henderson, Kraft, Kerr,  2006; van 
Empelen, Kok, van Kesteren, van den Borne, Bos, Schaalma, 2003; Trickett, Beehler, 
Deutsch, Green, Hawe, McLeroy, et al., 2011; Albarracin, Rothman, Di Clemente, del 
Rio, 2010; Albarracin, Tannenbaum, Glasman, Rothman, 2010; Latkin, Weeks, 
Glasm an, Galletly, Albarracin, 2010; Schensul, Radda, Coman, Vazquez, 2009; 
Schensul, Trickett, 2009). Patrick, et al.(2006) are among those who argue for the need 
for multilevel approaches to improve oral health, particularly among ethnic  minorities.  
A multile vel approach that supports and reinforces the same predictors and oral health 
practices both publicly, through resident led activities, and in individually through a 
tailored intervention should maximize outcome effects in a residential social 
environment and pave the way for future sustainability.

interaction of cognitive and behavioral domains in contributing to clinical outcomes. The 
design of the proposed expansion study will allow us to address these limitations.  
 
2.3 Potential Risks and  Benefits  
 
2.3.1  Potential  Risks  
Risks to respondents from participation in this study are minimal. General risks might 
include: a) discomfort in presenting/discussing oral health conditions and behaviors; b) 
negative responses to oral health peer advocate commit tee members by [CONTACT_708397]; c) possible loss of confidentiality if Campaign Committee members reveal any 
personal communications between themselves and residents related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_708359]. These events have not occurred  in previous studies.  
Risks associated with the oral health screening include some discomfort from the 
assessment. If a participant experiences sensitivity to the gum region, the topi[INVESTIGATOR_708360] 20% will be applied with a cotton swab to the c heek and gum 
side of the gum tissue prior to the screening exam. In the event that a dental condition 
discovered during the screening exam requires emergent/urgent evaluation or care, the 
participant will be notified immediately of the findings and will be  referred immediately 
for treatment.  
 
2.3.2  Potential  Benefits  
Individual participants may benefit from the clinical evaluation, and referral for further 
evaluation or treatment for dental, periodontal and soft tissue problems. The subjects 
will be notified of t he findings of the oral health screening during the AMI -PM 
intervention, and any concerns or obstacles to improved oral health self -management 
will be addressed; thus participants may be able to improve their own self -care and 
prevent or reduce plaque accu mulation and gum inflammation. Building residents will 
have the opportunity to reinforce their knowledge and oral health management 
behaviors in three campaigns (fairs) where they can obtain expert consultation for 
specific queries. Residents have the oppo rtunity to play a leadership role in their 
building.

3.2 Study Outcome  Measures  
 
3.2.1  Primary  
The primary outcome measure is the clinical assessment of oral hygiene status:  
 
Plaque Score: We will use a plaque scoring scheme developed by O’Leary (O'Leary, 
Drake, Naylor, 1972). This index consists of dichotomous presence or absence scores 
for plaque on each tooth surface. The supragingival bacterial plaque will be assessed 
with the use of erythrosine disclosing solution in six surfaces of each tooth. The non - 
toxic vegetable -based solution will be applied to the teeth by [CONTACT_708398]. 
The n umber of surfaces stained red will be calculated over the total number of surfaces 
and the plaque score will be expressed as a percentage of surfaces with plaque as a

ratio. We used this measure in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_708361].  
 
Gingival Index: The Gingival Index (GI) (Loe & Silness, 1963) will be used to assess 
the gingival status related to six surfaces of each tooth. Each surface is scored for 
gingival inflammation: 0=no visual signs of inflammation; 1=slight change in color and 
texture of the  gingiva but no bleeding; 2=visual sign of inflammation and bleeding upon 
swipi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; 3=overt inflammation and spontaneous bleeding. The index is calculated by 
[CONTACT_708399] (mean value).  
Individual score s are summed to obtain a mean. Again, we used this measure in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_708362].  
 
3.2.2  Secondary  
Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL): We will use the General (Geriatric)  
Oral Health Assessment Inventory (GOHAI), a commonly used 12 -item measure initially 
developed for older adults that has been used with low income populations (Atchison & 
Dolan, 1990). The GOHAI was translated into Spanish and back translated for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_708363]/ethnic spectrum.  
 
The GOHAI will be administered as part of the survey at T0 through T3. Research staff 
will be trained in administering the GOHAI as part of the general training in 
administering the survey. An objective of the study is to assess how the interventions 
and sequencing of the interventions affect OHRQOL and whether mediators 
differentially affect OHRQOL outcomes. Our primary outcomes are plaque scores and 
gingival index, but we expect tha t the interventions will have beneficial effects on 
OHRQOL as participants gain confidence and improve their oral health skills and 
experience better oral hygiene leading to better oral health. As Broder and others state, 
measures of OHRQOL are “congruent with patient -centered care… can help identify 
participant strengths and weakness…more accurately reflects risks and benefits of the 
intervention… and helps in defining clinically meaningful change”.  
 
The mean score at baseline for the intervention group was 30.7 (sd=10.3), which 
indicates relatively poor OHRQOL as compared to other studies. The mean score at 
follow -up was 29.9 (sd=9.9) which was not a significant change. We would not 
anticipate signifi cant changes in such a short period, but we could observe larger 
changes over a longer time period. Cronbach alpha was 0.76.

Oral health knowledge : Oral health knowledge is a 7 -item true/false test based on 
previously  developed  knowledge  test used  with low income  older  African  Americans 
(Slaughter & Evans, 2007)  (Alpha=.66).  
 
Oral health beliefs/norms : The Dental Copi[INVESTIGATOR_708364] (Wolfe, Stewart, Ma eder, 
Hartz, 1996; Wolfe, Stewart, Hartz, 1991; Wardh & Sorensen, 2005) is a 26 -item scale 
consisting of four subscales, Oral Health Beliefs, Internal Locus of Control, External 
Locus of Control, and Self -Efficacy. The scales were adapted in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1427] y and 
used to measure oral health beliefs, locus of control, and self -efficacy, key domains in 
the study model (Alpha = .61).  
 
Oral Health Norms : We will measure social norms with a scale that measures the 
perceived importance of oral hygiene behavior (Alp ha =.68 with 1 item deleted).  
 
Oral Health Social Support : These are two questions asking how building residents 
participants can obtain oral health information; and from how many others who regularly 
work in or visit the building participants can obtain o ral health information (Likert scale: 
none,1 -2, 3-4, 5 or more).  
 
Perceived Oral Health Risks:  This is a five -item scale that assesses perceived risk of 
oral heal problems, including getting cavities, toothaches, gum problems, oral cancer 
and oral health p roblems that would cause a visit to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Participants rate the 
likelihood of having these problems on a four -point Likert scale, 1 (very unlikely) to 4 
(very likely). Chronbach Alpha = 0.83.  
 
Oral hygiene behaviors : A measure consisting of questions that assess oral health 
self-management behavior including frequency and timing of brushing, flossing teeth, 
cleaning dentures (3 items, Alpha =.71).  
 
Oral health self -management fears and worries : A scale was developed from 
formative data collected through our prior studies and evaluated during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_708365]. Dental W orries Scale (23 items) 
Alpha=.90; Dental Fears (4 items) Alpha = .75.  
 
Oral Health Self -Management Intentionality : Intention to perform the oral health self - 
management behaviors, a critical component of the IM model, will be assessed using 
the protocol d escribed by [CONTACT_708400] (1980) and Tedesco, et al. (1991) and 
adapted based on formative data. Participants will be asked to rate their intention to 
brush and floss daily using a five item four point Likert scale Alpha=.81. 3.2.4 
Intervention Variabl es 
 
Exposure to norms based campaign: Dosage will be assessed by: (a) reported 
attendance at each campaign activity (three), and (b) number of activities respondent

Number of focal points addressed in intervention: This is a count based on 
respondents’ score below the cutoff points for main cognitive and behavioral domains 
measured and addressed in the intervention.

Demographic background information: Items include age, gender, buil ding, length of 
time in building, length of time in U.S., marital status, race and ethnicity, current living 
arrangement, times moved in the past year, work status, religious engagement, income 
and income satisfaction, language use, telephone, transportati on availability, home care 
and health insurance.  
 
Health status: This will be measured by: (a) subjective health status, a single item, 
shown to be a valid measure of health status across ethnic groups, (b) an index 
assessing current health status based on  self-report of diagnosis on 13 health problems 
common in older adults and used in earlier ICR studies, (c) a composite measure of 
physical health distress based on degree to which each problem prevents participation 
in normal daily activities.  
 
Self-assessed Oral health status: measured with a five point Likert scale assessing 
subjective oral health status (Locker et al., 2000).  
 
Activities of Daily Living : Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) a widely used measure of 
the functional status of an ind ividual, It consists of 8 behaviors that indicate ability to 
take care of personal basic needs (Katz , 1983; Lawton & Brody, 1969)

4 STUDY  DESIGN  
 
Overall Design : The study utilizes a modified frac tional factorial design (MFFD) which 
compares the short term outcomes of the two intervention components: the tailored 
individual level brief intervention (AMI -PM) and the group level Campaign including 
embedded oral health skills development through pract ice-to-mastery (CA+PM). It also 
evaluates the effects of differential sequencing  of these modes of delivery components 
in relation to short and longer term outcomes. Finally, it evaluates intervention  
mechanisms  through mediational modeling of the cognitiv e and the behavioral 
components over time. The two intervention components are the individualized AMI -PM 
(Component A), and the group CA+PM (Component B). To evaluate sequencing we will 
randomize pairs of senior residences into two conditions: Condition 1 and Condition 2.  
Buildings in Condition 1 will initiate with Component A, followed by [CONTACT_708401] B. 
Buildings in Condition 2 will initiate with Component B, followed by [CONTACT_708401] A. This 
study design will allow us to compare the AMI -PM outcomes to CA+PM sho rt term 
outcomes, and to determine which condition sequence (A+B or B+A) will produce the 
best clinical outcomes. Each of 3 cycles of Condition 1 (A+B) compared to Condition 2 
(B+A) will take place over a 16 -18 month period each in two matched buildings wi th an 
N of 60 per building (N per cycle of 120; total N for all three cycles approximately 360). 
We anticipate an attrition rate of approximately 25% and a final N of approximately 270 
by [CONTACT_941] T3 measure, 135 in Condition 1 and 135 in Condition 2. Primary o utcomes are 
improvements in gingival health and decreases in plaque scores.  
 
A description of the study population: Participants will be recruited from low income 
senior housing in Central Connecticut. The population consists of independent living 
older ad ults many of whom have chronic health conditions. Residents also include 
adults less than [ADDRESS_962898] meet income guidelines and be over the age of 62 or be disabled children and 
adults betwe en the ages of 18 and 61.  
 
Methods for collecting data for assessment of study objectives:  Data collection 
will consist of clinical assessment, and surveys evaluating changes in cognitive domains 
(See Section  16). 
 
Clinical Assessments: Clinical assessments will be conducted to collect data on 
Plaque Scores and Gingival Index, described in Section 3.2.1. Trained and calibrated 
licensed hygienists will conduct the exams under the supervision of [CONTACT_708459].  
 
Referrals for Emergent Dental Nee ds: Emergent dental needs are not uncommon in 
this population; when found, they will be referred to the University of CT. School of 
Dental Medicine or to the nearest Community Health Center. Emergent dental needs 
include inability to eat due to tooth or mo uth pain, visual swelling of the face or mouth, 
fever of >100.[ADDRESS_962899] been treated for the emergent dental issue they will 
be offered the opportunity to co ntinue with the study. Emergent needs will be ranked

Training and Calibration of clinical assessments ( Adapted from National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey Dental Examiners Procedures Manual  
 
Training is divided into three phases as follows:  
1. The instructional  phase  in which  examination  team  members  are familiarized  with 
research examination procedures and criteria for research  asses sments.  
2. The standardization phase in which they are trained to use standard  procedures 
and apply standard criteria for the oral health  assessments.  
3. The calibration phase in which the degree of correlation within and among  the 
examiners and the standard exa miner is  measured.  
 
Instruction  
 
The instructional phase of the training sequence was conducted by [CONTACT_708403], and standardized examiner or gold standard, 
with experience as a researcher and examiner on the previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Rajesh L alla, 
DDS is the current Clinical Director and will conduct the instructional phase with any 
new dental hygienists who join the study. He has appropriate experience both as a 
researcher and clinician. Instructions are to be conducted in each type of oral h ealth 
assessment (Gingival Index and Plaque Score). The trainer presents lectures on criteria 
for each of the oral health assessments to be used in the study. Lectures are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_708404][INVESTIGATOR_155772] a wide variety of possible observations and illustra ting 
application of assessment criteria to those observations. The lecture -slide presentations 
on each  assessment  are followed  by [CONTACT_708405]. 
Although the instructional phase consists primarily of lectures and slide presentations, 
some demonstrations of examination technique and equipment use are conducted. All 
phases of the training and calibration will be redone anytime there is a change in  clinical 
examiners.  
 
Standardization  
 
The second phase of training is devote d to standardization. During this phase of 
training, the standard examiner reviews examination procedures and techniques and 
the criteria for each assessment, stressing the importance of consistency and uniformity 
among all examiners and the standard exami ner in performing the examination and in 
applying the criteria to observations. Rationale for differences between a research 
examination and a diagnostic examination are discussed and professional ethics of

examiner and practice examinations by [CONTACT_708406]. Standardization of all examiners will be achieved by 
[CONTACT_66567] 4 patients in the field replicating  research subjects and conditions.  
Discussion will occur to aid standardization. The Clinical Director (standard examiner) 
will monitor and referee examinations and discussion of observations during these 
sessions.  
 
Calibration  
 
The reliability of the asse ssments is measured by [CONTACT_708407]. In this phase of training, the standard 
examiner and all examiners in trainin g will each examine [ADDRESS_962904] examiner (e.g., Kappa and McNemar’s Test). 
If correlations between each of the examiners and the standard examiner are not within 
acceptable ranges or some examiners are consistently highe r or lower than the 
standard examiner (i.e., significant McNemar’s test) additional training sessions will be 
scheduled.  
 
Monitoring and Recalibration  
 
Continual gathering of clean, reliable data in a consistent and uniform manner is one of 
the main objectives of the clinical control trial. Several quality control procedures will be 
carried out periodically to assure continuing quality of data gathered by  [CONTACT_708408]. As in the initial calibration, the standard examiner 
and all examiners will each examine 4 patients who are similar in demographics to the 
study population. Recalibration will occur prior to or at the beginning of each study 
cycle.  
 
Expert Replication and Monitoring Field Operations  
 
During the field operations, examiners and recorders should periodically review their 
training manuals to prevent deviation, or “drift” from the standards achieved during t he 
training period. Particular attention should be devoted to uniform adherence to the 
criteria for making correct decisions about observations such as scoring of gingival 
indices and presence or absence of plaque. Strict compliance with infection control 
procedures is another important consideration for dental teams. In order to help the 
dental teams maintain their standards, the clinical director for the study will make 
periodic visits to field personnel to observe their performance and offer feedback on the 
results of their examinations. Field observations occur twice per assessor for each time

Protocol #[ADDRESS_962905] examiner will choose one patient p er each of the 
dental hygienists on whom the examination will be replicated. The replicated exam will 
be completed in paper format and compared to the one entered on the computer so as 
not to confound the data collection for the study. The purpose of these  so called “expert 
replications” is to determine whether the examiners are maintaining the examination 
standards achieved during training, and to measure the degree of deviation, if any, from 
those standards. If correlation between the standard examiner an d the field examiner is 
not within acceptable limits, retraining will be conducted.  
 
Annual Retraining  
 
The long duration of the study (5 years) requires the need for regularly scheduled 
retraining periods. In addition to the regularly scheduled recalibrat ion sessions with the 
standard examiner, there will be an annual retraining session for each dental examiner, 
also conducted by [CONTACT_708409].  
 
Training and Calibration of Oral Hygiene Skills Assessment (Practice to Mastery 
and T0 – T3). 
 
Training is divided into two phases as follows:  
1. The instructional phase in which research interventionists and dental hygienists 
are familiarized  with oral hygiene  instruction  and oral hygiene  practice  to mastery 
skill assessment  scale.  
2. The standardization phase in which the interventionists and dental hygienists  are 
trained to use standard procedures and apply standard criteria for the oral 
hygiene skills assessment (and oral hygiene instruction for the  interventionists).  
 
Instruction  
 
The instructional phase of the training sequence was conducted by [CONTACT_708403], and standardized examiner or gold standard, 
with experience as a researcher and examiner on the previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Rajesh La lla, 
DDS is the current Clinical Director and will conduct the instructional phase with any 
new intervention staff or dental hygienist who join the study. He has appropriate 
experience both as a researcher and clinician. Instructions will be given regardin g the 
Oral Hygiene Skills Assessment Evaluation Form and each mastery level on the form.  
Demonstrations will be given using the tooth brushing models. Although the instructional 
phase consists primarily of lecture, slide presentations and video clips, some  
demonstrations of examination technique and models are conducted. All phases of the 
training and calibration will be redone anytime there is a change in field staff during the 
study.

6 STUDY  INTERVENTION  
 
Study Behavioral or Social Intervention(s) Description 
Conceptual Framework  
The conceptual framework for the study intervention based on an adaptation of 
Fishbein’s MI model utilized in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_708367] 1. Moderators  
include: demographic variables, subjective health, activities of daily living (ADLs), 
sympto ms of depression (CES -D), self -assessed oral health; Intervention variables are 
the following: cognitive behavioral mediators  to be targeted by [CONTACT_708415], oral health beliefs, oral health social support, self -reported o ral 
hygiene behaviors; oral health self -management worries and fears, oral health norms 
and behavioral intentions. Primary outcome variables  are the Plaque Score and 
Gingival Index. Oral Health Quality of Life is a secondary outcome.  
 
Intervention Implemen tation  
 
The intervention we are proposing is a tailored bi -level intervention with two 
components, an individual level component (component A) with tailored messages 
based on performance on clinical assessment results, ADLs and cognitive domains in 
the sur vey delivered through adapted motivational interviewing with practice to mastery 
(AMI -PM); and a building level campaign (component B) open to all building residents 
that includes building tailored messages based on cognitive domains and skills 
reinforceme nt through Practice to Mastery.  
 
Tailored Individual Level Intervention through Adapted Motivational Interviewing: 
(Component A).  
 
The individually tailored individual -level intervention is approximately [ADDRESS_962921] the intervention either in the privacy of 
the resident’s apartment or in a private location within the building.  
 
The AMI -PM approach will address ADL related problems, any cognitive domain for 
which the response is below a designated cutoff, th e results of the clinical assessment 
and brushing and flossing skills. The clinical examination will produce information on 
gingivitis and locations demonstrating accumulation of plaque. The survey will produce 
information on ADLs and incorrect beliefs, ga ps in knowledge, gaps in self -efficacy and 
limitations in intentions to practice and gaps in reported skills and specific oral hygiene

practices. These data will be amalgamated using standardized forms to summarize the 
participant’s cognitive and behavioral status prior to the intervention. The summary will 
be used to conduct the intervention. The AMI intervention for each participant will 
consist of the following:  
 
1. Identify the domains that score under the cutoff point and check them on  the 
Focal Point  form.  
 
2. Start the AMI with a discussion with the participant of their own oral health, oral 
health problems, concerns and fears, practices and intentions, challenges in  performing 
oral health  hygiene.  
 
3. Show the participant how their own concerns connect to their survey  responses 
and domains requiring intervention. Based on the discussion, identify any other areas 
requiring  intervention.  
 
4. Address each of the focal points (domains scoring below the cutoff point on the 
survey results), the survey and scripted set of messages for each domain (see 
appendix B) The process calls for correcting misunderstandings, increasing  knowledge 
and addressing barriers to intention (cognitive: knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, fears, 
worries, efficacy/locus of control, intention) and dealing with any ADL  concerns.  
 
5. Show participant results of their own clinical assessment illustrating  plaque 
scores.  
 
6. Demonstrate on mouth model and through videos correct brushing and  flossing.  
 
7. Observe participant brushing and flossing on mouth model and score ability  on 
P – M form.  
 
8. Review ADL needs, reported cognitive and behavioral domains, and  behavioral 
skills and build a cognitive behavioral plan together, for participant’s improvement of 
oral health.  
 
9. Obtain signature [CONTACT_708453], and make a copy for participant  and 
copy for  file. 
 
10. Participant will be given oral hygiene starter k it (tooth brush, toothpaste,  floss, 
floss holder, tongue cleaner, and denture brush and cup if needed), brushing and 
flossing handouts and denture care handout if  needed.  
 
Individuals who score below the cutoff point on each of the following domains in the  
survey (see appendix B) will require cognitive / behavioral intervention.

The group level oral health campaign involves volunteer residents as partners in the 
development of the fairs designed to delivery oral hygiene self -management messages 
based on the cognit ive domains, ADL related problems in brushing and flossing, and 
brushing and flossing skills, and offer an opportunity to practice brushing and flossing 
on a mouth model to mastery. To fulfill the requirements of the campaign component of 
the study (CA), u p to three health fairs will be implemented over approximately a three 
month period. CA+PM procedures include the following:  
 
Identification, Training and Preparation of Pro -GOH Campaign Volunteers . Throughout 
Condition 1 (AMI -PM+CA+PM) and in the first mo nth of Condition 2 (CA+PM+ AMI -PM) 
the study team will recruit [ADDRESS_962923] bilingual (English/Spanish) capacity. Once recruited, consented 
and enrolled, committee members will meet with study trainers for 2 -hour sessions twice 
a week, for a minimum five to six week period, to learn how to implement pro -oral health 
campaigns, to plan for each fair and to work with study interventionists to develop 
campaign materials. The Pro -GOH campaign events follow primary communications 
principles:  
 
a) Message redundancy : same m essage delivered through different materials  (at least 4 
different types of materials in English and  Spanish),  
 
b) Multiple channels  (messages delivered through oral, visual, written and  practice 
means)  
 
c) Multiple exposures  (each message will be presented at l east twice during each  event)  
 
d) Interactivity  of residents with each other and oral health study personnel  through 
interactive message based games and activities, for learning  reinforcement;  
 
e) Delivery of messages  through respected role models (building  volunteers, 
testimonials and oral health  experts).  
 
After each campaign event, research staff and campaign volunteers will reflect on the 
experience and document the results. The specific roles and responsibilities of the  
volunteers, working with study sta ff, include: a) learning about oral health and good oral 
health hygiene; b) using the Oral Health script materials to prepare messages for their 
fairs, linked to the theoretical domains; c) raising and addressing any concerns they 
might have about oral hea lth promotion; d) agreeing to participate in recruitment of

health skills demonstrati ons and instruction on P - M on mouth model.  
 
Standardized components of the Campaign. The core components are developed 
and structured to standardize the pro -oral health campaign, ensure the inclusion of the 
theoretical principles, and prepare for fidelit y of implementation.  
 
 Campaign messages: One message per conceptual domain based on domain 
scripts.  
 Campaign Background Materials: include AMI domain specific scripts; Domain 
maps with definitions of domains, fliers and brochures, posters, videos from 
official oral health sites (e.g.  NIDCR).  
 Campaign recruitment: Resident volunteers will recruit residents to the  campaign 
events using a plan that they devise to market the events and reach all residents 
in the building. They will prepare and post recruitment  materials.  
 Pro-GOH Campaign Activity Guide and  checklist.  
 The Campaign Passport, a document given to each building resident who 
attends each fair. It will record their name, attendance, duration of stay,  and 
stamped evidence of participation at each message station during the  fair.

8 STUDY  PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS  
 
8.1 Study  Procedures/Evaluations  
The study procedures (described in section 3) include clinical assessments to assess 
Plaque Score and Gingival Index; oral health skills assessment/Practice -to-Mastery 
assessment; a survey administered by a research assistant, and recording and hard 
copy and digital documentation of the AMI -PM to assess fidelity of the intervention.  
 
Trained interventionists will administer the AMI -PM. One or more will be fluent in 
Spanish and will undergo extensive training to assure fidelity. All intervention sessions 
will be audio recorded, with participant’s permission. Audio recordings and hard 
copy/digital documentation from 10% of the AMI -PM sessions will be reviewed to 
measure fidelity.  
 
The interventionists will conduct the training sessions for the campaign commit tee and 
will work with participants on developi[INVESTIGATOR_708372], materials and activities 
that are consistent with the conceptual model. Examples of materials will be provided to 
committee members based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
Surveys will be administered  by [CONTACT_49165], some of whom may be 
social workers, graduate or health professional students. Several will be fluent in 
Spanish. They will be supervised by [CONTACT_708418].  
 
Most of the measures we are using to assess the constructs in the conceptual model 
have been previously developed, standardized and utilized as noted in Section 3. The 
exceptions are the Oral Health Self -Management Fears and Worries scale, the 
Perceived Or al Health Risks Scale and the Oral Health Self -Management Intentionality, 
which have good internal reliability and face validity. This study will provide the 
opportunity to investigate discriminant validity. The oral health skills 
assessment/Practice to Ma stery Score is part of the intervention to assess 
improvements in participants’ oral hygiene skills on a typodont during the intervention2. 
 
The primary outcomes are the Gingival Index and Plaque Scores. These are valid and 
reliable measures of oral hygien e. A secondary outcome measure is the OHQOL (Oral 
Health Quality of Life Scale). This is also a well known and utilized validated scale 
widely used with both younger and older adults. The dental hygienists will conduct the 
majority of clinical assessments under the supervision of [CONTACT_708459] who may conduct 
some of the assessments. All assessors will be calibrated to assure inter -rate and intra - 
rater reliability.

participants are informed of this at the time of informed consent.  
 
9.1 Specification of Safety  Parameters  
 
9.1.1  Unanticipated Problems  
Participation in this study meets minimal risk criteria consistent with 45 CFR 46. Thus, 
safety monitoring for this study will focus on unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects, including unanticipated problems that meet the definition of a serio us adverse 
event.  
 
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• unexpected in  terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b)  the 
characteristics of the subject population  being  studied;  
 
• related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or  outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]);  and 
 
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was  previously 
known or  recognized.  
 
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problem s require the 
creation and completion of an unanticipated problem report form. PIs will complete the

9.3 Characteristics of an Adverse  Event  
 
9.3.1  Relationship to Study  Intervention  
To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are 
used:  
 
1. Related (Possible, Probable,  Definite)  
 
a. The event is known to occur with the study  intervention.  
 
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and ev ent onset.  
 
c. The event abates when the intervention is  discontinued.  
 
d. The event reappears upon a re -challenge with the  intervention.  
 
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not  Related)  
 
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and  event 
onset.  
 
b. An alternate etiology has been  established.  
 
9.3.2  Expectedness of SAEs  
The NIDCR Medical Monitor and the Study PIs will be responsible for determining 
whether an SAE is expected or unexpected. An adverse event will be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severi ty, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the 
risk information previously described for the intervention.

9.3.3  Severity of  Event  
The following scale will be used to grade adverse events:  
 
1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living  (ADL)  
 
2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; moderate  impact 
on ADL 
 
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject  seeks 
medical attention, needs major assistance with  ADL 
 
9.4 Reporting Procedures  
The UCHC IRB requires reporting of unexpected adverse events that may represent an 
unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]). Such events are 
to be re ported using the Problem Report Form available on the UCHC website. Upon 
review the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may require changes to informed consent 
forms and/or protocols or other actions such as increased monitoring. The IRB makes 
the final determination as to whether an internal adverse event constitutes an 
unanticipated problem and whether changes to the consent and/or protocol are 
required. For exte rnal events, the sponsor should indicate if they have deemed the 
event to be a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961], and if so the IRB is to be informed.  
 
All investigators and study personnel must be familiar with the  policy for reporting  
unanticipated problems , inclusive of unexpected adverse events that may be 
unanticipated problems, to the IRB. All policies are available on the UCHC website. 
Such events mus t be reported using the Problem Report Form within 5 working days (7 
calendar days) of becoming aware of the event. See Section 9.3.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_962931] all reportable events 
with start dates occurring any time after informed consent i s obtained until 7 (for non - 
serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each 
study  visit, the investigator  will inquire  about  the occurrence  of AE/SAEs  since  the last 
visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 
These events will be reported in writing to NIDCR within 5 working days for serious 
adverse events and within one month for non -serious adverse  events.  
 
9.4.2  Serious Adverse Event Reporting to NIDCR  
Any AE meeting the specified Serious Adverse Event criteria will be submitted on an 
SAE form to NIDCR’s centralized safety reporting system via

10 STUDY  OVERSIGHT  
 
The Principal Investigators, Drs. Reisine and Schensul, PIs on the prior NIDCR funded 
studies, will be responsible for study oversight, including monitoring safety, ensuring 
that the study is conducted according to the protocol and ensuring data integrity. The 
PIs will review the data for safety concerns and data trends at regular intervals, and will 
promptly report to the IRB and NIDCR any Unanticipated Problem (UP), protocol 
deviation, or any other significant event that arises during the conduct of the study.  
 
In addition to the PIs responsibility for oversight, study oversight will be under the 
direction of the NIDCR Medical Monitor. The PIs will submit a report every [ADDRESS_962933] with the field administrative team.  
 
It is our practice for the research team to meet weekly and this group functions as a 
steering committee. We discuss and monitor: the general design and conduct of the 
study: preparation of the essential study documents, including the protocol, protocol 
amendments, MOP and data collection forms; review of data collection practices and 
procedures; changes in study procedures as appropriate; alloc ation of resources based 
on priorities of competing study demands; review of study progress and implementation 
of necessary steps to ensure the achievement of study goals; review and 
implementation of recommendations from those responsible for safety monit oring. We 
submit a monthly report electronically to the NIDCR program officers to keep them 
advised of our progress.

12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Study  Hypotheses  
1. The AMI -PM will produce better shor t term (T1) clinical outcomes than  the 
Campaign (CA+PM) (AIM  1). 
 
2. The CA+PM+AMI -PM will produce better mid -term (T2) and long -term (T3) 
clinical outcomes than the AMI -PM+CA+PM (AIM  2). 
 
3. The AMI -PM will produce more change in mediating cognitive domains than  the 
CA+PM.  
 
4. Both AMI -PM+CA+PM and CA+PM+AMI -PM will result in no differences  in 
change in mediating cognitive domains from T0 to  T2. 
 
5. The greater the dosage (proportion of total talking points recorded for all  domains 
in a tailored AMI; and exposure to campaign activities and messages), the better 
the outcomes.  
 
6. We will investigate an exploratory hypothesis examining the effects of the 
intervention and sequence on oral health quality of life (a secondary outcome), 
as well as on clinical  outcomes.

Attrition : Longitudinal studies must account for attrition. If we assume a conservative 
75% retention rate across the study that would leave us with approximately N=135 per 
intervention group, or N=45 per building.  
 
Effects of intra -class correlation (ICC) within s ites: The cluster design can sometimes 
impact the power of a study and our calculations consider this human phenomenon. To 
account for the cluster design, we calculated the effective sample size which is the 
sample size used for power calculations, accordi ng to Killip et al. With this design we 
expect to have 6 clusters of N=45 each finish the study, or 135 per sequence. Assuming 
an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.[ADDRESS_962936] the sample sizes used in calculations. As a result, our 
sample size calculations are based on a maximum number of N=123 per intervention 
(not 135) after accounting for loss of power due to intra -class correlation. Using N=123 
per group, our power ranged from 91 to 99 for different scenarios reflecting varied 
assumptions, as shown in the attached memo from September 5, 2016.  
 
Calculation for Primary Outcomes : While the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] d ata provide a good starting point for 
sample size estimation, we acknowledge that the study was small and the results 
provide only estimates. To be conservative regarding pi[INVESTIGATOR_3690], we 1) decreased the 
observed effect size by 25% and 2) used the upper 95% CL of the standard deviation 
for calculations. Employing these two hedges gives protection and helps assure we will 
have sufficient power to detect similar (or smaller) effect sizes with 80% power. With 
N=135 per group our study still has more that 90%  power to find detect the mean 
differences (MD) in the table below.

Period 1: parallel arm phase:  Standard approaches for a parallel [ADDRESS_962938] comparison of the AMI vs. the Campaign app roach for clinical 
outcomes (Study Hypothesis #1).  
 
Periods 1 and 2: assessing sequence of interventions : Study Hypothesis #2, which 
sequence gives better clinical outcomes, will be addressed using repeated measures 
models. Depending on whether the outcome is continuous or dichotomous, we use 
general linear mixed models (GLMM) or general estimating equations  (GEE), 
respectively, to fit a model with intervention and period effects using the MIXED 
procedure in SAS. Each set of measures from the same person (e.g., gingival 
outcomes) are treated as a correlated cluster of data. An AR -1 correlation structure is

likely to be appropriate. Customized contrasts can be constructed to make comparisons 
between time points. Time -varying covariates can be used in these models, and some 
missing data (under MAR or MCAR assumptions where applicable), is allowab le. 
 
Baseline & health status variables:  As this study randomizes at the level of site and 
individuals are not randomized, we will likely stratify some results (or adjust in models) 
for demographics such as age, gender, marital status and individual charac teristics 
such as health status, ADLs, depressive symptoms (CES -D) and oral health status 
(self-assessment). Any variable that shows potential for confounding or effect 
modification will be accounted for appropriately in all stages of the analysis.  
 
Interv ention variables : As all subjects are exposed to the same interventions, it is of 
interest to unpack the intervention into 1) dosage (percent of talking points covered for 
all focal points (domains) addressed in the intervention, and 2) exposure to focal p oint 
messages during campaigns. Study Hypothesis #5, regarding dosage of interventions, 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_708419]’s exposure to 
talking points through participation in the AMI and exposure to messages via 
campaigns, thus creating a measure of dosage. We will then assess if dosage predicts 
better outcomes. This can be done directly (e.g., compare mean gingival scores across 
dosage levels with ANOVA) or dosage can be used as a predictor variable in the 
statistic al models and causal pathway analyses. Oral health skills/Practice -to-Mastery 
(a 4 point Likert scale) and focal points (count variable) can be analyzed using similar 
techniques and approaches.

Cognitive Mediators : The following variables will be incorporated into the causal 
pathway analysis to address example hypotheses #3 and #4: knowledge, oral health 
beliefs/norms, social support, oral hygiene behaviors, fears/worries, practice to mastery, 
and behavioral  intentions.  We will use longitudinal  mediation  to compared  the efficacy  of 
AMI-PM+CA+PM to CA+PM+AMI -PM in terms of whether they differ significantly in the 
amount of change that they engender in the gingival index and plaque score, indirectly 
through the mediators measured in our  model.

The classical Barron & Kenny (1986) mediation approach to longitudinal mediation 
would examine whether the intervention impacts the levels of our mediators, such as 
beliefs, at T1 (for example), which in turn affect clinical outcome measures resulting 
from participant behaviors as measured by [CONTACT_708420] T2. 
Or, simply put, whether levels of self -efficacy at T1 are associated with the levels of 
gingival index scores at T2 indirectly through self -efficacy at T1 (and other mediators 
previously referenced). But, we are interested in examining whether there is a change  in 
our mediators over time, and if so, whether this change significantly leads to a change 
in behaviors, as assessed by [CONTACT_708421]. Recent 
methodological studies actually show that the analysis of change is more appropriately 
captured by [CONTACT_708422] (differences) in self -efficacy and our other mediators and 
behavioral outcomes between adjacent time points (i.e. T1 -T0, and T2 -T1) as latent 
difference scores, and explicitly modeling these change scores to represent dynamic 
change, i.e., the impact of change in the mediators on change in the behavioral 
outcomes.  
 
Hypothesis #3 will be tested using latent change score analysis spe cifying AMI and 
Campaign as predictors of change in behavioral beliefs(ΔBB), OH social support (ΔSS), 
locus of control beliefs(ΔCB), self -efficacy(ΔSE), fears/worries (ΔF/W), social norms 
(ΔSN), and behavioral intentions (ΔBI) from baseline to first and se cond follow -up. 
 
To test hypothesis #4, we will conduct dynamic mediation using latent change 
(difference) score (LCS) mediation analysis. The analyses will be conducted in Mplus 7 
where change (difference) scores representing differences in each mediator and 
outcome variable from baseline to final follow up (i.e. T1 -T0 (ΔT 10), and T2 -T1(ΔT 21) will 
be generated. It is the difference scores of the mediators and outcome variables that 
are modeled. Generally speaking, causal paths specifying latent (true) chan ge, 
represented by [CONTACT_708423], oral health beliefs/norms, OH social support, oral 
hygiene behaviors, fears/worries, oral health practice to mastery skills, and behavioral 
intentions in going from T0 to T1, and T1 to T2 will be specified, to predic t change in 
Gingival Index and Plaque Scores at T2 (i.e., ΔGingival Index 21, ΔPlaque score 21). For 
example, we will test whether change in fears/worries from T0 to T1 significantly 
predicts changes in Gingival Index and Plaque Scores at final follow -up,T2 (ΔGingival 
Index 21, ΔPlaque scores 21). To assess the impact of the change in self -efficacy (ΔSE), 
on changes in Gingival Index scores (ΔGingival Index), direct and indirect paths from 
change in self -efficacy from baseline to first follow up (ΔSE 10) that predict the change in 
Gingival Index at the final follow -up (ΔGingival Index 30) will be specified and tested.  
Select direct and indirect paths from change scores of the other mediator variables to 
change scores of behavioral outcomes will also be sp ecified in a similar fashion, and all 
these relationships will be tested simultaneously.  
 
Summary : Using a conservative set of assumptions and based on our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], 
we have  demonstrated,  using  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_708374],  that we will have  sufficient  power 
to detect significant changes, using a two -group t -test which makes  minimal

13 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE  DATA/DOCUMENTS  
 
There are three sources of data for the study which include the survey, the clinical 
assessment of the Gingival Index and Plaque Scores, and campaign 
participation/dosage. The survey will be administered through the Questionnaire 
Development System (QDS) e lectronic data collection system installed on individual 
password -protected laptop computers, backed up on password -protected flash drives, 
and downloaded each day into a study designated directory and database on a 
password -protected computer by [CONTACT_708424]. The data directories are 
backed -up automatically each day. Each interviewer will have her/his own designated 
laptop computer and flash drive. Interviewers will check each interview file for missing 
data and completeness before saving to the data directories.  
 
Data from the clinical assessments will be recorded electronically (See Appendix B). 
The oral hygiene skills assessment will be conducted by [CONTACT_708425]. Data will be tracked in an ACCESS data file.  
 
Individual Passports for each person attending each of the fairs in the campaign will 
include the person’s name, time of arrival and time of l eaving. The passport will collect 
information on what activities they participated in. The Passport will be stamped at 
each activity. Passports will be collected at the end of each fair during the building 
campaign and the number of activities and other da ta will be recorded in an ACCESS 
file as a measure of dosage of the intervention and linked to the individual’s ID.

Protocol #[ADDRESS_962940] will maintain a tracking database to assure that all 
necessary documents are completed for each participant ; follow -up surveys and clinical 
assessments are completed on time; and AMI sessions are completed on schedule.  
This electronic file will include participant names because it is used to track and follow 
participants. It is password protected, kept in a dir ectory that is only accessible to study 
staff, and is only available to study staff and PIs. Additionally, each research record will 
have a checklist on the inside cover to assure that all necessary documents are 
completed for each participant; follow -up surveys and clinical assessments are 
completed on time; and AMI sessions are completed on schedule. The format for both 
files is shown in the appendix.  
 
Survey data collection will be accomplished using the Questionnaire Development

Additional Quality Assurance Activities  
 
Survey:  
The Screener and Survey in QDS is designed with built in controls to minimize data 
entry errors. The data entry controls will be adjusted during the first few weeks of data 
collection based on the real needs from the field.  
 
Participation process  (from initial contact [CONTACT_708427]) will be  documented 
in a tracking table in Access which allows multiple queries to check data status, 
potential errors and take action to make correction at the earliest  stages  
Multi -dimensional data collec tion forms (e.g. clinical assessment, intervention process 
etc.) will be entered into Access forms. Then they will be imported into either SPSS for

Intervention  
Face to face AMI : The first five audio recorded AMIs will be checked for consistency 
against hard copy (Focal Point record), hard copy plan and Access database digital 
fidelity forms. Thereafter 10% of all audio recorded AMI s will be reviewed and checked 
for fidelity by [CONTACT_45210]. Areas of inconsistency or incompleteness will be addressed 
through review and retraining. After each AMI is completed, all participant responses 
will be entered into the Access database by [CONTACT_941] i nterventionists. The Intervention 
Coordinator will review each AMI record entered into the database to insure that all 
components of the AMI session have been completed and  documented.  
 
Campaign fairs : All recording forms (attendance, passport), will be co llected, linked to 
enrolled participants, and checked for completeness. Observations will note instances 
of message delivery in general sessions, and participation at PM station. Campaign 
passport  data will be recorded  for dosage.  Documentation  will be reviewed  after the first 
campaign, and gaps and missing data for participants noted and  corrected.  
 
Calibration of clinical assessment : Recalibration will take place and be recorded prior to 
or early during administration of T0 of each cycle (approximately on ce a year).  
 
Random audits  of participant research records will take place every six months to 
assure that all documents are filed properly in the research record. Ten records will be 
selected every six months for review. Corrective actions will be taken i f problems are 
found. The IRB/Human Subjects Coordinator also will review all completed consent 
forms on a weekly basis to insure use of current IBR -approved forms that are properly 
signed and dated. Corrective actions will be taken if problems are found.

16.2 Data Capture  Methods  
Data will be collected in 4 ways:  
 
a) Survey (cognitive and all reported health related behavior including ADLs, dry 
mouth);  
 
b) Observation  methods;  
 
c) Clinical screening  forms;  
 
d) Electronic records of intervention  administration.  
 
16.3 Types of Data  
Two classes of data will be collected in this study: a) evaluation data; b) intervention 
data.  
 
The outcome evaluation data to be collected in this study are of two types: clinical 
assessments of gingiva and plaque; and survey assessing ADLs and cognitive 
domains. (As noted earlier we will continue to collect oral hygiene skills data, but will not 
be using the data for outcome  analysis.)  
 
The intervention process/fidelity data to be collected in this study will be collected during 
the face to face intervent ion (AMI -PM) and campaign (CA+PM) and include:  
 
AMI-PM: record of main domains requiring attention in the intervention (Focal point 
record including domains to be addressed, whether they are or not, and whether the 
correct script is delivered for each poin t); P-M pre and post scores; and participant plan 
of action (copy to participant and for electronic file).  
 
CA+PM: record of exposure to all campaigns through a “passport” recording presence, 
duration, and visits to stations during campaign, including part icipation in practice to 
mastery. Data will be collected from the passport and entered into the intervention data 
base as presence/absence for each “page” (station), date of fair, time of entry and exit.  
 
16.4 Schedule and Content of  Reports  
The Access data tra cking file will allow for weekly and monthly updates of intervention 
and evaluation progress. Reports on enrollment, evaluation (screening, skills 
assessment, clinical assessment and survey), and completion of intervention will be 
provided to the study tea m initially on a weekly or biweekly basis as needed.

Paper proposals will be discussed during weekly meetings of the research team. After 
receiving an email from PIs approving the paper proposal, the authors will sign an 
agreement by [CONTACT_708436] . This will help prevent future conflicts and delineate the level of contribution each 
author would be required to make towards the scientific paper/monograph.  
 
Authorship Guidelines  
 
Authorship and Contributorship  
 
According to the International Committee  on Medical Journal Ethics (ICMJE), an author 
is defined as one who has made substantial contributions to the conception and 
development of a manuscript. The ICMJE guidelines state that “authorship credit should 
be based on all of the following: 1) substan tial contributions to conception and design, 
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or 
advising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version 
to be published”. All other  contributors should be listed as acknowledgements.  
 
This means that, while all project staff and investigators may be included as authors on 
any publications produced from this study, they will only be included as an author on 
any given publication or pre sentation if they meet guidelines for authors as defined by 
[CONTACT_708437]. Otherwise, project investigators and staff, as 
defined above, will be listed as contributors to a given manuscript. HOWEVER, every 
effort will be made to involv e all above listed investigators as authors on each paper 
produced from this project. It is the responsibility of the lead author on each given paper 
from this project to ensure such opportunities for involvement are given. A lead author 
must contact [CONTACT_708438].  
 
Authorship Order  
 
LEAD/FIRST AUTHOR -- The lead or first author of a given paper or professional 
presentation will lead conceptualization and writing of a given manuscript or 
professional presentation. He or she will also decide authorship involvement and order. 
All of this will be subject t o approval from the principal investigators, using the 
procedure outlined in the Procedures for Approval of Manuscript/Paper/ Presentation. It 
is the responsibility of the lead author to ensure that all listed authors on the paper or 
presentation contribut e at the level submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_978]. Alteration of

Protocol #14 -046-E 
54  
  
authorship order subsequent to this approval will require re -approval by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_708378].  
 
SECOND AUTHOR -- The second author of a given paper or pro fessional presentation 
will support the paper with co -conceptualization and extensive writing, such as taking a 
leadership role on writing a section of the paper or presentation. Given the nature of 
partnership between the university and ICR, the second au thor should be from one of 
these organizations. This approach will increase the collaboration, knowledge, and 
perspectives offered by [CONTACT_708439]. For lead authors with less writing 
experience, inclusion of a more seasoned publication writer is recommended for second 
authors.  
 
SENIOR (LAST) AUTHOR -- Senior authors of papers will be positioned as such due to 
their oversight of the paper/presentation as a whole and their ability to ensure that the 
paper/presentation fits within the overall study  and the previous and ongoing papers 
and presentations developed from the initiative. As such, principal investigators are in 
the optimal position to serve as senior author on all papers and presentations produced 
from their respective studies.  
 
Role of th e lead author to Pursue the Paper/Presentation Once Approved: A lead 
author of an approved paper or presentation will have SIX MONTHS from the date of 
approval to submit the DRAFT paper or presentation for review. Should the paper or 
presentation not be co mpleted within that SIX MONTHS time frame, rights to lead 
author this work are relinquished.  
 
Obligations to Maintain Author Involvement on a Paper: In accordance with the 
guidelines of most journals, authors are required to share revisions and resubmissio ns 
with all authors at every resubmission. Nothing should be submitted to any journal or 
any conference without approval from all authors on the paper or presentation; unless 
they agree that you may submit it without their final approval. Each author must be 
provided with a final copy of any submitted manuscript, report or presentation for their 
records. The primary author must also provide each author with a full citation of 
presented or published work. Make sure to include PIs.  
 
Changing Approved Paper To pic, including Hypotheses and Expected Variables 
to be Explored, Authors and Authorship Order, Journal or Conference for 
Submission: Any changes in information provided and approved via this topic approval 
process will require resubmission of the Topic App roval Form with specifications as to 
why these changes are needed. Authors may not alter this information without approval 
from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_708379]. In such intentions, the lead author should discuss 
with other authors and send an email to the PIs  and get feedback on the suggested 
change.

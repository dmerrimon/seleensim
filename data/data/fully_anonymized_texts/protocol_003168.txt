B. Introduction  
B1.     Study Abstract  
One in five children in the U.S. now has obesity.[ADDRESS_1280381], such as 
FBT,4,5 they are not widely available.6-11 Even when available, these treatments are costly and 
time -intensive, limiting reach, scalability, and adoption. More scalable approaches are needed 
for addressing  childhood obesity. We propose to develop and build a 10 -minute, prototype VR 
experience for children with overweight/obesity and their parents, based on a key tenet of FBT, 
in order to foster commitment to behavior changes in a format that would be engagi ng for 
children and scalable. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_911511]/obesity and their parents over two cycles to inform refinements.  
B2.     Primary Hypothesis  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_911512] a small -scale randomized trial will allow for analysis of 
feasibility for a larger -scale NIH grant and provide initial impressions on whether VR may be able 
to magnify the effects of consideration of future consequences on cognitions and behavior.  
C. Background  
C1.     Rationale for this Study  
VR has been described as “the most psychologically powerful medium” in history.12 A 
fundamental characteristic of VR is that it provides users with a sense of “being there” (i.e., 
psychological presence), which results in VR environments producing emotional, behavioral, and 
physiological responses similar to those in real life, particu larly in children.13-15 VR has shown 
promise for addressing obesity, eating disorders, and other psychiatric concerns in adults,16-19 
yet to date, there is a dearth of research on VR for childhood obesity. For this prototype, we 
plan to translate the FBT s trategy of epi[INVESTIGATOR_911513], which involves mentally 
projecting oneself into the future and pre -experiencing” a future event through visualization.20 
This increases the value of future events and hence motivation.21 Given VR’ s ability to create 
psychological presence, this strategy is ripe for translation. If successful, this approach has 
potential for widespread dissemination and is in line with T3 research, as the ultimate goal is to 
translate key tenets from an evidence -based treatment into everyday settings by [CONTACT_2329] a more 
scalable format. This work is highly aligned with the Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research,22 
which highlights key research opportunities, including “design[ing] and test[ing] novel weight -
control inte rventions that incorporate existing or emerging technologies (e.g., …virtual reality 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 
______________________________________________________________________________________  
6 
 mediums)” and investigating “how electronic applications…can expand reach… and rapid 
dissemination.”  
C2.     Prior Literature and Stud ies 
Research has shown that VR is a promising tool for augmenting treatment approaches,[ADDRESS_1280382] adults’ prosocial behavior and social anxiety;28 
however, less is known about VR’s ef fects in children. VR research in children has focused on 
treatment of ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, pain, and rehabilitation,27, 29 and 
research with children undergoing physical rehabilitation suggests VR increases children’s self -
efficacy and  adherence to their exercises by [CONTACT_911518].[ADDRESS_1280383]. Denis e Wilfley and colleagues.5,33 One 
key tenet involves consideration of future consequences (i.e., epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681]) to 
promote behavior change and is ripe for translation to VR, whereby [CONTACT_911519]. Specifically, a VR experience could amplify the impact of this strategy by  [CONTACT_17155] 
a child to experience what it might be like to live in various bodies in the future and see the 
long -term effects of d ietary and activity behaviors in the immediate . Leveraging the flexibility of 
VR allows for the creation of avatars whose movements can differ from that of the 
participants' own, increasing the potential impact of consideration of the “future self” on 
moti vation and behavior.34,[ADDRESS_1280384] of consideration of one’s 
future or “possible” self on motivation and behavior across domains,36,[ADDRESS_1280385] individuals with a future self to 
promote behavior change;[ADDRESS_1280386] (studies 1 and 2) would translate a key tenet of FBT into a burgeoning 
technology and examine the usability, acceptability, and ef ficacy of the intervention on 
motivation and behavior among children aged 6 -12 with overweight/obesity and their parents.  
D. Study Objectives  
D1.     Study Aim  
Study 2 aims to evaluate the efficacy of the VR experience vs video in terms of (2a) 
acceptability, (2b) motivation for behavior change, (2c) behavioral beliefs and intentions, 
and (2d) behavior (i.e., physical activity and dietary behavior two  weeks later). Outcomes 
will be assessed at both the child and parent levels. Finally, we will compare the indirect 
effects of the two conditions on behavior through behavioral cognitions (2e; exploratory).

[ADDRESS_1280387] height and 
weight measured. To determine acceptability (Aim 2a), we will use the SUS and USE. Those 
randomly assigned to VR will also complete the PQ. To examine motivation to make behavior 
change (Aim 2b) , participants will complete measures assessing self efficacy39 and readiness to 
change behavior.40 Specifically, they will complete the 16 -item Self-Efficacy for Healthy Eating 
and Physical Activity measure41 and self -efficacy to lose weight will be asses sed with the 8 -item 
Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire.42,43 Readiness to change behavior will be measured by 
[CONTACT_941] 6 -item Readiness to Change Diet and Physical Activity Scale.44 To examine behavioral beliefs 
and intentions (Aim 2c), participants will complete measures of behavioral cognitions from the 
Theory of Plan ned Behavior, including behavioral beliefs, attitudes, and intentions related to 
eating an activity behaviors.45,46 Finally, to examine behavior (Aim 2d), participants will complete 
self-report measures of activity and eating behavior over the past week, a dapted from the 
Health Behavior in School -aged Children survey47 at baseline and [ADDRESS_1280388] Schedule for Child and Parent48 will be administered to control for 
mood and the child emotional eating scale serves  as a measure of emotion regulation. Body 
esteem will be measured with several items from the Body Esteem Scale.49, 50   
E. Study Design  
E1.     Overview or Design Summary                                                                         
Study 2 will use a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_911514] a video 
(created by [CONTACT_911520]) that provides child -friendly education on what types of foods are 
most nutritiou s and which are less healthy, and how the food they eat and activity they engage 
in now affects their health and future. The video will also encourage consideration of future 
consequences.

    E2.C.     Ethical Considerations  
All key personnel involved in the design or conduct of research involving human subjects will 
receive the required education on the protection of human research participa nts prior to the 
start of the study. Participants will be informed that they do not have to answer any questions 
that make them uncomfortable. There are minimal risks for participating in pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]. Testing 
and assessments will occur in private rooms t o protect the anonymity of the participant.  
 
Participants will be provided with the contact [CONTACT_258359]. As a clinical 
psychologist, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_258353]. The PI, a licensed psychologist, will 
be available  for in -person crisis assessment. Any participants that indicate they are engaging in 
disordered eating behaviors during screening or participation in the study will be offered 
referral information for in -person treatment. Any adverse event will be reporte d promptly to 
the IRB.  
 
Confidentiality: Participant confidentiality will be maintained in compliance with HIPAA privacy 
protected servers. Study IDs will be linked with participant names and email addresses in a 
separate password -protected file stored on a secure, password -protected server that only key 
study personnel have access to. All hard copy PHI will be stored in locked cabinets within locked 
doors in our laboratory at WUSM. All employees of the study with access to PHI are required to 
complete HIPA A training and comply with the privacy procedures in place at Washington 
University.  
 
BehaVR (https://behavr.com) is a HIPAA -compliant company focused on building VR 
products for behavior change and has a dedicated and talented team of software 
engineers.  BehaVR will host the proposed VR experience and all data collected within the 
VR experience. Prior to beginning this study, BehaVR and Washington University will 
enter into a collaboration agreement.  
 
Adverse Events:  For the purpose of this study, adver se events will be defined as 
unanticipated problems involving risks to the study participant. A serious adverse event will 
be defined as any untoward occurrence that results in death, is life -threatening, or creates 
persistent and significant disability. T he study team will work together to identify serious 
adverse events. Any potentially adverse events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_126786] [ADDRESS_1280389] of mouth. Flyers will be posted in local (i.e., primarily St. Louis, MO) kid -friendly public 
spaces. Social media recruitment will occur over family -friendly social  media and webpages. The 
social media advertisement will be posted on relevant WUSM accounts and to relevant web 
pages (i.e. family -based and health related pages and groups). We may also utilize participant 
recruitment services available through REC and R EACH. Additionally, we may seek permission 
from WU PAARC to ask pediatric practices that are familiar with our lab through another study 
we are conducting (PLAN with families) if they would be willing to advertise for this study via 
postcards made availabl e to give to patient families.  
 
Interested individuals may call or email our research team whose contact [CONTACT_911521]. If individuals are st ill interested after discussing the study directly with a research 
team member over phone and/or email, a research team member will conduct a brief phone 
screen to determine eligibility. If eligible, an appointment will be made for the parent and child 
to come into our lab at WUSM to review and sign consent and assent documents and then 
complete the study. Consent and assent information will be emailed to them so that they may 
have plenty of time to review these documents at their leisure. Upon arrival to o ur lab the 
informed consent process will take place, and subsequently the study. The informed consent 
process will occur in a private room in the Center for Healthy Weight and Wellness at 
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Participants will be consented according 
to the policies and procedures of the WUSM IRB, the IRB of Record for the study.  
 
8/10/21  
We will also use snowball sampling by [CONTACT_911522].  
      E2.E.     Randomization Method  
Using a random number generator, families will be randomly assigned to the experimental or 
control condition after baseline measures are taken. Those assigned to the experimental

 condition will undergo the 10 -minute VR experience (both children and parents) while those 
assigned to the control condition will view the educational video and play the educational game  
for a total of 10 minutes.  
     E2.F.     Risks and Benefits  
Risks: All key personnel involved in the design or conduct of research involving human subjects 
will receive the required education on the protection of huma n research participants prior to 
the start of the study. Participants will be informed that they do not have to answer any 
questions that make them uncomfortable. There are minimal risks for participating in pliot 
testing. Testing and assessments will occu r in private rooms to protect the anonymity of the 
participant.  
 
Participants will be provided with the contact [CONTACT_187101]. As a clinical 
psychologist, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_258353]. If any participant appears to be 
in crisis during the experiment, appropriate action will be taken based on established crisis 
assessment protocol. All participants completing the experiment will be offered referral 
information for in -person treatment. Any serious adverse event will be re ported promptly to 
the IRB.  
 
Physical Risks: Participants will be engaging with the virtual environment through physical 
movement (e.g., steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), and will be unable to see their surroundings (because they will be 
wearing a device over their eyes to engag e with the VR experience), so the area in which 
individuals use the VR equipment will be open and clear of objects. Users will be monitored by 
[CONTACT_911523]. Finally, some individuals can 
feel motion sick ness or nausea during a VR experience. Although this is not likely, participants 
will be told that if they do not feel well, they do not have to continue with the VR experience 
and that they can discontinue participation in this aspect of the study without  penalty. Trained 
staff will assist in the event that participants need further care.   
 
Psychological Risks: There are minimal psychological risks of participating in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_911515], although we recognize that programs desi gned to address weight 
may promote increased focus on weight in some individuals, more than which may exist before 
starting the program. It is also possible that participants may feel uncomfortable disclosing 
information or related thoughts about their wei ght. However, we have asked questions of a 
similar nature in several studies in the past and have not had participants report major 
discomfort. Because children may also be more likely to perceive the virtual environment as 
real, special consideration will  be given to children after the VR experience to ensure they 
understood that the VR environment was not real  if necessary (we did not find this to be an 
issue in study 1) . Finally, participants may experience negative affect when experiencing the 
future em bodiment part of the time machine game that is reflective of continued engagement 
in unhealthy behaviors with decreased agility. In order to decrease the likelihood of negative 
affect in the VR experience, all participants in the VR condition will experien ce the healthy and 
unhealthy future self, and the first future they go to will be determined by a food choice game 
in the present. This gives the participant the autonomy of choice, and presents two different 
futures, so that it is clear that they are not being told one way or another how they may feel in 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 
______________________________________________________________________________________  
[ADDRESS_1280390] how it may feel if they were to engage in healthy vs. unhealthy behavior. 
Participants will be told that if they feel too uncomfortable in the VR experience, they can stop 
using it at any time without penalty.   
 
Social Risks : There may be some embarrassment related to completing questions related to 
weight and intentions to lose weight.  
 
Financial Risks: N/A 
 
Legal Risks : N/A  
 
Risks to Privacy : There are minimal to no risks to participant privacy. We will go to great lengths 
to keep participant information private and confidential.  
 
Other Risks : N/A  
 
Alternative Treatment s: N/A – Participants in the current study will be participating in a pil ot 
trial to test a VR experience to address childhood obesity. There are few widely available 
digital tools designed for this purpose. All participants who participate will be offered referral 
information for in -person treatment.  
 
Benefits  
 
For individuals  participating in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there may be no direct benefits in terms of 
addressing overweight or obesity. However, individuals participating may benefit from 
knowing that their feedback is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_911516] a digital tool that may ultimately address  
childhood obesity.  
 E2.G.     Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
Informed consent will make clear that participants may withdraw at any time with no penalty.  
     E2.H.     When and How t o Withdraw Participants  
Taking part in this research study is voluntary. Participants may choose not to take part in this 
research study or may withdraw their consent at any time. They may withdraw by [CONTACT_911524] d in participating in the study. If participants do not

J. Statistical Analysis Plan  
Univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) models evaluated pre - to post -test changes in positive 
and negative affect by [CONTACT_3004]. T -tests evaluated the difference in acceptability measures 
between c onditions. Repeated -measures general linear models, with time as the within -subjects 
factor, tested the effect of the VR intervention on eating and activity behaviors (pre to two -
weeks) and cognitions (pre to post) . Child age was included as a covariate in  all analyses . Tests 
of normality were conducted on dependent variables across and within conditions using 
histograms, normality plots, skewness, and kurtosis metrics, and relevant dependent variables 
were transformed (e.g., cubed) when necessary. Assumpti ons of linearity and homogeneity of 
regression slopes were examined with scatterplots and interaction terms of condition and the 
relevant pre -test variable.

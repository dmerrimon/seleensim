2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Study Disease  
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are th e most common human cancer, affecting approximately 
750,000 Americans per year (Epstein, 2008) .  Based on rapi[INVESTIGATOR_640998], it is 
estimated that almost 1 in 3 Caucasians born in the [LOCATION_002] after 1994 will develop a BCC 
during the ir lifetime (Miller and Weinstock, 1994) .  Like that of other skin cancers, BCC risk is 
correlated inversely with the degree of skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_640999] (UV) or ionizing radiation (IR) .  Patients affected by [CONTACT_641043] c ell nevus syndrome 
(BCNS, Gorlin syndrome, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome; OMIM #109400), a rare 
autosomal dominant inherited disorder, have a dramatically increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_641000] 
(developi[INVESTIGATOR_641001]) and as we ll as an increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_641002] ( eg, medulloblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas) 
(Gorlin,  1987) .  Patients with BCNS inherit a defective copy of the tumor suppressor gene, 
PTCH1 , which acts as a primary inhibitor of the hed gehog (HH) signaling pathway 
(Hahn , et al, 1996 ; Johnson , et al, 1996) .  PTCH1  gene mutations and loss of the remaining 
wild-type allele also have been identified in sporadic basal cell carcinomas and 
medulloblastomas, suggesting a common genetic basis for  the sporadic and 
syndrome -associated cancers (Hahn , et al, 1996 ; Johnson , et al, 1996 ; Xie, et al, 1997 ; 
Raffel , et al, 1997 ;  Ling, et al, 2001) .  Mutations in SMO, the downstream molecule that is the 
target of PTCH1 inhibition, occur in approximately 10 % of sporadic BCCs with resultant 
resistance of SMO protein to inhibition by [CONTACT_641044]1 protein (Xie , et al, 1998 ; 
Reiffenberger , et al, 1998) .  Essentially all BCCs, whether or not associated with identifiable 
mutations of PTCH1 or of SMO, have enhanced  HH signaling .  BCCs generally are treated by 
[CONTACT_585964], which in many cases is scarring and disfiguring .  Currently there is no reliable 
medical (non -surgical) therapy for treatment of either BCNS -related or sporadic BCCs .  Oral 
retinoid treatment of  BCNS patients can reduce the rate of development of BCCs but does so 
only at a dose that usually produces intole rable side effects (Peck,  et al, 1988 ; 
Tangrea , et al, 1992) .  The clinical use of SMO antagonist s which suppress HH signaling have 
efficacy an d are FDA approved for the treatment of BCC providing strong scientific evidence 
CONFIDENTIAL:  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 8 of 51  2 October  2020  that HH inhibition can be a highly effective approach to chemotherapy and chemoprevention of 
BCC (Tang , et al, 2016).  
2.2 Study Agent   
Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors, i ncluding vorinostat and romidepsin were approved  by 
[CONTACT_641045] T-cell lymphoma  (CTCL) (Mann  BS, et al, 2007) .  
HDAC  inhibitors antagonize tumors by  [CONTACT_641046], through modulating the level of acetylation /deacetylation  of histones and/or 
non-histone proteins such as transcription factors .   
Unpublished data has s hown HDAC inhibitors can inhibit the growth of BCC cells and BCC 
tumors in vitro and in vivo.  
HDAC inhibitors can suppres s growth of BCC cell lines  
To study the efficacy of HDAC1 inhibition in BCCs in vitro, a murine BCC cell line (ASZ) 
resistant to SMO inhibitors but dependent on GLI1  was treated with increasing doses of 
vorinostat, a pan -HDAC inhibitor, and parthenolide, a  HDAC1 -depleting  compound .  Vorinostat 
treatment resulted in a dose -dependent reduction in HH signaling as assayed by [CONTACT_641047]1  
mRNA, a canonica l target gene of the HH pathway  and BCC proliferation ( Figure  1).  Similarly, 
results were seen with partheno lide, a specific  inhibitor of  HDAC1 expression  implicating 
HDAC1 as the critical target of HDAC inhibitors for BCC.

IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 9 of 51  2 October  2020  HDAC inhibitors can suppress  growth of BCC tumor allografts  
BCCs allografts, generated from Ptch1+/- K14-Cre-ER2 p53 fl/fl mice  were injected 
subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice as previously described and allowed to engraft for 
3 weeks  until a consistent 5  mm palpable tumor was visibl e.  100 mg/kg of vorinostat 
administered intraperitoneally twice daily in vivo on the BCC allografts resulted in inhibition of 
GLI1  and completely suppressed tumor growth at 14  days  compared to a 350% growth in tumor 
volume in the placebo .  Skin and organ toxicity was not observed in mice at these dosages .  
(Figure  2).  Altogether, the preliminary data implicates HDAC inhibitors as a promising new 
candidate therapy for BCC .   
 
Figure  2.  (left) Vorinostat suppresses growth of BCC allografts ( blue) as comp ared to placebo  / DMSO

HDAC1 has been previously shown to provide a pi[INVESTIGATOR_641003]1  through 
deacetylation at K518 ( Canettieri,  et al, 2010), su ggesting a potential mechanism of action by 
[CONTACT_641051]1 -inhibition  can suppress HH signaling and suppress BCC . 
Remetinostat is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor  (HDACi) that was designed with a 
metabolically -labile ester bond so that topi[INVESTIGATOR_641004] n would produce effective local histone 
deacetylase  (HDAC) inhibition in cutaneous lesions while resulting in only negligible systemic 
HDAC inhibition.  Remetinostat is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_641005] -100 and 
methylparaben.  Three studies (an  in vitro Franz Diffusion Cell assay ; a 28-day study in 
minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] ; and a 90 -day study in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]) showed that uptake of remetinostat through skin into 
the systemic circulation was minimal .  In both dermal and intravenous  (IV) studies in animals, 
remetinost at was metabolized in the blood rapi[INVESTIGATOR_641006].  These findings 
suggest that dermal application of remetinostat largely obviates systemic exposure to the HDAC 
inhibitor remetinostat and, consequently, sequelae from systemic inhibition o f HDAC.  This 
observation was supported by [CONTACT_641052] a Phase  1 study in patients with cutaneous T -cell 
lymphoma  (CTCL) , plasma concentrations of remetinostat were minimal and at or below the 
lower limit of quantitation of the assay indicating minima l systemic exposure.  The lack of 
measurable levels of remetinostat in blood is consistent with the rapid conversion of 
remetinostat to its metabolites.  
Remetinostat has been tested in a battery of safety pharmacology studies.  Remetinostat did 
not affect the functional observational battery  (FOB) parameters i n rats given IV doses of up 
CONFIDENTIAL:  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 10 of 51  2 October  2020  100 mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to a dose of approximately [ADDRESS_857986].  Remetinostat also did not inhibit human ether à -go-go-related gene  (hERG) cur rent 
in vitro at concentrations up to approximately 32,000  ng/mL and did not affect cardiovascular 
function in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_641007] 100  mg/kg, which is equivalent to a dose of 
approximately 5,[ADDRESS_857987] nervous 
system or cardiovascular system function when administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_641008].  This 
observation has been supported by [CONTACT_641053] a, to date.  
A program of Good Laboratory Practice  (GLP) -compliant toxicity studies evaluated the safety of 
multiple doses of remetinostat  administered IV to rats and administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_641009].  
In addition, the genotoxicity of remetinostat and the  local tolerance and sensitizing potential of 
remetinostat and placebo gel solutions were assessed.  Remetinostat and placebo gel were 
tolerated, with only excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] -related local irritation when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , and renal 
histopathologic changes not rel evant in humans when administered IV.  The [ADDRESS_857988] -Level  (NOAEL) for remetinostat administered IV to rats was 
30 mg/kg/day.  When remetinostat  gel 1.5% was applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_641010], the 28 -day and 
90-day NOAEL of 150  μg/cm2 of skin yielded a total dose of approximately 6  mg/kg.  
Based on these findings, a phase  1 (SHP -141-001) study was conducted ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  in 
18 patients with stage IA -IIA MF-CTCL .  This randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  
dose -escalating  study was designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of remetinostat  gel administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_641011] -daily up to 28  days in 
patients.  Escalating doses of remetinostat gel, 0.1%, 0.5% , and 1%, were administered BID for 
a maximum of 28 days to 3 cohorts of patients (n  = 6 patients pe r cohort, 
active: placebo  ratio 5:1). 
A Phase 2, multicenter, open -label, randomized study (SHP -141-003, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of remetinostat applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_94954] 60 patients with stage IA to 
IIA MF -CTCL was completed in September  2016.  Three doses of remetinostat were evaluated 
in three treatment arms (n  = 20 per treatment arm, 1:1:1 randomi zation).  The 3 dosing 
regimens of remetinostat (1% QD, 0.5% BID and 1% BID) were tested in this study for between 
6 to 12 months . 
All doses and sche dules of remetinostat were well -tolerated.  There were three CTCAE grade 
≥ 3 remetinostat treatment related AEs, with 2/[ADDRESS_857989] dose group of 1% gel BID (2/20 and 6/20 f or the 
1% gel QD and 0.5% gel BID dose groups respecti vely).  There were no remetinostat treatment 
related systemic adverse events reported in either clinical study, which is consistent with the 
minimal systemic exposure and very short half -life of remetinostat in human blood.  
A phase  1 study in patients with  psoriasis resulted in limited efficacy but the safety profile was 
similar to the MF-CTCL studies; no serious adverse events were seen on this study.   
Remetinostat is not  currently approved by [CONTACT_641054], and an  Investigational New Drug 
application ( IND) is required.  The IND number is IND  134521.

such as thos e with basal cell nevus syndrome or extensive chronic sun exposure, essentially all 
of their skin appears to be su sceptible to the development of BCCs, and their quality of life is 
severely degraded by [CONTACT_641055], repetitive surgical procedures (Bree  AF, et al).  
Some patients need to have a dozen or more BCCs treated each year.  T hese procedures are 
time-consuming and expensive, and they inevitably produce scarring.  Exhortations to avoid 
sunlight have minimal effect on slowing the rate of devel opment of BCCs in these patients.  
Hence the patients currently have an endless vista of surgical procedures in their future, with no 
light at the end of the tunnel.  Other patients may have fewer  tumor lesions but they occur in 
cosmetically -disfiguring ar eas or near functional areas where surgery is not ideal.   
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_641012]  (HH) signaling pathway, commonly due to mutational inactivation of the gene 
encoding  the tumor su ppressor, Patched1  (Ptch1).  Ptch1 is a transmembrane receptor for the 
hedgehog ligand and is the key natural inhibitor of HH signaling.  It accomplishes this by 
[CONTACT_641056], GLI.  In 
addition to uniform constitutive activation of the HH pathway, human BCCs also frequently have 
mutations in p53.  
All BCCs have up -regulation of HH signaling due to loss of PTCH1 or activation of SMO 
(Epstein, 2008).  SMO inhibitors replace the functio n of mutant PTCH1 by [CONTACT_641057].  However,  after varying duration, patients may 
find the adverse effects of the drug to be intolerable and may stop taking treatment , leading to 
recurrence of BCC .  Therefo re, a downstream topi[INVESTIGATOR_641013] -tolerated 
because of the expected lack of adverse effects, and inhibition of hedgehog signaling by a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_641014] .  Therefore, as HDAC inhibitors work fur ther 
downstream  to SMO inhibitors to inhibit the HH signaling  pathway, it is hope that remetinostat 
may show efficacy without the adverse effects of SMO inhibitors .

complete the study about 13 weeks  after starting topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l remetinostat treatment  (ie, Screening; 
6 weeks treatment; 4  to 6 weeks follow -up).   
4. TREATMENT PLAN  
Adult subject s in the clinic who have one or more cutaneous  BCCs lesions greater than or equal 
to [ADDRESS_857999] be willing to sign a consent form .  Subjects will also give consent 
to donate their BCC tissue for biomarker measurement and apply medication 3-times daily 
under banda ge occlusion for 6 weeks .  The an ticipated bandage  will be an adhesive bandage 
(eg, “Band -Aid”) with a non -adherent dressing , or paper tape with a non -adherent dressing . 
Drug treatment :  Subjects will be instructed to apply topi[INVESTIGATOR_641020] 
3 times daily for 6 weeks .  Patients will discontinue application of the medicat ion at 6  weeks, 
approximately 2  weeks prior to their surgical excision( s) scheduled for approximately Week  8. 
At least [ADDRESS_858000] of care.  This 
lesion(s) will be measured and photographed  and may be biopsied .  Week 8 biopsy may be 
collected at surgical excision of lesion (s).  Histopathological evaluation of the specimen may be 
performed to evaluate for tumor clearance.  
After an initial treat ment application demonstration by [CONTACT_3476], treatment applications will 
be self -administered  by [CONTACT_28246] a caregiver.  If requested, patient will receive a body map 
which will demonstrate where the lesion is on their body.  This will help the p atient know where 
to apply the treatment drug.  Patients will receive oral and written administration instructions at 
the outset of the trial as follows:  
Study medication is to be applied to dry skin.  Apply the study medication to the BCC lesion(s) 
design ated by [CONTACT_29591], 3  times daily for 6 weeks , using clean, washed finger(s)/ hand as 
applicable .  Cover the treated BCC lesions(s) with a sticky strip  bandage, such as a Band -Aid.  
If you start to treat new lesions or stop treating any lesion, please i nform your physician so a 
record can be kept of which lesions are being treated with study medication.  There is no need 
to leave large amounts of residue on your skin.  If someone else helps apply the study 
medication, they should follow the same instruct ions.  Immediately following application, wipe 
the finger(s) and hands you have used to apply the study drug with a disposable tissue and 
wash your hands using soap and water.  If the study medication gets on the skin of other people

IRB-[ADDRESS_858001].  
Diary: a fter an initial explanation by [CONTACT_641058] , patients will be asked  to fill 
out a medication diary to document application of the study drug (see Appendix  C).  Patients will 
be asked to fill this out daily and to bring their diary with them to each study visit for review by 
[CONTACT_3476].  
Medication Cooler: patients will  be offered a small portable cooler to utilize to keep their study 
drug cold.  
Tumors to be treated will be clearly identified.  Patients will be instructed to store research 
medication in a refrigerator  (see Appendix  B). 
All tumors will be measured and ph otographed at baseline , [ADDRESS_858002]’s electronic medical record system for each of the study visits.  
Given the absen ce of any remetinostat treatment -related systemic AEs, together with the lack of  
effect on laboratory parameters or EKG, the minimal levels of remetinostat detected  
systemically reported in clinical studies to date, and the small BSA (<  0.5%) that will be treated  
with remetinostat gel, no lab assessments will be performed with the exception of a serum  
pregnancy test for women of child -bearing potential at baseline to assess eligibility for  
enrollment.   Eligibility criteria will be used as baseline.  
Patients  may be contact[CONTACT_641059].  Additional 
clinic visit (s) may be scheduled to assess A Es. 
It is anticipated that the entire  target  tumor (s) will be surgically removed at or after the 8th week 
or treatment, is acco rdance with regular medical care.   Patients will apply their last dose of 
Remetinostat 30 mins before surgical excision.   If surgical excision is delayed, ie, does not 
occur at Week  8, the drug may be continued for up to four weeks until surgical excision .  
Between Week 12 and Week 20 , up to three attempts will be made to reach the patient for 
follow up phone call; the patient may also be seen for an in -person visit at the discretion of the 
investigator.   This visit may be in conjunction with surgery , a sur gical follow -up visit , or the visit 
may be conducted by [CONTACT_648].   Patients may be contact[CONTACT_641060].  
BCC tissue s will be collected from those who consent at baseline  and Week  6 to measure the 
biomarker gene for BCCs treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_640995] 1%.  BCC  biopsy will be collected 
in RNA later to measure biomarker s for BCC using real -time PCR.

IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 16 of 51  2 October  2020  4.2 Criteria for Removal from Study  
The trial will be terminated in the event of an SAE (Serious Adverse E vent) related to the 
intervention .  A Serious Adverse Event is any of the following :   
• Fatal ( ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death) .   
• Life threatening ( ie, the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject  at 
immediate risk of death .  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.) .   
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .   
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( ie, the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject ’s ability to conduct normal life functions) .   
• Any occurrence considered by [CONTACT_2418] a significant medical event ( eg, may 
jeopardize the subject  or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
medical outcomes l isted above) .  All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious 
should be regarded as non -serious A Es.   
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event 
to the use of the study drug :   
• Probably -related :  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study 
drug or recurs on re -challenge and another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely .   
• Possibly -related :  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study 
drug and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared the potential 
relationship to study drug .   
• Probably  Not Related :  An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the 
study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
• Not Related :  An adverse even is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of 
another drug and is not related to the study drug.  
Subjects may be removed from the study because of subject wishes, non -compliance, or 
development of any medical cond ition that puts the subject at increased risk, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046].   
The investigator has the right to discontinue a patient from study drug or withdraw a patient from 
the study at any time.   In addition, patients have the right to voluntar ily discontinue study drug or 
withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  Reasons for discontinuation of study drug 
or withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Any subject who presents at screening or during t reatment with a large ( > 25 mm) BCC 
lesion will be discontinued from treatment (if  applicable) and referred for evaluation for 
surgical resection.  
• Subject withdrawal of consent at any time  
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines  may jeopardize the 
patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study  
• Investigator determines it is in the best interest of the patient

7. ADVERSE EVENTS AN D REPORTING PROCEDURES  
7.1 Potential Adverse Events  
Slight irritation of the skin was observed in some animal studies and was likely related to the 
ethanol in the formulation.   
Escalating doses of remetinostat gel were administered to different cohorts of  patients to assess 
safety and tolerability in a Phase 1 study in patients with CTCL.  A total of 18 patients with 
CTCL were sequentially enrolled into one of three study cohorts consisting of six patients each.  
Within each study cohort of six patients, 5  were randomly assigned to receive remetinostat gel 
and 1 was randomly assigned to receive placebo.  Patients received treatment for a maximum 
of 28 days.  Three dose levels of remetinostat gel were evaluated at 0.1%, 0.5% and 1%.

topi[INVESTIGATOR_641026].  Ten of the treatment -related 
adverse events were mild (Grade 1) and one event (contact [CONTACT_8748]) was Grade  2.  Only the 
Grade  [ADDRESS_858007] dermatitis required treatment, for which topi[INVESTIGATOR_641027] 28 -day course of remetinostat gel treatment, which 
resolved.  All treatment -related adverse event s had resolved prior to the Day  42 End -of-Study 
visit. 
There were no hematological findin gs among the 18 treated patients.  Among the 5 clinical 
laboratory changes reported as adverse events and the 4 clinical laboratory values that reached 
≥ Grade  2, none was related to study drug administration.  
For the phase  2 study , 60 patients were random ised in a 1:1 :1 ratio to three treatment regimens 
of remetinostat gel (1% QD, 0.5%  BID and 1% BID). Patients received t reatment for 6  months 
and could continue on treatment for a further six months (12  months in total) if they received 
clinical benefit dur ing the first 6 -month period.  
Remetinostat gel at dosing regimens of 1% QD, 0.5% BID and 1% BID was generally 
well-tolerated, with no reports of adverse events associated with systemic HDAC inhibitors.  
There were 2 SAEs (acute heart failure and fracture),  observed during the study considered 
unrelated to treatment with remetinostat.  
The most common adverse events were pruritus and skin irritation.   
Approximately half of the patients in each group reported A Es con sidered related to treatment; 
4 of these me t CTCAE grade ≥  3 for severity and all were skin -related: The rate of 
discontinuations due to treatment -related A Es was low, with no indication of a higher rate in the 
highest ( 1% BID) dose group.  Overall, the patients who had dose reduction/interruptions  due to 
remetinostat related skin A Es in the 1% BID dose group stayed on treatment for a long time. 
The CTC grade 3 events resolved, patients wanted to stay on treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_641028] A Es 
(except for a single patient) and most of the patients (4  of 6) in t his highest dose group who 
remained on drug for >  6 months received benefit, in terms of objective CAILS and/or pruritus 
responses.  
In the current study, skin will be carefully evaluated during treatment.

No systemic abnormalities were found at any dose level in the nonclinical studies and no 
treatment -related observations other than those above were noted in any clinical trial.  T hus, no 
special precautions are anticipated.  
The effect of remetinostat  in pregnancy has not been studied.  Similarly, excretion of 
remetinostat  into breast milk has not been examined.  Therefore, pregnant and lactating women 
are excluded from clinical tri als at this time.  
Remetinostat  is considered unlikely to be a photo -irritant as SHP -141 ab sorbs light at a 
maximum of 234  nm in the UV/visible spectrum and does not meaningfully absorb light above 
290 nm.  Photo -irritation has not been observed in clinical  trials of remetinostat  gel.

12.6 Secondary Analysis   
12.6.1 Secondary Objective Measure :  Reduction in GLI1 expression  
Secondary Objective  [ADDRESS_858027] 50% to have a 
clinically -significant anti -BCC effect in subje cts.  This will provide insight into whether 
remetinostat is an effective chemotherapeutic for BCC.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurement Definition  
This study will measure GLI1 mRNA, representing Hedgehog target gene (GLI1) expression, in 
samples of BCC tumors using real -time QPCR.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Population  
The analysis population for this objective is planned to include  at least  [ADDRESS_858028]-treatment BCC biopsies ( “paired  BCC tumor  samples”).  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 28 of 51  2 October  2020  [IP_ADDRESS] Measurement Methods  
HH target gene (GLI1) expression in BCCs will be measured using real -time PCR.  Biopsies of 
BCC tu mors will be placed in RNAlater  and stored at -80°C prior to analysis.  Total RNA will be 
isolated from the collected BCCs using a RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini  Kit 
(Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA) according to the manufacture’s protocol.  The RNA obtained will then be 
quantified using A260/A280 spectrophotometry.  DNase treated RNA (2  µg) will reverse 
transcribed u sing the High Capacity RNA -to-cDNA kit (Like  Technologies, Grand  Island, 
[LOCATION_001]).  The obtained cDNA will be used in 20  µL PCR reactions containing 10  µL Maxima 
SYBR Green qPCR Master Mixes (Thermo  Scientific, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_106735],  Pennsylvania ) 0.4 µL primers, 
0.86 µL of cDNA template sample, and 8.74  µL of molecular grade water.  Reactions will be 
performed in 284 -well PCR plates and read on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection 
System.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Plan  
Post-treatment GLI1 mRNA levels in the  paired BCC sa mple sets will be compared with 
baseline GLI1 levels  for the respective subject  to calculate percent change in GLI1 mRNA 
expression.  Because GLI levels are not expected to be normally  distributed, the  compar ison will 
be conducted using the using Wilcoxon signed rank test.  
Data will be analyzed using the comparative CT method as a means of relative quantitation, 
normalized to an endogenous reference (HPRT cDNA) and relative to a calibrator (normalized 
Ct value obtained from controls) and expressed as the 2 -∆∆Ct  algorithm (also known as the 
delta -delta -Ct or ddCt  algorithm) a ccording to Applied Biosystems User Bulletin  2:  Rev  B, 
“Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression.”  
With a sample size of at least [ADDRESS_858029]  greater  than 98% power to 
detect  a 43% (SD:  30%)  decrease  in GLI1  mRNA  levels  at 2-sided  alpha  level 0.05 assuming 
no change in GLI mRNA levels w ithout remetinostat (effect  size = 1.0, Wilcoxon  signed 
rank test).  This should provide sufficient power to determine whether top ical remetinostat can 
block the hedgehog pathway in humans to the degree required to be an effective 
chemotherapeutic.  
12.6.2 Secondary Objective Measure :  Safety  
For Secondary Objective  1, toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Instit ute 
CTCAE v 5.0.  The safety of remetinostat when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_116389] 6 weeks will be assess a s 
follows:  
• Incidence, type, and severity of adverse events  (AEs)  
• Incidence and nature of serious adverse events  (SAEs)  
• Incidence of AEs leading to remetinostat  discontinuation or interruption  
• Adherence to the treatment, measured by [CONTACT_641074] 
(for any reason) and treatment interruptions  
 
IRB-[ADDRESS_858030] s will be enrolled from Stanfor d Dermatology (Adult) clinic which sees approximately 
4,000 dermatology patients per month (or 48,000 visits per year) .  Approximately 20% of these 
patients have current or past skin cancer .  Enrollment  of BCC subject s for Stanford  clinical trials  
has been  rapid .  We anticipate to be able to enroll [ADDRESS_858031] -treatmen t biopsies .   
12.7.2 Sample size justification  
For primary  objective  analysis,  with a planned  analysis  on 30 BCCs , this study  would  provide  
91% power  to reject  an ORR  of 15% if the true ORR  is 40% or better,  at one-sided  alpha  level 
of 0.[ADDRESS_858032] a 43 % decrease in G LI mRNA levels (SD :  30%) with 98 % power at a two -sided alpha 
level of 0.05 assuming no change in GLI levels without remet inostat (effect size  = 1.0, Wilcoxon 
signed rank test)  
12.7.[ADDRESS_858033] size justification  
This is a si ngle-arm (non -randomized) study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_641035] .  BCCs are not anticipated 
to self-regress in the absence of any treatment.  
12.8 Criteria for future  studies  
If topi[INVESTIGATOR_641036], it is anticipated that a larger, randomized, controlled 
trial will be propose d.

Remetinostat Information Sheet  
Remetinostat Application instructions:  
Remetinostat  gel 1% is to be applied to dry skin.  Wash your hands and s queeze the amount of 
study me dication that was demonstrated by [CONTACT_641077], 
and apply t o the BCC  lesion (s) identified by [CONTACT_29591] .  Apply to the BCC lesion (s) 3 times 
daily for 6 weeks as specified by [CONTACT_29591].  Cover the treated BCC lesions(s) with a sticky 
strip bandage, such as a Band -Aid.   
There is no need to leave large amounts of residue on your skin. Immediately following 
application, wipe the finger(s) and hands you have used to apply the study drug with a 
disposable tissue an d wash your hands using soap and water. If the study medication gets on 
the skin of other people they should wash with soap and water.  
If someone else helps apply the study medication, they should follow the same instructions.   
If you start to treat new le sions or stop treating any lesion, please inform your physician so a 
record can be kept of which lesions are being treated with study medication.  
Remetinostat Storage Instruction s:  
• Do not store the study medication in your car.  
• Study medication should be  stored in the refrigerator , away from heat or open flame.  
• The study medication should be kept out of reach of children and unauthorized persons 
(not being patients participating in this study or their caregiver).   
Risks from Remetinostat : 
In prior studie s, remetinostat caused some people to have some skin irritation such as a tingling 
or tickling feeling (“pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]”) on their skin, a warm or burning feeling on their skin or 
inflammation (redness and swelling).  
This may be due to the ingredients t he drug is mixed in, or the drug itself.

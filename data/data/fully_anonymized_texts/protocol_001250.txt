INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH STUDIES  
 
A research study is designed to answer specific questions, sometimes about a drug’s or device’s safety and 
effectiveness.  Being in a re search study is different from being a patient.  When you are a patient, you and your 
doctor have a great deal of freedom in making decisions about your health care.  When you are a research 
participant, the Protocol Director and the research staff will fo llow the rules of the research study (protocol) as 
closely as possible, without compromising your health.  
 
PURPOSE OF RESEARCH  
 
You and your child are invited to participate in a research s tudy of t wo treatment conditions  for children and 
adolescents who h ave gone through traumatic experiences and develop symptoms after those experiences.  In 
general terms, this condi tion is known as Posttraumatic Stress D isorder (PTSD). We hope to learn which 
treatment is most effective for which youth and to identify whic h components of treatment are most effective .  
As a caregiver, we are asking you to be an active participant in the treatment.  Your child is being selected as a 
possible participant in this study because you have responded to a flyer that was either poste d or distributed in a 
public space , through a community organization, youth center  or from a physician  or clinician. . 
 
This research study is looking for [ADDRESS_960013] Youth Solutions  site in

Your and your child’s participation in this study is entirely voluntary. If your child decides not t o participate, 
you are free to withdraw your consent, including your authorization regarding the use and disclosure of your 
health information, and to discontinue participation at any time without prejudice to you or effect on your

DURATION OF STUDY INVOLVEMENT  
  
This research study i s expected to last four years . Your child will  actively participate during 3-4 months;  in 
which he/she will take part in a [ADDRESS_960014] each week for 15 therapy sessions. As 
the child’s caregiver, you will be asked to volunteer to participate in approximately [ADDRESS_960015]. Victor Carrion and his research study staff enrolling you 
and your child in a treatment trial . Your child will be randomly assigned to one of t wo treatment conditions: 
Cue-Centered Treatment  or Trauma -Focused Cognitiv e Behavioral Therapy. Your child’s treatment will be 
provided by a Stanford University therapi[INVESTIGATOR_706613].  Your child will begin 
treatment immediately with weekly [ADDRESS_960016] effective in reducing 
psychological, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms . 
 
As the child’s caregiver, you will be asked to volunteer to participate in approximat ely 3 -15 of the 15 sessions , 
depending on which treatment group the participant is assigned to .  The sessions should take approximately 3 -4 
months to complete (1 6 weeks; approximately 45 minutes for each session). At the end of treatment your child’s

Trauma -Focused Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy:  This is an evidence -based, short -term treatment that involves 
both individual child sessions as well as joint par ent-child sessions. The specific components of treatment 
include: 1)psychoeducation about the impact of trauma and common trauma reactions, 2) parenting skills to 
optimize your child’s emotional and behavioral adjustment, 3) copi[INVESTIGATOR_706617] s individualized to 
the child and parent, 4) helpi[INVESTIGATOR_706618] a range of emotions, 5) cognitive processing 
to help the child modify unhelpful or inaccurate thoughts about the trauma, 6) trauma narration in which the 
child describes  his/her traumatic experiences, 7) exposure to traumatic reminders to help your child overcome 
avoidance of situations that may be reminding him/her of the trauma, 8)  parent -child sessions to facilitate

communication between the caregiver and child about the traumatic experiences, and 9) enhancing future safety 
and consolidation of skills learned.  
 
Cue-Centered Treatment:   This is an evidence -based, short term -treatment that involves both individual child 
sessions as well as joint parent -child sessions. It is a multi -modal approach combining elements from cognitive, 
behavioral, psychodynamic, expressive, and family therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . There are several unique components to Cue -
Centered Treatment that distinguish it from Trauma -Focused Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy. First, the treatment 
supplements the trauma narrative with use of a lifeline to examine both circumscribed traumatic event s as well 
as other daily of life stressors. Additionally, Cue-Centered Treatment has several sessions focusing on teaching 
youth and their caregivers about the conditioning process that occurs through repeated exposure to trauma. 
Furthermore, the treatment  is more insight oriented compared to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy to help 
the child link trauma history, emotions and cognitions  while placing current behaviors in an empathic context. 
Finally, in addition to using emotional, cognitive, and be havioral approaches to develop new responses, the 
treatment also includes a physiological approach.   
 
 
We will ask you and your child to complete assessments at four time points (prior to treatment, during 
treatment, post treatment and at 3 month follow -up). These assessments include questionnaires and interviews 
about mood, thoughts and behavior.  You may choose not to answer any question s you do not wish to answer in 
any of the assessments.  It is possible that, based on information gained from thi s study, the investigators may 
have serious concerns (relating to matters such as severe depression, physical abuse, etc.) about you  or your 
child’s  health and/or safety; in such a case, the investigators may contact [CONTACT_706628] a referral for 
addition al care.  
 
In addition to the assessments, your child will have the option to participate in neuroimagin g. The purpose is to 
examine whether imaging findings are predictors of better treatment outcome. We are using functional Near 
Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine the effects of trauma on  the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866]. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_706619] 90 minutes, an d includes a series of self and parent report questionnaires followed by a 30 minute NIRS 
scan. fNIRS is a non -invasive, neuroimaging technique. Children wear a cap with light emitting and receiving 
probes while completing a series of tasks on a computer.  The cap may cause slight discomfort for some 
children. If your child becomes upset by [CONTACT_706629]. Given that 
these assessments can take up to two hours to complete, you and your child may become tired, bored, or 
uncomfortable. Every effort will be made to help reduce discomfort for you and your child including offering 
breaks and spacing out the initial assessment over two separate time points.

abuse) , suspected elder abuse or neglect, or intent to harm yourself or others. In the event that you  or your child  
tell the research staff that you are thinking about killing yourself or answer yes to a question about having 
thoughts about suicide, the research  staff will ask you more questions about the thoughts. Depending on how 
intense you  or your child’s  thoughts are or how much you  or your child  feel like hurting yourself, the research 
staff may provide you  or your child  with referrals for treatment, work w ith you  or your child  to contact [CONTACT_706631], trusted family member, or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_706623]’s  thoughts of harming 
yourself; or work with you  or your child  on a plan that may include getting you  or your child  to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_706624].  
 
Subject information may be provided to Federal and regulatory agencies as required. If information is revealed 
about child abuse or neglect, elder abuse or neglect, or potentially dangerous future behavior to others or

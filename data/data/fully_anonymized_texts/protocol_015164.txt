The analy sis will include all dosed patients and will 
be summarised descriptively.
The measures of interest will proportion of patients 
reporting different levels of each symptomatic AEs 
and proportion of patients reporting different levels of 
overall side effect burden at each time point.
• To estimate the effectiveness of module -defined 
study treatment by [CONTACT_415500] h

Statistical Methods
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_244979], including contract research 
organisat ions (CROs). A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and 
will describe the patient populat ions to be included in th e analyses, the analyses including any  
subgroup analyses or sensit ivity analyses, and the procedures to account for missing, unused, 
and spurious data.
Each Cohort will be analysed separately.
The analysis of object ive res ponse rate (ORR) will be performed according to the 
Lugano 2014 Classificat ion for NHL  
(Cheson et al 2014 ) as assessed by [CONTACT_415502] (BICR). Object ive response ra te will be defined as response of CR or PR.
The efficacy endpo ints for tumour response (ORR, duration of response [DoR] and time to 
objective response [TTR]) will be summarised and analysed based on the response evaluable 
analysis set. The efficacy endpo ints for overall survival (OS), progression -free survival (PFS), 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.[ADDRESS_523678] subsequent therapy  or death (TFST), and qualit y of life (QoL) will be summarised

this disease ( Howlader et al  2020 ).
AKT is a node of mult iple signalling pathways promot ing tumorigenesis, inhibit ing apoptosis, 
impact ing the cell cycle, and promoting invasio n and migrat ion. Capi[INVESTIGATOR_415299] (AZD5363) is a 
poten t, select ive inhibitor of the kinase act ivity of all 3isoforms of AKT (AKT1, AKT2, and 
AKT3) that is administered orally  on an intermi ttent schedule of administration. An est imated 
900patients wi th solid tum ours have received capi[INVESTIGATOR_415318], 
as monotherapy  or in combinat ion with other anti -cancer agents (refer to the current 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_415319]) showing a manageable safet y profile and promising efficacy data. 
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_415320] a different node on the PI3K -AKT -TOR signal ling pathway to the 
established PI3K inhibitors that have proven efficacy in lympho ma (and current ly approved 
for R/R FL) and has shown already promising efficacy  data in soli d tum ours.
Limited preclinical models are available for studying the effect of ca pi[INVESTIGATOR_415321]. In an extended cell panel, capi[INVESTIGATOR_415322] y in lympho ma lines representative of MCL  and DLBCL  at a 
concentration less than 1 µM ( Lync h et al  2016 ). In vitro, capi[INVESTIGATOR_415323]. It shows 100% tumour growth inhibit ion in 2 out 
of 7MCL  cell lines (Granta -519, JVM -2) at 3 µM and 50% inhibit ion in a further 3 cell lines 
at 3µM (Mino, Jeko, Z -138). In addit ion, capi[INVESTIGATOR_415324] 30% tumour growth

For these reasons, capi[INVESTIGATOR_415325] a novel attractive therapeutic option for the

2.2 Background
2.2.1 Role of AKT Inhibition in B-cell Lymphoid Malignancies
The PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway  is frequent ly deregulated in cancers and drives tumour grow th 
and cell survival. All 3 AKT isoforms are activated in t ypes o f solid tum ours (breast, prostate,

Capi[INVESTIGATOR_415296] -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 25of 185ovari an, pancreat ic, gastric cancers) and in haematological malignancies. This act ivation is 
often associated with resistance to established cancer therapie s as well as advanced disease 
and/or poor prognosis. AKT act ivation in tumours is largely due to input fro m other si gnalling 
pathways upstream of AKT (eg, mutation of oncogenes such as Ras, Bcr -abl, mutation of 
receptor ty rosine kinases such as epit helial growth factor receptor , amplificati on of  HER2, 
loss of PTEN funct ion, and mutations o f PI3K).
Inhibit ion of PI3K, AKT or mTOR kinases have been shown to confer anti -proliferat ive effect 
and apoptosis in a variet y of lympho ma types in vitro ( Georgakis and Y ounes 2006 ; Jia et al  
2008 ; Yuan and Cant ley 2008 ; Engelman 2009 ). Several PI3K inhibitors (ie, idelalisib, 
duvelisib, copanlisib) have been already approved for the treatment of R/R FL  (ZYDELIG 
USPI ; COPI[INVESTIGATOR_415326]; ALIQOP AUSPI ).
Phosphorylat ion of AKT represents PI3K pathway activat ion, and is commo n in lympho mas. 
Hodgkin lympho ma co mmo nly dem onstrates AKT phosphorylation in cell lines and in 63% of 
tumour bi opsies (Georgakis et al 2006 ). In D LBCL, phosphorylation o f AKT is co mmo n (52% 
to 72% of patient samples) and might be associated with inferior survival (Uddin et al  2006 ). 
Mantle cell ly mphoma demonstrates variable levels of AKT phosphorylat ion, although the 
aggressive blastoid subt ype appears to require constitutive AKT activation for survival 
(Rudelius et al 2006 ). Follicular lympho ma shows AKT signalling pathway act ivation, due to 
either AKT phosphorylat ion or PTEN downregulatio n, in the absence of PIK3CA  mutations 
(Yahiaoui  et al  2014 ).
Several studies have demo nstrated that a decrease in AKT activit y by [CONTACT_415504] a reducti on in tum our cell  proliferati on. AKT inhibitors entering clinical 
development include ipatasert ib (RG7440), afuresertib ([COMPANY_004]2110183), uprosertib 
([COMPANY_004]2141795), which, like capi[INVESTIGATOR_415296], bind to the adenosine triphosphate active site and 
inhibit AKT act ivity, thus exerting cy totoxi c and ant iproliferat ive activit ies against human 
cance r cells. Allosteric inhibitors of AKT have also been studied. Perifosine, MK -[ADDRESS_523682] ivity through the suppressio n of cell growth mediated by [CONTACT_415505] ( Brown and Banerji 2017). However, 
limited clinical data are available wit h AKT inhibitors in lympho ma.
Perifosine is a first -generat ion AKT inhibitor that funct ions via inhibi tion of AKT 
transl ocati on to the cell membrane ( Kondapaka et al 2003 ). Com bined in a phase II trial wit h 
the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, perifosine had an ORR o f 28% in relapsed Hodgkin 
lympho ma (Guidetti et al  2014 ).
A second -generati on AKT inhibitor, MK -[ADDRESS_523683] 
AKT1 and AKT2 and has shown strong preclinical activit y in a variet y of lympho ma cell lines 
as single agent and in co mbinat ions wit h other agents ( Hirai et al 2010 ; Li et al  2012 ).

important potential risk of

No association between 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_415331], involving 
887patients in advanced solid 
tumour indications (as of 
04Oct2020).Within the capi[INVESTIGATOR_415332] -
clinical programme, effects on the 
haematopoietic system were noted 
in rats, with a related decrease in 
white cells in males. The changes 
were primarily noted at 
100mg/kg/day dose in males. In 
the 6 month study decreased 
cellularity was noted in the thymus 
and bone marrow of males at 
100mg/kg/day and females 
150mg/kg/day. Changes were 
reversible with the exception of 
bone marrow effects. In the dog 
only the thy mus was affected and 
was fully reversible.Due to the target population of 
CAPI[INVESTIGATOR_200160], and their potential 
predisposition to cytopenia, either 
through disease manifestat ion, or 
prior anti -cancer treatments, 
haematological parameters will be 
closely  monito red at regular 
intervals as specified in the 
schedule of assessments in the 
protocol.
Haematological toxicity -specific 
toxicity management guidelines 
will be included in the protocol to 
support the Investigator in the 
clinical management of any such 
adverse drug reactions secondary 
to capi[INVESTIGATOR_415296]. 
Additionally, enrolled patients will 
have been screened for adequate 
bone marrow function prior to 
commencing capi[INVESTIGATOR_415333].
The em erging clinical safet y profile fro m the early  clinical studies have not ident ified risks 
that woul d precl ude invest igation in this setting. Second, the protocol includes ongoing safet y 
monitoring in exce ss of standard of care monitoring, with the intent of protecting pat ients 
involved in the study . Furthermore, dose m odificati on strategy  for management of 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_415299]-related toxici ty and m onitoring is in place for those risks deemed to be most 
likely  or serious. Thus, based upon the clinical and non -clinical safet y profile, and the strength 
of the sci entific hypothesis under evaluation, the benefit/risk assessment for this study  
supports the administration of capi[INVESTIGATOR_415334] R/R B -cell NHL.

advanced AKT1 mutant solid tumours in monotherapy or combinat ion with fulvestrant (ER +

These potential benefit s warrant investigation wit h capi[INVESTIGATOR_415338] R/R NHL  settings and there is a clear 
unmet clinical need in this populat ion failing or not being eligible or not having available 
approved treatment options.
2.3.3 Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion
While several treatments have been approved for patients with R/R B -cell NHL, none of them 
currently o ffer a cure to these patients. Therefore, although monotherapy capi[INVESTIGATOR_415339], based on the pre -clinical data available, capi[INVESTIGATOR_415340] R/R B -cell NHL  setting does allow the opportunit y to assess its act ivity as monotherapy  
while offering the patient a reasonable chance of achieving an objective response to the 
treatm ent.
Taking into account the measures taken to minimise risk to patients participat ing in this study , 
the potenti al risks ident ified in associat ion with capi[INVESTIGATOR_415341] t may be afforded to patients with R/R B- cell NHL. Capi[INVESTIGATOR_415342]; therefore, this clinical trial will provide the first clinical 
safet y and efficacy  data for capi[INVESTIGATOR_415343].

(28.6%; N = 8) were suspected to have acquired the infection by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated 
transmissio n (Yu et al  2020 , Zhang et al 2020). Patients with cancer may have a higher risk 
from COVID -19 than individuals without c ancer but current evidence appears insufficient to 
support a conclusive associat ion between cancer in general and COVID -19 (Kumar et al  2019 , 
Xia et al  2020 ).

with their usual and/or preferred lifestyle; this must continue for the total duration of the study treatment 
and for at least 4 weeks (for female pati ents) or at least 16 weeks (for male patients) after the last dose of 
study treatment. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation methods, or 
declaration of abstinence solely for the duration of a trial) and withdrawal are n ot acceptable methods of 
contraception.
• Vasectomised sexual partner (with patient assurance that partner received post -vasectomy confirmation 
of azoospermia) combined with a barrier method.
• Bilateral tubal occlusion combined with a barrier method. 
• Intrauterine device (provided coils are copper banded) combined with a barrier method.
Acceptable hormonal methods:
• Mini pi[INVESTIGATOR_415357] a barrier method: Progesterone -based oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_72908].

All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_415535] : ‘Have y ou had any heal th probl ems since the previous visit/y ou were 
last asked? ’, or revealed by [CONTACT_122614] . When 
collect ing AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.
8.3.5 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests
The r esults from the CSP -mandated laboratory  tests, vi tal signs, physical examinat ions, ECGs, 
and ECHO/MUGA  scans will  be summarised in the CSR. 
Deteri oration as com pared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  values, vital signs,

non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study  treatment, eg, dose 
adjustm ent or drug interruption).
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion. Wherever possible the reporting invest igator 
uses the clinica l, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglo bin value). 
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, whi ch is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless uneq uivocally 
related to the disease under study .

10.3 Background –Module 1
10.3.1 Cohort 1A –Therapeutic Options for R/R Follicular Lymphoma
Follicular lympho ma is the most frequent subt ype of indo lent NHL  and accounts for 
approximately  20% of  all NHLs. This histology  is further divided into 3 different grades 
(Grades 1 to 3) reflect ing the heterogeneit y in the bio logy of the di sease. Although median OS 
is >15years, FL  remains an incurable disease in most of the patients exhibit ing a rel apsing 
and remitt ing pattern. Median PFS progressively shorten over time wit h each subsequent line 
of therapy  beyond the first (eg, 18, 9.6, 8.[ADDRESS_523775], fourth, and 
≥fifth lines of therapy respectively), highlight ing a clear unmet need for R/R patients ( Link et 
al 2019 ).
The m anage ment of R/R disease include ant i-CD20 based chemo -immunotherapy , autol ogous 
HSCT and chemo -free opti ons such co mbinat ion of lenalido mide and rituximab, PI3K 
inhibitors, and tazemetostat. Three PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib, duvelisib, copanlisib) have 
been a pproved for use in the US (only 1 in Europe, idelalisib) in FL  that relapsed after at least 
2prior sy stemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_415382]- arm, Phase II studies. In idelalisib -treated FL  
patients, ORR was 56%, while median PFS was 1 1.0months (Salles et al  2018 ). In copanlisib -
treated FL  patients, ORR was 59% and median DoR was 12.2 months (ALIQOP A USPI ). In 
duvelisib -treated FL  patients, ORR was 42% (CR 1%), and median DoR was 10 months 
(Flinn et al 2019 ). However, the associated safet y profile (in particular, life -threatening 
infect ions, pneumo nitis, transaminit is, co litis) together with their schedule of administration 
(eg, IV use for copanl isib) often hampers their extensive use in clinical pract ice. Recent ly, the 
EZH inhibitor tazemetostat has been approved based on an open -label Phase II trial. In 
patients wi th EZH2m ut disease, ORR was 69% with a median DoR of 10.9 months and a 
median PFS of 13.8 months. In patients with wild -type EZH2, the ORR was 35%, median 
DoR was 13 months and median PFS was 11.1 months (Morschhauser et al 2020 ).
10.3.2 Coho rt 1B –Therapeutic Options for R/R Marginal Zone Lymphoma
Marginal zone lympho mas represent the second most commo n subt ype of indo lent lymphoma 
accounting for 5 -15% of NHL, although individually the 3 variants –nodal  MZL, spl enic 
MZL  and extranodal  MZL  of mucosa -associ ated lymphoi d tissue lympho ma (Sehn 2016 ). For 
patients wi th MZL  relapsing disease after at least one CD20- based FDA -approved 
chemotherap y-free opti ons include the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib (approved in MZL  on the basis 
of Study  1121, a phase II trial showing ORR of 46%, CR of 3% [ IMBRUVICA  USPI ]) and 
combinat ion of lenalidomide and rituximab for patients after > 1line of treatment of

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 96of 185lenalido mide ( REVLIMID Sm PC). However, in a post -hoc a nalysis in MZL  subset, despi [INVESTIGATOR_415383]  (64% 
vs 44%) no PFS improvement was observed in this cohort compared to other histologies 
(Leonard et al 2019).
10.3.3 Cohort 1C –Therapeutic Options for R/R Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Mantle cell lymphoma is considered an aggressive lympho ma representing 5% to 7% of NHL  
and it ’s defined by [CONTACT_415544] (1 1;14)(q13;q32) and result ing in const itutive 
overexpressio n of cyclin D1. PI3K -dependent AKT activat ion leads to inhibit ion of glycogen 
synthase kinase 3β, which, when activated, phosphorylates cy clin D1, tri ggering i ts nuclear 
export and proteasomal degradat ion (VanArsdale et al 2015). Consti tutive act ivation of PI3K 
in MCL  alters CD1d -mediated ant igen processing and presentation, ult imately result ing in 
decreased ant i-tumour NKT cell responses. MCL  is a heterogeneous disease wit h variable 
presentations, clinical and bio logic ri sk factors, and treatment approaches. ( Maddocks 2018) 
that often respond well in the front line setting with combination chemotherapy , although the 
responses are often not durable with a median PFS after second, third, fourth, and ≥ fifth lines 
of therapy  of 14, 6.5 , 5, and 3.3 months, respectively ( Kumar et al  2019 ). Treatment options 
for R/R MCL  include the BTK inhibitors ibrutinib and acalabrut inib; bortezomib, 
lenalido mide with or without rituximab, and brexucabtagene autoleucel ( IMBRUVICA  USPI ; 
CALQUENCE USPI ; VELCADE USPI ; REVLIMID USPI ;TECAR TUS USPI ). Although the 
response rates with single -agent BTK inhibitors are relatively high, approximately  one- third 
of patients di splay  primary resistance to BTK inhibitors, and nearly all patients eventually  
progress. The outcomes of pat ients who progress following BTK inhibitors are relat ively poor 
with an ORR ranging between 25% and 42% and median OS betwee n 6 and 10 months with 
salvage therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Martin et al 2016 ; Epperla et al 2009 ; Jain et al  2018 ).
Recent ly, brexucabtagene autol eucel, a CD19- directed CAR -T therapy  has been approved for 
R/R MCL  failing ≥ 2 lines of systemic therapy including a BTK inhibitor, showing an ORR of 
85% and a 12 -month PFS and OS of 61% and 83%, respectively  (Wang et al 2020).
Promising data from CAR -T therapi [INVESTIGATOR_415384] -specifics ant ibody  have also recent ly emerged in 
the landscape of indo lent and aggressive lymphomas. However, toxicit ies related to fatal cases 
of cytokine release syndrome / neurotoxicit y and costs shoul d be taken into account in the 
treatm ent choice for R/R patients in future. In particular, for older patients and for those with 
co-morbidities that preclude aggressive treatment and for whom dependence on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_415385] a signifi cant challenge, are likely  to benefi t greatly  from oral 
monotherapy  (Flinn et al  2019 ).

12.1 Justific ation for Dose
Oral capi[INVESTIGATOR_415299] 480 mg BD given intermittent ly (4days on/3 days off) is the recommended 
Phase II dose regimen for monotherapy . This corresponds to the maximum tolerated dose.
Although in the dose -escalation Phase I study  (Banerji et al 2018 ) in pat ients with solid 
tumours, capi[INVESTIGATOR_415296] 480 mg BD given intermittent ly (4days on/3 days off) was defined as 
the maximum tolerated dose for the intermittent schedule 4 days on/[ADDRESS_523780] ion of 
recommended Phase 2 dose for monotherapy  trials, including CAPIT AL, considered not only  
safet y and l ong-term tolerabili ty, but al so evidence of target engagement and PK/PD 
relationships. 
Following assessment of the mult iple dosing regimens explored (either continuous or 
intermittent schedules), capi[INVESTIGATOR_415296] 480 mg BD given intermittent ly (4 days on/3 days off)
was considered the optimal balance between tolerabilit y and efficacy . Refer to the current 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_415392].
The fo llowing evidences support the cho ice of the starting dose in the CAPIT ALstudy  and 
provi de a j ustificat ion of the selected intermittent schedule .

B [ADDRESS_523805] a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the m edicinal product. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
B 2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is an AE occurring during any  study  Phase (ie, run- in, treatment, washout, follow -
up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing criteria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72916]
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Adverse Events for malignant tumours reported during a study  shoul d generally be assessed 
as SAEs . If no other seri ousness criteria apply , the ‘Important Medi cal Event ’ criterion shoul d 
be used. In certain situat ions, howe ver, medical judgem ent on an individual event basis should 
be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should be assessed and reported as a 
non-serious AE. For example, if the tumour is included as medical history  and progressi on 
occurs duri ng th e study , but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumour, the AE m ay not fulfil the attributes for being assessed as serious, although 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumour as an AE is valid and should occur . Also, 
some ty pes of  malignant tum ours, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913], may be assessed as non -serious; examples in adult s include

Life-threatening
‘Life-threatening ’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or co ntinued use of the product would result in the patient ’s 
death. ‘Life-threatening ’ does not m ean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_415409], although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or dis ease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study , provi ded that i t did not deteri orate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment
Medical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situat ions 
where important medical events may  not be immedi ately life threatening or result in death, 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72913], disabilit y or incapaci ty but may  jeopardi se the patient or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious. These should 
usually be considered as serious.

judgement must be used.

Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 118of 185Intensity Rating Scale:
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE v5 will be utilised for all events with an 
assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the 
recommendat ion in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate and severe events into 
CTCAE grades should be used. A  copy  of the CTCAE can be downloaded fro m the Cancer 
Therapy  Evaluat ion Program website (http://ctep.cancer .gov). The applicable versio n of 
CTCAE shoul dbe described clearly .
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_73010] B 2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it sat isfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix B 2.
B 3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administrati on of  the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_122570]?
No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_415563] e, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally reco mmend or support a re-
challenge .
Laboratory  tests. A speci fic laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 119of 185Is this a recogni sedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related ’ is made iffollowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal  relati onship is meant to convey , in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgement. W ith no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relat ionship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not rel ated’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
B 4 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical stu dy a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  treatm ent that ei ther causes harm to the patient 
or has the potential to cause harm to the patient. 
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy of t he drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or pati ent.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error . 
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the patient received the drug
Did not occur, but ci rcumstances were recognised that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the pati ent
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature

Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in cli nical studi es:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IRT/RTSM -including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
Patient acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medicat ion
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124of 185Collection of Samples for Genetic Research
  
Although DNA is stable, early  sampl e collect ion is preferred to avoid 
introducing bias through excluding pat ients who may  withdraw due to an AE. Only one 
sample should be co llected per patient for genetics during the study.
Coding and Storage of DNA Sampl es
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are 
important to maintain pat ient confident iality. Sampl es will  be stored for a m aximum  of 
15years, from the date of last patient last visit, after which they will be dest royed. DNA 
is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until 
no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached.
An addit ional second code will be assigned to the sample eit her before or at the time of 
DNA extraction replacing the informat ion on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will 
be ident ifiable only by [CONTACT_33160], unique number. This number is used to identify the 
sample and corresponding data at the [COMPANY_008] genet ics laborat ories, or at the 
designated organisation. No personal details ident ifying the individual will be available to 
any person ([COMPANY_008] emplo yee or desi gnated organi sations working with the DNA).
The link between the patient enrolment/rando misatio n code and the second number will 
be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at [COMPANY_008] 
or desi gnated organisat ions. The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples 
for analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul tswith clinical data, allow regulatory  
audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent.
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the study , incl uding this 
genet ics research component, are outlined in Appendix A.
Informed Consent
The genetic component of this study  is opti onal, and the patient may  parti cipat e in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in this genet ic co mponent. To 
participate in the genet ic component of the study the pat ient must si gn and date both the 
consent form for the main study  and the addendum for the Geno mics Init iative com ponent 
of the study . Copi [INVESTIGATOR_415410]. The PI(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent 
is given freely and that the patient understands that they  may freely wit hdrawal fro m the

criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL  and HL  events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including central and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL  
criteria coul d be m et by  [CONTACT_96724] a central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL  from

The invest igator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevat ions 
in liver bio chemistry ) for possible PHL  events.
The invest igator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL  criteria to agree whether HL  criteria are m et. HL  
criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver biochemistry

isolation or in combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3 × ULN
AST ≥ 3 × ULN
TBL ≥ 2 × ULN
Local Laboratories Being Used:
The invest igator will wit hout delay  review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative 
Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section E 2for definit ion) by

symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Completes fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed with the Study  Physician.
Com plete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information beco mes available. 
#A ‘significant ’ change in the patient ’s condi tion refers to a clinically  relevant change in 
any of the individual liver biochemistry  param eters (AL T, AST or TBL) in iso lation or in

E 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL  criteria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL  criteria other than DILI caused by  [CONTACT_415566], to ensure timely  analysis and reporti ng to health authorities within 
15calendar days from  date PHL  criteria was m et. The [COMPANY_008] Glo bal Clinical Lead or 
equivalent a nd Global Safet y Physician will also be involved in this review together with 
other subject matter experts as appropriate. 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Wher e ther e is an agr eedalternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevat ions, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record t he alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 [COMPANY_008]
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_415296] -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 129of 185If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the [COMPANY_008] standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the AL T or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the study  treatm ent:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standa rd 
processes. 
 The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
 As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay ,of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of PHL, (report term now 
‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to study  treatm ent and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SA E reporting, according to the outcome of the review and 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.

E 7 Actions Required for Repeat Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33099]’s Law
This sect ion is applicable when a patient meets PHL  criteria on study  treatm ent and has 
already met PHL  criteria at a previous on study  treatm ent visi t.
The requi rement to conduct fo llow-up, revi ew and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence. 
The invest igator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL  criteria being 
met and answer the fo llowing quest ion:
Was the al ternat ive cause for the previous occurrence of PHL  criteria being met found 
to be the di sease under study  eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe 
infect ion or liver disease or did the parti cipant m eet PHL cri teria prior to starting study  
intervent ion and at their first on- study  interventi on visi t as described in section E 6of
this Appendix?
If No: follow the process described in Sect ion E4.2for reporting PHL  as an SAE
If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant c hange in the pat ient’s condi tion#compared 
with when PHL  criteria were previously  met
If there is no significant change no action is required
If there is a significant change#follow the process described in Section E4.2for reporting 
PHL as an SAE
# A ‘significant ’ change in the pat ient’s condi tion refers to a clinically relevant change in any  
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (AL T, AST or TBL) in isolation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the investigator, this 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.

assessments and procedures may  not be conducted due to internat ional or local pol icies or 
guidelines, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310375]’s safet y. If in doubt, pl ease contact [CONTACT_415574].
H 1 Reconsent of Study Patients During Study Interruptions
During study  interrupt ions, it may not be possible for the patients to complete study  visits and 
assessments on site and alternat ive means for carrying out the visits and assessments may be 
necessary , eg, rem ote visi ts. Reconsent shoul d be obtained for the alternat ive means of 
carrying out visits and assessments and should be obtained prior to performing the procedures 
described in Sections H 2to H 6. Local and regional regulat ions and/or guidelines regarding 
reconsent of study  patients shoul d be checked and fo llowed. Reconsent may  be verbal  if
allowed by  [CONTACT_96728] (note, i n the case of verbal consent/reconsent the ICF

Disease response assessment will be evaluated using the Lugano 2014 Classificat ion for NHL  
(Cheson et al 2014 ).
Response assessments will be done by [CONTACT_415579], as determined by [CONTACT_415580] [ADDRESS_523832] 
response evaluat ions in accordance with the BICR charter (provided separately from this 
protocol ). Primary  and secondary efficacy  endpoints will  be based on BICR review . Blinded 
independent central review assessment will not be reported back to Sites. Investigator's 
assessment overall disease response will also be collected in eCRF .
Tumour assessment will be made for target lesio ns (ie, measurable disease), non- target lesio ns 
(ie, non -measurable disease), organ enlargement (eg, spleen, liver), and new l esions on CT 
and co mbined with visual assessment of PET -CT for response assessment ( Cheson et al 2014, 
TableI20).
Visual Interpretation of PET -CT Scans
Variation in FDG uptake in a nodal or extranodal sites indicat ive for lympho ma will be 
visually assessed using the Deauville 5 -point scale.
Target lesio ns
Up to a m aximum  of 6dominant, measurable lymph nodal or extranodal lesio ns should be 
assessed as target lesio ns and documented at baseline and throughout the study.
A lesio n will  be considered measurable if:
For nodal lesio ns: LDi > 1.5cm
For extranodal lesio n: LDi > 1cm
Lesio ns visible on PET but not on CT/MRI to be assigned as non -target lesio ns.
Target nodal or extranodal lesio ns nodes should be selected according to all o f the following:
They  should be clearly  measurable in at least 2perpendicular dimensio ns
If possible, they  should be fro m disparate regions of the body
They  should include mediast inal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites 
are invo lved
The perpendicular long and short axis diameters will be measur ed and recorded in the 
transverse plane at baseline and fo llow-up.
Clinical Study Protocol -6.[ADDRESS_523833] of the perpendicular 
diameters will be calculated with the percentage change fro m baseline for assessment of 
response and nadir for assessment of progression.
Non-target lesions:
All other lesio ns (including nodal, extranodal, and assessable disease) not selected as target 
lesions, as well as truly non -measurable sites of disease should be fo llowed as nonmeasurable 
disease ( eg, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial 
effusio ns, ascites) and should be factored into the overall response assessment. Non -target 
lesions will be documented at baseline and throughout the study . Measurement o f these 
lesions is not requi red to be docum ented on the eCRFs. 
Spleen involvement
Spleen will be considered to be normal if size o f its vert ical length (cranial -caudal  
measurement) is ≤ [ADDRESS_523834] diam eter of the liver will be assessed at 
screening and all subsequent response evaluations.
Bone Marrow involvement
Bone m arrow involvement by  [CONTACT_348902] a docum ented by  [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or bi opsy  will be 
reported on the eCRF as present or absent.

aA score of [ADDRESS_523838] treatment, especially if at the time of 
an interim scan. However, in studies involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be 
preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid under treatment). Measured dominant 
lesions: Up to [ADDRESS_523839] dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly 
measurable in 2 diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should 
include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions inclu de those in solid 
organs (eg, liver spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on 
palpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly 
assessable disease should be considered n ot measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and 
extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for 
measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is an y site of 
suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural 
effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be 
confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_9661]. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, bone 
marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic response, but 
should be no higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (eg, with marrow activatio n as a result of 
chemotherapy of myeloid growth factors).

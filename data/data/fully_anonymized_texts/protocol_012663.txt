STUDY PROTOCOL  
 
CONSENT:  
Consent is obtained by [CONTACT_894285] a B achelor's degree or higher, who  passed all 
necessary  CITI training, and are IRB-approved to obtain consent. A link to the consent form  is 
sent to the  participant prior to the consent session. Consent forms are either signed in -person on 
paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_894280] t. Potential participants are emailed the link to the electronic 
consent form prior to the virtual consent session, which they can access with any device that can 
connect to the internet. The Redcap consenting record is upda ted to contain the most recent IRB -
approved and  stamped Consent and HIPAA forms. All potential  participants are asked if they 
give additional, optional consent to have their participation in the  study filmed for use in front of 
a professional audience. If participants give consent to be filmed, they are provided with an 
additional consent form addendum. An informed Consent Form is sent via an alert  which is 
logged, time -stamped & encrypted when the "protect mode" is turned on. The risks related to a  
loss of confidentiality when using electronic devices to transmit, store, and/or access the Consent 
Form  and HIPAA forms are outlined in the Consent Form and discussed during the consent 
process.  Additionally, the possibility that data could be accessed by [CONTACT_2312], should the participant 
lose their electronic device, lend the device to other people, or if the device is subject to a search 
warrant or  subpoena, is described to the participant during the consenting session. All 
participants who sign via REDCAp, are offered  the option to  receive the consent and HIPAA 
forms as hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_894281].

If eligible based on the initial phone screen, participants are asked to participate in a follow -up 
screening  session, either by [CONTACT_894286] ( which are determined by [CONTACT_894287], which is administered by a licensed clinician or an  unlicensed clinician under 
licensed supervision . 
 
PHASE [ADDRESS_1252842] consented for this screening session. If consented, the  potential 
participant undergoes  a screening conducted by [CONTACT_894288] a licensed  
clinician or an unlicensed clinician under licensed supervision . 
The potential participant then meets  virtually with a licensed clinician or an unlicensed clinician 
under licensed  supervision who conducts a  clinical interview and a standardized  assessment 
(MINI) to screen for psychosis, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Participants  that 
meet  criteria for any of those disorders are not enrolled in the study, but the clinician is to 
proceed  by: (1)  making an immediate appropriate referral, or (2) arranging for an immediate 
psychiatric evaluation . 
Information collected during the screening procedure was used to confirm eligibility based on 
the IRB  approved inclusion and exclusion criteria. The screening and the screening results were 
reviewed and  approved by [CONTACT_978]. 
 
Baseline Assessment  (20-29 weeks gestation) : 
A trained research  worker  will administer the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM -A) and Hamilton 
Depression Scale (HAM -D) to the participant.  
 
Prenatal Session  1 (28-32 weeks  gestation ) 
At this time point, i f the individual agrees  to participate  in this session  and gives  consent, the 
individual  is randomly assigned to one of two  groups: Intervention vs. Enhanced Treatment As 
Usual (ETAU). When the participants are 28 -32 weeks  pregnant, they participate in an i n-person 
session (pre -COVID) or  in a virtual session  (during COVID ), either by [CONTACT_99444], and 
are asked to  complete mood assessments, a cognitive assessment s and answer questionnaires 
about feelings, life events, and  sleep. Participants are asked a questionnaire about the effect of 
COVID -19 on their lives. I n total, these  questionnaires take about 90 minutes. All questionnaire 
results are entered in Redcap, an online secure  database. All information entered in R EDCap  is 
de-identified using a screen ID. At home, we ask participants to wear a n activity monitor for 7 
full 24 -hour days. We ask participants to complete a  sleep diary noting sleep times and durations 
for the seven consecutive days they are wearing the  activity monitor . 
 
Prenatal Session  2 (34-39 weeks)  
At [ADDRESS_1252843]  another session (in -person if pre -COVID or virtual if 
during COVID) , and complete mood assessments, a cognitive assessment, and answer more 
questions about feelings and sleep. This session takes  about  75 minutes. They are asked to wear  
the activity monitor again for 7 days and complete a sleep diary (5 -10 minutes to complete).  
 
All participants are provided with psychoeducation (and an information sheet) that highlight s the 
warning signs of depression and the risks of depression and contact [CONTACT_894289]. All participants 
(regardless of group assignment) are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_894290] a referral for treatment.  
 
Newborn Session ([ADDRESS_1252844] -delivery)  
Participants  are invited to have their newborn participate in an EEG sleep study that occur s 
between 18 -36 hours after birth in the newborn nursery. We will examine variation in EEG 
left/right power asymmetry in relation to potential group differences in the effectiveness of the 
intervention in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_894283] a social "buffer" and modulate infant reactivity. The 
newborn EEG sleep protocol takes  place in the newborn nursery while the baby [CONTACT_894291][INVESTIGATOR_007]. This 
is a non -clinical EEG recording. A cap with EEG sensors is placed on the newborn’s head by a 
trained  member of the research team. The research team then wait s for the baby [CONTACT_894292] a state 
of quiet sleep. This allow s the research team time to measure brain activity while the baby 
[CONTACT_894293] . The participant is reassured by [CONTACT_894294]  a 
slight red mark for a brief time  after they are removed, this procedure is completely painless and 
does not harm the newborn.  
 
The EEG session takes  approximately [ADDRESS_1252845] of the study.  Participants did not 
complete  this session during the COVID pandemic . 
 
6-Week Postpartum Session  
At 6 weeks postpartum, participants are asked to participate in another session  (in-person if pre -
COVID or virtual if during COVID) , to complete mood assessments. This session is about an 
hour.  During this session, participants are videotaped as they engage in a standard routine of 
infant care . This takes  about [ADDRESS_1252846] eted in -person (not virtually) , participants are invited to complete the 
infant EEG. We will examine variation in EEG left/right power asymmetry in relation to 
potential group differences in the effectiveness of the intervention in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_894283] 
a social "buffer" and modulate infant reactivity. The 6-week  postpartum  EEG sleep protocol 
takes  place while the baby [CONTACT_894291][INVESTIGATOR_007]. This is a non -clinical EEG recording. A cap with EEG 
sensors is placed on the newborn’s head by a trained  member of the research team. The research 
team then wait s for the baby [CONTACT_894292] a state of quiet sleep. This  allow s the research team time to 
measure brain activity while the baby [CONTACT_894293] . The participant is reassured by [CONTACT_894295] a red mark briefly after they are removed, this 
procedure is completely painless and does not harm the newborn.  
 
The EEG session takes  approximately [ADDRESS_1252847] information about infant  behavior during the session. In total, including 
setup of materials and video -recording, the 6-week EEG session is approximately 1.5 hours  in 
duration . 
 
The participant is allowed extra time to pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049], feed, comfort, or change the infant  to 
accommodate fussiness or discomfort at any time during the EEG. If the participant is 
uncomfortable with the EEG, they are free to stop  the session.  
 
Participants wear  an activity  monitor again for 7 full days. While wearing the monitors, 
participants complete  a sleep diary noting sleep times and durations, which takes  about 5 -10 
minutes.  Participants in the treatment group are asked to complete a diary entry that ask s them 
the frequency and duration of their utilization of the skills learned from PREPP (i.e., 
carrying/holding baby, accentuation of  day/night cues, focal feeding, use of swaddling, 
mindfulness techniques). These questions  take about 10 minutes to complete. Infant sleep is 
assessed using a Smart Sleep Sensor worn by [CONTACT_58076]. The Sensor detects  day and night sleep 
activity by [CONTACT_894296]. Infants wear  
the Sensor for four days (24 - hour periods ). 
12-Week Phone S ession  
At 12 weeks postpartum, participants complete mood assessments over the phone. This takes  
about an  hour to complete.  
16-Week Postpartum Session  
At 16  weeks postpartum, participants are asked to participate in a final session  (in-person if pre -
COVID or virtual if during COVID) to complete mood assessments and other questions related 
to feelings, life events, and  sleep. Participants are asked again to complete a questionnaire about 
the effect of COVID -19 on their lives  (if during COVID pandemic) . 
All together, these questionnaires take an hour to complete. Participants  are asked to sit on the 
floor and  play with their baby [CONTACT_2329] a set of toys they usually use at home. They are asked to 
engage in free play for  10 minutes, and their play interaction is videorecorded and later coded 
using the Emotional Availability  (EA) Scales.  Mothers and infants are also asked to participate 
in a modified 'double' Still Face Protocol (SFP), an A -B-A-B-A design with alternating free -play 
(A) and still -face (B) periods. The entire SFP session is videotaped for later behavioral coding . 
The session begins  with five minutes of face -to-face free play, followed by a two -minute still -
face epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Two ad ditional free -play periods and a second still -face epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], each lasting two 
minutes, follow s. A study coordinator signal s transitions by [CONTACT_3041] "Switch" . If the infant crie s 
for more than [ADDRESS_1252848], signs of avoidance (infant head turn and back arch), and duration of infant distress/crying 
and neutral/positive vocalizations will be coded. Mothers will be coded for duration of 
vocalizations to the infant, touching t he infant, and positive/negative affect.  
 
During this session, participants are also  videotaped as they engage in a standard routine of 
infant care. This takes  about [ADDRESS_1252849] s day and night sleep activity by [CONTACT_894297]. Infants wear  the Sensor for four days (24 - hour 
periods).

Treatment  Protocols : 
Experimental Arm: PREPP Intervention  
The intervention is carried out at [ADDRESS_1252851] medical visits (3rd trimester ultrasounds and 6 -Week Well Baby [CONTACT_765]),  which 
enable us  to test the feasibility of incorporating these sessions into routine medical care. A 
licensed  trained clinician or an unlicensed trained clinician under  licensed  supervision provide  
the intervention. The sessions of this preventive psychotherapy are comprised of three 
components: (a) mindfulness  and self -reflection skills, (b) parenting skills and (c)psycho -
education.  The intervention protocol encompasse s the following 5 specific established behavioral 
techniques: (1) feeding  the infant between 10 pm and midnight, even if s/he must be awakened 
(‘a focal feed’); (2) accentuating differences between day and night cues so that there are higher 
levels of stimulation during the former than the  latter; (3) assuming adequate weight gain is 
reached by 3 weeks, lengthening the la tency to feeding time in the middle of the night by 
[CONTACT_894302]; the goal is to 
lengthen the nighttime feeding intervals by [CONTACT_894303]; (4) carrying infants for a minimum of 3 hours a day, throughout the day, 
independent of responding to crying, carrying during feeding, and whether the baby [CONTACT_894304]; 
and (5) learning to swaddle the baby [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a possible soothing intervention. Min dfuln ess-based tools 
are provided with the aim to (1) aid them to return to sleep after waking at night, (2) help them to 
cope better when their babies are distressed or unsoothable. These mindfulness exercises are 
provided as audio files via an App.  
 
Active Comparator: Enhanced Treatment As Usual (ETAU):  
ETAU comprise s Postpartum Depression  psychoeducation, mood assessments, and referral for 
treatment if needed or requested by [CONTACT_2299]. Three sessions  are delivered by [CONTACT_894305] . Participants 
receive "usual care" along with Postpartum Depression psychoeducation and enhanced support 
for finding perinatal mental healthcare treatment when appropriate by [CONTACT_894306] a study 
clinician specifically assigned to provide ETAU in this study  at three times that are aligned with 
PREPP sessions that span from pregnancy to [ADDRESS_1252852], 
participants meet  with their assigned ETAU clinician and are given information about [COMPANY_003], a 
brief clinical mental health assessment, and a referral for treatment if warranted or requested; the 
second session is a follow -up mental health clinical assessment with the study clinician and a 
referral for treatment if warranted or requested; at the third session, participants meet  again with 
their study clinician an d receive a mental health assessment, review relevant psychoeducation on 
[COMPANY_003] and are referred to treatment when appropriate.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Overall . Based on preliminary data, we anticipate minimal attrition (≤5%) during the first two 
assessment sessions (pre -delivery), and up to 33% attrition postpartum across both groups in the 
worst -case scenario. All participants with data available for a given s tudy phase (pre - or 
postpartum) will be included in the primary analyses. Before conducting hypothesis tests, we 
will screen all variables at all time points for out -of-range values, outliers, and data 
inconsistencies. Means, standard deviations, in terquartile range, minima, and maxima for 
continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables will be reported.  
  
Following CONSORT guidelines, the primary analyses for all aims will follow an intention -to-
treat (ITT) approach, including all randomized participants regardless of treatment adherence or 
dropout. If significant imbalances in baseline covariates (e.g., ma ternal age, BMI, birth order, 
infant sex) are observed despi[INVESTIGATOR_39470], these variables will be included as covariates in 
the models. Additional exploratory models will examine relevant biological factors, such as 
maternal BMI, fetal/infant sex, mate rnal age, infant gestational age at birth, and birthweight 
corrected for birth age, as potential covariates.  
  
Aim 1.  Reduce women’s distress during pregnancy.  We hypothesize that PREPP will be 
associated with: (A) Diminished depressive symptoms using interviewer -rated and self -report 
questionnaires; (B) Improved perception of sleep quality relative to objective changes in sleep 
duration (per self report and act igraphy).  
  
Analysis for Aim 1A : For depressive symptom outcomes (HRSD, PHQ -9, HRSA, PSQI, 
EPDS), we will fit linear mixed -effects models with fixed effects for Treatment (PREPP vs. 
ETAU), Time (2nd and 3rd assessments), and birth order, along with subject -specific random 
intercepts. Fo r EPDS, we will adjust for the screening score and test a Treatment × Screening 
Score interaction as a secondary analysis. Additional moderators will also be tested.  
Analysis for Aim 1B : Two ActiGraph -derived measures, total sleep time (TSTact) and sleep 
efficiency (SEact), will serve as outcomes in separate mixed -effects models with fixed effects for 
time and day (within the ActiGraph epoch) and subject -specific random intercepts, assum ing an 
AR(1) correlation structure. We will assess whether adjustment for weekday/weekend is 
warranted. Subject -specific means of these measures will be used as predictors of their subjective 
counterparts (TSTact, SEact) in additional mixed models testing for treatment group differences 
in the association between objective and subjective sleep measures. Moderation by [CONTACT_894307].  
  
Aim 2.  Determine the maintenance of improved maternal mood and differences in infant 
behavior . We hypothesize that PREPP will be associated with: (A) Lower rates of [COMPANY_003] and 
distress, including poor sleep efficiency, assessed by [CONTACT_86296] -rated and self -report 
questionnaires as well as sleep actigraphy. (B) Less infant fuss/cry behavior and longe r nocturnal 
sleep bouts based on maternal report and actigraphy.  
  
Analysis for Aim 2A:   Separate linear mixed -effects models will be used for each maternal 
mood outcome (PHQ -9, HRSD, EPDS, HRSA, PSQI) and ActiGraph -derived sleep measures. 
Models will include Treatment, Time (6, 12, and 16 weeks postpartum), and their interaction, 
with basel ine (pregnancy) values as covariates. Subject -specific random intercepts will be 
included. The primary parameter of interest is the Treatment × Time interaction; if non -
significant, the main effect of Treatment will be tested. [COMPANY_003] diagn osis will be modeled using 
mixed -effects logistic regression with analogous fixed effects.  
For infant outcomes (6 and 16 weeks), linear mixed -effects models will assess Treatment effects 
without Time × Treatment interaction. Sleep data will be processed as in Aim 1B. Covariates 
include time -varying factors such as weaning, solid food introductio n, maternal return to work, 
and social support. Moderators (infant sex, trauma history, attachment) will also be assessed.  
Analysis for Aim 2B:   Infant sleep and cry behavior  at 6 and 16 weeks will be compared using 
mixed -effects models with Treatment, Time, and their interaction as fixed effects. Covariates and 
secondary analyses will be same as those in Aim 2A.  
  
Aim 3.  Identify some of the pathways by [CONTACT_894308] . We 
hypothesize that PREPP -associated: (A) Lower depression scores postpartum will be mediated 
by [CONTACT_368467]/or temporally earlier maternal reports of less infant fuss/cry behavior and 
higher parenting competence; (B) Less infant fuss/cry behavior wil l be mediated by [CONTACT_894309]/or temporally earlier negative infant attributions and higher concurrent observed 
maternal sensitivity; (C) More positive perceptions and objecti ve assessments of maternal 
postpartum sleep efficiency will be mediated by [CONTACT_894310][INVESTIGATOR_894284].  
  
Analysis for Aim 3 : Structural equation models will be used to test multiple -mediation. The 
mediation and Lavaan R packages will be used for this modeling as it can accommodate both 
continuous and ordered categorical (including dichotomous) variables. Indirect effects (i.e.  
combined mediational pathways) will be tested using the bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_18499] [ADDRESS_1252853] of PREPP on maternal depressive 
symptoms at week 16 is mediated by [CONTACT_894311]/cry beha vior and higher parenting competence 
assessed at 6 and 16 weeks after delivery. A model without inclusion of week 16 mediators will 
also be considered (due to the contemporaneousness of week 16 with the outcome). For Aim 3B, 
the primary outcome is infant f uss/cry behavior at week 16 and mediators are the maternal 
reports of negative infant attribution assessed at 6 and 16 weeks after delivery and maternal 
sensitivity at week 16 after delivery. Because of the concurrently observed mediators and 
outcomes, alt ernative mediational pathways will be evaluated and compared. For Aim 3C, a 
mediation model with EEG power at week 6 and avg. infant sleep (actigraphy) quality will be 
assessed as mediators of the treatment effect on maternal sleep at week 16, controlling for EEG 
power at birth as a covariate.  
  
Power analysis  We adjusted for multiple comparisons (five primary outcomes across Aims 1 and 
2) using Bonferroni correction, resulting in a significance threshold of 0.01. For Aim 1, with N = 
214 and an assumed 5% attrition, our mixed -effects model analysis is powered t o detect a 
minimum effect size of d = 0.48 (assuming within -subject correlation r = 0.2). Prior research has 
shown larger effects (e.g., d = 0.85 for EPDS in mindfulness -based therapy), indicating our 
design has ample power. For Aim 2, assumi ng 33% attrition and five primary outcomes, power 
calculations show that N = [ADDRESS_1252854] interactions as small as d = 0.087 
with 80% power at a Bonferroni -adjusted α = 0.01. Our preliminary data support this 
assumption. For Aim 3,  based on tabulated recommendations [ADDRESS_1252855] 
mediation effects, with N=142 completers (assuming 33% attrition for assessments), we have 
more than 80% power to detect a significant mediation effect with moderate effect sizes (d=0. 54, 
r=0.26) of both paths (i.e. the paths from treatment to the mediator(s) and the mediator(s) to 
outcomes). Since the full sample (N = 214) will be used in mediation models, the actual power 
will exceed this estimate.

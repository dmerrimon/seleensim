1.0 Objectives  
 
Primary Objectives:  
 1) To determine whether oral ribavirin given for therapy of Respi[INVESTIGATOR_14250] 
(RSV) upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (URI) can prevent its progression to Lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_907701] (LRI)- pneumonia, when compared to aerosolized ribavirin – modified regimen in 
HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_907702].    
Secondary Objectives:  
 1) To determine the safety of oral ribavirin therapy when compared to  aerosolized ribavirin.  
 2) To calculate the cost effectiveness of using oral ribavi rin when compared to aerosolized 
ribavirin.  3) To compare RSV viral loads in nasal washes and/or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_907703] a observational arm where low risk patient s for progression are not receiving either regimen of ribavirin.  
 2.[ADDRESS_1274065] 2 decades, it has become apparent that community respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398] (e.g. RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, pi[INVESTIGATOR_295347]) can cause serious infections in patients with cancer, particularly in patients with acute leukemia and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. They are also associated with bacterial or fungal co -infections leadin g to the development of respi[INVESTIGATOR_907704] -infections. 
Though studies have shown that many RSV infections may resolve uneventfully without therapy, some patients do progress to LRI , increasing the morbidity and the mortality of such patients. In 
fact, a recent study concluded that cancer patients with RSV LRI, and with severe immunodeficiency and pre -engraftment are at high risk for RSV -attributed mortality. The use of 
ribavirin based regimens has been shown to halt this progression and reduce the morbidity and mortality in  mainly case series from single institutions with no data from randomized or 
nonrandomised trials. Furthermore, in a recent systematic review on the use of ribavirin either orally, intravenously or in its aerosolized form, we determined tha t such therapy may halt 
progression of RSV from the upper to the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_907705] ( Figure, Shah J and Chemaly RF, Blood, March 2011).

Abbreviations: AR= Aerosolized ribavirin; IR= Intravenous ribavirin; OR= Oral ribavirin  
 
Aerosolized ribavirin is the recommended therapy for RSV LRI  and became the standard of care 
in many cancer centers . It has been used for treat ment of LRI in leukemic and HSCT patients, 
usually in combination with IVIG. Because of the substantial morbidity and risk of fatality from 
LRI, ribavirin is also given pre -emptively to high -risk cancer patients with RSV URI to prevent 
progression to LRI. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_907706], the drug is not routinely recommended due to inconvenience of administration, cost, and questionable efficacy because of lack of randomised 
controlled trials. The cost of a 10 day course of aerosolized ribavirin alone could be between 
$50,000 and $80,000, based on estimates from our financial department. While RSV infection involving only the URT may resolve uneventfully in some immunosuppressed patients, the infection can progress to the LRT with a substantial increase in mortality rate in many other patients.  Hence, many of these patients who present with RSV URI are treated with aerosolized ribavirin to prevent progression. In the above mentioned system atic review, we concluded that 
“prompt diagnosis of RSV infection should be coupled with an aggressive approach to management in HSCT patient s who have at least one identifiable risk factor for progression to 
LRI, such as absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) less than 300/μL or GVHD, with early initiation 
of ribavirin therapy in either aerosolized or oral form before development of RSV LRI. The oral form of this drug should be explored further, as it is less expensive and probably has fewer and milder side eff ects than the aerosolized formulation”. It is common practice in many institutions 
(in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe) to initiate oral ribavirin therapy for RSV infections in HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_907707].     We also validated a scoring system on a cohort of [ADDRESS_1274066] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_907708]. Briefly, a  
weighted index accounting for the number and intensity of immunodeficiency markers was 

  Protocol # 2011- 0813  
  04-07-2014  
 
developed and validated in this cohort. Adjusted relative risks calculated from Cox proportional 
hazards regression modeling were assigned as weights to these immunodeficiency markers ; 
absolute neutrophil count ( ANC) , ALC; myeloablative chemotherapy; corticosteroids in past 30 
days; GvHD; HSCT within 30 days or pre -engraftment or both;  and age were utilized to generate 
an immunodeficiency score  (ISS)  (range: 0 –12) for each patient. ISS scores were discretized to 
classify patients into low -risk (0 -2), moderate -risk (3 -6), and high- risk (7 -12) groups. Each 
increased level of the ISS was accompanied by [CONTACT_907721] 
(LRI) and mortality attributable to immunodeficiency. There were signi ficant differences in the 
progression to LRI and mortality ( p<0.0001) based on the scoring classification groups. RSV -
targeted antiviral therapy given at the URI stage was a significant predictor of LRI and mortality. The ISS predicted the risk of these outcomes more proficiently, when the system was stratified by [CONTACT_3148] (Table).   This n ew ISS provides an easy, practical, and clinically applicable method 
of predicting the risk of progression to RSV LRI and death in allo- HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_907709]  (Abstract in the Proceedings of the 51th ICAAC meeting in 
Chicago, IL, 9/2011) . Based on these results, only patients with ISS of at least 3 (moderate to 
high risk) will be offered therapy for RSV URI.

 The recommended method for ribavirin administration at our institution is a daily dose of 6g delivered at a concentration of 20 milligrams/milliliter for 18 hours daily (standard regimen) aerosolization by a small- particle aerosol generator unit (SPAG -2) via a face mask inside a 
scavenging tent for 5 to 10 days. A modified regimen with dose of 60 milligrams/milliliter (or 2 grams) given over [ADDRESS_1274067] regimen (probability of 0.889; unpublished data; Oral presentation at the 49th Interscience 
  Protocol # 2011- 0813  
  04-07-2014  
 
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 2009).  Although this dosage schedule 
has been used, either one can be inconvenient for patients, and makes routine patient care more 
difficult.   Alternatively, many patients have been treated with oral ribavirin with particularly encouraging 
results ( Figure above ). This drug has been approved by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA) in combination with interferon alfa -2b for the treatment of Hepatitis C and it is 
commercially available in generic form. Although oral ribavirin  was adopted as part of the 
armamentarium for therapy of RSV infection in immunocompromised patients in many centers  
in the US and Europe, further trials are necessary to demonstrate its efficacy and safety. A recent 
study done in Basel, Switzerland report ed a total of [ADDRESS_1274068] patients treated with oral ribavirin, 
of these 11 patients had URI, while 8 had LRI. A decrease in RSV viral loads of 2 log
10 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL within 7 days after treatment initiation was seen in 11 patients and none progressed to LRI or died. Another 6 patients reported a mean decrease in RSV load of 2 log
10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL 
within 14 days of diagnosis, LRI occurred in 2 patients and 1 died. The authors also found that 
the rate of disease progression and mortality rate to be comparable to studies evaluating aerosolized ribavirin (Khanna et al, CID 2008:46 407). They further concluded that prospective, 
multicenter studies are needed to identif y effective antiviral treatment for RSV infection among 
immunocompromised patient groups, where systemic ribavirin could be an option.   A systematic evaluation of oral ribavirin as an alternative therapeutic regimen for RSV infection needs to be explored. A double blind randomized comparative trial is not feasible due to the 
relatively small number of HSCT patients with this infection every year on the national level. We 
would like to conduct this phase II randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral 
ribavirin for prevention of RSV LRI when compared to aerosolized regimen ("modified 
regimen"). If oral use of ribavirin is as effective as the aerosolized regimen, this would be immensely beneficial to the patients as it would make the administration of ribavirin easier and 
more convenient and may prevent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51531] a good proportion of patients with 
tremendous impact on cost savings. Furthermore, it may increase its use and also encourage its 
early use in the therapy of RSV URI, which may have a favorable impact on overall morbidity 
and mortality in our immunocompromised patients.  3.0 Background Drug Information and Dosage  
 
Ribavirin in its oral or aerosolized form is commercially available. Drug information is provided  
in the attached package insert (Appendix D ).  
 Oral ribavirin has been used at varying doses for treatment of RSV based on bioavailability and a  
large volume of distribution.  A loading dose of 10 mg/kg orally has been used as bioavailability can range from 30- 74% due to first pass metabolism (Khanna N, et al. Clin Infect Dis . 
2008;46(3):402- 412).  Due to the short duration of therapy, 5 to 10 days, this will help to increase 
ribavirin  concentration more quickly. After the loading dose, a total daily dose of 20 mg/kg/day 
divided into three doses given with food (max dose of 1800 mg per day). This dosing strategy 
falls within a previous efficacy and toxicity trial where doses between 15- 45 mg/kg/day were 
employed (Chakrabarti S, et al. Bone  Marrow Transplant . 2001;28(8):759- 763). Efficacy and 
decreased  toxicity were found in the  lower dose cohorts 15- 30 mg/kg/day.

 5.0 Treatment Plan  
 This is an open label randomised trial. All eligible patients will be randomized to receive ribavirin therapy either at the modified schedule of 60 mg/ml of the drug for a 3- hour period 3 
times/day for at least 5 days by [CONTACT_907725] a SPAG -2 generat or via a face mask OR  
patients will receive a one time loading dose of 10 mg/kg oral dose then 20 mg/kg orally (rounded to the nearest 200 mg dose) divided into three doses per day at a maximum of total dose of 1800 mg/day (therapeutic arms ). The duration of either regimen is recommended to be 
up to [ADDRESS_1274074] of care. Patients may receive albuterol 
(2.5 mg per 3ml for adults) nebulization, if Xopenex is not tolerated. Patients will not be given IVIG or palivizumab for treatment of the RSV URI. Patients who develop evidence of LRI at 
any time will be considered reaching the primary endpoint and will be managed at the discretion 
of the treating physician as per standard of care (for example, patients can be treated by [CONTACT_907726]).  
 Patients with mild immundeficiency who are at low risk (scoring of 0 -2 on ISS) for progression 
and when treatment is not indicated for RSV URI as per standard  of care (observational arm ) will 
be followed prospectively  once a week  up to 4 weeks from the diagnosis of RSV.

  Protocol # 2011- 0813  
  04-07-2014  
 
7.3 Patients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of URI and LRI (Please see Appendix 
G and H  for Clinical Assessment Tool). Patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907711] [ADDRESS_1274083] radiographic study and/or oxygen saturation level. All 
patients on the  therapeutic arms will have a final visit 14 days +  1 days after end of therapy.  
 
7.4 Follow -up after end of therapy or discontinuation of therapy: Patients will be seen 14 
days + 1 days after discontinuation of therapy for the final determination of response, unless 
there is progression to pneumonia. In the latter scenario or if study drug is discontinued for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), patients will be followed for up to [ADDRESS_1274084] dose of the study drug.  
 
7.5 Physical Exams for the therapeutic arm  will be done at day 3 ±1 day, day 7 (± 1 days), 
day 14 ( + 1 days), and then 14 days ( + 1 days) after end of therapy. Concomitant  medications 
that are used to treat LRI will be rec orded day (3 ±1 day), day 7 (± 1  days), and then at 14 days 
(+ 1 days) after end of therapy. Physical exams for observational arm will b e done once a week 
for [ADDRESS_1274085] pulmonary function tests scheduled bewteen 6 -10 
weeks  after completing therapy for RSV.   
 8.0 Criteria for Response  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_907712] 14 +  1 days after end of therapy. Patients will be considered as a success if there are 
no signs (clinical and/or radiologic) or symptoms of  progr ession to pneumonia at the end of 
study, that is 14 +  1 days after discontinuation of therapy or at week 4 of follow -up for patients 
on the observational arm . At the end of each winter season  and without knowledge of the 
determination of response of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_907713] , an independent internal panel ([ADDRESS_1274086] and 1 in Infectious Diseases  to be determined ) will review each case and determine failure 
(pneumonia) or success (no evidence of pneumonia) rate on each arm of the study. The panel 
will have the final determination of response.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1274087] failed therapy if they develop evidence of pulmonary 
infection secondary to RSV (documented by [CONTACT_907728]/or Oxygen saturation level less than 90 mm Hg on room air). Therapy could be stopped or could be changed to either the standard or the modified regimen of aerosolized ribavirin if the patient is on the oral schedule and changed to the standard or continued on t he modified regimen of aerosolized ribavirin if the 
patient is on the aerosolized regimen; all at the discretion of the primary care service. IVIG 500mg/kg every other day for 4 doses or Synagis (palivizumab) 15mg/kg as a single dose can be used in combina tion with aerosolized ribavirin.  
 
  Protocol # 2011- 0813  
  04-07-2014  
 
9.2 Adverse events to ribavirin requiring discontinuation of therapy are: deterioration of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], abnormal liver function tests (>5 x the upper normal limits), frequent 
bronchospasms not responding to bronchodilators, hypotension and cardiac arrest.  
 9.3 Anemia may occur due to ribavirin and therapy would be discontinued if there is 
evidence of severe hemolysis and/or the patient develops severe anemia as per the NCI 
classification i.e. Hemoglobin below 8 g/ dl for more than 48 hours and does not respond to blood 
and/or blood products transfusion.  
  10.[ADDRESS_1274088] of 
treating patients with ribavirin using the following formula : 
 Total cost of treating the patients with ribavirin (aerosolized or oral) = cost of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_907714]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907715] × total number of days the patient is kept in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] + cost of the 
drug (aerosolized and oral ribavirin) and its administration (for aerosolized ribavirin).  This will be compared to the total cost of administering oral ribavirin on an outpatient basis by [CONTACT_907729]. In either arm of the study, if a patient progresses to pneumonia, the total cost of treating the patient with aerosolized ribavirin (if 
applicable) will be calculated using the above formula and added to the total cost.   11.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
This is a randomized phase II non- inferiority screening trial following the principles described 
by [CONTACT_660456]. (2005). Our primary outcome for this trial is progression to lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_19629] (i.e., pneumonia) by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_1274089] not developed pneumonia by [CONTACT_4475] 14 after completion of therapy will be considered treatment successes.  
 Randomization  Patients will be randomized to either aerosolized ribavirin (standard therapy) or oral ribavirin (experimental therapy) using the CORe patient registration system. Block  randomization will be 
utilized and stratified by [CONTACT_907730] (moderate versus high).  
 Sample Size  
 We expect that 20% of patients randomized to aerosolized ribavirin will be considered treatment failures, and we expect that 15% of patients randomized to oral ribavirin will be considered treatment failures. With a non -inferiority margin of 10%, a sample size of 38 patients per 
  Protocol # 2011- 0813  
  04-07-2014  
 
treatment arm will yield 80% power to reject the following null hypothesis with a 1 -sided 
significance level of 0.20:  
 
H0: πoral - πaerosol  > 0.10 
 
H1: π oral - πaerosol  < 0.[ADDRESS_1274090] to enroll these patients over 2 winter seasons. 
 This sample size calculation includes an interim analysis for futility using the  methods of Lan 
and DeMets (1983) with an O’Brien- Fleming (1979) stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106]. The futility analysis 
will be conducted once [ADDRESS_1274091] 5.2 (Copyright © 2008, Cytel Inc., Cambridge, MA).  
 
For the observational arm , up to [ADDRESS_1274092] 95% binomial 
confidence intervals for each treatment arm.  
 We will tabulate adverse events for each treatment arm by [CONTACT_907731].  
 
We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the costs associated with each treatment arm. Costs for each patient will be calculated as described in section 10.0 above.  
 
We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the RSV viral loads and neutralizing antibodies 
for each treatment arm and the observational arm . 
 12.0 Reporting Requirements  & Drug Accountability  
 A case report form wil l be required for each patient entered on study (please see appendix G  and 
H).  An interim safety analysis of the data focusing on SAEs  will be done after each winter 
season.  
  Protocol # 2011- 0813  
  04-07-2014  
 
 
We will maintain the study drug records of aerosolized ribavirin including docum entation 
of the amount received and duration as per respi[INVESTIGATOR_907716]. For oral 
ribavirin, subjects should bring their medication bottles back at each visit even if they are empty so site personnel can assess study drug compliance.

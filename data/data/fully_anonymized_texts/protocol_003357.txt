research protocol, or a summary of the preclinical/animal data and any relevant clinical data.    
  
Physician Initiated protocol:  If you have not been provided a protocol from an outside source, you must develop one. 
The following is the "Henry Ford Health System “IRB Protocol Format".  
  
1. PURPOSE:  State in one or two sentences the purpose or objective of this project.  The goal of this study is to evaluate the 
effectiveness of different formulations of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_876446] (TAP) on post-
operative pain management after open abdominal hysterectomy.  
  
2. SPECIFIC AIMS:  Number your aims so that the aims can be referred to in the Project Design and Data Analysis sections 
of this outline. 1) To determine if a TAP block with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_876447]-operative analgesia 
after open abdominal hysterectomy.  2) To determine if the mixing of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_876448] a TAP block.  
  
3. RATIONALE FOR THE PROJECT:  
a. State the rationale for the project and support it with background information about the project. Critically evaluate 
existing knowledge, and specifically identify the gaps in knowledge the project will fill.  Liposomal  
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] a novel formulation of the local anesthetic bupi[INVESTIGATOR_876449] [ADDRESS_1224337]-operative analgesia after robotic prostatectomy, laparoscopic colorectal surgery, 
and abdominal hernia repair; however, those studies did not compare the effectiveness of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_876450].  Our experience at 
Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_876451]. This year, a randomized controlled single blinded study comparing liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_876452] [ADDRESS_1224338]-operatively in the liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124195].    
b. State the applicant's prior research and experience in this research area. As a quality improvement initiative, we have 
retrospectively reviewed the effectiveness of TAP blocks with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_876453]-operative analgesia after laparoscopic asissted colectomy and open abdominal hysterectomy.  As members of 
the regional anesthesia division, we have extensive experience performing TAP blocks for a wide range of abdominal 
surgical procedures.  
  
4. SIGNIFICANCE:  State concisely the importance of this project by [CONTACT_564157], long-  
      range objectives.  Providing optimal post-operative analgesia to our patients is important to improve  
                         Page 12                                                   New Application: Revised 09-[ADDRESS_1224339]:    
a. State the inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrollment of subjects.   Inclusion criteria: elective open abdominal 
hysterectomy with a midline incision, age>18, ASA 1-3.  Exclusion criteria: patient with a chronic pain condition,  
major unexpected surgical complication, unexpected prolonged intubation, patient refusal, local anesthetic allergy, 
any contraindication to regional anesthesia, and greater than two attempts for TAP block by [CONTACT_876458].      
b. Describe the control population (if utilized) and justify its selection.Our current standard practice is to use 0.25% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354951], therefore, the control population is the group receiving 0.25% Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  
c. Support the likelihood of recruiting the number of subjects required to complete the project.  Relate this to other 
projects recruiting similar subjects.We estimate that 100-[ADDRESS_1224340] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39191].  We anticipate an 80% or higher recruitment rate.  Therefore, we 
anticipate recruiting [ADDRESS_1224341] DESIGN AND PROTOCOL:    
a. Describe the experimental design/methodology.Prospective randomized observer-blinded controlled study.   
b. Outline the protocol, corresponding it to the specific aims; identify the data or endpoints to be analyzed to reach the 
specific aims. All eligible patients will be seen in the pre-operative holding area to discuss the study.  Informed 
consent will be obtained at that time.  The patient will be randomized to one of three groups by [CONTACT_876459]. Group 1 will receive a TAP block with a total of 60 mL 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40473].  Group 2 will 
receive a TAP block with a total of 20 mL of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 40 mL normal saline.  Group 3 will receive a 
TAP block with a total of 20 mL of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 40 mL 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40473].  Our 
standard sedation protocol for all patients receiving any nerve block is to provide a maximum of [ADDRESS_1224342]-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and one time during each of the following time periods: 0-[ADDRESS_1224343] opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499], and pain score during the above mentioned time periods.  
Secondary outcomes are patient satisfaction, length of stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], timing of ambulation, presence of nausea and 
vomiting, evidence of local anesthetic toxicity and any postoperative hemodynamic instability.    
c. Discuss potential limitations and difficulties in the protocol.We don't anticipate any difficulties with this protocol 
since patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_128788] a TAP block for post-operative analgesia for open abdominal hysterectomy at Henry 
Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  One limitation of our protocol is that it is not double-blinded.  Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_876454].  Therefore, the anesthesiologist performing the block cannot be blinded to 
group selection.  All other care team members including anesthesia team, surgical team, and floor nurses, will be 
blinded to the group selection.   
d. Provide a tentative schedule for conducting and completing this project and, if applicable, the multicenter study.We 
anticipate one year to recruit patients and collect data.  Data analysis will take a few months after study completion.  
e. Data collection: Submit a copy of the data collection tool or list the data fields to be collected (review IRB policy, 
Access to Medical Records for Research).Age, ASA classification, height, weight, BMI, indication for hysterectomy, 
surgeon, duration of surgery, time of TAP block, time to first break-through analgesic, cumulative analgesic doses  
and pain scores at rest and with movement in PACU and in the following time periods: 0-[ADDRESS_1224344] 24hrs,then every 12 hrs for the next 24 hours.  Satisfaction (ie not satisfied, 
satisfied, very satisfied), length of stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], presence of ambulation, presence of nausea and vomiting, 
evidence of local anesthetic toxicity, presence of hypotension.  
  
7. DATA ANALYSIS:  Describe the analysis of the data and relate this to the specific aims in detail. Case reports and 
medical record reviews also require a description of the planned data analysis (ie. descriptive, observational). The 
Committee recommends free consultation with the Division of Biostatistics and Research Epi[INVESTIGATOR_876455]. Many clinical measurements will be recorded post operation. Some are one-time measurements such as total 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], and some are repeated measurements such as pain scores. Total 8-9 measuring times for those 
                         Page 13                                                   New Application: Revised 09-[ADDRESS_1224345] deviation and range. Frequency 
counts and percentage will be provided for categorical data. Estimates for averages and proportions will also include 95 % 
confidence intervals. One-way Analysis of Variance( ANOVA ) will be used to assess the efficacy of three anesthetic 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_876456] ( G1: bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301537]; G2: liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ; G3: liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + bupi[INVESTIGATOR_149146] ) on total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], patient satisfaction,  length of stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_876457]. 
Generalized Estimating Equations ( GEE ) will be utilized to evaluate the effects of these three anesthetic formulas on 
repeated measures of pain scores, presence of nausea and vomiting, evidence of local anesthetic toxicity and any 
postoperative hemodynamic instability. Cox proportion hazard models will be applied to assess the effect of these 
anesthetic formulas on the time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499]. The statistical analysis will be obtained by [CONTACT_4696] 9.4 
and the tests are claimed to be significant if the p- values are less than 0.05.

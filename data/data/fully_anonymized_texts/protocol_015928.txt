Primary Objective: The primary objective is to estimate the event-free survival (EFS) at 1 year after 
allogeneic in children and young adults with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) following hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT) from a haploidentical family donor.
Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives focus on the incidence of transplant-related toxicities. The 
latter include: time to neutrophil and platelet recovery; grades II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD); chronic GVHD; hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD); idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS); 
central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [PRES], hemorrhage, 
and seizures); the incidence of significant bacterial, fungal and viral infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus [CMV] 
reactivation and infection; adenovirus infection; Epstein Barr virus [EBV] post-transplant lymphoproliferative 
disease[PTLD]); and the incidence of stable mixed chimerism.
Study Design:  We will enroll and take to transplant [ADDRESS_1051930] a haploidentical 
donor.

Treatment Description: The HCT preparative regimen will consist of Hydroxyurea 30 mg/kg administered 
as a single daily dose PO on Days -100 through -10 (in patients not already receiving hydroxyurea as part of 
routine clinical care); Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 administered IV on Days -6 through -2 (total dose 150 mg/m2); 
antithymocyte globulin (ATG; rabbit) 0.5 mg/kg on day -9 and 2 mg/kg on days -8 and -7 (total ATG dose 4.5 
mg/kg); Thiotepa 10 mg/kg IV on day -7; Cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV on days -6 and -5 (total dose 29 
mg/kg); and total body irradiation [ADDRESS_1051937] of Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4, Sirolimus starting on day +5 and 
continued for 1 year, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 15 mg/kg/dose TID starting on day +5 and continued 
until day +35.  Patients unable to tolerate Rabbit ATG will receive an equivalent dose of horse ATG.
Stem cell source: Bone marrow grafts will be collected from haploidentical donors. The nucleated cell target 
range is between 8 to 16 × 108/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_12747], with the volume not to exceed 20 mL/kg donor's 
weight once the minimum target of 8 × 108/kg is reached.
Study Duration: Patients will be followed for 1-year post-transplant for study primary endpoints, functional 
measures and toxicity. Patients who meet a primary endpoint such as graft failure will be followed only for 
overall survival at one-year time point.
Data collection: Clinical events that occur during the one-year period of evaluation will be monitored, 
collected and analyzed. In addition, routine laboratory testing results that are performed in the course of 
standard medical monitoring will be collected. 
Sample size calculations for primary endpoint of 1-year EFS:  For this primary endpoint, we are focusing 
on the lower 95% exact binomial confidence bound to support our sample size of [ADDRESS_1051938]. We believe that if we observe 70% of the patients alive without events 
(defined as primary or late graft rejection, disease recurrence, or death) at one-year post-transplant, the 
outcomes are acceptable.
2. INTRODUCTION
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary anemia that affects tens of thousands of Americans and millions of 
individuals worldwide. It is associated with early mortality and a diminished quality of life, with intermittent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_767137], such as the lung, brain, spleen 
and kidney. Supportive health care measures instituted during childhood, which include newborn screening 
and pneumococcal prophylaxis, the administration of hydroxyurea and regular red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusions, have decreased the risk of serious infections and other life-threatening complications, resulting 
in improved survival to adulthood. This has, in part, shifted the demographics of SCD to include a growing 
proportion of young adults with chronic health impairments. As an alternative to chronic supportive care, 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor has 
been used sparingly in children but is curative in the majority of children treated2. As the outcomes from HCT 
have improved and the debilitating nature of SCD has been defined more completely, there is greater interest 
in expanding the applicability of HCT as a curative option for patients with SCD. A BMT Clinical Trials Network 
(BMTCTN) sponsored multicenter trial of unrelated donor HCT for children with severe SCD has recently 
completed enrollment. However, matched sibling or unrelated donors are available only to a minority of 
patients with SCD, the overwhelming majority of who belong to minority ethnic groups that are 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 8underrepresented in bone marrow donor registries. It is estimated that approximately 14% of eligible patients 
will have a matched sibling donor3 and 19% will find an 8/[ADDRESS_1051939] disease (GVHD) have made the use of haploidentical related donors 
feasible. The group from Hopkins has demonstrated that high dose cyclophosphamide administered early 
after bone marrow transplant effectively modulates alloreactivity associated with haploidentical donors5,6. 
Since hematopoietic stem cells have high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is the enzyme 
responsible for metabolizing cyclophosphamide, they are relatively protected from high dose 
cyclophosphamide, which simultaneously is highly toxic to lymphocytes. This permits the administration of 
the drug on days [ADDRESS_1051940] demonstrated the safety of haploidentical donor transplantation in a case series 
of adult patients with SCD10. While the treatment appeared to be well tolerated with minimal GVHD and 
treatment related complications, the failure of engraftment with autologous recovery occurring in 43% of 
patients remains a concern. The Hopkins group of investigators carried out a series of modifications of the 
protocol in response to the problems seen; these include the substitution of stimulated bone marrow as the 
stem cell source, the replacement of calcineurin inhibitors by [CONTACT_738609], and the addition of rabbit anti 
thymocyte globulin (ATG) as GVHD prophylaxis. Subsequent experience from Hopkins suggests that GCSF 
priming does not increase engraftment and may be associated with more GVHD (R Brodsky, personal 
communication). While most clinical trials of HCT for SCD have reported HCT specific outcomes such as 
overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS) and transplant related complications, there has been relatively 
limited study of sickle cell specific endpoints after HCT. This, on the one hand limits our ability to determine 
the impact of HCT on the biological course of SCD, and on the other hand, represent a lost opportunity to 
study the mechanisms of the development or regression of sickle cell related complications such as chronic 
pain syndromes or chronic organ dysfunction. We hypothesize that HCT from 3-[ADDRESS_1051941] 80%, and result in the stabilization or improvement of functional status related 
to SCD. 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-[ADDRESS_1051942] to the improvements 
in outcomes in childhood, there is a rapid progression in organ 
damage, morbidity and premature mortality in adulthood. 
Progression of organ damage in adulthood is marked by 
[CONTACT_767193], which occurs in 20-40% of adult patients 
with a 10 fold increase in risk of premature mortality7, renal 
insufficiency with proteinuria in 70% and progressing to renal 
failure in 11%, abnormal pulmonary function in 90% and 
progression to irreversible organ damage in 50% of patients by [ADDRESS_1051943] of adults with SCD develop chronic pain 
syndrome and only 20% are employed9,10. Death in adulthood is 
frequently related to organ damage which is not preventable or 
easily managed with current medical measures8. SCD related 
complications such as leg ulcers, stroke, priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], vascular 
necrosis, anxiety, and depression further worsen the health-
related quality of life. The mortality rate of patients with SCD is 5.8-
20% in the first 10 years after transition to adult care9,10. Premature 
death occurs at a median age of 38 years, a statistic that has not 
changed in 20 years 8,11,12 (Figure 1).   In a long-term follow-up 
study of patients with symptomatic SCD who were eligible to participate in the multicenter study of 
hydroxyurea (MSH), the annual mortality rate was 4.4 per 100 person-years among adults with SCD who 
satisfied eligibility criteria (4.4%).  Thus, the inexorable progression of disease and premature mortality in 
adulthood provides the rationale for expanding the applicability of HCT as a curative option for patients with 
SCD. 
3.2. Lack of curative treatments for adults with SCD provides the rationale for expanding the 
applicability of   HCT
HCT is the only curative treatment for this genetic blood disorder with excellent outcomes in children 16 years 
and younger.  Kaplan-Meier probabilities of survival and EFS are 93% and 85%, respectively, with a median 
follow-up of 6.3 years (range 3-12.4 years)2. Following successful HCT, there is a resolution of complications 
related to SCD with protection from epi[INVESTIGATOR_162803], stroke, or ACS, and in most patients, a stable 
appearance of cerebral MRI and pulmonary function tests and regeneration of the spleen13. The prevailing 
framework of clinical research in SCD shifts in the transition from childhood to adulthood. Among pediatric 
hematologists, the dominant view is that survival to adulthood is excellent, and that children, on average, 
have a very good quality of life as a result of supportive care measures such as antibiotics, family education, 
and the judicious use of transfusions. In addition, a great deal of effort has focused on identifying children 
who have high-risk features, so that the risk of any specific intervention might be balanced by [CONTACT_767194]. Thus, clinical research studies in children with SCD have focused primarily on 
safety and efficacy, often in the setting of a high-risk population, such as children at risk for a stroke. While 
HCT has curative potential, its routine application remains quite limited to children with SCD with matched 
sibling donors, which is due in part to its toxicities which include acute toxicity, a risk of secondary leukemia 
and infertility due to chemotherapy and a risk of dying from the procedure itself. As a result, clinical studies 
of transplantation in children with SCD have suffered from poor accrual, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_767138], HCT is 
not routinely considered in children with SCD.  
In contrast, the prevailing view among clinicians who care for adults is that SCD is, on average, a 
severe disease with a significant risk of sudden death and the development of chronic medical problems, and 
that supportive care options for young adult patients are not adequate to address the overwhelming nature 
of this disease. Thus, clinical studies in adults with SCD have focused on interventions that prolong survival

in adulthood in patients with SCD1.
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-[ADDRESS_1051944] a debilitating 
complication. As a result, the risk/benefit ratio of HCT is more favorable in adults, particularly if an approach 
to HCT that defines an acceptable level of toxicity can be established. Across the age span, the lack of access 
to a suitable HLA matched donor remains the single most critical barrier to the application of HCT to this 
condition. If successful, an approach to HCT using haploidentical donors could significantly improve the 
outlook of many patients with SCD and broaden the therapeutic choices.  
3.3. Critical barriers to the application of allogeneic HCT to patients with SCD 
The excellent outcomes in children with SCD treated by [CONTACT_767195] a trial of myeloablative HCT for adults in the early 1990s. Unacceptably high transplantation 
related morbidity and mortality was observed, which precipi[INVESTIGATOR_767139] a decade. In addition to the usual transplant-related 
toxicities, sickle cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_767140] (PRES)[ADDRESS_1051945]-based approach to treatment of adults with SCD; these include: (1) Increased risk of non-engraftment 
after HCT likely due to the fact that patients with SCD have not been previously exposed to multi-agent 
chemotherapy, are not immunosuppressed and have a hyperplastic bone marrow. The risk of graft rejection 
after HCT is approximately 10% when myeloablative chemotherapy is employed and higher when non-
myeloablative (NMA) regimens are utilized. (2) High risk of infertility as evidenced by [CONTACT_767196]-
HCT of primary ovarian failure in most post-pubertal females and oligo/azoospermia with FSH elevation 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_767141].[ADDRESS_1051946] by [CONTACT_767197][INVESTIGATOR_840]. (3) Limited donor availability because of the 
underrepresentation of minorities in the bone marrow donor registries. In 2003, approximately 59.7% of SCD 
patients and 80.2% of thalassemia patients were predicted to identify at least one potential marrow or 
umbilical cord blood (UCB) donor matched at 6/[ADDRESS_1051947] one marrow donor or an UCB unit that is potentially matched at 5/6 HLA loci16. However, for African-
Americans, the likelihood of finding an 8/[ADDRESS_1051948] for selection of 
donors especially is only 19%.4 (4) Slow accrual is a concern in clinical trials in SCD. [CONTACT_767230] 
analyzed 14 SCD studies that were successfully conducted outside an established clinical research network. 
These studies involved a median of 23 centers and 235 study participants, with a median time of 44 months 
to enroll (personal communication). This requirement was fairly consistent across all types of studies, except 
for pediatric studies, which required fewer sites. Even sites that enrolled as few as [ADDRESS_1051949] for children with SCD enrolled 30 subjects over 7 years. (5) Lack of empi[INVESTIGATOR_767142]. In SCD there is considerable variability in clinical phenotype, with 
few validated and specific predictors of disease progression or premature mortality. Ideally, in crafting HCT 
trials, a study design would rely upon a reliable predictor of early mortality as a method to ensure that the 
toxicity of transplantation was balanced by [CONTACT_767198]. In the 
pediatric HCT trial, consensus opi[INVESTIGATOR_767143]. Further, 
severity criteria for enrollment in a clinical trial represent an attempt to balance the risks of transplant related 
morbidity and mortality with that of the risks associated with the disease process. As such, eligibility criteria 
must also be informed by [CONTACT_767199]. As there are no accepted criteria for haploidentical donor HCT for SCD, a similar process would 
be required to develop and initiate a multi-center HCT trial in haploidentical donor HCT in patients with SCD 
with severe disease. 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-[ADDRESS_1051950] pneumococcal sepsis and comprehensive programs with a 
focus on family education together dramatically improved outcomes in children with SCD. Currently, 90% of 
US newborns with SCD survive to [ADDRESS_1051951] rapid disease progression that dramatically increases the risk of early 
mortality  
There is a steady decline in survival in patients with SCD that is observed by [CONTACT_428850]24. In patients 
with symptomatic SCD who met disease severity based eligibility criteria and participated in the multicenter 
study of hydroxyurea (MSH), the annual mortality rate was approximately 4% per year among adults with 
SCD25. In addition to the risk of early mortality, individuals with SCD who survive beyond the second decade 
of life are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_767144]. These include 
progressive vasculopathy, characterized by [CONTACT_767200], endothelial dysfunction, 
and intimal and smooth muscle proliferative changes in arterial conduits and major end-organ damage, such 
as chronic renal failure, hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke, avascular necrosis of the bones, and 
pulmonary hypertension26,27. Patients who experience a hemorrhagic stroke have a 26% risk of mortality 
within the first two-week period following the stroke28. Thus, the lack of supportive measures to halt disease 
progression in adulthood and eliminate premature mortality represents a clear and urgent rationale for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_767145].  
3.4.3. Novel approaches to HCT for hemoglobinopathies based on a combination of myeloablation 
and immunosuppression
NMA and reduced intensity conditioning regimens are now routinely used to establish engraftment of donor 
hematopoietic cells in adults with hematologic malignancies. The success of immunoablative but reduced-
intensity regimens suggests that an immunologic barrier rather than a requirement of “hematopoietic space” 
is a primary factor to ensuring engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cells. While NMA conditioning 
regimens have been successfully applied in adults with hematological malignancies, these have been far less 
successful in hemoglobin disorders. Over a decade ago, Lucarelli et al. described the effects of conditioning 
regimen dose intensity on overall transplant outcome in HCT for thalassemia. Conditioning regimens 
containing less than 200 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide (CY) resulted in decreased transplantation-related 
mortality with a concomitant increase in graft rejection.29 For example, in pediatric patients with class III 
disease, the incidence of graft rejection increased from 10% to 30% after reducing the CY dose to 120-160 
mg/kg. Sodani et al. successfully modified this regimen, resulting in a reduced rate of graft rejection from 30% 
to 8% by [CONTACT_2359] a combination of intensive hypertransfusion, hydroxyurea and chelation to reduce 
erythropoiesis and expansion of thalassemic clones well before transplantation, and by [CONTACT_767201] (Flu) and azathioprine to increase the level of immunosuppression.30 In another series focused 
on SCD, Krishnamurti et al. reduced the dose of busulfan (Bu) by 50%, substituted Fludarabine (Flu) for CY 
and included [ADDRESS_1051952] for SCD using the Bu-Flu backbone in 2 adults, one of whom 
had end stage renal disease32. Shenoy et al. substituted the alkylator Melphalan for BU in combination with 
Flu and Alemtuzumab observed long term stable engraftment in patients with non-malignant disorders 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 12(including SCD) treated by [CONTACT_767202] 33. Hsieh et al. demonstrated stable donor 
engraftment in adult SCD patients following NMA HCT from HLA-matched sibling donors. Low-dose total-
body irradiation (300 cGy) and alemtuzumab were administered before transplantation, and sirolimus was 
used for GVHD prophylaxis34. However, long-term administration of sirolimus at a median of [ADDRESS_1051953] has been to modify the myeloablative Bu/CY 
backbone of a conventional preparative regimen by [CONTACT_767203]. This approach has successfully 
reduced the toxicity of the conditioning regimen but retains very high rates of stable donor engraftment35-37. 
Taken together, these studies suggest that modified preparative regimens containing a combination of 
myeloablative and immunosuppressive drugs can be safely and effectively administered in adults with non-
malignant disorders.
3.4.4. Safety and efficacy of the post-transplant cyclophosphamide based GVHD prevention strategy 
for haploidentical HCT
Occurrence of GVHD previously was a major obstacle to the use of haploidentical donors for HCT. The safety 
and efficacy of haploidentical donor transplants have been greatly enhanced by [CONTACT_767204]. Strategies for prevention of GVHD focused on in vitro or in vivo T cell 
depletion. In vitro T-cell depletion of the graft, primarily through positive selection of CD34+ cells, has been 
shown to lead to high rates of engraftment and prevented both acute and chronic GVHD in haploidentical 
HCT38,39. However, the application of this approach has been limited by [CONTACT_767205]39. Recently a novel method of 
ex vivo T- and B-cell depletion based on the selective elimination of αβ+ T cells has been demonstrated to 
result in high rated of engraftment with limited GVHD and treatment related mortality in children with non-
malignant disorders40. The general applicability of this approach is however limited by [CONTACT_767206]. Haploidentical donor bone marrow transplantation with 
in vivo T-cell depletion with high-dose Cy has proven effective with very low rates of both acute and chronic 
GVHD by [CONTACT_767207]-malignant conditions in single and multicenter studies41. 
The use of GCSF mobilized bone marrow and the use of rabbit ATG may have contributed to low rate of 
GVHD in patients with SCD undergoing haploidentical HCT using the post-transplant CY approach5. 
However, subsequent experience from Johns Hopkins suggests that GCSF priming does not increase 
engraftment and may be associated with more GVHD (R Brodsky, personal communication). Substitution of 
calcineurin inhibitors with Sirolimus may have also contributed to decreasing the incidence of PRES. The 
reported rate of failure of engraftment at 43% remains a significant barrier to the general applicability of this 
approach, though it is possible that the protocol changes made during the study may mitigate this rate of non-
engraftment. Several factors may contribute to the rate of 10% or higher rate of non-engraftment in patients 
with SCD undergoing HCT, including the lack of prior myelosuppression or immunosuppression due to 
chemotherapy and the exposure to blood products. In an attempt to provide additional myelosuppression, we 
propose to add Hydroxyurea (HU) 30mg/kg/day for [ADDRESS_1051954] already previously received HU, we do not 
anticipate that this will significantly change the profile of tolerability of this regimen. To provide additional 
myelosuppression, we will add a single dose of Thiotepa 10mg/kg. These drugs have been well tolerated and 
have been shown to contribute to improved engraftment in Pesaro class III Thalassemia patients. The 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-[ADDRESS_1051955] in patients with SCD  which has been demonstrated to improve donor 
engraftment without significantly increasing morbidity or mortality and could dramatically expand curative 
options for individuals with SCD.44 In their experience 15 patients (including 2 with previous graft rejection) 
underwent haplo-BMT with this thiotepa-augmented conditioning regimen. At a median follow-up of 13.3 
months (interquartile range [IQR], 3.8 to 23.1 months), 93% (14 of 15) had >95% stable donor engraftment 
at 6 months, with 100% overall survival.
3.4.5. Immune reconstitution following haploidentical HCT using a reduced intensity conditioning 
regimen and post-transplant cyclophosphamide 
In the experience of the Hopkins group, post-transplantation recovery of lymphocyte subsets was notable for 
the following45: 1) The median lymphocyte count at day 30 after transplantation is 250/ml and recovers to 
over 1000/ml by [CONTACT_4475] 60; 2) CD4+ T cell counts recover to a median > 150/ml by [CONTACT_4475] 60 after transplantation; 
and 3) recovery of CD31+ recent thymic emigrants and CD45RA+ naïve T cells is delayed compared to 
recovery of memory T cells. Patients with a day 30 absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of > 200 cells/ul had a 
markedly improved OS (p = 0.008) and EFS (p < 0.0001) as compared with those patients with an ALC of < 
200. In conclusion, immune reconstitution after NMA haploidentical T cell replete HCT with post-
transplantation CY compares favorably with other reduced intensity conditioning regimens and T cell depleted 
haploidentical HCT, especially with regard to CD3+ and B cell numbers and may explain the low infectious 
complication rate. Analysis on 60 additional patient/donor pairs is currently being performed.
3.4.6. Impaired endocrine function and fertility related to SCD may be exacerbated by [CONTACT_767208] a pattern of growth and development consistent with constitutional 
delay of growth and puberty46. This pattern of growth is characterized by [CONTACT_767209], late onset of puberty with eventual attainment of final height consistent with mid parental 
height and full progression through puberty. Myeloablative HCT for SCD is associated with infertility in over 
80% of patients.[ADDRESS_1051956] 
demonstrate rates of 57-87% of patients with amenorrhea or ovarian failure2,48-50. There are occasional 
reports of late (> 10 years) resolution of hypergonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_767146]2,48.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_767147]. Anti-
mullerian hormone (AMH), considered a marker of ovarian reserve, has been reported to be undetectable 
after HCT with Bu based preparative regimens. These very low levels of AMH are compatible with severe 
diminished ovarian reserve. Many patients SCD patients after HCT had menopausal FSH levels and therefore 
were deemed to have premature ovarian insufficiency (Elchuri, Meacham et al., [ADDRESS_1051957] SCD BMT).
4. STUDY OVERVIEW 
The primary goal of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of HCT using a haploidentical donor 
in SCD patients who lack an HLA identical related donor. We will determine the 1-year EFS among 
patients treated by [CONTACT_417929], with events defined as graft failure/recurrent SCD or death. We will determine the 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-[ADDRESS_1051958].

family donor using a pre-transplant conditioning regimen of HU, Flu, ATG, Thiotepa, CY, and low dose TBI 
and GVHD prophylaxis with post transplantation CY, Sirolimus and MMF. Events for this endpoint will include 
primary and late graft failure, recurrence of SCD, and death. 
5.1.2. Secondary Objective
The secondary objectives of the clinical trial include determining the toxicity of HCT, for which we will measure 
the following: time to neutrophil and platelet recovery; grades II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD; chronic GVHD; 
VOD; IPS; CNS toxicity (PRES, hemorrhage, and seizures); the incidence of significant bacterial, fungal and 
viral infection (e.g., CMV reactivation and infection; adenovirus infection; EBV PTLD); and the incidence of

5.3 Donor Selection Criteria
Preference will be given to related marrow donors who are 2-4 (out of 8) HLA antigen mismatched and 
towards whom the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_767152]. Donors will sign an informed consent 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-[ADDRESS_1051965] 4 of 8 HLA alleles (HLA -A, -B, -C and -DRB1 by [CONTACT_265209]-level DNA 
methodology). The target total nucleated cell count (TNC) is 3.5-8.0 x 108/kg of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593]. Marrow will 
be collected without mobilization. Mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (HPC-A) collections will not be 
permitted. Donors must undergo hemoglobinopathy screening by [CONTACT_117142]; donors who have a 
hemoglobinopathy will be excluded but trait condition is acceptable.
5.4. Treatment Plan
All HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_767153] 1. Hydroxyurea, Thiotepa, 
Fludarabine, and Cyclophosphamide (pre- and post-transplant) dosing will be based on adjusted ideal body 
weight (AjBW) in patients weighing >125% IBW. The following are dose adjustment formulas with IBW in kg:
Males: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet.
Females: IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet.
AjBW = IBW + 0.4(ABW - IBW)
5.4.1. Pre-transplant procedures
[IP_ADDRESS]. HbS Level Prior to Start of Conditioning
Prior to the start of conditioning, patients who are not on a chronic transfusion protocol should receive EITHER 
a partial volume exchange transfusion (no more than 72 hours before the start of conditioning) OR simple 
transfusion(s) (starting one to two weeks before the start of conditioning). The transfusion should be tailored 
to achieve a HbS level < 30% and a Hgb to 9-[ADDRESS_1051966] ATG dose.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patients Receiving Iron Chelation Therapy Prior to HCT
Iron chelation therapy will be discontinued no later than 48 hours prior to commencement of the conditioning 
therapy (ATG). Iron chelation therapy or a program of phlebotomy may be resumed after neutrophil and red 
cell engraftment at the discretion of the transplanting center based on assessments of iron overload and 
GVHD (repeating liver iron quantification/biopsy at day 100 or later is recommended). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Back-up Bone Marrow
Because of the risk for graft failure, it 
is recommended that patients have an 
autologous bone marrow harvest prior 
to start of the preparative regimen. It is 
recommended that at least 2 x 108 
nucleated cells/kg are collected.
5.4.2. Preparative regimen
[IP_ADDRESS] Hydroxyurea
For patients not already receiving 
hydroxyurea as treatment for SCD, 
hydroxurea will be administered at a 
dose of 30 mg/kg PO as a single daily dose for 90 days (from day -100 to day-10). Hydroxyurea dosing will 
be based on AjBW in patients weighing >125% IBW (see above). Patients will be seen in clinic for a CBC 
every 2 weeks during this period of time, and the dose will be reduced if ANC <1500 or platelet count 
<100,000.Table 1: Schema of Conditioning Regimen for HCT Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_767154]

(approximately 30 mg/kg/day or >20mg/kg/d in setting of prior hydroxyurea associated toxicity) as treatment 
for SCD and who are being monitored by a physician for such, their dosing does not require adjustment. 
These patients will continue routine monitoring (e.g. CBC) with the physician who has prescribed 
hydroxyurea.
[IP_ADDRESS] Thiotepa
Thiotepa will be administered at a dose of 10mg/kg IV over 2 hours or per institutional guidelines on day -7. 
Thiotepa dosing will be based on AjBW in patients weighing >125% IBW (see above).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Fludarabine
Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day will be administered from day –6 to day –2 (for a total of 150 mg/m2 over 5 
consecutive days) and administered IV over a minimum of [ADDRESS_1051967] practice. In patients 
weighing > 125% IBW, Flu will be dosed based upon AjBW (see above).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cyclophosphamide
Cyclophosphamide will be administered on days -6 and -5 prior to bone marrow infusion at a dose of 14.5 mg/kg IV 
infused over 1-[ADDRESS_1051968] bone marrow infusion cyclophosphamide will be infused on days +3 (between 60- and 72-hours post 
marrow infusion) and +4 (approximately 24 hours after day +3 dose) at a dose of 50 mg/kg IV infused over 
1-[ADDRESS_1051969] day +4 cyclophosphamide.
For patients weighing more than 125% of their ideal body weight, dosing will be based on adjusted ideal body 
weight (see above). Supportive care for cyclophosphamide (hydration and the use of MESNA) should follow 
institutional practices.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rabbit ATG 
Rabbit ATG will be administered on day -9 at 0.5 mg/kg and on days -8 and -7 at 2 mg/kg (for a total dose 
4.5 mg/kg). ATG will be dosed on actual weight. Each vial of rabbit ATG lyophilized powder is reconstituted 
with 5 mL of soluble water for injection and transferred into the bag of infusion solution (saline or dextrose). 
It is recommended to use [ADDRESS_1051970] 4 hours for subsequent doses. Premedication with corticosteroids, 
acetaminophen and diphenhydramine 1 hour prior to the infusion is recommended to reduce the incidence 
and intensity of side effects during and after the infusion.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Total body irradiation
Patients will receive 200 cGy of TBI in a single fraction on day -1. Patients will receive lead shielding to 
minimize the toxicity of radiation to the gonads.
5.4.3. Infusion of Hematopoietic Stem Cells 
Institutional procedures should be followed for requesting and receiving marrow units for infusion. Under no 
circumstances are the marrow cells to be irradiated. No in-line leukocyte filter should be used and no 
medications or fluids should be given pi[INVESTIGATOR_767155]. 
Vital signs should be monitored before beginning the infusion and periodically during administration and in 
accordance with institutional guidelines. Pre-medications (if any) prior to BM infusion will be at the discretion 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 18of the transplant center. It is recommended that diphenhydramine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], hydrocortisone, and oxygen 
be available at the bedside for emergency use. 
5.5. GVHD Prophylaxis
5.5.1.   Sirolimus
Sirolimus will be administered beginning on day +[ADDRESS_1051971] 24 hours following completion of 
cyclophosphamide. Sirolimus will be continued through 1 year (day 365), at which point it can be discontinued 
without planned taper. In the case of unstable mixed donor chimerism or GVHD, the duration of Sirolimus 
administration alone or in combination with additional immunosuppressive agents may be modified at 
investigator’s discretion as dictated by [CONTACT_4676]’s condition. Please see Table 2 for age-based dosing and 
trough levels. Doses will be 
adjusted to maintain appropriate 
levels (HPLC or immunoassay) 
which should be measured weekly 
at a minimum.
5.5.2 Mycophenolate Mofetil
MMF will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg/dose TID beginning on day +5 and continued until day +35. The 
preferred route of administration is PO but it can be given IV if not tolerated PO.
5.5.3. Biomarkers
A biomarker panel consisting of ST2 and REG3α in a blood sample obtained seven days after HCT can 
identify patients at high risk for lethal GVHD ( Hartwell eat al JCI Insight. 2017 Feb 9; 2(3): e89798.). We 
will obtain a blood sample for GVHD biomarkers at day seven post HCT. The results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_767212]. The panel will also be repeated at onset of GVHD and will guide further management.
5.6. Supportive Care
Institutional practice guidelines should be followed after transplantation for nutritional support, treatment of 
infections, and blood product support. Additional supportive care guidelines are recommended below. 
Enrollment onto another clinical trial for treatment of transplant related complications (i.e. VOD, GVHD) does 
not require study pre-approval, but the PI [INVESTIGATOR_188739]. Enrollment on a clinical trial for non-treatment 
related purposes (i.e. addition of an immunosuppressive agent for GVHD prophylaxis or engraftment) does 
require study pre-approval. These trials are generally not allowed, but will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_767156]. 
5.6.1. Venous Access
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_331204]-term central venous access placed, per institutional standard practice, 
prior to beginning the conditioning regimen. The placement of a double lumen tunneled catheter is 
recommended.
5.6.2. Seizure Prophylaxis and Management of PRES
Prophylaxis against seizures is mandatory in all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_767157] (e.g. ATG). Suitable drugs for prophylaxis include lorazepam or levetiracetam and should be 
administered according to institutional guidelines. Serum magnesium level should be maintained >1.7 mg/dL 
to reduce the risk of seizures. There will be careful monitoring of blood pressure and prompt treatment of 
hypertension by [CONTACT_14181]-hypertensive agent(s) will be instituted. Suitable agents include amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_767158]; often multi-modal therapy is required to bring the BP in the normotensive range.
5.6.3. HypertensionTable 2. Sirolimus dosing and levels
Age Loading dose (day +5) Maintenance dose (day +6) Trough level
≥18 years 6 mg PO 2 mg PO Qday 5-15 ng/mL
<18 years 3 mg/m2 PO (max 6 mg) 1 mg/m2 PO Qday (max 2 mg) 5-12 ng/mL
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 19Hypertension should be strictly controlled to prevent CNS toxicity. Blood pressure should be monitored closely 
and both systolic and diastolic hypertension should be treated promptly to maintain blood pressure at the 
patient’s pre-transplant baseline ± 20%. Explicit orders must be written to intervene if systolic or diastolic 
blood pressure exceeds 20% over baseline.
5.6.4. Blood Products
The hemoglobin level must be maintained between 9.0 and 11.0 g/dL and platelet count 
> 50,000/mL after transplantation to minimize the risk of neurological adverse events. Irradiated blood 
products should be administered universally, and CMV negative or leuko-filtered blood products are 
recommended for CMV sero-negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. In those patients who do not receive chronic RBC 
transfusions or who have a HbS fraction > 30%, a partial exchange transfusion will be performed to reduce 
the HbS to ≤ 30% before commencing the conditioning regimen. The Hgb and % HbS should be re-checked 
4 hours after the exchange transfusion. 
5.6.5. Treatment of Fever/Infections
Patients should be monitored closely for clinical manifestations of infection and treated per institution 
guidelines with broad-spectrum antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agents. Early and severe 
immunosuppression of the patient necessitates prompt and adequate treatment of infections to prevent 
systemic spread. Patients are especially susceptible to bacterial and viral infections in the early post-
transplant period.
5.6.6. Infection Surveillance and Prophylaxis
Please use institutional guidelines for infection surveillance and prophylaxis. Where institutional guidelines 
do not exist, the following guidelines are recommended.
[IP_ADDRESS]. HSV prophylaxis
Acyclovir prophylaxis is recommended after transplantation until immune reconstitution in patients who are 
sero-positive for HSV or VZV. If unable to tolerate PO medications, IV therapy will be necessary. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. PCP prophylaxis
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or an equivalent drug should be administered beginning after neutrophil 
recovery and continued until there is full immune reconstitution.
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fungal prophylaxis
Due to the level of immune suppression, anti-fungal prophylaxis for candida and invasive mold infection is 
recommended with agents such as itraconazole, voriconazole, or posaconazole until day 180. Frequent 
monitoring of sirolimus levels will be necessary during azole therapy to avoid toxic drug levels. Voriconazole 
will be started on Day+[ADDRESS_1051972] of Casponfungin or Micafungin
[IP_ADDRESS] Bacterial prophylaxis
Prophylaxis against bacterial infections is generally not recommended. However, antibiotic prophylaxis 
according to institutional guidelines is acceptable.
[IP_ADDRESS]. CMV surveillance
All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_767159] (PCR) method beginning a week 
after commencing the conditioning regimen and until day 100. From day [ADDRESS_1051973] twice monthly. Antiviral therapy for CMV reactivation should commence preemptively if 
CMV testing reveals a high or rising viral load. Treatment of CMV should be undertaken per institutional 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 20guidelines. If CMV reactivation occurs at or before engraftment, foscarnet may be considered as an 
alternative to mitigate marrow suppression.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adenovirus guidelines
Testing for adenovirus infection in the blood by a PCR method is recommended in the event of symptoms 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_331206], hepatic dysfunction or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. If an active systemic 
infection is diagnosed, therapy should be instituted with cidofovir or other active agents per institutional 
guidelines.
[IP_ADDRESS]. EBV surveillance
All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_767160] 
14 to day 100. In the event of persistent EBV viremia or signs/symptoms consistent with EBV-related PTLD 
(adenopathy, fever, etc.), therapy with rituximab is recommended.
5.6.7. Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG)
IVIG may be administered according to institutional practice guidelines.
5.6.8. Fertility Preservation
Consideration should be made for fertility preservation prior to beginning these treatments. Cryopreservation 
of semen should be offered to all males Tanner III or more prior to gonadotoxic therapy. Cryopreservation of 
oocytes is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_767161]; for pubertal SCD patients, however, this time delay 
is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_767162]. Pubertal females, therefore, have the option of cryopreservation of oocytes. For 
prepubertal boys and girls, cryopreservation of gonadal tissue, which is experimental, is the only option to 
preserve fertility. Fertility consultation should be arranged for each patient prior to scheduling HCT with either 
a member of the Aflac Fertility Preservation team (for pediatric patients) led by [INVESTIGATOR_124].  or by 
[CONTACT_767213] (for adult patients). 
5.7. Graft Failure
Graft failure following HCT in patients with SCD is usually associated with autologous reconstitution of the 
bone marrow with host hematopoiesis. It is associated with a steady decline in donor chimerism, increasing 
representation of HbS (in the absence of ongoing RBC transfusion therapy) and clinical manifestations of 
SCD. A second transplant or donor cell infusion should not be considered unless the patient has < 20% donor 
chimerism.  
5.8. Toxicities of HCT
5.8.1. Toxicities related to the preparative regimen
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pancytopenia
The administration of Flu and CY is expected to produce pancytopenia with ANC < 500/μL, hemoglobin < 7-
8 gm/dL and platelet < 50,000/μL for as long as several weeks in most patients. Thus, these patients will 
require RBC and platelet transfusions until hematological recovery after HCT. In addition, many patients will 
develop fever and approximately 30% will develop a documented infection during the period of neutropenia. 
Complications related to pancytopenia may be life threatening or fatal.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Chemotherapy-specific toxicities
1. Fludarabine

BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 21Administration can cause hemolytic anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, low blood counts secondary 
to bone marrow suppression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, skin rash, pneumonitis, edema, fever, 
chills, fatigue, blurred vision, peripheral neuropathy, confusion, coma, decreased immunity and rarely 
encephalopathy (in very high doses).
2. Rabbit ATG
Thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG) is a purified, pasteurized, gamma immune globulin obtained by [CONTACT_767214] T-lymphocytes. Infusional toxicities include leukopenia, malaise, and PTLD. Chills and fever 
commonly occur in patients receiving ATG. Symptomatic treatment and temporary slowing of the infusion can 
usually manage minor toxicities. Pruritus and erythema occasionally develop. These symptoms are generally 
controlled with diphenhydramine. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_767163]. In such 
cases, the infusion should be discontinued. If reaction persists, diphenhydramine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_767164] a combination should be administered. Serum sickness syndrome may present with fever, 
arthralgias, and rash. Symptoms usually occur with some delay after initial ATG administration and treatment 
is with steroids. Other toxicities include pain in chest, flank or back which may be a sign of anaphylaxis or 
hemolysis. Infusion should be discontinued if anaphylaxis is suspected. Patients unable to tolerate rabbit ATG 
will receive an equivalent dose of horse ATG.
3. Cyclophosphamide
Common side effects include nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach upset, and loss of appetite. 
Occasional side effects include hemorrhagic cystitis and rare side effects include cardiac toxicity. Late 
sequelae include risk of infertility and risk of secondary malignancy.
4. Thiotepa
Side effects of thiotepa include fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, rash, alopecia, 
pain at injection site, asthenia, dizziness, blurred vision, headache, and seizures (at high doses).
5.8.2. Toxicities related to hematopoietic stem cell infusion
Infusion of allogeneic BM cells can result in shortness of breath, fever, hemolysis with renal dysfunction and 
back pain or anaphylaxis. To reduce the risk of reactions to product infusion, patients will be hydrated before 
and after administration of allogeneic BM and will be monitored closely before, during, and after infusion.
5.8.3. Toxicities related to GVHD prophylaxis
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sirolimus
Increased susceptibility to infection including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, 
and sepsis and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may 
result from immunosuppression. The rate of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease ranges from 0.7-3.2%. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy may occur particularly when sirolimus is combined with calcineurin inhibitors.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Mycophenolate Mofetil
Common side effects include constipation, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach upset, loss of 
appetite, gas, tremor, or trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
6. STUDY ENDPOINTS
6.1. Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is EFS at 1-year post-transplant. 
6.1.1. Event-free Survival
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 22EFS is defined as the survival with stable donor erythropoiesis with no new clinical evidence of SCD. Primary 
or late graft rejection with disease recurrence or death will count as events for this endpoint. 
6.1.2. Graft Rejection
Primary Graft Rejection: Primary graft rejection is defined as the absence of donor cells assessed by 
[CONTACT_767215] 42. Primary graft rejection can be accompanied by [CONTACT_767216].
Late Graft Rejection: The absence of donor hematopoietic cells in peripheral blood beyond day 42 in a patient 
who had initial evidence of hematopoietic recovery with > 20% donor cells will be considered a late graft 
rejection. 
6.1.3. Disease Recurrence
In the majority of cases in patients with SCD, failure of the allograft is followed by [CONTACT_767217], generally as a late graft rejection as defined 
above. Marrow aplasia with primary graft failure is uncommon. Disease recurrence is defined as the return of 
sickle erythropoiesis (HbS level > 70%) and the absence of donor cell representation. This may be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_767218], ACS, and VOC. 
6.2. Secondary Endpoints
Secondary endpoints are evaluations of the effects of HCT on clinical and laboratory manifestations of SCD 
at 1 year and evaluation of transplant-related outcomes. Secondary endpoints include the following: 
6.2.1. Overall Survival
OS is defined as survival with or without SCD after HCT.
6.2.2. Cumulative Incidence of Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment
Neutrophil Engraftment: Time to neutrophil engraftment is defined as the first of 3 measurements on different 
days when the patient has an absolute neutrophil count of  500/µL after conditioning.
Platelet Engraftment: Time to platelet engraftment will be defined as the first day of a minimum of 3 
measurements on different days that the patient has achieved a platelet count > 50,000/µL AND did not 
receive a platelet transfusion in the previous [ADDRESS_1051974] for SCD
Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood will be analyzed for variable number of tandem repeats 
(VNTR) to detect donor engraftment in myeloid and lymphoid fractions. 
6.2.4. Grade II-IV and Grade III-IV Acute GVHD
Incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD will be graded according to the CIBMTR consensus criteria 
(please see Appendix A).
6.2.5. Chronic GVHD
Incidence and severity of chronic GVHD will be scored according to the NIH consensus criteria.
6.2.6. Frequency of Transplant-related Complications 
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 231. IPS
IPS is diagnosed by [CONTACT_767219]:
a. Radiographic evidence of bilateral, multi-lobar infiltrates (by [CONTACT_13190] x-ray or CT scan); AND
b. Evidence of abnormal respi[INVESTIGATOR_767165] (SpO2) < 93% on 
room air or the need for supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation  93%; AND
c. Absence of active lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]
2. VOD
VOD is diagnosed by [CONTACT_46917] ≥ 2 of the following with no other identifiable cause for liver disease: 
a. Jaundice (direct bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL or > 34 μmol/L)
b. Hepatomegaly with right upper quadrant pain
c. Ascites and/or weight gain (> 5% over baseline)
3. CNS toxicity
CNS toxicity will be defined as seizures, CNS hemorrhage, or PRES. PRES is defined as an increased 
diffusion coefficient in areas of T2 hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging in the context of clinical 
symptoms or physical findings including headache, seizures, visual disturbances, and altered level of 
consciousness.
4. Infection
Significant infections will be recorded including but not limited to bacterial or fungal sepsis, CMV reactivation 
with/without clinical disease, adenovirus infection, EBV PTLD, other significant viral reactivations or 
community-acquired viral infections and invasive mold infections.
6.2.7. Frequency of Stroke
An overt stroke is defined as a focal neurologic event and neurologic deficit lasting > [ADDRESS_1051975] Protection
7.1.1. Risks to Subjects
Subjects Involvement and Characteristics: [ADDRESS_1051976] will be recruited.
Recruitment of Women and Minorities as Research Subjects:  Equal number of women and men are 
likely to be recruited. The majority of patients will be of minority ethnic origin because of the demographics of 
distribution of SCD. The racial, gender and ethnic characteristics of the proposed subject population reflects 
the demographics of the study sites. We shall attempt to recruit subjects in respective proportion to these 
demographics. No exclusion shall be based on race, ethnicity, or gender.
Inclusion of Children as research subjects: Previous studies have demonstrated the benefit of HCT for 
children from matched sibling donor in children up to age [ADDRESS_1051977] as that presented by [CONTACT_767220]. 
Expertise of the investigative team in dealing with patients of the specific age ranges: Investigators 
are Board Certified in Pediatric or Adult Hematology/Oncology/HCT with experience in taking care of 
hemoglobinopathy patients and HCT patients. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_767166]. 
Potential Risks: HCT is the only modality that can cure SCD. If HCT is successful, it is anticipated that 
patients will not have symptoms related to the disease, have no requirement of transfusion and have 
stabilization of organ damage. The risk of mortality is low in patients < [ADDRESS_1051978] from 
matched siblings (4-5%)51. Risks are higher among older patients and those receiving HCT from an unrelated 
donor. Published data from Hopkins suggest that this protocol is well tolerated in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_767167] a 
mismatched family donor. However, serious viral or bacterial infections and acute and chronic GVHD pose 
significant risks of morbidity and mortality even in patients receiving HCT following an NMA conditioning 
regimen. While there is no information available on the effect of this regimen on fertility, the use of high doses 
of alkylator (CY alone) in HCT conditioning regimens was associated with recovery of ovarian function in all 
patients under the age of 26 years and in 61% of patients over the age of [ADDRESS_1051979] half of the 
patients with aplastic anemia transplanted and survived ≥ 2 years preserved or regained the ability to become 
pregnant or father children54. It is estimated that in the current regimen the risk of infertility will be 50% or 
less. There is a small risk (<5%) for a malignancy and potential for late toxicity includes infertility. 
Discussion of Alternatives to participation in the study: Patients and parents will be clearly apprised of 
alternatives to participation on the study. We will discuss risks and benefits and current outcomes of alternate 
modalities of treatment such as conventional myeloablative HCT, chronic transfusion, HU or supportive care.
7.1.2. Protection Against Risks
Adequacy of Protection Against Risks: Subjects for this study will be recruited from among patients 
followed at or referred to the clinical sites. The study will be discussed with the patient or family members by 
[CONTACT_767221]. All patients will sign informed consent according to 
guidelines of the local Institutional Review Board. Patients will be initially evaluated and their Hematologist 
will initiate the consent process in the context of ongoing medical care. A trusted non-medical member of the 
team such as an educator or social worker will interview patients to confirm patients and families have explicit 
consent of further evaluation for HCT. 
Protection against Risk: This protocol will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_767222] (21CFR Part 56). IRB approval of any future modifications of the protocol or 
consent form for this study will be given in writing. Unanticipated adverse effects will be reported to the IRB. 
The IRB will receive notification of the completion of the study. Investigators will maintain an accurate and 
complete record of all submissions made to the IRB, including a list of all reports and documents submitted.
Risk Management Procedures: Procedures for minimizing specific risks associated with study procedures 
are outlined above. Patients will be admitted to the HCT inpatient unit and will receive standard care. Once 
engraftment has been demonstrated, the patients will be followed closely in the outpatient clinic. In addition, 
one of the investigators will be available by [CONTACT_767223] [ADDRESS_1051980] of the donor to serve as a bone 
marrow donor, he/she will not be used as a donor. All donors will undergo screening procedures including 
blood tests (approximately 10-15 ml), a urinalysis, pregnancy test (for female donors of child bearing potential) 
and any tests clinically indicated for the safety of the donor during general anesthesia. The risks involved in 
the screening procedures include discomfort from phlebotomy. Since the bone marrow donation occurs under 
general anesthesia, there is some risk associated with anesthesia. The most common side effects related to 
the collection of bone marrow are: pain in the hip bones, back stiffness and bruising and bleeding in the skin 
where the needles were placed. Rare complications include infections in the skin and bone or major bleeding 
problem. It is possible that a blood transfusion will be necessary so that the donor is not too anemic after the 
bone marrow collection. In some cases, it will be possible to collect blood in advance from the donor and 
store it so that it can be given after the bone marrow collection. There is also a potential for psychological 
distress to the donor in case of serious HCT related complications to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].
Measures that will be taken to minimize the risks of procedures: 
1. Every effort will be made to use aseptic technique as well as measures to minimize the discomfort 
from phlebotomy, including the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_767168].
2. Pregnancy tests will be done prior to any radiological procedure.
3. Adequate pre-, intra- and post-operative analgesia will be ensured in order to minimize the risk of 
pain.
4. Appropriate aseptic technique will be used to minimize the risk of infections. 
5. Appropriate anesthetic technique and monitoring will be ensured to minimize the risk from 
anesthesia.
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 266. Where the patient is eligible for autologous blood donation (e.g., donors >16 years of age and 
weighing > 50 kg), we would recommend that this be done so as to limit the possibility of requiring 
transfusion from an allogeneic donor. 
7. Blood will be placed on hold with the Blood Bank should the patient become anemic and require a 
transfusion.
8. A psychologist will be available to see the donor prior to donation and will be available subsequently 
to address any behavioral and/or psychological consequences of bone marrow donation.
Donation of bone marrow has no prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects but represents an opportunity 
to understand, prevent, and alleviate SCD which is a serious problem affecting the health and welfare of 
children and adults. Even though the procedures that the possibly minor donors are asked to undertake are 
considered greater than minimal risk, donors have a strong emotional bond with the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55050] a genuine 
likelihood that their donation could benefit the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_767169], they themselves also stand to benefit 
psychologically in an important manner. The research will be conducted in accordance with sound ethical 
principles and adequate provisions will be made for soliciting the assent of children and the permission of 
their parents/guardians. As such, this meets the requirements of Subpart D §46.405. 
7.2. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
This study will be centrally reviewed by [CONTACT_86792] (DSMB) of the Aflac Clinical 
Research Office. The DSMB will meet quarterly to review all serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths and 
to determine whether any patient safety problems necessitate protocol modifications or discontinuation of the 
trial. The DSMB will also meet on an ad hoc basis if unexpected safety events occur that may necessitate 
study suspension or closure. The DSMB will discontinue the review of outcomes when this protocol is closed 
to accrual. If the DSMB recommends protocol or informed consent changes during the study, the 
recommendations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_767170]. 
All SAEs must be submitted to the designated Aflac Clinical Trials Coordinator within 24 hours. The DSMB 
will appoint an independent safety monitor who will review submitted SAEs immediately as they are reported, 
with follow-up through resolution. The monitor will also evaluate individual and cumulative participant data, 
and will provide recommendations to the DSMB regarding the safe continuation of the study. The monitor will 
notify the DSMB of any findings of a serious and immediate nature including any recommendations to 
discontinue all or part of the trial. In addition, the monitor will communicate findings, any concerns and 
recommendations during the quarterly DSMB meetings. Before each regularly scheduled DSMB meeting, the 
study coordinator will submit a report including tabular summaries of all reported SAEs, and deaths on study 
to date. The report will also include a brief summary of each previously unreported SAE and death, including 
an assessment of whether the event was unexpected or related to the study. 
7.3. Adverse Events
Definitions :
Adverse event (AE): any untoward medical occurrence regardless of causality assessment. An AE 
can be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
syndrome or disease.  
Serious adverse event (SAE): when the AE 1) results in death, 2) is considered life-threatening, 3) 
results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_767171], 4) results in permanent disability 
or irreversible impairment, 5) leads to a congenital anomaly, or 6) represents a significant medical 
condition which, without urgent medical intervention, would lead to one of the above outcomes. Life-
threatening means that the AE represented an immediate threat of death without medical intervention. 
For the purposes of this study, non-engraftment, graft rejection and late graft failure shall always be 
considered SAEs regardless of their impact on the patient’s condition.  
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 27Unexpected adverse events: events whose nature, severity, or frequency is inconsistent with what 
is known about the patient’s prior medical history or the possible adverse effects of HCT. 
Expected adverse events: AEs that are anticipated to occur due to the patient’s disease or due to 
HCT. Expected adverse events usually considered to be related to intensive pre-transplant 
conditioning, allogeneic grafts and GVHD prophylaxis include serious bacterial and fungal infections, 
VOD, complications arising from GVHD and its treatment, IPS and complications arising from oral or 
gastrointestinal mucositis. Such events may be deemed expected. Adverse events associated with the 
previous treatment of a patient’s SCD may, likewise, be deemed expected. 
Unanticipated problems (UP): include unexpected AEs and also unexpected problems, events, or 
new information which are not AEs but which indicate that research participants or others are at greater 
risk of harm than previously believed prior to recognition of the unanticipated problem.
Characterizing an adverse event: Adverse events will be described using event terms and severity grading 
from the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 (November 27. 2017). The 
expectedness of the event (see above) and the relation of the event to the study drug shall also be 
characterized.
The relation or attribution of the event to the investigational product may be characterized as follows: 
Definitely related, clearly associated with study drug
Probably related, likely associated with study drug
Possibly related, may be associated with study drug
Unlikely to be  related, or
Definitely not related to the study drug
Adverse Event Reporting: All SAEs occurring through day 100, whether expected or unexpected, will be 
reported in an expedited manner to the designated Aflac Clinical Trials Coordinator within [ADDRESS_1051981] will be monitored and recorded using NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 (November 27. 2017) at regular intervals (e.g., post-transplant 
timepoints). Adverse Events of interest include infections, GVHD, CNS toxicities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or any 
event considered by [CONTACT_152391] (i.e. with clinical manifestations or requiring 
treatment or clinical management).
Monitoring of SAEs, unexpected problems and IREs: The CRO will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_767172] a report. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_767173], 
expectedness, and attribution to ensure the accuracy and completeness of reports.

SCD.  
8.2. Efficacy Endpoint
The rate at which patients are alive with donor erythropoiesis (EFS) at [ADDRESS_1051995] confirmed date for either type of event to 
determine EFS. All patients without events will be followed for a minimum of one year so that no patients will 
be censored prior to the 1-year time point; this permits 1-year EFS to be defined as a binary end point.
The goal of the study is to demonstrate a 1-year EFS in the neighborhood of 70%. If the study enrolls 15 
patients, we will achieve that goal if 11 or more of 15 patients are alive with donor erythropoiesis at one year. 
This corresponds to an EFS at one year of 73% or higher. If 11 patients are alive without graft failure or 
recurrence at one year, the lower 10% exact binomial confidence bound for this result is 54%, suggesting 
that this finding is consistent with an approach in which more than half of patients would derive clinical benefit.
8.[ADDRESS_1051996] event among 
primary graft failure, secondary graft failure, disease recurrence, or death. All patients without events will be 
followed for a minimum of one year so that no patients will be censored prior to the 1-year time point. In 
addition, the frequencies of each component of the composite endpoint (primary graft failure, secondary graft 
failure, and disease recurrence) will be described. 
8.8 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Overall survival: The survival distribution will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761]-Meier curve. All patients will be 
followed for a minimum of one-year post-transplant for mortality.
Incidence of red cell, neutrophil, and platelet engraftment: To assess the incidence of each type of 
engraftment from the day of transplant, a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% 
confidence interval at [ADDRESS_1051997]-transplant. Death prior to each type of engraftment will be considered 
as a competing risk. 
Acute GVHD: To assess the incidence of grades II-IV or grades III-IV acute GVHD from the day of transplant, 
the first day of acute GVHD onset of either grades II-IV or grades III-IV will be used to calculate a cumulative 
incidence curve for that acute GVHD grade. A 95% confidence interval at [ADDRESS_1051998]-transplant will be 
computed. Death prior to development of acute GVHD will be considered as a competing risk. 
Chronic GVHD: To assess the incidence and severity of chronic GVHD from the day of transplant, a 
cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval at one-year post transplant. 
Death prior to occurrence of chronic GVHD will be considered as a competing risk.
Transplant-related complications: The frequency of transplant-related complications, both overall and by [CONTACT_767228], will be described using proportions along with 95% confidence intervals.
Disease-related complications: The frequency of disease-related complications (such as stroke, development 
of overt nephropathy, change in albuminuria and renal function) will be described using proportions along 
with 95% confidence intervals.
Exercise Capacity: We will use the 6MWD, testing under standardized procedures, to assess exercise 
capacity.[ADDRESS_1051999] to examine the change in distance walked within subjects.
BMT TRANSFORM Protocol vers 09-22-2020 35Cardiac Function: We will measure changes in TRJV over time. We will again rely on a t-test as well as on a 
linear mixed model (Desai) for the rate of change in TRJV while incorporating both transplant status and 
baseline value. As a planned subset analysis, we will also examine the magnitude of changes in the subset 
of patients who experience increases over baseline measurements.
Pulmonary Function: Subjects will undergo PFTs at baseline (pre-HCT) and at 1-year post-HCT. We will use 
both the paired t-test and generalized linear models to assess changes in PFTs, but we have no estimates 
of variability over time on which to base power calculations at this time. We will also assess the proportion of 
transplanted subjects in whom we find evidence of restrictive lung disease, defined as TLC below the 5th 
percentile adjusted for age, gender, race, and height, as is also reported by [CONTACT_113373].
Renal Function: We will measure albuminuria. Guasch reports that 61% of SCD subjects aged [ADDRESS_1052000].
Pain 
Pain will be assessed using a 1-week multi-dimensional pain diary. The time-points will coincide with collection of 
other PROs (such as PROMIS). Data entry will occur two times per day, morning and evening and it is anticipated it 
will take less than 3-5 minutes to fill out at each time point. Electronic reminders will be sent to participants twice daily 
to report their pain data. Follow up phone calls will be done by [CONTACT_767229] (forgotten password, inability to log in, etc.). It is possible that the full  week of pain data may 
not be completed due to scheduling priorities related to transplant and post BMT. In these situations, pain data will be 
collected for maximum allowable days at each time point, up to 1 week. 
 
HRQoL 
To assess HRQoL, Patient Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS®)  PROMIS 25 measures will 
be used for subjects < 18 years old; while, PROMIS  29 will be used for subjects 18 and over.  PROMIS® contains a 
number of self-report forms that each assess domains of physical and emotional function over a seven-day time 
interval. 
8.9 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]
8.9.1 Overall mortality by [CONTACT_4475] 100 and at 1 year
Overall mortality by [CONTACT_4475] 100: For the transplanted patients, overall mortality in this trial is projected to be 
less than 20% at day 100. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_767178] 100-day overall mortality rate exceeds 15% based on the truncated sequential probability ratio 
(SPRT). The truncated SPRT is based on contrasting 15% versus 30% 100-day mortality, with nominal type 
I and type II error rates of 10% and 20%, 
respectively. The common slope of the 
parallel lines is 0.219 and the intercept 
for the upper boundary is 2.344. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334189] 7. 
Overall mortality at 1 year: The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_767179] 1 year will be

chimerism) by [CONTACT_4475] 100 should occur in < 30% of the patients. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_767182] 100 
will be triggered if there is significant evidence that the day 100 graft rejection rate exceeds 30% based on 
the truncated SPRT. The truncated SPRT is based 
on contrasting 30% versus 50% 100-day graft 
rejection, with nominal type I and type II error rates of 
15% and 20%. The common slope of the parallel lines is 0.[ADDRESS_1052002] disease at day 100 will be triggered if there is significant 
evidence that the grade III -IV GVHD rates exceed 30% based on the truncated SPRT. The truncated 
SPRT is based on contrasting 25% versus 35%, respectively, with nominal type I and type II error rates of 
15% and 20%. The common slope of the parallel lines is 0.[ADDRESS_1052003] and 0.322 and 2.415 for patients with MUD. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_767183] 10. 
8.9.4 Disease recurrence by [CONTACT_4475] 100
The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_767184] 100 will be triggered if there is significant evidence that the 
disease recurrence rates exceed 30% based on the truncated SPRT. The truncated SPRT is based on 
contrasting 25% versus 35%, respectively, with nominal type I and type II error rates of 15% and 20%. The 
common slope of the parallel lines is 0.[ADDRESS_1052004] 100 days after transplant. We rank the four kinds 
of AEs according to the severity, i.e., disease recurrent < grade III-IV host disease <graft rejection <overall 
mortality. We treat a high-level event of AE as a lower-level event, then count the number of events during 
the study and check the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_767185] 11, Table 10, Table 9, and Table 7 to see whether 
terminate the trial. For example, 2 of 9 patients will be dead by [CONTACT_4475] 100, and 3 of 9 patients will be graft 
rejection by [CONTACT_4475] 100, 1 of 9 patients will be disease recurrence by [CONTACT_4475] 100. In this case, the number of events 
is 2+3+1=6. We should stop the clinal trial according to Table 11.  Table 9. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_767186] 100

appoint an independent safety monitor who will review submitted SAEs immediately as they are reported, with follow-
up through resolution. The monitor will also evaluate individual and cumulative participant data, and will provide 
recommendations to the DSMB regarding the safe continuation of the study. The monitor will notify the DSMB of any 
findings of a serious and immediate nature including any recommendations to discontinue all or part of the trial. In 
addition, the monitor will communicate findings, any concerns and recommendations during the quarterly DSMB 
meetings.
8.9.8. Modification of conditioning regimen
If a decision is made to stop accrual under the initial GVHD regimen, due to excessive GVHD then 
we will stop accrual.  If the DSMB approves we will consider modifying the GVHD prophylaxis with 
the substitution of Tacrolimus for sirolimus.

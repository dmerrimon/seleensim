1.1 Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis  
Systemic light -chain amyloidosis  (AL) is a protein conformation disorder due to a clonal plasma 
cell dyscrasia.2  In both AL and multiple myeloma  (MM), clonal plasma cells in the bone 
marrow produce monoclonal immunoglobulins.3,[ADDRESS_1203270] and peripheral nervous system.7 The 
deposits lead to multiorgan dysfuncti on and death. The annual incidence of AL is estimated to be 
six to nine per million. The prognosis of AL is poor, with a median survival without therapy of 
approximately 13 months from diagnosis and a 10 -year survival rate of 5%. Survival can be 
prolonged with effective treatment.8,9 
Therapy of AL is generally based on treatment regimens used in MM. The aim of therapy is to 
eliminate the clo nal plasma cells in order to reduce the production of abnormal light chains. 
Reduction in the amyloid -precursor light chains in the serum can lead to resorption of amyloid 
deposits in tissues and restoration of organ function. Achievement of a hematologic response is 
associated with improved outcome, and a complete hematologic response (C HR) has been shown 
to prolong survival.[ADDRESS_1203271] therapy for patients who 
do not undergo autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT) remains oral melphalan and 
dexamethasone ( MDex),13 which achieve s a hematologic response rate of 67%, including 33% 
complete response/remission ( CR).  
Median survival for those who do not respond to initial therapy with melphalan and stem cell 
transplant is [ADDRESS_1203272] an 
abnormal configuration, novel agents that interfere with intracellular protein quality control 
 CONFIDENTIAL  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
   
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_1203273] a role in the treatment of AL. Interference with cellula r quality 
controls in cells that secrete abnormal proteins can cause increased intracellular stress and may 
trigger cell death. Recently, for example, in the phase I portion of a phase I/II trial with the 
proteasome -inhibitor bortezomib in AL patients with  relapsed disease, 63% overall and 38% 
CHR rates were achieved.[ADDRESS_1203274]. 
Palladini and colleagues enrolled 24 patients with relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis who were 
previously treated with Melphalan, bortezomib, and thalidomide (Ann Hematol 2 012 Vol 91: 89 -
92).  In this protocol, patients received lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Hematologic response 
defined as partial response or higher was seen in 9 out of 24 subjects (41%). There were no 
complete responses seen. In a follow -up study (Palladi ni et al. Haematologica 2013; Vol 98 p 
433-5), twenty -one patients who had relapsed or refractory AL Amyloidosis received treatment 
with cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. Hematologic response was seen in 
62% of patients, but there was only  one complete response (5%).  
Since the immunoglobulin light chain proteins made by [CONTACT_863104], they may require optimal intracellular protein quality 
control management. Impairment of intracellul ar chaperone and protein -processing quality 
controls could cause increased intracellular  stress due to protein misfolding and aggregation, 
thereby [CONTACT_863105]. Bendamustine may interfere with protein chaperone and quality 
controls in AL plasma ce lls by [CONTACT_863106].

be associated primarily with the parent compound. The t(1/2) of bendamustine is approximately 
[ADDRESS_1203276] reported, however, that bendamustine has little cross -resistance 
with other alkylating agents and remains active even in extensively pretreat ed patients.  
Bendamustine has been approved in Europe for treating MM, non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL), 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. It is of note that 
bendamustine was developed and approved in East [LOCATION_013] in 1971.  Dose-limiting toxicity  
(DLT) is primarily hematologic. Treatment -associated infections have been reported in some 
studies; however, nonhematologic adverse events  (AEs) have rarely been dose limiting. The 
most common nonhematologic AEs include fatigue, nau sea, xerostomia, and pyrexia.  
 CONFIDENTIAL  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
   
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_1203277] shown that Bendamustine is >95% protein bound, but this binding 
is not affected by [CONTACT_654] (>70years), low serum albumen levels (<3.1 g/dl) or the presence of 
advanced tumors 33.  
Bendamustine was appr oved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) for the treatment 
of CLL in March 2008 and for the treatment of rituximab -refractory, indolent B -cell NHL in 
October 2008.  
FDA approval for use in CLL was based on findings from a randomized, open -label, Phase III 
study comparing bendamustine with chlorambucil as single -agent therapy in treatment naive 
patients with CLL (Binet stage B or C)  29, 30. Bendamustine was administered intravenously at a 
dose of 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2, while chlorambucil was admi nistered orally at 0.8 mg/kg 
daily, both over 4 -week cycles for up to 6 cycles. At interim analysis (the data used for FDA 
approval), bendamustine was associated with a greater ov erall response (68% vs 39%; P <0.001), 
median progression -free survival (21.7  vs 9.3 months; P <0.001) and median duration of 
remission (18.9 vs 6.1 m onths; P <0.001) compared with chlorambucil. FDA approval for 
rituximab refractory, indolent B -cell NHL followed a Phase III, open -label, single -arm study 
evaluating bendamustine mono therapy in patients who did not respond to rituximab or who had 
progressive disease within 6 months of rituximab therapy. Bendamustine 120 mg/m2 was 
administered intravenously on days 1 and 2 of a 21 -day cycle for up to 8 cycles. At interim 
analysis, the o verall response rate was 84%, including 29% CR. The median progression -free 
survival was 9.[ADDRESS_1203278] used in  1969 in [LOCATION_013]. A randomized phase 
III study compared bendamustine and prednisone (BP) to standard melphalan and prednisone 
(MP) treatment in previously untreated patients with MM  31. To be included, patients had to have 
histologically and cytologically proven stage II with progressive disease or stage III MM. They 
were randomly assigned to receive BP (n=68) or MP (n=63). The primary endpoint was the  time 
to treatment failure  (TTF). Secondary endpoints included survival, remission rate, toxicity and 
quality of life. The overall response rate was 75% in the BP and 70% in the MP group. A 
significantly higher number of patients treated with BP achieved a complete remission than did 
patients receiving MP (32 vs. 13%; P =0.007), and the maximum response was ach ieved more 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_863082] (6.8 vs. 8.7 cycles; P <0.02). 
TTF and remission duration were significantly longer in the BP group. Patients receiving BP had 
higher quality of life  scores and reported pain les s frequently than patients receiving MP. The 
authors concluded that BP is superior to MP with respect to complete remission rate, TTF, cycles 
needed to achieve maximum remission and quality of life and should be considered the new 
standard in first -line treatment of MM patients not eligible for transplantation.17

treated with bendamustine as salvage the rapy. After a median 2 lines of prior therapy (range:  1-
5) patients received a median 3 (range: 1 -10) cycles of bendamustine. Bendamustine dose was 
80-150 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of a monthly cycle. Bendamustine was administered as 
monotherapy in 39% of pati ents, whereas 61% received concomitant steroids. Toxicity was mild 
to moderate. Response rates were as follows: 3% very good partial response (VGPR),  33% 
partial response ( PR), 18% minor response (MR), 26% stable disease ( SD) and 20% progressive 
disease. The median event -free and overall survival s (OS) were 7 and 17 months, respectively. 
The authors concluded that in patients with advanced MM, bendamustine is effective and 
associated with mild toxicity.18 
In another study, 17 patients with relap sed MM with a median age of 70 years (51 -82) were 
treated with bortezomib 1 -1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8 and 11; bendamustine 60 mg/m2 on days 1 
and 8; and dexamethasone [ADDRESS_1203280] On cology Group ( SWOG) criteria. The overall response rate 
(CR+PR+MR) was 88%. CR: (n=2; 12%), PR: (n=10; 58%), MR (n=3; 18%; No Change (n=2; 
12%). A total of 28 patients with a median age (range) of 64 years (40 -78) have been enrolled in

complete remission, 1 near CR, 5 VGPR, 15 PR, and 1 MR. Two patients had stable disease and 
one was refractory. After a median follow up of 15 months, event free survival  and OS at 12 
months were 34% and 92% respectively.  
Our group performed a phase 1 trial using bendamustine combined with lenalidomide . Our 
primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of 
bendamustine and lenalidomide when administered with dexamethasone for patients with  
relapsed or refractory MM. Patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_1203282] been enrolled; [ADDRESS_1203283] been treated (median age 61 years [range, 38 -75 years]). The maximum tolerated

Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Tumor lysis syndrome associated  with bendamustine treatment has been reported in  patients in 
clinical trials and in spontaneous reports. The onset tends to be within the first  treatment cycle of 
bendamustine and, without intervention, may lead to acute renal failure  and death. Preventiv e 
measures include maintaining adequate volume status, and close  monitoring of serum chemistry, 
particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol  has also been used prior to or at the 
beginning of bendamustine therapy. However, there  may be an incre ased risk of severe skin 
toxicity when bendamustine and allopurinol are  administered concomitantly.  
Skin Reactions  
Skin reactions have been reported in clinical trials and post -marketing spontaneous  reports. 
These events have included rash, toxic skin reac tions, and bullous exanthema.  Some events 
occurred when bendamustine was given in combination with other  anticancer agents, so the 
precise relationship of the skin reactions to bendamustine  treatment is uncertain.  
In a study of bendamustine (90 mg/m2) in combination with rituximab  (study SDX -105-02), 1 
case of toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] ( TEN) occurred. TEN has been associated with treatment  with 
rituximab. Spontaneous reports of Stevens Johnson Syndrome ( SJS) and TEN, some fatal, have 
been reported  when ben damustine was administered concomitantly with allopurinol and other  
medications known to cause these syndromes. The relationship to bendamustine cannot  be 
determined.  
When skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further  
treatment. Therefore, patients with skin reactions should be monitored closely. If skin  reactions 
are severe or progressive, bendamustine treatment should be withheld or  discontinued.  
1.3 Study Rationale and Selection of Drug Doses 
There are no established and  approved second -line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863083] -based treatment, be it high -dose melphalan with stem cell 
transplant or oral melphalan and dexamethasone (MDex) . Therefore new treatments are needed 
for those who fail initial therapy and for those who initially respond but subsequently relapse.  
 CONFIDENTIAL  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
   
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_1203285] a tendency to self -assemble and aggregate. Thus eradication or the 
control of the abnormal plasma cell clone is the precondition for successful treatment of AL 
amyloidosis. Bendamustine, a bifunctional alky lating agent with high anti -myeloma activity, 
achieves a PR in 70% of patients with relapsed/refractory MM . Based on this high anti -MM 
activity, we anticipate that bendamustine will also be very active in clonal plasma cell disorder 
associated with AL.  
MM and AL are plasma cell dyscrasias which receive similar treatment, e.g. melphalan, steroids, 
high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant . Substances testing positive for 
anti-MM activity are also used for the treatment of AL,  and data on th e toxicity and efficacy 
from MM trials are used for subsequent studies in amyloidosis.  
Bendamustine is a drug which is approved and has been widely used in therapy for MM, N HL, 
breast cancer and other malignancies  for 46 years . Based on several phase III t rials, 
bendamustine received FDA approval for CLL  (100 mg/m2) and NHL (120 mg/m2 d1 and d2)  in 
the US. Due to the extensive  experience and large amount of safety and toxicity data on 
bendamustine in hematologic malignancies, we think it is justified and sa fe to use bendamustine 
in a phase II trial  for patients with AL with a strict stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  
 
 
 
1.4 Correlative Studies:  
Cyclin D1 Overexpression in AL  
The correlative studies for this trial will be performed at Tufts University Medical Center, 
[LOCATION_011], MA in [CONTACT_863126]’s laboratory . This group is actively investigating the 
characterization of clonal plasma cells in AL. Recent data from this lab and others indicate that 
these cells over -express CCND1 in one-half of cases, often associated with t(11;14)  and or gain 
11q.21,22 In a report at the American Society of Hematology Meeting (ASH 2009), clonal plasma 
cells (CD138+) obtained at diagnosis from 58 patients with AL were evaluated for CCND1 
expression.23 Sixteen cases were assessed by [CONTACT_11072] U133 A 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix; Santa 
Clara, CA) and 42 cases by [CONTACT_23133]-time polymerase chain reaction  (qRT-PCR) as 
previously described.7,24 With transcriptional profiles (n=16), CCND1 median log e-transformed 
quantitative expression levels were 11.08 (range, 9.6 -11.55) in five versus 4.163 (3.875 -5.447) in 
eleven patients ( P < 0.01). With qRT -PCR (n=42), relative CCND1 expression levels were high 
in twenty [median of 4.21 (1.76 -17.24)], and low in twenty -two patients, [median of 0.014 (0 -
0.99)] (P < 0.0001). Overall, 43% (25/58) of pat ients were CCND1hi and did not differ from 
 CONFIDENTIAL  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
   
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_1203286] to organ involvement, troponin I, urine total protein, creatinine or 
alkaline phosphatase levels . The median brain natriuretic peptide  (BNP) of CCND1hi patients 
was 252pg/ml (range 20 -1880), significantly higher than that of CCND1lo patients (109pg/ml (5 -
4210), P < 0.05). CCND1hi patients tended to have more plasma cells (13% versus 8%, P = 
0.06), higher serum free light chain levels (23.3 versus 14mg/dl, P = 0.12) and more kappa 
clones (6/25 versus 2/33, P = 0.06) than CCND1lo patients. CCND1hi patients also had 
significantly fewer intact immunoglobulin M -proteins (4/25 versus 22/33, P <0.01). Although 
there were no differences in treatment modalities used in terms of SCT or MDex as we ll as in the 
rates of CHR, there was  a significant difference in OS (Figure 1). CCND1hi patients survived a 
median of only 27 months compared to 60 months for CCND1lo patients (P = 0.02), and had a 
risk of death of 2.86 (CI 1.18 -6.94). 
CCND1 over-expressin g clones then usually produce only immunoglobulin light chains and not 
intact immunoglobulins because of loss of Ig heavy chain gene loci due to t(11;14). Preliminary 
data from the Comenzo lab indicates that CCND1 over-expressing clones also over -express  
genes associated with maintenance of protein solubility and protein quality control such as 
PDIA6 and SEL1L, a phenomena possibly linked to the exclusive production of Ig light chains 
that form amyloid. The correlative studies of clonal bone marrow plasma cells selected from pre -
treatment marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_863084]1 over-expressing clones 
up-regulate SEL1L, a genes involved in ER -associated protein quality control. Using patient bone 
marrow specimens obtained at baseline, we  will perform RT-PCR to assess the expression in 
clonal plasma cells of the genes CCND1 and SEL1L and determine whether their expression is 
correlated.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected Adverse Events  
Common (occurs in more than 10% of people - more than 10 out of 100 people):  
 Blood abnormalities, such as a decrease in the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, 
platelet, and/or neutrophils. White blood cells are  cells of your immune system.  A decrease 
in white blood cells and or neutrophils may lead to fever and/or a life threatening infection.  
The red blood cells carry oxygen to your organs.  A decrease in red blood cells can lead to 
fatigue.  A decrease in pl atelets may lead to bleeding and require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056].   An 
elevated number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, may also be seen.  
 Infections ( such as pneumonia) requiring antibiotic treatment  
 Nausea 
 Vomiting  
 Diarrhea 
 Constipation  
 Dehydration  
 Fatigue 
 Hair loss 
 Fever 
 Allergic reactions  
 Chills 
 Pruritus (itchy skin)  
 Rash 
 Phlebitis 
 Hives 
 Hypersensitivity  
 Mouth sores and pain  
 Dry mouth  
 Cough 
 Weight loss/ lack of appetite  
 Potential risk of temporary discomfort, bleeding, hematoma and infection after  venipuncture  
 
Infrequent (occurs in 1% to 10% of people - from 1 to 10 out of 100 people):  
 Blood clots in your arteries which may cause stroke or heart attack or other problems. These 
conditions can be life -threatening or fatal.  
 
Rare (occurs in fewer tha n 1% of people – fewer than 1 out of 100 people):  
 Kidney damage  
 Reversible changes in liver function tests that may indicate liver damage  
 CONFIDENTIAL  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
   
Version: Amendment 10 Dated 03 March 2015   Page 26 of 57  Pulmonary edema (pulmonary edema is an abnormal build up of fluid in the lungs, which 
leads to swelling).  
 Myelodyspl astic syndrome, a pre -cancerous blood condition which could lead to leukemia  
 Toxic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_19342], which is a severe and frequently fatal skin reaction similar to a 
severe burn.  
 Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reaction (particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of 
therapy) 
 Infection associated with septic shock and death  
 Death 
 Extravasation: During the intravenous infusion of bendamustine, there have been reports of 
drug escapi[INVESTIGATOR_863090]. This can cause redness, sw elling, pain, 
infection and tissue damage.  
 Severe skin reactions (if relationship to Bendamustine is suspected, discontinue 
Bendamustine ) 
 Tumor lysis syndrome (tends to be within the first treatment cycle and without in tervention, 
may lead to acute renal f ailure and death)  
 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Tumor lysis syndrome associated with bendamustine treatment has been reported in patients in 
clinical trials and in spontaneous reports. The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of 
bendamustine and, wit hout intervention, may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive 
measures include maintaining adequate volume status, and close monitoring of serum chemistry, 
particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol has also been used prior to or a t the 
beginning of bendamustine therapy. However, there may be an increased risk of severe skin 
toxicity when bendamustine and allopurinol are administered concomitantly.  
 
Skin Reactions  
Skin reactions have been reported in clinical trials and postmarketin g spontaneous reports. These 
events have included rash, toxic skin reactions, and bullous exanthema. Some events occurred 
when bendamustine was given in combination with other anticancer agents, so the precise 
relationship of the skin reactions to bendamus tine treatment is uncertain.  
 In a study of bendamustine (90 mg/m2) in combination with rituximab (study SDX -105-02), [ADDRESS_1203299] been r eported when bendamustine was administered 
concomitantly with allopurinol and other medications known to cause these syndromes. The 
relationship to bendamustine cannot be determined.  
When skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in sever ity with further 
treatment. Therefore, patients with skin reactions should be monitored closely. If skin reactions 
are severe or progressive, bendamustine treatment should be withheld or discontinued.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Route of Administ ration 
Oral: 40 mg orally will be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 22  of each cycle . 
Individual patients will stay at the same dose level throughout study treatment unless they 
require dose reduction due to DLT.  
Intravenous: Dexamethasone can be administered  intravenously at the same dose level at any 
point in the study cycle if this is more convenient for the study subject and/or the study site.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks of Dexamethasone  
The most common side effects of dexamethasone include infection, insomnia, seizures, muscl e 
weakness, particularly the thigh muscles, irritability and mood swings, weight gain, increased 
appetite, diabetes mellitus (high blood sugar), high blood pressure, thromboembolism, peptic 
ulcers, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), mucositis  and fluid retention.  
 
Intravenous administration of d examethasone may cause  following side effects:  
 Temporary discomfort from the needle stick  
 Bruising  
 Bleeding 
 Infection (rare )  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1203300]’s research record.  
 
All patients will receive prophylaxis with either an H -2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor while 
on study medications. Prophylactic antibioti cs (Bactrim, Diflucan) should be considered. All 
supportive care should be given according to institutional standards.  
 
Use of insulin and/or oral hypoglycemics to control hyperglycemia related to dexamethasone 
therapy is allowed per physician discretion.  
 
6.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Myelosuppression : Growth factors, specifically filgrastim (granulocyte colony stimulating factor; 
G-CSF) or pegfilgrastim only (GM -CSF not allowed), can be used to treat neutropenia . The 
usual dose of filgrastim is 5 micrograms/kg/day given subcutaneously until the ANC is greater 
than 1,[ADDRESS_1203301] chemotherapy . The major adverse even with filgrastim and pegfilgrastim is 
bone pain. Other side effects are rare and in clude nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, 
constipation, fever, anorexia, headache, taste perversion, dyspepsia, myalgia, insomnia, 
 CONFIDENTIAL  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
   
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_1203302] also been 
observed.  
 
Hyperglycemia : Hyperglycemia, sometimes severe, including diabetic coma or ketoacidosis can 
occur with dexamethasone therapy. Therefore blood sugars should be monitored in diabetic 
patients, borderline patients, and in patients at risk for hyperglycemia or diabetes.  
 
Anemia: Patients with hemoglobin <  8 mg/dL and/or symptomatic receive packed red blood cells  
transfusion . The final decision should be made at the discretion of the investigator or an 
authorized physician sub -investigator.  
Subjects are allowed to be treated with full dose anti -coagulation (full dose low molecular weight 
heparin or warfarin with a goal INR of 2 to 3) while on study, however the toxicity management 
guidelines as outlined below must  be followed . 
 
6.4 Dosing Delays/Modifications  
Treatment modifications are based on adverse events, which are possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to drug. All AEs should be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE, v. 4.0).   Due to the complex problems that may occur in this patient 
population, it is at the discretion of the investigator to decrease the dose level of the study drugs 
if medically indicated.  The investigator should inform the lea d institution’s principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_863091].   Dose modifications and delays different from those stated in 
the protocol, for management of toxicities, will be permitted at the discretion of the Investigator.  
6.4.1 Bendamustine Adjustme nts for Hematologic Toxicities  
The following treatment adjustments for hematologic toxicities are recommended. The 
investigator or an authorized physician sub -investigator may modify the recommendations if the 
clinical situation dictates a change.  
 
▪ Uncomplicated Neutropenia : On Day 1 of each cycle, if Gr ade 3 or 4 neutropenia is the only 
Grade 3 or 4 adverse event present , hold all study drugs, monitor CBC weekly . If neutropenia 
resolves to grade 1 or baseline within 7 days resume treatment at prev ious dose level and add G -
CSF or Peg-G-CSF at Day 3 of cycle .  
If neutropenia does not resolve to baseline or grade 1 within 7 days, start daily G -CSF without 
initiating next cycle of therapy . If neutropenia resolves with G -CSF at  7days of starting G -
CSF, start next cycle without dose reduction and adding G -CSF with the next cycle. If 
neutropenia does not resolve with G -CSF at  7 days of adding G -CSF, patient is off study.   
Patients who experience a Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia on Day 1 and received pegfilgr astim in the 
previous cycle should be dose -reduced for the following cycle.  
 
At any other time  of each cycle (with protocol labs), if grade 3 or 4 neutropenia is the only grade 
3 or 4 adverse event, add G -CSF. Do not reduce dose for next cycle . Add G-CSF on Day 3 of 
next cycle. If patient is already receiving G -CSF, then dose is reduced by [CONTACT_863112].  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
   
Version: Amendment 10 Dated 03 March 2015   Page 29 of 57 ▪ Complex/Complicated Neutropenia : Sustained (≥ to 7 days) Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia subsequent 
to G-CSF or associated with fever/infection (temperature ≥ 38.5°C AND requiring antibiotic 
treatment) hold study drugs and follow CBC weekly . When toxicity resol ves to baseline or  
Grade 1, start new cycle at next lower dose level  with G-CSF. 
 
Adherence to the preceding guidelines regarding G -CSF use with neutropenia is strongly 
encouraged; however final decision regarding use of G -CSF rests with the study site i nvestigator  
and his/her clinical judgment.  
 
▪ Thrombocytopenia:   Grade 3/4 (Plt < 50,000/mm3) hold all study drugs, follow CBC  and dose 
reduce to next lower dose level. If grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurs for more than 7 days and/or 
is associated with significant bleeding (e.g., requiring transfusion ) patient is off study regardless 
of the dose level.  When toxicity resolves to baseline or  Grade 1, start new cycle at next lower 
dose level.  
▪ Lymphopenia:  Grade 3/4 is expected and will not be graded as an AE.  
▪ Anemia: Grade 4, patient should be evalu ated for other reasons of anemia such as hemolytic 
anemia, bleeding, etc.  
 
All patients should get optimal supportive therapy such as platelet or red blood cell transfusion.  
6.4.2 Bendamustine Adjustments for Other Toxicities  
There are no reductions in th e bendamustine dose if bendamustine is given at dose level -2. If 
adverse events occur at dose level -2 that require holding bendamustine, the dose will remain the 
same once treatment resumes. If bendamustine is held for more than 4 weeks, the study site 
investigator should consult with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_863092]. If an AE occurs at a higher dose, the 
bendamustine dose will be reduced according to the table  in section 6.7 . 
 
6.4.3 Dexamethasone Treatment Adjustments  
It is expected given the low dose of dexamethasone that few dose modifications related to 
dexamethasone will be necessary.  Refer to the dose modifications table, Section 6.7,  for the dose 
reduction levels for dexamethasone.

7.1 Definition of Hematologic Response   
The clonal protein may be in the form of an M spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (SPEP/UPEP)  or monoclonal 
protein (immunoelectrophoresis) or elevated free light chain levels with an abnormal 
ratio. Some patients have all [ADDRESS_1203312] . Therefore, 
evaluation of the clonal plasma cell  disease can be based on serum protein 
electrophoresis (SPEP, M spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]), immunoelectrophoresis (quantitative immunoglobulins, 
monoclonal or M protein), or serum free light chain assay, and on bone marrow biopsy 
stained for isotypic plasma cells .  Neverthele ss free light chain s are the most relevant 
prognostic marker and should be followed as the preferred response criteria.  It is 
expected that around 15% of the patients have normal FLC or dFLC < 4 g/dL at baseline. 
For those patients standard criteria of mul tiple myeloma response evaluation using SPEP 
and UPEP should be applied.  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
   
Version: Amendment 10 Dated 03 March 2015   Page 36 of 57  Complete Response (CR):  Normalization of the free light chain levels and ratio, 
negative serum and urine immunofixation.  
 Very Good Partial Response (VGPR):  Reduction in t he differenc e between involved 
and uninvolved free light chains (dFLC) to <4 mg/dL. 
 A  90% reduction of the M protein with persistence by [CONTACT_863115] a VGPR.  
 Partial Response (PR):  Reduction of t he difference between involved and uninvolved 
free light chains (dFLC) of ≥ 50%. 
 A reduction of  50% of the M -protein if M -spi[INVESTIGATOR_179409]  0.5 g/dL will be considered a PR.  
 No Response (NR):  Less than a PR.  
 Progression of Disease  (PD): 
•From CR: any detectable monoclonal protein or abnormal free light chain r atio 
(light chain ratio must double)  
•From PR, 50% increase in serum M protein to >0.5 g/dL or 50% increase in 
urine M protein to >200mg/day (a visible peak must be present)  
•Free light chain increase of 50% to >100 mg/L  
 
 Bone marrow biopsy comparisons are  part of the response assessment in order to confirm 
CHR or in case of not measurable m -spi[INVESTIGATOR_863096] . It is for this reason that marrow 
biopsies are stained at baseline for CD138 (plasma cell marker) and isotypic light chains 
(kappa and lambda, by [CONTACT_863116]). This 
approach allows estimation of total plasma cells (CD138+) and relative kappa -to-lambda 
ratio based on isotypic staining. A normal marrow biopsy has less than 2% plasma cells in 
a diffuse distribution.  The normal kappa -to-lambda ratio ranges from 4:1 to 1:1; estimates 
of the ratio outside of that range are considered indicative of clonal plasma cell disease.  
 A CHR to therapy requires undetectability of the prior M spi[INVESTIGATOR_423830]/or monoclonal 
protein and/or abnormal serum free light chain by [CONTACT_863117], and no evidence of 
the prior clonal plasma cell disease by [CONTACT_36087] (normal marrow biopsy  5% 
plasma cells).

1. Primary Objective:  Determine the partial hematologic response (PHR) Only patients who 
have receiv ed at least [ADDRESS_1203315] -treatment will be estimated, with a 95% 
exact binomial confidence interval.  
2. Secondary Objective 1: Determine overall hematologic resp onse (OHR) rate  The proportion 
of response-evaluable patients experiencing OHR will be estimated, with a 95% exact 
binomial confidence interval.  
3. Secondary Objective 2: Determine the organ response rate (OrRR) The proportion of 
response-evaluable patients e xperiencing OrRR will be estimated, with a 95% exact binomial 
confidence interval.  
4. Secondary Objective 3:  Determine the distribution of time to failure (TTF).  Time to failure 
will be assessed for each patient from day of first treatment, where failure wil l be defined as 
disease progression or death.  The survival function of TTF for response -evaluable patients 
will be estimated using the product -limit (Kaplan -Meier) estimator, along with 95% 
confidence bounds . The median time to failure will be estimated f rom the survival function.   
The analysis will be repeated on all patients who receive any therapy.  
5. Secondary Objective 4: Assess the toxicity of the regimen  Toxicities (adverse events at least 
possibly related to treatment) will be tabulated for patients w ho receive any therapy by [CONTACT_863118].  
6. Secondary Objective 5:  Determine the distribution of overall survival (OS)   Survival is 
assessed as time to death from first day of treatment The OS function for response -evaluable 
will be estimated using the product -limit (Kaplan -Meier) estimator, along with 95% 
confidence bounds . The median survival will be estimated from the survival function.  The 
analysis will be repeated on all patients who receive any therapy.  
7. Secondary Objective 6:  Assess by [CONTACT_937]-PCR the effects on expression in clonal plasma cells 
of genes associated with ER stress (GADD153, BiP) and cell -cycle regulation (CCND1, p16, 
p21). Change from baseline in these endpoints will be characterized graphically (e.g., by 
[CONTACT_863119]) and by [CONTACT_863120] (e.g., mean, standard deviation, median) . The null 
hypothesis of no change over time will be tested by a signed -rank test, or, if appropriate, 
single-sample t-test. 
 
9 CORRELATIVE LABORATORY STUDIES  
The laboratory of one of the co -investigators ([CONTACT_863126], Tufts Medical Center) 
will be performing correlative studies on the marrow plasma cells of consenting patients 
obtained before the first cycle  of bendamustine and dexamethasone. Five (5) mL of bone marrow

patients.21,[ADDRESS_1203318] 
immunoglobulins because of loss of Ig heavy chain gene loci due to t(11;14). Preliminary data 
from the Comenzo la b indicates that CCND1 over-expressing clones also over -express gene s 
associated with maintenance of protein solubility and protein quality control ( PDIA6, Sel1L), a 
phenomena possibly linked to the exclusive production of Ig light chains that form amyloid . The 
correlative studies of clonal bone marrow plasma cells selected from pre -treatment marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_863084]1 over-expressing clones up -regulate the se 
genes involved in ER -associated protein quality control. Using pa tient bone marrow specimens 
obtained at baseline, we will perform RT-PCR to assess the expression in clonal plasma cells of 
the genes CCND1 and Sel1L. 
 
Quantitative RT-PCR will be performed (in triplicate and on 2 separate days) using TaqMAN 
Gene Expressio n Assays with RPLP0 (Hs99999902_m1) primers and probes (Applied 
Biosystems; Foster City, CA) as internal control on an Mx 3000P platform and related software 
(Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). The comparative Ct method will be used and the amount of target 
normalized to the control (2-ΔΔCt) assuming an efficiency of 2. Statistical analyses (paired t -test) 
will be performed with GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad; La Jolla, CA) with P < 0.[ADDRESS_1203319] to expression levels of PDIA6 and SEL1A. These studies may lead to new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863099] . 
 
The correlative studies are optional.  
 
10 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
10.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
 Adverse event : Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study; regardless of the 
causal relationship of the event with the investigational drug or study treatment(s).  
 Associated with the use of the investigational drug or study treatment(s) : There is a reasonable 
possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_863121](s).  
 Disability: A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
 Life-threatening adverse event : Any adverse event that plac es the patient or subject, in the 
view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (i.e., 
does not include an adverse event that, had it actually occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death).  
 Serious adverse ev ent: Any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863100]  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
   
Version: Amendment 10 Dated 03 March 2015   Page 40 of 57 prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355817] (even if less than 24 hours) to a 
healthcare facility as a result of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244]; to include 
transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863101]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863102] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical adverse event (e.g., for a 
preexisting condition not associated with a new adverse event or with a worsening of 
the preexisting condition; admission for  a protocol -specified procedure) is not, in 
itself, a serious adverse event.  
 Unexpected adverse event : Any adverse event, the frequency, specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the risk information described in the clinical protocol(s) . 
 
10.2 Recording/Reporting Requirements  
10.2.1 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
 
Clinical study subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse events at study visits.  
 
10.2.2 Recording Requirements  
All observed or volunteered adverse drug events (serious or  non-serious) and abnormal test 
findings, regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational 
drug or study treatment(s) will be recorded in the subjects’ case histories . For all adverse events, 
sufficient information will  be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate 
determination of the outcome of the event (i.e., whether the event should be classified as a 
serious adverse event) and; 2) an assessment of the casual relationship between the adverse event 
and the investigational drug or study treatment(s) . 
 
Adverse events or abnormal test findings felt to be associated with the investigational drug or 
study treatment(s) will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding 
resolves or st abilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.  
 
Abnormal Test Findings  
An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following 
criteria are met:  
▪ The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659].  
▪ The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical 
intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or  other therapy.  
Note: simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed crite ria, does not 
constitute an adverse even t. 
▪ The test finding leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation of subject participation in 
the clinical study . 
▪ The test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_093] -sponsor.

follow-up SAE report should include a re -evaluation of the original determination of grade and 
relationship of the event, along with all results supporting this assessment.  
 
The Coordinating Site will maintain documentation of all participating s ites’ Adverse Event 
information and be responsible for communicating to all participating site investigators and 
notifying the funding a gency or sponsor , as necessary.  Participating site investigators will 
review any distributed AE reports, send a copy to  their IRB according to their local IRB’s 
policies and procedures, and file a copy with their regulatory documents.  
 
Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IRB  
In accordance with applicable policies of the Columbia University’s  Institutional Review Bo ard 
(IRB), the investigator -sponsor will report, to the IRB, any observed or volunteered adverse 
event that is determined to be 1) at least possibly related to participation  2) increases risk ; and 3) 
unexpected . Adverse event reports will be submitted to t he IRB in accordance with  the 
respective IRB procedures.  
 
Applicable adverse events will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible and, in no event, later 
than 5 calendar days following the investigator -sponsor’s receipt of the respective information . 
Adverse events which are 1) associated with the investigational drug or study treatment(s); 2) 
fatal or life -threatening; and 3) unexpected will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of the 
investigator -sponsor’s receipt of the respective information.  
 
Follow-up information to reported adverse event will be submitted to the IRB as soon as the 
relevant information is available . If the results of the sponsor -investigator’s follow -up 
investigation show that an adverse event that was initially determined to not require reporting to 
the IRB does, in fact, meet the requirements for reporting; the investigator -sponsor will report 
the adverse event to the IRB as soon as possible, but in no event later than 5 calendar days, after 
the determination was made.

FAILURE28 
 
The [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification provides a simple way of  
classifying heart disease (originally cardiac failure), useful for preoperative assessment. It places 
patients in one of four categories, based on how much they are limited during physical activity:  
Class I: patients with no limitation of activities; they s uffer no symptoms from ordinary 
activities.  
Class II: patients with slight, mild limitation of activity; they are comfortable with rest or 
with mild  exertion. 
Class III: patients with marked limitation of activity; they are comfortable only at rest.  
Class IV: patients who should be at complete rest, confined to bed or chair; any physical 
activity brings  on discomfort and symptoms occur at rest.

Version: Amendment 10 Dated 03 March 2015   Page 56 of 57 APPENDIX D . CREATININE CLEARANC E FORMULA  
 
Creatinine clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockcroft -Gault equation as follows:  
CrCl (ml/min) = (140 -age) (actual wt in kg)  
72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl)  
 
For females use 85% of calculated CrCl value.  
Note: In markedly obese patients, the Cockroft -Gault formula will tend to overestimate the 
creatinine  clearance. (Adipose tissue tends to contribute little creatinine requiring renal 
clearance.)

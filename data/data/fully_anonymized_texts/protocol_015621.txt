1.0 Background  According to the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 
approximately [ADDRESS_938273] ome, which in 
turn increases the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Diabetes has also been associated with a dramatically increased risk of hear t attack, stroke, and renal failure.
[ADDRESS_938274] diabetes. In these individuals, the prevalence of 
hypertension is 1.5 to 3 times greater than in sex-aged-matched controls.7,8  
    Given the additive cardiovascular risk of di abetes and hypertension, blood pressure goals in 
diabetic subjects are ≤ 130/80 mm Hg, as defined by [CONTACT_691836] (ADA) 
9 
and the Seventh Joint National Committee fo r the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of High Bloo d Pressure (JNC 7).10 The evidence that support s the lower blood pressure 
goals in diabetic patients comes from large controlled studies, su ch as The [LOCATION_008] 
Prospective Diabetes Study ([LOCATION_006]PDS), which demons trated a 45% reduction in relative risk of 
fatal and non-fatal stroke with tight BP contro l, with a BP 10/5 mm Hg lower than the group 
randomized to less controlled.11 Similarly, the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study showed a 
50% reduction in cardiovascular disease in th e group randomized to ac hieve a diastolic blood 
pressure below [ADDRESS_938275] proven to be effective, however only few 
patients are able to achieve blood pressu re control with those interventions.13 The JNC 7 guidelines 
recommend starting both an tihypertensive medication and lifestyl e modifications in patients with 
diabetes when hypertension is diagnosed.10 Among the antihypertensive drugs available, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  are the first-line ther apy in patients with 
hypertension and diabetes, according to guideli nes from the ADA, the NKF, the World Health 
Organization, and the JNC 7. 9,10,14,15 
 
To reduce the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascul ar disease and renal failure in patients with 
both diabetes and hypertension, it is also important to achieve  a good glycemic control. Among 
the anti-diabetic agents, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (D PP-4) inhibitors are novel anti-diabetic agents. 
These drugs inhibit the DPP-[ADDRESS_938276] DPP-4 inhibitor 
approved by [CONTACT_691837]. Since its appr oval in 2006 this drug has become one of the 
leading branded oral anti-diabetic  agents in the [LOCATION_002].17 DPP-4 inhibitors offer advantages 
over commonly used anti-diabetic agents, such as a glucose-dependent mechanism of action and 
lack of weight gain.18,19,20 However, there is information that remains to be known regarding 
safety, efficacy and drug inter actions of DPP-4 inhibitors.

2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  Hypertension and diabetes are important modifiable morbidity and mortality risk factors. The 
prevalence of hypertension is nearly 1 billion worldwide.
21 On the other hand; approximately [ADDRESS_938277] line therapy in patients with 
diabetes and hypertension are angiotensin conver ting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors because of its 
renoprotective and antithrombotic properties. Desp ite the wide variety of  anti-diabetic drugs 
available, it remains difficult to achieve adequa te glycemic control. DPP-4 inhibitors are a 
promising new anti-diabetic drug class. By [CONTACT_161218]-4 enzyme, they 
prevent the degradation of incret ins GLP-1 and GIP, which increase the release of insulin, suppress 
glucagon release, and delay gastric emptying.16  
 
Notably, DPP-4 enzyme intervenes in the degrada tion of several vasoactive peptides such as 
brain natriuretic peptid e (BNP), Neuropeptide Y (1-36), Pe ptide YY (1-36), and substance P 
(SP).23 The ubiquitous nature of this enzyme would translate into diverse hemodynamic effects, 
and could potentially result in diverse drug inter actions, as it was ascertained by [CONTACT_161219]. 
They found that the DPP-4 inhibito r, P32/98, significantly increased blood pressure in pre-treated 
(captopril 30 mg/kg or hydralazine 5mg/kg) adult spontaneous hyper tensive rats (SHR).[ADDRESS_938278] induced by [CONTACT_161220]-4 inhibitor 
in that study was attributed to neuropeptide Y; ne vertheless a hypertensive effect mediated through 
other vasoactive peptides, such as su bstance P could not be ruled out.  
 
Substance P on the other hand, is primarily in activated by [CONTACT_161221]-converting enzyme 
(ACE); under ACE inhibition however, DPP-[ADDRESS_938279] previously assessed th e hemodynamic effects of the c oncomitant inhibition of the 
DPP-4 enzyme and the ACE in subjects with meta bolic syndrome. The main finding of the study 
was that sitagliptin prevented the decrease in me an arterial blood pressu re (MAP) when ACE was 
fully inhibited by [CONTACT_161222], but  not during sub-maximal ACE i nhibition. Furtherm ore, the HR 
significantly increased in response to [ADDRESS_938280] ed an increased sympathetic 
outflow.
29 We hypothesize that thes e effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and sympat hetic activity 
could be due to an unrestrained am ount of substance P, secondary to th e inhibition of the two main 
enzymes involved in its degradation.29

 Specific Aim:  To test the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibiti on attenuates the anti- hypertensive effect 
of chronic ACE inhibition, but not AT1 receptor i nhibition, in T2DM through a substance P (NK1) 
receptor-dependent mechanism

(NK

solitarious (NTS) and its e ffect in the modulation of  cardiovascular function.37,38,39,[ADDRESS_938283] imulation of the dorsal periaqueductal grey matter in anesthetized 
rats. The bilateral microinjection of SP in NTS pr oduced an immediate and brief (6-7 min) increase 
in MBP (+25±2 mm Hg from a baseline of 84±1 mm Hg, P<0.05) and a concomitant decrease in 
HR (-45±7 bpm from a baseline  of 334±5 bpm, P<0.05). Moreover, bilateral microin jections of 
SP into the NTS produced a dose-dependent inhib ition of phenylephrine evoked-cardiac response 
and aortic cardiac response whic h was reversed by [CONTACT_161225]1 receptors antagonist, 
GR205171.
[ADDRESS_938284].
41 SP increased MAP and HR +31.4±2.5 mm Hg and +190±13.[ADDRESS_938285], muscinol.41 Similarly, the microinjection of substance P in the 
nucleus of the amigdala centralis also elicits pr essor responses, whereas pre-injection with [D-
Pro2, D-Phe7, D-Trp9]-SP, a substance P antagonist, in th e same area attenuated the pressor 
response to glutamate.42  
 The mechanism underlying the pressor actions a nd heart rate response s are attributed to 
sympato-adrenal stimulations, as demonstrated  by [CONTACT_691838].
30,31,32 Unger et al reported increased BP, HR, and sympathetic nerve activity (splenic, 
renal, and adrenal nerves) in c onscious rats. They found that the acute administration of 1 µg of 
substance P increased the sympat hetic nerve activ ity by + 85%, + 147%, a nd + 63%, respectively 
(P < 0.001).32 In a similar fashion, Dzurik et al demonstrated that substance P increases

 sympathetic outflow in humans, as evidenced by a decrease muscle sympathetic nerve activity 
(MSNA) with the administration of the NK-[ADDRESS_938286] of enalapril (10 mg) in patients with me tabolic syndrome. Mean arterial blood pressure 
changes were -7.9±2.4 mm Hg with placebo plus  enalapril, whereas MAP was -0.9±0.9±2.[ADDRESS_938287] was only evidenced with 10 mg of 
enalapril, but not with 5 mg. Mo reover, the HR significantly incr eased in response to 10 mg 
enalapril plus sitagliptin. This was also associated  with increased in plasma catecholamine levels, 
which suggests an increased sympathetic outflow.
29 We proposed that the effects on blood 
pressure, heart rate, and sympathetic activity coul d be due to an unrestrai ned amount of substance 
P, secondary to the inhibition of the two main enzymes involved in its degradation.29

  This study will be double–blinded. Neither the investigator nor the patient will be aware of the 
treatment assignment or the order of randomization. 
   6.0 Endpoints  The primary analyses will focus on:  MAP, SBP, DBP, heart rate, and NE concentrat ions during ramipril versus ramipril+sitagliptin 
MAP, SBP, DBP, heart rate, and NE concen trations during ramipril+sitagliptin versus 
ramipril+sitagliptin+apreptitant.  
We will make similar comparisons within the valsartan- and placebo-treated groups. In 
addition, we will compare MAP, SBP, DBP, h eart rate, and endocrine parameters among the 
ramipril-treated, valsartan-treate d, and amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-treated groups  during comparable concurrent 
treatment. Secondary endpoints of the study will include: 
 
Hemodynamic and renal measurements : urinary sodium, potassium, and catecholamine excretion 
Vasoactive biomarkers : substance P, substance P metabolite s, neuropeptide Y, DPP-4 activity, 
ACE activity, plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II, aldosterone, plasma catecholamine levels  Glucose homeostasis biomarkers : plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and glycerol   
  7.0 Study Procedures 
 Screening Visit 1:  After informed consent is obtained, subjects will undergo a medical history 
and physical examination. During this and all vis its to the CRC we will measure blood pressure 
three times, every two mi nutes as described under Standard Techniques . We will measure 
weight, height, and hips and waist (horizontal umbilicus) circ umference to 0.5 cm precision in 
triplicate. We will use a spring-loaded tape measure (Gulick II by [CONTACT_161232], Gay 
Mills,WI) for these measurements to ensure the tightness of the ta pe is consistent. We will obtain 
screening laboratory tests including:  electrolytes, serum creatinine, fasting glucose level, complete 
blood count, liver enzymes, lipid pr ofile, hemoglobin A1C, and urinal ysis. Data will be transferred 
using the REDCap Dynamic Data Pull (DDP) to en able transfer of rele vant study related data 
directly from the Vanderbil t Research Derivative. 
 Screening Visit 2: subjects whose screening labs are adequate will return to the CRC to undergo 
an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).  Medication withdrawal:  Hypertensive subjects will have appropriate anti-hypertensive 
medications  (those of which have the potential to affect measurements of interest during the study) 
discontinued three weeks prior to  the initiation of the study,  Figure 1
. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_691824].  Hydroc hlorothiazide may be continued 
throughout the study at a ma ximum dose of 25mg daily.  If appropriate, medicati ons will be tapered. 
During this period, subjects will be asked to mon itor their blood pressure every 1-3 days for the 
 
02/19/[ADDRESS_938296] the res earch nurse and/or investig ator if at any time their 
seated systolic pressure is >170 mmHg or their seated diastolic pressure is >[ADDRESS_938297] a member of the study team if their glucose level 
is ≤70mg/dL or ≥300mg/dL. Should this occur and the su bject have sustained hyperglycemia 
>300mg/dL or significant hypoglyce mia at any time, the subject will be discon tinued from the 
study and his/her regular medi cations will be restarted. 
 Medication Visit: Subjects will be asked to come to th e CRC at least [ADDRESS_938298] will received the pre-treatment and 
intervention drug by [CONTACT_78141] a small amount of water (t=0).  Blood samples for vasoactive 
biomarkers will be drawn at baseline and ever y hour thereafter for 4 hours. We will draw blood 
for measurement of glucose, insulin, DPP4 and ACE activity, plasma renin activity (PRA), Ang 
II, and aldosterone at baseline and 3 hours.  We will measure substance P, NPY, and 
catecholamines [NE, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and the in traneuronal metabolite dihydroxyphenyl glycol 
(DHPG)] prior to medication admin istration, every hour thereafter and after [ADDRESS_938299] will b
 e 
asked to stand up and rema in in an upright positi on for 30 minutes (orthost atic challenge). BP and 
 
02/19/2019  
12 
 HR will be recorded every 5 minutes throughout the 30-minute orthostatic challenge. At the end 
of the orthostatic challenge, we will take blood samples to measure vasoac tive biomarkers (while 
in upright position, during maxi mal sympathetic activation).  
 
Following completion of study days [ADDRESS_938300] a 4-week washout period while  continuing taking the pre-treatment drug 
(amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], ramipril, or valsartan). Telephone or  email follow-up will occur 1 and 7 days after 
each study day.  DNA samples:  A blood sample for DNA analys is will be drawn once duri ng the study and will be 
stored for analysis of genetic markers related to subject’s susceptibility to the development of 
hypertension, cardiovascular diseas e, metabolic alterations, and/or  response to treatment. This 
sample is not required for participation in the st udy. Genetic information w ill be linked with data 
collected during the conduct of this trial. As th e relationships between genes and diseases become 
less equivocal, it might be  possible to predict an individual’s  susceptibility to a disease, its 
prognosis, and the response to treatment. Blood specimens will be coded. Codes will not include any identification information; such as name, date  of birth, or medical re cord number. Only study 
key personnel will have access to those codes. The iden tity of each code will be kept in a file in an 
encrypted computer.    8.0 Risks of Investigational Agents/Devices (side effects) 
 
Risks/Inconvenience 
 
 Insertion of venous catheters may cause  bleeding, bruising, or infection. 
 Frequent blood draws can cause anemia. 
 Collecting urine in a jug for 24 hours can be inconvenient for subjects. 
 Spending study days at the CRC can be inconvenient for subjects. 
 There is a risk of high blood pressure duri ng the 3-week washout (of anti-hypertensive 
treatment) phase of the study. 
 It has been reported that vild agliptin, a DPP-[ADDRESS_938301] 
4 weeks. The half-life of sita gliptin is 12 hours, therefore it is unlikely that subjects 
develop angioedema. 
 Sitagliptin can cause hypoglycemia, peripheral edema, or nausea. In addition, sitagliptin 
can rarely increase the risk of  pancreatitis; however, this is  not likely to occur given the 
short duration of the study and the exclusion of subjects w ith past medical history of 
pancreatitis.  
 The FDA is warning that dipeptidyl peptidas e-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors such as sitagliptin, 
saxagliptin, linagliptin, and al ogliptin may cause joint pain that can be severe and 
 
02/19/2019

 disabling. After the patients di scontinued the DPP-4 inhibito r medicine, their symptoms 
were relieved, usually in less than a month. Some patients developed severe joint pain 
again when they restarte d the same medicine or another DPP-4 inhibitor. 
 Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_691825], fatigue, nausea, constipation, hypotension, bradycardia, 
dizziness, dehydration, diarrhea, dyspeps ia, or impaired liver function.  
 Ramipril or valsartan theoreti cally increases the risk of  hypotension; although, generally 
those drugs do not lower blood pressure signif icantly in individuals with normal blood 
pressure. In rare cases, ramipril or valsarta n may cause hyperkalemia. However, this is 
not expected in subjects with normal renal function. 
 
 Protection against risk  
 The research nurse or physician will be present at all times during the study days.  
 Subjects with a hematocrit less than  35% will be excluded from the study.  
 In hypertensive subjects who are withdraw n from anti-hypertensive medications, blood 
pressure will be measured every [ADDRESS_938302] week and we ekly thereafter. If at 
any time the seated systolic pressure is > 170 mmHg or the seated diastolic pressure is 
>[ADDRESS_938303] will 
be withdrawn from the study and his/her anti -hypertensive medicati ons will be resumed. 
 Subjects will monitor their blood glucose once every 1-[ADDRESS_938304] 
weekly thereafter and notify the study personnel if their glucose levels are ≤ 70 or ≥300 
mg/dL and symptomatic or sustained, he/she will then be discon tinued from the study and 
restarted on his/her regular medications. 
 Potassium levels will be meas ured during each study day to  insure the subject is not 
hyperkalemic. 
  Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
If at any time during the study the seated systolic  pressure is >170 mmHg or  the seated diastolic 
pressure is >[ADDRESS_938305] develops symptoms of high blood pressure, he/she will be 
withdrawn from the study and his or her anti-hypertensive medications will be restarted. If in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] a su bject is non-compliant, the subj ect will be withdrawn from the 
study. Subjects who are withdrawn will be followe d until blood pressure has returned to normal 
and/or symptoms has resolved. 
 Similarly, if at any time the study subject  has sustained hyperglycemia >300mg/dL or 
significant hypoglycemia <70mg/dL, the subject will be withdrawn from the study. The subject 
will be followed until he/ she resumes his/ her prior diabetes medication(s). 
  
9.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipate d Problems involving Risk to Participants 
or Others 
 
 
02/19/[ADDRESS_938306] medical event will be classified 
as an adverse event, regardless of its causal relationship with the study. An adverse event it is 
considered to be serious if it results in: deat h, life-threatening condi tion, requires inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity, or results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Serious adverse events 
will be reported to the Data and Safety Mon itoring Committee (DSMC) and the IRB as soon as 
practicable following the event. Non-serious adverse events will be reported at the time of continuing review.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_691826]. The report will 
include: the number of adverse events and an explanation of how each event was handled, the 
number of complaints and how each complaint wa s handled, the number of subject withdrawals 
with an explanation of why the subject withdrew  or was withdrawn, and the number of instances 
of noncompliance with the protoc ol with explanation. Before s ubmission, the report will be 
reviewed internally by [CONTACT_978].  
 The DSMC will provide objective re view of treatment results as they relate to human safety. 
The committee will be comprised of Marie Griffi n, MD, Professor of H ealth Policy; Alvin C. 
Powers, MD, Director of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center, Professor of Medicine and Joe C. Davis Professor of Biomedical Science;  and [CONTACT_691849] N. Abumrad, John L.  Sawyers Professor of Surgery 
and Chairman, Vanderbilt Department of Surger y. [CONTACT_31134] will chair the committee.  
 The DSMC will meet at least [ADDRESS_938307] of non-serious adverse events. Interim data will be provided to the committee by [CONTACT_6283]. Brow n and Yu. The DSMC may 
choose to become unblinded; howev er, it is expected that such unblinding would not occur without 
reasonable concern related to either patient safety or data validity.

the same subjects during treatment  with ramipril+placebo versus ramipril+sitagliptin and between 
ramipril+sitagliptin versus ramip ril+sitagliptin+aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]. In our  prior study of the effect of 
sitagliptin on the hypotensive res ponse to 10 mg enalap ril, sitagliptin incr eased MAP following 
enalapril ~7 mmHg to 95±11.[ADDRESS_938309], a sample size of 45 would provide 
80% power to detect a 5-mmHg di fference in MAP between ramipril  and ramipril+sitagliptin or

power to detect a 6- and 7- mmHg difference, respectively. 
 Data Analysis Plan 
 
We will use standard graphing and screening te chniques to detect outliers and to ensure 
data accuracy. We will assess continuous outcomes fo r normality. If normality is violated, we will 
apply data transformation or consider non-parametric analysis  methods. We will provide summary 
statistics for both numerical and categorical va riables by [CONTACT_30157]. We will assess comparability 
among randomization groups. We wi ll conduct these basic data an alysis in all three Aims. 
  We are using an orthogonal La tin square design to conduct  a 3x3 crossover study within 
each of three parallel treatment  arms. Although we have designed the study to avoid a carryover 
effect, we will use general linear models (GLM) to  evaluate for the possi bility of carryover or 
period effect as detailed in Chapter 5 (pages 212-213) of Jones and Kenward.
[ADDRESS_938311] and with treatment factor 1 (amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], ramipril, 
valsartan) and treatment factor 2 (placebo, sitagliptin, sitagliptin+a prepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) as fixed effects. We 
will use an autoregressive model of order 1 [AR( 1)] or other plausible covariance structures for 
the error covariance. We will utilize mixed-effects m odels to evaluate treatment factor 2 (placebo, 
sitagliptin, sitagliptin+aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) within each  treatment group. We will conduct additional sub-
analyses such as GLM to compare the effect of treatment factor 1 (ramipril, valsartan, and 
amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) using data collected during the placebo or sitagliptin period of treatment factor 2. Both GLM and mixed-effects models provide the flexib ility of controlling for and of evaluating 
covariates, including gender, race, blood pressu re, and prior ACE inhibitor or ARB use.  
  In addition to performing regression analyses, we will estimate direct treatment differences 
as within-subject mean differenc e and 95% confidence intervals.  We will then compare within-
subject differences (such as ΔMAPsitagliptin-placebo) between  amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], ramipril, and 
valsartan treatment groups using a two-sample t-te st. If normality of the da ta is in question, we 
will utilize corresponding nonparametric tests. We will test all hypothesis at the level of α=0.05. 
We will use SPSS for Windows (Version 22.0, SPSS, Ch icago) and the open source statistical 
package R (version 2.12, R Development Core Team, 2006) for analyses.  
Because subjects who drop out will be repla ced and based on prior experience, missing 
data will be unusual. Nevertheless, if data are missing for a particular ti me point, mixed-effects 
models are robust in that subjects with missing data at some time poi nts can be included to estimate 
effects of interest. In addition, we will conservatively impute missi ng data to perform corroborative 
analyses with and without missing data.  Interim analysis

12.[ADDRESS_938314] Techniques  Blood Pressure Measurements: During screening, washout, and active treatment outpatient 
blood pressure will be measured with an aner oid sphygmomanometer (Welch Allyn, Skaneateles 
Falls, NY), using the appearance and complete disappearance of the Korotokoff sounds (K1 and 
K5) as SBPs and DBPs. The mean of three supi [INVESTIGATOR_161213]. During study days, 
blood pressure will be measured every 5 min using an automated oscillometric recording device (Dinamap, Critikon, Carlsbad, CA).  Power Spectral Analysis : Blood pressure fluctuates with a 10-second periodicity, and these 
fluctuations are commonly termed “Mayer” waves. The low frequency variability (LF
SBP) is 
thought to reflect sympathetic re gulation of vasomotor tone. LF SBP is increased by [CONTACT_161244], such as upright posture, lower body ne gative pressure, or infusion 
of depressor substances47 and correlates with direct measur ements of sympathetic traffic using

 microneurography. A derivative-threshold algorithm pr ovided the continuous series of RR 
intervals from ECG signal, continuous non-invasive BP from finger arterial pressure (Finapress 
2300, Ohmeda, Madison, WI), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] w ill be recorded. All the data recorded will be 
used for determination of  spectral analysis. Beat-to-beat data  will be digitized  using the WINDAQ 
data acquisition system (DI 220, DATAQ, Akron, OH, 14 Bit, 1000Hz) and processed off-line 
using a custom-written software in  PV-Wave language (PV-wave, Vi sual Numerics Inc., Houston, 
TX). Detected beat-to-beat values of R-R intervals and blood pressure values will be interpolated 
and low pass filtered (cutoff 2 Hz). Data segments of interest are used for spectral analysis. Linear trends will be removed, and power spectral dens ity will be estimated with the FFT-based Welch 
algorithm. The power in the frequency range of low frequencie s (LF: 0.04 to <0.15 Hz), and high 
frequencies (HF: 0.15 to < 0.40 Hz) will be calculated according to the Task Force 
recommendations.
48  
   Assays:  All blood samples will be centrifuged for 20 minutes immediately following blood drawing. 
Plasma will be storage at -80°C until analysis.   Substance P and NPY:  Plasma samples will be collected in a protease cocktail inhibitor containing 
an aminopeptidase P inhib itor (apstatin), DPP4 inhi bitor (vildagliptin), seri ne protease inhibitor 
(phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), ETA, and phosphoramidon to avoid ex vivo degradation of the 
peptides. NPY will be concentrated from plas ma by [CONTACT_161240]-NPY 
monoclonal antibody (NPY02) coupled to magnetic  beads, followed by C18 micro-e xtraction 
(Ziptip, Millipore). Recovery (~70%) will be calculated using 13C, 15N-labeled internal standards for NPY and NPY (3-36). NPY and NPY (3-36) w ill be quantified usin g liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with ultra-high- pressure liquid chromatography (UPLC, Waters 
Xevo TQS) using a modification of [CONTACT_161250]’s previously published method that allows 
detection of physiologic concentrat ions NPY and its metabolites in  plasma. We have previously 
used HPLC to separate substance P from substance P (3-11) prior to  assay, but this method is labor 
intensive. For this reason we have recently developed a method using immunoaffinity extraction 
using magnetic beads [kit (LSKMAGN01) from EMD Millip ore] followed by [CONTACT_180269]-MS/MS. The 
absolute limit of detection of substance P is 5 pg injected. The sensitivity in plasma is currently less than this (500 pg/mL) due to ion suppression. We are working w ith our colleagues in the Mass 
Spectrometry Core and expect to resolve this, but an alternative approach remains to use HPLC 
separation followed by [CONTACT_28745]- linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). 
  RAS parameters : We will measure PRA (DiaSorin, Stillwater , MN),90 Ang II (drawn in a cocktail 
of protease inhibitors; Nichols Institute Dia gnostic, San Clemente, CA), and aldosterone [MP 
Biomedicals, Irvine, CA utilizin g 125I, with a primary antibody to aldosterone (NIDDK National 
Hormone and Peptide Program, Torrance, CA) a nd a secondary gamma gl obulin antibody (Linco 
Research, St. Charles, MO)] by [CONTACT_691840]. We will meas ure ACE (Olympus 
AU400/AU600, Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, NH) a nd DPP4 activity by [CONTACT_691841].

Plasma catecholamines:  Catecholamines will be quantified  after batch alumin a extraction by [CONTACT_5019]-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using electrochemical detection. The concentrations 
of [3H]NE in plasma and the infusate will be measured in fractions of the column effluent 
corresponding to the retention time of NE. Fractions will be collected in scintillation vials and the 
3H activity assayed by [CONTACT_558351] (LS 6000IC, Beckma n Instruments Inc).  
 Glucose, C-peptide, and Insulin: Plasma glucose will be measur ed by [CONTACT_691842] a YSI glucose analyzer (YSI Life Sc iences, Yellow Springs, OH). Plasma insulin 
concentrations will be determined by [CONTACT_69727]. The insulin assay cross-reacts with 38% intact human 
pro-insulin and with C-peptide, ≤0.01%. Samples for C-peptide and glucagon will be drawn into 
heparinized tubes containing 250 KI U Trasylol (Aprotinin) per mL of whole blood. This will result 
in a final concentration of approximately 500 KIU Trasylol per mL of serum or plasma. C-peptide 
will be measured using RIA (Millipore).

The following is given to you to tell you about this research study. Please read this form with care and ask any questions you may have 
about this study. Your questions will be answered. Also, you will be given a copy of this consent form.  
 
You do not have to be in this research study. You can stop being in this study at any time. If we learn something new that may 
affect the risks or benefits of this study, you will be told so that you can decide whether or not you still want to be in this study.  
Your medical record will contain a note saying you are in a research study. Any one you authorize to receive your medical 
record will also get this note.    
 
   
1. What is the purpose of this study?  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have high blood pressure and type [ADDRESS_938319] blood pressure in someone taking 
certain drugs that help treat high blood pressure. About 150 people will take part in this study.

Screening vi sit 1 
 If you decide to take part in the study, you will come to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC). You will 
have a complete physical, including height, weight, and waist. We will ask you about your medical history. We will 
take your blood (abo ut 4 teaspoons) to check that you have no problems to keep you from being in the study . If you 
agr
ee, part of this blood will be used for DNA (genetic testing.) 
 
If you qualify to be in the study, you will be asked to stop taking your blood pressure drugs for 3 weeks. If you take 
hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), you may continue taking it while in the study. If you take spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407] (Aldactone), 
you will be asked to stop taking it for [ADDRESS_938320] week and once a week after that with a blood pressure 
monitor we will give you. If your blood pressure gets too high (upper number 170 or more, lower number 110 or 
more), you will be taken out of the study and restarted on your regular medicine.  
 
If you are already taking metformin, you will continue taking it. If you take other medications for your diabetes, we 
will ask you to stop taking them for at least [ADDRESS_938321] week and once a week after that. If your blood sugar gets too low (70 mg/dL or 
less) or too high (300mg/dL or more), we will take you out of the study and restart you on your regular medicine.

Consent for Genetic Research 
 
The purpose of this study is to look at genes (DNA) and how they affect health and disease. Genes are the instruction 
manual for your body. The genes you get from your parents decide what you look like and how your body behaves. 
They can also tell us a person’s risk for certain diseases and how they will respond to treatment.  
 
You are being asked to give a blood sample for genetic research. What we learn about you from this sample will not be 
put in your health record. Your test results will not be shared with you or your doctor. No one else (like a relative, boss, 
or insurance company) will be given your test results. Health insurance companies and group health plans may not 
request your genetic information that comes from this research.  
 
A single blood sample of 2 teaspoons will be taken from your arm at the same time we are taking another sample. This 
will not take any extra time. 
 
One risk of giving samples for this research may be the release of your name [CONTACT_691848]/or the results of the tests run on your samples. This may cause problems with insurance or getting a job.  
 
Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions 
regarding your eligibility or premiums. Employers with [ADDRESS_938336] access to your name.   
 
Your sample will be used to make DNA that will be kept for an unknown length of time (maybe years) for future 
research. The sample will be destroyed when it is no longer needed. 
 
Your samples and information about you may be shared with others to use for research. To protect your privacy, we will 
not release your name. 
 
You will not receive any benefit as a result of the tests done on your samples. These tests may help us learn more 
about the causes, risks, treatments, or how to prevent this and other health problems.  
 
Giving samples for research is your free choice and you may be in the study even if you do not want your samples used 
or stored for gene research. 
 
At any time, you may ask to have your sample destroyed. You should contact

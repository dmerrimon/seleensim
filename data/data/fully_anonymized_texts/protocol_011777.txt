1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 The Need for Quantify Antiretroviral Adherence  
 Adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy is critical for achieving HIV RNA suppression in HIV -infected 
patients and for preventing HIV acquisition in uninfected individuals using pre- exposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP). Yet a high level of adherence is challenging for HIV -infected individuals on life -long ARVs, and for 
HIV-negative individuals using daily PrEP who are not at daily risk for HIV acquisition. Poor adherence 
was primarily responsible for a lack of drug effectiveness in multiple recent double- blind, placebo-
controlled PrEP studies. These studies found that counting product returns and using patient self -report 
significantly over predicted adherence as measured by [CONTACT_18096], dried blood 
spots,  or cells.  
Since the consequences of poor or intermittent adherence are significant, valid measures of adherence 
are critical for optimizing  the effectiveness of both HIV treatment and prevention, in both the clinic al and 
research settings. Measuring drug concentrations is a more accurate measure of adherence than is self -
report.  Blood plasma or intracellular concentration monitoring have been  considered the “gold standard” 
for determining if an ARV has been ingested, and is a common marker for therapeutic drug monitoring or clinical trial adherence monitoring. However, this approach has its own set of limitations, including being invasive, requiring advanced processing or storage (e.g. intracellular measures), being a short -term 
measure of drug taking behavior (depending on the half -life of the analyte), and requiring long turn-
around times or substantial sample processing prior to analysis. Up per layer packed cells (ULPC) and 
Dried blood spot (DBS) analysis have been used as alternatives to plasma.  DBS was  generated as a 
less invasive, simple, and validated alternative to traditional venous sampling.  The advantages are that it can involve mor e minimally invasive sampling, even with a small finger prick.  Most analytes are more 
stable in DBS than in frozen sample, which also translates to convenient storage and transport.  Since blood plasma, ULPC,  and dried blood spot analysis are valid indust ry standards to assess patient 
adherence, we will use them both in this research as comparators to hair concentrations.   
We propose the use of infra- red (IR) matrix -assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI) 
technology for mass spectromet ry imaging (MSI) to visualize and quantify ARV concentrations in hair. Our 
hypothesis is that IR -MALDESI MSI can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_18066], provide evidence of drug 
ingestion non- invasively and longitudinally, and allow for clinician/researcher and patient/study participant 
feedback on adherence performance. We were awarded a grant from the NIH to begin to evaluate the 
feasibility and acceptability of this technology.  Three specific aims of our grant are proposed: 1) Develop 
IR-MALDESI MSI hair p rotocols for high sensitivity and accuracy to quantify 11 ARVs in 5 therapeutic 
17 
 drug classes, 2) Conduct 3 structured dose proportionality studies to develop mathematical benchmarks 
for real -time IR -MALDESI hair adherence monitoring in both PrEP and HIV tr eatment applications, and 
validate the benchmarks with a Phase 2 PrEP study, and 3) In the setting of REAL TIME clinical 
monitoring, investigate the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of using hair IR -MALDESI MSI to 
provide HIV+ patients with feedback regarding longitudinal patterns of medication adherence. The goal of 
this work is to develop a simple, noninvasive, longitudinal depi[INVESTIGATOR_18067].  
 
In AIM 1, over t he last year we have completed collection of numerous hair samples from p articipants  of 
different genders, races, and evaluated the effect of hair treatments (i.e. coloring, chemicals, etc.) to 
facilitate formulating this protocol in the most informed way.  In our AIM [ADDRESS_17012] trouble remembering if, and when, they miss doses; 
other times, even though patients are taki ng their medication, it is not getting into the body in the correct 
amount.  Quickly monitoring medications in 5- 10 hair strands using our novel imaging technology called 
IR-MALDESI will allow patients and their doctors to see how much medicat ion they are exposed to over 
one or more months, and help identify challenges to taking medication in both research and clinical 
settings.  This proposal will optimize and explore the accuracy and feasibility of using IR -MALDESI for 
monitoring medications in hair in comparison to the current industry standards.  
1.3 Dose Proportionality
 
 
Dose proportionality occurs when an r fold increase in dose results in an r fold increase in exposure, 
which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_18068] C max or AUC (Hummel et al. 2009).  Dose proportionality is important when 
considering how to predict the change in drug exposure and its corresponding biologic response with a 
change in dose.  We are concerned with the proportionality between dose and the corr esponding 
concentration in the hair.  In order to reliably predict hair exposure, confidence in dose proportionality is 
necessary.   Our goal is to prove this dose proportionality relationship in order to develop mathematical 
benchmarks for real -time IR -MADLESI hair adherence monitoring in both PrEP and HIV treatment 
applications.   
1.4 Background  (See Appendix III)  
Tenofovir Exhibits Modest Dose -Proportionality in Hair with LC -MS/MS Analysis Data from Liu et al 
(88; Figure 5 ) determined that a log- linear r elationship can be seen between TFV dose and hair 
concentrations, with an estimated 76% (95% CI 60- 93%) increase in hair level per 2- fold dose increase. 
However, the between- patient variability is large. Assuming this relationship holds for other ARVs, thi s 
precludes the use of LC -MS/MS methods in determining, with precision, <[ADDRESS_17013] over 5 years of experience investigating the pharmacokinetics of these ARVs in parti cular (3,25,37,63,113).  We also 
have experience with enrolling and retaining healthy volunteers in observed dosing studies: our participation in HPTN066 successfully enrolled and followed 19 (60% of total enrolled) patients with the following dosing strategies for the fixed dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + FTC: 1 tablet weekly, 1 tablet twice weekly, 2 tablets twice weekly, and 1 tablet daily for 35 days ( 68). 
Multi -compartment Pharmacokinetics and Dose Proportionality Investigation s In this aim, we will 
conduct population PK modeling of IR MALDESI MSI data in hair with multiple dosing strategies using a 
multi -compartmental approach (plasma, PBMCs [for intracellular TFVdp and  
FTCtp], and hair). We have significant experience modeling complex systems. Recently, we have 
developed models to predict ARV active metabolite exposure, based on  
dose, in mucosal tissues ( 174,35; Figure 6 ). This model was based on dose proportionality investigations 
we recently completed for TFV, TFVdp, FTC, FTCtp, and MRV in plasma, PBMCs, and tissues (35-

and hair collected at set intervals over that subsequent month.  Participants  will immediately follow into 
Phase 3, where they will be randomized to one of 3 dosing schemas including: no further doses, a sing le 
dose once weekly, and three doses per week.   
Participants  will return to the clinical research center during all 3 phases, on days 3/7/14/21/[ADDRESS_17017] study staff at any time as needed.  
The participants will be sequentially assigned to one of three dosing groups: Maraviroc, 
Tenofovir/Emtricitabine, and then Dolutegravir .  After participant education, informed consent, and 
screening for study eligibility, participants will be evaluated at baseline (before the dose).  
Within [ADDRESS_17018] dose:  
• Blood (Plasma, ULPC,  and Dried Blood Spot s) 
• Hair 
• PBMCs (In the Tenofovir arm ONLY)  
 2.[ADDRESS_17019] recently, in the study generated during AIM 1 of this 
grant, the study team obtained 84 hair samples from cli nic patients within 9 months. These were 
performed successfully and there were no adverse eve nts or unanticipated problems. As part of the 
screening and informed consent process, every participant will receive a detailed description of the procedures involved and the intensity of the protocol.

3.1 Selection of the Study Population  
 
3.1.1 Recruitment  
 
Our study Participants  will be recruited from the Chapel Hill -Raleigh- Durham area (an area with a 
population of approximately 3 million).  We will use the following recruitment strategies:   
• Placing IRB approved advertisements in the university -based (Daily Tar Heel) and two local 
newspapers (Chapel Hill News, and Daily News and Observer)  
• Posting IRB approved flyers around the UNC -CH campus  
• Sending IRB approved emails to the UNC -CH campus listserv 
• Posting IRB -approved text to ResearchMatch.org  
• Contact a list of Participants  who have expressed interest in any of our previous healthy volunteer 
studies  
Potential Participants  are given an email address or a phone number to call if they are interested, and the 
study coordinator conducts a brief initial IRB -approved screening interview over the phone in a private 
area to determine further eligibility.  If the subject is potentially eligible, a screening visit is scheduled; if 
one or more of the basic inclusion criteria are not met, the subject is informed that they are not eligible.

6. SAFETY MONITORING AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
6.[ADDRESS_17047] layer of this tiered system and are responsible for the initial evaluation and 
reporting of safety information at the participant level, and for alerting the Protocol Safety Review Team 
(PSRT ) if unexpected concerns arise.   The PSRT will consist of the following study site investigators: 
Angela Kashuba, PharmD (Principle Investigator), Cindy Gay, MD (Study Physician), Heather Prince, PA -
C (Study Physician’s Assistant), Amanda Poliseno (Research Coordinator) along with the Biostatistician.  
During the trial, the PSRT will review safety reports ( all AEs included, independent of determination of 
relatedness to study products)  and conduct calls to review the data as appropriate.  The content, format 
and frequency of the safety reports will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_18108]. 
In addition to these routine safety data reviews, the PSRT will convene on an ad hoc basis to make 
decisions regarding the handling of any significant safety concerns. If necessary, ex perts external to the 
protocol team,  representing expertise in the fields of microbicides, biostatistics, and medical ethics may be 
invited to join the PSRT safety review.  
[ADDRESS_17048].  As such, an AE can be an unfavorable or unintende d sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product.  This definition is applied to all the 
study groups, and is applied to all groups beginning from the time of sequential assignment . The term 
“investigational product” for this study refers to all study products listed in this protocol . Study participants 
will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_18109] -up.  In the case of a life- threatening event, they will be instructed to seek immediate 
emergency care. Where feasible and medically appropriate, participants will be encouraged to seek evaluation where the study clinician is based, and to request that the clinician be contact[CONTACT_18110]. Sites will obtain written permission from the participant to obtain and use records from non- study 
medical providers to complete any missing data element on a CRF related to an adverse event.  All 
participants reporting an untoward medical occurrence will be followed clinically, until the occurrence resolves (returns to baseline) or stabilizes.  
The site physicians will determine AE resolution or stabilization in their best clinical judgment, but may seek 
PSRT medical consultation regarding follow -up or additional evaluations of an AE.  Study site staff will 
document in source documents all AEs reported by [CONTACT_18111]. Study staff also will record all AEs on case report forms.  
 6.3 Serious  Adverse Events  
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be defined by [CONTACT_18112] (Version 2. 1, dated March 2017) as AEs occurring at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect    
• Requires inpatient hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18074]:  
  
• Protocol -specified admission (e.g. for procedure required by 
[CONTACT_18113])  
• Admission for treatment of target disease of the study, or for pre-existing condition (unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18075] c linical 
investigator)  
• Diagnostic admission (e.g. for a work -up of an existing condition 
such as persistent pretreatment lab abnormality)  
• Administrative admission (e.g. for annual physical)  
31 
 • Social admission (e.g. placement for lack of place to sleep)  
• Elective admission (e.g. for elective surgery)  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9475] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.   
Study staff will report all AEs that meet serious adverse event (SAE) reporting requirements according to 
the DAIDS -defined “standard” reporting requirements.  Information on all AEs will be included in reports to 
the US FDA, and other applicable government and regulatory authorities.  Study staff will report information on all AEs and SAEs to the IRB in accordance with all app licable regulations and 
requirements.   
6.[ADDRESS_17049] will be assessed per the Manual for Expedited Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIDS (Version 2. 1, dated March 2017). Per t he Manual for Expedited Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIDS (Version 2.1, dated March 2017), the relationship categories that will be used for 
this study are:

6.5 Grading Severity of Events  
 
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification  dated August 2009), Addenda 1 and 3 (Female Genital and Rectal Grading Tables for Use in Microbicide Studies) will be the primary tools for grading adverse events for this protocol.  Adverse events not included in those tables will be graded by [CONTACT_18114] 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009). In cases where an AE is covered in all tables, the DAIDS 
AE Grading Table, Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009), Addendum 1 (Vaginal 
Gradi ng Table for Use in Microbicide Studies) ,and Addendum 3 (Rectal Grading Table for Use in 
Microbicide Studies) will be the grading scale utilized.  
6.6 Pregnancy and Pregnancy Outcomes   
Pregnancy -related data will be collected using the pregnancy CRFs for all pregnancies detected during the 
study.  Pregnancy outcomes will not be expeditiously reported to DAIDS,  unless there is an associated 
adverse event in the pregnant participant that meets expedited reporting criteria or the pregnancy results 
in a congen ital anomaly meeting the Manual for Expedited Reported of Adverse Events to DAIDS (Version 
2.1, March 2017) guidelines for expedited reporting.  Fetal losses without congenital anomalies or maternal 
complications that require expedited reporting will not be expeditiously reported but data will be captured via the pregnancy CRFs.    
After the participant’s follow -up study visit, the study team will make every attempt to follow the participant 
32 
 until an outcome of the pregnancy can be ascertained to allow reporting of these outcomes meeting EAE 
criteria.  P regnancy outcomes that meet criteria for EAE reporting as described above (e.g., maternal 
complications, congenital anomalies) occurring among participants known to be pregnant at the Final Study Visit wi ll continue to be expeditiously reported.  
 6.[ADDRESS_17050] participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible that 
participants' involvement in the study could become known to others, and that social harms may result .  For 
example, participants could be treated unfairly or discriminated against, or could have problems being 
accepted by [CONTACT_18115]/or communities. Social harms that are judged by [CONTACT_18116], or according to 
their individual requirements. In the event that a participant reports social harm, every effort will be made 
by [CONTACT_18117], and/or referral to appropriate 
resources for the safety of the participant as needed.  While maintaining participant confidentiality, study sites may engage their CABs in exploring the social context surrounding instances of social harm.  
 
7. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT  
In general, the site investigator has the discretion to discontinue study product at any time if she feels that 
continued product use would be harmful to the participant or interfere with treatment deemed clinically necessary.  Unless otherwise specified below, the investigator should immediately consult the PSRT for further guidance regarding permanent discontinuation.  
The site investigator or designee will document all discontinuations on applicable case report forms.  
7.[ADDRESS_17051](s) in the Presence of Toxicity  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_18076].  If a single subject 
experiences a Serious Adverse Event, enrollment will be held while the protocol undergoes review.  If 2 or 
more participants  experience Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events, enrollment will be held while the 
protocol undergoes  review.  If 5 or more p articipants  experience Ser ious Adverse Events or Grade 
3/Grade 4 adverse events deemed by [CONTACT_18118], the study 
will be stopped while the safety concerns of using these variable doses o f study medication are reviewed.  
Any Grade 3 or 4 or serious adverse event related to a study intervention (blood draw, biopsy) or the 
study drugs (tenofovir, maraviroc, emtricitabine, Dolutegravir ) will result in subject discontinuation. 
Participants  who are withdrawn for safety reasons will complete a follow -up visit within [ADDRESS_17052] their safety and/or if they are unwilling or unable to 
comply with required study procedures, after consultation with the PSRT. Participants also may be 
withdrawn if the study sponsors, government or regulatory authorities (including the Office of Human 
Research Protections), or site IRBs terminate the study prior to its planned end date.  Every reasonable 
effort is made to complete a final evaluation of participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study 
prior to completing follow -up.  Study st aff members will record the reason(s) for all withdrawals in 
participants’ study records.  In the event that participants  who voluntarily withdraw from the study wish to 
re-join the study, they may resume product use (if applicable) and follow -up through t heir originally 
scheduled study exit date.  
 
8. DATA MANAGEMENT AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
8.1 Data Management Responsibilities  
The study site will maintain source data/documents in accordance with Requirements for Source 
Documentation in DAIDS Funded and/or Sponsored Clinical Trials 
(http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/LabsAndResources/resources/DAIDSClinRsrch/PDF/Source DocPolicy.pdf ).  
The investigator will maintain, and store securely, comp lete, accurate and current study records throughout 
the study. The investigator will retain all study records for at least  three years following the completion of 
the study, unless directed otherwise by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH). Study records must be 
maintained on site for the entire period of study implementation.  
8.[ADDRESS_17053] quality control and quality assurance procedures in accordance with 
Requirements for Clinical Quality Management Plans at DAIDS Funded and/or Supported Clinical Research Sites available at: 
(http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/DAIDSClinRsrch/PDF/QMPPolicy.pdf
).  
8.[ADDRESS_17054], data management, clinical monitoring, personnel training 
and regulatory requirements will be performed in accordance to policies governed by [CONTACT_18119] . These  policies are located in 
department SOPs . 
 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Biostatistics Core is collaborating with us for our statistical plan on 
this grant.  
 9.[ADDRESS_17055] variability will be determined from these models. Dose proportionality 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_18120] a power model of the form 
{} ) log( ) log(1 0 dose y E ββ+= , where 𝑦𝑦 
denotes drug (ARV) concentration and 11β=corresponds to perfect dose proportionality. The power 
model will be fit and the 90% confidence interval (CI) for 1β will be compared to a pre- specified critical 
region. If the CI falls within this critical region, then the data support dose proportionality. This critical 
region is 


+ +)ln() ln(1,)ln() ln(1r rU Lθ θ where r is the ratio of the highest dose to the lowest dose, 80.0=Lθ , 
and 25.1=Uθ .  
 
9.2 Power and Sample Size Calculation:   
 
Through a series of simulation studies conducted using R -project, it was determined that 12 participants 
per ARV treatment group will be sufficient to achieve > 99% power to establish dose proportionality (i.e., 
assuming 11β=). For these simulation studies, we assumed dose levels ranging from 1 dose per 28 
days to 1 dose per day over the three phases of study, yielding 28r= .  Concentrations where no drug 
is given (0 doses per day)  cannot be used when fitting the power model described above. To account for 
the same individual contributing repeated observations (corresponding to the three 28 day phases of 
observation), a mixed effects power model was used in the empi[INVESTIGATOR_18077]. Values for the 
between-  and within -individual variability were assumed based on a natural -log transformation of pi[INVESTIGATOR_18078] -
MALDESI response per voxel data from participants taking efavirenz. The estimated within- individual 
standard deviation [SD] was  0.10 and estimated between- individual SD was 0.52.  
 
9.3 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan  
Initial data exploration will be utilized to produce descriptive statistics and exploratory plots. Nonlinear 
mixed effects modeling with NONMEM (ICON plc, Ireland) will be used to construct population PK models 
describing the pharmacokinetics of TFV, FTC, MVC, and DTG in plasma, PBMC, and hair (101,102). The 
structural model will consist of a compartment for each matrix, with possible transit compartments from 
plasma to hair. Linearity will initially be assumed yet will be subsequently assessed. If the PK r elationship 
35 
 is found to be nonlinear, saturation terms can be added to the model parameters. Various structural 
models will be explored with Berkley Madonna software (University of [LOCATION_004], Berkeley) to generate plausible candidate models (80). The best  model will be chosen depending on the objective function and 
model performance diagnostics such as visual predictive checks. Bayesian analysis (83) using existing published PK models (12, 29,159,162) can also be added to model parameters if necessary for uncertain 
parameters such as drug uptake into hair (5, 38) and clearance. Once the base model is constructed, 
demographic covariates such as weight, BMI, creatinine clearance, age, gender, and race will also be 
tested for significance one at a time. Scient ific input and previous research findings will be used to inform 
selection of a multivariable model. Monte Carlo simulations will be performed with the model to generate prediction intervals to both explore other possible dosing regimens and for adherence assessments in HPTN 069. (Aim 2b) In addition, localized drug concentrations within a hair strand will also be modeled using partial differential equations (e.g., via Matlab). This physiologic -based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
modeling approach has previously b een done to characterize localized drug concentrations in tumor. (31, 
42). This will enable a more granular estimation of dosing history from continuous drug concentration 
distribution within a hair strand. Initially, various models will be explored and on e with the most 
physiologic relevance will be fit to the data. Variance will also be added to various parameters to describe 
the data on a population level. Monte- Carlo simulations can be performed to generate prediction intervals 
of drug concentration alo ng the length of the hair under various dosing regimens.
 
  
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  
The investigators will make efforts to minimize risks to participants. Volunteers and study staff members 
will take part in a thor ough informed consent process. Befor e beginning the study, the investigators will 
have obtained IRB approval . The investigators  will permit audits by [CONTACT_18121]/DAIDS , the FDA or any of their 
appointed agents.  
10.[ADDRESS_17056] annually and within three months of the study termination or 
completion.  These reports will include the total number of participants enrolled in the study, the number of participants who completed the study, all changes in the research activity , and all unanticipated problems 
involving risks to human p articipants  or others.   
10.2 Risks  
• Blood Draws:  Risks associated with blood draws include bleeding, discomfort, feelings of 
dizziness or faintness, and/or bruising, swelling and/or infection.   
 
• Hair Collection: There are no known associated risks with collection of hair.  
 
• STI Screening/Reporting:  Disclosure of STI status may cause sadness or depression in 
volunteers.  Partner notification of STI status may cause problems in their relationships w ith their 
sexual partners. Additionally, participants could misunderstand the current experimental status of 
the study medication and as a result increase their HIV risk behaviors while in the study.  The 
following STIs are required by [CONTACT_18122]: 
36 
 HIV, Syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia,  Hepatitis B and C . 
 
• Unknown Risks:  There are always a potential for unknown problems to arise.  Participants will 
be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_18123] t a problem.   
 
• Confidentiality:  Participation in clinical research includes the risks of loss of confidentiality and 
discomfort with personal nature of questions. Although the study site makes  every effort to protect 
participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible that participants’ involvement in the study 
could become known to others, and that social harms may result.  
  
 
• Study Medications  
The known toxicities for a single dose of these ant iretrovirals in this protocol .  Listed below are 
the pregnancy categories for the medications.  
 
- Tenofovir:  TDF is a pregnancy category B medication.  No controlled human studies of 
TDF among pregnant women have been conducted.   Animal studies have shown 
decreased fetal growth and reduced fetal bone porosity.  No increased risk of overall birth defects has been observed following first trimester exposure according to data collected by [CONTACT_18124] (Lexi -Comp).  
 
- Emtricitabine: FTC is a pregnancy category B medication.  No controlled human studies 
of FTC among pregnant women have been conducted.  Adverse events were not 
observed in animal studies and no increased risk of overall birth defects has been observed according to data collected by [CONTACT_18124] (Lexi -
Comp).  
 
- Dolutegravir : Dolutegravir is a pregnancy category B .  There have been no animal 
studies that have documented fetal risk, and no studies testing Dolutegravir in pregnant women.  
 
- Maraviroc: Maraviroc is a pregnancy category B.  Adverse fetal effects were not seen in 
animal studies, however, there have been no studies testing maraviroc in pregnant women.   
 
10.[ADDRESS_17057] will be provided with a photocopy of all documents that she signs. The informed consent process will cover all elements of informed consent required by [CONTACT_18125]. In addition, the 
process specifically will address the fo llowing topi[INVESTIGATOR_18079]:  
• The unknown safety and unproven efficacy of the study products  
• The need to practice safer sex behaviors regardless of study treatment group  
• The importance of participants in all four study groups to the success of the study  
• The importance of adherence to the study visit and procedures schedule  
• The potential medical risks of study participation (and what to do if such risks are experienced)  
• The potential social harms associated with study participation (an d what to do if such harms are 
experienced)  
• The real yet limited benefits of study participation  
• The distinction between research and clinical care  
• The right to withdraw from the study at any time  
 
The informed consent process will include an assessment  of each potential participant’s understanding 
prior to enrollment and sequential assignment of concepts identified by [CONTACT_18126].  Participants who are not able to demonstrate adequate understanding of key concepts after exhaustive educational efforts will not be enrolled in the study.     
10.[ADDRESS_17058]’s name, social security number, address, telephone 
number, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18080] (MR) number.  The principal investigators and study staff will be the 
only people with access to the identifying information.  Any information pr ovided to other people working 
on this study will be given with the study ID number, not other identifying information.  The records will be secured in a locked file cabinet in the principal investigator’s office.  
All electronic data for this study will be stored on a dedicated University server which contains extensive 
protections and securities.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_17059] s at all study  visits, and additionally if clinically indicated .  During the informed consent 
38 
 process, women will be informed that none of the study products are methods of contraception and about  
the current knowledge of effects of these pr oducts on a developi[INVESTIGATOR_18081].    
 
10.6.2 Children  
  
The NIH has mandated that children be included in research trials when appropriate. This study meets “Justifications for Exclusion” criteria for younger children as set forth by [CONTACT_18121]. Specifically, “insufficient data are available in adults to judge pot ential risk in children” and “children should not be the initial group 
to be involved in research studies.” This study does not plan to enroll children under [ADDRESS_17060] counseling.  Participants 
found to be HIV -infected will be referred to available sources of medical and psychosocial care and support, 
and local research studies for HIV -infected adults.  
 10.12 Study Discontinuation  
This study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_18127] /DAIDS , the US FDA, the OHRP, or the site IRB.

from the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_17717].  
4. 20-[ADDRESS_17069] 1 centimeter long should be isolated and cut.  
5. Cut the small hair sample off the participant’s ahead as close to the scalp as possible.  
6. Lay the small hair sample onto the pi[INVESTIGATOR_18086] a small label with the 
participant’s Study ID over the distal end of the hair thatch (affixing the hair sample to the tin foil in the 
process). The distal end is the portion furthest from the scalp. It is very important to place the label at 
the distal end as this will distinguish the scalp end from the distal end.  
7. Refo ld the foil over to completely enclose the thatch of hair.  
8. Place a StudyID label on outside of the folded pi[INVESTIGATOR_18087].  
9. Place the folded pi[INVESTIGATOR_18088] a Ziplock bag with a dessicant bag in it and seal the Ziplock bag.  
[ADDRESS_17070] prior to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9107].  
                
Each packet of hair is to be folded to approximately 3” x 3” and labeled with the StudyID and visit 
on the upper portion of the packet.

Step 1: Clean the blades of a pair of scissors with an alcohol pad and allow blades to completely dry  
Clean off blades of scissors between patients  
 
Step 2: Lift up the top layer of hair from the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_18085]. Isolate a small thatch of hair (20‐
30 strands) from underneath this top layer

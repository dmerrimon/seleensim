tissue sarcoma (STS), as well as provide preliminary evidence of benef it 
for patients with osteosarcoma or liposarcoma.
This is a single arm two-sta ge Simon optimum Phase II study of 
pazopanib and topotecan with progression-f ree rate at 12 weeks as the 
primary outcom e. The historic PD free rate at 12 weeks for single agent 
pazopanib is 55%.  To detect a 20% improvement (an 11% absolute 
improvement)  with the combinati on of pazopanib and topotecan in a 
single-arm two-sta ge optimum design and a one-t ailed exact binomial p-

first stage when the true rate is 55%.
Up to  36 patients with osteosarcoma and 20 patients with liposarcoma 
will be enrolled to obtain explorat ory informati on for patients with these 
two histol ogies.
The DSMC reviewed the interim analysis data on 1/11/2017, and has

71.0 INT RODUC TION – BACKG ROUN D & RATI ONALE
1.1   So ft tissue and Bone Sarcom a- disease backgrou nd and current treatment 
strategie s
Soft Tissue  Sarcomas (STS) are malignant tumors arising from mesenchymal tissue in 
the extre mities, trunk, retroperit oneum, or head and neck. STS comprise a 
hetero geneous group of tumors, each with distinct histological, cytological, and 
molecular features.[ADDRESS_189426] an improvement in disease free survival, with little or no
improve ment in overall survival.6-8 Adjuvant therapy is often utilized in chemosensit ive 
subtypes, such as rhabdomyosarcoma,  osteo sarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040]
a mu ltimodalit y approach, development of distan t metastases remains high,  with 30-
60% of pat ients developi[INVESTIGATOR_163178].
For a dvanced disease, there is an established clinical benef it from chemoth erapy yet 
progn osis remains poor and 5 year overall survival rates remain less than 20%.[ADDRESS_189427] ing vasculat ure. 
Regulati on of angiogenesis is complex, involving an intricate interplay between 
endoth elial cells, support cells, bone marrow derived stem cells,
and growth factors within the tumor and tumor microenvironment. Under normal 
circumstan ces, regul ation of angiogenesis is mainta ined through balance of pro- 
angiogenic and ant i-angiogenic factors . In malignancy driven angiogenesis,  the 
balance is shifted in favor of more pro-angiogenic signaling, often referred to as the 
angiogenic switc h.13-16
Tumor an giogenesis is largely regulated through vascular endoth elial growt h factor 
(VEGF).17-[ADDRESS_189428] is made up of  three receptors (VEGFR- 1, 2, 3) and 
seven ligands (VEGF A, B, C, D, E, PI[INVESTIGATOR_12252]-1, 2). These ligands bind to their related 
receptors on endoth elial cells result ing in downstrea m intra-cellular signaling that 
promote s endoth elial growt h, migrati on, and survival outsi de of the existi ng 
vasculatu re.20,[ADDRESS_189429] s that other pathways such as the platel et derived growth 
factor (PDGF) play a key role.23,24 PDGF receptors  (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ), are 
expressed on pericytes and smooth muscle cells, and regulate pericyte differenti ation,

vascular survival.25,26 They can also functi on as growth factor s, leading cells to 
progres s through the cell-cycle and avoid apoptosi s.27-29
VEGF  is expressed in a number of STS30 and the expression of VEGF has been 
associate d with higher tumor grade, increased ability to meta stasi ze, and decreased 
overall survival in certain subtypes of sarcoma.31-34 For example, in leiomyosarcoma, 
higher VEGF serum levels were associated with worse progn osis and shorter  overall 
survival.30,35  Platelet derived growt h factor  (PDGFR) also plays a role in STS 
angiogenesis and prolif eration, and PDGFR- beta expression has been associate d with 
higher grade  tumors.36 Furtherm ore, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1), an upstre am 
regulat or of VEGF, was a predict or of metastatic potential in sarcomas.[ADDRESS_189430]

III trial with Pazopanib has been complete d to date.
1.3   Pa zopanib in Sarcom a
Pazo panib, a synthe tic indazolyl pyrimidine,  is a multi -kinase inhibitor  of VE GFR-
1/2/3,  and to a lesser degree PDGFR-α/β, FGFR-1/2 , and c-Kit.44-46 In vivo studies 
showed dose-dependent tumor growth inhibiti on in a variet y of tumor xenograf ts by 
[CONTACT_107395] (colon, melanoma, prostat e, renal, breast,  lung).47 Pazopanib is thought to 
inhibit angiogenesis through attenuat ion of VEGFR-2 signaling. Pharmacokineti c 
analysis revealed that the steady-stat e concentra tion (Ctrough) for tumor growth 
inhibiti on in vivo was almost equivalent to the concent ration required for in vivo
inhibit ion of VEGFR-2 phosphorylat ion.47
Phase  I studies determined Pazopanib 800mg daily as the recommended monoth erapy 
dose.48 There is now plent iful evidence that single agent pazopanib has clinical benef it in 
advanced sarcomas. The phase II study (VEG20002) evaluat ed single agent pazopanib 
in patients with relapsed or refractor y soft tissue sarcoma.43
Treatme nt response data are available for 138 patients who received pazopanib 800 mg 
once daily. Ninet y-nine percent of pati ents had received prior chemoth erapy:  35 pati ents 
(25%) had received therapy in a (neo)-adjuvant  setting, 83 (59%) had received therapy 
in an advanced setting, and 22 (16%) had received both. The
prima ry endpoint  was the progression-f ree rate, using Response Evaluat ion Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) at 12 weeks after start of treatment. Patients with 
leiomyosarcoma,  synovial sarcoma and “the other types of sarcoma” strata  receiving 
pazopanib in VEG20002 experienced a 12 week progression free survival rate of ≥
40%,  the pre-def ined threshold indicati ng anti-t umor activity. The liposarcoma stratum did 
not meet its prespecif ied endpoint at the end of stage 1 and did not progress to stage 2.
Based  on the results of the VEG20002, a Phase III randomized,  double blind, placebo 
contro lled study (VEG110727) of pazopanib versus placebo in patients  with soft
tissue  sarcoma (study excluded patients  with GIST or liposarcoma) was initiated in
2008.49 372 patients were registere d and 369 were randomly assigned to receive 
pazopanib (n=246) or placebo (n=123). Median progre ssion-f ree survival was 4.6 
months (95% CI 3.7–4.8) for pazopanib compared with 1.6 months  (0.9–1.8) for 
placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.31, 95% CI 0.24–0.4 0; p<0.0001). Overall survival was
12.5 mo nths (10.6–14.8 ) with pazopanib versus 10.7 months (8.7–12.8) with placebo (HR 
0.86, 0.67–1.1 1; p=0.25). The most common adverse events were fatigue (60 in the  
placebo group [49%] vs 155 in the pazopanib group [65%]), diarrhea (20 [16%] vs
138 [58%]) , nausea (34 [28%] vs 129 [54%] ), weight loss (25 [20%]  vs 115 [48%] ),

10Based  on this evidence,  oral topotecan and pazopanib was evaluated in patients with

bioavailabilit y and safety results of daily pazopanib combined with weekly oral topotecan 
(Part2A) were present ed at the annual ASCO meeti ng in 2013.
Data is  available for [ADDRESS_189435] one dose of therapy- 7 pat ients in 
Part1; 21 patients in Part 2 ([ADDRESS_189436]  cancer, 1 renal cell 
carcinoma, 5 ovarian cancer, 2 osteo sarcoma, and 5 classif ied as “other”). 
Pharmacokineti c analysis revealed that topotecan AUC0-∞  increased 1.58-fold (90%CI:  
1.09–1.29) and Cmax increased 1.78-fold (90%CI: 1.08- 2.92) when  given with 
pazopanib compared to single administrat ion (n=7). However,  neithe r of these 
paramete rs were increased for pazopanib when given with topotecan.
During,  t he dose escalat ion phase (Part2A), Topote can was increased from 4mg to
10mg  (days 1, 8, 15) and Pazopanib was increased from 400mg to 800mg (q28 days). 
Three dose-limiti ng toxiciti es (DLT s) were experienced: grade 3 hand-f oot- syndrome, 
diarrhea and neutrope nia. Two of 6 patients had DLT wit h the combinati on of pazopanib

possible in 23pati ents: 9% achieved a PR (2/23);
57% achieved SD (13/23) and 35% developed PD (8/23). The phase II recommended

decreased efficacy in this group of pat ients . We will explore whethe r the combinat ion of 
pazopanib and oral topotecan will result in clinical benef it when evaluate d in pat ients 
with high grade, de-diff erenti ated, or myxoid liposarcoma.
Therefore, we propose to conduct a phase II trial of combinati on pazopanib and oral 
topotecan in patients with unresectab le or meta static soft tissue sarcoma, as well as 
provide preliminary evidence of benef it for patients with osteo sarcoma or liposarcoma to 
determ ine if further testing in these sarcoma subtypes is warrant ed. The target populat ion 
for this study is appropriat e given the toxicit y and lack of efficacy of chemoth erapy in 
patients with advanced disease.

Dose Modifications and Management of Liver toxicity
Reco mmendati ons for pazopanib dose interrupti ons/m odifications in case of liver-relate d 
treatment-emergent AEs are provided in Table III. As a general rule, since many subjects  
are taking multi ple concurrent  medicat ions, it is critical to (a) do a thorough evaluat ion of 
the subject ’s concurrent medicat ions (and ensure all are recorded in appropriat e forms) , 
and (b) identi fy and disconti nue those with known hepat otoxicit y and replace with a non-
hepato toxic equivalent for the same indicat ion if necessary.  Record alcohol use on 
appropriate forms. Liver dysfuncti on must be fully evaluat ed even if clinical signs and 
sympto ms indicate  progression of liver tumor lesions. Imaging studies must  be obtained 
to document potential progre ssion of malignancy.

All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest  diamete r <20

All measurabl e lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total,

All patients enrolled in the study should be assessed for response to treat ment, even if 
there are major protocol treatment deviat ions or patients exhibit object ive disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle 1.
All conclusions should be based on all enrolled patients . Subanalyses may then be 
performed on the basis of a subset of patients,  excluding those for whom major proto col 
deviat ions have been identi fied (e.g., early death due to other reasons,  early 
discont inuati on of treatment, treating an ineligible patient,  major proto col violat ions, etc.). 
However,  these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions 
concerning treatment eff icacy, and the reasons for excluding patients  from th e analysis 
should be clearly reported . The 95% confidence interv als for response rate should also be 
provided.
All patients who were enrolled on the trial should be included in the main analysis of the 
response rate. Thus, an incorrect treatm ent schedule or drug administrati on does not result 
in exclusion. However, if a patient is removed from treatm ent prior to their [ADDRESS_189516] of a treatment.
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurabl e when they are superf icial (e.g., skin

367.0 ADVERSE  EVENT S
This study will be conducte d in compliance with the Data Safety Monitor ing Plan (DSMP) of the
Robe rt  H. Lurie Comprehen sive Cancer Center of North western Universit y
 (http:// cancer.no rthweste rn.edu/CRO /data/DataandSa fetyMonito ringP lanMay2014.pd f). The level 
of risk at tributed to this study requires high-int ensit y monitor ing as outlined in the DSMP.
7.1   Ad verse Event Monitor ing
Adver se event data collecti on and reporti ng, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents . Adverse events are report ed in a routine 
manner at scheduled times during a trial (see Section 5 for timepoints ). In addit ion, certain 
adverse events  must be reporte d in an expedite d manner to allow for opti mal monitor ing 
and pat ient safety and care.
All patients experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug, 
will be followed until:
 the ad verse event resolves or the sympto ms or signs that const itute the adverse 
event return to baseline;
 a ny abnormal laborator y values have returned to baseline;
 th ere is a satisfactory explanati on other than the study drug for the changes 
observed; or
 d eath.
7.2   Defini tions & Descript ions
7.2.1 Ad verse Event
An ad verse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a pat ient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can theref ore be any unfavorable and unint ended sign 
(including an abnormal laborator y finding), sympto m, or disease temporally 
associate d with the use of an experimental interventi on, wheth er or not relate d to 
the interventi on.
Record ing of AEs should be done in a concise manner using standard,  
accepta ble medical terms. In general, AEs are not procedures or measurement s, 
but should reflect the reason for the procedure or the diagnosis based on the 
abnormal measurement. Preexisti ng condit ions that worsen in severit y or 
frequency during the study should also be recorded (a preexisti ng condit ion that 
does not worsen is not an AE ). Further, a procedure or surgery is not an AE ; 
rather, the event leading to the procedure or surgery is considered an AE.
If a sp ecific medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome 
should  be recorded as the AE whenever possible. However, a complete 
descripti on of the signs, sympto ms and investi gations which led to the diagnosis 
should be provided.  For example, if clinically signif icant elevati ons of liver 
function tests are known to be secondary to hepati tis, “hepati tis” and not 
“elevate d liver functi on tests” should be recorded. If the cause is not  known, the 
abnormal test or finding should be recorded as an AE, using appropri ate medical 
terminology (e/g/ throm bocytopenia, peripheral edema, QT prolongati on).
7.2.2 Se verity of AEs
All non-hemat ologic adverse events will be graded according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The 
CTCAE v4.03  is available at  http://ctep.cancer.g ov/reporti ng/ctc.html
If no CTCAE grading is available,  the severit y of an AE is graded as follows:
IRB #: STU00200112 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 9/2/2020 through 8/16/2021.
Amendment-  13            Version Date:06-26-2020
37 M ild (grade 1): the event causes discomf ort witho ut disrupt ion of normal daily 
activities.
 M oderate (grade 2): the event causes discomf ort that affects normal daily 
activities.
 Severe (gr ade 3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily 
activities or signif icantl y affects his/h er clinical status.
 L ife-threat ening (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.
 Fatal  (grade 5): the event caused death.
7.2.3 Se rious Adverse Events (SAEs)
All SAEs, regard less of attribution, occurring from ti me of signed informed 
consent, through [ADDRESS_189522] medical occurrence 
that:
 Resul ts  in death.
If death  results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.
 Is  life-th reaten ing.
The patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to 
an event  that hypoth etically might have caused death  if it were more severe.
 Req uires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163189] n of existin g 
hospit alizatio n for ≥ 24 hours.
 Resul ts  in persistent or si gnifica nt disabil ity or incapacity .
 Is  a congenit al anomaly /birth defect.
 Is  an important medi cal event .
Any event that does not meet  the above criteria, but that in the judgment of 
the investi gator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for report ing as a 
serious adverse event . The event may require medical or surgical
interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious
Adver se Event“.
For e xample:  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatm ent in an 
emergenc y room or at home; convulsions that may not result in 
hospit alizati on; development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
7.2.4 U nanticipated Prob lems Involving Risk s to Subjec t or Others
A UPIR SO is a type of SAE that includes events that meet ALL of the following 
criteri a:
 Is  unanti cipate d in terms of nature, severit y, or frequency
 Pla ces the research subject or others at a diff erent or greate r risk of harm
 Is  deemed to be at least possibly relate d to participat ion in the study.
7.3   Ad verse Event Reporting
7.3.1 R outine Repo rting

8.1.8 Inc om patibilities: As with other myelosuppressive cytotoxic agents,  great er 
myelosuppression is likely to be seen when topotecan is used in combinati on 
with other cytotoxic agents (e.g. paclit axel or etoposide) thereby [CONTACT_163239]. However, in combining with platinum agents (e.g. cisplat in or 
carbopl atin), there is a distinct sequence-dependent interac tion depending on 
whet her the platinum agent  is given on day [ADDRESS_189528] be given compared to the doses which can be given if the platinum 
agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing. When topotecan (0.75 
mg/m2/d ay for 5 consecutive days) and cisplati n (60 mg/m2/d ay on Day 1) were 
administ ered intravenously in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, mean topotecan 
plasma clearance on Day 5 was slight ly reduced compared to values on Day 1. 
As a result, systemic exposure of total topotecan, as measured by [CONTACT_163240], on Day 5 were increased by 12% (95% CI; 2%, 24%) and 23% (95% CI;
—7%, 63% ), respect ively. No pharmacokineti c data are available following 
topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/d ay for 3 consecut ive days) and cisplati n (50 mg/m 2/day 
on Day 1) in patients with cervical cancer.
When oral  topotecan was combined with cisplat in in a randomized Phase 3 study 
in chemoth erapy-naïve, extensive disease,  small cell lung cancer patients, the 
regimen of oral topotecan (1.7 mg/m2/d for 5 days) with i.v. cisplat in (60 mg/m2 
on day 5) was selected .
Topotecan is a substra te for both ABCG2 (BCRP) and ABCB1 (P-glycoprote in). 
Inhibitors of AB CB1 and ABCG2 (eg. elacridar) administered with oral topotec an 
increased topotecan exposure. The effect of elacridar on the pharmacokineti cs of 
intravenous topotecan was much less than the effect on oral topote can 
Cyclosporin A (an inhibitor  of ABCB1, ABCC1 [MRP -1], and CYP3A4) with oral 
topotecan increased topote can AUC.
Patie nts should be caref ully monitored for adverse events when oral topotecan is 
administered with a drug known to inhibit ABCG2 or ABCB1
The pharmacokineti cs of topoteca n after oral administr ation were generally
Unch anged when coadministered  with ranitidine.

Oral ( by [CONTACT_1966])
8.2.8 Inc om patibilities: Refer to Appendix A1 for a list of general drugs that should be 
avoided with pazopanib.
In vitro  studies suggested that the oxidat ive meta bolism of pazopanib in human 
liver microsomes  is mediated primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4, with minor contr ibutions 
from CY P1A2 and CYP2C8. Theref ore, inhibitors  and inducers of CYP3A4 may 
alter the meta bolism of pazopanib.
Agents  that may Increase pazopanib Blood Concentrat ions
CYP3 A4 Inhibit ors: Co-administrati on of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of the 
CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  clarit hromycin, atazanavir, 
indinavir, nefazodone,  nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithro mycin, voriconazole) 
may increase pazopanib concentra tions. Grapefruit juice may also increase 
plasma concentrati ons of pazopanib. Administrati on of 1500 mg lapat inib a 
substrate and weak inhibito r of CYP3A4, Pgp and BCRP with 800 mg pazopanib 
resulted in an approximate ly 50 % to 60 % increase in mean pazopanib AUC(0-
24) and Cmax compared to administrati on of [ADDRESS_189530] be coadministered with stron g CYP3A4 inhibitors  (see
Dosa ge and Administrati on).
Agents  that may Decrease pazopanib Blood Concentrati ons
CYP3 A4 Inducers: CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease plasma 
pazopanib concentrat ions. Selecti on of an alternat e concomitan t medicati on with 
no or minimal enzyme inducti on potential is recommended.
Effects of Pazopanib on CYP Substrat es

Effect of proton  pump inhibitors and gastri c pH on Pazopanib
Administrat ion  of pazopanib with a proto n pump inhibit or (PPI) results  in a 40% 
reducti on in AUC and time to Cmax of pazopanib. Theref ore, proto n pump 
inhibitors should be avoided with pazopanib. Drugs that raise gastri c pH should 
also be avoided.  If such drugs are needed, short acting antac ids should be 
considered in place of PP Is and H2 recepto r antagonists . Separate antacid and

9.0 COR RELATIVES/S PECIAL STUDIES
For Cohort  1 and 3:
Cell-free circulating  tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be analyzed using the CAPP-Seq method [1,2], a 
targeted hybrid capture-based NGS method, or the commercial version of CAPP-Seq called 
AVENIO [3]. Hybrid capture-based NGS was recently developed to improve the detection of 
multiple cancer mutations with high sensitivity and without significant prior knowledge of the 
alterations [4–6]. In this “hybrid capture” approach, relevant DNA sequences are hybridized to 
biotinylated probes [1]. Biotin is bound to streptavidin beads and then unbound DNA is washed 
away to “pull down” the bait DNA for NGS analysis [1]. Using this principle, Newman and Bratman 
et al. implemented an ultrasensitive ctDNA detection technique called Cancer Personalized 
Profiling by [CONTACT_115125] (CAPP-Seq) [1]. Recurrently mutated genomic regions in the 
population of a given cancer type are identified through bioinformatic analysis of cancer WES 
and/or WGS data from databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Catalog of 
Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) [1]. Biotinylated probes are designed against these 
recurrently mutated regions, and are referred to collectively as the “Selector” [1]. The “Selector” is 
applied to cell-free DNA from cancer patients, which is followed by [CONTACT_163245] a detection limit of ~0.01% [1,5]. The detection limit was significantly improved to 
~0.001% when a NGS error-correction strategy called integrative digital error suppression (IDES) 
was implemented [2]. This strategy utilized UMIs to reduce the effect of PCR errors and a 
bioinformatic error correction step called “polishing” to reduce the effect of stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_163194] [2].
For this  project, we will be applying CAPP-Seq to blood and tissue as we have done previously 
[1,2,7], by [CONTACT_163246] ~10 mL of plasma, inputting ~32 ng into the CAPP-Seq library 
preparation protocol which starts with adapter ligation, performing PCR, then targeted hybrid 
capture, and then NGS on a NovaSeq, HiSeq4000 or a NextSeq. We then will analyze the results 
using the CAPP-Seq or AVENIO bioinformatics pi[INVESTIGATOR_163195]-calling and 
calculation of variant allele fractions (VAFs) which are averaged at each time point to yield the 
mean VAF. We will use this measure, as well as the ctDNA concentration (VAF x cfDNA 
concentration) to quantify ctDNA at each time point, and correlate these results with demographic, 
diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data. 
For Cohort  2:
Sleijf er  et al. recent ly published a translat ional study in which they evaluated whet her cytok ine 
levels in the patients enrolled in EORTC [ZIP_CODE], the phase II study of pazopanib in soft tissue 
sarcoma, correlat ed with PFR and OS. They measured levels of several cytok ines at baseline 
and 12 weeks after beginning pazopanib therapy and demonstrate d that baseline levels were not 
predi ctive, but that high sVEGFR2 and low PI[INVESTIGATOR_163196] d with a more favorable PFR at
12 wee ks (OR 0.636, 95% CI 0.413-0. 977, P=0.039) and (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.007-1.1 60, 
P=0.0318) respecti vely. There was also a trend toward high sVEGFR2 at week 12 and increased 
OS and a statistically signif icant associat ion between low PI[INVESTIGATOR_163197] 12 and longer OS 
(HR 1.061, 95% CI 1. 025-1.09 9, P=0.0009) 6.

CLASSIFI CATION
The New  York Heart Asso ciation (NYHA) Functional Classification provides a 
simple way of classif ying the extent of  heart  failure. It places patients in one of four 
categories  based on how much they are limit ed durin g physical activ ity; the
limitati ons/sy mptoms are in regards to normal breath ing and varying degrees in
short n ess of breat h and or angina pain:
Function al Capacit y Objective Assess ment
Class I. Patients with cardiac disease but without 
result ing limitation of physical acti vity. Ordinary physical 
activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpit ation, 
dyspnea or anginal pain.No  object ive evidence 
of cardiovascular 
disease
Class II. Patients with cardiac disease result ing in slight 
limitation of physical act ivity. They are comf ortable at 
rest. Ordinary physical activ ity result s in fatigue, 
palpit ation, dyspnea or anginal pain.Objective evidence of 
minimal 
cardiovascular 
disease
Class III. Patients with cardiac disease result ing in 
marked limitation of physical activ ity. They are 
comf ortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes 
fatigue, palpit ation, dyspnea or anginal pain.Objective evidence of 
moderat ely severe 
cardiovascular 
disease
Class IV. Patients with cardiac disease result ing in 
inabilit y to carry on any physical activi ty without 
discomf ort. Sympt oms of heart failure or the anginal 
syndrome may be present even at  rest.  If any physical 
activity is undert aken, discomf ort increases.Objective evidence of 
severe cardiovascular

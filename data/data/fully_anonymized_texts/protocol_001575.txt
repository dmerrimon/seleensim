subjects who have completed the 6 -week treatment period in the preceding s tudies , D1050301 , 
D1050325, or D1050326.   
Subjects who complete participation in the preceding s tudies , D1050301 , D1050325, or D1050326  will 
be eligible for enrollment in this study. Informed consent/assent will be obtained from all subjects 
(where developmentally appropriate) before any study procedures are performed. Subjects who meet 
entry criteria will transition to this study directly from Study D1050301, D1050325, or D1050326. All subjects will be treated with flexibly dosed lurasidone during the trial.  
A reliable informant (eg, parent, legal guardian, or caregiver) of the subject must  accompany the 
subject at each visit.  For subjects entering from Study D1050325, the reliable car egiver will also 
oversee the administration of the study drug throughout the study.  
All eligible subjects will be treated with lurasidone 40 mg/day for Days 1 -7. Beginning with Day 8, 
dose adjustments (20, 40, 60 or 80 mg/day) will be permitted, based on i nvestigator judgment, to 
optimize tolerability and effectiveness.  
Dose adjustment of study drug should occur at the regularly scheduled visits and in increments or decrements of 1 dose level. However, dose reductions for tolerability or safety purposes may occur beginning on Day 2, based on investigator judgment. These dose reductions may be between study visits and at more than 1 dose level at a time (maximum of 2 dose levels at a time). If dose reductions 
are required between regular study visits, the subject must return to the study site for an unscheduled 
visit to receive new medication kits and return all used/unused medication kits at the time of dose adjustment.  
Safety and effectiveness assessments will be conducted at scheduled visits during the stu dy. 
A follow -up visit will occur [ADDRESS_259940] (DSMB) will review safety and clinical outcome data including 
data on adverse events ( AEs) and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) at regular intervals until the 
D1050301, D1050325, and D1050326 studies are  complete and as long as necessary for the D1050302 
study, as determined by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor . The DSMB will be independent of the Sponsor, contract research 
organization (CRO), and the investigators and will be empowered to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_216322], but not for efficacy or futility. The membership of the DSMB and its mandate is 
denoted in the DSMB charter. 
Number of Subjects (planned): T he estimated number of subjects eligible for enrollment is 
approximately 702 subjects.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:

There has been 1 completed pediatric clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of lurasidone in adolescents (12-17 years of age) and children (6 -11 years of age)  with schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar spectrum, autistic 
spect rum disorder, or other psychiatric disorders (Study D1050300). 
Preliminary results from this study revealed that exposure in the pediatric population (6-17 years of age) are similar to observed exposure in adults across the dose range (20-160 mg). The most 
frequently observed AEs (≥10%) across the dose range in this population were somnolence 
(42%), sedation (18%), nausea (17%), and vomiting (15%). 
4.2. Study Rationale  
Lurasidone is a novel compound being developed by [CONTACT_29998], and is an approved agent for the treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia. Lurasidone has a unique chemical structure that differs from conventional and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_146583]. Lurasidone is 
a novel compound with high affinities for dopamine D
2, serotonin 5- HT 2A and 5- HT 7 receptors, 
moderate affinity for serotonin 5- HT 1A and noradrenaline α 2C and α 2A receptors, and little or no 
affinity for histamine H 1 and muscarinic M 1 receptors which are thought to be responsible for 
some important side effects (weight gain, sedation) and worsening of the cognitive function. 
Clinical studies in adults with schizophrenia treated with lurasidone have shown significant beneficial effects on the amelioration of positive and negative symptoms with a minimal effect 
on weight gai n, glucose metabolism, and lipid parameters.  
Based on its pharmacologic profile as well as clinical studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia 
and bipolar depression, lurasidone is expected to be associated with few extrapyramidal 
symptoms (EPS) and to be effective in ameliorating a broad range of symptoms in adolescents 
with schizophrenia, autistic disorder, and bipolar depression. 
This open-label extension study is designed to evaluate the longer- term safety, tolerability, and 
effectiveness of lurasidone over [ADDRESS_259948] completed a previous lurasidone study. The 104-week study duration will provide an adequate timeframe within which to evaluate the longer- term effects of lurasidone in this patient 
population. 
4.3. Dose Justification  
Based on the therapeutic dose ranges evaluated in prior lurasidone clinical studies, doses of 
20, 40, 60 or 80 mg/day will be used in this study. Lurasidone will be taken with food for 
optimal exposure to the administered dose. The dose of lurasidone may be adjusted to optimize efficacy and tolerability, as deemed clinically appropriate.

7.1. Overall Study Design 
This is an open -label, 104 -week, multicenter, extension study designed to evaluate the long- term 
safety , tolerability and effectiveness of flexibly dosed lurasidone (20, 40, 60 or 80 mg/day) in 
pediatric subjects who have completed a 6- week treatment period in one of the preceding studies, 
D1050301, D1050325, or D1050326.   
Subjects who complete participation in one of the preceding studies, D1050301, D1050325 or 
D1050326, will be eligible for enrollment in this study. Informed consent/assent will be obtained 
from all subjects (where developmentally appropriate) before any study procedures are 
performed. Subjects who meet entry criteria will transition to this study directly from Study 
D1050301, D1050325 or D1050326. All subjects will be treated with flexibly dosed lurasidone 
during the trial.  
A reliable informant (eg, parent,  legal guardian, or caregiver) of the subject must  accompany the 
subject at each visit.  For subjects entering from Study D1050325, the reliable caregiver will also 
oversee the administration of the study drug throughout the study. 
All eligible subjects wil l be treated with lurasidone 40 mg/day for Days 1-7. Beginning with 
Day 8, dose adjustments (20, 40, 60 or 80 mg/day) will be permitted, based on investigator 
judgment, to optimize tolerability and effectiveness.  Dose adjustment of study drug should occur at the regularly scheduled visits and in increments 
or decrements of 1 dose level. However, dose reductions for tolerability or safety purposes may 
occur beginning on Day 2, based on investigator judgment. These dose reductions may be 
between study visits and at more than 1 dose level at a time (maximum of 2 dose levels at a time). If dose reductions are required between regular study visits, the subject must return to the 
study site for an unscheduled visit to receive new medication kits and return all used/unused 
medication kits at the time of dose adjustment.   
Safety and effectiveness assessments will be conducted at sched uled visits during the study. 
A follow-up visit will occur [ADDRESS_259949] research organization (CRO), and the investigators and will be empowered to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_29921], but not for efficacy or 
futility. The membership of the DSMB and its mandate is denoted in the DSMB charter.

effective method of birth control (eg, male using condom and female using condom, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge, spermicide, contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], or intrauterine device) 
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.[ADDRESS_259957] be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF ). The entry must include the dose, regimen, route, indication, and dates of use. 
Potent inducers or inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme system ( Appendix B ) and any medications 
that consistently prolong the QTc interval are prohibited. In addition, the use of herbal supplements (for psychotropic reasons, eg, Gingko Biloba, Kava Kava, St. John’s Wort, etc.) or 
other complementary or alternative medications except melatonin during the study are not 
permitted.  
Initiation of new non-pharmacologic therapy (eg, a new course of psychotherapy or behavior modification) is permitted during  the study. Subjects who have participated in ongoing 
psychotherapy or other non-pharmacological treatment during Study D1050301, D1050325, or 
D1050326 will be permitted to continue this treatment during the study.  
9.1.1. Concomitant Non -psychotropic Medications 
Non-psychotropic medications may be used to treat mild, chronic medical conditions if the dose 
and regimen have been stable (± 25%) during Study D1050301, D1050325, or D1050326. β-adrenergic antagonists used to treat stable hypertension can be continued throughout the study. 
In addition, use of non-prescription pain medications (eg, acetaminophen or ibuprofen ) are 
allowed provided these medications do not have a propensity for psychotropic effects and do not interfere with the evaluation of study drug. Medications for short- term treatment of a medical 
condition (no more than 14 days) are allowed provided that the medications are not CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers and do not consistently prolong the QTc interval. 
9.1.2. Concomitant Psychotropic Medications  
Subjects may  be treated with any approved benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_216323]3A4 inhibitors/inducers  (Appendix B ), during the course of the 
study, at the discretion of the investigator in a manner consistent with labeling recommendations 
and conventional medical practice. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and additional antipsychotic medications (with the exception of lurasidone) will be prohibited.  
Treatment with stimulants (provided that the medications are not potent CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers), guanfacine or atomoxetine will be permitted during the course of the study for treatment of attentional deficits, at the discretion of the investigator in a manner consistent with labeling recommendations and conventional medical practice. 
Treatment with benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (≤  6 mg/day) will be permitted as needed for movement disorders. In 
cases where benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_216324], or a subject has had an inadequate response or 
intolerability to benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_99646], the following medications may be used to treat acute EPS: biperiden (≤  16 mg/day) or trihexyphenidyl ( ≤ 15 mg/day) or diphenhydramine 
(≤ 100 mg/day for subjects entering from Study D1050301 or Study D1050326; ≤  50 mg/day for 
subjects entering from Study D1050325). Treatment with propranolol (≤  120 mg/day) will be 
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.0  Lurasidone 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  36 30 Jun 2017 permitted as needed for akathisia. Medications used to treat movement disorders should not be 
given prophylactically. 
Concomitant use of lorazepam, or equivalent benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], is permitted at the discretion of the 
investigator ( ≤ 6 mg/day or equivalent dose ) for intolerable anxiety/agitat ion, as clinically 
indicated. In regions where lorazepam or other specified medications are not available, another similar agent at equivalent doses will be permitted as specified by [CONTACT_67806]/or the Operations Manual. Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_216325] a rapid acting IM injection 
should be used sparingly, and only when clinically required per investigator judgment. The date and time of last dose of lorazepam (or equivalent benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) must be recorded at each visit. Subjects should be encouraged to avoid taking these medications within 8 hours prior to scheduled study assessments.  
Temazepam (≤ 30 mg/day), eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] (≤ 3 mg/day), zaleplon (≤ 20mg/day), zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] (≤ 10 mg/day for males; ≤  5 mg/day for females), zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_216326] (≤  12.5 mg /day for males; 
≤ 6.25 mg/day for females), diphenhydramine (≤  100 mg/day for subjects entering from Study 
D1050301 or D1050326; ≤  50 mg/day for subjects entering from Study D1050325), melatonin 
(≤ 5 mg/day), or clonidine immediate release (≤ 0.1 mg/day) may be administered at bedtime for 
insomnia, as needed. For those subjects taking melatonin, over the counter melatonin should be used; combination melatonin products are not allowed. Sedative-hypnotic agents should be administered no more than once nightly and should not be used in combination. 
Since the list of prohibited potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers ( Appendix B ) is not 
comprehensive, inve stigators should use medical judgment when a subject presents with a 
medication not on the list or consult with the Medical Monitor for clarification.  
9.2. Treatment Compliance 
All subjects and caregivers will be reminded at each study visit of the importance of strict 
compliance with taking study medication as directed,  with food. Compliance with study 
medication must be monitored closely at each visit. Subjects will be instructed to bring all 
unused study medication with them to each visit. Subjects missing more than 25% or taking more than 125% of scheduled doses between visits must be immediately reported to and 
discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
9.3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216327] (either D1050301 or D1050326) can continue to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216328] [ADDRESS_259958] to determine the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216329]/her clinical judgment. After these initial [ADDRESS_259959] discontinues and is clinically unstable, additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (beyond the original 
14 days allowed) may be allowed on a case -by-case basis with pre-approval of the Medical 
Monitor. 
For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26328], they must be clinically stable, in the judgment of the investigator, to 
warrant discharge to the appropriate living environment. In making a discharge determination, 
investigators should also consider the following additional factors: appropri ateness for outpatient

Protocol D1050302 Version 4.[ADDRESS_259962] (ABC): The ABC is a symptom checklist for assessing problem 
behaviors of children and adults with intellectual disability and developmental disorders at home, 
in residential facilities, intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disability , and 
work training center. It is also useful for classifying problem behaviors of these children and adolescent in educational settings, residential and community- based facilities, and developmental 
centers. The 58 items resolve into five subscales: (1) irritability and agitation, (2) lethargy and 
social withdrawal, (3) stereotypic behavior, (4) hyperactivity and noncompliance, and 
(5) inappropriate speech. The ABC irritability subscale contains 15 items that rate symptoms such as “injures self”, “aggressive to other children and adults”, “irritable”, “temper  outbursts”, 
“depressed mood”, “mood changes”, and “yells or screams inappropriately” on a scale ranging 
from 0 (not at all a problem) to 3 (severe).  The checklist is completed by [CONTACT_423]’s 
parent/caregiver and the same parent/caregiver should complete all ABC assessments for a given 
subject whenever possible. The ABC- C (community) version will be used.  
Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale (CGI- S): The CGI -S is a c linician -rated 
assessment of the subject’s current illness state on a 7 point scale, where a higher score is associated with greater illness severity  (eg, schizophrenia or irritability associated with autism). 
Following a clinical interview, the CGI- S can be completed in 1-2 minutes ( Guy 1976; Williams 
2000). The CGI -S will be administered by a qualified rater at the site and the same study site 
rater should perform all CGI- S assessments for a given subject whenever possible.  
Children's Yale -Brown Obsessive  Compulsive Scales (CY -BOCS) modified for pervasive 
developmental disorders (PDDs): The Children's Yale- Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 
(CY-BOCS) modified for pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) ( Scahill, 2006) is a 
clinical -administered semistructur ed clinician rating that measures to measure the severity of 
obsessive -compulsive disorder. The modification for PDDs eliminates the obsessions checklist 
and severity scales of the CY -BOCS, while expanding the compulsions checklist to include 
repetitive behaviors more commonly seen in children with PDD. In addition, the modified for 
PDDs version relies more on parental input than on the child's input. The CY-BOCS  will be 
administered by a qualified rater at the site and the same study site rater should perf orm all CY -
BOCS assessments for a given subject whenever possible.  
Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS): The CGAS is a clinician -rated assessment of the 
overall severity of disturbance in children, with a range of scores from [ADDRESS_259963] conducted a standardized 
diagnostic assessment of the child (usually in community surveys), was constructed similarly, 
except that the descriptors of psychopathology and functioning are written in lay terminology. The single numerical score representing severity of disturbance ranges from 1 (most impaired) to 
100 (healthiest). On the basis of the descr iptors, raters are expected to synthesize their 
knowledge about the child’s social and symptomatic functioning and condense this information 
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.0  Lurasidone 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  42 30 Jun 2017 into a score. For example, a score of 61–70 indicates that the child has some difficulty in a single 
area but is generally functioning pretty well. Scores above 70 are considered to be in the normal 
range, whereas scores on the low end of the continuum indicate a need for constant supervision 
(1–10) or considerable supervision (11–20). The CGAS will be administered by a qualified rater 
at the site and the same study site rater should perform all CGAS assessments for a given subject 
whenever possible.  
Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CGSQ): The CGSQ is a caregiver reported assessment that 
assesses the extent to which caregivers are affected by [CONTACT_216360] a child with emotional and behavioral problems. The CGSQ is comprised of three 
subscales which range in severity  from 1 to 5. Objective Strain refers to observable disruptions in 
family and community life (eg, interruption of personal time, lost work time, financial strain). 
Subjective Externalized Strain refers to negative feelings about the child such as anger, 
resentment, or embarrassment. Subjective Internalized Strain refers to the negative feelings that the caregiver experiences such as worry, guilt, or fatigue. Higher scores on each of these scales 
indicate greater strain. A Global Strain score is calculated by [CONTACT_216361] (ie, 
Objective Strain, Subjective Externalized Strain, and Subjective Internalized Strain) to provide an indication of the total impact of the special demands on the family. Global Strain scores range 
from 3 to 15. As with the individual subscales, higher scores indicate greater strain.  
Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ- LES -Q): The 
Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ -LES- Q) is a 15 -item 
measure that assesse s the quality of life in children and adolescents. This scale focuses on the 
child’s or adolescent’s views about general health, well -being, and feelings about the medical 
condition. Response categories range from “very poor” to “very good”. The PQ -LES- Q is a 
subject self -reported assessment.  
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS): The PANSS is an interview -based measure 
of the severity of psychopathology in adults with psychotic disorders. The measure is comprised of 30 items and 3 scales: the Positive scale assesses hallucinations, delusions, and related 
symptoms; the Negative scale assesses emotional withdrawal, lack of motivation, and similar symptoms; and the General Psychopathology scale addresses other symptoms such as anxiety, 
somatic concern, and disorientation. An anchored Likert scale from 1-7, where values of 2 and 
above indicate the presence of progressively more severe symptoms, is used to score each item. Individual items are then summed to determine scores for the 3 scales, as well as a total score. A 
Composite scale score (Positive scale score minus Negative scale score) can also be calculated to 
show the relative valence of positive and negative symptoms. Total time required for the PANSS interview and scoring is approximately 30-40 minutes ( Kay, 1994; Perkins, 2000; Opler, 1992). 
PANSS raters will be required to meet specific training and education criteria before they are certified to rate for this study. In addition, raters will receive specific training and education regarding all of the assessments prior to study initiation. The PANSS will be administered by a 
qualified rater at the site and the same study site rater should perform all PANSS assessments for 
a given subject whenever possible.  
Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS -R): The CDRS -R is a semi -structured, 
clinician -rated instrument designed for use with children and adolescents between the ages of 
6-[ADDRESS_259964] 
whenever possible.  
Clinical Global Impression -Bipolar Version, Severity of Illness (CGI- BP-S): The CGI -BP-S 
is a three -part clinician -rated assessment of the subject’s current illness state (depression, mania, 
and overall) using a 7- point scale for each part, where a higher score is associated with greater 
illness severity. Following a clinical interview, the CGI- BP-S can be completed in [ADDRESS_259965] whenever possible. 
Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS):  The PARS is a clinician -rated instrument for 
assessing over time the severity of anxiety symptoms associated with common DSM-IV anxiety 
disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety, and social phobia) in children ages 
6-[ADDRESS_259966] the severity/impairment of all symptoms endorsed in Se ction 1 of the PARS (during 
the past week). The PARS will be administered by a qualified rater at the site and  the same study 
site rater should perform all PARS assessments for a given subject whenever possible.  
Attention -Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD -RS):  The ADHD- RS IV was 
developed to measure the behaviors of children with ADHD. The ADHD- RS IV is a validated 
scale that consists of [ADDRESS_259967] current symptomatology of ADHD based on DSM -IV-TR criteria. Each item is scored from a range of zero (reflecting no symptoms) to three 
(reflecting severe symptoms) with total scores ranging from zero to 54. The 18 items may be 
grouped into two sub-scales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even number items 2 through 18) and 
inattentiv eness (odd number items 1 through 17). The ADHD- RS will be administered to the 
caregiver by a qualified rater at the site and the same study site rater should perform all ADHD -
RS assessments for a given subject whenever possible.

performance of an ECG.  
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.0  Lurasidone 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  44 30 Jun 2017 Orthostatic effects: Orthostatic changes with clinically significant symptoms should be 
recorded as AEs. The categorization of orthostatic effects is intended for the data analysis and 
reporting of group effects and does not constitute guidance as to whether individual assessments 
reflect  clinically meaningful changes. 
Physical Examination Assessments: A full physical examination will be performed. The 
physical examination i ncludes an assessment of general appearance and a review of systems 
(dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, extremities, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric 
systems).  
Weight, height, and waist circumference:  Weight and height should be measured in street 
clothing with no shoes. Waist circumference measurement should be taken around the body at 
the level of the abdomen and just above the hip bone. The waist circumference measurement is usually taken immediately after exhalation.  
Centrally -read ECG: All ECGs will be obtained in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], after the subject has 
been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 10 minutes. ECGs will be 12- lead with a 10 -second rhythm strip. 
ECGs should be obtained prior to drawing blood samples. All attempts should be made to use the 
same ECG recorder for all visits within individual subjects. ECGs will be centrally read at a core lab according to established quality assurance procedures for  inter/intra reader variability.  
Clinical Laboratory: For detailed instructions regarding laboratory procedures, sampling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_29915]. Samples will be processed at a central laboratory to en sure consistency. All laboratories will be College of 
American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) (or equivalent) certified. See Appendix A  for a list of required clinical laboratory tests.  
Hyperglycemia will be defined as any glucose result of ≥ 126 mg/dL; dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_216333] ≥ 240 mg/dL or triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dL. 
Adverse Events: As a discussion guide, subjects should be queried in a non- leading manner, 
without specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since your last 
visit?”). See  Appendix C .  
Concomitant Medications and Medical History:  Subject and caregiver self -report will be 
acceptable for listing all concomitant medication use, medical history, psychiatric history, and evalu ation for inclusion/exclusion except where specific protocol procedures are mandated to 
ensure appropriate enrollment (eg, certain baseline lab values). 
Simpson- Angus Scale (SAS): The SAS is a clinician -rated assessment of neuroleptic -induced 
parkinsonism consisting of 10 items. Items are anchor -based, rated on a 5-point scale, and 
address rigidity, gait (bradykinesia), tremor, glabellar tap, and salivation (Simpson, 1970). SAS 
raters will be required to meet specific credential and educational criteria bef ore they are 
certified to rate for this study. The same study site rater should perform all SAS assessments for a given subject whenever possible.  
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS): The BARS ( Barnes, 1989, Barnes, 2003, 
Schooler, 2000) is a rating scale geared toward assessment of neuroleptic -induced akathisia, 
though it can be used to measure akathisia associated with other drugs as well. The BARS consists of 4 items, including one item assessing objective restlessness, 2 items targeting 
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.0  Lurasidone 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  45 30 Jun 2017 subjective restlessness (awareness and related distress), and one global clinical assessment item. 
All items are anchored and utilize a 4 -point scale, except for the global rating which has a 6-
point scale (from absence of akathisia through severe akat hisia). The subjective and objective 
items are summed to yield a total score. The BARS can be administered in about [ADDRESS_259970] whenever possible. 
Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS): The AIMS is a clinician -rated assessment of 
abnormal movements consisting of unobtrusive observation of the subject at rest (with shoes 
removed) and several questions or instructions directed toward the subject. Using a severity scale 
ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe), clinicians rate dyskinesia in several body regions, including the facial area, extremities, and trunk. There are [ADDRESS_259971]’s awareness of abnormal movements ( Guy, 1976; Munetz, 1988). AIMS raters will be required to meet 
specific credential and educational criteria before they are certified to  rate for this study. The 
same study site rater should perform all AIMS assessments for a given subject whenever possible. 
Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale ([LOCATION_006]U): The Udvalg for Kliniske 
Undersøgelser ([LOCATION_006]U) Side Effect Rating Scal e (Lingiaerde, 1987) is a comprehensive, clinician -
rated scale, designed to assess the side effects in patients treated with psychotropic medications. 
The [LOCATION_006]U contains information obtained via interviews with the patient, as well as observations 
made by [CONTACT_15370].  The [LOCATION_006]U consists of 48 questions. A rating can typi[INVESTIGATOR_216334] 30 minutes. Each point on the [LOCATION_006]U is assigned a degree of zero, one, two or three. 
Zero  indicates normal; one indicates mild symptoms; two indicates moderate symptoms; and 
three indicates severe symptoms.  The same study site rater should perform all [LOCATION_006]U assessments 
for a given subject whenever possible. 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS): The C -SSRS is a tool designed to 
systematically assess and track suic idal adverse events (suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) 
throughout the trial. The strength of this suicide classification system is in its ability to 
comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over- identification of suicidal 
behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to administer. The C- SSRS will be 
administered by a trained rater at the site. Subjects with Type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or Type 5 (active suicidal ideation with  specific plan 
and intent) suicidal ideation during the study will be discontinued from the study and referred to a mental health professional.  The same study site rater should perform all C -SSRS assessments 
for a given subject whenever possible. 
Young Man ia Rating Scale (YMRS): The YMRS is an 11 -item instrument used to assess the 
severity of mania in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The 11 items are: Elevated 
Mood, Increased Motor Activity Energy, Sexual Interest, Sleep, Irritability, Speech (Rate and 
Amount), Language-Thought Disorder, Content, Disruptive- Aggressive Behaviour, Appearance 
and Insight. The YMRS is a clinician -rated assessment and uses operationally -defined anchor 
points. Ratings are based on patient self -reporting, combined with clinician observation 
(accorded greater score). The YMRS will be administered separately to the subject and to the 
caregiver by a qualified rater at the site and the same study site rater should perform all YMRS assessments for a given subject whenever possible. 
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.[ADDRESS_259972] Battery: The CogState Computerized Cognitive Test 
Battery is a computerized testing platform designed to provide brief, standardized, and easily 
administered assessment of a range of cognitive functions. The CogState test battery to be used 
in this study consists of four tasks each designed to specifically assess functioning in the following cognitive domains: psychomotor speed (detection task); attention (identification task); 
learning/memory (one card learning task); and working memory (one back task). The 
computerized test will be administered to each subject using the computer interface at the study site. 
Tanner Staging: a scale of physical development in children, adolescents and adults. The scale defines physical measurements of d evelopment based on external primary and secondary sex 
characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitalia, testicular volume and development of 
pubic and axillary hair. 
Menstrual cyclicity (female subjects only): Menstrual cyclicity will be monito red in female 
subjects who have begun menses. Female subjects will be given a calendar to mark the beginning 
and end of each menses. This calendar will be reviewed at each visit.  
11.2. Standardization of Data Capture 
Study Schematic and Schedule of Assessments:  A schematic of the study design and summary 
of assessments to be conducted at each visit are presented in Figure 1 and Table  3, Table  4, and 
Table  5, respectively . 
Assessment Windows:  Assessments will be conducted within the time frames specified  
(ie ± 3 days) . All times are relative to the time of dosing for indiv idual subjects 
11.3. Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
The study sites will use a validated EDC system to enter subject data onto CRFs. Medidata RAVE  will be used for this clinical study. Password protected access to the EDC system will be 
via a secure website. Data queries and data corrections will be handled through the same system. 
All transactions within the EDC system are fully documented within an electronic audit trail. 
Each set of completed CRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_1275] .

CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS  AFTER STUDY MEDICATI ON 
DISCONTINUATION  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. 
12.1. Study Participation Termination Criteria 
The reason for early discontinuation from study participation is to be recorded as one of the 
following: 
• Adverse event (specify) 
• Lack of efficacy (specify)  
• Lost to foll ow-up (specify) 
• Other (specify) 
• Protocol violation (specify) 
• With drawal by [CONTACT_1130] (specify) 
Discontinuations due to an adverse event may include laboratory, vital signs, or other test 
abnormalities that result in early discontinuation. Please note that all AEs are to be recorded on 
the AE page. Serious adverse events that result in discontinuation or that result in death (an outcome resulting from an AE) are to be recorded on the AE page. The investigator or study 
coordinator must notify the Sponsor or Sponsor designee as soon as possible when a subject has 
been discontinued/withdrawn due to an AE (telephone or fax). 
Subjects whose study participation is prematurely terminated will not be replaced.  
12.2. Follow -up Procedures Upon Discontinuation/Withdrawal  
If a subject discontinues study medication treatment due to an AE, then the subject should be 
evaluated until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. When a subject 
discontinues/withdraws prior to study completion, all applicable activities scheduled for the final 
study visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation. A termination eCRF page should be completed for every subject who received study medication whether or not the subject 
completed the study. The reason for discontinuation should be indicated on the eCRF. Any AEs 
that are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accordance with 
the safety requirements outlined in Section  13. Subjects who discontinue from the study will not 
be replaced.  Subjects who discontinue from the study must be referred by [CONTACT_216363] -up care. 
For all subjects a follow -up visit will be scheduled for 7 (± 3) days after the last dose of study 
medication to monitor AEs and SAEs. If an in -person visit is not possible, telephone contact [CONTACT_216364].

Confidential and Proprietary  76 30 Jun 2017 13. ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING  
13.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any new, untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing 
medical condition that occurs during study participation, whether or not the event is considered drug related.  
AEs will be collected from the time the informed consent is signed to the end of the study. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected and reported on the SAE form, from the time of informed consent to [ADDRESS_259973] be recorded on 
the CRF and the data recorded should match that on the SAE form. 
Non-leading questions will be used to ask subjects about the possible occurrence of AEs. The 
investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_216365], must be documented in the subject’s study records/source 
documents, in accordance with the investigator ’s normal clinical practice, and on the AE page of 
the CRF. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the study medication. Appendix C  (Definitions for Reporting Adverse Events) provides 
definitions for severity of an adverse event, relationship to study medication, frequency, and 
action taken. An AE is deemed associated with the use of the study drug “if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]” (21 CFR 312.32 [a]).  
The Medical Monitor is the initial contact [CONTACT_29970].  The contact [CONTACT_216366] c ontact 
information can be found in Table [ADDRESS_259974] be recorded as 
AEs. Clinically significant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG 
value, and physical examination observation) will also be recorded on the Adverse Event page of 
the CRF from signing of the informed consent onwa rds. When a clear diagnosis is available that 
explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal 
objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recorded as the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a 
definite diagnosis is not available, then record the sign (eg, clinically significant elevation of 
transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdominal pain) as the AE.  
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_216367]. The 
invest igator must determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Possibly 
drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality must be repeated. Any 
abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the i nvestigator . Laboratory 
reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by a Form FDA 1572- listed investigator. 
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.[ADDRESS_259975] be immediately reported:  
• SAE, including death. 
• The incidence of pregnancy.  
The appropriate Pharmacovigilance ( PVG) group must be contact[CONTACT_216368]. 
Emergency contact [CONTACT_29972] 1  of this protocol. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening AE, in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form might have caused death.  
If an investigator or study site staff becomes aware of a SAE that occurs in a study subject from 
the time that informed consent is signed through [ADDRESS_259976] (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) by [CONTACT_216369]. 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she will be instructed to 
immediately stop taking study medication. Further, the subject will be instructed to return within 
[ADDRESS_259977] 
received any study medication, w ill be followed until resolution (ie, termination [voluntary or 
spontaneous] or birth).  
If a pregnancy is reported for the study subject’s partner, the Sponsor’s representative will 
provide instructions on how to collect pregnancy information in accordanc e with local 
requirements. Proper consent to collect the partner’s information will be obtained prior to the collection of any information. 
To report a pregnancy, the Pregnancy Event Form must be completed and sent via facsimile to 
PVG within [ADDRESS_259978] has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (eg, elective surgery) that was scheduled prior to the subject entering the study (ie, before the subject signed the informed consent form [ ICF]) for an event/condition that occurred before the study, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216335] a therapeutic intervention and not the result of an SAE. It should have been clearly documented prior to signing the ICF. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it must be reported as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). 
13.5. Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
A DSMB will review safety and clinical outcome data including data on AEs and SAEs at regular intervals  until the D1050301, D1050325, and D1050326 studies are complete and as long 
as necessary for the D1050302 study, as determined by [CONTACT_1034]. The DSMB will be 
independent of the Sponsor, CRO, and the investigators and will be empowered to recommend 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_29921], but not for efficacy or futility. The membership of the 
DSMB and its mandate is  denoted in the DSMB charter.

A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide details on the statistical methods planned for this 
study and will be finalized prior to the 1st interim data cut, which will happen when at least 
100 subjects continued from studies D1050301 and D1050325 complete the Week 28 Visit. 
14.1. Randomization and Blinding 
This is  an open-label study, therefore randomization and blinding will not be employed. 
14.2. Unbl inding Procedures  
This section is not applicable to this study. 
14.3. Hypotheses 
Because of the nature of an open -labeled study, no hypotheses are planned. 
14.4. Variables and Timepoints  
14.4.1. Primary Safety Variables  
The primary safety variables include treatment -emergent AEs and SAEs, and discontinuations 
due to AEs. 
14.4.2. Other Safety Variables  
Safety and tolerability will further be assessed by [CONTACT_66436]: laboratory values, 
ECGs, physical examinations, movement disorders (AIMS, BARS, and SAS scores), vital signs, 
height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, tanner staging, menstrual cyclicity (female subjects), and hormonal parameters. For subjects previously enrolled in the D1050301 and D1050326, 
safety will fu rther be assessed by [CONTACT_216370], C -SSRS, and [LOCATION_006]U. In 
addition, for subjects previously enrolled in study D1050326, Young Mania Rating Scale 
(YMRS) will be also assessed.

Confidential and Proprietary  83 30 Jun 2017 The primary analysis for the study is to assess the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations 
due to AEs. The terms used in the eCRFs by [CONTACT_216376] (MedDRA). All reported adverse 
events with onset on or after the first dose of study drug during the treatment phase (ie, treatment- emergent adverse events) will be included in the analysis.   
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_148548], having an AE by [CONTACT_6764], and having each individual AE. The incidence of an AE is determined by [CONTACT_216377], severity and/or 
relationship to study medications. AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_216378] (as assessed by [CONTACT_093]), and action taken. 
Special attention will be given to those subjects who discontinue treatment due to an adverse 
event, or who experienced a severe or a serious adverse event (eg,  summaries, listings, and 
narrative preparation may be provided, as appropriate).  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the all other safety variables or tests and the corresponding changes from baseline (including double-blind study baseline and open- label 
study baseline) by [CONTACT_96013]. N otable values will be flagged, and any other information 
collected will be listed as appropriate. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum values). Categorical variables will be reported as frequencies and percentages. For weight, height, and BMI, descriptive statistics will be also summarized for the age- adjusted 
standardized scores.  
For subjects continued from study D1050301 and D1050326, descriptive statistics will be provided for Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale ([LOCATION_006]U) and the 
age-adjusted standardized CogState composite score.  For C -SSRS, number and percentage of

from an IRB or IEC complying with the provisions specified in [ADDRESS_259985] assure IRB 
or IEC compliance with the applicable regulations.  
A copy of written IRB or IEC approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_29925], informed consent form and advertising (if applicable) must be provided to CRO/Sponsor prior to initiation of the 
study. The approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_216337], identify the IRB/IEC name [CONTACT_3816], identify the clinical protocol by [CONTACT_29985]/or protocol number, and include the date that approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_11744]. The letter 
must also contain a statement that the IRB or IEC complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 
Part 56 for a study conducted under an IND or ICH GCP, as applicable. 
The investigator /CRO is responsible for obtaining continued review of the clinical research or 
submitting periodic progress reports, in accordance with applicable regulations, at intervals not 
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.[ADDRESS_259986] promptly inform their IRB/IEC of all SAEs or other safety information 
reported from CRO/Sponsor in accordance with 21 CFR 312.66, or when dictated by [CONTACT_13762] (ie, Directive 2001/20/EC), the Sponsor/CRO is responsible for reporting to the 
IEC (eg, reporting of serious AEs). 
16.3. Informed Consent 
The investigator will prepare the informed consent form and provide the form to CRO/Sponsor for approval prior to submission to the IRB or IEC. CRO/Sponsor may provide a template 
informed consent form to be qualified by [CONTACT_29988]. All informed consent forms must contain the minimum elements as mandated by [CONTACT_216380]/Sponsor approval 
as well as IRB or IEC approval. CRO/Sponsor may submit informed consent forms to a central IRB or IEC for review and approval or favorabl e opi[INVESTIGATOR_216338].  
Before recruitment and enrollment, where developmentally appropriate, each prospective 
candidate will be given a full explanation of the study, allowed to read the approved informed 
conse nt form or assent form for prospective candidates < [ADDRESS_259987] been 
answered and the investigator is assured that the individual or parent or legal guardian for 
individuals <  [ADDRESS_259988] will be asked to give consent or assent for subjects < 18 years of age to participate in the study by [CONTACT_79844]/assent form. As part of the consent process, each subject 
must consent to direct access to his/her medical records for study -related monitoring, auditing, 
IRB/IEC review and regulatory inspection. The investigator will provide a copy of the signed 
informed consent form to each subject. For subjects < 18 years , the parent or legal guardian will 
be required to provide written informed consent. For subjects who become 18 years of age 
during the course of this study, they will need to give informed consent upon becoming 18 years of age (or as soon as possible thereafter).  
For this study, the parents or guardians must give permission for their children to participate and demonstrate their agreement by [CONTACT_216381]. The child or teenager will be provided with a form that explains, in age-appropriate terms, the purpose of the research, 
what they will be asked to do, and what procedures they will undergo. For this study, where 
developmentally appropriate, the assent of the child/or adolescent is deemed required. The assent 
process is an ongoing, interactive conversation between the research team and the child or young 
adult. If at any time the child or young adult shows signs of dissent, the assessment should be 
stopped, the situation assessed and assent established to continue. It should always be made clear that the young person has the right to leave the trial, at any time and for any reason, without 
penalty or consequences, and that any information gathered will be kept confidential. 
If an amen dment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, 
or increases the potential risk to the subject, the informed consent form must be revised, 
submitted to the IRB or IEC for review and approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The revised informed 
consent form must be used to obtain consent from a subject currently enrolled in the study if he 
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.[ADDRESS_259989] Privacy 
The Sponsor’s staff or any designees affirm and uphold the subject’s confidentiality. Throughout 
this study, all data forward to the Sponsor will be identified only by [CONTACT_23523], 
date of birth, gender, and initials. The investigator agrees that its representatives, its designee, representatives of the relevant IRB/IEC or representatives of the regulatory authorities will be 
allowed to review that portion of the subject’s primary medical records that directly concerns this 
study (including, but not limited to, clinical laboratory test result reports, ECG reports, admission/discharge summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1684] a subject’s study 
participation and autopsy reports for deaths occurring during the study). 
For the studies conducted in the US, in accordance with the Healthcare Insurance, Portability, 
and Accountability Act of 1996, the investigator will prepare a privacy authorizat ion form and 
provide the form to CRO/Sponsor for approval prior to submission to the IRB/IEC or to a Privacy Board. CRO/Sponsor may provide a template privacy authorization form to be qualified by [CONTACT_29988]. The content of the privacy 
authorization form must comply with the regulations governing the authorization. All 
prospective study candidates will be given full explanation of the privacy authorization form, allowed to read the approved form, and be provided the opportunity to ask any questions. Once 
all questions have been answered and the investigator is assured that the individual understands 
the implications of the privacy authorization form, the subject will be asked to sign the privacy authorization. The authorization remains in effect until revoked by [CONTACT_423]. The investigator 
will provide a copy of the signed privacy authorization form to each subject. Subjects who do not sign the privacy authorization form will not be permitted to participate in th e study. 
16.5. Protocol Amendments and Emergency Deviations 
Changes to the research covered by [CONTACT_216382]. Amendments to the protocol may be initiated by [CONTACT_216383] . In ei ther case, a formal amendment cannot be initiated until the Sponsor has 
approved it, the investigator has signed it off, and it has been reviewed and has received approval 
or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_216339]. 
Emergency deviations or modifications may be initiated without the Sponsor’s or IRB/IEC 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], only in cases where the change is necessary to eliminate an 
immediate apparent hazard to subjects. Emergency deviations or modifications must be reported to CRO/Sponsor and the IRB/IEC within five business days of the occurrence, or in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements.  
16.6. Monitoring and Auditing of the Study  
A clinical monitor, whether an employee of the Sponsor or its designated representative, has the obligation to follow this study closely. In doing so, the monitor will visit the clinical study sites 
at periodic intervals, in addition to maintaining necessary telephone and letter contact. The monitor will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of 
Protocol D1050302 Version 4.[ADDRESS_259990] access to any and all study -related documentation including source 
documentation, regardless of location and format. The Sponsor audit reports will be kept highly 
confidential.  
16.7. Study Documentation  
As part of the responsibilities assumed by [CONTACT_6231], the investigator agrees to 
maintain adequate case histories for the subjects treated as part of the research under this 
protocol. The investigator agrees to maintain accurate sou rce documentation and CRFs as part of 
the case histories.  
Study records are comprised of source documents, CRFs, and all other administrative documents, eg, IRB/IEC correspondence, clinical study materials and supplies shipment manifests, monitoring logs, Sponsor and CRO correspondence, etc. A study specific binder will 
be provided with instructions for the maintenance of study records. 
Source documentation is defined as any hand written or computer generated document that 
contains medical information or te st results that have been collected for or is in support of the 
protocol specifications, eg, clinical lab reports, clinic notes, drug disbursement log, subject sign in sheets, subject completed questionnaires, telephone logs, ECGs, etc. All draft, preliminary and pre final iterations of a final report are also considered to be source documents, eg, faxed lab 
reports and hard copy lab reports, faxed initial results and hard copy, final report.  
CRO/Sponsor will supply CRFs. All requested information must be entered on the CRFs. Every 
effort should be made to complete all forms in their entirety. If an item is not available or is not 
applicable, this fact should be indicated; do not leave a space blank. Each set of completed CRFs 
must be reviewed, electronical ly signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. 
 
16.8. Laboratory Certification and Normal Values 
A central laboratory will be used for analysis for most of the clinical labs for this study. The central laboratory will provide the investigator, CRO, and Sponsor with laboratory 
certification(s), a dated copy of normal range values for the central clinical laboratory selected to 
analyze clinical specimens, and the lab director’s CV. If an exception is granted to use a local 
laboratory, the investigator must supply the CRO/Sponsor with laboratory certification, lab 
director’s CV and a current, dated copy of normal range values. 
 
16.9. Records Retention 
The investigator agrees to retain study records for the time periods stated below. The investigator agrees to contact [INVESTIGATOR_30909]/Sponsor  before destroying any study documentation. Should the 
investigator leave the site at which the study was conducted, CRO/Sponsor will be contact[CONTACT_216384]. 
Records will be retained until at least [ADDRESS_259991] retention periods will be sent in writing from 
CRO/Sponsor. If an investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation), the records will be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (ie, another investigator ). This transfer is subject 
to Sponsor approval and will be documented in writing and a copy sent to the Sponsor. 
Electronic Data Capture/ePRO Data Archiving: 
In compliance with data retention requirements, and after the capture phase of the study is 
complete, the site will receive a copy of all eSource data and accompanying audit trail from the 
EDC and/or ePRO vendors. The vendors shall certify the integrity of the copy (certified copy) and send it on commonly readable storage material (CD or DVD); if necessary, software for 
viewing the data files and instruction on installation and use of the software will also be 
included. This read -only archive will be retained, protected, and made accessible by [CONTACT_216385]. 
16.10.  Inspection of Records 
In the event of an inspection, the investigator agrees to allow representatives of the Sponsor, its repres entative, the Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory authorities’ access to all 
study records. The investigator will promptly notify CRO/Sponsor of all requests to inspect by [CONTACT_29993] a copy of all such inspec tion reports. 
16.11.  Financial Disclosure  
Prior to the start of the study, investigator s will release sufficient and accurate financial 
information that permits CRO/Sponsor to demonstrate that an investigator and all sub-investigators listed on the Form FDA 1572, if appropriate, have no personal or professional 
financial incentive regarding the future approval or disapproval of the study medication such that 
his or her research might be biased by [CONTACT_180220]. Investigators will provide an update of the above financial information at the end of the study and one year following the end of the study.

• Mild  - awareness of event but easily tolerated.  
• Moderate - discomfort enough to cause some interference with normal activity. 
• Severe - inability to carry out usual activity.  
The investigator must assess the relationship of the AE to the study medication using the 
following: 
• Unrelated – improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to other drugs or 
underlying disease.  
• Unlikely  - occurs with a temporal relationship to treatment administration that makes a 
causal relationship improbable, and in which other medications, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
• Possible  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but could be 
related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
• Probable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is unlikely to 
be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there is a plausible 
mechanism to implicate the study drug.  
• Related - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_29969]. The adverse event should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not mandatory before assigning a definite 
causality.  
Frequency will be defined using the following terms and definitions: 
• Once  – an isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
• Intermittent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.  
• Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The action taken regarding study drug will be defined as follows: 
• Dose Not Changed  – no change. 
• Dose Increased.  
• Dose Reduced.  
• Drug Interrupted  – study drug stopped temporarily. 
• Drug Withdrawn – study drug stopped permanently. 
• Not Applicable.

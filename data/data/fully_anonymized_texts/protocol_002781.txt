will randomize approximately 36  subjects to 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio (approximately 
24 subjects to SEP -363856 and 12 to placebo). 
The study will consist of 4 periods: Screening/Washout Period (up to 14 days prior to Double-blind 
Treatment ), Double- blind Treatment Period (6 weeks), Open-label SEP-363856 Treatment Period 
(12 weeks), and Follow-up Period ([ADDRESS_471564] dose) as shown in the following figure. All post-
Baseline clinic visits will have a window of ± 2 days relative to the date of the Baseline visit (Visit  3).

Confidential and Proprietary 6 18 June 2019 Study Sche matic 
Note: Double -blind ends with Day 43 assessments; Open -label extension begins Day [ADDRESS_471565] dose in the evening.  
Screening/Washout Period (Days -14 to -1): 
Subjects who provided written informed consent to participate in the study will be evaluated for 
eligibility during a screening/washout period of up to [ADDRESS_471566]’s caregiver must also 
provide consent for the subject to participate in this study  as well as consent for collection of 
caregiver data  as related to the assessment of the subject’s neuropsychiatric status measured by [CONTACT_376844]. The screening visit may occur over more than one day . The washout period can start 
immediately at screening. Prior treatment with antipsychotic agents must be discontinued at least 
5 half-lives prior to the site performing the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_376800].  
Subjects who meet the study entry criteria at screening (see  inclusion criteria in the full protocol in 
Section 8.1) and have gone through the washout period , as necessary,  will enter the 6-week 
double-blind treatment period. 
Double-blind Treatment Period (6  weeks): 
Randomization/Treatment: 
At Baseline ( Day 1, Visit 3), subjects who have successfully completed screening/washout  will be 
randomly assigned via interactive voice/web response system (IXRS) in a 2:1 ratio to SEP-363856 or 
placebo. Study drug dosing will begin  following completion of the baseline assessments on the same 
day (Day 1, Visit 3). Double-blind study drug will be taken in- clinic at the Baseline visit (Day  1) and 
on visit days when subjec t titrates up . Subsequent doses starting the following day should be taken at 
bedtime. For the remainder of the study, subjects will take one capsule of study drug per day at 
approximately the same time each evening at bedtime. After receiving the initial dose (Day 1) and 
after each  up-titration subjects will remain in the clinic for 2 hours of clinical observation; which will 
include assessments of orthostatic vital signs (1  hour [± 15 min] and 2 hours [± 15  min] post dose) , 
additional medical assessments can be performed as needed per investigator discretion . Findings will 
be collected on appropriate case report forms (CRFs). Subjects will be discharged home if medically stable. Dosing will continue once daily (QD) at bedtime for the remainder of the study, without regard 
for food. 
Subjects will have clinic visits and procedures as outlined in Table 2.Telephone calls to the subjects 
will be made on the first 2  days after a dose adjustment . An unscheduled visit will be made as early as 

Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 7 18 June 2019 possible for dose adju stments or evaluation of safety/tolerability iss ues. Efforts will be made to ensure 
that the subject’s caregiver remains the same for all study visits. All post -Baseline clinic visits will 
have a window of ± 2 days relative to the date o f the Baseline visi t (Visit 3). 
Subjects randomized to SEP -363856 will receive flexible doses of SEP-363856 (25, 50, or 75 mg /day). 
Subjects will receive SEP -363856 25 mg/day for 1 week (Days 1  - 7). If there are no safety or 
tolerability issues  subjects should be up- titrated to 50 mg/day at Visit 4 (Week 2). Subjects still 
receiving SEP-363856 25 mg /day must have their dose up - titrated to 50  mg/day at Visit 5 (Week 3), 
unless approved to stay at 25  mg/day by [CONTACT_376845] . At the 
investigator’s discretion, subject may up -titrate to 75  mg during scheduled visits. During the 
double-blind period, up-t itration will not be allowed after Visit 6 (Week 5). Dose reductions to 
50 mg/day or 25 mg /day will be allowed  by 1 dose level , at any time for reasons of safety and 
tolerability. During the double -blind period, f ollowing a dose reduction, subjects may increase their dose 
to the next dose level up to Visit 6 (Week 5) at the Investigator’s discretion and  only during scheduled 
visits. If safety or tolerability issues result in study dose discontinuation or reduction, the I nvestigator  
must contact [CONTACT_376846]. The study medication can be 
re-introduced if agreed to by [CONTACT_376847]. 
Dosi
ng Schematic  
Notes: 
•Dose reduction is allowed at any time for reasons of safety or tolerability; during unscheduled or scheduled
visits.
•During the Double -Blind Period, up-titration to a prior dose level is allowed at Investigator’s discretion and
only during a scheduled visit .
•At Visit 5 (Week 3), the dose should be up titrated to 50mg/day. In the event of tolerability/safety
concerns, the dose may remain at 25  mg/day with Medical Monitor approval.
•Visit 6 (Week 5) is the last visit whe re up-titration can occur during the Double -Blind Period.
Open-label Extension Period: 
For subjects who complete the DB period and continue  into the Open -Label (OL) extension,  the 
baseline visit for the open -label period will be the end of double -blind treatment period (Week 6 of 
DB period). Drug will be taken in -clinic on OL Day 1 (Study Day 43) of the open -label period  and on 

Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.[ADDRESS_471567] up -titrates; with subsequent dosing starting the following day at bedtime . 
For the remainder of the study, subjects will take one capsule of study drug per day at approximately the 
same time each evening at bedtime. After receiving the initial dose of 25 mg (OL Day 1) and after each 
up-titration, subjects will remain in the clinic for 2  hours of clinical  observation; which include 
assessments of orthostatic vital signs (1  hour [± 15 min] and 2 hours [± 15 min] post dose); additional 
medical assessments can be performed as needed per investigator discretion. Findings will be collected 
on appropriate case r eport forms (CRFs). Subjects will be discharged home if medically stable. Dosing 
will continue once daily (QD) at bedtime for the remainder of the study, without regard for food.  
The total daily dose will remain between 25  mg/day and 75 mg /day for the 12 -week treatment period. 
Subjects will receive SEP -363856 25 mg /day for 1 week.  If there are no safety or tolerability issues,  
subjects should be up-titrated to 50 mg/day at Visit 8 (OL Week 2; OL Day  8). Subjects still receiving 
SEP-363856 25 mg /day should have their dose up- titrated to 50  mg/day at Visit 9 (OL Week 3), 
however may remain at 25 mg /day due to safety/tolerability issues wi th medical monitor approval . At 
the investigator’s discretion, subject may up -titrate to 75  mg during scheduled visits. 
Dose reductions will be allowed by 1 dose level, at any time for reasons of safety and tolerability. 
Following a dose reduction, subjects may increase their dose at the Investigator’s discretion and only during scheduled visits. If safety or tolerability issu es result in study medication dose discontinuation 
or reduction, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_376848]-challenged. 
The study medication can be re -introduced if agreed to  by [CONTACT_24318]. 
A minimum of  7 days is required between dose increases. Dose decreases may be made at any time, at 
the Investigator’s discretion, for reasons of safety or tolerability.  If, in the judgment of the 
investigator, the subject does not tolerate the minimum required dos e (25 mg/day), the subject  will be 
discontinued from the study. 
During the OL treatment period, subjects will return to the clinic and have assessments as described in 
Table 3. 
Telephone calls to the subjects will be made on the first 2 days after a dose adjustment (increase or 
decrease). At Study Week  12 and Study Week  16 (midpoint between Visit 11 and Visit 12, and 
midpoint between Visit 12 and Visit 13) the site staff will contact [CONTACT_376849], SAEs, and concomitant medications, as well as to remind subjects about adherence 
to study drug administration, and upcoming visits. If necessary, an unscheduled visit will be made as 
early as possible for dose adjustments or evaluation  of safety/tolerability issues . 
Follow-up Period (7 days): 
All subjects who either complete the Treatment Period or discontinue early will have a Follow-up 
Visit for final safety assessments 7  days (± 2 days) after the last dose of study drug.

Statistical Methods:  
The analysis of efficacy will be based on the modi fied Intent- to-Treat (mITT) population, which 
includes all subjects who are randomized, have received at least one dose of study drug, and have a 
Baseline and at least one post -Baseline efficacy measurement. The analysis of safety assessments will 
use the Safety population, which includes all subjects who are randomized and have received at least 
one dose of study drug. 
The primary efficacy variable is the change from baseline in SAPS-PD score at Week 6 during the DB 
period for testing superiority of SEP -363856 to placebo. A Mixed Model for Repeated Measures 
(MMRM) will be used for this comparison. The MMRM model will include factors for treatment, 
visit (as a categorical variable), and treatment- by-visit interaction, and include baseline SAPS- PD 
score as a covariate. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used for the within -subject correlation 
and the Kenward- Rogers approximation will be used to calculate the denominator degree of freedom.  
The secondary efficacy variables including change from baseline i n CGI-S scores at Week  6, as well 
as change from baseline in NPI [INVESTIGATOR_376803]  6 and will be analyzed similarly.  
Descriptive statistics of observed values and changes from DB baseline and OL baseline in SAPS-PD, 
CGI-S score, NPI [INVESTIGATOR_182913], MMSE  total score , SCOPA-NS and SCOPA -DS total scores, and 
RBDQ total score will be summarized by [CONTACT_765].  
Safety data including AEs, laboratory values, clinical evaluations, and C- SSRS will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_376858] (DB treatment period, open- label extension period) . 
Adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation, and serious AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1601], 
for each treatment group, the number and percentage of subjects with any AE, and AEs by [CONTACT_53428]. Adverse events will be further summarized by [CONTACT_128498]. The summary of AEs will include any AE occurring on or after the first 
dose of study drug.  
Sample Size:  
A total of  approximately  36 subjects will be randomiz ed in 2:1 ratio to SEP-363856 and placebo, with 
approximately 24 subjects assigned to SEP -363856 and 12 subjects assigned to placebo. The sample 
size will provide powers of 59%, 48%, 37%, and 27% to detect treatment effect sizes of 0.8, 0.7, 0.6,

Confidential and Proprietary 31 18 June 2019 4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor control. It is 
the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease and affects 
approximately 1 million people in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) and 7 million people glob ally. The 
mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5 to 10% of cases, classified as young onset PD 
(YOPD), begin between the ages of 20 and 50. The main pathological characteristic of PD is 
neuronal cell death in the substantia nigra, which leads to loss of dopamine, a critical 
neurotransmitter  involved in movement control. PD has been increasingly recognized as having a 
multitude of non-motor symptoms including psychosis, cognitive impairment, and dementia mood disturbances, fatigue, apathy, and sleep disorders. 
Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP) is a common and debilitating condition. Symptoms 
commonly include visual hallucinations, delusions (paranoia) and illusions (misperception of 
objects). Estimates on the incidence of PDP vary widely depending on the study from 40% 
(Fénelon-2000, Chou-2005) to as high as 60% (Fénelon-2010 and Riedel -2010). The risk for 
PDP increases with disease duration and severity , as well as with  declines in cognitive function, 
increased age, depression, and sleep disorders ( Papapetropoulous-2005). PDP has also been 
associated with poorer quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality in addition to increased caregiver burden and nursing home placement ( Aarsland-2000). Underlying pathogenesis 
remains uncertain although psychotic symptoms are likely attributable in part to the effects of dopamine agonists used in the treatment of PD. Dopaminergic agonists can stimulate limbic dopamine D2 receptors to produce psychotic symptoms, in much the same way as in 
schizophrenia. Although lowering the dose of dopamine agonists can alleviate the symptoms of 
PDP, they can also worsen the motor symptoms associated with PD. Disturbances in 5- HT 
(5-hydroxytryptamine [serotonin]), including 5- HT
2A, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C receptors, may also 
contribute to PDP as well other behavioral disorders associated with PD such as depression and anxiety (Ballanger -2010). 
Treatment of psychosis involves the use of typi[INVESTIGATOR_376808], which 
act predominantly as dop amine D
2 receptor anta gonists. For PDP, such pharmacological 
treatment is fraught with risk as D 2 antagonism may also target the symptomatic dopamine ( DA) 
replacement therapy used in PD and potentially worsen motor symptoms. In addition 
antipsychotics carry a boxed warning agai nst their use in elderly patients with psychosis due to 
increased mortality and morbidity ( Friedman -2010). Two agents commonly used to treat PD P 
are clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_376809] -label use. 
Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_376810] 5- HT2A receptors than for D 2 receptors . Low-dose 
clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (≤ 50 mg ) has been demonstrated as an effective treatment ( The Parkinson Study 
Group-1999); the dose levels used in PDP are significantly lower than  the therapeutic dose used 
for the treatment of schizophrenia (300 - 900 mg ). The use of low-dose clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_376811] , 
however, is limited by [CONTACT_376864], in particular, agranulocytosis , which is not dose related 
(Thomas-2010).  
Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_376812],  similar in structure to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. It exhibits stro ng 
antagonism of 5HT 2 receptors and weak antagonism of D 2 receptors. The American Academy of 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856

completed clinical study investigating the use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_376816]- PD 
(Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms – Parkinson’s Disease) and in several secondary 
and exploratory outcomes, including the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement ( CGI-I) and 
Clinical Global Impression  – Severity (CGI-S), night- time sleep, daytime wakefulness and 
caregiver burden ( Cummings -2014). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_376817] -tolerated; however, there was an 
imbalance of serious adverse events including death in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_376818] (serious adverse event) SAE was more prominent than 
others. In addition, pharmacokinetic ( PK) studies showed that pi[INVESTIGATOR_376819] -
state plasma levels until after 10  to 14 days of repeated daily administration in PD patients 
(Hacksell-2014) while improvement in psychotic symptoms was not observed until 2 to 3 weeks 
after initiation of treatment (Cummings -2014). 
Effective agents for PDP are scarce and serious adverse side effects associated with their use are limiting. Although pi[INVESTIGATOR_376820] a promising agent, concerns remain for its modest 
efficacy, safety and its delay in onset of action, which  together may limit its use . The 
development of effective and well -tolerated treatments for patients with PDP is therefore 
warranted . 
4.2. Study Conduct Rationale  
SEP-363856 is a  central nervous system (CNS) active drug, which shows broad efficacy in 
animal models of schizophrenia (positive and negative symptoms) and depression. The molecular target responsible for this profile of effects has not been completely elucidated, but 
may include actions at 5 -HT1A and trace amine- associated  1 (TAAR1) receptors. Rat 
electroencephalogram (EEG) studies showed that SEP-363856 dose dependently suppressed 
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In nonhuman primate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, pretreatment with SEP-363856 reduces the ketamine brain fMRI response 
in rhesus monkey in a pattern analogous to that observed with risperidone, supporting an 
antipsychotic- like profile. Together these data revealed that SEP-363856 exhi bits clear, 
functional CNS pharmacodynamic signals in rats and nonhuman primates. Importantly, 
SEP-363856 was not shown to cause Parkinson’s symptoms (eg, catalepsy) in preclinical 
models. 
As of [ADDRESS_471592] received SEP-363856 in 8 completed 
Phase 1 clinical studies  (SEP361-101, SEP361-103, SEP361-104, SEP361-105, SEP361-106, 
SEP361-108, SEP361-111, and DA801002). An additional 199 subjects received oral doses of 
SEP-363856 in studies in adults with schizophrenia: Phase 2 Study SEP361-201 (safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy in adult subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia; clinical study report is 
pending), Phase 2 Study SEP361-202 (long- term safety and maintenance of effect in subjects 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 33 18 June 2019 diagnosed with schizophrenia and Phase 1 Study DA801004 (safety, tolerability, multiple 
ascending dose PK, in Japanese subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia). 
Evidence for target engagement and pharmacodynamic effects were demonstrated in the 
following studies. 
• Study SEP361-103 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover 
polysomnography (PSG) study that investigated the effect of a single oral dose 
(50 mg and 10 mg ) of SEP-363856 on REM sleep suppression in healthy adult male 
subjects. A single 50 mg  oral dose of SEP-363856 suppressed REM sleep in all 
subjects (increased latency to REM sleep and reduced time spent in REM sleep) and increased non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM) sleep stage 2 (N2), and NREM 
sleep stage 3 (N3) (deep or slow wave sleep). A single 10 mg  dose of SEP -363856 
also increased latency to REM sleep to a lesser extent, but did not reduce time spent 
in REM sleep.  
• Study SEP361-104 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose 
study of the effects of SEP-363856 (50  mg) and amisulpride (400 mg ) on blood 
oxygen level dependent ( BOLD)-fMRI signal s in healthy male and female adult 
subjects with high or l ow schizotype characteristics. FMRI was used in combination 
with the monetary incentive delay (MID) task to examine  the single dose effects  of 
SEP-[ADDRESS_471593] processing. During the anticipation/motivational 
phase of the MID task, SEP -[ADDRESS_471594] 
amisulpride.  
• Study SEP361-106 (Part 2) was an open -label study that investigated the PK and 
efficacy of SEP-363856 75 mg  given QD for 28 days  to 16 male and female subjects 
with schizophrenia. Treatment demonstrated improvement in efficacy (PANSS total score, CGI-S) compared with Baseline. Furthermore, ad hoc subgroup analyses 
showed a significantly greater decrease from Baseline in PANSS total scores at the 
end of the 28-day treatment period in subjects who had less frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_376821].  
• Study SEP361-108 evaluated the effects of SEP-363856 25 and 50 mg  given QD for 
14 days compared with placebo in 15 adult male and female subjects with narcolepsy -
cataplexy. The frequency of cataplexy attacks and overall narcolepsy symptoms were assessed by [CONTACT_87791] -I scale. The primary objective of the study was not met, as 
SEP-363856 did not demonstrate separation from placebo at either dose studied 
(25 and 50 mg  QD) for the primary endpoints (total number of cataplexy attacks and 
CGI-I) at the end of the 2 week treatment period. However, SEP-363856 did 
demonstrate suppression of REM in narcoleptic subjects (Night 1 data), which was maintained with repeated dosing ( Day [ADDRESS_471595] on sleep onset REM periods). These 
data demonstrate that central activity was observed at both doses studied (25 and 50 mg QD). 
Overall, across all clinical studies conducted as of 24 September  2018, SEP-363856 has been 
generally well -tolerated. The majority of adverse events (AEs) observed to date have been mild 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 34 18 June 2019 to moderate in severity and non-serious . One death due to acute cardiovascular insufficiency was 
reported in the SEP-363856 group in Study SEP361-201; final autopsy results identified 
significant chronic coronary heart disease as contributing to the cause of death. Treatment -

which occurred in subjects with schizophrenia enrolled in studies SEP361-[ADDRESS_471597] been transient, mild or moderate in intensity  and the majority 
did not require concomitant treatment or intervention. The PK and safety profiles observed in 
adult subjects from completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies supports the evaluation  of 
flexibly-dosed SEP -363856 at 25, 50 or 75 mg /day in adult subjects with PDP. 
PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor control. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease and affects approximately 
1 million people in the US  and 7 million globally. PDP has been associated with poorer quality 
of life, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased caregiver burden and nursing home 
placement ( Aarsland-2000). Nuplazid

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study evaluating the 
efficacy, safety, and tol erability of double-blind SEP -363856 flexibl y dosed at 25, 50, or 
75 mg/day for 6  weeks followed by 12 weeks of open- label extension SEP -363856 
flexibly-dosed at 25, 50, or 75 mg /day in male and female subjects ≥ 55 years of age with a 
clinical diagnosis of PDP. The study will randomize approximately  36 subjects to 2 treatment 
groups in a 2:1 ratio (approximately 24 subjects to SEP -363856 and 12 to placebo). 
The study will consist of 4  periods: Screening /Washout Period (up to 14 days  prior to Double-
blind Treatment ), Double-blind T reatment Period (6  weeks), Open -label SEP -363856 Treatment 
Period (12 weeks ), and Follow -up Period ([ADDRESS_471599] dose).  All post- Baseline clinic visits 
will have a window of ± 2 days relative to the date of the Baseline visit (Visit 3).  
A study schematic is presented in Figure 1. Details of the study assessments and other 
procedures to be performed at each visit are presented in Ta ble 2 and Table 3, Schedule of 
Assessments, and Section  11, Study Assessments.  If necessary, subjects may return to the clinic

Confidential and Proprietary 41 18 June 2019 Screening/Washout Period ( Days -14 to  -1): 
Subjects who provided written informed consent to participate in the study will be evaluated for 
eligibility during a screening/washout period of up to [ADDRESS_471601]’s caregiver must also provide consent for the subject to participate in this study as well as consent for collection of 
caregiver data as  related to the assessment of the subject’s neuropsychiatric status as measured 
by [CONTACT_183245] . The screening visit may occur over more than one day . The washout period can start 
immediately at screening. Prior treatment with antipsychotic agents must be discontinued at least  
5 half-lives prior to the site performing the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_376800].  
Subjects who meet the study entry criteria at screening  (see inclusion criteria in Section 8.1) and 
have gone through the washout period, as necessary , will enter the 6-week double-blind 
treatment period.  
Double-blind Treatment Period (6  weeks): 
Randomization/Treatment: 
At Baseline ( Day 1, Visit 3), subjects who have s uccessfully completed screening/washout (see 
randomization criteria  in Section 8.3) will be randomly assigned via interactive voice/web 
response system (IXRS) in a 2:1 ratio to SEP-363856 or placebo. Study drug dos ing will begin 
following completion of the baseline assessments on the same day ( Day 1, Visit 3). Double-blind 
study drug will be taken in -clinic at the Baseline visit ( Day 1) and on visit days when subject 
titrates up . Subsequent doses starting the following day should be taken at bedtime. For the 
remainder of the study, subjects will take one capsule of study drug per day at approximately the 
same time each evening at bed -time. After receiving the initial dose  (Day 1) and after each 
up-titration, subjects will remain in the clinic for 2  hours of clinical observation, which will 
include assessments of orthostatic vital signs  (1 hour [± 15 min] and 2 hours [± 15 min] post 
dose), additional medical assessments can be performed as needed per investigator dis cretion. 
Findings will be collected on appropriate case report forms (CRFs). Subjects will be discharged 
home if medically stable. Dosing will continue QD at bedtime for the remainder of the study, 
without regard for food. 
Subjects will have clinic visits and procedures as outlined in Table 2.  Telephone calls to  the 
subjects 
will be made on the first 2 days after a dose adjustment. An unscheduled visit will be 
made as early as possible for dose adjustments 
or evaluation of safety/tolerability is sues. Efforts 
will be made to ensure that the subject’s caregiver remains the s ame for all study visits. All post-
Baseline
 clinic visits will have a window of  ± 2 days relative to the date of the Baseline visit 
(Visit 3). 
Subjec
ts randomized to SEP -363856 will receive flexible doses of SEP-363856 (25, 50, or 
75 mg/day). Subjects wil l receive SEP -363856 25 mg/day for 1  week (Days 1  - 7). If there are no 
safety or tolerability issues,  subjects should be up-titrated to 50 mg/day at Visit 4 (Week 2). 
Subjects still receiving SEP -363856 25 mg /day must have their dose up- titrated to 50  mg/day at 
Visit 5 (Week 3), unless approved to stay at 25 mg /day by [CONTACT_376869]. At the investigator’s discretion, subject may up- titrate to 75  mg during 
scheduled visits. During the double-blind period up-t itration will not be allowed after Visit 6 
(Week 5). Dose reductions to 50 mg /day or 25 mg /day will be allowed  by 1 dose level, at any 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 42 18 June 2019 time for reasons of safety and tolerability. During the double-blind period, following a dose 
reduction, subjects may increase their dose to the next dose level up to Visit  6 (Week 5) at the 
Investigator’s discretion and only during scheduled visi ts. If safety or tolerability issues result in 
study medication dose discontinuation or reduction, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_376870]. The study medication can be re -introduced if agreed 
to by [CONTACT_376871] M onitor.

Notes: 
• Dose reduction is allowed at any time for reasons of safety or tolerability; during unscheduled or scheduled 
visits.  
• During the Double -Blind Period , up-titration to a prior dose level is allowed at Investigator’s discretion and 
only during a scheduled visit . 
• At Visit 5 (Week 3), the dose should be up titrated to 50mg/day. In the event of tolerability/safety concerns, the 
dose may remain at 25 mg/day with Medical Monitor approval.  
• Visit 6 (Week 5) is the last visit where up -titration can occur during the Double -Blind Period. 
 
Open-label Extension Period:  
For subjects who complete the DB period and continue into the O pen-label (OL) period, the 
baseline visit for the open-label period will be the end of double- blind treatment period (Week 6 
of DB period). Drug will be taken in -clinic on OL Day 1 (Study Day 43) of the open- label period  
and on study visit days when subject up- titrates; with subsequent do sing starting the following 
day at bedtime. For the remainder of the study, subjects will take one capsule of study drug per 
day at approximately the same time each evening at bedtime. After receiving the initial dose of 
25 mg (OL Day 1) and after each up-titration, subjects will remain in the clinic for 2  hours of 
clinical observation; which will include assessments of orthostatic vital signs (1  hour [± 15 min] 
and 2 hours [± 15 min] post dose); additional medical assessments can be performed as needed 
per investigator discretion. Findings will be collected on appropriate case report forms (CRFs). 

Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 43 18 June 2019 Subjects will be discharged home if medically stable. Dosing will continue once daily (QD) at 
bedtime for the remainder of the study, without regard for food. 
The total daily dose will remain between 25  mg/day and 75 mg /day for the 12-week treatment 
period. Subjects will receive SEP -363856 25 mg /day for 1 week. If there are no safety or 
tolerability issues, subjects should be up- titrated to 50  mg/day at Visit 8 (OL  Week 2; OL 
Day 8). Subjects still receiving SEP -363856 25 mg /day must have their dose up- titrated to 
50 mg/day at Visit 9 (OL Week 3), however may remain at 25  mg/day due to safety/tolerability 
issues with medical monitor approval . At the investigator’s discretion, subject may up- titrate to 
75 mg during scheduled visits.  
Dose reductions will be allowed by 1 dose level, at any time for reasons of safety and 
tolerability. Following a dose reduction, subjects may increase their dose at the Investigator’s 
discretion and only during scheduled visits. If safety or tolerability issues result in study medication dose discontinuation or reduction, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_376872] -challenged. The study medication can be re-introduced if agreed on by 
[CONTACT_24318].  
A minimum of  7 days is required between dose increases. Dose decreases may be made at any 
time, at the Investigator’s discretion, for reasons of safety or tolerability. If, in the judgment of 
the investigator, the subject does not tolerate the minimum required dose (25 mg /day), the 
subject will be discontinued from the study. 
During the OL extension treatment period, subjects will return to the clinic and have assessments 
as described in Table 3. 
Telephone call s to the subjects will be made on the first 2 days after a dose adjustment (increase 
or decrease) . At Study Week 12 and Study Week  16 (midpoint between Visit  11 and Visit 12, 
and midpoint between V isit 12 and Visit 13) the site staff will contact [CONTACT_376873], SAEs, and concomitant medications, as well as to remind subjects 
about adherence to study drug administration, and upcoming visits. If necessary, an unscheduled 
visit will be made as early as possible for dose adjustments or evaluation of safety/tolerability 
issues. 
Follow-up Period (7  days): 
All subjects who either complete the treatment period or discontinue early will have a follow -up 
visit for final safety assessments 7  days (± 2 days ) after the last dose of study drug. 
7.1.1. Study Assessments  
Double Blind  Period: 
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_376850] -PD, the NPI, CGI-S, and the MMSE. Safety and 
tolerability will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_376851], clinical laboratory 
parameters, ECGs, vital signs, PE and NE, C-SSRS, body weight, and BMI. Subjects who have 
significant findings for suicidal ideation upon completion of the C- SSRS at any time during the 
study must be referred to the investig ator for follow -up evaluation.

7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
7.2.1. Treatment Assignment  
The randomization schedule will be generated by a non- study biostatistician. Once a subject is 
deemed eligible to be randomized at Day  1 (Visit 3), the IXRS will perform treatment 
assignment. Subjects will be randomized to  one of the following treatment groups for the double-
blind treatment period in a 2:1 ratio (SEP-363856:placebo) : 
•SEP-363856 (25, 50 or 75 mg /day flexible dosing QD for 6 weeks)
•Placebo (QD for 6 weeks)
Once a randomization number has been assigned, it cannot be reused. 
7.2.2. Blinding 
During the Double-blind Treatment Period , subjects, Investi gator staff, persons performing the 
assessments, clinical operations personnel, data analysts, and personnel at central laboratories 
will remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock and unblinding, using the following methods; (1) randomization data are kept strictly 
confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible by [CONTACT_376877]; 
(2) the identity of the treatments will be concealed by [CONTACT_376878], labeling, schedule of administration and appearance. 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.[ADDRESS_471602] should return for a final study 
assessment as described in Section 11.9.9. 
7.3. Rationale 
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SEP-363856 flexibl y dosed at 25, 50, or 
75 mg/day for 6  weeks followed by 12 weeks of open-label extension of SEP-363856 
flexibly-dosed at 25, 50, or 75 mg /day in male and female subjects ≥  [ADDRESS_471603] ion of safety and efficacy data in an elderly  population will 
further support the development program for SEP-363856, which to date has collected  data in 
adult healthy volunteer subjects and younger adult patients with acute schizophrenia , age 18-
40 years. There are no data in a patient population > 65 years treated with SEP -363856. The 
open-label extension will provide additional safety, tolerability  and efficacy data of SEP -363856 
flexibly dosed at 25, 50, or 75 mg /day for an additional 12 weeks in subjects with a clinical 
diagnosis of PDP. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
In the present study, flexible doses of SEP-363856 at 25, 50, or 75 mg /day will be investigated.  
Selection of this dose range was guided by [CONTACT_716]: 
• Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined for single doses of SEP-363856 
administered to healthy adult male subjects in Study SEP361 -101 (50 mg ) 
• Doses administered to healthy adult male subjects (Studies SEP3 61-103 and 
SEP361-104) in which SEP-[ADDRESS_471604] CNS activity (50 mg ) 
• Study SEP361-104 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study  in healthy 
male and female subjects with high or low schizotype characteristics demonstrating 
effects of SEP -363856 (50 mg ) in brain regions such as the orbito- frontal cortex, 
insula and striatum 
• Study SEP361-108 in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, suppression of REM sleep at 25 and 50 mg  QD demonstrating CNS activity  
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 46 18 June 2019 • In the open-label study SEP361-106 (Part  2) that investigated the PK and efficacy of 
SEP-363856 at 75 mg /day for 28  days in male and female subjects with 
schizophrenia, improvement in efficacy measures (PANSS total score, CGI -S) 
compared with Baseline  
Dose selection is further supported by [CONTACT_376879] 7 -day 
(10 - 75 mg, QD) and open- label 28-day (75 mg, QD) in patients with schizophrenia. Phase [ADDRESS_471605] also demonstrated dose-proportional increases in plasma SEP -363856 exposure 
(Cmax and AUC).  
SEP-[ADDRESS_471606] dose that showed CNS activity (25  mg). 
7.4. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who are terminated from the study  prior to study 
completion, the following study design and conduct elements are implemented: 
• Allowance of a dose reduction. Dose reductions to 50 mg /day or 25 mg /day will be 
allowed by 1 dose level, at any time for reasons of safety and tolerability.  
• Allowance of concomitant nonpsychotropic medications during study participation. 
• Use of study centers  with a good track record of enrolling a nd following eligible 
subjects. 
• Train the study centers on the importance of continued follow-up and on the informed 
consent process, ensuring subjects and caregivers understand the commitment they 
are making, including the intent to complete the trial. 
• Monitor data collection  at the site level for adherence during the study.

10.1. Study Drug 
Active and matched placebo doses (study drug) will be administered QD daily during the double-
blind treatment period. Double-blind study drug (active or matched -placebo, as applicable ) 
dosing will be  taken in-clinic at Visit 3 (Day 1) and Visit 7 (Day 43; OL Baseline Day 1); as well 
as on visit days when a subject up- titrates. Subsequent doses starting the following day should be 
taken at bedtime . For the remainder of the study, subjects will take one capsule of study drug per 
day at approxima tely the same time each evening  at bedtime.  
All study drug doses will consist of capsule(s) containing either SEP -363856 or matched placebo 
(in order to maintain blinding) administered orally QD. 
Subjects may take study drug without regard for food. 
Blood samples for determination of plasma SEP-363856 and SEP-363854 concentrations will be 
collected predose (before study drug administration) and postdose as describe in Table [ADDRESS_471625] be recorded. The time and date of food intake will be recorded on 
Day 43 when blood samples are collected for determination of plasma SEP-363856 
concentrations. 
10.1.1. Dosage
 Adjustment Criteria  
During the DB treatment period: Subjects randomized to SEP -363856 will receive flexible doses of SEP-363856 (25, 50, or 
75 mg/day). Subjects will receive SEP -363856 25 mg/day for 1  week (Days 1  - 7). If there are no 
safety or tolerability issues,  subjects should be up-titrated to 50 mg/day. Subjects still receiving 
SEP-363856 25 mg/day must have their dose up- titrated to 50  mg/day at Visit 5 (Week 3). At the 
investigator’s discretion, subject may up- titrate to 75  mg during scheduled visits. Up-t itration will 
not be allowed after Visit 6 (Week 5). Dose r eductions will be allowed by  1 dose level,  at any 
time for reasons of safety and tolerability. Following a dose reduction, subjects may increase 
their dose to the next dose level  up to Visit 6 ( Week 5) at the I nvestigator’s discretion and only 
during scheduled visits . If safety or tolerability issues result in study medication dose 
discontinuation or reduction, the Investigator m ust contact [CONTACT_376880] -challenged. The study medication can be re-introduced if agreed on by [CONTACT_159857]. 
Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo treatment throughout the study. During the OL  extension  treatment period:  
Subjects will receive flexible doses of SEP -363856 (25, 50, or 75 mg /day). Subjects will receive 
SEP-363856 25 mg /day for 1 week.  If there are no safety or tolerability issues,  subjects should 
be up-titrated to  50 mg/day at Visit 8 (OL Week 2; OL Day 8). Subjects still receiving 
SEP-363856 25 mg/day must have their dose up- titrated to 50  mg/day at Visit 9 (OL Week 3). At 
the investigator’s discretion, subject may up -titrate to 75  mg during scheduled visits. Dose 
reductions will be allowed by 1 dose level, at any time for reasons of safety and tolerability. 
Following a dose reduction, subjects may increase their dose at the I nvestigator’s discretion and 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.[ADDRESS_471626] be monitored closely and determined at each visit. Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_376881] (per capsule count) 
by [CONTACT_29959] a visit period and multiplying by 100. All subjects will be reminded of the importance of strict compliance with taking study 
drug for the effectiveness of treatment and for the successful outcome of the study. Subjects who miss more than 25% of scheduled doses or take more than 125% of the scheduled doses will be considered noncompliant. Evidence of noncompliance must be immediately reported to the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) and/or Medical Monitor . 
10.3. Concomitant Medication s 
The following information on a ll medication  administered between screening and study 
follow-up or at discontinuation will be recorded on the CRF: Medication name, dose, frequency, 
route, start date, stop date, indication, and whether the medication was started after las t dose of

10.6. Guidance for Overdose  
Potential overdose to SEP -[ADDRESS_471631]’s caregiver remains the same caregiver for all 
study visits. For this study a caregiver should be involved in the daily care of the subject and 
have detailed knowledge of the subject’s behavior. 
The same study site rater should perform the same scale assessment (s) for a given subject, 
whenever possible. 
All post-B aseline DB treatment visits will have a window of ± 2 days relative to the date of the 
Baseline visit (Visit 3).  
The SAPS- PD, CGI-S, MMSE , UPDRS II, UPDRS  III, and neurological exam  should be 
performed during the subject’s on-periods (ie, at a time when th e subject shows no clinical 
evidence of worsening in their Parkinson’s symptoms, as determined by [CONTACT_6962]). 
The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_376825]’s 
on-period. 
For this study 1 week is defined as 7  days and 1 month is defined as 4 weeks (28 days).  
11.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics (date of birth, sex, ethnicity, race), prior and current medications, and medical and 
psychiatric history will be collected.  
A medical history will be obtained by [CONTACT_376882] 1572. If the subject’s historical medical care was provided at another institution or 
location, documented efforts must be made to obtain these outside records to verif y that the 
subject meets all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. The Medical History will subsequently be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
At screening subjects will be checked for multiple study enrollment by [CONTACT_376883].  
11.2. Prior and Concomitant Medication Review 
See Section 10.[ADDRESS_471632] all medications taken  within 30 days prior to screening visit in the eCRF. The 
following parameters will be recorded for all prior and concomitant medications: drug name, 
route of administration, total daily dose, unit, frequency, start/stop dates, indication, and whether 
the medication was started after last dose of study medication. The prior and concomitant 
medications will subsequently be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
(WHO-DD). 
Site staff will also record all historical and current concomitant anti-psychotic medication(s) or centrally acting anticholinergic agents that the subject has taken  on the corresponding eCRF 
page.

Confidential and Proprietary 59 18 June 2019 11.3. Efficacy Assessments  
11.3.1. Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms – Parkinson’s Disease (SAPS -PD) 
The Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms – Parkinson’s Disease ( SAPS-PD) is a 
Parkinson’s disease-adapted subset of nine items derived from the Scale for Assessment of 
Positive Symptoms (SAPS), including seven items assessing individual symptoms, a global hallucinations item and a global delusions item ( Cummings -2014). The items were selected 
based on their frequency and face validity. Principal component analysis was consistent with a 4-factor structure with delusions and visual, auditory and somatic delusions as distinct constructs (Voss-2013). The SAPS- PD will be performed for this study. 
The SAPS was originally developed for the assessment of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The SAPS assesses four symptom clusters (hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior, and positive formal thought disorder). The items assessed in each of these clusters are rated based on 
frequency, and the global score item in each cluster is based on both the frequency and extent to 
which symptoms disrupt functioning. 
For this study, the SAPS-PD will be administered by [CONTACT_10060], trained, and calibrated group 
of blinded Independent Central Raters. The Independent Central Raters will administer the 
SAPS-PD at study visits  3-[ADDRESS_471633] clinical experience with Parkinson’s disease patients and caregivers, hold an advanced 
medical or mental health degree and must successfully complete all applicable study -related 
training. In order to rate in the study, the Independent Central Rater must be vetted and approved by [CONTACT_376884], and must maintain valid Rater Certification on the SAPS- PD. 
Inter-rater reliability exercises will be conducted at regular intervals with recalibration  training 
provided as needed. 
11.3.2. Clinical Global Impressions – Severity Scale ( CGI-S) 
The Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale ( CGI-S) is a clinician -rated assessment of the 
subject’s current illness state on a 7 -point scale, where a higher score is associated with greater 
illness severity. Following a clinical interview, the CGI -S can be completed in 1  - 2 minutes 
(Guy-1976; Williams -2000). The CGI- S rating instrument will be performed by [CONTACT_376885] a 
paper version of the assessment. 
11.3.3. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)  
The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) ( Cummings-1994) is a 12 -item behavior rating scale 
composed of a structured interview of the caregiver, which assess psychiatric disturbance. In this 
study, the entire NPI [INVESTIGATOR_376826] a secondary outcome measure. 
Scores on Item  A (delusions) and Item B (hallucinations) will be considered as part of the 
inclusion criteria. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined.  
The NPI [CONTACT_832] a rater administered, structured interview administrated to caregivers of dementia patients. A gating question is asked about each sub-domain. If the responses to these questions indicate that the patient has problems with a particular sub -domain of behavior, the caregiver i s 
only then asked all the questions about that domain, rating the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale and their severity on a 3- point scale ( Cummings -1997).

11.3.4. Mini Mental Sta te Examination (MMSE) for Cognition 
The Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE) for Cognition ( Folstein-1975) is a brief instrument, 
used to assess cognitive function, consisting of 11 tests including orientation, memory (recent 
and immediate), concentration, language, and praxis. Scores range from [ADDRESS_471634] at Visits  1 and 2 (ie, prior t o first dose 
administration).  
Adverse events will be collected for each subject. Subjects should be queried in a non- leading 
manner, without specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since your last visit?”). See Section 12, Safety Reporting. 
11.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory tests required by [CONTACT_376886] 21, Appendix II . 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory tests. For detailed instructions 
regarding clinical laboratory procedures, sampling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_376828]. Samples will be processed at a central laboratory to ensure 
consistency. All clinical laboratories will be College of American Pathologists (CAP), Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and/or other laboratory certifications or equivalent accreditation documents.

Confidential and Proprietary 61 18 June 2019 rate should be collected at that time in the manner described above. Vital signs will be obtained 
prior to clinical laboratory collec tion and performance of an ECG. 
11.4.4. Electrocardiograms (E CGs) 
All ECGs will be obtained in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], after the subject has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes. ECGs wi ll be 12-lead with a 10-second rhythm strip. ECGs should be obtained 
prior to drawing blood samples. All attempts should be made to use the same ECG recorder for all visits within individ ual subjects. ECGs will be centrally read at a core lab according to 
established quality assurance procedures for inter/intra reader variability. Refer to  Section 20, 
Appendix I for additional information. ECG parameters to be collected include ventricular heart 
rate (beats/min), QT interval (msec), PR interval (msec), QRS interval (msec),  RR interval 
(msec), and overall ECG interpretation (Normal, Abnormal not clinically significant [ NCS], 
Abnormal clinically significant [ CS]). 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to perform a safety review of the ECG data for changes 
from previous assessments and/or emergent cardiac dysfunction, and to determine subjects’ 
eligibility for or continuance in the study. Abnormalities require comment as NCS or CS. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], CS designated events will be reported as adverse events.  
ECGs will be reviewed, signed and dated by [CONTACT_376887]. The 
same physician should review all ECG reports for a given subject whenever possible. 
The original ECG tracing will be kept with subject’s source documentation. A copy may be 
collected by [CONTACT_1034]. 
11.4.5. Physical and Neurological Examination 
A full PE as well as a neurological  examination  will be performed. The PE  includes an 
assessment of general appearance and a review of systems (de rmatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose, 
mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, 
extremities, musculoskeletal, neurol ogic, and psychiatric systems).  The neurological examination 
will include an assessment of menta l status, cranial nerves, motor and sensory systems, gait, and 
reflexes. 
All PE and neurological exam findings at screening will be captured in the medical history in the 
CRF. Any clinically significant changes from screening, as determined by [CONTACT_119576], will 
be noted as AEs in the CRF. 
11.4.6. Height, Weight, and BMI 
Weight will be measured in kilograms . Weight will be collected per the Schedule of A ssessments 
(see Table 2 and Table 3). H eight in meters will be record ed only at S creening. 
Height will be measured without shoes. 
Weight will be measured in street clothes, without shoes and coat/jacket.  
BMI will be calculated by [CONTACT_376888]  = weight  [kg]/height [m]²  at 
Screening only. BMI for all othe r visits will be derived within the Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) system.

Confidential and Proprietary 62 18 June 2019 11.4.7. Safety Scales  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) 
The Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) is a tool designed to systematically 
assess and track suicidal adver se events (suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the 
trial. The strength of this suicide classification system is in its ability to comprehensively identify 
suicidal events while limiting the over -identification of suicidal behavior. The scal e takes 
approximately 5  minutes to administer. The C-SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the 
site. Subjects with Type  4 or Type 5 suicidal ideation during the study will be discontinued from 
the study and referred to a mental health professional ( Posner-2007). At screening visit, 
“Baseline/Screening ” version of C- SSRS will be used. For all visits from Visit [ADDRESS_471636], the 
“Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS will be used. 
11.5. Population Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
All blood samples for determination of plasma SEP-[ADDRESS_471637] be recorded 
on Day 43 when blood samples are collected for determination of plasma SEP-363856 and 
SEP-363854 concentrations. Plasma SEP-363856 and SEP-363854 concentrations will be 
determined by a validated liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) 
method. POPPK analysis will be performed using plasma SEP-363856 concentrations; the results 
of which will be reported separately.  The relationship between SAPS-PD total scor e and plasma 
SEP-363856 exposure will be explored using population PK/pharmacodynamics methods, and 
reported separately.  The impact of cytochrome (CYP) P450 CYP2D6 metabolizer status on 
SEP-363856 plasma exposure will be explored and reported separately. See Section 22, 
Appendix III for details including instructions of processing blood samples to plasma  for 
SEP-363856 and SEP -363854 concentrations. 
11.6. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Assessment  
The relationship betwe en SAPS- PD total score and plasma SEP -363856 exposure will be 
explored using population PK/pharmacodynamics methods, and reported separately. 
11.7. Pharmacogenomic  Assessment s 
If a subject and/or legally authorized representative have consented to have a deoxyri bonucleic 
acid (DNA) sample taken for genetic analysis (and is eligible for randomi zation), a blood sample 
(approximately 4 mL) for pharmacogenetic (PGx) analysis will be taken at Visit 3 (Baseline).  
Samples should not be collected if the subject and /or legally authorized representative have not 
consented to PGx sampling. If samples are collected for analysis, this analysis must be performed. The timing of the analysis may be following completion of this study and as such can be reported separately. Blood samples will be shipped to the central laboratory where they will 
be stored frozen until shipment to the PGx laboratory (contact [CONTACT_376889]). Following shipm ent, DNA will be extracted and the 
PGx laboratory will remain blinded to the identity of the subject, but will have access to 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.[ADDRESS_471638] (ethnic origin and gender). The impact of 
cytochrome (CYP) P450 CYP2D6 metabolizer status on SEP-363856 plasma exposure will be 
explored and reported separately. See Section 23, Appendix IV for details including instructions 
of PGx sample handling.

11.8.1. Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson’s Disease for Nighttime Sle ep Quality 
(SCOPA-NS) and Daytime Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (SCOPA -DS) 
The Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson’s D isease Sleep Scale (SCOPA) is a self -administered , 
validated short questionnaire that is used to assess nighttime sleep (NS) problems and daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (DS ) in subjects with Parkinson’s disease. It takes about [ADDRESS_471639] month and includes 5 items with 4  response options 
ranging from 0  (not at all) to 3  (a lot). The maximum score of this subscale is 15, with higher 
scores reflecting more severe sleep problems. One additional question evaluates overall sleep 
quality on a 7-point scale (ranging from slept very well to slept very badly). The score on this 
item is not included in the score of the NS scale  but is used separately as a global measure of 
sleep quality. The DS subscale evaluates DS in the past month and includes 6 items with 
4 response options, ranging from 0 (never) to 3  (often). The maximum score is  18, with higher 
scores reflecting more severe sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ( Marinus-2003). 
The SCOPA -DS and SCOPA -NS rating assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_137610] a 
paper version of the assessment. 
11.8.2. Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Parts 2 and 3 (UPDRS II and 
UPDRS III) 
The Unified Parkinson’s Dis ease Rating Scale (Fahn-1987) is a scale used to follow the 
longitudinal course of Parkinson’s disease. From the original scale, only parts II (Activities of 
Daily Living) and III (Motor Examination) will be performed in this study. Part II records 
historical information from the past seven days as how the patient functioned in various activities 
of daily living. The UPDRS Part  III is an objective motor assessm ent at the time of evaluation. 
All items from both parts are scored on a 5- point scale (0  - 4) with higher scores indicating 
higher severity. The same study site rater should perform both parts’ assessments for a given subject whenever possible. The UPDRS rating assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_376885] a paper version of the assessments.  
11.8.3. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire (RBDQ)  
The REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire (RBD Q) is a 10-item patient self -rated 
questionnaire addressing the clinical manifestations of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD). 
Questions are br ief and answered “yes” or “no ,” with a maximum total score of 13. Items 1  - 4 
assess the frequency and content of dreams and their relationship to nocturnal movements and 
other behavior. Item 5 inquires about self-injuries and injuries to the bed partner. Item 6 assesses 
specific nocturnal motor behaviors, items 7 and 8 address nocturnal awakenings, item 9 assesses disturbed sleep in general and item 10 queries the presence of any neurological disorder (Stiasny-Kolster-2007, Cummings -2014).

Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 73 18 June 2019 12. SAFETY R EPORTING  
12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between the time of signing the ICF and first drug 
administration are pre -treatment events. Those that occur after first administration of study drug 
are considered AEs.  
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre- existing conditions. 
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, mode rate, 
or severe myocardial infarction)  (see Section 12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious," which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning as defined by [CONTACT_29967]. 
During the study, if a subject  has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (eg, elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens durin g the study, it should be reported 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 74 18 June 2019 as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal objective find ings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG value, and 
physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recorded as 
the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the sign 
(eg, clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdominal pain) as the AE. 
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of  uncertain causality may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. Laboratory reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_737]. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests Outside the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal range will be 
flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the study center. The 
Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical 
significance.  Additional testing during the study may be done if medically indicated. If a 
clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the Follow-Up Visit, this should be recorded as an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalised or stabilised.  
All on-site ECG tracings and ECG over -read reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The 
Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG s. ECG with possibly 
drug-related or clinically relevant abnormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any 
abnormal ECGs that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_737]. 
12.3. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
Pretreatment events will be collected and recorded from the time informed consent is provided up to the time of the first dose of study drug administration (ie, at Visit 1  and Visit 2). AEs will 
be collected and recor ded from after first administration of study drug to the last study visit (ie, 
Visit 2 [postdose] to Visit 13 and unscheduled visits). 
All pre-treatment events and AEs must be recorded in the subject’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investigat or’s normal clinical practice. All pre -treatment 
events and all AEs must be recorded on the CRF. 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.[ADDRESS_471644] to follow-up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency, seriousness,  action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy treatment. Definitions for severity , 
frequency, action taken with the study treatment, outcome, and  causal relationship to the s tudy 
treatment  are presented below.  
The severity  of AE: 
• Mild – Ordinarily transient symptoms that do not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Other treatment is not ordinarily indicated. 
• Moderate – Marked sympto ms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities. Other treatment may 
be necessary.  
• Severe – Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s 
daily activities. May be  unable to continue the s tudy, and other treatment may be 
necessary.  
The frequency  of AE: 
• Once – an isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
• Intermittent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.  
• Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The action taken  with the study treatment: 
• Drug Interrupted  – Study drug stopped temporarily. 
• Drug Withdrawn  – Study drug stopped permanently. 
• Dose Reduced.  
• Dose Increased.  
• Dose Not Changed.  
• Not Applicable.  
• Unknown  
The outcome of the AE: 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering /Resolving  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Fatal 
• Unknown  
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 76 18 June 2019 The causal relationship of the AE to the s tudy treatment: 
• Not related  
−  Not related  – Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to other 
drugs or underlying disease.  
• Related 
− Possible – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but 
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
− Probable  – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is 
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there is a 
plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug. 
− Definite – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_29969]. The adverse event should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge; however, this is not mandatory before assigning a definite causality.  
The Medical Monitor is the initial contact [CONTACT_376892]. The contact [CONTACT_29971] [ADDRESS_471645] be immediately reported to  the Sponsor: 
• SAE 
• Pregnancy  
Emergency contact [CONTACT_29972] 1. 
12.4.1. Serious Adverse Event  
If the Investigator or study center staff becomes aware of a SAE that occurs in a study subject 
after first administration o f study drug through [ADDRESS_471646] be recorded on the CRF and the data recorded should agree with that on 
the SAE form.  In addition, pretreatment events that meet the definition of serious 
(Section 12.1.2) should be reported following the same guidelines. 
Following the end of subject participation in the s tudy, the Investigator or an authorized delegate 
should report SAEs “spontaneously” to [COMPANY_003] -pharmacovigilance ( PVG) if considered at least 
possibly related to the s tudy drug. 
SAEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the event 
is otherwise explained.  
An initial or follow-up SAE form as applicable must be completed and signed and sent via fax or 
email (see Table 1) to [COMPANY_003] -PVG within [ADDRESS_471647] be signed by [CONTACT_376893]. [COMPANY_003] -PVG provides the SAE form used to report SAEs. 
The Sponsor or designee will promptly notify all study centers and Investigators of an SAE that 
is determined to be expedited to the Regulatory Authorities  in accordance with  applicable law (s) 
and regulation(s ). These SAEs must be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) by [CONTACT_376894] r equired per IRB/IEC guidelines . 
12.4.2. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies  that occur from the time th at informed consent is signed through [ADDRESS_471648] (or female partner of male subject) will be 
instructed to return promptly/within [ADDRESS_471649] notification of pregnancy to the study center and undergo a serum/urine pregnancy test, as confirmation of pregnancy. If positive, the 
female pregnant subject will no longer receive any additional study drug . All pregnancies, 
whether or not the subject received any additional study drug, will be followed until resolution 
(ie, termination [voluntary or spontaneous] or birth). 
To report a pregnancy, the Pregnancy Event Form must be completed and sent via fax to 
[COMPANY_003]-PVG within  [ADDRESS_471650] FROM 
STUDY/DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG  
13.1. Criteria for Study Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects may be discontinued from the study drug at any time for any of the following reasons: 
• Adverse event  
• Lack of efficacy (specify)  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] (specify)  
• Non-compliance with study drug (specify) 
• Protocol deviation (specify)  
• Death 
• Progressive disease  
• Pregnancy  
• Other (specify)  
If at any time during the course of the study, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject may 
no longer safely participate due to a change in medical status (eg, experiences an AE, becomes 
pregnant), the subject must be discontinued from the study drug. 
The reason and information on the epoch for study drug discontinuation will be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF. In case of death, the date of death should be captured on the CRF. 
13.2. Clinical Assessments After Study Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects who have not received study drug will not be followed up on leaving the s tudy. 
For subjects who have received study drug and who prematurely discontinue from the study 
treatment (ie, do not complete through Visit 13), every effort should be made to complete the 
final evaluation procedures, in accordance with the early termination (ET)  visit described in 
Section 11.9.9. 
Subjects who receive study drug  will complete a follow up visit 7 (± 2) days  after the last visit to 
assess any post study discontinuation adverse effects as described in Section 11.9.10. 
 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 79 18 June 2019 14. STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the s tudy at  this study center or at multiple centers 
for safety  or administrative reasons at any time  while safeguarding that early termination does 
not compromise subjects’ safety or well- being. In particular, a study center that does not recruit 
at an acceptable rate may be closed . Should the study be terminated and/or the study center 
closed for whatever  reason, all documentation and study drugs pertaining to the study must be 
returned to the Sponsor or its representative.  
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site termination, subjects will undergo final evaluation procedures, in 
accordance with the early termination (ET) visit described in Section 11.9.4 and safety follow-up 
visit as described in Section  11.9.10. 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 80 18 June 2019 15. STATISTICS  
15.1. Sample Size  
A total of approximately  36 subjects will be randomized in 2:1  ratio to SEP-363856 and placebo, 
with approximately 24 subjects assigned to SEP-363856 and 12 subjects assigned to placebo. 
The sample size will provide powers of 59%, 48%, 37%, and 27% to detect treatment effect sizes 
of 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5, respectively, in change from Baseline in SAPS- PD at Week [ADDRESS_471651] method 
with 2-sided significant level of 0.05. The sample size was determined for the purposes of 
exploring the efficacy, safety and tolerability of flexible dosing with SEP -363856 (25, 50, or 
75 mg/day) for 6 weeks in male and female subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PDP. A 
sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to ensure 36 randomized subjects. 
15.2. Analysis Populations  
15.2.1. Modified Intention -to-Treat Population  
The modified intention -to-treat (mITT) population will consist of all subjects who are 
randomized, have received at least one dose of study drug, and have a Baseline and at least one 
post-Baseline efficacy measurement  during the DB treatment period . The mITT population will 
be the primary popul ation for the efficacy analyse s. Subjects will be analy zed according to 
randomised treatment group. 
15.2.2. Per Protocol Population  
The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all m ITT population subjects who satisfy the 
following conditions: 
• Received assigned study medication as randomized 
• Have 14 days or more continuous exposure 
• Have 75% - 125% compliance, both limit values inclusive 
• Have no major protocol violations, determined by a blinded data review prior to 
database lock  
Selected efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the PP population. 
15.2.3. Safety Population 
The safety population will consist of all subjects who are randomized and have received at least 
one dose of study drug during the DB treatment period . Safety population will be the primary 
population  for the safety analyses.  Subjects will be analysed according to the actual treatment 
received (ie, placebo vs SEP-363856). 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.[ADDRESS_471652] one dose of 
study drug during the 12- week open -label extension period. The OL extension  safety population 
will be used for the long- term safety, tolerability, and efficacy analyses. All the by -treatment 
summaries will be based on the treatment received during the DB perio d (i.e. SEP-363856   
SEP-363856 vs. Placebo   SEP-363856). Changes from baseline in all safety  measures will be 
summarized at each scheduled post -baseline extension visit, based on both the DB baseline and 
the OL baseline.  
15.3. Data Analysis 
15.3.1. Subject Disposition  
Subject disposition during the DB treatment period will be summarized by [CONTACT_376895] (if applicable) and overall for all subjects. The number and percentage of 
subjects who are screened , screen-failed, randomized, and completed or discontinued the study 
(including reasons for discontinuation) will be presented. 
Subject disposition during the OL extension  period will be summarized and presented for the 
number and percentage of subjects, who entered the extension period, received at least one dose 
of the extension study treatment, and completed or discontinued the study (including reasons for 
discontinuation). 
15.3.2. Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Drug exposure and compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_376896]-blind and double-blind period, and for the OL extension  safety population for the open-
label extension period.  
Drug exposure (in  days) will be calculated as: last dose date - first dose date + 1. Exposure will 
be summarized both as a continuous variable fo r the single-blind, double-blind period, and 
OL extension  period (ie, mean days), and categorically . 
For double-blind: 
• Number and percentage of subjects with  drug exposure ≥ 4, ≥ 7, ≥ 14, ≥ 21, ≥ 28, 
≥ 35 and ≥ 42 days ; 
• Number and percentage of subjects with drug exposure for 1 - 3, 4 - 6, 7 - 13, 14 - 20, 
21 - 27, 28 - 34, 35 - 41 and ≥ 42 days  
For OL extension : 
• Number and percentage of subjects with extension study drug exposure ≥ 1, ≥ 7, ≥ 14, 
≥ 21, ≥ 28, ≥ 56, and  ≥ 84 days;  
• Number and percentage of subjects with extension study drug exposure for 1 - 6, 7 - 13, 14 - 20, 21 - 27, 28 - 55, 56 - 83, and  ≥ 84 days 
Percent compliance will be calculated by [CONTACT_376897]-blind period as: 
(number of capsules taken / num ber of capsules should have been taken ) × 100%. 
Non-compliance is defined as less than 75% or more than 125% non- missing compliance for the 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 82 18 June 2019 double-blind period. Subjec ts with missing compliance will not be classified as non- compliant.  
Compliance will be summarized both as a cont inuous variable (i e, mean percentage)  and 
categorically (ie, number and percentage of subjects who are compliant vs. non-compliant, or 
with compliance < 75%, 75% - 125%, > 125%, and missing). Similarly, percent compliance will 
be calculated, and summarized  both as a continuous variable and categorically for the entire 
open-label extension period. 
Mean daily dose will be calculated for the entire open -label extension period as the cumulative 
dose (mg) of SEP-363856 divided by [CONTACT_376898] (in days), where cumulative dose 
is the sum of all doses a subject received during the open-label extension period. Modal daily dose will be determined as the daily dose that is taken for the most time (in terms of number of 
days) among all doses taken during the OL  extension  period. Both mean daily dose and modal 
daily dose will be summarized.  
15.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of potentially IPDs. The potentially IPDs will be ide ntified through programmatic checks of s tudy 
data, as well as through review of selected data listings. The potentially IPDs to be reviewed 
include, but are not limited to, subjects who: 
•Did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.
•Received any disallowed co ncomitant medication.
•Have overall double-blind compliance rate < 75% or > 125%.
Individual IPDs will be presented for all randomized subjects in a data listing. The number and 
percentage of subjects in the mITT population with IPDs will be summarized by [CONTACT_376899]. 
15.3.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Basic demographic s (eg, age, gender, race, ethnicity , etc.) will be summarized for all screened 
subjects, by [CONTACT_250154] (ie,  randomized vs. not randomized), and for subjects who 
entered the OL  extension  period. Demographic and Baseline characteristics  will be summarized 
for the mITT population and safety population, as well as for the OL  extension  safety population. 
Selected data (e.g. weight, BMI, SA PS-PD total score, NPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], etc.) will be summarized at 
both the double-blind (DB) baseline and the open- label (OL) baseline of study.  
Medical history  will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)

15.3.5. Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
This section describes the primary analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint. Sensitivity analysis 
of this endpoint is described in Section  15.3.12. 
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 83 18 June 2019 The primary efficacy variable is the change from baseline in SAPS-PD score at Week  6 during 
the DB period for testing superiority of SEP-363856 to placebo. A Mixed Model for Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) will be used for this comparison. The MMRM model will include factors for 
treatment, vis it (as a categorical variable), and treatment -by-visit interaction, and include 
baseline SAPS-PD score as a covariate. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used for the 
within-subject correlation and the Kenward -Rogers approximation will be used to ca lculate the  
denominator degree of freedom. 
The primary analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on the observed data only. 
Missing observations will not be imputed.

CGI-S score 
Change from Baseline in CG I-S score at Week  [ADDRESS_471654]- baseline extension 
visit, based on both the DB baseline and the OL baseline. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
Data from SCOPA -NS, SCOPA -DS, and UPDRS  II and III, will be analyzed similarly.  
The total score and change from baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_376900]. Change from baseline at Week  6 will be analyzed by [CONTACT_376901] 
(ANCOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect, and baseline score as a covari ate.  
The absolute values o f the other efficacy measures  at both the DB baseline and OL baseline, and 
at each scheduled post -baseline extension visit, will be summarized descriptively. Changes from 
baseline in these measures  will be summarized at each scheduled post -baseline extensi on visit, 
based on both the DB baseline and the OL baseline. 
The absolute values of SAPS- PD score at both the DB baseline and OL baseline, and at each

For the MMRM models, no imputation for missing data will be applied unless otherwise specified.  
Protocol SEP361-203, Version 6.[ADDRESS_471657]  (LOCF) method, and the dat a will be analyzed using an ANCOVA 
model. The respective response variable for the model will be: change from Baseline in 
SAPS-PD total score at the Week  [ADDRESS_471658] SAPS -PD total score (or CGI -S 
score) measured. Mean change from Baseline in SAPS -PD total score and mean change from 
Baseline in CGI -S score will be plotted by [CONTACT_376910], in order to assess whether these two efficacy measures appear to be correlated with study dropout. 
The mechanisms that cause missing data may or ma y not be at random. The MMRM model used 
in the primary analysis of the two efficacy endpoints above relies on the assumption of missing 
at random (MAR). In order to explore the robustness of the primary analyses, sensitivity 
analyses, such as a random effe cts pattern mixture model and a pattern mixture model with 
placebo-based multiple imputation, may be performed for these two efficacy endpoints. Details 
of these analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
No sensitivity analyses are planned for the OL extension  period.

ASSURANCE
16.1. Data Collection/ Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
For enrolled subjects , the results from Screening and data collected during the study (except 
clinical laboratory test results)  will be recorded in the subject’s electronic CRF.  Screen failed 
subjects will have a limited number of required electronic CRFs. Data will be entered into source 
documents prior to being transcribed into the CRF. This transcribing will be done once a subject 
has passed screening ( Visit 1). The study centers will use an EDC system that is compliant with 
relevant FDA regulatory requirements per 21 Code of F ederal Regulations ( CFR) Part 11. 
Password protected access to the EDC system will be via a secure website. Data queries and data corrections will be handled through the same system. All transactions within the EDC system are fully documented within an electronic audit trail. Each set of completed CRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed  and dated by [CONTACT_113118].

Labor
atory reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_376918] 1572 (MD or DO). Laboratory test results will be reviewed by t he Investigator as 
they become available. The Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all out-of-range lab values (except drug screens). Possibly drug- related or clinically relevant 
abnormal values of uncertain causality must be repeated. Any abnormal values that persist 
should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator.

SAMPLE  HANDLING  GUIDELINE
Please refer to the Laboratory Investigator Manual for all collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
BLOOD SAMPLES FOR PLASMA PHARMACOKINETICS  
When blood sample for PK assessment and clinical lab sample collections share the same 
designated time points (including predose sample), the blood samples should be collected during 
the same venipuncture. 
For each defined PK sampling time point, collect [ADDRESS_471665] plasma sample with approximately equal volume into 
2 polypropylene tubes, and label as Primary and Ba ck-up. Freeze plasma tubes in a freezer set at 
approximately -20°C or lower. The date and clock time of blood collection must be recorded. 
Blood must be collected from all subjects at the time points indicated below.  
All samples will be shipped with  sufficient dry ice protection. 
Study Day  Collection Time  Volume Collected  
Day 1 Predose (approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing) 
and [ADDRESS_471666] dose 6 mL each 
Day 43 Day 43 (12 ± 4 hours after the Day  42 dose). Actual 
date and clock time will be recorded.  6 mL

Please refer to the Laboratory Investigator Manual for all collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].  
BLOOD SAMPLES FOR PHARMACOGENOMICS  
•A blood sample (approximately 4.0 mL) will be collected predose on Day  1 using a
4-mL Vacutainer® (or equivalent) collection tube containing K2- EDTA as an
anticoagulant.
•The tubes containing blood samples will be labeled with the following information:
unique barcode (if possible), protocol number, subject number, and sample date ofcollection .
•Blood samples will be kept upright on wet ice upon blood draw and will be storedfrozen at approximately -70°C within 10 min of collection until shipment to the
appropriate laboratory.
•The blood samples for pharmacogenomics will be shipped in leak-proof double-plastic sealed bags with approximately 20  pounds of dry ice placed in insulated
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_376838] “Human Specimens/Non-infectious”.Packing material such as bubble-wrap or other cushioni ng material will be placed
around the samples to prevent breakage during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Samples will be shipped inconformance with International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulationsrelating to the handling an d shippi[INVESTIGATOR_173562].
•Samples will be shipped via Sponsor-specified overnight courier service on Mondaythrough Wednesday (should be shipped at least 2 days prior to National Holiday) .

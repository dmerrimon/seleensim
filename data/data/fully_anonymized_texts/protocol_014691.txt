V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page [ADDRESS_472803] well -researched example of this is the accelerated decline in bone mineral density (BMD) due to  the 
decline in ovarian estrogens at the menopause. Restoring normal e strogen levels can effectively mitigate 
menopause -related skeletal changes , but eventually other non-gonadal aging factors trigger a decline in BMD .[ADDRESS_472804] of the loss of gonadal function on physical activity in a number of animal species is startling . 
Ovariectomy (OVX) causes a 30% to 80 % decrease  in physical activity (Fig 1)2-[ADDRESS_472805] (65% decreas e).8 Physical activity levels do not 
return to normal spontaneously in gonadectomized animals, but full rescue occurs with estrogen treatment in 
females (Fig 2) and t estosterone treatment in ma les. The loss of gonadal function in humans may also trigger  a 
decline in physical activity. Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH AG) therapy to suppress gonadal 
function causes an increase in fat mass;9-11 these studies did not evaluate whether the disruption of energy 
balance was due to a decline in  physical activity . Observational studies of women through the menopausal 
transition indicate that fat gain accelerates 3 to 4 years before ovarian failure. To our knowledge, only one 
prospective study  included an objective measure of physical  activity and found a 55% decreas e over the final 
3 peri-menopausal years  (Fig 6 ).[ADDRESS_472806] cancer, 
depression, low cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_377697], and increased  body mass .13 
The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a controlled intervention  strategy  to determine whether the 
suppression of ovarian function in women approaching the menopause causes a marked decline in phys ical 
activity.  Additional  goals are  to assess changes in other components of energy balance , determine whether the 
disruption of energy balance is associated with changes in biomarkers of chronic disease risk, and determine 
whether programmed exercise can prevent these changes . To achieve these aims, women aged 42 to 52  
years with normal menstrual cycle function will be randomize d to receive  24 weeks  of placebo, GnRH AG, or 
GnRH AG+exercise  intervention . Specific aims (SA) and hypotheses (H)  are: 
Primary SA1:   Determine whether 24 weeks  of GnRH AG therapy causes a decline in physical activity when 
compared  with placebo. Change in physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE ) from baseline will be 
measur ed after 12 (secondary  outcome ) and 24 wk  (primary  outcome) o f GnRH AG vs placebo therapy. PAEE 
will be the difference between total daily EE (TEE) measured by [CONTACT_377731] -labeled w ater technique (DLW) 
and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_88158] (S EE) measured by [CONTACT_46146] , adjusted for the thermic effect of feeding (TEF) .14 
H1: PAEE will decrease significantly after 12 and 24 weeks of GnRH AG therapy when compared with placebo.  
Secondary SA2:  Determine the effects of gonadal function on multiple components  of energy expenditure  
under free -living (DLW) and controlled (metabolic chamber) conditions , includin g 1) 24 -h TEE measured by 
[CONTACT_377732], and 2) resting EE ( REE), SEE, and  TEF measured by [CONTACT_377733] a metabolic chamber . 
H2:  When compared with placebo, GnRH AG therapy will cause a  decrease in TEE . The relative contributions 
of REE, S EE, TEF, and PAEE to the decline in TEE  will be evaluated.  
Secondary SA3 : Determine whether the disruption of  energy balance in response to GnRH AG therapy leads to 
unfavorable changes in biomarkers of disease risk, including adiposity, insulin resistance , and inflammation . 
This will include the  measurement of biomarkers in adipose tissue samples.  
H3: When compared with placebo, GnRH AG therapy will cause increases in  adiposity, insulin  resistance , and 
fasted serum inflammatory cytokines .  
Secondary SA4 : Because programmed exercise mitigates metab olic consequences of gonadectomy in 
animals, we will d etermine whether the bioenergetic and metabolic consequences of GnRH AG in women can be 
 COMIRB# 12 -1157  
V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page 3 of 28 mitigat ed through a programmed, supervised exercise intervention (GnRH AG vs GnRH AG+exercise).  
H4: Programmed exercise will attenuate the decrease in TEE and the increases in adiposity, insulin resistance, 
and inflammatory cytokines.  
Exploratory Aim: To evaluate the effects of chronic sex hormone suppression  and exercise on arterial 
stiffness and endoth elial function. This preliminary data will be used for a new grant application examining the 
effects of exercise on modulating vascular function in E2 -deficient women.  
 
2. Research Strategy  
2.a. Significance  
Physical activity and disease risk. The evidence report for the [ADDRESS_472807] 
that older adults, and specifically 
older women, may be at in creased 
chronic disease risk because of 
inadequate physical activity.  The 
reasons for sex differences and age -
related changes in physical activity are 
not clear. There are well -described sex- 
and age -related differences in such 
physiological factors as muscle strength 
and aerobic power that would explain 
why the absolute intensity  or volume 
(e.g., kcal/d) of physical activity would be 
lower in women than men and decline 
with aging.17 However, the trend and 
prevalence estimates discussed 
above15,16 were based on the time spent 
participa ting in physical activity , and 
there is no obvious biological reason why 
this should be different between women 
and men or decline with  age. Because 
leisure -time physical activity is typi[INVESTIGATOR_377698], it is possible that 
women simply choose to be less active 
than men and that adults choose to 
become less active as they age.  
However, it is also possible that there are 
biological regulators of physical activity.18 
Gonadal r egulation of physical activity  – 
preclinical evidence . There is compelling 
evidence from studies of laboratory 
animals that spontaneous physical 
activity is regulated by [CONTACT_377734],

V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page 4 of 28 and specifically by [CONTACT_226729]. Figure 1 summarizes the 
results of  several recent preclinical  studies of the effects of 
OVX on physical activity. When compared with  animals with 
normal ovarian function (intact; solid dark red bars), OVX 
(solid light gray bars) resulted in a dramatic  decline in 
physical activity  of 30% to 80% that was not attribu table to 
the effects of surgery.  Further, physical activity was rescued 
in OVX animals treated with estradiol (E 2; hatched bars) .2-7 
The regulation of physical activity by E2, specifically, in 
female animals is further supported by [CONTACT_377736] 
E2, but not progesterone, restored  normal activity in OVX 
animals  (Fig 2).7 Although the gonadal regulation of physical 
activity has received less attention in male animals  than 
females , orchiectomy (ORX) was reported to reduce voluntary wheel -running 
activity as dramatically as OVX (~65%) and normal levels we re restored by 
[CONTACT_377737] .8 
Sex differences in b ioenergetic consequences of the loss of gonadal fun ction 
– preclinical evidence.   One consequence of OVX  in laboratory animals is 
excess  weight gain .2-7 For example, the mean body weight of OVX mice was 
approximately 20% higher than sham controls 12 wk  after surgery.3 The 
disruption in energy balance following OVX may be mediated by [CONTACT_377738]  (Fig 1) ,2-7 but also a decrease in metabolic rate  
that is independent of the decline in activity3 and, in some species, an  
increase in  energy intake (EI).[ADDRESS_472808], been found to significantly 
reduce body weight.23 Even  a 65% decrease in wheel -running activity 
in response to ORX  did not result in an increase in body weight.8 The 
sex dimorphism in the effects of gonadectomy  on fat mass mirror s the 
effects on body mass (Fig 3) .23 There is also evidence that the 
abdominal visceral fat depot expands markedly in response to 
gonadectomy in females (Fig 4),24 but this does not occur in males.19 
These findings indicate that the bioenergetic consequences of the 
loss of gonadal function are markedly different in female rodents 
than in males. The loss of E2 appears to  be the mechanistic trigger  in 
females , because E2 therapy mitigates  the decline in physical activity 
(Fig 1) and the increase in visceral fat mass (Fig 4).  Exercise has also 
been found to attenuate the gain in visceral fat in OVX animals (Fig 4). 
Because of the apparent sex differences in the bioene rgetic 
response to gonadectomy and the constrained resources of the 
UCAMC SCOR, the clinical project will focus on women only . 
Based on the preclinical evidence  discussed above , we postulate that 
the loss of ovarian function will lead to a marked decline  in physical 
activity and an increase in total and abdominal adiposity . 
Benefits of programmed exercise . The effects of OVX to  decrease 
physical activity and  increase adiposity , leading to metabolic 
dysfunction , can be largely counteracted with programmed exercise 
(e.g., treadmill exercise).25-29 For example, the exaggerated increases 
in visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, and insulin resistance that occur in 
OVX (Fig 5, middle solid bars) compar ed with sham rats ( left solid bars) 
are largely prevented in OVX rats that perform treadmill exercise 
(middle hatched bars).[ADDRESS_472809] benefits occu r in OVX animals 
treated with both E 2 and exercise ( right hatched bars). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_377699], g

Is there evidence for gonadal  regulation of  
physical activity  in women ? The European 
Society of Human Reproduction and 
Embryology (ESHRE) workshop in 2010 on 
perimenopausal  risk factors and future health31 
report ed that “body weight increases because 
the decline in physical activity during the 
perimenopause is greater than the concomitant 
decline in energy intake.”  However, based on 
the information in the report and to our 
knowledge, only one prospective cohort 
study  has reported  changes in physical activity 
and energy intake  (along with body 
composition, fat distribution, and energy 
balance)  over the menopausal transi tion.12 
Lovejoy and colleagues conducted annual 
study visits over 4 years in 129 women aged 43 
years or older with normal menstrual cycle 
function. By [CONTACT_68089] 4, 51 women were 
postmenopausal, 44 were perimenopausal,  and 
34 remained premenopausal. Physical activity 
was assessed objectively at each annual visit  
by [CONTACT_377739] o ver 4 consecutive days ; food records were obtained simultaneously  for the 
estimation of energy intake.  Over the 4  years before women became menopausal,  the average  physical 
activity level decreased by [CONTACT_726] 50%  (Fig 6 , bottom left).  Energy intake also decreased ~30%  
(bottom right), but not to a sufficient extent to prevent a g ain in body weight ( upper left) and an increase in 
body f at (~5% of body mass; not shown).  There was also a striking increase in abdominal visceral fat area over 
the 4 year s leading up to menopause (Fig 6 , upper right). In a subset of women, TEE and SEE measured in a 
room calorimeter tended to decrease more in w omen who became menopausal than in those who remained 
premenopausal. These findings suggest that relatively large reductions in energy intake during the 
menopausal transition do not sufficiently counter the decrease in physical activity to prevent excess 
abdominal fat gain.  The proposed study will det ermine whether programmed exercise is an effective strategy 
for maintaining energy balance.  
Additional evidence for gonadal regulation of bioenergetics in women.  There is considerable evidence, as 
recently reviewed,32,33 that energy balance is disrupted in postmenopausal women in a manner that in creases 
the propensity for weight gain and fat gain , particularly in the abdominal region . Evidence that this is mediated 
specifically by [CONTACT_377740], as  in rodents, comes from the Postmenopausal Estrogen Progestin 
Intervention (PEPI) trial.34 Women randomized to menopausal hormone therapy (HT) in the PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_377701] [ADDRESS_472811] girth than placebo -treated women. Although there 
were no significant differences between estrogen -only and estrogen+progestin HT, women on estrogen -only 
HT had the smallest gains in weight and waist size.  Meta -analyses of randomized controlled trials of HT vs 
placebo indicate that HT has favorable effects on abdominal adiposity and insulin resistance.[ADDRESS_472812] also found that acute, 
short -term suppression of ovarian function results in a significant decline in  REE (Preliminary Data, Fig 8) .37 
However, if body weight increases with more prolonged suppression of ovarian function, REE could potentially 
increase.  
Significance – summary.  The NIH defines the significance of a project by [CONTACT_377741], methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative inte rventions that drive the  
field.  The proposed project ranks high i n these areas of significance. If we find that the suppression  of ovarian

2.b. Innovation  
The NIH -defined determinants of innovation include whether the application 1) will shift current research or 
clinical practice paradigms by [CONTACT_377742], approaches, instrumentation, or 
interventions; 2) advances concepts, approaches, instrumentation, or interventions that are novel ; or 3) 
involves a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches, instrumentation, 
or interventions.  The primary innovation of the current application is that it will be the first study to evaluate 
the gonadal regulation of physical activity in women using a randomized controlled intervention 
approach . Although the re is solid preclinical  evidence for the  regulation of spontaneous physical activity by 
[CONTACT_377735] , this is a novel theoretical concept in the clinical research community.  The proposed study will provide 
proof -of-concept evidence for the gonadal regulation of physical activity in w omen.  If the hypotheses are 
upheld, this is expected to stimulate novel research on the 1) mechanisms by [CONTACT_377743], 2) the health consequences of a menopause -related decline in physical activity, and 3) strategies 
(i.e., behavioral and pharmacologic) to prevent the bioenergetic and metabolic consequences of gonadal  
aging . Another innovative aspect of the proposal is that it will utilize state -of-the-science technologies  to 
measure the effects of GnRH AG therapy on energy ba lance under both free -living conditions (i.e., over  10 days 
by [CONTACT_377732]) and well -controlled conditions (i.e., over [ADDRESS_472814] calorimetry). The measurement of the 
components of TEE under well -controlled conditions will provide insight into whether th ere are decreases in EE 
in response to a controlled glucose challenge (TEF), a controlled exercise challenge (exercise EE), while at 
rest (REE), and during sleep (SEE).  
2.c. Preliminary data  
This section  will a) highlight the experience of the investigator s and their  long-standing interest in estrogen s as 
a mediator of energy ba lance and metabolism in women; b ) present preliminary evidence for the potential 
regulation of energy balance by [CONTACT_377744];  c) document  the precision of measurement of EE; and d ) 
demonstrate the ability of the investigators to successfully carry out an intensive intervention trial involving 
pharmacologic and behavioral interventions and a relatively burdensome testing schedule.  
Experience of the investigators . The PI, [CONTACT_290721], has been conducting trials involving exercise, hormone, 
and/or nutrition interventions in young and older adults for more than [ADDRESS_472815] been working together for 10 years through  their roles 
as director and associate director, respectively, of the Energy Balance Core Laborato ry (EBL) , which is a 
component of the Nutrition and Obesity Research Center (NORC). [CONTACT_377795] maintains the metabolic 
chamber , a resource supported by [CONTACT_377745], which utilizes state -of-the-science technology to measure [ADDRESS_472816] documented experience with  all of the proposed procedures with the 
exception of the meas urement of TEE by [CONTACT_377732] ([CONTACT_377795] is currently using DLW in an R01 -supported 
study). Because the DLW technique will be used to generate the primary outcome of the study (PAEE), we 
have enlisted [CONTACT_377796] from the University of Wisconsin as a consultant for the project. [CONTACT_377797] 
developed the DLW approach to measure TEE in humans nearly 20 years ago59 and is internationally 
 COMIRB# 12 -1157  
V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page [ADDRESS_472817] in this area was generated by a 
serendipi[INVESTIGATOR_377702] a study of the interactive 
effects of exercise and HT on bone mineral density 
(BMD).39  In that study, postmenopausal women who 
were assigned to HT (n=16) or no therapy (n=18) had 
similar reductions in fat mass (Fig 7 , left panel, solid 
bars) and waist girth (right panel, solid bars) in 
response to a supervised exercise intervention. 
Women continued the hormone intervention for 6 
months after the cessation of the exercise program. 
During that 6-month interval  (Fig 7 , hatched bars) , women 
not on HT gained back most of the fat mass and waist girth  
they had lost. In contrast, reductions in fat mass and waist 
girth were largely preserved in women on HT. Physical 
activity was not asse ssed, but the observed changes a re 
consis tent with a favorable effect of HT to maintain energy 
balance.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_377703].37 Ovarian function was 
suppressed ac utely for 6 days in premenopausal women 
(n=14) with a GnRH antagonist . REE was measured in the 
early follicular and mid -luteal phases of the menstrual cycle , 
and after 6 days of GnRH ANT. Suppression of ovarian 
function caused a decrease in REE when co mpare d with 
both the follicular  (-42 kcal/d)  and luteal phase s (-71 kcal/d) (Fig 8).   
Precision of measurement of EE.  [CONTACT_377797] validated the measurement of EE by [CONTACT_377746] 1 -2%, with a standard deviation of 6 -8%.59-61 He has 
also performed reproducibility studies to assess the technical and biological variability  in repeated 
measurements of TEE by [CONTACT_377747] (0.98 – 
0.99) .62,63 [CONTACT_377795] has performed repeated measurements of  TEE (N=15) in the  metabolic chamber  and 
also found the intraclass  correlation coefficient to be high (r=0.964 ). The  difference between repeated 
measurements was 38±76 kcal/day.   
Likelihood that the proposed study can be carried out successfully . A major determinant of the success of the  
proposed study will be the ability to recruit  women into a project that involves the manipulation of sex hormone 
levels , an exercise intervention, and a burdensome testing schedule. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_377704] a study 
(R01 AG018198) in premenopausal women that involves a similar inte rvention ( all women undergo GnRH AG 
with add -back of placebo or E 2 for 5 months)  and a similarly burdensome testing  schedule . The primary aims 
of that  study are to determine 1) whether the suppression of ovarian function with placebo add -back causes a 
decrease in REE (as a mechanism for fat gain) and an exaggerated serum cortisol response to  physiologic and 
pharmacologic stress ors (as a mechanism for abdominal fat gain); and 2) whether E [ADDRESS_472818]; of these,

data cannot be presented in a treatment -specific manne r. However, for the [ADDRESS_472820] had 
measurements of REE before and after the intervention, the average change is -33±113 kcal/d. Our hypothesis 
is that REE will decrease by 40 to 50 kcal/d in women on GnRH AG+placebo and be maintained in women on 
GnRH AG+E2; the pooled mean data are consistent with the expected pattern of change.  
Summary.  The investigators are experienced in the methodologies to be employed and in carrying out 
intervention trials of similar complexity. They are well -qualified and well -prepared to carry out the proposed 
study. Preli minary data support the concept that sex hormones influence energy balance. The SCOR  will 
facilitate the expansion of this research to determine how the suppression of ovarian function influences PAEE  
and other determinants of energy balance (TEE, SEE).  
2.d. Research methods  
2.d.1. Overview  
This will be a randomized, double -blinded  (to the extent possible) , placebo -controlled intervention to determine 
whether the suppression of ovarian function with Gn RH AG disrupts energy balance by [CONTACT_95712] a decrease in 
PAEE. Secondary aims are to determine the effects of the suppression of ovarian function on other  
components  of energy expenditure and on biomarkers of disease risk and whether the consequences of 
GnRH AG can be mitigated through programmed exercise. Participants will be women who are nearing the 
menopausal transition based on age (42 -52 y) but have normal menstrual cycle function. They will be 
randomized to receive monthly injections of placebo or GnRH AG (leuprolide acetate, 3.75 mg)  for 24 weeks . 
Women who receive GnRH AG will be further randomized to no exercise or a supervised exercise program. 
Thus, the 3 treatment arms are: placebo, GnRH AG, GnRH AG+exercise.  Although a 2x2 study design (placebo 
vs drug ; no exercise vs exercise) was considered , this was not feasible given the resources available under the 
grant mechanism.  
2.d.2. Outcome variables  
The primary outcome (Aim 1) will be PAEE  after [ADDRESS_472821] calorimetry. It will be assessed at baseline 
and after 12 and 24 weeks of intervention. The rationale for PAEE as the primary outcome is the dramatic 
decrease in PA in response to OVX in laboratory animals  (Fig 1) , which could be a primary trigger for 
subsequent changes in adiposity and metabolic function . This will be the first controlled intervention trial to 
determine whether an objective measure of PA decreases in response to the suppression of o varian function in 
women.  GnRH AG therapy for 4 months or longer increase s fat mass and decrease  fat-free mass  (FFM) .9,10,36 
One concern is  that women may begin  to adopt compensatory behavioral changes (e.g., decreased food 
intake, increased physical activity) if changes in body composition are sensed.  Thus, the greatest biologically -
mediated  decrease in  PAEE may occur at the intermediate testing interval  (12 weeks) , before measurable 
changes in body composition are expected to occur ; this will be the primary study endpoint.  
Other secondary outcomes of the study will include : 24-h TEE measured by [CONTACT_377732]; REE, SEE, and TEF 
measured by [CONTACT_377748] a metabolic chamber; energy intake estimated from food records; physical 
activity measured by [CONTACT_91152]; body composition measured by [CONTACT_751] -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA); 
glucose and insulin responses to an OGTT; serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines ( IL-6, hsCRP ); 
and biomarkers in adipose tissue samples .  
2.d.3. Study population  
Volunteers will be women nearing the menopausal tr ansition, based on age ( 40 to 60 y), with normal menstrual 
cycle functi on. The rationale  for this approach was driven by [CONTACT_377736] a menopause -related 
decline in PA likely begins 3  to 4 years before menopause (Fig 6). We chose not to focus the study on women 
with perimenopausal symptoms for two reasons: 1) we may m iss part of the perimenopause -related change in 
PAEE, and 2) the irregularity of menstrual cycles during the perimenopause complicates the scheduling of 
baseline tests  around menstrual cycle phase . Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are in Section [ADDRESS_472822] of ovarian hormone suppression on PAEE was conservatively set at -25%, based on the

is 2(1 -)σ2. Using a conservative value of 0.90 for  (actual value, 0.98)62 and assuming no change in variance 
as PAEE decreases, the SD of the change will be 148  kcal/d . Based on the analysis plan to conduct a [ADDRESS_472824] 
ANOVA wit h two contrasts (placebo vs GnRH AG; GnRH AG vs GnRH AG+exercise), a sample size of 15 in each of 
3 groups will achieve 95% power for either test to detect a 200 kcal/d  difference between two groups in the 
change in PAEE using a t test at the 0.05 significanc e level. To account for attrition, we will enroll 22 per group.  
2.d.5. Screening procedures  
After providing informed consent, volunteers will undergo 2 days of screening tests. Day 1 will include a n 
assessment of depressive symptoms  (Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_377705] (CESD) , a clinical 
laboratory evaluation including a comprehensive metabolic profile, TSH, a complete blood count , and a 
medical history and physical examination  by [CONTACT_1003] . If volunteers are found to be depressed after 
administering the CESD  (score of >16), the  study clinician will administer the  Beck Depression I nventory (BDI -
II). As score of <18 on the BDI -II will be used along with clinical judgement to determine final eligibility ; this 
approach was used in a pr evious study completed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kohrt.  At the second visit, participants will unde rgo 
proximal femur and lumber spi[INVESTIGATOR_377706] (BMD t -scores of <-2.0) because BMD may decrease during GnRH AG treatment . A urine 
pregnancy test will be done prior to the DXA scan. Afterwards a  resting BP a nd [ADDRESS_472825] (GXT), with monitoring of BP and [ADDRESS_472826] assignment into the 3 treatment 
groups. Randomi zation will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] ( 40-46, 47 -60 y). The randomization sequences will be 
generated by [CONTACT_46134], who will determine the treatment assignment for an individual once study 
eligibility has been confirmed. The treatment assignment will be given to the research  nurse , who will oversee 
the administration of the placebo (saline) and GnRH AG injections . The nurse will  not be responsible for 
acquisition of study outcomes data; such data will be collected by [CONTACT_377749] . Randomization will occur after eligibility for the study has been de termined.  
Although the GnRH AG will be administered to participants in a blinded manner, it is ack nowledged that 
participants may  be aware of treatment status because of the cessation of menses that typi[INVESTIGATOR_14923]. 
Participants will be informed that mens trual cycles may stop either because of the drug intervention or because 
they are approaching the age of menopause. Participants will be further informed that menstrual cycles may 
not resume or may be irregular after the completion of the intervention  beca use they are approaching the age 
of menopause. We are aware of one study suggesting that menstrual cycle function may not resume in older 
pre-/perimenopausal women following GnRH AG therapy if the pretreatment serum FSH level measured during 
days 3 to 5 of the follicular phase  is >25 mIU/mL.67 We will exclude volunteers who meet this criterion because 
of the possibility that this may be an early harbinger of the menopause.  
2.d.7. Interventions  
Drug intervention . The drug intervention will be monthly intramuscular injections of placebo (saline) or 
leuprolide acetate ( 3.75 mg for depot suspension ; Abbott Laboratories ; Abbott Park , IL) for [ADDRESS_472827] of participants will be randomized to receive placebo and two -thirds will receive GnRH AG. Absence of 
pregnancy will be confirmed before each dosing. A single injection of leuprolide acetate produces an initial 
stimulation (for up to ~2  wk) followed by a prolonged suppressi on of pi[INVESTIGATOR_377707]; r epeated monthly dosing maintains the suppression of ovarian  function . Leuprolide acetate 
has been used clinically for up to 1 year without serious adverse events, although there may be a decrease in  
BMD that recovers slowly following cessation of treatment.68,69 Side effects are those typi[INVESTIGATOR_377708] . In studies of women with uterine fibroids, GnRH AG 3.75 mg/mo induced amenorrhea in 61%, 86%, 
and 90% of women after 1, 2, and 3 mo of treatment, respectively.70,71 Retur n of menses typi[INVESTIGATOR_377709]# 12 -1157  
V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page [ADDRESS_472828] clinical dose 
suppresses ovarian function and results in  fat gain  after 24 weeks of treatment.9,10 
Injections will be administered in a blinded manner, but participants on GnRH AG will likely k now their drug 
assignment  because of the induction of amenorrhea . For this reason, volunteers will not be informed during the 
consenting process that the primary aim of the study is to determine whether GnRH AG causes a decline in 
physical activity ( i.e., such knowledge may change behavior) . Rather, women will be informed that the loss of 
normal ovarian function may alter how the body uses energy  or have other metabolic effects . Participants who 
do not tolerate GnRH AG therapy can refuse further treatment after each monthl y dosing. Among the first 64  
premenopausal women treated with GnRH AG in the PI’s ongoing study (A G018198), this occurred only once . 
Participants who undergo at least [ADDRESS_472829] sedentary behavior, it 
may be possi ble to override this through programmed exercise. In laboratory animals, E 2 add-back and 
programmed exercise (i.e., treadmill running) each prevent ed, to a large extent, the OVX -related changes in 
body composition and biomarkers of disease risk (Fig 5).25-29 The intent of SA4 is to determine whether 
programmed exercis e can offset the decline in PAEE in response to GnRH AG (PAEE: GnRH AG < 
GnRH AG+exercise  ). Although it may seem logical to assume this will occur, it is possible that programmed 
exercise will cause a further decrease in other physical activities, such that programmed exercise produces no 
net gain in PAEE.   
Women randomized to GnRH AG+exercise will come to the Exercise R esearch Laboratory (ERL) for a 
supervised exercise program.  The exercise facility in the ERL is open for research participants 6:30-8:30am, 
11:30am -1:30pm, and 4:30 -6:30pm Mon through Fri. The goal of the exercise program will be to generate an 
increase in EE of ~1400 kcal/w k to offset the projected decrease in PAEE. Women will be instructed to come in 
at least 3 days per week so that regular oversight and encouragement for exercise can be provided. The 
center -based program will be augmented with recommendations for home -based exercise  to meet the weekly 
exercise goals . Individualized, endurance -based (e.g., treadmill, elliptical, rowing, cycling) exercise 
prescription s will be designed  to increase energy expenditure by 200-300 kcal per session. As an example, a 
75-kg woman with a maximal aerobic power (VO 2max) of 25 mL/min/kg exercising at 65% of VO 2max would 
have to exercise  ~40 m in to increase energy expenditure by ~[ADDRESS_472830] come to the Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTR C) every 4 weeks for 24 
weeks for GnRH AG and placebo injections. Compliance to the drug intervention will be tracked by [CONTACT_66787], who will deliver all of the injections.  If the delivery of a dose is delayed (e.g., participant misses an 
appointmen t), it will be administered as soon as possible.  
Compliance to center -based exercise will be monitored directly by [CONTACT_377750]. Participant s will be contact[CONTACT_377751] [ADDRESS_472831] the activities performed  at the ERL ; this information will be 
computerized so that the supervised exercise exposure can be calculated. Home -based exercise will be 
captured for all participants thro ugh the measurements of TEE by [CONTACT_377752].

 Measurement of physical activity . Physical activity will be measured using ActivPal monitors. The ActivPal 
categorizes free-living activity into periods spen t sitting/lying, standing , and walking. This information can 
be used to estimate daily energy expenditure and track changes in free -living activity profile . There is no 
display  to provide feedback to the participant. Participants  will be instructed to wear the monitor for 7 
consecutive days at all times except when sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_377710] -based activiti es (e.g. showering,

The pre -intervention  10-d test will start during the mid -follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Participants will 
report to the lab in the morning after an overnight fast. A urine specimen will be collected and the participant 
will then consume an oral dose of water containing 1.8 g/kg total bod y water (TBW) of 10 atom percent excess 
(APE) 18O and 0.12 g/kg TBW of 99.[ADDRESS_472835]. Schoeller.74 Urine 
samples for the measurement of 2H218O will be obtained approximate ly 3 and 4 hours after dosing. Two u rine 
samples will also be collected 10 days after dosing , 1 hour apart . Sample aliquots of 4 mL each will be store d 
in cryogenic tubes and  frozen  at -10C. Samples will be decolorized with 200 mg/5 mL of dry carbon black and

method are its objectivity, minimal interference with daily activities, accuracy , and precision. It is objective 
because the body wat er acts as a metabolic recorder ; the participant does not have to keep logs or report a 
history. The tracer elimination rates are determined from spot urines collected on the day the tracer is given by 
[CONTACT_377755], so there is little disruption of 
daily acti vities. The DLW method has

CVs for BMD of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter were 1.3±0.7 %, 1.1±0.9%, 1.9±1.0%, 
and 1.4±1.0%, respectively. Total body scans will be analyzed for total fat mass and FFM, and regional (i.e., 
legs, arms, and trunk) fat mass. An increase in the ratio of trunk -to-leg fat mass in response to GnRH AG will be 
interprete d as a shift in fat distribution pattern toward increased abdominal adiposity.9,[ADDRESS_472837] 150g/day of carbohydrates .

tests may be conducted over [ADDRESS_472838] hour. At 
0900h, they will drink a 75 -g glucose beverage and remain semi -recumbent  for the next 2  hours for the TEF 
measurem ent. To mimic typi[INVESTIGATOR_377713], two  30-min bouts of treadmill walking at 3 mph  
will be performed at  1500h  and 1630h. This activity should produce a physical activity level (PAL; TEE/REE) of 
~1.5 (unpublished observations , Melanson a nd Kohrt ). All urine will be collected and analyzed for urine 
nitrogen, urea nitrog en, and creatinine for substrate oxidation calculations . Core temperature will be measured 
during the chamber stay using an ingestible thermistor capsule (length 23 mm, diam eter 8.6 mm) and a 
VitalSense telemetric monitor.  TEE will be calculated as previously described.[ADDRESS_472839] 24 -h fat oxidation .82,83 Subjects will be asked to refrain from structured exercise the day before the 
chamber stay. Diet will not be controlled because of the possibility that energy intake (and possibly 
macronutrient preference) is influenced by [CONTACT_377756]. The energy composition of the diet for the 
chamber stay will be 30% fat, 55 % carbohydrate, and 15% protein,  with the 75g glucose beverage accou nting 
for breakfast and about 25% of total energy  needs,  while both  lunch and dinner will each account for about 30 -
35% of total energy needs . ‘Extra’ calories will be provided in the form of a snack box that participants will have 
free access to from the time the lunch mea l is delivered until lights out . Participants will be instructed to eat 
what they want and that it is not necessary to eat all the food provided. This approach may provide insight on 
whether the suppressi on of ovarian function promotes hyperphagia. Data from each calorimeter stay will be 
evaluated for state of energy balance.  
The rationale  for the chamber stay is to 1) obtain a prolonged measure of basal metabolic rate for the 
calculation of PAEE , 2) obtain a measure of TEE  under controlled conditions , 3) determine whether TEF is 
influenced by [CONTACT_377757], and 4) determine whether EE during a specific physical task (steppi[INVESTIGATOR_338471]) is 
influenced by [CONTACT_377757]. PAEE will be the difference between TEE measured by [CONTACT_377732] (adjusted -10% for TEF) 
and SEE measured during the chamber stay, as previously described.14 The OGTT will be performed in the 
calorimeter to avoid a separate visit for participants and to assess whether the TEF is influenced by [CONTACT_377757].84  
 Blood samples  during the chamber stay . Blood samples will be o btained before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min 
after glucose ingestion. These will be used for the measurement of insulin resistance (product of the glucose 
and insulin areas under the curve ) and inflammatory cytokines ( IL-6, hsCRP ) for SA3. The assays will be 
performed by [CONTACT_377758]. The extent to which changes in disease risk could be explored was 
limited by [CONTACT_377759] P50 mechanism. Measures of insulin resistance and mild chronic 
inflammation were selected because of the  prominent role these factors play in metabolic dysfunction.85  
Chamber stay alternative . Heavy use of the metabolic chamber for  multiple research protocols has created 
scheduling difficulties. Subjects  who cannot complete the 24 -hr metabolic chamber stay in a timely manner will 
be offered the option of completing this  alternative approach. Subjects will report fasted  to the CTRC a t 7:00am 
and will have vitals measured and an  IV catheter inserted for the OGTT. At 7:30am they will consume a [ADDRESS_472840] calorimetry using the ventilated

Tissue biopsies . This research project is a component (Project I) of a Specialized Center of Research 
(SCOR) on Sex Differences (PI, Wendy Kohrt) sponsored by [CONTACT_377760]’s Health. 
The topic of the UCAMC SCOR is Bioenergetic and Metabolic Consequences of the Loss of Gonadal Function . 
SCOR Project II  (PI, Paul MacLean) is a preclinical study (animals) of Effects of Pre -existing Obesity on 
Consequences of the Loss of Ovarian Function . SCOR Project III  (PI, Dwight Klemm) is a basic study 
(animals) on Sex Hormones Differentially Regulate Production of Disti nct Adipocyte Populations . The tissue 
samples to be obtained from participants in Project I  (below) will address specific aims  from Project I  as well 
as Projects II and III.  
Tissue will be obtained from vastus lateralis muscle tissue for SCOR Project II  and abdominal and femor al 
subcutaneous adipose tissue for SCOR Project I  and SCOR Project III . Percutaneous muscle samples  will be 
obtained from the vastus lateralis. Following lidocaine injection, a small  incision will be made in the  fascia of the 
vastus lateralis and 100 -200 mg of muscle tissue will be removed using a Bergstrom side -cut biopsy needle with 
suction applied. Tissue will be flash frozen with liquid N 2. Subcutaneous adipose samples  will be collected from the 
lateral thigh region adjacent to th e muscle biopsy site  and the periumbilical region of the abdomen . An infusion 
cannula is inserted through a small skin incision (same incision as muscle biopsy for femoral collection) to infiltrate 
a 50-100 cm2 area of subcutaneous adipose tissue with 50 m l of normal saline containing 0.0015% lidocaine (15 
ml 1% lidocaine per 100 ml saline).  An aspi[INVESTIGATOR_377714] 10 cc of a mixture of fluid and 
adipose tissue using Coleman’s manual vacuum  (“mini liposuction”) technique .86 Collected tissue will be separated 
from the fluid and processed for analysis. Th e incision will be closed with a suture, covered with a bandage, and 
an ice compress applied for 10 min.   
Vascular sub -study procedures.  
Resting Arterial Blood Pressure. At baseline and after Phases 2 and 3 brachial artery blood pressure will be 
measured both sitting (after [ADDRESS_472842]) and supi[INVESTIGATOR_377715], comfortable ambient laboratory conditions.  
Blood pressure will be measured in triplicate using an oscillom etric technique (Dinamap).  
 
Arterial Stiffness . Common carotid artery diameter will be measured from the images derived from an 
ultrasound machine (GE Vivid i) equipped with a linear array transducer as previously described in CTRC 
protocols 1574, 1618, 1 673 and 1466.  Carotid diameter image will be analyzed using image analysis software 
(Carotid Analyzer).  The pressure waveform and amplitude will be obtained from the common carotid artery 
using arterial applanation tonometry, a high -fidelity strain gauge  transducer (Millar Instruments).  The 
combination of ultrasound imaging of the common carotid artery with simultaneous applanation tonometric -
obtained arterial pressure waveforms from the contralateral artery permits noninvasive determination of carotid 
artery compliance.   
 
Endothelial Function . Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery will be used as a non -invasive 
measure of endothelial function, as previously described in CTRC protocols 1574, 1618, 1466 and 1673.  
Briefly, a pediatric cuff w ill be placed on the upper forearm and the brachial artery will be located 2 -3 cm above 
the antecubital fossa.  After obtaining concurrent measures of baseline brachial artery diameter and blood flow 
velocity, reactive hyperemia will be produced by [CONTACT_377761] ~250 mmHg of pressure for 5 minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_184531].  After the release of the arterial occlusion, Doppler blood flow velocity and B -mode 
ultrasound brachial artery diameter images will be measured continuously and concurrentl y for 2 minutes.  
Brachial artery diameter and flow velocity will be acquired and analyzed using a commercially available 
software package (Vascular Analysis Tools 5.5.1, Medical Imaging Applications, LLC, Iowa City, IA).   
 
Visit 5 – start placebo/GnRH AG intervention.  The intervention will start in the early follicular phase of the next 
menstrual cycle to avoid the induction of another menstrual cycle. Absence of pregnancy  will be confirmed.

V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page 14 of 28 Participants will receive a total of 6 injections at 4 -week inter vals. They will complete 3 questionnaires at this 
visits: the Menopausal Symptom List (MSL) on the frequency and severity of menopause -related  symptoms  
(e.g., hot flashes, depressed feelings),87 the Eating Behavior Questionnaire (EBQ) to monitor dietary restraint, 
disinhibition, and hunger,88 and the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) to monitor sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_172510].89  
 2.d.9.2. Follow -up testing  
Monthly visits . Participants will meet with the study research nurse every 4 we eks. They will complete the MSL, 
EBQ, PSQI, an exercise motivation questionnaire, and a health status questionnaire that inquires about 
changes in use of medications (prescription and over -the-counter), changes in health (e.g ., doctor visits, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]), and any study -related problems/concerns over the past 4 weeks. This will provide a regular 
mechanism by [CONTACT_377762]. They will pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049] a physical activity monitor to wear for 7 
days and return b y mail or in person. Following confirmation of the absence of pregnancy, a placebo or 
GnRH AG dose will be delivered.  
Intervention weeks 10  to 12 . Study visits V1 to V4 (Fig 9)  will be repeated during weeks 10  to 12 of the 
intervention. The rationale  for intermediate (12 weeks) and final (24 weeks) testing intervals is that previous 
studies of GnRH AG therapy  in premenopausal women found that body composition is not significantly  changed 
after 12 weeks  of treatment90,91 but is significantly changed after  24 weeks .9,10,36,92 One concern is that women 
may begin to adopt compensatory  behavioral changes (e.g., decreased food intake, increased physical 
activity) when  changes in body composition are sensed. Thus, the grea test change in PAEE may be apparent 
at the  intermediate testing interval . However, the final testing interval will enable us to determine whether the 
disruption in energy balance does, indeed, lead to the expecte d changes in body composition. This testing plan 
is congruent with [CONTACT_377797]’s recommendation that at least 10 weeks should separate serial measurements 
of TEE by [CONTACT_377732] (personal communication).  
Intervention weeks 22 to 24 . Study visits V1 to V4 (Fig 9) will be repeated during weeks [ADDRESS_472843] period (and longer  if a competing renewal is successful ). This will enable 
us to assess the bioenergetic and metabolic consequences of women who undergo the natural me nopause. 
This will serve two major purposes: 1) It will facilitate a comparison of the findings with the only other study to 
evaluate such outcomes in women through the menopausal transition, which was carried out in Louisiana;12 
and 2) It will help us t o determine whether changes measured in response to an experimental model of 
menopause (GnRH AG) are consistent with those that occur during the natural menopause. This will have 
important implications for future research on the health consequences of the l oss of ovarian function.  If there 
are sufficient funds to pursue such long-term follow -up, we will update the protocol and create a 
second Consent Form which identifies  specific study visits / outcomes  and their associated risks.  
Limitation of the follow -up testing schedule . For women assigned to the placebo treatment arm, the follow -up 
tests will  not necessarily occur at the same point in the menstrual cycle as the baseline test. Testing will occur 
during specific time intervals (weeks 10 -12, 22 -24) to be c onsistent with the GnRH AG arms. Because this may 
increase the variance of changes in bioenergetics in the placebo arm, the sample size calculations relied on 
conservative assumptions (e.g., ability to detect a 25% change in PAEE; use of  = 0.9; power of 9 5%).  
2.d.10. Data analysis  
General Analysis Plan . Data analysis will occur in 4 steps: 1) Descriptive analyses (including boxplots, 
scatterplots, profile plots to examine change over time) will be conducted for quality assurance and to assess 
need for data transformation; 2) demographic and baseline characteristics of the groups will be compared;  3) 
primary and secondary analyses will be completed; and 4) findings will be assessed for their robustness to 
issues including the effects of any imbalances i n important baseline covariates and the eff ects of missing data . 
Primary Analysis . The primary analysis (SA1) will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the differences in the 
change in PAEE measured after 12 weeks of placebo or GnRH AG therapy. This compa rison will be conditioned 
on the stratificati on variable, age group ( 40-46, 47 -60y). Statistical inference regarding the difference between 
treatment groups will be based on the estimated coefficient for a treatment group indicator variable in a linear 
regression model with 24-week change from baseline as the response variable,  and explanatory variables, 
 COMIRB# 12 -1157  
V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page 15 of 28 including treatment group, age group, and 
baseline PAEE; the latter is included to 
improve the precision/power of the inference 
about treatment differences . The conclusion 
about statistical significance will be drawn 
from the linear contrast comparing the placebo 
and GnRH AG groups.  
Secondary Analyses.  To address SA2 and 
SA3, 24-week differences in other outcome 
measures (24-h TEE, REE, SEE, TEF, PA by 
[CONTACT_91152], measurement of biomarkers in 
adipose tissue samples, glucose  and insulin 
response to OGTT, serum concentrations of 
inflammatory cytokines, and body composition  will be analyzed as above.  Secondary analyses will be 
evaluated for their consist ency with the conclusions on the primary endpoint. We anticipate that changes in the 
secondary outcomes  will be consistent (i.e., in terms of biological plausibility)  with changes in the primary 
outcome so that significant differences in the primary endpoi nt will be reinforced by [CONTACT_377763]. 
Failure to find biological consistency in primary and secondary endpoints will be taken as evidence that the 
effects of hormone suppression are not clear and that further study is necess ary to resolve incons istencies. 
This approach will reduce the risk of false -positive conclusions resulting from mult iple statistical tests. SA4 will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_377764], regressing change in PAEE or REE on baseline, a ge group, 
and treatment group, adding a linear contrast to compare  the GnRH AG and GnRH AG +exercise groups.  
Exploratory Aim . Will be evaluated by [CONTACT_377764], regressing change in vascular 
outcomes (arterial stiffness or FMD) on baseline and treatment group, adding a linear contra st to compare the 
GnRH AG and GnRH AG +exercise groups.  
The characteristics of the time trajectory (at 12 and 24 weeks) for treatment effects will also be determined in 
secondary analyses. These analyses will evaluate the biological plausibility of the time trajectory (i.e., a 
biologically -meaningful time trend) to rule out false positive conclusions in the primary analysis. Evaluation of 
the time trajectory will also motivate future studies of mechanisms and methods to  improve longer -term 
outcomes. The analytic methods to be used for evaluation of the time trajectory include a mixed -effects model 
with time as a fixed covariate to estimate the mean effect at each measur ement time,[ADDRESS_472844] management by [CONTACT_377765] ([CONTACT_377798]). Whenever possible, study data will be 
transferred electronically into the Center on Aging SQL database. Double entry will be used for manually 
entered outcome data to track entry errors. Manual data entry will use the Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap) interface, which is a secure web application. It provides user -friendly case report forms, real -time 
data entry validation (e.g., for data types and range checks), audit trails, and a de -identified data export

Development and Informatics Service Center (DISC), which will be used as a central location for data 
processing and management. Data back -up and security measures are those expected of an Informatics Core 
at a major academic research institution. Data quality checks will be ongoing, but will formally occur (e.g., 
checks for duplicate entries, missing data) at least annually when progress reports are prepared.

V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page 16 of 28 consequences of natural menopause. It is different from menopause in that is causes a relatively abrupt 
withdrawal of ovarian function (i.e., weeks rather than years) and does not generate the same gona dotropin 
response of menopause  (i.e., low rather than high) . With respect to the latter, it is not the OVX -induced 
increase in gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_377717]. GnRH AG 
therapy (low gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]) reduced  wheel-running activity to the same extent ( ~45% ) as OVX [ADDRESS_472846] to whether the abruptness of the loss of 
ovarian function is an important determinant of the bioenergetic consequences, there is a relatively novel 
animal model of ovarian failure tha t appears to recapi[INVESTIGATOR_377718]. The ovotoxic 
chemical 4 -vinylcyclohex ene diepoxide (VCD) destroys ovarian follicles  by [CONTACT_377766] ; other tissues are n ot affected.[ADDRESS_472847] persistent diestrus within ~2 months and progress to  a ‘postmenopausal’ state  by ~[ADDRESS_472848] a 
pronounced increase in abdominal fat and insulin resistance.98 This limited preclinical evidence suggests that 
the bioenergetic a nd metabolic responses to GnRH AG therapy are likely to be similar to the effects of natural 
menopause. T he use of GnRH AG therapy in the proposed study may be a limitation because it does not 
perfectly mimic the menopause , but it  is also a major strength. I n women, the menopause is a process, not an 
event, which  occurs over a variable and unpredictable number of years , making it difficult to study except in 
large cohort studies . Such studies are typi[INVESTIGATOR_377719]. 
Because the menopause occurs during mid -life, at a time when other chronological aging effects are also 
occurring, it is difficult to isolate the consequences of ovarian failure.  The GnRH AG model will allow us to look 
spec ifically at the loss of ovarian function as a trigger for bioenergetic and metabolic changes that could 
increase disease risk in women.  To the extent resources will allow (see budget justification), women in the 
proposed study will be studied at annual visits after they complete the intervention to capture the bioenergetic 
and metabolic changes of natural menopause.  
Women in the placebo group may progress to peri -menopausal status during the 6 -month intervention (they 
cannot become postmenopausal by [CONTACT_377767] 12 months) and may, therefore, have a 
decline in PAEE. This was taken into account by [CONTACT_377768]. Secondary data analyses will also be performed that include only women who maintain 
premenopau sal status over the period of intervention.  
The potential effects of GnRH AG therapy to reduce PAEE could be mediated by a number of factors not being 
thoroughly studied in this project  (e.g., sleep disturbance secondary to the expected increase in menopaus al 
symptoms in women on GnRH AG). The Ancillary Projects program of the SCOR could support the addition of 
some outcomes measures, but careful consideration will be given to the impact on subject burden before any 
ancillary projects are approved.  
 
3. Protection of human subjects  
The proposed study meet s the definition of a clinical trial in that it is a prospective biomedical research study of 
human subjects that involves random assignment to pharmacologic and behavior intervention groups. 
However, we conside r it to be clinical research  on a relatively small number of subjects , rather than a ‘clinical 
trial’ because it is designed to reveal mechanistic consequences of the loss of ovarian function. It is not a 
Phase III clinical trial .  
3.1  Risks to human subjects  
a. Human subjects involvement, characteristics, and design  
Volunteers who are eligible and willing to participate will undergo the intervention protocol and procedures 
described in the Research Plan. We plan to enroll 66 volunteers in the study. They will be  healthy, 
eumenorrh eic premenopausal women, aged 40 to 60 years. Eumenorrheic premenopausal status is defined as 
not yet reaching the Early Menopausal Transition Stage -2 by [CONTACT_377769] 
(STRAW) criteria.99 Stage -2 is characterized by a change in cycle length of 7 or more days (e.g., regular 
cycles every 24 days instead of 31 days). Accordingly, the medical history will query for cycle regularity in the 
past year and whether cycle length ha s changed.  The investigators debated whether to have an exclusion 
criterion for participation in regular exercise. In the absence of knowledge as to whether women who exercise 
 COMIRB# 12 -1157  
V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page [ADDRESS_472849] days of the week (defined as >4 d/wk) will be 
excluded. The pro spective cohort study that supports a decline in PAEE during the menopausal transition did 
not have an eligibility criterion based on physical activity level.12 The investigators also debated whether there 
shoul d be an exclusion criterion for body mass index (BMI). The prospective cohort study did not have one.12 
That paper did not report BMI, but fat mass averaged ~40% of body weight. In our experience, that falls into  
the ‘obese’ category by [CONTACT_44207]. Based on this, we chose the exclusion threshold as a BMI >40kg/m2.  
Inclusion criteria  
Volunteers will be women aged [ADDRESS_472850] be physically able and 
willing to be randomized to participate in a supervised exercise training program.  Volunteers for the Vascular 
sub-study will be recruited from the  larger group of participants in the parent study.  
 
Exclusion criteria  
Volunteers will be excluded from participation for the following:  
 irregular menstrual cycles defined as 2 or more missed cycles in the previous year  
 serum FSH >25 mIU/mL measured during  the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle  
 on hormonal contraceptive or menopausal therapy  
 positive pregnancy test  
 intention to become pregnant or start hormonal contraceptive therapy during the period of study  
 lactation  
 known hypersensitivity to GnRH or leuprolide acetate  
 CES-D score <16 OR  CES -D score >16 with clinician follow -up and BDI -II score <18   
 severe osteopenia or osteoporosis (i.e., proximal femur or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] t scores < -2.0)  
 abnormal vaginal bleeding  
 thyroid dysfunction, define d as an ultrasensitive TSH <0.5 or >5.0 mU/L; volunteers with abnormal TSH 
values will be re -considered for participation in the study after follow -up evaluation by [CONTACT_377770]  
 uncontrolled hypertens ion defined as resting systolic BP >150 mmHg or diastolic BP>90 mmHg; 
participants who do not meet these criteria at first screening will be re -evaluated, including after follow -
up evaluation by [CONTACT_377771] -hypertensive me dications  
 cardiovascular disease; subjective or objective indicators of ischemic heart disease (e.g., angina, ST 
segment depression) or serious arrhythmias at rest or during the graded exercise test (GXT) without 
follow -up evaluation; follow -up evaluation must include diagnostic testing (e.g., thallium stress test) with 
interpretation by a cardiologist  
 history of ve nous thromboembolic event  
 orthopedic or other problems that would interfere with participation in the exercise program  
 BMI <40 kg/m2  
The propos ed studies do not involve special classes of subjects that may be considered vulnerable 
populations. There are no additional exclusion criteria for the Vascular sub-study  
Study group assignment

V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page 18 of 28 The approach by [CONTACT_377772] a study group is described in section 
2.d.6.  
Justification for dose and frequency of study drug administration  
The rationale for the study drug regimen is discussed in section 2.d.7.  
b. Sources of materials  
The research materials that will be collected from human subjects include:  
 medical records – only when needed to follow -up on health status  
 blood and tissue samples – for screening and for study -specific outcomes, as described in the 
research strategy  
 data – from all the study procedures, as  described in the research strategy  
Only members of the research team will have access to protected health information (PHI) collected from the 
volunteers. Confidentiality of electronic data will be maintained by [CONTACT_377773] f or 
data entry. Samples sent to collaborators within the institution (Drs. Klemm and MacLean) will be de -identified. 
The master document linking patient names with identification numbers will be maintained in a separate 
password -protected file with restrict ed access. Paper records will be kept in individual study charts that are 
stored either in a locked cabinet or in a locked office. Data records will be maintained for at least [ADDRESS_472851] access. Sharing of data with 
investigators or monitoring personnel outside the institution is typi[INVESTIGATOR_290659], in a 
manner that is compliant with HIPAA regulations.  
c. Potential risks 
Study drugs:   All participants will be randomized to receive placebo (saline) or GnRH AG (leuprolide acetate) 
3.75 mg/mo by [CONTACT_377774] 4 weeks for 24 weeks (6 doses).  
 leuprolide acetate  
Contraindications for use include: hypersensitivity to GnRH, GnRH agonist analogs or any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_377720]; undiagnosed vaginal bleeding; known or suspected pregnancy; lactation.  
In women who are pregnant, use of leuprolide acetate may cause fetal abnormalities.  
Leuprolide a cetate may cause an anaphylactic reaction in volunteers with hypersensitivity to GnRH.  
Convulsions have been observed in patients taking leuprolide acetate. These included patients with medical 
conditions or those taking medications associated with convul sions. Convulsions have also been reported in 
patients without any of these conditions.   
Regular menstruation should stop during leuprolide acetate therapy but spotting or breakthrough bleeding may 
occur. Cessation of menses does not ensure that pregnancy will not occur. Normal menstrual function is 
usually restored within [ADDRESS_472852] over the 24 -week intervention should not be 
clinically significant and should be recovered slowly after discontinuation of leuprolid e acetate treatment. There 
may be a development or worsening of depression and the occurrence of memory disorders.  
Leuprolide acetate therapy for 24 weeks may cause an increase in fat mass (1 -2 kg), a decrease in fat -free 
 COMIRB# 12 -1157  
V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page 19 of 28 mass (1 -1.5 kg), an increase in to tal, LDL, and HDL cholesterol (5 -10%), and an increase in triglycerides (15 -
20%).  
Local injection site reactions including induration and abscess may occur.  
Tissue biopsies : The risks associated with adipose tissue and muscle biopsies include brief, mild burning pain 
from the local anesthetic (lidocaine), more than mild discomfort during the acquisition of muscle tissue (about 
10% of cases), and infection (less than 0.4% of cases). Allergy to the anesthetic (skin swelling or rash) occurs 
rarely. There may be persistent numbness in the biopsy area, but this is rare.  
DXA:  The DXA (to assess BMD and body composition) procedure involves exposure to ionizing radiation. All 
DXA measurements during the study (whole body 3 times, lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_147168] 2 times) during 
the study involve a total effective radiation exposure that is roughly equivalent to spending 5 days outside in 
Denver (< 50 mrems), or about ~1 % of the annual allowable exposure for radiation workers. This risk is 
minimized by [CONTACT_377775] , thereby [CONTACT_377776].  
Exercise Testing and Training:  The risks associated with exercise include falls, pain in muscles or joints, 
dizziness, fainting, irregular heartbeats. Rarely,  exercise testing can result in a stroke, heart attack, or death. 
The risk of death during or immediately after an exercise test is less than [ADDRESS_472853] pain, is less than 2 in 1000. The same discomforts and risks are present during 
the exercise training program.  
Venipuncture and IV catheters :  There is a small risk of local hematoma, infection, and thrombosis associated 
with intravenous blood sampling.  
Arterial endothelial function test  (Vascular sub -study) : the 5 minutes of cuff occlusion may cause a tingling in 
your fingers and hands, a feeling of pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625], and may cause you to feel pain.  
 
Confidentiality and privacy :  The use of questionnaires, interviews, and collection of personal medical 
information poses a risk to confidentiality and privacy and may cause embarrassment.  
3.[ADDRESS_472854] proven successful in attracting 
volunteers to other projects the PI [INVESTIGATOR_377721], including projects involving GnRH AG and exercise 
interv entions. The recruitment strategies will include (ranked from most to least successful):  
 radio advertisements – utilization of radio stations that target a demographic consistent with the study 
population  
 direct mailings – fliers sent to households meeting  specified demographics in geographics regions 
proximal to UCAMC  
 e-mail bulletins – system -wide (e.g., UCAMC  and UCH) e -mail blasts  
 suburban newspaper advertisements – there are many suburban journals in the Metro area that are 
issued on a weekly or monthl y basis; we specifically advertise in those that target neighborhoods in 
relative proximity to UCAMC  and those that target persons from under -represented minority groups  
 major newspaper advertisements – the major publication  in the Denver Metropolitan area has a Health 
and Fitness section that runs once per week; advertisements in these sections have targeted 
appropriate individuals for our previous studies  
 study pamphlets – pamphlets describing the study will be printed for a variety of purposes (for study 
participants to give to family and friends who may be interested in participating; to place in the UCAMC  
Ob/Gyn Clinic and other relevant clinics; to place in community recreation centers; to hand out when 
 COMIRB# 12 -1157  
V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page 20 of 28 the investigators  give community lectures)  
 university advertisements – advertisements will be placed on a quarterly basis in the two UCAMC  
publications that target students/faculty/staff and alumni  
 community lectures – the investigators participate in a UCAMC -sponsored he alth-related lecture series 
for the community as well as other lectures sponsored by [CONTACT_377777], which takes 60 -90 min. Volunteers are either 
sent a copy of the consent form in advance or are given one at the start of the orientation; time is allowed for 
review of the consent form. Volunteers then meet with a member of the research team to a) have the study and 
what is expected of them explained in  detail; b) discuss their reasons and motivation for wanting to participate 
to determine whether they are realistic; c) discuss any practical problems (e.g., scheduling conflicts, vacations) 
that could interfere with participation; d) have their questions answered; and e) demonstrate their ability to 
provide informed consent by [CONTACT_377778] . The research team member in charge of informed consent will fill o ut the 
documentation of informed consent standard checklist. Volunteers are given a signed copy of the consent form 
and a signed copy  of the consent and the documentation of informed consent  checklist will be  maintained in  
the study chart for each particip ant. The consent form includes HIPAA authorization.  
Members of the research group who obtain consent and HIPAA authorization will be in compliance with IRB 
and HIPAA education requirements. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_377722].  
b. Protections against risk  
Plans to minimize risks  
Study drugs:   The risks associated with use of the study drugs will be minimized by [CONTACT_377779]. Volunteers will undergo a medical history and physical examination 
by [CONTACT_377780] a max imal exercise stress test. Participants will be observed for [ADDRESS_472855] pregnancy; 
contraception  (not hormonal) must be used. The exercise training intervention that one -third of the participants 
will engage in is expected to minimize changes in body composition. Participants randomized to the non -
exercise arms will be given the opportunity to underg o exercise training after the study to help reverse any 
changes in body composition that occurred.  
DXA:  The risk of radiation exposure is minimized by [CONTACT_377781], 
thereby [CONTACT_377782].  Pregnancy tests will be done prior to each 
DXA scan to reduce risk of fetal radiation exposure.  
Exercise testing and training : The risks of exercise testing and training will be minimized by [CONTACT_377783]:  
 Endpoints for  exercise tests :  In asymptomatic individuals who do not develop cardiovascular abnormalities, 
the endpoint for the maximal exercise tests will be severe fatigue that forces cessation of exercise. The criteria 
that will be used to stop the exercise test be fore volitional fatigue include the development of: (a) ST -segment 
depression of more than 0.2 mV that is either horizontal, downslopi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or slowly upslopi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (less than 1 mV/sec) 
and lasts for 0.[ADDRESS_472856] -segment elevation greater than 0.1 mV; (b) ches t pain or discomfort; (c) serious 
arrhythmias, including multifocal PVCs, ventricular tachycardia, frequent (>10/min) PVCs or couplets, or 
sustained atrial tachyarrhythmias; (d) A -V block or other conduction defects; (e) a fall of systolic blood pressure 
of 10 mmHg or greater from the peak level with increasing exercise intensity; (f) diastolic blood pressure above 
110 mmHg or systolic above 220 mmHg; (g) dizziness; (h) ataxic gait; and (i) pallor or cyanosis.  
 Training of personnel : Personnel assisting wi th the administration of screening treadmill tests will have BLS 
 COMIRB# 12 -1157  
V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page [ADDRESS_472857] or be in the immediate vicinity (i.e., can be 
present within 3 minutes) . A physician will interpret ECG and BP response s for all screening treadmill tests.  
Screening of volunteers : To minimize risks of exercise testing in subjects, testing will be conducted only 
after the volunteer is examined by a clinician and after a resting ECG is obtained and evaluated. During 
exerci se testing, the ECG is monitored constantly and BP is measured frequently. Exercise tests are 
terminated if any of the ACSM absolute or relative stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_23893]. The AHA -recommended 
emergency equipment and supplies will be available, including: a utomated electronic defibrillator; portable 
oxygen tank, nasal cannula, ventimask, non -rebreathing mask, and appropriate tubing to connect to the 
oxygen tank; oral airways; bag -valve -mask hand respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521]; syringes and needles; IV tubing, solutions, and 
stand; and adhesive tape. The Exercise Research Laboratory operates as a 911 emergency response facility, 
as do all other UCH outpatient clinics.  
Exercise training . The risks of exercise training will be minimized by [CONTACT_377784].  
Tissue Biopsies : Risks of the adipose and muscle biopsy procedures will be minimized  by [CONTACT_7661] a trained 
clinician perform the procedure. Persons with a prior history of allergies to local anesthetics will not be enrolled. 
Participants will return to the laboratory within one week of the biopsies to assess wound healing.  
DXA:  The acquisi tion of DXA data by [CONTACT_377785] b y reducing the 
need to perform repeated scans.  Scans will not be performed in women who are pregnant.  
Venipuncture :  The risks of hematoma and infection are minimized by [CONTACT_377786] d personnel perform the 
procedures using sterile techniques.  
Confidentiality and privacy : These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_377787], when possible, and by [CONTACT_377788] i nformation in a private 
setting.  
Evaluation of study -related events  
Participants will meet with a study clinician every [ADDRESS_472858] an 
opportunity to participate in a supervised exercise training program either during or after the study intervention 
period that may trigger benefic ial adaptations, but not all individuals respond favorably to exercise with such 
adaptations.  
The potential benefits of the study to women in general could be significant. The study is expected to lead to 
the scientific discovery of the role of ovarian fu nction in regulating energy balance, body composition, and 
disease risk. This may lead to the development of strategies to improve the health of postmenopausal women. 
In light of these potential benefits, the risks to subjects are acceptable.  
3.4  Importance o f knowledge to be gained  
The importance of understanding mechanisms that contribute to risk for obesity cannot be overstated given the 
current epi[INVESTIGATOR_377723] U.S. and other developed countries worldwide. Although the 
loss of ovar ian function is only one of a multitude of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors that 
increase risk for fat gain, it is potentially a very important one in women. The strong evidence from multiple 
large RCTs and smaller physiologic trials in dicates that estrogen -based hormone therapy (HT) attenuates 
weight gain in postmenopausal women by [CONTACT_5554] 40%. Further, in the absence of HT, weight gain in 
postmenopausal women is accompanied by a disproportionate increase in abdominal fat. Althoug h abdominal 
 COMIRB# 12 -1157  
V8.0 (4-23-19)    Page 22 of 28 obesity and the related metabolic dysfunction increases risk for CAD in both women and men, the risk of 
mortality may be ~5 -fold higher in women. Also, it has been estimated that abdominal obesity and metabolic 
dysfunction account for about 20%  of coronary events in men, but 48% of events in women. Such statistics 
underscore the importance of understanding the mechanisms of abdominal fat gain in women. Currently, there 
is very limited knowledge (1 prospective cohort study) in humans of the poten tial gonadal regulation of 
spontaneous physical activity. In this context, the proposed study has the potential to reveal a consequence of 
the loss of ovarian function that has widespread health implications.  
3.[ADDRESS_472859] (DSMB) is as follows (from the SF424 guide):  
“NIH specifically requires the establishment of Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) for multi -site 
clinical trials involving interventions that entail potentia l risk to the participants, and generally for Phase III 
clinical trials. Although Phase I and Phase II clinical trials may also need DSMBs, smaller clinical trials may not 
require this oversight format, and alternative monitoring plans may be appropriate.”  
As discussed above, the proposed study is viewed as mechanistically driven clinical research but not a ‘clinical 
trial.’ In this context and based on the NIH DSMB recommendations, we propose that safety monitoring can be 
performed by [CONTACT_5051], wi th oversight by [CONTACT_290705]. However, in the event 
that the NIH requires the assembly of an independent, external DSMB, the general guidelines would be as 
described below.  
Roles and responsibilities of  the Safety Officer  (or DSMB) 
The Safety Officer (or DSMB , if required by [CONTACT_18121])  will: 1) monitor recruitment, enrollment, and adherence of 
study participants; 2) approve criteria for modifying or discontinuing the drug or exercise interventions for 
individual subjects; and 3) review  serious adverse events (SAEs). [CONTACT_377799] and [CONTACT_377798], the 
SCOR biostatisticians, will be responsible for preparing any data sets that the Safety Officer may ask to review. 
The Safety Officer will remain blinded to treatment status unless, fo r safety reasons, it is decide d that 
knowledge of the treatment code is important.  
The objectives of the Safety Officer will be to assess the safety of the interventions and to assure the highes t 
degree of subject safety. The Safety Officer will: 1) revie w the protocol as funded and make suggestions for 
any changes (especially safety related); 2) determine appropriate adverse effect endpoints to be monitored 
and generate individual - and study -stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]; 3) review study progress and data quality; 4) de termine 
formatting for data reports; 5) review endpoints for safety and efficacy; 6) submit reports and suggestions to 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_290665]; and 7) add to or modify this list of objectives.  
Because of the nature of the study, the Safety Officer will need to  monitor safety only and not efficacy. In the 
event the Safety Officer determines that the study or a phase of the study should be stopped for reasons of 
safety, this will be communicated to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_290665]; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_377724].  
Safet y Officer meetings will address i ssues of protocol design (including any proposed changes in design, data 
management or analysis), recruitment, retention, data management, and data quality. The Safety Officer will 
summarize any information to be noted or a cted on by [CONTACT_978].  
Defining and reporting serious adverse events (SAEs)  
We will promptly notify the IRB (within 5 days of the occurrence) when unexpected SAEs (unanticipated 
problems) occur, defined as death, life threatening illness, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377725], 
congenital anomaly/birth defects, and persistent/significant disability. Any SAE that is unexpected and related 
or possibly related to the drug or other research intervention will be reported. SAEs that are unrelated to the 
research intervention will not be reported to the IRB  (however, we will report these to the Safety Officer and 
NIH if they wish to be informed). Risks that are described in the protocol and consent will not be reported  
promptly to the IRB unless they occur  more frequently or are more serious than expected. One exception to 
this rule is in the case of a death.  All deaths must be reported, whether or not the death was related to the 
research.  
In addition to following the requirements above, we anticipate that  the Safety Officer will define study -specific

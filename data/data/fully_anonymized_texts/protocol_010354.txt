1.0 Objectives
1.1Overview
The experience of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) among  Adolescents  and 
Young Adults (AYAs)  with cancer  is particularly difficult because age-related 
developmental challenges of identity,  relationships,  and vocation may add to the burden of 
cancer.  Compared to other  age-groups,  AYAs have poorer psychosocial outcomes 
including increased  anxiety and depression and poorer adherence to oral 
immunosuppressive medications.  These outcomes  may, in turn, predispose  AYAs to 
disease-related morbidity and mortality  such  as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and/or 
cancer-relapse.  A potential barrier to improving these experiences  may be that AYAs  
have few opportunities to develop the personal resources needed to handle adversity. We 
have previously developed the “Promoting Resilience in Stress Management”  (PRISM) 
intervention for AYAs with serious  illness.  This manualized, brief intervention is delivered 
in 4, 30-60  minute, one-on-one sessions, followed by a Parent/ Caregiver/ Spouse/  
significant other inclusive meeting.  It targets  skills in stress-management and 
mindfulness, goal-setting,  positive reframing,  and meaning-making.  All of these skills are 
associated with improved  patient well-being in other  populations,  and preliminary findings 
from a recently closed pi[INVESTIGATOR_493480]-related quality of life.  This 
study will build on our prior experience and fill a critical knowledge gap regarding PRISM’s  
impact among AYAs receiving HCT.   Thus, we will conduct a multi-site randomized  
controlled trial among N=70 AYAs (n=35 PRISM and n=35 usual care; ages 12-24 years), 
with the primary trial outcome of patient-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression.   
Secondary outcomes will include  the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in this 
population and the impact  of the intervention  on parent  well-being.   Exploratory outcomes 
will assess patient adherence to oral GVHD  medications, as well as three  biomedical 
variables associated with psychological distress; heart rate variability (HRV), days to 
neutrophil engraftment (DNE), and development of acute GVHD.  We hypothesize that 
AYAs who receive  PRISM will report  fewer  mixed affective symptoms, demonstrate better  
adherence, and show  improved biomedical  outcomes, while  their parents  report improved 
quality of life and psychological  distress.  We also anticipate the intervention  will be cost-
effective.  In sum, this study offers an opportunity to expand the body of knowledge 
regarding methodologically rigorous and evidence-based psychosocial interventions and 
standards of care for AYAs with hematologic  and other malignancies.  Ultimately, this 
research has the potential to reduce the burden of cancer in these vulnerable populations.

1.6 Rationale for the Selection  of Outcome Measures
The primary outcome (patient-reported anxiety  and depression symptoms) was selected 
not only because  it is a prevalent  and clinically important  element of AYA wellbeing  
during and after HCT, but also because our pi[INVESTIGATOR_493482].  Additional AYA patient-reported 
outcomes were selected because they are clinically relevant norms in psychosocial 
intervention research.  Our prior experience suggests PRISM is associated with 
improved quality of life, hope, and resilience, for example, and the present study will 
confirm if these findings are generalizable in this new population of youth receiving HCT.   
We chose to measure  cost-effectiveness with cost per QALY because this ratio has 
established thresholds with which to define  value.  We  will capture additional measures 
of cost-effectiveness  (e.g.,  cost as a function of anxiety/depression and cost-
effectiveness for various levels of adherence)) in order to inform  future  clinical  guidelines 
and research.  Prior evidence suggests  that parent and child outcomes are strongly 
correlated; it is thus important to determine  if a child-centered intervention  can also 
improve parent outcomes  and experiences.  Emerging data indicate anxiety and 
depression can impact cancer-related outcomes through immune-mediated  
mechanisms.  Neutrophil engraftment and GVHD  are both immunologic phenomena that 
have been associated with psychological disposition in the HCT literature, and are 
documented as part of clinical standard  of care.  HRV is a commonly used, noninvasive 
stress biomarker with published normative values. The “Conserved Transcriptional  
Response to Adversity (CTRA)”  RNA  transcription pattern is observed following  
exposure to stress, and results in increased  inflammation, which  is an important 
mediator of acute  and chronic  co-morbidities.   Lastly, adherence was selected as a 
clinically important exploratory  outcome  because  of its potential impact on late effects 
including GVHD.  
2.0 Background
2.1 Prior Literature and Previous  Studies
2.1.1 Outcomes and Barriers  to Improvement among Adolescents and Young 
Adults with Cancer
Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs)  with cancer have high risks of poor 
physical and psychosocial  outcomes,  perhaps  because cancer disrupts  normal 
developmental experiences  like establishment of independence, identification of 
Site Principal Researcher: Mallory Taylor, MD, MS
Protocol  Version  Number:  17 
Protocol Version Date: 11/28/2023
Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template Version: February  [ADDRESS_635030] ongoing challenges including physical 
impairment, psychological distress, infertility, and discrimination  in employment 
and insurance.18-20  These challenges impair  survivors’  abilities to contribute to 
society. Compared to adults without a history  of cancer, AYA survivors have 
projected annual  excess medical expenditures of $3170  and annual productivity 
losses of $2250 per person.21  Extrapolating these  costs across the lifetime of 
AYAs implies excessive  societal economic  burdens.   Targeting AYA well-being 
may therefore improve AYA and societal outcomes.22  
A potential  explanation is that AYAs lack skills to navigate the adversities of 
cancer.  Positive psychological resources may mitigate negative and facilitate 
positive outcomes.23,24 “Resilience”  is evidenced  by [CONTACT_493532]-being  after significant stress.25  The study of resilience in cancer 
has lacked consensus of either definitions or outcomes indicative of 
resilience.25,26  However, several personal  resources are consistently associated 
with resilience among  AYAs and older  adults with cancer,24,27,28 and among 
parents of children with cancer.29,30  These include stress-management, problem-
solving and goal-setting skills, benefit-finding, and the ability to make  meaning 
from adversity.  We term this group of variables “resilience resources.”  
Bio-behavioral models suggest  that resilience resources relate to long-
term quality of life, health  behaviors, immune function, and overall  health  
and well-being.[ADDRESS_635031] 
greater optimism and lower anxiety  was associated with accelerated 
neutrophil engraftment following transplant.   Genome science studies are 
beginning to map out the underlying molecular pathways responsible for 
these interrelated mental and physical health outcomes in cancer.  Acute 
or chronic  stress can induce a conserved  transcriptional response to 
adversity (CTRA)  gene expression profile  - a systematic shift in gene 
expression that results  in increased expression of genes involved in 
inflammation.32-[ADDRESS_635032] setting. Hence, skills-
based interventions  bolstering these resilience resources may improve 
both psychosocial and biological  disease outcomes.31 
These resources are particularly important  in the setting of Hematopoietic  Cell 
Transplantation (HCT).  AYAs receiving HCT experience  high burdens  of medical 
morbidity and mortality,  and comparatively poor health-related quality  of life.35-42  
Anxiety is highly  prevalent before the transplant, and 40% of patients experience 
depressive symptoms in the 6 months that follow.  This “stress reaction” is 
associated with behavioral problems and peer isolation, and persists for a third of 
patients.43  Assisting  AYAs to navigate the early  transplant period may minimize  
escalation to significant distress.  Further, professional behavioral  health

psychosocial wellbeing  and self-efficacy  may be more  effective.43,49,53,54 
Access to early psychosocial interventions  is limited.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_493483],55-60 barriers  remain.  These include diverse models of assessment, 
service delivery, and staffing.55  Pediatric cancer centers differ in size and 
location; they have variable, often limited,  resources and funding for psychosocial 
services.57,61,62  Some  may not treat a sufficient number of patients  to justify the 
costs of a comprehensive multidisciplinary team.61,62  While  centers  may provide  
training for staff to effectively support patients and families (e.g., workshops on 
empathic listening,  communication, problem-solving,  and health  literacy),63-65 
standardized, evidence-based, developmentally-appropriate interventions for 
AYAs with cancer  are not well described.16,55, 56,66-68  
Practical challenges limit the success of traditional behavioral interventions.   
Time-commitments associated with traditional psychological interventions like 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be prohibitive for AYAs.   The average 
refusal rate for CBT in adolescent chronic  disease  settings is 37%; subsequent 
attrition is up to 32%.[ADDRESS_635037]

provides an 
excellent platform for 
intervention development.  This theory 
suggests three 
categories of 
resources to 
maintain psychological well-being during and after 
serious illness: 
(1) dispositional  
factors (e.g.,  optimism); (2) situational  factors (e.g.,  stress-management and 
goal-setting skills); and, (3) copi[INVESTIGATOR_493484] (e.g.,  
cognitive reframing). Among older  adults with cancer, stress-management shows 
promise at the beginning,83 middle,84 and end of treatment,85 and meaning-
making may improve quality of life.86  Among well AYAs, individual  differences in 
goal-seeking and problem-solving  are associated with psychosocial well-being.87 
Among AYAs with chronic disease, positive  re-appraisal of stressors  reduces 
distress, improves adherence,87 and optimizes quality of life.88,89 
2.1.2 The Promoting Resilience in Stress Management  (PRISM) intervention
Our central  hypothesis is that promoting  resilience  resources will improve 
outcomes for AYAs and their families.  We followed a stepwise approach  to 
testing this hypothesis.  
Concept and survey development. First, we conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-
methods study  to explore  the construct  of resilience in pediatric and AYA 
oncology.  Qualitative  findings directed the development a conceptual 
framework30 and a survey  comprised  of validated instruments to measure 
corresponding patient-centered outcomes [the “Resilience in Pediatric  Cancer 
Assessment” (RPCA)].29,30, 90 Quantitative  findings confirmed associations 
between lower resilience  resources and higher distress, lower social function, 
and poorer health behaviors.29

Prospective study of AYA perceptions of resilience.   Second, in the “Resilience 
in Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer” study, we collected survey  data 
and conducted  consecutive 1:[ADDRESS_635040] during the study.   Thematic analyses suggested that 
AYAs endorse the need for strong resilience resources, but that they lack the 
skills.  Specifically, AYAs  stated stress-management, goal-setting skills, “staying 
positive,” and “making  meaning” from adversity were  essential to their well-
being.28  
Intervention Development.  These  studies provided rationale for the design of a 
novel intervention to promote  resilience resources, the “Promoting Resilience in 
Stress Management” (PRISM, Table 1).93 PRISM is based on stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_493485] (Figure 1),82 our prior research, and successful interventions described in 
other populations.  It is manualized (i.e., it has been  standardized  via 
comprehensive protocols).  The initial  design was refined with expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_493486], psychologists, and social workers.  Details  are 
described below.  Briefly, PRISM’s  overall  objective  is to increase resilience 
resources at times of high stress,  thereby [CONTACT_493533].  
Feasibility and Acceptability study of PRISM Intervention.   We completed a 
formative study of PRISM  among 24 AYAs  to determine the optimal content and 
timing of PRISM sessions.  We found it to be feasible and highly valuable  to AYA 
patients and parents.93 Eighty percent of AYA participants completed the 
intervention and feedback was universally positive: “This was so helpful, I wish 
we had done this sooner,” or “I think it’s good techniques to use, definitely.  I am 
teaching my little sister.  I’m sure it can help her, too.”
PRISM Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 02340884).  Next,  in a phase II RCT 
testing PRISM  efficacy among AYAs with new or recurrent cancer, we refined 
processes of enrollment, randomization, implementation, and data collection.   We 
completed our target enrollment  ahead of schedule;  enrollment rates were  78%.  Table 1. PRISM intervention content

Attrition (20%) was similar on the PRISM and usual care arms, and primarily due 
to medical complications.   
The primary  objective of the phase II RCT was to assess  patient-reported  
resilience. Final analyses suggest PRISM improved patient reported resilience 
and quality of life, and reduced  psychological distress (Table 2).

and inpatient wards  of Seattle Cancer Care  Alliance (Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493488]),Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7723] (CHLA),  St. 
Jude Children’s Research  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (SJCRH),  and University of Alabama at Birmingham 
(UAB).  Research Associates (RAs) at each  site will screen patients via review of the 
new transplant arrivals  list, clinic  rosters  and sign-outs, communication  with clinicians, 
and attendance at HCT conferences, followed by a medical chart review to very 
eligibility. 
For Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493489], recruitment will be conducted as follows: 
The study will be initially  introduced  to eligible families  through  either a study information 
flyer or opt-out letter. When possible, BMT  clinic staff will distribute flyers to patients  on 
intake day with the message that “someone  will be contact[CONTACT_493534]” message. RAs will then conduct  in-person recruitment in clinic waiting rooms, at 
clinic visits  and/or inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60916]. RAs will then discuss the project with 
patients and their parents and answer questions.  Consent conference may be conducted 
directly following the approach  or at a later date, depending on family preference.  
Phone-based recruitment methods will be used in cases where in-person recruitment is 
not possible/feasible. This includes  instances  when in-person interaction  would pose 
infection risk to patients (e.g.,  during  COVID-19 pandemic), instances where patients 
are coming to clinic  infrequently, or when  in-person  recruitment may cause unnecessary 
subject burden and obtaining consent by [CONTACT_648]/video would achieve the same purpose 
without reducing  subject informedness. This includes instances such  as providers 
interrupting the consent conference, when the day is “not good” for the family to be 
approached, or when illness status  in which the patient is not cognitively able to provide 
consent/assent that day. In these instances, eligible patients (or parents, when patient  is 
under 18) will be mailed a letter or sent an e-mail introducing them  to the study and 
giving them the opportunity to “opt out” of future  contact [CONTACT_493535]. If potentially  eligible 
patients who receive the mailing do not opt-out  of being approached about the study, an 
RA will then call them to assess interest. RAs will call a maximum of six times until 
contact [CONTACT_58661], with a maximum  of [ADDRESS_635042] is made  (i.e., 
having a conversation), follow up calls or texts will only occur if the family expresses 
interest in the study or requests a callback. Once they contact  [CONTACT_192386], the RA will use 
a phone approach script  to explain the study.  If the family is interested,  the RA will e-mail  
or mail a copy of the consent form to the family and schedule a later time for a 
phone/video consent conference. Should  families  approached via phone  prefer  to 
continue to discuss the study or consent in person, we will arrange a follow-up 
conversation regarding the study  at the time of their clinic or inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493490]: Mallory Taylor, MD, MS
Protocol  Version  Number:  17 
Protocol Version Date: 11/28/2023
Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template Version: February  [ADDRESS_635043] is made with a family via a non-text method.
Consent conferences  will be conducted in a private  consult room,  clinic room or in the 
patient room (in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) or via phone or videoconference. Videoconference will only be 
used if specifically requested by [CONTACT_2299], via WebEx or Zoom. Videoconference or 
phone-based consent conferences will NOT be recorded. Patients and families will be 
given an addendum to the consent  form to participate in the optional  heart rate 
variability,CTRA gene expression (blood  draw),  or medication adherence monitoring 
components of the study.  We will emphasize  there will be no penalties if patients  or 
families opt out of the optional portions of the study. These optional procedures  will be 
presented at the time of the consent conference.  All patients fulfilling eligibility criteria will 
be eligible for the HRV and CTRA components of the study. Only patients  receiving  
allogeneic HCT will be eligible for the medication adherence monitoring component. . 
Parents do not take part in the optional components. In cases  where it is necessary to 
minimize in-person  contact [CONTACT_493536] (e.g., during 
COVID-19 pandemic), the HRV component  will not offered and families will be verbally 
informed of this justification.  
We recognize potential  risks for adolescents  involved in recruitment; there  could be 
embarrassment or discomfort for adolescents if asked to participate.  Adolescents  may 
feel coercion to be part of the study. To mitigate  these  risks,  we will emphasize the 
voluntary nature of the study to adolescents and parents and that the study will in no 
way impact or influence  clinical care.  We will let adolescents know that their information 
will be kept confidential and that qualitative interview  transcripts  will be de-identified and 
audio recordings destroyed after transcribing.  We will let adolescents know that they can 
change their mind about participating and may decide to withdraw  from the study at any 
time. 
Each of the participating sites has significant  experience with clinic recruitment  for 
studies and has developed processes to ensure best practices  for participant 
recruitment. These procedures and scripts  also emphasize that any potential coercion 
on the part of parents  should not take place, and that adolescents’ decision for or 
against participation in the study  does not affect the clinical care they receive.
The investigators and staff will be available to answer any questions  from potential 
participants via phone or email throughout the study. We will emphasize that the 
decision of whether or not to be part of this study  does not affect participants’ 
involvement in the PRISM study,  or their ongoing  care at their respective institutions.

Number of subjects: We will enroll  and randomize a total of n=90 AYAs from the four sites in 
order to reach our target  n=70 of evaluable patients  with complete data at the primary endpoint  
(Table 3).  Note that both AYA patients  and their parents/legal guardians  will be enrolled when 
possible in order to collect accurate costing data.   The rationale is that much of the day-to-day 
costs such as transportation and missed  work  will be experienced by [CONTACT_493537].  
 
5.0 Study-Wide  Recruitment  Methods
All recruitment methods will be conducted and overseen by [CONTACT_493538].  
There are no study-wide recruitment methods (e.g.,  no call centers or national  
advertisements); however, the trial will be listed at clinicaltrials.gov and therefore identified 
by [CONTACT_493539].  
6.0 Multi-Site  Research
6.1 Enrolling  sites. We will recruit  consecutive AYAs and their primary caregivers from 
outpatient clinics and inpatient  wards at the Seattle Cancer Care  Alliance (Seattle 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493493]), Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493494] (CHLA), St. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (SJCRH) and University of 
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The lead study team member  from SCH will travel to 
each participating site for site initiation where study teams  will participate in minimum a 
day long training.
6.2 Coordinating site responsibilities. The Seattle lead CRA will ensure the following:

enrollment, intervention delivery, data completion,  and protocol adherence. She will also be 
involved in monthly  multisite calls to maintain up to date on study progress.
Seattle Children’s will remain  the coordinating center and maintain the following 
responsibilities on [CONTACT_401480]’s behalf. The SCH lead CRA  will have at minimum 
monthly meetings  with each site to review  and troubleshoot trial conduct and questions, 
including (but not limited to) regulatory  oversight, recruitment, data collection, intervention 
delivery, clinical concerns  and/or other concerns.  The lead CRA will review current 
documents and any changes  that are upcoming  or approved.  The lead CRA will review 
any interim results or necessary information  the sites should have as well as all study 
procedures, including  modifications, updates, study  closure, etc. The DFCI (Junkins)  lead 
interventionist will have  at minimum twice monthly  meetings with interventionists to 
administer re-training as needed and review  intervention delivery  and fidelity.  A lead SCH 
study team member  will conduct  yearly on-site  or remote monitoring of participating  sites 
for review of study documents and databases.  This will include verification of 
consent/assent forms, documentation  of eligibility,  completeness of Case Report Forms 
(CRFs), and regulatory submissions and approvals.

9.0 Procedures Involved
9.1  Enrollment . Once consent documents are signed and all questions  addressed,  the 
consenting RA or study staff will register the patient  in the RedCap System.  
Randomization will not occur until after the baseline Resilience in Pediatric  Cancer 
Assessment (RPCA) surveys  are collected (see below).  Site  RAs will maintain original 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_493495]/email  copi[INVESTIGATOR_493496].   
9.2 Randomization. 
As a quality control measure, a randomization log will be maintained at SCH to track the 
participant ID, stratum, randomized assignment, and date of randomization.   Patients will 
be randomized only after completion of the baseline surveys and in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
usual, non-directive,  supportive care without PRISM  (“control” arm) or with PRISM  
(“experimental” arm).  Randomization  will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (patients ages 12-[ADDRESS_635051] data analysis will be 
blinded from the treatment group allocations. Throughout the screening period until 
allocation of the control or PRISM, participants will be assigned  a screening number, 
according to the chronological order of screening. Once enrolled, the participant will be 
assigned a study ID. 
9.3 Scheduling of study procedures with participants.  
9.3.1 Baseline Survey  Completion Upon enrollment, study staff will deliver the 
baseline survey  in participant’s preferred language (English  or Spanish). For both

complete the survey at that time,  they will be removed from the study.  For those 
who do complete the survey, following completion,  staff at each site will receive 
their randomization allocation.  They will then return to patients and families to 
relay this information and create a study  calendar outlining survey  due-dates  
and, where relevant,  PRISM sessions.  Where relevant, PRISM-sessions will be 
scheduled approximately every other week,  beginning within  the first week of 
enrollment.
9.4 Overview and Session Details of Intervention Arm.  
The original  Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) intervention consists 
of four, 30-50 minute, one-on-one, in-person sessions approximately  1-2 weeks apart 
plus a 5th session for AYA and selected  parent/caregiver/ spouse/significant  other  
together (Table 1).  Supplemental materials (e.g., media-links to resources, worksheets, 
text-based reminders, and a digital app to track and practice skills) are provided  between 
sessions. The digital  app is an interactive  platform to practice  the same PRISM  
exercises that are taught during the in-person sessions with the same intervention script 
(please see training manual and fidelity document for script).  To increase translation 
and wider application of PRISM in the future, a trained non-clinical research associate 
administers it, as described in previous models  and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].93,[ADDRESS_635054] session 
occurs within  2 weeks of enrollment.   Other sessions are scheduled around patient clinic  
and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56877] (depending on concurrent  illness and medical  needs).  Following 
the 5th session, intervention participants will be offered every other week  “booster” 
contacts until they reach  the 6 month point from enrollment.  Although  in person visits 
are preferred, if a patient explicitly requests or if scheduling barriers preclude in-person 
visits, all sessions and boosters may be done via phone or other web based 
communication (i.e., zoom, WebEx, skype,  blue jeans, go to meetings, WhatsApp, etc.) .
Details of the sessions are listed in Table 1.  Briefly, session 1 (“Stress-management”) 
focuses on mindfulness  skills including deep  breathing and relaxation techniques, and 
building awareness  and acceptance  of stressors.  Session 2 (“Goal  setting”) teaches  
simple goal-setting skills (e.g., identifying realistic, concrete and actionable goals, 
planning steps towards their achievement, preparing for roadblocks and identifying 
alternative pathways).   Session 3 (“Cognitive Restructuring”)  trains patients to recognize  
negative emotions and demoralizing self-talk  and helps them  develop  skills to reframe  
these in a positive light.  Session 4 (“Benefit Finding”) focuses on finding  meaning and/or 
benefitting from difficult situations (including their cancer).   
Site Principal Researcher: Mallory Taylor, MD, MS

Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template Version: February  2016  
Page  23 of 64
The final 5th session  (“Coming together”) allows patients to reflect on the skills they have 
learned, to identify those  that resonate and work for them,  and to share  their thoughts  
with parents. During this last session, selected parent(s)/caregiver(s)/ spouse/significant  
others are explicitly asked to join and listen  to the discussion.  Study personnel  will 
review and share with parents/caregivers/  spouse/significant others  the explicit skills 
endorsed by [CONTACT_493543]/caregiver/spouses/significant others and the patients can support one another.  
For families where parents prefer Spanish or another non-English language, this final 
session will be conducted with a certified  interpreter of the native  language  of the parent. 
In the phase II RCT,  the majority of the PRISM  arm opted into the fifth session even 
though it was an optional study  procedure in that study (n = 38 out of 40 who completed 
all four PRISM sessions).  However,  patients  may still opt out of the coming together  
session if they request  to do so explicitly.  We will continue  to follow them  and offer an 
optional booster session with the interventionist in lieu of the parent/caregiver/ 
spouse/significant other inclusive meeting in these cases. Additionally, the coming 
together session  may not be feasible if the parent/caregiver/spouse/significant  other has 
not agreed to be a part of the study.  In such cases, we will re-offer  participation in real 
time.  If parents/caregivers/ spouse/significant  other still decline, then we will skip the 
parent/caregiver/spouse/significant other inclusive meeting.  
Sessions may be combined (maximum 2 sessions per meeting) based on patient  
preference/research discretion for reasons including (but not limited  to): illness  
severity/progression or patient availability. 
All of the sessions  of the PRISM will be audio-recorded as possible,  barring  issues with 
the recorder or refusal  of the patient  to be recorded. Administrators of the PRISM will 
explain that the sessions will be taped and reviewed  by [CONTACT_493544], inclusion of required elements, and 
presence/absence of additional information  with the exception of the feedback 
questions. As possible, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_493497]’s will 
review the first of each  [ADDRESS_635055], and score them for fidelity 
using a standardized tool (see appendix.). After the first [ADDRESS_635056], one of each 5 subsequent sessions will be randomly selected  to be 
monitored for fidelity, with feedback and re-training  regarding adherence to protocol  and 
approach will be refined if needed.    
Participants on the intervention arm will be offered every other week “booster” contacts 
until they reach the 6 month  point  from enrollment. These will include brief (10-20 
minute) in-person contacts in clinic, in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  by [CONTACT_493545] (i.e., zoom, WebEx, skype,  blue jeans, go to meetings, WhatsApp, etc.)  
by [CONTACT_6968], or by [CONTACT_493546] (at the patient’s  discretion).  Study  staff will contact [CONTACT_493547]: “Would you like to review or practice any of 
the resilience skills?” [If needed,  staff will remind patients of all 4 sessions.  If patients 
are willing,  study staff will ask,] “Which  one?”

Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template Version: February  [ADDRESS_635057] that will be provided by [CONTACT_493548].. The app includes digital content  of all paper-pencil “cheat  sheets” and 
worksheets (see manual in appendix  for both paper  versions and screen-shots  of app).  
Participants will be given access to both types of materials.  Use of the app is optional  
for study  participation.  Where relevant (i.e., for participants  without a smartphone), we 
will provide  iPads to be used in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225].  Note  these participants may need to 
establish email account  for such purposes if they do not already have one. 
Each site’s  interventionist(s) will be responsible for delivering PRISM to their site’s 
participants in the majority of cases.  In rare circumstances (e.g., interim coverage for 
unexpected lapses in staffing), trained interventionists from SCH may deliver sessions to 
other sites’  participants  pending approval  from the site’s IRB. In these instances, the site 
coordinator will be responsible for scheduling  the session and setting up a video-
conference using the site’s own HIPAA compliant  software  (i.e., Zoom, WebEx) for 
session delivery. Thus,  no contact [CONTACT_493549].  At the start of the session, the site coordinator 
will briefly  join the video  call in order introduce  to the patient and SCH interventionist 
using first names only. Any correspondence between site coordinators and SCH 
interventionists regarding session scheduling  will use study ID numbers only.  
9.5 MEMS cap and adherence assessments.
For patients who are eligible and consent  to the optional medication adherence 
monitoring portion  of the study, we will use the medication electronic monitoring system 
(MEMS) monitoring  device to evaluate real-time  medication adherence for oral 
immunosuppressive medications (standard  prophylaxis against Graft-Versus-Host  
Disease [GVHD]).  The MEMS system employs  a microelectronic technology  to record  
actual medication  vial openings (date  and time) as a measure of dosing.  It is widely  
considered the gold standard  of medication-adherence methodology.96,[ADDRESS_635058] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493498] 6 months on study, participants will store 
prescriptions for their primary GVHD prophylaxis (typi[INVESTIGATOR_493499]), in study-dispensed  MEMS bottles and caps.  A patient supply kit 
containing a MEMS  cap and bottle will be dispensed  to all study participants by [CONTACT_493550] 7-[ADDRESS_635059]-discharge to verify new prescription has 
been dispensed in these  bottles and to review procedures.  A study coordinator  will

questions or concern the patient  may be having.
The following  instructions  will be included in the patient supply kit: 
1.In the next [ADDRESS_635061] the regular cap with the MEMS TrackCap you 
received in your study kit.  
3.All doses of your GVHD medication should be taken from the MEMS 
medication bottle  with the MEMS TrackCap while  you are on this study. 
4.Please take your GVHD medication  exactly as your doctor  has ordered.
5.Open the medication bottle ONLY when it is time for you to take your GVHD 
medication.
6.Close the medication bottle right after taking the GVHD medication.
To refill your GVHD medication while on this study, follow these instructions.  
Only refill your medication when you need to take a dose of your GVHD 
medication!
•Open the old bottle and take out a dose of medication.
•Refilled bottle with your GVHD medication using your prescription 
bottle from your pharmacy.  
•Replace the electronic Trackcap onto the newly refilled bottle of 
your GVHD medication.
•Please do not refill or open your MEMS cap when you are not 
taking your medicine.
If medications are dispensed  in a blister package, if possible, study participants will be 
asked to place  blister packages into medication  bottles  and take as above.  Because 
most AYAs can take tablets, use of liquid formulations will be rare.  However,  when 
indicated or requested by [CONTACT_1962], pharmacists  will dispense oral, crushable tablets for 
compounding.  Those study participants will, however, be asked to open their MEMS 
bottle at the same time as taking their GVHD  medication.   Patients  will be instructed not 
to open the container unless taking a dose of the medication and to remove only the 
prescribed dose. After  the final [ADDRESS_635062] data will be collected monthly 
(Figure 3).  Details about staff-data  collection are as follows:

prescription details including medication-name, frequency, and dosing.  
9.6.2 Health  care utilization.  The Case Report  Form (CRF, appendix) will capture  the 
following variables through medical records and billing systems: (1) Intervention 
time: visit time related to case management and PRISM sessions; (2) mental

collecting biomarker data (i.e., heart rate variability and/or blood samples)  will 
abstract additional clinical covariates to provide needed context as to the 
conditions under which the corresponding  biologic  data were collected. These 
data will only be collected for participants  who consented to the HRV and/or 
CTRA optional components of the study. Sites collecting  heart rate variability  
(HRV) data will abstract the following clinical information for participating 
patients: cardiac medications, diagnostic cardiac  test data, and patient  weight, 
height, and Body Mass Index (MBI). Sites collecting blood samples will abstract 
the following  information for participating  patients: date of conditioning 
chemotherapy and/or radiation start,  transplant date, and blood  test information. 
9.7 Resilience in Pediatric Cancer Assessment  (RPCA)  Survey  (both arms):
Patient (and parent)  reported outcomes (PROs) will be measured with the Resilience  in 
Pediatric Cancer Assessment (RPCA), a comprehensive survey comprised of age-
appropriate validated  instruments (Table 5).  The RPCA was designed with AYA and 
parent stakeholders to capture patient-reported  outcomes associated with resilience 
resources.[ADDRESS_635065]  demographics 
(age, sex, and race/ethnicity, education, income, number of children in the home).  
The full RPCA survey  will be administered to patients and parents at baseline,  month  3 
and month  6 (Figure 3).  In order to optimize engagement, parents in both arms of the 
study will be asked to complete the abbreviated Resilience in Pediatric  Cancer 
Assessment (aRPCA) at months 1, 2, 4, and 5.  The aRPCA  will assess only cost-
consequences, as described below. In the rare case that a patient is their own money 
manager, AYA patients will be asked to complete cost-consequence questionnaires at 
each month  in lieu of parents. RPCA and aRPCA surveys will be administered  via 
REDCap or pencil-and-paper, depending  on participant preference. If administered  via 
REDCap, participants will be sent an email containing the survey  link. Email language 
will include  all text described in the IRB-approved  template  (see “PRISM BMT  Survey 
letter – REDCAP”) though additional  personalized text may be included  to reflect 
participants’ specific needs. Paper-and-pencil  surveys will be delivered in-person or via 
mail. If patients or parents  specifically request to opt-out of aRPCA  surveys (i.e., cost 
consequences assessments), study staff will no longer administer aRPCA  surveys for 
the remainder of the study. In these  cases,  patients/parents will remain  eligible to 
complete RPCA surveys. 
For those on the non-intervention  arm of the study,  staff will schedule  a “study check-in”  
visit to coordinate the aRPCA completion  and thank  families  for their continued 
participation. If patients and parents  have  not completed any interval study 
questionnaires, we will still invite them to complete  the [ADDRESS_635066] completed. If patients and parents

are reluctant  to fill out the full RPCA at 3 month  and/or  6 months, we will offer a 
shortened RPCA assessing the primary outcomes only. If patients are still reluctant to 
complete the questionnaire due to length,  we will provide a HADS only questionnaire 
option. Patients  and parents will be given up to 4 weeks to complete the 6 month  
questionnaire before deemed ‘off study’.  
In both arms of the study, if any participant declines to complete the full RPCA  survey 
and/or if participants  or family members report participants are unable to complete the 
survey due to illness complications,  staff will offer in the following order: (a) an in-person 
(English-speaking, interview based) survey session,  and (b) abbreviated version 
(primary outcome only – HADS questionnaire  only) of the questionnaire for patients to 
complete.  Only in cases where participants  are too ill to provide self report  in writing or 
interviews, staff will offer abbreviated versions of the survey  for parents to complete as 
proxy respondents. These proxy questionnaires  would be the patient questionnaire given 
to the parent  to complete on behalf  of their child.  In such cases  of proxy-completion of 
surveys, staff will note this distinction in the database and proxy-completion  will be 
included as a potential confounding variable  in subsequent analyses.  These  options will 
be offered in an effort to collect full data for primary endpoint assessment.   
Participants in both arms of the study  will be scheduled for their surveys at the time of 
enrollment and then reminded 1 week  and 2 days prior to each survey due-date. 
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_493552], by [CONTACT_648], email, text or mail to receive their 
RPCA/aRPCA surveys. If we have  not received a response within a day of initial  contact, 
participants will receive up to 4 follow-up phone  calls,  texts or emails  (approximately  
once weekly) within a 28 day window before and after surveys are due.  Follow-up 
surveys not received within  28 days of their due-date will be considered missing.  
Participants will remain eligible for subsequent survey completion  and follow-up even if 
surveys are missing and the same procedures will be conducted  for each survey due-
date.

9.8     RPCA  item details
9.8.1 AYA Version (not included  in parent surveys)
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS).  The  HADS  assesses  
mixed affective  symptoms in patients  with serious illness.1  It has been  
validated in AYAs with chronic illness105 as well as AYA cancer survivors.106  
The scale has excellent reliability (α=0.83-0.82).1  It consists  of 7 questions 
for anxiety and 7 for depression.  Each  is scored from 0-3, for a total range  
of 0-21 points per subscale.  “Caseness” of anxiety  and depression  is 
defined as ≥8 points, with sensitivity/specificity of 0.8/0.9  for anxiety  and 
0.8/0.8 for depression.1  This instrument will be included  in the full (non-
abbreviated) RPCA  survey  as well as the 3 and 6 month  shortened RPCA.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). The MSAS  measures 
the presence, severity, frequency, and extent  of bother from 26 symptoms  
with high consistency (α>0.8).2,107  For this study, we will use a version  of 
the MSAS that has been previously developed for and used  among  children 
with advanced cancer.98,108 Likert scales assess physical (pain, fatigue, 
drowsiness, nausea, anorexia,  cough,  diarrhea, vomiting, itching,  skin 
issues, constipation, dysphagia,  dry mouth,  numbness,  sweating, dyspnea,  
and dysuria), and psychological  (irritability, sleep disturbance, nervousness, 
sadness, worrying, difficulty  concentrating, and image  issues)  symptoms.   
Total- and sub-scores  are calculated as an average, with higher scores 
representing higher symptom burden.  This  instrument  will only be included 
only in full (non-abbreviated) RPCA surveys.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pediatric  Quality of Life (PedsQL) Generic and Cancer Module  Teen  
Reports. The PedsQL 4.[ADDRESS_635068] been used successfully  with low 
rates of refusal  and minimal missing data.109 Items are rated  on a 5-point  
Likert scale  and total scores transformed to a 0-100 scale with higher 
scores representing better HRQOL.  Internal consistency  ranges  from 0.75 
to 0.92.4  This  instrument will only be included only in full (non-abbreviated)  
RPCA surveys.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hope Scale. The Snyder  “Hope”  Scale contains 8 hope items plus 4 “filler” 
questions, and measures “the overall perception that one’s goals can be 
met.”5  The instrument was named based on patterns  of hopeful thought  
and assesses  patient-reported efficacy  by [CONTACT_493553] 
a route to one’s  goals  (termed  “pathway” thoughts) and the ability to initiate 
and maintain the actions necessary to reach  a goal (termed “agency”

thoughts).  Prior studies performed among AYA cancer patients have 
shown that high-hope individuals have improved psychosocial outcomes.  
The instrument has been validated in both adult and pediatric settings and 
is scored on an 8-point  Likert scale.  Higher  scores  imply greater levels  of 
hopeful thought patterns.  Cronbach’s  alphas  for the whole  scale range 
from .74 to 0.84.  This instrument will only be included only full (non-
abbreviated) RPCA  surveys.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. The Connor-Davidson Resilience 
Scale (CD-RISC) is a reliable and widely used  instrument  to measure 
inherent resiliency.6 Questions revolve  around personal problem-solving  
and approaches  to adversity.   The 10-item instrument  has high internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.85), and has been used  in diverse  
populations including adolescents, parents and cancer  patients.6,[ADDRESS_635069] evaluated the scale with other  psychosocial 
measures such as psychological distress,111 PTSD,112 and social support.113  
It also has been used  in pharmacologic and other  intervention  studies  to 
model modifiable outcomes  Each item consists of a 5-point  Likert scale 
(scored from zero to four) for total of 40 points.   The  mean score  among  
well US adults  is 31.8,  with higher scores reflecting  greater  resilience   This 
instrument will only be included only full (non-abbreviated) RPCA  surveys. 
9.8.2 Both AYA and Parent Version
[IP_ADDRESS] Health Utilities Index (HUI).  The HUI is a multi-attribute preference-based  
health-status classification system  validated in AYA cancer populations.100-
104  The index consists of 15 total queries to assess 2 systems  - cognition, 
emotion, fertility,  mobility,  pain, self-care, and sensation (HUI2);  and, 
ambulation, cognition, dexterity, hearing,  emotion,  pain,  speech and vision 
problems (HUI3).  Scoring  is based  on standard gamble utilities, with 
scores from 0 (health-state preference  equivalent to death) to 1 (perfect 
health).  Parents will be asked  to complete the survey as a proxy for their 
AYA participant.  Patient data will be used unless  unavailable; only in cases 
where patient data is unavailable  will parent proxy data be used  for data 
analysis.  This  instrument will be included  in the full (non-abbreviated)  
RPCA surveys  as well as the 3 and 6 month shortened  RPCAs.    
[IP_ADDRESS] The COVID-[ADDRESS_635070]  Questionnaire. (COVID-IQ) This 7-item, self-report 
questionnaire was developed for this study  to assess perceived impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic on AYAs and parents. Items assess  worry/anxiety 
related to COVID-19, life events as a result of COVID-19 (e.g.,  loss of job, 
missed school),  lifestyle changes (e.g., social distancing),  and known 
COVID-19 symptoms/diagnoses/treatments of self and family  members.  
Respondents are invited to provide  free text responses for two additional 
items: 1) “What  is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_493500]-19 pandemic”  and 2) 
“Please tell us about other effects of COVID-19 on yourself,  your child(ren)  
and/or your family, both negative and/or positive.” Lastly, respondents  are

will be included  in the patient and parent RPCA surveys. 
9.8.3. Parent Version  (not included in AYA  surveys)
[IP_ADDRESS] Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener  (GAD-7). This 7-item survey  is 
commonly used to identify cases of generalized anxiety disorder  and to 
assess symptom severity.9,[ADDRESS_635071] been  bothered by [CONTACT_493554] 7 core symptoms  of 
generalized anxiety disorder. Response  options include  “not at all,” “several  
days.” “more than have the days,”  and “nearly every day,” scored as 0, 1, 2, 
and 3, respectively. Therefore, GAD-7 score  range  from 0 to 21, with 
scores of ≥5, ≥10, and ≥15 representing mild,  moderate,  and severe anxiety  
symptoms levels, respectively. Internal consistency was acceptable 
(α=0.89). Inter-correlations ranged  from r = 0.45 to r = 0.65.  This instrument  
will only be included only full (non-abbreviated) RPCA  surveys.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Health Questionnaire  (PHQ-8). This 8-item survey  is widely  used 
among general populations, patients with chronic illness,  and in parents of 
children with cancer.10,11, 115-[ADDRESS_635072]  
excellent psychometric properties (α=0.86-0.89).  Each item is scored on a 
4-point Likert  scale and the sum (0- 27) indicates the degree  of depression , 
with scores  of ≥5, ≥10, and ≥15 representing  mild, moderate,  and severe 
depression.  Scores correlate with functional status  and are sensitive to 
behavioral interventions.118,119   This instrument will only be included  only 
full (non-abbreviated) RPCA surveys.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical Outcomes  Study Rand 36-item  Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-
[ADDRESS_635073] widely used generic measure of HRQOL  among  U.S. 
Adults.80  It incorporates 8 concepts:  physical functioning,  body  pain,  
limitations due to physical health  problems,  role limitations  due to personal  
or emotional problems as well as emotional well-being and social  
functioning, energy,  fatigue  and general  health perceptions.  It includes  a 
single item regarding perceived  change in health.8  Internal reliability ranges

for teenaged  patients, communication and child-centered care,  and overall 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493503].  All items  are scored  on a Likert Scale (for example, to the 
question “During this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], how often did providers involve your 
child in discussions about his or her health  care?” response options include 
“Never,” “Sometimes,” “Usually,” and “Always.”  This instrument will only be 
included only full (non-abbreviated) RPCA surveys. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient costs .  A study-specific cost-of-care checklist was adapted from 
consensus guidelines for cost-effectiveness  analyses.78  It will be 
embedded within RPCA surveys  and query parent-estimates  of: (1) direct 
costs: time costs (travel/wait time, time with providers),  out-of-pocket  
expenses (gas/travel, other child-care needs); (2) indirect  costs:   time-lost 
from vocation or employment (see appendix).   It will be included in the full 
and abbreviated  surveys  (RPCA, aRPCA and the 3 and 6 month  shortened 
RPCA) in order to minimize recall bias and accurately collect  monthly 
costing data from then perspective  of parent/guardian  caregivers. Due to 
recall bias, parents will be able to complete this questionnaire  in real time 
over the course of the month. Parents will be given the questionnaire  at the 
beginning of each  month to have on hand  to complete.   If parents do not fill 
it out in real time, they will have the chance to complete  in based on recall 
during their monthly visit in their embedded RPCA/aRPCA
9.9 Optional  Procedures
9.9.1 Heart Rate  Variability Data Collection
HRV will be measured using the Actiheart 5 external device (CamnTech,  Inc, [LOCATION_006]FDA 
class 2, 510(k) number  K052489). The Actiheart 5 is an FDA-approved,  lightweight, 
wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor that attaches to a patient’s torso via two 
standard ECG electrodes. Patients who consent to the optional HRV  measurement 
portion of the study will be given their Actiheart monitor at enrollment.  A  study  team 
member (licensed medical provider or CRA with appropriate certification, per site 
requirements) will place  the monitor on the patient  (left chest)  and ensure adequate ECG  
signal acquisition OR a study CRA will instruct the patient (no physical patient contact 
[CONTACT_493555]). The patients will wear the monitor for a 24h period, and then return the 
device to a study  team  member.  The devices  will be collected at the next planned clinic 
appointment if outpatient, or the next day if inpatient.
9.9.2 Blood  Samples
Whole blood samples will be sent to the University of [LOCATION_004] Los Angeles (UCLA) 
Social Genomics Core  for transcriptome profiling using RNA sequencing.[ADDRESS_635075]’s blood. 
A total volume  of 5 ml of blood will be collected  from subjects at the time of any clinical  
blood draw or intravenous access near the planned study time point. For smaller

children, we will follow clinical  guidelines  regarding volume of blood draws. Blood 
samples needed for clinical purposes  will be prioritized  over research lab collection.   
Biospecimens (blood samples) will be temporarily stored in secure freezers  at Seattle 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493504] (RLS).  The specimens will be labeled  only 
with study identification numbers. Blood samples  will be stored until [ADDRESS_635076] 
been collected (anticipate <6 months depending on enrollment), and then will be shipped  
to the UCLA laboratory  for analysis. No biospecimens will be banked.
Following quality assurance testing of suitable  mass (Nanodrop ND1000) and integrity 
(Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA Integrity Score),  mRNA will be converted to cDNA (Illumina  
TruSeq), and >10 million  sequence reads  will be obtained on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 
instrument in the UCLA  Neuroscience Genomics  Core. 
9.9.3 Data Collection Schedule
HRV data and/or blood samples will be collected  at clinically  relevant and study  specific  
time intervals where  possible (Table 6).  When not possible,  HRV and/or blood sample 
data collection will be scheduled at the patient’s  convenience, and/or during the next 
scheduled clinical lab draw. .
10.[ADDRESS_635077], health care utilization, HRV,  blood samples, 
RPCA survey data, and audio  transcriptions will be coded and labeled  with study 
identification numbers.   All will be stored  in original (hard  copy) forms in locked cabinets 
(where relevant) and/or password-protected  secure  databases (for all electronic survey  
data) at Seattle  Children’s Research Institute. Upon completion of data collection, SCH 
will transfer the limited dataset to DFCI per the Data Transfer Agreement.  Original  
surveys will be saved at SCH for [ADDRESS_635078], in order to ensure data quality.  Coded electronically saved study 
data will be banked indefinitely for future  use by [CONTACT_493556]’s.  PIs will verify that additional  
analyses have  IRB approval. Only study  staff with human  subjects training will have 
access, subject  to approval by [CONTACT_493557], [CONTACT_29898].  No  data will be withdrawn Table 6. Biological data collection schedule

10.2 Data and/or Sample Sharing
Data will not be shared  outside the group of investigators conducting the study but will 
be fully shared during and after the study with investigators in the group.  When other 
investigators are interested in new analyses, the PIs will verify they have IRB approval to 
conduct additional analyses.  Coded  study  data will be banked indefinitely for future  use 
by [CONTACT_493558]’s.   Future studies  will formally test the dissemination and implementation potential  of 
the intervention  once  its efficacy is confirmed.  Should the intervention  be effective, the 
intervention will be made  publicly available for use by [CONTACT_493559].
11.0 Data Analysis/Management
11.1  Overview
The primary statistical analyses  will be intention-to-treat  to avoid confounding by [CONTACT_105]-
random participant attrition or crossover.  Demographics, clinical characteristics, items  
within the RPCA,  adherence  data, and costing  data will all be summarized  at each time-
point using descriptive statistics:  frequencies  and proportions for categorical  variables, 
means and standard deviations for continuous  variables,  or median and interquartile 
range if distribution is skewed.  All  analyses  will be adjusted for patient age and site, as 
randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_243633], as well as baseline characteristics clearly  
imbalanced between groups.  Additional baseline characteristics we consider as 
potential confounders include sex, race, and primary language spoken  at home.
11.2 Sample Size Determination and Power
Our focus for sample size estimation  is the primary outcome (Aim 1): mean HADS 
scores at 6-month observation. In the following table we list minimum clinically  important 
differences (MCID) for various outcomes and detectable differences  (DD) with our 
proposed sample size. Sample  size is based on preliminary  data from our Phase II RCT 
suggesting AYA HADS  scores  are normally distributed with mean score  of 11.1 
(SD=6.2).  Assuming 20% attrition, we will randomize 90 AYAs  (45 per arm) to obtain an 
evaluable sample size of 70 AYA participants (35 per arm).  This sample size achieves  
80% power to detect  a 4.2-point increase   in the mean  6-month total HADS score.  This 
means 35 per arm will provide  us >80% power to detect MCID 3.[ADDRESS_635081] the precision of estimates.

11.3 Randomization
The randomization algorithm  will be constructed by [CONTACT_378773] a 
permuted blocks scheme with randomly varying  block sizes, within strata  defined  by [CONTACT_493560].  Randomized assignments will be administered by a research associate 
using REDCap.   Randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_654] (patients ages 12-17 versus 
ages 18-24) and site. 
11.4 Analysis Plan
11.4.1 Primary Outcome (Anxiety  and Depression  [HADS scores]).  Our primary 
outcome is AYA reported total HADS score at 6 months.  Because  the amount of 
change depends strongly on the initial score at baseline  we will control for 
baseline score as a covariate in the regression. Regression models will be used 
to estimate mean-level differences and 95% confidence intervals comparing 
scores in the PRISM intervention to those in usual  care.   The total HADS score 
will be the outcome, and PRISM intervention  indicator will be the predictor of 
interest.  Baseline  HADS  score,  age group,  site and other unbalanced 
confounders will be covariates  in the regression. With this model specification, 
the regression coefficient of PRISM indicator captures the difference  in the 
average changes  (from baseline to 6 months) for the HADS score  between 
PRISM arm and usual care arm. Thus the primary hypothesis can be tested by 
[CONTACT_493561] t-test  to the regression coefficient of PRISM  indicator. The 
same analysis  will be undertaken for the domain  subscales of anxiety and

[IP_ADDRESS] Cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY). We will use a cost-
effectiveness framework to evaluate  the overall value of PRISM.[ADDRESS_635082]-analyses  will 
determine the total, per-patient, 6-month costs  of PRISM versus usual 
care. Using Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) we will  then  estimate 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
Costs will be calculated with a micro-costing approach,  multiplying 
resource use by [CONTACT_493562].[ADDRESS_635083] per visit category (e.g.,  in-person  
check-in with/without formal session), plus estimated  costs of 
intervention delivery (including  facilities and overhead).  We will add a

and assess intervention value, traditional hypothesis  testing  is rarely  
utilized.80  Uncertainty  in all ICER estimates  will be quantified using 
non-parametric bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_493505] a 95% confidence  
interval (CI) with Fieller’s method.133,[ADDRESS_635085] utility  values  (preference-based measures of quality of life 
ranging from 0 to 1, defined by [CONTACT_493563]).102  
Sensitivity analyses will calculate QALYs with assigned  values  for 
HADS scores  (1.0 for no, 0.8 for mild,  and 0.6 for severe anxiety or 
depression) as described previously.135-137  The  rationale for this dual 
approach is that preference-based  scoring  in pediatrics has limitations  
because rapid developmental  changes make it difficult to identify 
health attributes  (and hence,  utility  values)  relevant  to all age 
groups.138  
11.4.3 Parent Outcomes. The same analysis as above (primary outcome  and Aim 2A) 
will be undertaken for the parent  outcomes.
11.4.4 Patient  Outcome Trajectories. We will use descriptive statistics  to summarize 
patient-reported outcomes in each  study  arm at enrollment, 3 months and 6 
months. We will plot individual patient  trajectories  across  all time-points for each 
outcome measure and attempt to identify trajectory patterns  (e.g.,  stable vs. 
temporary or sustained  improvement  or deterioration) within study  groups.  We 
will also plot outcome summaries  across time by [CONTACT_493564]-

11.5 Exploratory Analyses
11.5.1 Digitally  (MEMS-cap)  assessed medication adherence rates will be defined  
as [(# events of MEMS cap opening/# events prescribed)]  x 100.  Days  when 
oral GVHD medications were  held by [CONTACT_493565] (captured via medical 
record abstraction) will be removed from the denominator, whereas  “missed 
doses” will be defined as those  where  no cap was opened on a day medication 
was prescribed.   Adherence will be calculated on a monthly basis and 
summarized both monthly,  and as a 3-month average.  
11.5.[ADDRESS_635086] consequence  ratios  (e.g., the cost for each 
unit of improvement in average  HADS scores or adherence) using the same 
costing numerators as above  with the HADS and adherence change as the 
denominator.  These will be included  not as a threshold  for cost-effectiveness, 
but as part of a comprehensive evaluation of both costs  and consequences  of 
the intervention.  
11.5.[ADDRESS_635087] parameters  to total healthcare 
costs, we will analyze disaggregated costs (e.g., formal-,  informal-, and non-
healthcare sector  costs)  from a payer  and societal perspective.78,[ADDRESS_635088] hypothesis  testing including  
chi-square tests for frequency data and Kruskal Wallis for non-parametric 
differences in distribution of responses.  
11.5.4 We will explore the relationship  between  biomedical variables and patient 
reported anxiety  and depression through a combination of paired and 
unpaired t-tests,  chi-squared (or Fisher’s  exact) tests, and linear and logistics  
regression.  DNE will be defined  as the number of days from transplant  to an 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC)  of >500/mm2  for >3 days.  Cumulative 
incidence and severity  of Grade II-IV GVHD  will be defined  by [CONTACT_493566]’s clinical provider.  HRV  will be 
measured in 24-hour increments using  both time and frequency  domain 
parameters as established by [CONTACT_493567]. 
Means and standard deviations will be compared to published  normative data in 
adolescents. CTRA scores  will be divided into two groups (above  and below the 
median). We will perform multivariable analyses,  adjusting  for age, sex, 
diagnosis, disease status  at the time of transplant, conditioning intensity, and,

adherence.  The rationale for these subgroup analyses  is grounded in prior findings 
suggesting symptoms, adherence, and overall well-being  are associated.[ADDRESS_635090] a thorough process  evaluation  that includes:  (a) intervention fidelity; 
and, (b) satisfaction queries. Multiple comparisons are a concern since we are collecting 
multiple measures from patients and are interested in several hypotheses.   We minimize  
this problem by [CONTACT_312424] a limited  number of main hypotheses for each aim.   The 
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure  will be used to control  the False Discovery Rate  criterion  
at α=0.[ADDRESS_635091] for multiple  testing in analyses that are not pre-specified.141  
Likewise, in manuscripts and presentations, we will report the number of tests performed 
and interpret results within this context.  
11.7 Missing  Outcome Data
While our goal will be to minimize missing data, data may still be missing due to 
patients/families skippi[INVESTIGATOR_493506], omissions in medical  records,  lack of 
follow-up, medical  complications, or death.   We will quantify  the amount of missing data, 
evaluate the pattern of missingness, association of participant characteristics with 
missing data, and minimize  bias and increase  efficiency in the associations of interest  by 
[CONTACT_493569].142-144  For example, for 
outcomes where  missing  at random (MAR) is a plausible assumption, we will use 
multiple imputation or inverse probability weighting, depending on the statistical  model  
being considered. For missing not at random  (MNAR) data, we will use sensitivity 
analyses.  In all cases, we will assess the robustness  of estimates  due to assumptions.
12.0 Confidentiality 
12.1 Data Storage. All information  and biospecimens collected for research purposes will be 
coded.  Identifying information (names, addresses and phone numbers) will be used 
initially only to identify  potential patients to approach.   The  only link between  the 
Participant identifiers  and their study  identifier  will be kept on a password protected  
database and in a locked  filing cabinet. There are no patient  identifiers collected and 
retained for research  purposes.  Feasibility  data will represent only frequencies and 
percentages.  
12.2 Patient  Identifiers within stored data.  No participant identifiers will be kept with or 
included in the study data.  All  identifying patient information will be stored  on a secure 
database, or in a locked filing cabinet  with the study team.  This data will be stored and

Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template Version: February  [ADDRESS_635092], in order to ensure data quality. 
12.3 Study-wide data management.  Individual sites will be responsible for original source 
data (surveys, Case Report  Forms) until study  completion.   All such  materials will be 
stored in a locked  file cabinet or other  office  with access  only to study staff.  Blood  
samples sent to UCLA for analysis  will not contain any participant identifying information, 
they will be labeled with study  ID only. When sample  analysis is complete at UCLA, 
results containing study ID only will be faxed or scanned  to the coordinating center for 
electronic storage.  Upon study completion (last data collection for last patient), all 
materials will be coded (labeled  only with study id) and faxed or scanned  to the 
coordinating center  for electronic storage.   
As described  above, monthly site data collection responsibilities will include monitoring 
of local data completeness  and troubleshooting with the coordinating center for data 
completion, if necessary.  Per the Data Transfer Agreement, a Limited Data Set will be 
transmitted by [CONTACT_493570]’s research staff to external collaborators using a secure  
institutionally-approved method. Any data provided  from SCH to [CONTACT_401480] and 
DFCI for oversight purposes  during active data completion will also be deidentified. 
Individual site teams will make all study  files available during the on-site monitoring of 
the study by [CONTACT_165245]. In this instance, PHI will be viewable by [CONTACT_493571][INVESTIGATOR_493507].  
When Zoom is used,  the following actions will be taken  to protect confidentiality  and 
privacy:
1.The latest version of Zoom that is available will be used.
2.The meeting  room will be set to private.
3.A password/passcode will be required for meeting entry.
4.The private chat function  will be disabled.
5.   The General chat function will be used.  Examples of General chat use may include 
sharing approved resources and PRISM app passwords, communicating if there are 
technical difficulties,  and the accommodation  of specific needs  by [CONTACT_3445]’s 
request (e.g. if a patient has a medical reason that may impact verbal 
communication). 
13.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure  the Safety  of Subjects
13.1 Data collection: 
Data collection will occur  at each of the enrolling  study sites: Seattle Cancer Care 
Alliance (Seattle Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493493]), 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7723] (CHLA),  University of Alabama  at Birmingham (UAB) 
and St. Jude  Children’s  Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (SJCRH), with the exception of CTRA gene

electronic medical  record. Protected  health information (PHI) is accessible only by [CONTACT_493572].
13.[ADDRESS_635094]  information,  digital ECG files, blood samples, and 
electronic MEMs cap medicine adherence data. Protected health  information (PHI) is 
accessible only by [CONTACT_493573], and the on-site monitor  from the 
coordinating site (SCH).   A variety  of measures will be utilized to ensure  participant 
privacy. Minimal paper records, such as consent forms, will be kept in a locked drawer  in 
the site PIs’ research  offices. No identifiable patient  information will be labeled on the 
surveys, blood samples, or ECG  files; all will be identified with a study-specific identifier 
with assigned identifier kept on a password protected encrypted server.  Data  will be 
stored in an electronic database (REDCap -Research Electronic Data Capture) using the 
participant’s study identifier. REDCap data collection projects  rely on a thorough study-
specific data dictionary defined as an iterative  self-documenting process  by [CONTACT_493574]. We have conducted the iterative development and testing process 
previously, resulting in well-planned  data collection.  REDCap servers  are housed in a 
data center  and all web-based information  transmission is encrypted.  For the present 
study, we will use the REDCap system managed by [CONTACT_493575] (ITHS).  REDCap was developed specifically 
around HIPAA-Security  guidelines and is recommended to researchers at various 
institutions by [CONTACT_493576]. REDCap has been 
disseminated for use locally and at other  institutions and currently  supports  over 300 
academic/non-profit consortium partners on six continents and over 20,000 research 
end-users (www.project-redcap.org). The REDCap  data record may contain some  
identifying information.  Subjects will be tracked using their study identifier. The 
identifiable data will be designated as “PHI” in the REDCap database which  will allow us 
to exclude access  to the identifiable information  as necessary.
13.3 Survey  data
The study questionnaire (“Resilience in Pediatric Cancer Assessment”, RPCA) and the 
intervention (“Promoting  Resilience in Stress  Management”, PRISM) may address 
sensitive matters. Participants may be prompted  to think about  the threat to their life 
posed by [CONTACT_493577], as well as other  difficult  topi[INVESTIGATOR_493508], 
grief, bereavement, and health behaviors.  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_493509], anxiety,  depression,  fear or doubt.  
While surveys will be coded to protect anonymity and do not include instruments to 
directly measure suicidal  ideation or other  self-harming behaviors , they will be reviewed  
within 72 hours for (a) missingness (see 13.4.1  below); and (b) unanticipated immediate 
threats to participants’ or others’ safety. 
Site Principal Researcher: Mallory Taylor, MD, MS
Protocol  Version  Number:  17

Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template Version: February  [ADDRESS_635095] that confidentiality may be broken in the case that 
providers see an immediate threat to the patient’s or another’s safety. No physical risks 
are expected to arise  from the study.
If indicated, referral for consultation  will include a direct phone  call (or in-person 
consultation) by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_493510]. This would 
include alerting:  a) current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (if they have one), and b) their oncology  social  
worker. The participant  will also be given the phone number to the site’s outpatient 
psychiatric clinic,  and county-specific crisis line phone numbers will also be provided  as 
needed. 
In the event of other concerns from interventionists and/or other  study staff based on 
interactions with AYAs  and families, as well as in other cases of concern for patient  or 
others’ safety, the same processes will occur, including immediate referrals  to the site 
PI, and the patients’ primary medical  and social work teams for in-person evaluation or 
referral to the appropriate mental health professional  if warranted. After hours, the site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_225671]-call providers from the medical teams will be notified.  All study-related  concerns 
for patient or other person’s safety will be reported  as an adverse event (AE) to the IRB 
and Data Safety Monitoring  Committee (DSMC,  see “Data  Safety  Monitoring  Plan”),  
within [ADDRESS_635096]  once  monthly with study staff from all participating sites.  
While this is not a pharmacologic  trial and we do not anticipate  medical  complications,  
sites will nevertheless notify the IRB and DSMC of all participant deaths at the time of 
study renewal (annually).   Unanticipated (non-medical) participant deaths will be 
reported to the DSMC  within 1 week with a determination if the event might be 
attributable to the study.  In such cases, the DSMC chair may convene  the committee  
and/or suspend the study for additional review (see section 13.5 below).  
13.4 MEMs Cap Medicine  Adherence Data
The coordinating center will be responsible for uploading  and maintaining the MEMS cap 
medicine adherence  data.   After each patient returns  their MEMS cap following their 
study completions, the study coordinator will mail the track  caps  in padded envelope to 
the coordinating center -  Seattle Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493511]: Molly Taylor ([ADDRESS_635097]. 
M/S CURE-4,  Seattle,  WA [ZIP_CODE]). The site coordinator will upload the data will be via 
the MEMS MAP modem (Aardex Group, Belgium),  yielding a record of times and dates 
that the container was opened.  These methods have been  used successfully in prior 
pediatric and AYA adherence studies.97,145,[ADDRESS_635098] the Actiheart monitor  
from the patient (either in clinic or while  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  De-identified data from the 
device will be uploaded into the Actiheart software (CamnTech, Inc), which will be 
installed on one computer  located  in the locked office of the study PI.  Data  will then be 
transferred to the abovementioned encrypted RedCap  database.

5 mL whole blood will be collected  in a PaxGene (PreAnalytiX GmbH) blood tube at the 
time of a planned  clinical blood draw. These biospecimens will be labeled  with the 
subject’s study  ID only (no identifying information) and sent to the Seattle Children’s 
Research Lab Services (RLS) Core (Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Seattle, WA) for 
storage. De-identified,  batched blood  samples  will be shipped by [CONTACT_493578] (UCLA) Social  Genomics  Core Laboratory for analysis.
13.7 Data Collection Procedures/ Internal  Site Monitoring plan:
The coordinating center will be responsible for systematic data collection, quality control, 
and data-management procedures including:  (1) oversight of ongoing  data collection;  (2) 
rigorous training and ongoing  monitoring of adherence to protocols; (3) regular review  of 
questionnaire response  rates and missing  items  to identify  and correct  problems; (4) 
verification of all data through computerized data entry systems restricting invalid/out-of-
range responses;  (5) at minimum monthly  meetings and progress  reports  to provide 
feedback to study staff concerning difficulties and follow-up to ensure problems are 
resolved quickly, and (6) yearly on-site  monitoring of participating sites.   
13.7.1 Survey  data: 
To optimize collection, all participant  surveys will be available  by [CONTACT_493579], a secure HIPAA-compliant, high-quality  data collection 
tool. The rationale for offering both paper-pencil and electronic versions is based 
on our prior experience where  participants  preferred  the former,[ADDRESS_635099] to drop out.  To ensure data quality, a 
RA will review  RPCA  surveys  within 72 hours of their completion  for missing 
fields and call participants to clarify  and query/complete individual  missing  items 
verbally.  
13.7.2 MEMS caps: 
One to two weeks following discharge  from the initial HCT and the day after any 
subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  an RA will contact  [CONTACT_493580]-cap system and, where relevant, confirm  the MEMS-cap is being used.   
Where indicated,  to identify obstacles  and solutions to its use. 
13.7.[ADDRESS_635100] data:  
RA’s will collect and upload CRF data monthly.  To  ensure  reliability and validity  
of abstracted  medical record data, we will use our current  methods  for training 
and quality control, including guided practice abstraction  and independent 
abstraction with reconciliation by a trainer.  A  10% random sample will be dual 
abstracted.  A RA assignment will monitor and reconcile case  report  forms with 
RedCap data once  monthly.
13.7.4 Heart Rate  Variability  monitors:

Staff investigators and RA’s  will be trained on recognizing  adequate  signal 
acquisition on the Actiheart monitors when the patient  initially  has the device 
placed.  If there is suboptimal recording identified, the team member placing the 
device will be able to recognize  in real time and make appropriate adjustments to 
the equipment  based on Actiheart user manual  suggestions.
13.7.5  Blood Samples:  
Following quality assurance  testing of suitable mass (Nanodrop ND1000) and 
integrity (Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA Integrity  Score), mRNA  will be converted to 
cDNA (Illumina TruSeq), and >10 million sequence reads  will be obtained on an 
Illumina HiSeq  4000 instrument in the UCLA Neuroscience Genomics  Core.  
Reads will be mapped to the RefSeq human genome (hisat2/stringtie) to 
estimate gene  transcript abundance  counts  per million mapped  reads.
13.8 Safety and Compliance  Monitoring
This is a small multisite  clinical  trial of a supportive  care intervention  that presents no 
more than minimal risk. As such, data monitoring will be primarily carried  out by [CONTACT_493581] (SCH) and a small,  external Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC).  
13.8.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
Safety monitoring will be the responsibility  of a 4-member  Data  Safety and 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) composed  of professionals  across  the country 
representing different  disciplines and expertise (see table below). All members are 
independent of the protocol.  The committee will be convened at the beginning of 
the study and then twice annually via conference calls, to provide input and 
guidance on the study evaluation and intervention protocols, including quality  
assurance and safety issues  related to the protocols, as well as data handling 
activities. As above, in the event of an unanticipated patient death,  the committee 
may convene an ad-hoc  session and/or suspend the study to assess  patient risk 
and/or necessary revisions to the protocol.

13.8.3 Monitoring  study safety.  
DSMC members  will provide  input and feedback to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-investigators, 
via e-mail and conference calls, related to (a) accrual rate, (b) study eligibility 
determination issues, (c) data completion rates including conformance with 
informed consent  requirements, (d) intervention fidelity indicators,  (e) adverse 
events, and (f) compliance  with data management  procedures. The lead 
statistician will oversee  the summarization  of online  data to evaluate data 
completeness and protocol adherence. The Lead  CRA will also send monthly  
reports summarizing recruitment and other site specific  data (such  as indicators 
of intervention delivery, occurrence of adverse events, and conformance  with 
IRB requirements). 
The committee will also receive information  on questionnaire data, presented  for 
the participants overall rather than by [CONTACT_2060].  This study will not have pre-
set stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], but the DSMC will have the option of requesting  the data be 
un-blinded and considering altering the study or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_493512].  
Although the full committee will meet twice-yearly, the chair will be free to 
assemble the full committee  at any time if the chair believes it is important. 
Because committee members may be located  at various sites,  the committee  
meetings may be conducted by [CONTACT_648]. 
Data safety monitoring for the intervention  will focus  on assuring that subjects 
are not experiencing any significant or unexpected distress  and that they are 
satisfied with the intervention components; we will monitor all complaints about 
the study.  We do not anticipate stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_493513],  
but the DSMC will have  the option to consider such action in the event of a 
highly unexpected result. The DSMC will review the draft questionnaires to be 
sent to subjects and review any complaints  that may be received from patients,  
family members, clinicians, or others.   We do not anticipate any external  factors  
such as findings  from ongoing trials that will affect  the safety of participants or 
the ethics of this research study.
13.8.[ADDRESS_635101] information on all potential  types of 
adverse events. Consistent with NIH, and the sites IRBs policies, adverse 
events will be promptly reported in writing  to the NIH, individual IRBs, and the 
DSMC chair.  The DSMC will modify or stop the study if any such complaints  
represent a legitimate concern about the study  procedures or methods.  
13.8.5 Compliance with monitoring requirements.

Compliance with the monitoring  plan will be ensured through the Lead RA’s 
close supervision. The Lead RA will hold no less than monthly calls with the 
sites to monitor recruitment and protocol adherence. Site RAs will gather 
required information on an ongoing basis and send monthly written reports to 
Lead RA. The Lead RA will schedule yearly on-site  monitoring visits as the

14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects
14.1 Plan for Non-Responders
Response to the intervention will be determined upon study completion (not in “real-
time,”).  All participants, including those on the intervention arm, will continue  to receive 
usual care, including as-needed referrals  for professional psychology services.  
14.[ADDRESS_635103] a brief reason to be recorded for tracking purposes.   In the 
event of serious medical complications (or death) precluding participation,  participants 
will be censored after 2 months of missing data.  In all other cases  (non-completion of 
surveys without serious medical  complications or death), staff will continue  to request 
surveys until [ADDRESS_635104]
In this intention-to-treat analysis plan, all participants who fill out a baseline  survey will 
be included  in analyses.  As  above, withdrawal will be determined  by [CONTACT_493582].   
14.4 Data Collection  and Follow-up  for Withdrawn Subjects 
Unless explicitly indicated by [CONTACT_493583], baseline data for

The intervention (“Promoting Resilience in Stress  Management”, PRISM) and our surveys  may 
address sensitive matters  in that it they patients  to identify stressors and negative thoughts.  
Adolescent and young adult participants may be prompted to think about the threat  to their life 
posed by [CONTACT_493577], as well as other  difficult  topi[INVESTIGATOR_493516], sexuality and 
substance abuse.  During  the coming together session and/or while completing surveys,  
parent(s)/caregiver(s)/spouse/significant other may be prompted to think  about  the threat to their

other.  Administrators of the intervention  will be trained to inform the patient’s primary social 
work and/or medical teams if the patient  and/or parents/guardians/spouses/significant  others 
endorses thoughts  of self-harm or harm to others. As part of their informed  consent  process,  
participants will be made aware of this policy, as well as the fact that confidentiality may be 
broken in the case that providers see an immediate threat to the patient’s or another’s  safety.   
Patients who participate in the optional HRV measurement component  of the study may 
experience some mild physical discomfort or skin irritation associated  with wearing the ECG 
monitor.  The risk is minimal, as this process  is identical  to standard ECG  measurements 
obtained for clinical purposes, of which all participants will have undergone.  Minimal physical 
risks are expected to arise from the study, primarily related to the optional  blood sample  
component. All patients undergoing HCT will have  a central line, and blood samples will be 
drawn from the central line as the default; peripheral IV blood draws will only be performed if the 
patient does not have  a functional central  line. There would not be an additional “poke” to draw 
research blood  from a participant. Risks associated with blood draw include slightly  prolonging 
the length of another  planned blood draw,  and rarely fainting  or infection. The research blood  
samples will be drawn at the same  time of clinical indicated  blood draws so that these risks are 
not increased.  Blood draws will be performed  by [CONTACT_493584], and the 
challenges of drawing blood  from this population.
The particular type of genetic testing  to be performed using the blood  samples  will not pose any 
additional risks to subjects. The CTRA analysis is not a traditional  genetic test (it does not test 
for the presence  or absence of certain genes or mutations that might confer any kind of risk to 
the patient).   It is testing  how “turned on” or “turned off” certain  ubiquitous genes are in a 
particular subject, but does not provide information  on the subject’s underlying  DNA makeup.  
The results  of this analysis will not have any bearing  on a participant’s genetic risk factors for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_493518].
The primary risk to participants will be concerns  about confidentiality,  and stress of discussing 
the topic of their or their child’s/significant  other’s cancer experience.  While the potential  risks to 
participants are low, we will take steps  to ensure that all potential risks are handled 
appropriately as described below.
Due to the nature of the PRISM intervention, all staff and participants will be unblinded from the 
time of randomization. 
We recognize the unique risks of data collection for an AYA population. The major  risk is 
compromise of personal data. Thus, confidentiality  procedures for all data will be a priority for

distress and greater quality of life.  We also hypothesize that parents/caregivers/significant 
others/spouses  will benefit similarly from their child’s/partner’s  participation  because  prior 
experience in pediatric cancer studies  suggests it is personally important for some  patients and 
caregivers to share their perspectives, challenges  and growth experienced during their cancer.   
However, there may be no direct benefit for participating in this study  if our hypotheses are 
wrong.   More broadly,  information gained from this study may heighten the understanding  of 
the AYA cancer experience and elucidate strategies that foster  resilience and promote better 
quality of life in this group of high risk patients.  These  strategies  could  be extended to the care 
of other  AYA patients facing  non-cancer-related life-threatening illness.  This research has the 
potential to contribute to the research  base concerning the promotion  of optimal quality of life 
and mental wellness for all AYA patients.    
17.0 Vulnerable Populations
17.1 This Study  includes the following vulnerable  populations:
17.1.1 Individuals  who are not yet adults (children, teenagers): Pediatric  patients  with 
serious illness are at risk for poor outcomes and may benefit from resilience-
enhancing interventions  in the future. We justify the inclusion of children in this 
project because the implementation  of those interventions  requires feasibility 
information and patient feedback. This study will provide those crucial data.  
Patients enrolling in this study may, in fact, benefit from the intervention;  
however, at the time of consent, we will ensure that all patients and families  
understand the objective of this study  are to test the feasibility of this intervention  
such that it may be used prospectively in the future (see risks/benefits above). 
17.1.2 Pregnant women:  There is a chance  that a parent/caregiver/spouse/significant 
other of a patient participant is pregnant and therefore could participate in the 
survey and/or ‘coming together’ portion of this study.   This study does not involve

inclusion/exclusion criteria  of being physically or cognitively able to participate in in depth  
interviews, or because  they are anticipated to have  inconsistent  presence at the 
bedside, suggesting inconsistent participation in said interviews.

1.6.1 Following  completion of the study,  a written summary of the main results will be provided 
to all interested participants.
There are no plans  to return results from the CTRA genetic analysis to participants, as 
this does not relate to their underlying genetic  makeup  or hereditary risk for disease.
20.0 Setting
1.6.1 Patients  will be identified and recruited at either at SCCA or at SCH. See section  23 for 
specifics. 
1.6.2 Study visits may be done  in person at SCH  in the inpatient room or in the outpatient  
clinical research center or at SCCA on the 6th floor pediatric  transplant  clinic, or via 
phone or other web based communication (i.e., zoom,  WebEx,  skype, blue jeans, go to 
meetings, WhatsApp, etc.).

RNA sequencing  and report  results  back to the coordinating institution.
22.0 Prior Approvals
NIH NCI/R01 CA225629-01 was reviewed by [CONTACT_493586]. 
23.0 Participant Incentives
All active patient participants will receive  three  installment  payments  in the form of a $[ADDRESS_635109] during  the 6-month duration  of the study. Patients will be paid one installment of $25 for 
each RPCA survey (baseline, 3-months,  and 6-months), for a total of up to $75 for participation.
Throughout their participation on the study,  AYA participants will receive small, non-monetary 
items (i.e., a pen, lanyard,  tote bag, etc.). Parent/guardian participants will also be offered non-
monetary items (PRISM paraphernalia  such as pens, bags, stress balls,  mugs,  etc.) but no gift-
cards. AYA participants  who complete both the baseline and 6-month surveys will also be 
entered in a raffle to win an iPad. At each site, raffles  will take place after [ADDRESS_635110] 10% chance of

The study team will use a private room to discuss potential participation  and the use of an 
intermediary (as needed)  if the subject does  not know the researcher. Emphasis will be made to 
ensure that subjects  know that not participating  will not impact patient care.
The study team will warn the participant of the possibility of sensitive subject matter before  the 
session. The study team will be sure to emphasize to the participant that this study is completely 
optional and the participant  has the right to not answer any questions  that they feel 
uncomfortable with, that they can withdraw their participation at any time, and that their refusal  
to participate in this research will not impact  their care.
The study team will have access to any patient/participant  information  that could pertain to study  
participation or that has an influence on how a participant participates.
When possible, texting  participants will occur on a secure, HIPAA-compliant platform. If a 
HIPAA-compliant platform is not available or allowable per specific site restrictions,  research 
staff will not include PHI in texting communications with participants and families.  Depending on 
the texting platform  used, subjects may be able to send text messages back  to the study team.  
Any texting platform used  (depending on local site requirements)  that allows research staff to 
receive text messages from subjects wsill be HIPAA compliant and will protect  all information  
received from subjects.  
27.0 Compensation for Research-Related Injury
There is no compensation for research-related injury.
28.0 Economic Burden to Subjects
We strive  to complete these visits with patients while they are already at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. As above,  
if explicitly requested, intervention sessions may be conducted via phone  or other web-based  
communication (e.g., zoom, WebEx, skype, blue jeans,  go to meetings,  WhatsApp, etc.)  or via 
phone.  
Patients and families  will be asked if they would like to receive  text messages from the study  
team for study participation coordination (e.g., enrollment, survey reminders, intervention 
session scheduling,  payment). Standard text messaging rates  from mobile phone providers may 
be incurred. The study team will inform patients  and families of potential  charges in the consent 
conference and give them an opportunity to opt out to avoid potential charges.
No additional  study visits will be scheduled for study conduction purposes alone (all visits will be 
conducted in conjunction with other medical  visits).  It  should be noted,  however, that one of our 
objectives is to determine economic burdens associated  with the intervention  and study 
participation.

29.2 Consent Conferences. The consent meeting between the CRA and eligible participants 
(with parents  if applicable) will include an explanation of the study in developmentally 
appropriate lay-language.  All AYA participants will provide either  written  informed 
consent (if aged 18 years  or more  (or assent (if <18 years-old).  Parents of teens (<18 
years-old) will provide written informed consent. For patients/families  who are screened 
and provide verbal interest  by [CONTACT_648], the written  consent  form may be mailed for receipt 
and review prior to enrollment.  As described  in the inclusion/exclusion  criteria above 
(Section 3), participants must  speak English fluently;  however, they are eligible  if English 
is not their primary language spoken  at home (or if it is not their first language). In cases  
where parent consent is required and parents do not speak English fluently (or prefer 
another language), all conferences will be held in the presence  of a trained  medical  
interpreter either in person or via phone  interpreter.  All participants  and parents will be 
provided an opportunity  to read the consent/assent  form in their preferred language 
(English or Spanish), to ask questions about the study and have those questions 
answered by [CONTACT_493587]/assent form.   Parental permission for study participation will be 
obtained first then patient assent  will be obtained for all patients 12-17 years  of age.  If a 
patient indicates that they do not want  to participate  in the study that non-assent will 
override the parent’s  permission  and the patient will be recorded as a refusal.  The  
research team member will redirect any parent  who attempts to convince  their child to 
participate in the study and remind them of their child’s  right as a potential  research 
participant to refuse participation  without coercion.  Consent to study participation will be 
obtained from patients [ADDRESS_635113] how their nurses or doctors care for them. 
When the consent conference is conducted via phone/video,  those who agree to 
participate will complete an electronic consent form via the REDCap database using  the 
REDCap e-consent framework. Study staff may also email  or mail a copy of the consent 
form to subjects if requested. The body of the consent form will be identical, whether on 
paper or in REDCap.  A link to the consent form will be e-mailed to participants prior to 
the phone/video consent conference. Study staff will answer  any questions about  the 
study, and those who agree to participate  will provide an electronic signature, date,  and 
time on the REDCap  form to indicate their consent.  The REDCap e-consent framework 
allows participants to create  an electronic signature  [CONTACT_493597] a 
timestamp. This framework also automatically generates an extra certification page for 
participants to confirm the correctness of their responses before  submitting and stores  a 
static copy of their responses as a PDF in the study’s file repository.  Subjects will also

be prompted to download a copy of their signed consent form from REDCap or study 
staff can e-mail the signed form if requested. After the participant has completed  the e-
consent form, the RA will immediately complete a corresponding  REDCap form that 
includes: a) the names of the patient  and parent (if applicable); b) the name  [CONTACT_493598];  an attestation  that the subject  agreed to participate,  that all 
risks and opportunities of the study  were explained,  and that the subject had adequate 
opportunity to have  their questions answered; and c) the RAs electronic  signature [CONTACT_493599]/time. If an interpreter is used, the name [CONTACT_493600].
For eligible patients who are visually impaired, the font size on consent forms and other 
documents will be enlarged according  to patient preferences. If eligible patients with 
visual impairment cannot read large print text, the consent materials  will be explained to 
the subject in the presence of an impartial witness who observes the entire consent 
process. In that case, sufficient time will be allowed for questions  to be asked and 
answered, to ensure  that the subject comprehends the consent information. The 
presence of the witness will be documented in the chart note and on the consent form.
If participants request  for a PDF of the consent forms to be emailed, participants may 
print/sign/scan the form and return to the RA; if mailed, a return envelope  will be 
enclosed so participants can sign and return the form. Once forms are received, the RA 
will sign and date, as well as note the date which the phone consent conference took 
place. 
In all cases, RAs will create a consent  process  note for the EMR. Included in this note 
will be the date of the consent  conference, the names of the patient  and parent (if 
applicable), the name [CONTACT_493601], the fact that the subject agreed to 
participate and that all risks and opportunities of the study were explained, and that the 
subject had adequate opportunity to have their questions  answered. If an interpreter is 
used, the name [CONTACT_493602].
A separate  consent will be obtained from parents/guardians who choose to participate in 
the parent  portion of the study,  meaning they will be completing their own study 
questionnaires and will be disclosing their own financial and quality of life information in 
surveys. In addition, parents/caregivers/spouse/significant other  may provide  an 
addendum to the AYA consent/assent to acknowledge that they may participate in the 
‘Coming Together’ portion of the study. Parents/guardians  may elect  to participate  in 
either or both of these study components  (i.e., still be involved in the ‘Coming Together’ 
portion of the study and not want to complete questionnaires and visa versa). If 
requested by [CONTACT_493588], other individuals (i.e., other parents/caregivers/spouse/significant 
other) will also provide an addendum to the AYA consent/assent if they may participate 
in the ‘Coming  Together’ portion of the study. There will be a separate addendum to the 
consent form for the optional HRV  and blood sample  (CTRA)  measurement  components 
of the study.  Parent  consents and both consent addendums will be presented to families  
following either the in-person or e-consent methods  described above.

eligible to participate.  Procedures for screening,  approach,  and enrollment of 
these families  will be similar to above, except as follows:
29.2.2 For Spanish  Speaking Parents:
For patients < 18 years-old: Spanish-English translations of the consent  and 
assent forms will be provided  for parents during discussions of the study and 
consent conferences and all discussions will occur with trained  medical  
interpreters.  
29.2.3 For patients  18 years and older: 
Spanish-English translations of the consent  will be provided for parents  during  
discussions of the study and consent conferences  at patients’ requests.  
Likewise, if patients wish their parents/caregiver/spouse/significant other to 
participate in session 5, “coming together,”  parents will be invited to sign a 
Spanish version of the consent.   All discussions involving  Spanish (non-English)  
speaking parents will occur with trained medical interpreters.  
29.2.4 For all patients:  
Session 5 (“coming together”) will be offered in the presence  of a Spanish 
interpreter.  All other 1:1 sessions  will still be conducted in English with English-
speaking, trained interventionists.  
29.2.5 For Other Non-English  Speaking  Parents,  on a case-by-case basis:
Discussions of study will occur  with interpreters in the appropriate  language.   If 
families and patients are interested in participation, informed consent forms 
would be translated into the native language of the parent.
Everything pertaining to Spanish  speaking parents would be the same for other  
non-English speaking parents  except  that discussions, conferences, and Session 
5 would be in the native language of the parent. 
29.3 If patient is still actively on study, however, patient is no longer coming to clinic on a 
regular basis and turns 18 years  old or needs to re-consent due to a modification with 
the protocol (or other cause), study staff will email/mail the consent  to the participant and 
will call the participant (and parents if applicable) and go over study changes.   If emailed, 
participants may e-sign the consent form via REDCap. If mailed, the mailing  will include 
a pre-paid return mailing envelope  so the participant can sign and return  to return  to 
study staff. The study staff will make note of the date of the re-consent conference.  
When the participant/parent-signed  form is returned the researcher will then sign and 
date it with the current date.  He/she will add a notation  that the actual consent  
conference took place on the date noted  via telephone.  Similarly, if participants move  
away from a study  center, staff will query their continued  interest in study participation

and offer all study  activities remotely via phone or other web-based communication (i.e., 
zoom, WebEx, skype, blue jeans, go to meetings, WhatsApp, etc.) to encourage 
continued participation. Additionally, staff will ask that participants provide  a contact

Release of Information  for us to contact [CONTACT_493590].  
29.4 Waiver of HIPAA for Recruitment and Alteration of HIPAA 
29.4.1 Provide protocol specific findings justifying  this determination: The waiver  of HIPAA  
Authorization is being requested for preliminary screening  purposes.. Preliminary  
screening procedures  are minimal risk; they include a basic review of the patient’s 
medical records to identify whether or not the patient  meet basic  eligibility  
requirements. In addition, we are requesting  an alteration for cases in which it is 
necessary to conduct consent remotely (via phone or video-conference) because  
we cannot approach eligible  patients  in-person due to patient safety concerns (e.g.,  
during COVID-19 pandemic). Many  of our participants are immunocompromised, 
and there will be many  cases unrelated  to or after the COVID-19  pandemic in 
which it would be much  safer  to approach  patients remotely  (e.g. when staff are ill, 
when participants are receiving immunosuppressing  treatment, when participants 
are very ill). In these cases,  we will follow remote consent procedures outlined  
above, and patients/parents  will indicate  their willingness to participate  both 
verbally and via digital signature [CONTACT_493603]. In-person approaches and 
consent conferences will be prioritized when they are possible, and in those  cases  
written signatures  will be obtained.  Research coordinators  will collaborate with the 
site PIs to regarding  instances  when remote consenting is necessary. Site PIs will 
make the final determination  as to when remote consenting is appropriate.     
29.4.2 The research could NOT  practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration. 
Provide protocol specific findings justifying  this determination:  We need to have 
the waiver of HIPAA for screening  in order to determine potentially eligible 
participants for this study.  If we did not confirm  eligibility with the clinicians giving 
care, confirmation of eligibility would be dependent upon the patient and parents.  It 
is likely  that they would be able to confirm  the eligibility  criteria but there is the 
possibility that some may not be able to do so for all of the study criteria. It is also 
possible that they may be uncomfortable being asked  to confirm the eligibility  
criteria or wonder why it is that they are being asked to do so. We need this 
alteration to be able to consent  participants in cases where  in-person consent  
conferences may pose  risk to the patients, particularly within  this 
immunosuppressed, high-risk population.  The bone marrow  transplant patients we 
are attempting to enroll are highly immunocompromised, with a much  higher risk 
for infection by a multitude of transmissible illnesses, and these patients are 
susceptible to substantially worse symptoms and outcomes from such illnesses

consent conferences  in person; therefore,  without this alteration enrollment in this 
study is not feasible for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the COVID-[ADDRESS_635117] patient safety while  still giving all eligible patients 
the opportunity  to participate in this potentially beneficial  research, we need the 
option to enroll  patients remotely. In this case,  it is currently unclear when this 
pandemic will truly end and could take years for an acceptable measure of safety  
to be restored to our community; furthermore, even  once  the COVID-19 pandemic 
has resolved there are other  potential  circumstances that could similarly mitigate 
our ability to approach  in-person (e.g., a bad flu season). Thus, this alteration is 
crucial to protect the health of potential  research participants while still furthering 
this important research.
 In addition, both of our previous procedures for remote  consent conferences  are 
no longer feasible in this circumstance, as follows: 1) When a remote  consent 
conference was requested by [CONTACT_493591],  we had previously mailed 
consent forms prior to a phone consent conference and requested that families 
sign the forms and return via mail. However, during this unique  time, families of 
individuals in our target  population are likely exercising extreme caution to protect 
their at-risk  child’s  health,  meaning  many  may prefer to avoid sharing of physical 
documents via mail. Furthermore,  requiring  families  to return  documents  via mail 
may pose  additional risk and burden as they will need to leave their homes  to 
locate mailboxes or visit the post office. 2) We had also previously e-mailed 
consent forms to families and requested that they print,  sign, scan and return  to us 
via email. However, we have found that this option  is very often not doable  for 
families in this population  as it requires them to have access to a printer  and 
scanner, which  the majority do not (e.g.,  families  not living at home, when the AYA 
in inpatient, etc.) Therefore,  in order to continue to recruit for this study whilst 
ensuring patient safety and minimizing any burden  or stress on families,  providing 
an electronic means for families to review consent forms and indicate willingness to 
participate (via digital  signature) is necessary. 
29.4.3 Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent  
information after participation. Provide protocol  specific findings justifying this 
determination: Study participants  will be provided with any additional information 
that may become known during the course  of the study which may influence their 
decision to be in the study.
29.4.4  Waivers  for participants who turn 18: 
We will re-approach and consent participants if they turn [ADDRESS_635118] the waiver of consent for 
patients that turn 18 if no further  data collection and study related activities are 
occurring, as their data is limited to the continued  use of existing  data.

29.5 Subjects who are not yet adults  (infants, children,  teenagers)
Consent/assent will be obtained for all patients 12 years-old and older (written assent for 
those ages 12-17, and written consent  for those 18 years and older).   These  consent  
conferences will be documented in the patient’s medical record.  If a patient indicates that 
he or she does not want to participate in the study, that non-assent will override the 
parent’s permission and the parent will be recorded  as a refusal.  The  research team 
member will redirect  any parent  who attempts  to convince their child to participate in the 
study and remind  them of their child’s right as a potential research participant  to refuse 
participation without coercion.  The CRA  or PI [INVESTIGATOR_493520]-language that being in the study is their choice, that they 
may choose not to participate or may change their mind at any time and it will not affect  
how their nurses or doctors care for them.
Since this is a minimal risk studies, consent  will be obtained by [CONTACT_493592], known, competent, reasonably available,  and shares  legal

PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
 
HIV has transformed into a chronic illness du e to the advent of effective treatments  in the absence of a cure . 
As a result, the prevalence of non -AIDS  defin ing cancers (NADC s), including lung cancer, has increased three -
fold among people living with HIV . NADC s now account for 50% of all can cers among the people . Smoking is 
one of the major contributing factors  to lung cancer and smoking prevalence is  substantially higher in this 
population than the general U.S. population . Smoking prevalence does not differ by [CONTACT_347127]. Women of color, parti cularly African American women  represent the majority of women living 
with HIV (WLHIV) followed by [CONTACT_347128] . WLHIV smoke at a rate almost 3 times higher than that for the general 
U.S. female population (e.g., 42% vs. 16%). The pro posed study has two phases: 1) the development of a 
storytelling narrative  communication (SNC) intervention that will be added to an established HIV -tailored 
smoking cessation intervention and 2) a two -arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the HIV -tailored 
intervention plus the SNC Intervention compared with the HIV -tailored intervention only. We will develop 
narrative videos with three to five WLHIV who will be talking about t heir personal struggles with smoking and 
success in quitting.  Our preliminary study revealed that the established HIV -tailored intervention was effective 
only for short -term (≤ 2 months) abstinence. Many relapsed to smoking between the 2nd and 6th month of 
quitting. We propose that the SNC intervention will be an effective strategy to sustain their quit efforts for long -
term abstinence (≥ 6 months).  A total of 60  WLHIV will be recruited  and randomly assigned to either the 
experimental arm (a combination of HIV -tailored and SNC interventions) or the control arm (HIV -tailored 
intervent ion only) . 
 
STUDY AIMS  
The Purposes of the study are to 1)  Identify  SNC intervention components that are rated high in transport and 
identification for use as an enhancement to an HIV -tailored smoking cessation intervention; 2)  Determine the 
feasibility and acceptability of the SNC intervention for WLHIV by [CONTACT_347129]; and 3) Establish an effect 
size of HIV -tailor ed and SNC interventions  for smoking cessation  in comparison with the HIV -tailored smoking 
cessation intervention only for WLHIV , for subsequent grant applications.   
 
 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  
People living with HIV now live longer because of the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy.1-3 However, the 
burden of non -AIDS related , especially, non-AIDS defining cancers (NADC s) has increased considerably and 
smoking is a  profound cause of NADC s.3-6 These cancers  now account for 50% of all cancers among t hose 
with HIV, with lung cancer being the mo st common and deadliest cancer .6-People living with HIV smoke 
cigarettes at much higher rates than the general U.S. population i.e., 40 -80% versus 19%.1,7-9 There is no 
gender difference in smoking prevalence amo ng people living with HIV . Women living with HIV (WLHIV) smoke 
at a rate almost three times higher than that for the general U.S. female population.[ADDRESS_431328] cancers at each stage of  diagnosis.11 The majority of participants in smoking

cessation studies for people living with HIV were males (> 80%) and studies conducted with WLHIV are v ery 
scarce.[ADDRESS_431329] of  storytelling narrative communication (SNC)  on an individual is largely determined by [CONTACT_347130], the perceived sensitivities to the risks and benefits that the stories effectively convey, identification 
with the storytellers, and the transformatio n of the individual from identification within the narrative.16-22This 
SNC intervention will relate one’s personal story, which has culturally sensitive and gender -specific narratives 
to WLHIV for strong identification. The effect of the intervention is to  increase emotional engagement and to 
break down cognitive resistance through absorption in the storyline and identification w ith characters in the 
narrative.16-[ADDRESS_431330] them.  
Storytelling, as a mode of narrative communication, is deeply rooted in A frican and Latino cultures and has 
been used to transmit ideas in educ ation and history.23-29  Recent studies indicate that narrative intervention is 
an effective, sustainable approach for changing health behavior, including medication adherence and cancer 
screening.23-29  
 
Video call counseling has the advantage of “eye con tact” tha t promotes therapeutic alliance wh ile avoiding  
transportation hassles among WLHIV . Especially, t hose  who live in a resource -limited area can have virtual 
face-to-face counseling of an HIV -tailored smoking cessation intervention . Video call  also enables researchers  
to monitor adherence to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) during the session and validate self -reported 
abstinence by  [CONTACT_14664] a real -time saliva cotinine test. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_347119] , video call smoking 
cessation interventio ns are very scarce.  Contrary to the belief that individuals from low socio -economic class es 
and ethnic/racial minorities are less likely to use electronic devices  such as computer s and mobile phones, 
recent data suggest that individuals from these backgrounds  have high rates of mobile phone and text 
messaging usage .30,31 In our currently ongoing study with WLHIV, more than 80% of callers owned a 
smartphone.  The proposed study is the  first attempt to test the combined effect of video call counseling and the 
SNC intervention for smoking cessation in WLHIV.  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
     
Research Design:  The proposed study has two phases.  
a. Phase 1. Development of Narrative Video: We will  first 
develop narrative videos in collaboration with 
community organization s of WLHIV in [LOCATION_011]. The 
video will be filmed in person at the University of 
[LOCATION_005] [LOCATION_011].  
b. Phase 2. A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of a 
Story Telling Narrative Communication Intervention:  
We will conduct a  two-arm RCT assigning participants  
at a ratio of 1:1 to either one of the two arms 
(Experimental:  HIV-tailored plus SNC interventions 
vs. Control:  HIV-tailored plus attention -control 
interventions ). Both arms will have eight weekly 
sessions of a 30 -minute HIV -tailored cessation 
interventio n (cognitive behavioral therapy plus nicotine 
patches). The experimental arm will receive three 5 -
minute SNC videos  (testimonial stories about 
successful quitting) , each per month between the first 
and third month of quitting , whereas  the control arm recei ve three  5-minute attention  control  videos  
(women  talking about being diagnos ed with HIV ) at the same monthly interval . However, participants in 
the control arm will also receive the SNC videos talking about successful stories of smoking cessation 
right after the last follow -up assessment ([ADDRESS_431331] -quit). The overall flow of  the study is 
illustrated  in Figure 1. All research -related procedures will be conducted remotely.

Subjects:  A total of [ADDRESS_431332]  be met: women who 1) are able to speak English; 2) self -report HIV infection and 
submit a supplementary document  if necessary ; 3) are between the ages of 18 and 65; 4) have been smoking 
at least [ADDRESS_431333] 6 months; 5) own a mobile phone with  an access to a video call 
application such as Skype, Imo, Tango, and Face Time ; 6) are willing to quit smoking within the next 4 weeks 
from the baseline assessment; and 7) agree to use an ap proved form of birth control ( e.g., oral medications, 
condoms, and intrauterine devices ) during the study period. Individuals will be excluded if they: 1) are not able 
to speak English; 2) are pregnant or lactating; 3) have an active skin disease or seriou s alcohol use problems 
(≥ [ADDRESS_431334]  32), 4) self -report currently receiving treatment for a 
serious mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder); or 5) currently use any illegal  substances.  
 
Recruitment and Retention Procedures : We will recruit participants via adwords.google.com , craigslist .com,  
and other off line advertisements  such as advertisements on HIV/AIDS -related news magazines . We will first 
screen for eligibility and the following screening interview script will be used:   
 
1. Can you speak English? Yes  
2. Have you been diagnosed with HIV infection? Yes  
3. What kind of medications are you currently taking for HIV infection? (This question is asked as a way to verify HIV 
infection)  
4. How old are  you? In between [ADDRESS_431335] you been smoking a day?  [ADDRESS_431336] you been smoking? At least for the past 6 months  
7. Are you willing to quit smoking within the next four weeks? Yes  
8. Are you willing to use nicotine patches? Yes  
9. Do you have any active skin disease? No  
10.  Have you had emotional complications such as feeling anxious and depressed around quitting smoking?   No. If 
the caller answers “yes” to this question, we will ask whether the quit attempt was made with or without assistance.  
We will also ask the severity of the complication(s). If the caller answers that the complications were so distressing 
and required  treatment, she will be excluded from the study.  
11. Do you currently receive treatments (counseling and pharmacotherapy) for any of these illnesses: Depression, 
Alcohol Dependence, Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder? No  
12. Do you curr ently use any illegal substances except marijuana (weed)? No  
13. Are you pregnant? No  
14. Are you currently using any method of birth control?  Yes.  We will then ask the caller to specify what type of birth 
control she is currently practicing. If no, we will ask whether the caller is willing to practice birth control during the 
intervention period (3 months). Only those who use or agree to use an approved form of birth control (e.g., oral 
medications, condoms, Depo Provera injection, and intrauterine devices) will  be accepted into the study.  
15. Are you currently breast -feeding? No  
16. Do you agree to use birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_347120]? Yes  
17. Do you have access to a telephone and an Internet -connected computer? Yes        
 
 
Those who are determined to be eligible will receive an informed consent form as an image (the consent form). 
They will be asked to read the form and given an opportunity to ask questions  if they have any . After all 
questions answered, they will be asked to send  a text message  by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_347121] . The text message  will be photographed and kept  as a record . The participant then 
will be interviewed via telephone -based video  call for baseline questionnaires, which will take [ADDRESS_431337] eight 
weekly counseling sessions of a 30 -minute HIV -tailored cessation intervention (cognitive behavioral therapy 
plus nicotine patches).  
 
Study Procedures:  
 
1. Phase 1. Development of Narrative Videos: A video divided into t hree sections , each section for 5-7 
minutes will be produced by “Star” story tellers who are eloquent and have authentic personal experiences 
of quitting smoking. They will  be WLHIV identified in collaboration with the community organization of 
WLHIV “Healing Our Community Collaborative” . Each woman will share her personal journey of quitting 
smoking focusing on (1) why she decided to quit smoking, (2) what helped her quit, (3) how she avoided 
smoking temptations, and (4) what changes she made to continue abstinence.   
[ADDRESS_431338] of a Storytelling Narrative Communication Intervention: C ounseling content s will be 
primarily drawn from a cognitive behavioral therapy foundati on, which is guided by [CONTACT_347131]’s Social 
Cognitive Theory.33,[ADDRESS_431339] influential determinant of the 
behav ior and its appraisals are based on the following four: performance accomplishment, vicarious 
experience, verbal persuasion, and physiolo gical state. Participants will have eight weekly counseling 
sessions and the duration of the sessions is approximately 200-[ADDRESS_431340] every 
month and providing incentives for follow -up tests . Counselor s will proactively call participants prior to each 
therapy session and confirm the appointment a few hours before the session . A research assistant (RA) 
will conduct all follow -up assessments via telephone calls and video call  for saliva cotinine tests . 
Regardless of smoking status , participants  will receive a Visa gift card worth $25 at each follow -up 
assessment (post-quit 1 , 2, and  3 month s). Any participants who report abstinence at post -quit [ADDRESS_431341] worth $[ADDRESS_431342] worth $100.   
 
Individual counseling before the quit day.  The main focus of the first session will be assessing each 
participant’ readiness for smoking cessation and accordingly setting the target quit day. The day  will be 
usually set between the third and fifth sessions. Pre -quit sessions will be focused on pre paring participants 
for the quit day, which includes counseling to delay smoking the first cigarette at least [ADDRESS_431343] 
explaining neurobiological changes associated with nicotine addiction  and immediate health benefits of 
quitting. The session (usually the third or fourth one) right before the quit day will be focused on explaining 
the underlying treatment mechanism of transdermal nicotine patches  and gums . During the session, 
correct usage  of nicotine patches  and gums , their possible side effects, and how to manage the side 
effects will be educated. S kills training for situational smoking temptations will be provided with role plays 
so that participants can learn copi[INVESTIGATOR_347122].  
 
Individual counseling after the quit day.  Post-quit sessions will vary by [CONTACT_347132]. Thus, the number of cigarettes 
smoked for the past [ADDRESS_431344] -quit session using the 7-day Timeline  Follow -back 
Scale.35 Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale will be assessed prior to counseling at each session and 
participants will be counseled accordingly depending on severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms.36 
Participants will be counseled to utilize  the 4D (Deep breathing, Drink Water, Distract, and Delay) 
behavioral strategies when they experience nicotine withdrawal symptoms.37  
 
Nicotine replacement therapy.  Participants  in both arms will receive a free supply of nicotine patches  
(Habitrol  Patches, [COMPANY_001], Denmark)  via post office mail at two separate occasions: first 4 -week supplies 
of 21mg and then 2 -week supplies of each 14mg and 7mg together. Those who smoke between 5 -9 
cigarettes will receive 14mg for 6 weeks and then 7mg for 2 weeks . Those who report difficulty using 
patches due to skin reaction s and who earn a high score (≥ 7) on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine 
Dependence38,39 will receive nicotine gums (2 or 4mg, Habitrol Gums, [COMPANY_001], Denmark ). Adherence to 
nicotine patches  and gums  will be monitored asking  number of patches and gums that they have used  for 
the past [ADDRESS_431345]. 
She/he will also inform them that  they should not eat or drink for at least [ADDRESS_431346] strip 
(right below the three green arrows).  
 
A research staff member will closely monitor t he whole process via the video call. She/he will be blind to 
treatment condition. The person can read the result of the test when the blue line on top of the strip 
disappears, which usually takes 20 -30 minutes. She/he will ask participants to take a photo of the strip right 
after the video call and send it to her/him. Then, the person will share the photo with other research staff to 
validate one’s reading of the result.  
 
 
  
Study Measures and Assessment Procedures:  Baseline and three follow -up assessments will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_347133]. All measures (see Table 1 below)  have been tested and validated for use with WLHIV . 
Those who report abstinence will receive NicAlert® test kits at 3-month follow -up by a post office mail right before  
the follow -up assessments . As described above , participants  will be guided step -by-step to perform the test  while 
the whole process being closely monitored by [CONTACT_347134] a video call .  
 
Table 1 Assessment schedule of study measures  
 
 
Power and Sample Size:  This study aims to e stablish a preliminary effect size. In the currently ongoing study,  
abstinence rate for the video arm was 75.5% at post-quit 1 month but dropped to 20.0% at post-quit [ADDRESS_431347] at  a 5% significance level, [ADDRESS_431348] 80% of power for 
abstinence rates 45.5% vs. 20%.46 As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will recruit 50 subjects ( 25 per arm).  
      
Data Analysis:  Data analysis will be done in collaboration with the U54 Research Design and An alysis 
Core . Prior to data entry , data will be reviewed and double -checked for completeness and coding errors first by 
a research assistant  and then by a data manager. An intention -to-treat analysis strategy will be used for 
cessation outcome s with missing values.

Specific Aim 1 : Identify  storytelling narrative communication (SNC) intervention components that are rated 
high in transport and identification* for use as an enhancement to an HIV -tailored smoking cessation 
intervention (*Narrative Understanding, Attentional Focus, Narrative Presence, and Emotional Engagement).  
Through two local netwo rks of Black WLHIV in which Dr. DeMarco is a key collaborator , we will  identify 
volunteers who have quit smoking and film them while they tell their story of quitting. We will ask them 
structured questions based on Bandura’s Self -Efficacy Model to elicit the story components. When the film is 
edited effectively for clarity of content and length, it will be tested for acceptability  using a mix -methods 
approach. Using  focus groups the film will be shown and participants will be asked what they liked the most  
and the least about the film. These data will be analyzed for saturation through thematic analyses.  
 
Specific Aim 2 : Determine the feasibility and acceptability of an SNC intervention for  smoking cessation 
for WLHIV by [CONTACT_58833] 1) the rate of recruitment and retention  for feasibility and 2) the degree of transport  
and identification  for acceptability in the narrative enhancement.  We will identify and describe the time to 
recruitment and any barriers. We will also describe reasons for study refu sal and compare refusal rates by [CONTACT_347135], using χ2 and t -tests. We will compare attrition rates at each 
follow -up by [CONTACT_347136], using Mann -Whitney tests. Subjects will complete an 
Exit Survey, rating their overall satisfaction with the intervention that they have. They will also rate their 
experience with the SNC videos , using a 7 -point Likert -type scale.45 In addition, the Measure of Narrative 
Engagement will be used as a quantitative indicator of 1) narrative understanding, 2) attentional focus, 3) 
narrative presence, and 4) emotional engagement.19 
 
      
Specifi c Aim 3: Establish an effect size of HIV -tailored smoking cessation and SNC interventions in 
comparison with the HIV -tailored smoking cessation intervention only for WLHIV by [CONTACT_23992] [ADDRESS_431349] result higher than the cutoff level of 0 (cotinine level 0 -30mg/ml) will be all treate d as smoking. We 
will calculate an effect size by [CONTACT_23992] 3 0-day abstinence rates at 6-month follow -up point between the two 
arms. We will also explore longitudinal logistic regression models under the framework of generalized linear 
mixed models to exam ine the relationships between abstinence status and intervention conditions over time.  
 
 
PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
Consent  Form : The consent process described pertains to RCT subjects in Phase 2.  [CONTACT_32246] or research 
assistant (from now they will be referred to as research personnel)  will conduct a brief screening interview 
when a person makes an initial contact. If the person is not eligible, the research personnel will stop the 
interview and destr oy the data. If the person is eligible, the  research personnel will explain the purpose of the 
study and its procedure, including voluntar y nature  of study participation, and random assignment into one of 
two intervention conditions. The  research personnel  will then send f ive page photos  of the consent and allow 
time for the caller to read and ask questions. After having answered all questions accordingly, the  research 
personnel  will ask the caller to text her full name [CONTACT_347138] s to participate  in the study. Once the 
text message is received , the research personnel  will make a video call and collect  baseline data.  
Potential Risks:   This study constitutes minimal risks to subjects and interventions provided are accepted 
forms of treatment such as behavioral therapy and over -the-counter medications. Nevertheless, subjects may 
have the following potential risks. First,  subjects may experience nicotine withdrawal symptoms after quitting. 
Second,  they may also experi ence side -effects of ni cotine patches and gums . Although nicotine patches and 
gums are FDA approved first -line cessation  medications and relatively safe, some may experience side effects 
that require a medical attention. The most common adverse effect of nicotine patch is topi[INVESTIGATOR_347123] a more generalized skin reaction, frequently in subjects  with a history of 
eczematous dermatitis. The most common adverse effect of nicotine gum  are diarrhea , dry mouth , jaw pain, 
muscle pain , nervousness , sweating , and  weakness.  Other potential side effects  of nicotine patches and gums  
include hypertension, dizziness, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and abdominal discomfort.  Third , subjects  may 
feel uneasy and depressed  when they talk a bout their smoking particularly after relapsing to smoking. Fourth,  
potential risk is loss of privacy or breach of confidentiality.  
[ADDRESS_431350] Risks:  To prevent or minimize nicotine withdrawal  symptoms , we will provide via secured 
post office mails nicotine patches to all subjects and gums to those who earn a high score (≥ 7) on the 
Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence.[ADDRESS_431351] been found effective in dealing with the withdrawal symptoms. For 
example, students will educate smokers a variety of behavioral strategies to manage the symptoms such 4Ds 
(Distract, Drink water, Deep breathe, and Discuss). Students will educat e them about how and where  to apply 
a nicotine patch, what to do if the patch comes off, how to handle common issues such as taking a shower, 
and how to dispose of a used  patch. Students will also explain that they should chew nicotine gum slowly, until 
they feel a tingling sensation or a ‘peppery’ taste (usually after about 10 chews). Then rest it for one minute 
under their tongue, or between their cheek and teeth. This allows the nicotine to pass though the lining of their 
mouth. They  should conti nue this ‘chew - rest’ sequence for [ADDRESS_431352] the gum.  They 
should avoid eating and drinking 15 minutes before, and during, use of the gum (except for water). Acidic foods 
or drinks, such as orange juice, coffee, beer and soft drink, inte rfere with the amount of nicotine passing 
through the lining of their mouth from the gum.  
 
During sessions, counselors will educate side effects of nicotine patches /gums and their proper managements . 
They will provide a n emergency contact [CONTACT_6227] ([CONTACT_32246]’s  cell phone) to all subjects  and instruct them to call 
the number  if they experience any serious side effects of the medication  such as  nausea  and vomiting .  
Counselors will monitor every subject weekly for the first four weeks of the medication and monthly thereafter 
during the remaining 4 -weeks of the medication and at 1 - and 3 -month follow -ups. Nicotine intake during 
pregnancy is associated with  an increa sed risk for spontaneous abortion,  increased prenatal mortality, and with 
low infant birth weights.  The safety of nicotine in nursing infants has not been clearly established .  Thus,  we 
will exclude  pregnant women, nursing mothers , and women who are not u sing an acceptable form of birth 
control from the  study.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring: [CONTACT_32246] will document a dverse events , and share copi[INVESTIGATOR_347124]’ primary care provider if necessary after we obtain 
permission from subjects. [CONTACT_32246] will promptly  report to the IRB any unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects or others (i.e., events meeting the criteria described in section [ADDRESS_431353]. Kim will evaluate the frequency and severity 
of any adverse events and determine if modifications to the protocol or consent form are required.  
 
Confid entiality : All study procedures will be in accordance with the approval by [CONTACT_347137] . To ensure confidentiality, each participant will be assigned a unique study ID code, collected data will 
only be linked through a code number to any identifying information such as name [CONTACT_41319] . The 
file linking participants’’ names and code numbers will be stored in a locked file cabinet in the office of [CONTACT_32246] . 
All data obtained from participants will be kept confidential and only a ggregated, combined results will be 
reported.

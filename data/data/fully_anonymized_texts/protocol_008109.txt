****1.  BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE****  
1.[ADDRESS_520666] intends to fill? Include a brief review of past research 
in this area, numbering your citations to relevant literatur e as well as including them in the reference 
section #9.1.  
Warfarin is a common oral anticoagulant utilized in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic 
events and conditions. Although effective, the major complication associated with warfarin is the risk of major bleeding 
events. Incidence of major bleeding events in long-term warfarin users is 1.5% to 5.2% per year, with mortality exceeding 
13%. Among patients with an intracranial bleed, the mortality rate increases to 46%-55% [1]. In these situations, it is 
imperative to reverse the pharmacologic effects of warfarin quickly in order to minimize bleeding and reduce the risk of 
death. Warfarin inhibits formation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S. An 
international normalized ratio (INR) is a commonly utilized laboratory test to measure the amount of anticoagulation 
provided by [CONTACT_413174]. The INR is a standardized ratio utilizing prothrombin time to 
prevent  variation between institutional laboratories. Prothrombin time is defined as the time required for plasma to clot 
after addition of clotting factor. A normal INR in a healthy adult can range from 0.[ADDRESS_520667] a target INR slightly different than this therapeutic 
goal range depending on the indication. An INR <2 may put the patient at an increased risk of thromboembolic events, 
whereas an INR >[ADDRESS_520668] a n increased risk of bleeding. Warfarin reversal will need to be considered in patients 
presenting with a major bleeding event.  At Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we consider a warfarin reversal a reversal of the INR to less 
than 1.5.  The products that are approved for w arfarin reversal include vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 4 -factor 
prothrombin complex concentrate (4FPCC). 4FPCC contains all of the vitamin K -dependent clotting factors inhibited by 
[CONTACT_406190], making it desirable for use in warfarin reversal for emergent bleeds. Multiple guidelines currently recommend 
4FPCC over FFP for warfarin reversal in vitamin K -dependent major bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage [2 -5]. 4FPCC 
has a fast onset of action and has demonstrated significant reversal of INR within 1 0 minutes. Its duration of action is up 
to 8 hours, and for this reason it should be given concurrently with vitamin K [6]. Vitamin K has a delayed onset of action 
due to its need to stimulate the synthesis of clotting factors so its effects begin as the e ffects of 4FPCC diminish. 4FPCC 
is the standard of care treatment for this clinical population in the Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122066].  
 
The optimal dose of 4FPCC is currently unknown despi[INVESTIGATOR_413154]. The F DA-
approved dosing is 25 to 50 IU factor IX per kilogram of body weight, depending on INR.   It is dosed to a maximum of 100 
kilograms of body weight. The FDA -approved variable dosing algorithm is as follows: initial INR 2 -3.9: 25 IU/kg (maximum 
dose 2500 I U), initial INR 4 -6: 35 IU/kg (maximum dose 3500 IU), and initial INR >6: 50 IU/kg (maximum dose 5000 IU) 
[6]. Exact doses of 4FPCC administered may vary slightly from the calculated doses as the amount of 4FPCC differs 
based on the vials utilized. There h ave been studies evaluating the use of fixed doses and variable doses utilizing body 
weight, body weight in combination with initial INR, body weight in combination with initial and target INR, and physician -
chosen doses. Studies utilizing fixed doses or v ariable doses provided relatively good clinical and INR outcomes. Target 
INR outcomes were less achievable in studies util izing physician -chosen doses [7 ]. Currently, many hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], including 
Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], utilize the FDA -approved variable dosing base d on body weight and initial INR to guide 4FPCC dosing 
to reverse warfarin -induced anticoagulation for patients presenting with emergent bleeding or requiring emergent surgery 
while on warfarin anticoagulation therapy. The FDA -approved dosing strategy is e fficacious; however, its cost is significant 
to an institution. There were 67 cases of 4FPCC administration between January 2015 and May 2016 at Regions 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The mean dose administered was 3021 IU (range 1000 IU to 7000 IU) and the average cost was $7 ,236.17 
(range $2530 to $[ZIP_CODE]) per dose. .. If clinically effective, a lower dosing strategy by [CONTACT_3553] a fixed dose may cost less 
than the FDA -approved variable dose.  The lack of prospective studies eval uating fixed dosing regimens, especially in the 
[LOCATION_002], has hampered the emergence of fixed dosing as an optimal treatment regimen that is more cost effective. 
By [CONTACT_746] a prospective study comparing a fixed dose and the FDA -approved variable do se, fixed dosing may be 
comparable to the FDA -approved dosing in emergent warfarin reversal. This could provide significant cost -savings to 
institutions and benefit patients in need of emergent anticoagulation.  
 
Previous retrospective studies evaluating fix ed doses of 500, 1000, and 1500 IU of 4FPCC demonstrated adequate 
warfarin reversal. Target INR values of less than 2 and 1.5 were utilized in the majority of studies and were achieved in 
more than 90% of patients when a 1000 or 1500 IU dose was used  [8-11]. A systematic review of [ADDRESS_520669] similar efficacy whe n compared to variable doses [7 ]. A retrospective study 
published in 2015 and performed at Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) in Minneapolis, Minnesota anal yzed the 
results after implementation of a [ADDRESS_520670] that a fixed 1500 IU dose is sufficient to provide adequate 
warfarin reversal, as a target INR of less than 2 was obtained in 92.3% of patients and 71.8% of patients achieved an INR 
less than 1.5 [11 ]. The prim ary issue preventing widespread implementation of a fixed dose of 4FPCC is the lack of 
studies directly comparing a fixed dose to a variable dose, FDA -recommended dosing strategy. Furthermore, the relevant 
studies have been retrospective, with the exceptio n of one prospective study, which was performed in the Netherlands, 
providing little generalizability to the [LOCATION_002] population.  
1.[ADDRESS_520671] that support your proposal?  
Currently, Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413155] -approve d variable dosing for 4FPCC administration. There were 67 cases of 
4FPCC administration between January 2015 and May 2016 at Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413156] 
3021 IU (range 1000 IU to 7000 IU). On average, the cost was $7,236.17 (range $ 2530 to $[ZIP_CODE]) per dose. This mean 
dose is much higher when compared to studies that have utilized lower fixed doses and demonstrated adequate warfarin 
reversal. This may demonstrate that we are over -administering clotting factors when a lower fixed dose will be sufficient.  
Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413157] a prospective study evaluating the use of a fixed dose of 4FPCC compared to the 
FDA-approved variable dose.  
An observational cohort study published in 2011 demonstrated comparable efficacy betw een fixed dosing and variable 
dosing. The study examined three target INRs (<1.5, <1.8, and <2) depending on indication. Patients received 4FPCC as 
either a 1040 IU fixed dose or package -insert variable dosing. The median dose for patients in the variable dose cohort 
was 1560 IU. Target INR was achieved in 70% of patients receiving a fixed dose and 81% with variab le dosing [9 ]. Even 
though this finding was not significant, fixed dosing demonstrated a trend towards obtaining the INR goal. In addition, 
succes sful clinical outcome (bleeding cessation) was similar between the two dosing strategies as 91% of fixed dose 
patients obtained a successful clinical outcome compared to 94% of variable dose patients.  
An observational, prospective, non -inferiority, cohort  study published in 2012 compared a 1040 IU fixed dose of 4FPCC to 
variable dosing. The median dose for patients in the variable dosing cohort was 1560 IU. The study examined a target 
INR <2 for all indications. The target INR was reached by 91.7% of patie nts receiving a fixed dose, which was similar to 
the variable dosing cohort at 94.7%  [10]. In addition, the median INR obtained after 4FPCC administration was 1.48 in the 
fixed dose cohort and 1.4 in the variable dose cohort. A successful clinical outcome (bleeding cessation) was achieved in 
96% of fixed dose patients compared to 86% for variable dosing, ultimately demonstrating non -inferiority. Finally, the time 
to infusion was recorded and found to be significantly lower with the fixed dosing strategy com pared to the variable dosing 
strategy as the median time to infusion was 130 minutes and 160 minutes, respectively. This demonstrates that a fixed 
dose regimen reduces time to treatment.  This study was promising; however, it was performed in the Netherland s making 
its generalizability to the [LOCATION_002] less applicable.  
The retrospective study performed at HCMC demonstrated good efficacy for warfarin reversal as indicated by [CONTACT_413175]. Howeve r, these findings were not compared to a 
control group. Furthermore, patients receiving a fixed dose had good safety outcomes as no thromboembolic events were 
reported within 7 days after administration  [11].  Finally, significant cost -savings were achieve d through the use of a fixed 
dose of 4FPCC, with a cost avoidance of approximately $40,000 over the study period.  
1.4 What is the importance of the research to the scientific community?  
By [CONTACT_8246] a fixed dose of 1500 IU, presenting INR and body weig ht may not need to be determined prior to 
administration. This may allow for early administration and prevent delay for warfarin reversal in patients with emergent 
bleeding. This research may determine whether a fixed dose is effective for reversing warfar in to a target INR less than 
1.5 compared to FDA -approved variable dosing. In addition, the lower fixed -dose will significantly reduce costs to the 
institution.  
****2.  APPROACH****  
Some questions in this section do not apply to all study designs; please m ark Not Applicable as appropriate.  
2.1 Describe the study design (e.g., “This is a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of a guided 
imagery intervention on sleep quality”). Please see this List of Study Designs . 
This is a prospective, randomized trial to determine whether  a fixed dose of 4FPCC is comparable to the FDA -approved 
variable dosing for emergent warfarin reversal.  
2.2 How are you identifying eligible subjects or records? (e.g., clinic  visit, search of Epic, registry, etc.)  
 Not Applicable  
The emergency department (ED) research interns and critical care research center (CCRC) research staff will be utilized 
to identify eligible patients. When a patient presents with an emergent bleed o r requiring emergent surgery and is on 
chronic warfarin anticoagulation requiring 4FPCC use, the physician will notify the ED research intern or CCRC 
researcher. In addition, the CCRC intern is always in the emergency department and may notice a potentiall y eligible 
patient on the ED Track Board in EPIC. The intern would then notify the physician if he or she were not already aware of 
the patient. The ED research intern or CCRC researcher will then determine whether the patient meets the inclusion and 
exclu sion criteria for the study. If a patient is determined to be eligible and the physician approves enrollment into the 
study, the CCRC intern will immediately proceed with randomization. Once the patient is randomized, the physician will be 
notified of the dosing order from the randomization and the physician will place the appropriate order with the IV or ED 
pharmacist  depending on availability . EPIC will have a separate 4FPCC order specific for the research study.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_520672] and what are the study inclusion/exclusion criteria?  
All adult patients who are on chronic anticoagulation with warfarin and present to Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413158] ≥2 
(identified by [CONTACT_413176])  experiencing an emergent bleed or  requiring emergent surgery  are eligible for participation in 
the study . All eligible patients will be screened for the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:  
Inclusion Criteria:  
 Chronic anticoagulation with warfarin  and initial INR ≥2  
 Emergent bleedi ng (i.e. intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, u rgent invasive procedures, 
etc.) or u rgent surgery requiring reversal of INR to ≤1.5 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
 Younger than 18 years of age  
 History of heparin -induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)  
 Patients  without initial or post -administration INR readings  
 Patients with an initial INR < 2 
 Pregnant patients  
 Prisoners

2.5 Will you need to perform “preparation for research” activities prior to consenting subjects for research?  
 No 
 Yes 
x Not 
Applicable  
 
If you answered yes above, appropriate preparation for research activities prior to consenting subjects mus t 
include the following process to determine inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
 
1) Study staff will work with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_413159]. For example, this may include creating an Epic Workbench report  of patients who are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413160].  
 
2) Study staff may access medical records of all potential subjects’ identified (i.e., Workbench) to determine 
eligibility criteria using information that already exists in the medical record. During this process, no identifiable 
information may be recorded and any documentation made of a potential subject’s information that would 
disqualify them will be destroyed.  
 
If an eligible patient is not being cared for by [CONTACT_978], study s taff must approach the patient’s provider to 
determine if it is appropriate to proceed with the consent process.  
 
3) If additional testing needs to be done to see whether a patient meets criteria for entry into the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_413161].  
 
4)  If the preparation activity confirms a patient is a possible subject, PI/staff approaches the patient to begin the 
consent process.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_520674] the study data points from the patient’s EMR while the patient is in the Emergency Department 
and again at the time of discharge. The variables listed on the attached data collection form will be incorpo rated into a 
secure RedCap database that the interns will use to enter the data. All patients will be identified in RedCap with a study ID  
number that is not linked to identifying information in the database.  
 
Randomization  
 
Given the emergent nature of need for care with this clinical population, randomization will need to happen quickly 
following the physician decision to use 4FPCC for bleeding reversal. The CCRC intern is in the emergency department 
24/[ADDRESS_520675] e size of 48 patients (24 per group) , the 
randomization scheme will consist of 12 permuted blocks of four. Sealed envelopes with the dosing arm (fixed vs. weight -
based) will be in the research file in the locked medication room located in Pod E. Pod E is the area of the emergency 
department reserved for the most acute patients and is where these patients will be treated. All interns have badge 
access to the medication room. A filing box containing documents specific to ED research is located in th e medication 
room. Once the treating physician deems a patient eligible , the intern will retrieve the envelope from the medication room;  
open the envelope and the physician will enter the order. We do not anticipate that randomization will take more than [ADDRESS_520676]. Van  Amber will 
also review a mock patient for data abstraction to ensure that everyone is getting data points in the EMR from the same 
location. [CONTACT_413188] will train interns  on the randomization procedure.  
 
ED Staff Training  
 All attending physicians will be informed of the study at the monthly ED faculty meeting i n January . [CONTACT_413189] 
will lead this presentation and will answer any questions.  
 Residents will be informed of the study during the monthly Resident Rounds in January . This is a monthly [ADDRESS_520677]. Isenbe rger attends this meeting and will present the study to 
the residents.  
 ED nursing staff will be informed about the study during daily huddles in the Emergency Department. Huddles are 
held three times daily for the nursing staff so that all shifts are info rmed. CCRC staff will attend the huddles to 
inform nursing staff of the study and answer any questions. We have utilized this method of education in the past 
and it is the best way in which to reach all nursing staff. We will attend huddles for the two wee ks prior to study 
start.  
 
ED Pharmacy Staff  
ED pharmacy staff will be fully trained on the protocol by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Van  Amber and [CONTACT_413190]. [CONTACT_413190] is a senior 
pharmacist in t he emergency department and is the primary invest igator  on this study. [CONTACT_413191] is a PGY -[ADDRESS_520678]. Van  Amber will 
participate in training the pharmacy group.  
2.7 Describe any interventions that are used in this study.  
 Not Applicable  
Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either a fixed dose of 1500 IU or the FDA -approved variable 
dosin g based on body weight and presenting INR. The FDA -approved variable dosing algorithm is as follows: initial INR 2 -
3.9: 25 IU/kg (maximum dose 2500 IU), initial INR 4 -6: 35 IU/kg (maximum dose 3500 IU), and initial INR >6: 50 IU/kg 
(maximum dose 5000 IU). The patient weight will be obtained using a scale and documented by [CONTACT_413177]. 
Randomization will be initiated with the research team member notifying the attending physician  of patient enrollment, and 
the physician placing the order that is immediat ely visible in EPIC to the IV pharmacist preparing the medication . The 
pharmacist will prepare the study medication as either the fixed or variable dose. Exact doses of 4FPCC administered 
may vary slightly from the calculated doses as the amount of 4FPCC d iffers based on the vials utilized. The doses are 
unable to be blinded by [CONTACT_5051], as the fixed dose will have less drug volume.  
Following the randomization to study doses, the patient will be monitored for continued bleeding by [CONTACT_413178]. 
If the patient receiving the 1500 IU fixed dose remains in a bleeding state  and the INR remains above goal , an additional 
500 IU may be administered at the physician’s discretion to minimize bleeding and attempt to achieve hemostasis.  If a 
patient d oes receive the additional 500 IU dose, the patient will be included in the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis and 
considered a treatment failure for fixed dosing. (NOTE: this should be based on INR – not subjective assessment of 
bleeding)  
All patients on chro nic anticoagulation with warfarin who present with an emergent bleed or need for urgent surgery will 
obtai n an initial INR value via the i STAT point of care test  and a laboratory INR . Due to urgent need for administration of 
4FPCC, the laboratory INR may n ot be evaluated prior to randomization. After patient enrollment and randomization, the 
patient will receive the study medication and have a laboratory INR drawn [ADDRESS_520679] 4FPCC administration.  A 7-day follow -up period was 
chosen based on other studies  evaluating a 4FPCC fixed dose [ 11,12] . Enrolled patients  will be prospectively followed 
throughout admission with daily chart review to determine if a thromboembolic event occurred. The last patient progress 
note written within the [ADDRESS_520680] 
from start to finish (e.g.,  chart review, patient survey, follow -up visits, data pull from the electronic 
medical record, etc.) and who will conduct each. Please see our Example of Data Collection Steps . 
The current study will assess patient data among enrollees for the outcomes presented in section 1.1 :  
1) Treating physician will notify CCRC intern of potential study patient or the intern will notice the patient on the ED 
Track Board and notify the physician  
2) Patient identification and inclusion/exclusion screening performed by [CONTACT_413179]  
3) Physician approves the enrollment into the study  
4) The patient is randomized, the physician orders the randomization dose of study medi cation and obtains study 
medication from IV pharmacist  
5) Obtain initial INR  (this is standard of care, but also a data point used for this study)  
6) Obtain post -administration INR 15 minutes after 4FPCC administered  (this is standard of care, but also a data 
point used for this study)  
7) Document exact dose of 4FPCC administered  
8) Document whether an additional 500 IU dose needed for patient receiving a fixed dose  
9) Abstract timing from presentation to 4FPCC administration from EMR  
10) Abstract patient demographic informa tion from EMR  
11) Complete data entry into study  RedCap  database  
12) Complete follow -up evalua tion of thromboembolic events within  [ADDRESS_520681] 4FPCC administration

****3.  ANALYSIS****  
3.1 Describe the statistical methods that will be used to address the study aims. For each aim, this will 
usually include:  
 Description of the sam ple used for the particular analysis  
 The variables included in the specific analysis and their role in the analysis  
 Numeric summaries computed (e.g., mean, standard deviation, proportion, correlation)  
 A summary of data exploration and presentation activit ies (e.g., generating scatter plots, summary tables)  
 Description of statistical tests (e.g., independent samples t -test, Mann -Whitney test), and models constructed (e.g., 
logistic regression)  
Please see our Examples of Statistical Methods . 
Describe here:  
Note:  Please reference the area/pages of an established protocol if you are not writing your own analysis plan.   
The analytic study population will consist of patients e nrolled during the study period who meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria in Section 2.3 – namely, adults on long -term warfarin therapy who present to the ED with emergent bleeding, or 
who are in need of urgent invasive surgical procedures.  The exposure o f interest will be fixed vs. variable dose 4FPCC, 
to which eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_520684] 
appropriate statistical tests (Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables; Wilcoxon test for continuous variables) to iden tify 
any differences in the distributions of these factors.  If there are no significant differences (p<0.05) found, we will assume 
successful randomization, and subsequent statistical analyses will not additionally account for covariates.   
 
(Primary) Aim 1: Fixed vs. variable dose 4FPCC and anticoagulation reversal  
 
To evaluate whether fixed dose 4FPCC is accept ably comparable to variable dosing with respect to anticoagulation 
reversal, as defined by a targeted INR of ≤1.5, we will employ an active -controlled non -inferiority approach to analysis of a 
randomized trial [D’Agostino 2003].  In order to establish non -inferiority of fixed dosing, we will test the follo wing null and 
alternative hypotheses:  
 H0: F - V ≤ M  (Variable dosing is superior to fixed)  
 H1: F - V > M  (Fixed dosing is not inferior to variable)  
where V = variable dosing, F = fixed dosing, and M = the non -inferiority margin.  
 
Based on previous litera ture [ D’Agostino 2003, Goldstein 2015 ] and the available study sample, we propose to set the 
non-inferiority margin M to -0.1.  In other words, if the  proportion of warfarin reversal among fixed dose patients is no 
worse than 10 % less than the proportion o f warfarin reversal among variable dosed patients, then we will reject the null 
hypothesis (superiority of variable dosing), and consider the fixed dose to be acceptably n on-inferior to variable dosing.  
 
Results to be reported for this aim will consist of the proportion of reversal for each group, the risk difference (RD; the 
proportion of reversal in fixed group minus the proportion of reversal in variable group), and the risk ratio (RR; the 
proportion of reversal in fixed group divided by [CONTACT_132763] o f reversal in variable group), along with 95% confidence 
intervals and p -values as appropriate.  Non -inferiority will be established if the lower bound of the RD is greater than the 
pre-specified margin M ( -0.1).  The primary analysis will use an intent to  treat (ITT) approach (fixed vs. variable treatment 
assignment); however, we will also conduct supplemental analyses using an ‘as treated’ or ‘per protocol’ (PP) approach, 
in which we will compare patients’ actual received dose (regardless of assignment) w ith respect to successful reversal of 
anticoagulation.  We expect the PP approach to complement the primary ITT results, and will be informative particularly if 
there is non-trivial overlap in dosing by [CONTACT_413180].  
 
(Secondary) Aim 2: Fixed vs. varia ble dose 4FPCC and thromboembolic events  
 
Study patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_520685] -administration of 4FPCC for thromboembolic events, as defined in Section 
2.12.   For this outcome, we will calculate and report the risk (proportion of patients exper iencing an event in each group), 
RD, and RR, with 95% confidence intervals and p -values, as described in Aim 1.  While we expect the risk of 
thromboembolic events to be lower in the fixed dose group, due to the limited number of anticipated thromboembolic 
events in the study population, the study will not specifically be powered to detect statistically significant differences by  
[CONTACT_1695].  
 
 
 
(Secondary) Aim 3: Fixed vs. variable dose 4FPCC and costs  
 
Cost outcomes will be assessed for all study patients a nd compared by [CONTACT_413181].  Generalized linear regression 
models will be constructed to estimate the difference in cost attributable to dosing assignment ( β estimate), along with 
95% confidence intervals and p -values.  Specifications of the statistical models constructed will be dictated by [CONTACT_341154][INVESTIGATOR_413162], which we anticipate will be non -normal.  In this case, the negative binomi al 
distribution or other modeling assumptions may be used as appropriate.  
 
Sample size:  
3.2 What is the estimated sample size(s) for the primary study analyses (per group for studies with different 
arms or comparison groups)?  
Preliminary data from Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413163] [ADDRESS_520686] approval to enroll up to 60 
patients as more may present to the Emergency Department compared to our historical data.  
3.3 The sample size selected was (check all that apply):  
X Based on data likely to be available  during a specific time period (often based on data available in past periods)  
 To conduct one or more specific analyses with adequate statistical power  
 To achieve a specified level of precision in one or more key estimates  
 Other (explain):  
 
3.4 Explain your choice of the sample size selection you listed above:  
Sample size for this study will directly depend on the number of eligible patients on warfarin who present to the ED with 
bleeding emergencies during the study period.  
 
3.5 Describe your assum ptions concerning data available for analysis (e.g. How many subjects will be 
randomized, possibly lost to follow -up or a procedure? What do you expect for survey response rates, and 
how much missing data do you expect?). Include information as it pertains  to your study (human or animal).  
Our primary assumptions regarding available data include: 1) successful enrollment of eligible patients into the study; 2) 
complete data collection for relevant study variables; and 3) an even distribution of random assign ment (1:1).  
Missing data should be minimal, as the relevant clinical measures under evaluation are routinely documented in this 
context.  
We also expect loss to follow -up to be minimal, as the observation period for a given patient is very short (INR can be  
evaluated within 15 minutes of 4FPCC administration), and it will be unlikely for patients to leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413164].  Though it is possible patients may die during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], s ufficient information should be available for these individuals to contribute to the analysis, with the 
possible exception of Aim 2 (thromboembolic events).  
 
Power analysis  
NOTE: If you are doing a descriptive study (i.e., aside from computing confidence intervals you are not using statistical 
tests, inferential statistical testing for group comparisons, or statistical models), please complete 3.6 and skip 3.7 -3.8.   
If you are conducting statistical tests, using statistical inference to compare groups, or  are building statistical models, 
please skip 3.6 and complete 3.7 -3.8.  Please see our Example Power Analysis . 
3.6 Provide a measure of the precision of your estimates for key  study endpoints, (e.g., 95% confidence 
intervals on proportions or means), using actual expected estimates.   
N/A 
3.7 What level of differences observed in your primary endpoints would be considered clinically or practically 
significant?  
As dictated by [CONTACT_3433] e active -controlled non -inferiority approach, we will consider the fixed dose of 4FPCC to be non -inferior to 
variable dosing if the proportion of anticoagulation reversal is no worse than the specified difference margin of -10%.  
3.8 What is the power for y our primary analysis (and the set of assumptions underlying it: hypothesis 
addressed, expected pattern of effects with justification for these expectations, analysis used, variables 
in the analysis, effect sizes, sample sizes, alpha level, one or two -sided  test)?  
Assuming available treatment group samples of N=24, a non -inferiority margin of -0.1, an alpha significance level of 0.05, 
an expected targeted reversal proportion in the variable dosing group of 0.77  (pooled estimate from 13 previous studies) 
[Khorsand 2015], and a true difference in proportions of 0, we will have 22% power to detect non -inferiority of fixed vs. 
variable dosing of 4FPCC.  
3.9 What are the limitations of the proposed approach and analysis?  
The primary limitation will be low statisti cal power to reject the null hypothesis (superiority of variable dose 4FPCC) , given 
limited sample size .  Additionally, due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of treatment dosage assignment will not 
be feasible.  Finally, patient follow -up for thro mboembolic events at [ADDRESS_520687] statistical analysis.

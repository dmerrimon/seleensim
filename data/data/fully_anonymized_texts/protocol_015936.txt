INTRODUCTION 1.1         CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY Of the total worldwide population, 1% and 2% of rural and urban areas suffer from cardiac arrhythmia, respectively. Approximately 15% of patients do not respond to drug treatment and need a device-based interventional treatment. As a result, there is a great need for cardiac arrhythmia ablation. Today, however, the exact identification of the mechanism of the arrhythmia and subsequent successful ablation treatment are challenging for physicians. The three most prevalent arrhythmias (“complex arrhythmias”) for catheter ablation are atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia.  1.2         INTRACARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY SIGNALS DURING CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY STUDIES Cardiac electrograms are generated by [CONTACT_143275] (voltage) differences recorded at two recording electrodes during the cardiac cycle. All clinical electrogram recordings are differential recordings from one source that is connected to the anodal (positive) input of the recording amplifier and a second source that is connected to the cathodal (negative) input. Unipolar recordings are obtained by [CONTACT_143276] (referred to as an indifferent electrode) distant (theoretically an infinite distance) from the heart such that it has little or no cardiac signal.  Bipolar recordings are obtained by [CONTACT_143277]. At each point in time, the potential generated is the sum of the potential from the positive input and the potential at the negative input. The potential at the negative input is inverted and thus subtracted from that at the positive input. Because the far-field signal is similar at each instant in time, it is largely subtracted out, leaving the local signal. In a homogeneous sheet of tissue, the initial peak of the bipolar signal coincides with depolarization beneath the recording electrode. [2]  1.3         RATIONALE FOR THIS CLINICAL INVESTIGATION Electrograms and their interpretation are a key tool for electrophysiologists to target ablation sites and are acquired from electrodes on intracardiac diagnostic catheters and surface Electrocardiograms (ECGs). Besides the dominant noise contributor of 50/60Hz from the main power line, there are noise contributors from stimulation, ablation, and defibrillation artifacts that disturb the clear view of electrophysiological signals. Stimulation artifacts today are a result of (poor) software filter design, whereas ablation artifacts are mostly a hardware problem from the high energy exposure on the ablation tip electrode that is also used for measurements.   Baseline noise peak-to-peak levels below 15µV in bipolar recordings and below 30µV in unipolar recordings would be considered best-in-class. Bipolar recordings between adjacent band electrodes are the most commonly used and practically they are often “derived bipolar”. This means they are individual signals first amplified against a different but common reference, and then subtracted from each other. Unipolar recordings are important for advanced algorithms, such as 3D mappi[INVESTIGATOR_143262]-[ZIP_CODE]-A  CONFIDENTIAL CathVision   Page [ADDRESS_162939] often Wilson Central Terminal (WCT), but it can also be a distant intracardiac electrode.  Electrograms are usually sampled at 1 to 2kHz, and bandpass filtered at 30 to 500Hz for bipolar and 0.5 to 300Hz for unipolar recordings. 64 to 160 channels are the typi[INVESTIGATOR_143263]. In the operating room, other devices and technologies are present: 3D mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (triangulation of catheter tip position with impedance- and magnetic technology, <0.2 gauss), fluoroscopy/X-ray, Radiofrequency (RF) generator, cryo gas station, stimulator, saline coolant pump for ablation catheter RF-tip irrigation, hemodynamics, magnetic catheter steering (0.08T). It is not unusual to defibrillate the patient to cardiovert them from an arrhythmia. It is not unusual that patients have implanted cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). It is CathVision’s goal to develop a new electrophysiology recording system with improved signal quality particularly of unipolar recordings, with fast pacing and defibrillation recovery times, and with minimal or reduced RF ablation artifacts. The reduction in noise and artifacts will allow for better diagnosis and delivery of advanced ablation therapy in arrhythmia patients. 2.           DEVICE DESCRIPTION The CathVision ECGenius System is an electrophysiology (EP) recording system to be used in EP studies as a tool to monitor, display, and record signals of the heart and cardiac arrhythmias. The investigational device ECGenius System includes the following items: • EP amplifier (EPAMP) • Pin box cable assembly for connection of catheters • Surface ECG cable • Data cable to host computer • Recording system software (RECORDER SW) • Host computer (ECGenius PC) and monitors  2.[ADDRESS_162940]'s body or body fluids. There are no medicinal products, human or animal tissues or their derivatives, or other biologically active substances used in the device.  Each manufacturing lot of investigational device part is assigned a unique lot number that is printed on the device package labeling, providing a means of traceability. A device accountability log will be used to track the use of devices in the study.  The lot number will be recorded in each case report form.   3.           RISK-BENEFIT ANALYSIS There are no known risks to the potential subjects specifically associated with the use of the ECGenius®.  Potential risks include product failures similar to commercially available EP recording systems, with a similar likelihood of occurrence.   Risks associated with cardiac electrophysiology procedures include events reported in the literature related to catheter procedures, identified in the risk and hazard analyses, and associated with percutaneous interventions.  A list of anticipated adverse events are defined in Section 6.5.  Each adverse event and/or device effect will be evaluated in detail as described in Section [ADDRESS_162941] of care. Due to the protocol design and noninvasive nature of the tested medical device the rate of expected occurrence of SAEs or SADEs related to the use of the investigational device is low.   CathVision personnel will be responsible for the installation of the investigational device. During the study, the device will be operated by [CONTACT_143278].

EVALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES 6.1         ADVERSE EVENTS DEFINITIONS An adverse event (AE) is the development of an untoward medical occurrence or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to an investigational medical device, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational medical device.    
 
Protocol CP-[ZIP_CODE]-A  CONFIDENTIAL CathVision   Page [ADDRESS_162951] medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver), or clinically significant abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence which: • Results in death, permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure; • Results in serious deterioration in the subject’s health that either: o Is life-threatening; o Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143266]; o Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure; or o Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143267].   Adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of an investigational medical device.  Note, this definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device.  In addition, this definition includes any event resulting from use error or intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  Serious adverse device effect (SADE) is an ADE that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of an SAE.  An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined as any serious adverse effect on health, safety, any life-threatening problem, death caused by [CONTACT_1282], a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in predicate devices, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  6.[ADDRESS_162952] be listed in the cardiac history.

Protocol CP-[ZIP_CODE]-A  CONFIDENTIAL CathVision   Page [ADDRESS_162953]’s own words when possible.  Signs and symptoms that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or disease should be recorded as individual AEs on the CRF (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe headache are observed at the same time, each event should be recorded as an individual AE).    2. Duration: The date of onset and date of resolution should be reported.  Every effort should be made to capture the exact dates.  3. Outcome: The final status of the event should be reported as resolved, ongoing, or if it resulted in death.  If the event is present at the final study visit, the ongoing box must be marked.   4. Severity: The severity of the event must be reported as mild, moderate, or severe using the following definitions:  • Mild: Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated • Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity • Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity  5. Action taken: Treatment of the event may be reported as none, medical and/or surgical.   6. Seriousness: Determined by [CONTACT_143285] 6.1.  7. Relationship to device (study device or ancillary device) and/or procedure.  The relationship to device and study procedure will be assessed using the following criteria. • Not related: no temporal association or the cause of the event has been identified, or the device or procedure cannot be implicated. • Unlikely: the relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the event can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained. • Possible: temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; however, the involvement of the device or procedure cannot be excluded • Probable: the relationship with the use of the investigational device seems relevant and/or the event cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained. • Causal: temporal association; other etiologies are possible but unlikely.  If any AE is considered to be “possibly related” or “related” to the use of the study device, that event will be classified as an ADE or a SADE. Any reported AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_9673].

Documentation of the submission and receipt by [CONTACT_143290].  6.5         ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS There are no anticipated Adverse Events specifically associated with the use of the CathVision ECGenius® system.  Arrythmias requiring an EP procedure that are chronic but stable, and present at screening, should not be recorded as an AE.  Changes in a chronic condition or disease that are consistent with natural disease progression are NOT considered AEs and should not be recorded.  These medical conditions should be adequately documented in the subject’s cardiac history.  However, medical conditions present at enrollment that worsen in intensity or frequency in a manner inconsistent with the natural course of the disease during the EP and/or ablation procedures and during the study should be reported and recorded as AEs.  A recurrence of an atrial tachyarrhythmia requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143268] (AF) patients.  This will not be considered an adverse event.   Self-limiting pericarditis attributable to the ablation procedure, defined as pleuritic chest discomfort with or without pericardial rub and ECG changes, is not considered an adverse event.  The expected rates of occurrence of these anticipated AEs using the study device are expected to be the same as the rate experienced when using commercially available EP recording systems for the same indication.  The mitigations and treatments for these AEs will follow published guidance for the same AEs occurring with other commercially available devices [1].       Anticipated AEs include associate with arrhythmia and EP procedure, but are not limited to: • Air embolism • Allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) • Anesthesia reaction • Angina • Aorto-right atrial fistula • Arterial-venous fistula • Cardiac perforation/ tamponade • Cardiac thromboembolism • Cardiac or respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374] • Catheter entrapment • Cerebrovascular accident / Stroke  • Chest pain/discomfort • Congestive heart failure • Coronary artery dissection • Coronary artery spasm • Coronary artery thrombosis/occlusion • Death

One original informed consent form is to be retained by [CONTACT_143292] a copy is to be given to the subject or his/her legal representative.  The informed consent process must be documented in the subject’s source/medical record. 8.[ADDRESS_162961] be documented on the appropriate Protocol Deviation CRF.  If a Clinical Monitor becomes aware that an Investigator is not complying with the signed Investigator’s Agreement, the Clinical Study Protocol, the requirements of GCP/ICH Guidelines or other applicable regulations, or any conditions of approval imposed by [CONTACT_3488], the Sponsor or designee will immediately either secure compliance or terminate the Investigator’s participation in the investigation.  The Investigator will be required to return all investigational components of the study device and system unless this action would jeopardize the rights, safety, or welfare of a patient.  Protocol deviations will be analyzed by [CONTACT_143293].  Disqualification is warranted when an Investigator has repeatedly or deliberately violated governing regulations or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted false information in any report.  Where protocol deviations occur, which do not warrant disqualification from a study, the Sponsor or designee will implement appropriate corrective and preventive actions, including repeat training as deemed necessary.  8.6         STUDY TRAINING The study device is intended for use by [CONTACT_138559].  The Investigator and study staff will receive Sponsor-led training on the proper use of the device to ensure the study team is familiar with its use prior to study enrollment and participation.

  1.0 Background and Study Rationale  
1.1 Introduction 
Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) has become a common ablation procedure performed 
worldwide. The cornerstone of this procedure is pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Energy delivery may extend beyon d 
the atrial myocardium and result  in damage to adjacent structures, including the esophagus. Atrio- esophageal fistula 
(AEF) is a rare, but a well -recognized complication of percutaneous AF ablation with an estimated incidence of 
0.02– 0.11%1. Although the pathophysiology is not entirely understood,  it is clear that thermal injury to the esophagus 
during ablation of the posterior left atrial wall plays a crucial role in triggering a cascade of events that eventually results in the development of AEF. Common clinical strategies to prevent esophageal injury include delivery of lower ablation energy along the posterior left atrium as well as the use of a luminal esophageal temperature (LET) probe 
aimed to alert and guide energy delivery. Nonetheless, esophageal injury is still common, and AEF continues to be 
reported despi[INVESTIGATOR_286532].  
1.[ADDRESS_349376] assessed the outcomes of >[ADDRESS_349377]-time catheter ablation of AF followed by [CONTACT_286543] 4 days of the procedure. They found that 82% of patients 
had EGD without esophageal lesions and no subsequent esophageal events. Of the patients with esophageal abnormalities, two -thirds had erythema with no further complications. The 5 documented esophageal perforations 
occurred in patients with esophageal ulceration (ratio of esophageal perforation to ulcer, 1:10)
2. In a study performed  
by [CONTACT_286544] a previous institution that utilizes a similar technique as Penn, Tschabrunn, et 
al. found evidence of esophageal thermal injury in 9/20 (45%) on EGD the day after the ablation procedure3.  
1.[ADDRESS_349378]  
 
The EnsoETM is an FDA cleared device.  The EnsoETM is a non- sterile multi -lumen silicone tube placed in the 
esophagus for the purpose of cooling or warming a patient while simultaneously allowing gastric decompression 
and drainage. Modulation and control of the patient’s temperature is achieved by [CONTACT_286545]  (Medi -Therm Gaymar  or similar device ). Two lumens connect to the external heat 
exchanger, while a third central lumen provides stomach access for connection to a fluid collection device with low intermittent suction for gastric decompression. Distilled water circulates within the EnsoETM just  like a water 
blanket. The EnsoETM is made of standard medical- grade silicone. The versatile device can be placed by [CONTACT_286546], emergency room, or intensive care unit.  Providers placing devices will be 
appropriately trained.  The EnsoETM is a single -use, disposable, non- implantable device with an intended duration 
of use of 72 hours or less.  For this study, the device will be used during cardiac ablation procedures for the intended 
indication  of patient temperature management using approved settings/parameters as detailed in the product 
instructions for use document.   
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_349379] from thermal injury , with  transmurality of lesions decreas ing as circulating water temperature decreased
4.An 
in-vivo animal study using a different esophageal cooling balloon device has been performed. Using an animal 
model, Arruda, et al. demonstrated that the use of a compliant balloon device that circulates cold fluid between 5-
10°C can prevent collateral thermal injury to the esophagus5. In this study, the authors demonstrate that they were 
able to safely perform esophageal cooling to prevent esophageal thermal injury without adversely affecting the 
surrounding structures or the biophysical parameters of the radiofrequency ablation lesions5.

  1.3.2  Clinical Data to Date  
One clinical observational study has indicated that esophageal cooling can reduce thermal injury during AF ablation, 
but this strategy is not routinely used in clinical practice, in part  due to the absence of randomized clinical trial data 
to support its use. Sohara, et al. reported in an observational study that included 318 consecutive patients that 
esophagea l cooling can decrease the incidence and severity of esophageal thermal injury6. Leung et al. performed 
a meta- analysis of 3 clinical studies and found  that esophageal cooling reduces the severity of lesions resulting 
from RF ablation , with an odds ratio o f 0.39 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.89)7. Based on these animal and clinical prior studies, 
it is our hypothesis that the use of the EnsoETM device may reduce the occurrence and/or severity of esophageal 
thermal injury as it is a compliant balloon technology that can reach a cooling temperature of 4° C. In addition, it is 
FDA cleared and has been used safely in thousands of patients for temperature control making it the ideal device 
to use for this study . 
 
2 Study Objectives  
The purpose of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_286533] (EnsoETM) limits the frequency or severity of thermal injury during catheter ablation of atrial 
fibrillation.  
2.1 Primary Objectives 
1. To determine the occurrence rate of esophageal thermal injury between groups  
2. To determine the severity and size of esophageal injury between groups  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
1. Evaluation of posterior wall ablation parameters:  
o Initial temperature  
o Max temperature  
o Impedance drop  
2. Determine the occurrence and location of any acute PV reconnection between groups  
3. Determine freedom from AF at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months  
 
3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
This is a small scale pi[INVESTIGATOR_286534]  (EnsoETM) limits the frequency or severity of thermal injury during catheter ablation of atrial 
fibrillation.  This prospective, randomized study will include 70 patients to all ow for 60 completed patients  with 
symptomatic AF undergoing index PVI at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971]. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion with 30 patients (Group A) randomized to undergo the ablation procedure with esophageal cooling and 
the other 30 patients (Group B) will serve as the control group and will not have the EnsoETM device used. Patients 
randomized to Group A will have the EnsoETM device placed in the electrophysi ology  laboratory following intubation 
and prior to the ablation procedure.  All patients will undergo oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) 0- 2 days following 
the ablation procedure.   
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
 
Subjects will be recruited from the University of Pennsylvania’s Electrophysiology department.  Patients will first be 
pre-screened using the procedure schedule to identify those that are undergoing an initial AF ablation procedure 
and therefore may be potentially eligible for enrollment. Patients who  have met guideline recommendations for first -
time AF ablation procedure will be approached by [CONTACT_286547] ( co-investigators ) or a member of the research 
team prior to the AF ablation procedure.  All potentially eligible patients will first have  signed an informed consent 
for the clinical procedure by [CONTACT_128049] .  We will follow applicable University of Pennsylvania 
regulations and Pennsylvania law pertaining to consent process and obtaining signatures.  Written informed consent

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania  
  for the research study (use of EnsoETM + EGDs) will be obtained the morning of the clinical procedure prior to any 
research procedures taking place . 
3.1.[ADDRESS_349380] signed the research study consent form will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the study device (EnsoETM) or to standard of care (standard temperature probe monitoring). Insertion of the study device will be in place of the standard temperatur e probe and will not add any additional time to the standard AF ablation 
procedure.  The device will be used as indicated (for cooling) . Temperature measures will be collected for both the 
device and standard of care (SOC) arms during the clinical ablation procedure.   
 Ablation Procedure  (Day 0)  
All procedures will be performed using Penn’s s tandard approach under general anesthesia with  high- frequency JET 
ventilation. Using a double transseptal approach, wide circumferential isolation of the pulmonary veins will be performed with a point -by-point ablation approach. No additional left atrial ablation lines will be placed unless clinically indicated.  
All procedures will be performed with the use of CARTO 3 (Biosense Webster, Inc.) electroanatomical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_286535]- irrigated catheters (ST -SF Thermocool). Ablation in the anterior and septal aspects of the pulmonary veins 
will be performed using a power of up to 40W for a duration of up to 40s  unless, under the discretion of the attending 
physician, it is clinically necessary to use a higher index . Ablation on the posterior wall will be performed with a power 
of up to 30W for up to 20s.  Lesions will be delivered using a minimum target contact [CONTACT_286548] 10g. Successful PVI will 
be defined as achieving entrance and exit block of each PV with assessment for acute reconnection using adenosine 
and/or isoproterenol. Following PV isolation, high- dose isoproterenol challenge will be performed to guide additional 
extra- PV ablation.  Patients randomized to the device arm (Group A) will undergo posterior wall ablation when the 
EnsoETM device has reached a temperature of 4 -6°C for at least 10 minutes.   Temperatures on the device will then 
be adjusted to return  to nominal  approximately 20 minutes(at least)  after completion of the posterior wall ablation.  
 Endoscopic Evaluation (Days 0-2) 
All patients will undergo EGD 0- [ADDRESS_349381] who is blinded to the patient’s study group. Esophageal injury will be attributed to ablation if located on the anterior wall of the mid- esophagus (20 to 30 cm from the incisors). EGD findings of thermal 
injury  will be classified into four injury grades: ( 1) erythema – mild injury ; (2) superficial  ulceration – moderate injury ; (3) 
deep ulceration – significant injury; and ( 4) fistula/ perforation. Clinical interpretation of the EGD study will still be 
performed and reported in PennChart by a Penn gastroenterologist according to standard clinical guidelines .  
3.1.3  Follow Up Visit (Day 30 -14 /+30 days)  
Follow up data will be collected at approximately [ADDRESS_349382] of care 
procedures that will be done at these visits includ e: 
• Physical Exam  
• Interim History  and concomitant medication use  
• Vital signs  
In addition to the standard of care procedures, the research team will also collect the following:  
• Adverse event information  
• Atrial fibrillation recurrence  
If a participant does not attend their routine [ADDRESS_349383] of care follow up visits  that typi[INVESTIGATOR_286536]’s  electronic medical record (EMR) and will be reviewed by

5 Study Intervention  
5.1 Description 
The EnsoETM is a non- sterile multi- lumen silicone tube placed in the esophagus for the purpose of cooling or 
warming a patient while simultaneously allowing gastric decompression and drainage. Modulation and control of 
the patient’s temperature is achieved by [CONTACT_286551]. Two lumens 
connect to the external heat exchanger, while a third central lumen provides stomach access for connection to a fluid collection device with low intermit tent suction for gastric decompression. The EnsoETM is made of standard 
medical -grade silicone. It is a single- use, disposable, non- implantable device with an intended duration of use of [ADDRESS_349389] until the ablation procedure is 
completed. These patients will undergo posterior wall ablation when the EnsoETM device has reached a temperature 
of 4-6°C for at least 2 minutes. The device will be set to nominal temperature (no cooling) during other aspects of 
the procedure.

6.2.1  Visit 1/Day 0 ( Screening, Enrollment, Randomization, and  Ablation )  
 
Study personnel will assess each subject  against each inclusion and each exclusion criterion and the Investigator 
will determine the subject’s eligibility for study participation.   Appropriately delegated study staff will review the 
consent form  with subjects . The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_286538], the procedures to be followed, the potential benefits and 
risks, and other issues mandated by [CONTACT_286554]. Delegated study physicians, will di scuss the 
device/risks/benefits and obtain documented consent.   Before or after the discussion of risks and benefits of the 
experimental product by [CONTACT_5989], a study nurse or clinical coordinator may consent the research 
subject with respect to all other aspects of the research. The participant will be given the consent form for review 
and will be given the time to ask questions and have them answered.  The participant will be asked if they would 
like to participate, and if so, this will be documented using the study ICF.  Determining the eligibility for each participant will require information generated during the course of routine clinical care as dictated by [CONTACT_286555]. Selected testing data will be collected in order to characterize the type, cause and severity of the patient’s AF and the treatments received prior to enrollment. The data will include information from the 
evaluations listed below.  
 
Once the Investigator has reviewed and signed the eligibility checklist, the research staff will enter the participant’s information into the RedCap system to obtain the randomization assignment.

7 Statistical Plan  
Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of this study will be the occurrence rate of esophageal thermal injury , the severity  (Grade 1-
4) of thermal injuries, and number of distinct injuries present. This will be assessed by [CONTACT_286559].   
7.1 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include:  
1. Evaluation of posterior wall ablation parameters:  
• Number of posterior wall ablations  
• Total posterior wall ablation time 
• Biophysical parameters (power, time, temperature, impedance changes, contact [CONTACT_17611])  
 
2. Occurrence and location of any acute PV reconnection  
3. Freedom from AF at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months  
7.2 Sample Size and Power Determination  
Based on prior studies, esophageal injury following ablation is anticipated to be approximately 35% in the control 
group. However, as we do not know the occurrence rate of the primary outcome of esophageal injury using the 
Penn ablation technique that would represent the control group nor in the device arm we are unable to accurately 
perform a power calculation for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. We believe that a total of [ADDRESS_349401] 
lesions identified pe r patient  for comparison between patient groups . The score will be a four -digit number WXYZ 
where each digit represents the number of lesions at each severity level  per patient  defined as:  Z: Grade 1; Y: 
Grade 2; X Grade 3; W: Grade 4. This will be inputted into the following formula in order to calculate the thermal 
injury score for each patient: Score = 1000*W + 100*X + 10*Y + Z .   
7.3.[ADDRESS_349402] descriptive statistics (including mean and standard deviation for continuous variables such as age and standard percentages for categorical variables such as gender).  
7.3.2  Efficacy Analysis  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_286540]/or reduction of esophageal thermal injury during atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. This analysis will be performed using the calculated esophageal lesions score as described above based on the primary outcome data of thermal injury occurrence rate, severity (Grade 1- 4) of injuries, and number of distinct injuries present between study groups.

Serious injury:  
Any injury or illness that is any one of the following:  
• life-threatening  
• results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure 
• necessitates medical  or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or 
permanent damage to a body structure  
8.1.2  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the 
course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372] 
 
8.1.3  Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious  or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical 
significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania  
   
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria  for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events.  
8.1.4  Unanticipated Problems (UP) Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study -related documents such as the IRB-
approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a reasonable 
possibility that  the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_226592])  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
8.1.5  Preexisting Co ndition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded 
as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
8.1.6  General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
8.1.[ADDRESS_349406] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to par ticipation in this study.

event.   
 Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery 
was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_349407], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by  [CONTACT_71997], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source 
document, and also in the appropriate adverse event case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and clinically significant abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though 
should be grouped under one diagnosis.

  All adverse events occurring during the study period (consent through Visit 3 – 1 month follow up) will be recorded.   
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that 
the study intervention or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of 
the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.3 Classification of Adverse Events  
 
Severity  
 
• Grade 1 : mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention is not 
indicated.  
• Grade 2: moderate ; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is indicated; limiting to age- appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc).  
• Grade 3 : severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_286542]; disabling; limiting to self -care ADL (self -care ADL refers to bathing, dressing 
and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
• Grade 4 : life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention is indicated.  
• Grade 5 : death  due to an AE.  
  
Relatedness  
 
 1) Definite: the AE is clearly related to the research procedures  
 2) Probably: the AE is likely related to the research procedures  
 3) Possible: the AE may be related to the research procedures  
 4) Unlikely: the AE is doubtfully related to the research procedures  
5) Unrelated: the AE is clearly not related to the research procedures  
 
Expectedness  
AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or were unexpected, meaning not anticipated 
based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label.  
 
Expected:  an AE known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study.  
 OHRP defines an u nexpected AE  as any AE occurring in one or more subjects participating in a research protocol, 
the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either:  
1) the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved in the research that are 
described in a) the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document, and b) other 
relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
 
2)  the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition   of the subject(s) experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE.

  8.5 Expedited Reporting of Events  
Any study -related unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of serious adverse e vent 
or unanticipated device reaction,  will be reported to the IRB and funding sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event.  Investigators will use the appropriate SAE/UP CRF to record events and a line item will also be added 
to the AE log CRF.  
 
The minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the initial  expedited event  report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study intervention was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study intervention  
 
 
8.5.[ADDRESS_349409] has  not resolved at the time of the initial report and new 
information arises that changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant 
new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all events are followed until either resolved or stable.  
8.5.2  Sponsor reporting: Notifying the Funding Sponsor   
Electronic notification of any adverse events related to the use of the EnsoETM study device will be sent to the funding  sponsor as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_36749].

  • The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
 
9.2 Data Collection and Management  
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_286560].  Source and CRFs will be 
entered into a RedCap data management system (DMS) .  Part icipants will be assigned a Participant ID “PID ” for 
use on CRF data collection in for entry into the DMS to protect and ensure confidentiality .  
 Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual 
case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in  black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct 
such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such 
changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or 
uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.   
 The study data will be stored indefinitely.  A de- identified data set may be shared with the funding sponsor.   
9.3 Records Retention  
Study records, including administrative and participant related source and CRFs, will be retained for 7 years after the completion of the research (often marked by a final progress report).   
 
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
The investigator and research team will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will 
also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above 
noted study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. clinical EP laboratories), and has adequate space 
to conduct the monitoring visit.  
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], government regulatory 
bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the 
capability for inspections of appl icable study -related facilities.  
 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_17256].

agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be 
provided to the funding sponsor before commencement of this study  if required . The formal consent of a subject, 
using the IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The 
consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_17257], and the appropriately delegated 
research staff obtaining the consent.  
11.1 Risks  
Risks of the ablation procedure will be explained using the clinical procedure consent.  
 
Additional risks of the study procedures are described below:  
 
EnsoETM device risks:  Placement of the EnsoETM device, similar to any device in the esophagus, can result in or 
exacerbate es ophageal tissue damage, particularly in patients with known esophageal deformity or evidence of 
esophageal trauma.  We believe these risks are similar to those whom receive the standard of care temperature 
monitor probes inserted into the esophagus during routine clinical procedures.   
 
 
EGD procedure risks :  Diagnostic upper  endoscopy procedures are considered very safe and rarely can result in 
complications including bleeding, infection, and/or perforation.  Large studies have reported the occurrence of any 
adverse event anywhere from 1 in 200 to 1 in 10,000 patients with major complications or death extraordinarily 
rare8.  
 
Loss  of Confidentiality Risks :  there is the potential for loss of confidentiality during data collection.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_349413] benefits to the participants in this study.  There may be a benefit to cooling the esophagus 
to reduce or prevent damage during the ablation procedure.  The knowledge gained by [CONTACT_286561] a whole in the future and potentially lead to additional studies.  
11.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
The risks of participating in the study are outweighed by [CONTACT_286562].  
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
Participants will be provided an IRB approved consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information 
for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. A verbal review of the consent form 
will take place with the participant and delegated personne l. This consent  form will include HIPAA authorization 
language which will also be reviewed with the participant.  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved 
consent form, will  be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be 
signed by [CONTACT_17257], and the investigator -designated research professional 
obtaining the consent. The participant will be consented in a private clinical space and will be given ample time to ask questions and have questions answered.  As the majority of the procedures that will occur are standard of care, 
we will clearly discuss what the research part of the day and days after will include. The voluntary nature of the 
study will be reviewed and participants will be told that should they choose not to consent, their clinical care will not be effected.

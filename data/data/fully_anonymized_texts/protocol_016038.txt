 Page 4 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  1.0 Objectives  
The primary study objectives are to determine the amount of L id W iper 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_15424] (LWE) induced in subjects  after contact [CONTACT_758175] . Subjects in the trial will be fit in [ADDRESS_1037898] lenses  
with different coefficients of friction (CoF ). One eye will be fit in a contact [CONTACT_758176] a low coefficient of friction  (Acuvue Oasys ®, [COMPANY_012] Vision, 
Jacksonville FL)  while the c ontralateral eye will be fit in a contact [CONTACT_758177] a 
high CoF  (Air Optix® Night & Day® Aqua , Ft. Worth, TX) , as reported in the 
scientific literature . The eye receiving each lens will be assigned randomly. The 
presence of LWE will be assessed at 2 different time points:  
• Approximately [ADDRESS_1037899] lens fitting  and 
• After 7( ±2) days  of contact [CONTACT_758178]: Contact [CONTACT_31447] a greater coefficient of friction  will induce 
a greater amount of LWE  than contact [CONTACT_31447] a lower coefficient of friction.  
The presence of LWE will be assessed at 2 different study time points . As such, 
the following hypotheses will be tested: 
 
After one week of contact [CONTACT_13279]  
• H01: There is no statistically signific ant difference in the amount of 
LWE between contact [CONTACT_758179]   
• Ha1: There is a statistically significant difference in the amount of 
LWE between contact [CONTACT_758180] [ADDRESS_1037900] lens wear  
• H02: There is no statistically significant difference in the amount of 
LWE between contact [CONTACT_758179]  
• Ha2: There is a statistically significant difference in the amount of 
LWE between contact [CONTACT_758179]   
 
2.[ADDRESS_1037901] lens wear  remains a significant 
problem , with up to 34% of patients discontinuing lens wear. Contact [CONTACT_758181]. There are many 
factors that may play a role in contact [CONTACT_367085], but the primary factor may be the interaction of the eyelid and the contact [CONTACT_709612]. It has been proposed 
that reduced contact [CONTACT_758182], a measure of the frictio n inherent to a contact 
[CONTACT_709612], may lead to increased contact [CONTACT_61544] . Contact [CONTACT_758183] (CoF)  of the contact [CONTACT_709618] . CoF has been reported to be inversely proportional t o reported contact 
[CONTACT_367085];  therefore, materials with a higher CoF tend to be less comfortable.

possible clinical corollary for CoF is Lid Wiper Epi[INVESTIGATOR_15424] (LWE), which has  
been reported to be related to contact [CONTACT_61544]. LWE leads to a loss of 
superficial epi[INVESTIGATOR_758166]. If CoF is indeed 
related to contact [CONTACT_61544], subjects wearing a high CoF lens could 
potentially develop greater amounts of LWE compared to that observed with a 
low CoF lens .  
While previous studies have determined the amount of LWE present in habitual contact [CONTACT_758184]- contact [CONTACT_93907], it is currently unknown how 
quickly LWE may develop in patients after contact [CONTACT_224044]. Development of 
LWE in the post -contact [CONTACT_758185]. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_758167] ([ADDRESS_1037903] -fit) and after approximately [ADDRESS_1037904] meet the following study inclusion criteria: 
1. Must be able to read  and understand the study informed consent  
2. Must be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1037905] lens wearers (neophytes), or experienced 
contact [CONTACT_758186] l enses for a minimum 
of [ADDRESS_1037906] a spherical equivalent refractive error between –0.75 to –6.50DS  at 
the spectacle plane  
5. The subject must be able to attend study visits at the prescribed visit times and adhere to the study instructions  
Potential study s ubjects cannot meet any of the following study exclusion criteria:  
1. Pregnant and/or lactating females by [CONTACT_6270] -report  
2. Presence of current LWE on the upper eyelid (>0.5 in height or width)  
3. Has greater than –1.00DC of refractive cylinder  
4. Has greater than 1.00D of anisometropia  
5. Is aphakic  
6. Has clinically significant corneal or conjunctival staining that would prevent contact [CONTACT_224044], as assessed with sodium fluorescein dye

Johns on Syndrome, etc.)  or significant Dry Eye Syndrome  
8. Has clinically significant corneal vascularization or central corneal scaring  
9. Has active ocular surface infection (e.g. conjunctivitis)

ocular surface health  
13. Has taken part in another contact [CONTACT_758188] [ADDRESS_1037907] eyes photographed or video recorded  
Potential subjects will be  initially  screened for study eligibility  through collection 
of demographic data and medical history . An upper age limit for study inclusion 
is set at 46 years of age to 1) prevent the inclusion of presby[CONTACT_35577] (i.e. 
those that need bifocal glasses), given that the contact [CONTACT_758189] 2) reduce the number of individuals who would 
screen fail due to significant dry eye disease.  Subjects will comp lete a 
questionnaire, the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), and subjects with a 
score ≥23 will be excluded from the study. A s lit lamp evaluation  will be 
performed to  screen for  the presence of LWE  of the upper lid and for significant 
corneal/conjunctiv al staining that would prevent contact [CONTACT_224044]. If the subject 
does not have LWE, the subjects will be refracted to determine eligibility  based 
on their refractive error. If the refractive error is within the study specified 
inclusion criteria, the su bject will be fit into contact [CONTACT_13276].  
4.0 Vulnerable Populations  
The following vulnerable  populations will be excluded from the study:  
1. Adults unable to consent  
2. Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers under the age of 18)  
3. Pregnant/lactating women  
4. Prisoner s 
The following vulnerable  population may be included in the study:  
1. Students for whom the principal investigators have direct access to/influence on grades .  
 Study subjects may be students for whom the principal investigators have access to or influence over their grades. For this reason, the principal investigators will not be responsible for recruiting or obtaining consent from students in their own

 Page 17 of 20  Revised: June 18, [ADDRESS_1037941] for the duration of the study. Subjects will be provided 
with a token for parking  at each study visit ( if necessary ). Subjects that complete contact 
[CONTACT_224044] (i.e. that is completes both study V isit 1 .1 and 1.2)  will be compensated $30.  
Subjects who complete the 1- week follow up will be compensated $10. If subjects are 
determined ineligible at screening (screen fail), the subject will be compensated $5, with the opportunity for a total of [ADDRESS_1037942] 
reimbursement (without rescreening visits) will be $40. Subjects will be compensated using Amazon electronic gift cards in the amounts indicated above, delivered to the subject via an e -mail address provided by [CONTACT_423], after completi on of their last study 
visit. Subjects who fail to complete a visit will not be compensated for that visit. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_758172].   
 
15.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
 The risks to subjects from participation in the study are minimal. The clinical procedures used in the study (slit lamp biomicroscopy, non- invasive tear break up time) are 
commonly used clinical procedure in optometry and ophthalmology and may cause some discomfort due to light shining on the surface of the eye , during ocular surface tear 
collection  or during contact [CONTACT_13279] . In the rare case that a subject is injured as part of 
their participation in the study, the subje ct will be responsible for any associated medical 
bills.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_1037943] identifiers. A key to the study code will be maintained for 3 years  at the time of study completion ( i.e. Last Subject, Last Visit) .  
 
Any source documents with patient identifiable information will be kept only at the local site (inf ormed consent form, linking log). Individual documents will be kept in a secure 
room in the Ocular Surface Institute (TOSI).  
  
17.[ADDRESS_1037944] in a quiet, private area and as much time as necessary will be spent discussing 
the details of the study.

 Page 18 of 20  Revised: June 18, [ADDRESS_1037945] (HIPAA) authorization form will be 
included as part of the Informed Consent process.   
 
The linked PHI will be destroyed upon completion of the study. PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which the use or disclosure of protected health information for which an authorization or opportunity to agree or object is not required by 45 CFR 164.512.   
 
20.0 Data Management  
 
Paper source documents ( i.e. case report forms ) will only be asso ciated with a subject ID 
number and will not contain direct subject identifiers . 
 
21.0 Specimen Use and Banking  
The tear specimens will be stored in a - 80°C freezer until luminex multibead 
analysis. The specimens will be stored for up to [ADDRESS_1037946] access to the 
specimens.  
 
22.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects  
 
There are no plans to share study results with subjects as it will not directly be nefit their 
eye/vision health. If findings are discovered during the trial  that potentially have an 
impact on the subject’s health or wellbeing, the subject will be educated to these findings.

 Page 19 of 20  Revised: June 18, 2021  The study team completed all necessary ethics training requirements. The co -PIs (Eric 
Ritchey, OD, PhD and Rachel Redfe rn, OD, PhD) have over a decade of clinical research 
experience conducting clinical studies and will oversee the other study personnel.  
The number of subjects to be recruited is based on the typi[INVESTIGATOR_758173]. With an abundance of contact [CONTACT_758209], we believe that we should be able to 
complete enrollment within 3 months.  
This study utilizes the clinics of The Ocular Surface Institute to see study subjects on the 
campus of the University of Houston.

Addendum: Statistical Analyses  
 
Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS v26 (IBM) and GraphPad. When data were 
not signi ficantly different from a normal distribution (non- invasive tear break up time, 
tear meniscus height), statistical analyses were conducted using paired t -tests and 
repeated -measures analyses of variance (RM -ANOVA), with adjusted post -hoc t -tests, 
when appr opriate. For NITBUT and TMH, the RM -ANOVA included two repeated 
factors —lens type (Acuvue Oasys and Air Optix Night and Day) and time (baseline, [ADDRESS_1037947] -fitting and 7 days after lens fitting). For data that was not normally distributed 
(LWE staining),  Friedman and Mann- Whitney non- parametric statistics were performed.  
MMP concentrations were adjusted by [CONTACT_758210]. Tear film MMP concentrations under the level of detection (LOD) were divided by √2 (Croghan et al. 2003) . Outliers in MMP data sets were analyzed using the ROUT function 
in Graphpad Prism 8.4.1 and were removed prior to analysis.

Study Protocol , Statistical Analysis , and Results  
Study Protocol  
Participants who responded to invitations to voluntarily participate completed the 
Physi cal Activity Readiness Questionnaire  (PAR -Q+) (Warburton  et al.  2011) , followed by a 
questionnaire to rate their current stage of change (SOC) from the Transtheoretical Model 
adapted to assess exercise/postural modification behavior change . On this questionnaire, 
participants also responded to a yes/no question regarding if they have had a recent injury to their 
head, shoulders, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; or have ever been diagnosed with a pathology related to their 
cervical/thoracic spi [INVESTIGATOR_623012], as part of exclusion criteria for the study. Participants then 
underwent a head posture screening with the use of photogrammetry . Screening  was performed 
by [CONTACT_606612] a licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_623013] & Motion Analysis Laborat ory.  
Participants were asked to arrive at the lab wearing either a tank top or t -shirt, as well as 
to have their hair tied back if necessary. Heig ht and weight were measured using a digital scale 
(Health -o-meter Professional, model 500KL, McCook, IL). Participants were instructed to sit 
comfortably on a stool with hands resting approximately two -thirds down their thighs with palms 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_623014] 90 degrees ( Richards et al.  2016 ); 
and to look straight ahead at an opposite wall in the laboratory ( Kim et al . 2016 ). A digital 
camera (Canon Powershot, model SX540, Tokyo, Japan) was mounted and leveled on a tripod 
(Manfrotto, model 055, Cassola, IT) and placed three meters away from the subject  (Ruivo  et al.  
2014 ). Two photographs were taken of participant’s posture ( Kim et al.  2016). Immediately after 
data capture, image files were uploaded into Kinovea video analys is software (version 8.15) for 
CVA assessment.  On each image file, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_623015]: the first line drawn from the tragus of the ear to  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_623016] C7 vertebrae and the second line drawn horizontally through C7 spi[INVESTIGATOR_18239]  (Kim 
et al.  2016 ). A second  researcher directly observe d the PI [INVESTIGATOR_623017], as well 
as provided verbal agreement with the a ccuracy of angle measurement. For each p articipant , the 
CVA was derived by [CONTACT_623026] s (Kim et al.  2016).   
Inclusion criteria included completion of informed consent, cranioverte bral angle ≤ 53 
degrees ( Lee et al.  2017 ) and self -rating of Transtheoretical Model stage of change stage ≥ 3/5 
on a questionnaire to indicate their readiness to comply with an assigned exercise prescription or 
postural guidelines ( Kuroda et al.  2012). Exclusion criteria  consisted of a ny musculoskeletal 
injury to the head, shoulders, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_623018]; diagnosis of pathology related 
to the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or upper extremities; or non -clearance for physical activity 
based o n results of the PAR -Q+ questionnaire.  A total of 79 participants met inclu sion criteria 
and were included in the study.  
Randomization of participant group assignments was completed by [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_2329] a block 
randomization generator on a website ( http://www.randomization.com ). Utilizing a sequence 
created by [CONTACT_623027], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_623019]: (PE; n = 20 ), self-myofascial release + stretching (SMRS; n = 20),  self-myofascial 
release  + stretching  + strengthening (SMRS S; n = 19 ), and control group (CG; n = 20).  A hard -
copy of the sequence generator report was kept concealed in a manila folder and was only 
opened by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_623020]. Participants and researchers were not blinded to group 
assignment.  
Intervention Groups  
 
Postural Education (PE) Group . Immediately after baseline posture assessment, PE 
group members received a one -time [ADDRESS_829625] head postur e (Bayattork et al.  2019; Cuellar & Lanman  2017; Kalichman et al.  
2016; Hansraj  2014; Lau et al.  2010); postural guidelines for using mobile electronic devices 
(Abdelhameed & Abdel -aziem  2016; Gustaffson  2012; Syamala et al.  2018), desktop computers 
(NIH  2021), laptop computers (NIH  2021; Sahu et al.  2021), and rest break guidelines (Kim & 
Koo 2016; Neupane et al.  2017; Vate -U-Lan 2015; Kar & Hedge  2020; Carter et al.  2018; 
Engelmann et al.  2011). At the conclusion of the educational session, each PE group participant 
was emailed a copy of the presented educational information and guidelines. A weekly email 
was sent to group members during the 4 -week intervention period to provide reminders and 
encouragement to adhere to postural guidelines. Participants were asked not to begin any new 
exercise program or alter their current phy sical activity level over the next four weeks.  
Self-Myofascial Release + Stretching  (SMRS) Group . Immediately after baseline 
posture assessment, SMRS group members received a 15 -minute in -person one -on-one 
standardized instructional/training session for the SMRS intervention provided by a research 
team mem ber in the laboratory. A 12 x 6 x 6 inch high -density myofascial roller (NASM Tool, 
Cygnet Systems, Dallas, TX) and a 23 -inch soft -tissue mobilization tool (STMT) (Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s 
Choice® Pressure Point Hook Cane, Tampa, FL) was provided at no cost to group me mbers to 
enable implementation of a 4 -week home program. Implemented protocols followed the National 
Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) recommendations for inhibitory and lengthening 
techniques ( Fahmy  2022 ). Participants were instructed to apply self -myofa scial release (SMR) to 
the thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (TS) using the myofascial roller by [CONTACT_623028] 30 seconds, followed by [CONTACT_623029] (up + down equaling 1 repetition ) over a 90 second time period to promote mobilization of 
restricted myofascial tissues and restoration of upright posture (Fahmy  2022). Participants were 
asked to apply SMR to the center of the muscle belly in bilateral sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and 
uppe r cervical extensor (UCE) muscles using self -applied pressure with fingertips, while the 
STMT was utilized to administer SMR to center of the muscle belly in bilateral upper trapezius 
(UT) muscle and pectoralis minor (PM) muscle for 30 seconds (Fahmy  2022 ). For the first two 
weeks of the study, participants performed SMR three times per week on non -consecutive days. 
During weeks three and four, participants were instructed to progress SMR protocol frequency to 
five days per week. They were also instructed to perform static stretching to bilateral SCM, UT, 
PM, and UCE muscles after SMR on three non -consecutive days per week. During the first two 
weeks of the study, subjects performed two repetitions of stretches held for 20 seconds, and 
progressed to three r epetitions of 30 seconds, five days per week during weeks three and four. At 
the conclusion of the training session, each group participant was emailed a copy of instructions 
for the assigned intervention. A weekly reminder email was sent to group members during the 4 -
week intervention period to encourage corrective exercise program (CEP) adherence. 
Participants were asked not to begin a new exercise program other than their assigned CEP or 
alter their current physical activity level during the 4 -week inter vention period.   
Self-Myofascial Release + Stretching  + Strengthen ing (SMRS S) Group . Immediately 
after baseline posture assessment, SMRSS group members received a 20 -minute in -person one -
on-one standardized instructional/training session provided by a research team member in the 
laboratory that included the same SMR + stret ching protocol as the SMRS group, as well as 
incorporated strengthening exercises following NASM recommendations for activation and 
integration techniques (Fahmy  2022). Group participants received a 12 x 6 x 6 inch high -density 
myofascial roller (NASM Too l, Cygnet Systems, Dallas, TX), a 23 -inch soft -tissue mobilization 
tool (Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s Choice® Pressure Point Hook Cane, Tampa, FL), a 36 inch medium resistance 
(resistance = 20 lb.) exercise tube with handles (Stroops, model: Slastix Toner, Clearfield, UT),  
and a 36 -inch medium resistance (resistance = 3.7 -5.5 lbs.) exercise band (Theraband, Akron, 
OH) at no cost to enable implementation of the prescribed 4 -week home program. Strengthening 
exercises included the supi[INVESTIGATOR_623021] (SCT), upper thoracic -lower c ervical extension 
(UTLCE), and a single -arm row with trunk rotation (SARTR). The SCT was performed 
progressed in three phases: Week 1: chin tuck held 2 seconds, 4 second return to start position, 
repeated five times. Week 2: same as week 1, but incorporate d a towel roll placed behind head to 
enable increased range of motion during the exercise. Week 3 and 4: chin tuck with head lift [ADDRESS_829626]; completing a single arm row with exercise tubing using the contralateral arm compared 
to the lead leg; rotating the trunk [ADDRESS_829627] the side of the body performing the row; 
followed by [CONTACT_623030] a controlled manner. 
This exercise was performed on both the right and left sides. The UTLCE and SARTR exercises 
were performed with 1 set of 10 repetitions for weeks 1 -2 and progressed to 2 sets of 10 
repetitions in weeks 3 -4 (Fahmy 2022) . Participants were asked to perform all muscle 
strengthening exercises three times per week on non -consecutive days throughout the 4 -week 
intervention period. At the conclusion of the tr aining session, each group participant was emailed 
a copy of instructions for the assigned intervention. A weekly reminder email was sent to group 
members during the 4 -week intervention period to encourage corrective exercise program (CEP) 
adherence. Parti cipants were asked not to begin a new exercise program other than their assigned 
CEP or alter their current physical activity level during the 4 -week intervention period.  
Control Group ( CG).  Immediately after baseline CVA assessment, participants 
randomly assigned to the CG we re informed they would not be receiving an intervention and 
were asked not to begin any new exercise program or alter their current physical activity level 
over the next four weeks.  
Questionnaire s and Follow -up Posture Assessment  
Two weeks into the study, participant s assigned to intervention groups completed a mid -
study questionnaire to assess intervention compliance. A fter the completion of [ADDRESS_829628] -study questionnaire 
to assess intervention compli ance and participants  in all grou ps were  asked to return to the 
Biomechanics laboratory to undergo a follow -up posture assessment . 
Statistical Analysis  
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 28 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, 
[LOCATION_003])  and reported with mean and standard deviation. Descriptive participant characteristics by 
[CONTACT_623031] a one -way ANOVA . Paired samples t-tests were used to assess within -
group differences in means between pre - and post -intervention CVA measures . Between -group 
comparisons of post -intervention mean CVA change were analyzed with a one -way ANOVA . 
Levene’s test was utilized to assess equality of error variance. Gabriel’s test was selected for 
post-hoc comparisons.  The significance level was set at p < 0.05.  
Results  
 The trial was completed by 72 participants ( 51 females, 21 males ) with a mean age: 20.17 
(SD: ± 2.25 years); mean height: 167.34 (SD: ± 8.25 cm); and mean weight: 70.31 (SD: ± 14.61 
kg). All participants reported SOC self -rating ≥ 3/5. Pre-intervention analysis revealed no 
significant difference ( p > 0.05) in participant age or anthropometric characteristics between 
groups . No significant between -group differences ( p > 0.05) in baseline CVA were present . 
Within -group comparisons of pre - vs post -intervention CVA outcomes revealed a significantly 
(p < 0.05) greater post -intervention CVA in the PE, SMRS, SMRSS, and CG . Post-hoc 
comparisons indicated p ost-intervention mean CVA change in the SMRS group: 3.8 (SD: ± 3.3 
deg.); and the SMRSS group: 4.4 (SD: ± 3.1 deg.); was significantly greater ( p < 0.0 1) than the 
CG: 0.8 (SD: ± 1.7 deg.) . All participants in the SMRS and SMRSS groups reported intervention 
adherence as moderate ly consisten t (50-75% sessions performed ) or higher  on both the mid - and 
post-study questionnaire. 91% of the PE group reported  intervention  adherence as moderate ly 
consisten t (50-75% adherence to guidelines) or higher  on the mid -study questionnaire . 96% of 
the PE group reported  intervention  adherence as moderate ly consisten t or higher  on the post-
study questionnaire .

Abstract:  
 
I. Abstract  
Adequate levels of vitamin D are essential for bone health at all ages but low levels of vitamin D 
may a lso negatively impact other aspects of health such as blood pressure.  We have previously 
shown that adults with African ancestry living near the equator have much higher levels of vitamin D 
and higher levels of blood pressure compared to adults with Afric an ancestry living in the Chicago 
area.  Multiple clinical trials have examined vitamin D supplementation for reducing blood pressure 
levels but very few studies have focused on adults with African ancestry and low vitamin D 
levels .  In addition, most prev ious clinical trials have not addressed calcium intake. While vitamin D 
may modulate blood pressure via its actions on activation of the renin angiotensin system, it is also 
possible that vitamin D mediates blood pressure via its effects on gastrointestina l calcium 
absorption.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_9962] a one arm study which will assess the safety and feasibility of 
supplementing 15 young adults with African ancestry and low vitamin D levels with 5,000 IU of 
Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) combined with [ADDRESS_339241] previous participants of the Modeling the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_277866]/Vitamin D 
Ancillary Study by [CONTACT_277875] d letters.  At baseline, all participants will have b lood pressure 
measured and a fasting serum and 24-hour urine specimen will be collected for measurement of 
calcium, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D  levels and urinary calcium excretion.   Repeat visits 
will be completed at [ADDRESS_339242] previously demonstrated 
significantly higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] in Africans living near the equator. 1, [ADDRESS_339243], total 25(OH) D inadequacy is approximately [ADDRESS_339244] 
clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation for cardiovascular risk factors  are not focused on 
individuals with 25(OH)D deficiency or insufficiency and do not address calcium intake.[ADDRESS_339245] demonstrated  a high 
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and low calcium intake.  In this popu lation, the association of 
serum 25(OH)D levels  with blood pressure show s a plateau effect with higher blood pressures 
limited to adults with 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/ml. These findings are consistent with observational 
studies examining the association of 25(OH)D levels with mortality.10-12   
3 
  
As discussed by [CONTACT_120845], 25(OH)D levels > 20 ng/ml are likely sufficient for the 
majority of U.S. adults , especially if calcium intake is adequate  because the main physiologic action of 
vitamin D is to increase absorption of dietary calcium.[ADDRESS_339246] demonstrated that 
calcium supplementation modestly reduces both systolic  (SBP)  and diastolic blood pressure  (DBP) , 
especially for a dults less than [ADDRESS_339247] trials showing no association between vitamin D 
supplementation and blood pressure change.14  Forman et al completed a 4-arm d ouble blind placebo 
controlled 3-month trial of 1000 , 2000, or  4000 IU of vitamin  D3 per day  vs. placebo  in African -
Americans with a median age of 51 years .  The dif ference in SBP  between baseline and 12 weeks  was 
1.7 mmHg for the placebo group, -0.66 mmHg  for the 1000 IU/d group , -3.4 mmHg for the 2000 IU/day 
group, and -4.0 mmHg for the 4000 IU/day group. Each 1 ng/ml increase in plasma 25(OH)D  was 
associated with a 0.2 mmHg decline in  SBP levels  (P=0.02)  if baseline 25(OH)D level was < 20 ng/ml . 
It shoul d be noted that in this trial, all participants were given 200 mg of calcium daily  and baseline 
calcium intake was not assessed .    
 
The other limiting factor for previous clinical trials of vitamin D for blood pressure lowering is the use 
of total 25(OH)D  as the only measure of vitamin D status. Clinically, 25(OH)D remains the key 
biomarker of vitamin D status in  part because 25(OH)D has a substantially longer half -life than the 
active form of vitamin D called 1, 25 -dihyroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), and becau se 25(OH]D reflects 
total vitamin D stores obtained from cutaneous synthesis or via foods and supplements.15 However, 
total 25[OH]D may not be the optimal measure of vitamin D required for good health , especially if total 
25(OH)D levels are low .9 Over  90% of total 25(OH)D is tightly bound to vitamin D binding protein (DBP) 
with approximately 1% circulating free. This fr action of 25(OH)D not bound to DBP  shows stronger 
associations with bone density and serum calc ium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels compared to 
total 25(OH) D.16-18 Thus, fre e 25(OH)D  may be a more clinically useful marker of vitamin D status . We 
hypothesize that a negative association exists with both 25(OH)D and free 25(OH)D and blood 
pressure  in young U.S. blacks with 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/ml and calcium intake < 1000 mg/d ay. We 
further hypothesize that  supplementation with both vitamin D 3 and calcium reduces blood pressure 
levels  and incr eases both 25(OH)D and free 25(OH)D .   
 
III. Study Aims  
 
a. Recruit 15  black U.S. adults ages 25 -45 years of age with 25(OH)D levels <  20 ng/ml , estimated 
calcium intake < 1000 mg/day  and no use of anti -hypertensive medications  and a resting sea ted 
systolic blood pressure ≥ 120  mmHg .  Measure baseline levels of total 25(OH)D  free vitamin 
25(OH)D, active vitamin D [1,25(OH)D], parathyroid  hormone , serum calcium  levels , 24-hour 
calcium excretion  and estimate calcium intake using an interactive calcium calculator .  
b. Supplement study participants with 5000 IU vitamin D3 with 1000 mg elemental calcium daily for 
12 weks  and measure  changes in blood pressure , total 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2D and free 
25(OH)D, PTH, serum calcium and [ADDRESS_339248] pi[INVESTIGATOR_277867] a larger trial to determine whether 
vitamin D combined with calcium lowers blood pressure in young black adults with low 25(OH)D lev els  
IV. Administrative Organization  
Participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_277876].  We will also contact [CONTACT_277877][INVESTIGATOR_277868]/Vitamin D Ancillary Study.  Contact [CONTACT_277878].  The study will be limited to Loyola only and study recruitment will not 
include any other universities or medical centers.  Data will be collected by [CONTACT_277879] a secure password protected Loyola server.  Data will be kept in RedCap  on a secure and 
[ADDRESS_339249] access to the RedCap data.  
Participants will provide written informed consent to participate in the screeni ng visit  and study .  We will 
also ask participants to provide written informed consent to participate in Loyola’s biobank repository.  During 
the screening visit, [ADDRESS_339250]  Diagnostics (Quest) .  A blood pregnancy test will be done in all women  at the 
screening exam  and the pre gnancy test will be completed by [CONTACT_277880] .  We will ask participants to provide written 
informed consent for their blood and urine specimens to be placed in a biorepository  for future studies .   To 
reduce participant burden and cost, we will also bank 5 ml of serum obtained at the screening visit to measur e 
25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2D  at Quest only if the participant  is determined to be eligible for the BBC and Vitamin 
D study and enrolls .  We will discard all banked specimens if the participants are not eligible to enroll in the 
BBC and Vitamin D study  unless the participant provided consent to participate in the bio repository  
Participants may opt to not enroll in the biorepository regardless of eligibility for the BBC and Vitamin D study.  
A separate consent form will be used to obtain written informed consent for the biorepository.   
For participants who do enroll i n the BBC and Vitamin D study, a serum specimen (15 ml) will be 
collected at the 6 –week follow -up visit to measure serum calcium and 25(OH)D.  Serum calcium and 25(OH)D 
will be measured at the  Quest lab.  
 At the 12 week visit, 15 ml of blood will be obt ained to again measure 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2D and PTH 
levels and serum calcium.  Vitamin D measures , serum calc ium and PTH will be measured by [CONTACT_277880] .  
Participants will also be asked to collect a [ADDRESS_339251] of 15 adults ages 25 -45 years with  self-reported African American 
race/ethnicity.  The study will be conducted during a 4 month window to eliminate the seasonal effects on 
vitamin D levels.  All participants will provide written informed consent after study investigators ensure that 
potent ial participants meet all eligibility criteria outlined below.

d. Study outcomes/endpoints:  
a. Blood pressure  
Seated blood pressure and pulse are measured at the screening visit, enrollment visit and at [ADDRESS_339255] period using an automated 
device (Omron).  Arm circumference will be meas ured using a standard flexible tape measure.  The cuff 
size will be determined based on arm circumference.  Participants will be instructed to not smoke for [ADDRESS_339256] for 4 hours prior to the exam.  Participants will be instructed to 
empty their bladder prior to the exam.  Participants will be seated for 5 minutes prior to blood pressure 
measurement. Blood pressure will be measured three times in one minute intervals  using an Omron 
6 
 automatic device with the study staff not in the room.  The average of these three recordings will be 
recorded as the mean blood pressure.   
b. Total 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2D levels   
Total 25[OH]D and 1,25[OH] 2D: Total 25[OH]D and 1,25[OH] 2D will be measured with the use of liquid 
chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) (inter -assay coefficient of variation for 
25[OH]D3 = 4.8% and for 1,25[OH] 2D = 8.8%). The assay will measure total 25[OH] D, including 
25[OH]D3 and 25[OH]D2, calibrated to standards provided by [CONTACT_277881].20  We will provide all potential participants who are screened or enrolled with the result s of 
their vitamin D results.   For screening purposes, 25(OH)D will be measured in specimens collected at 
the screening visit and testing will be done by [CONTACT_277880] .  Then 25(OH)D will be measured at  Quest in 
banked specimens from the screening visit and from visits 6 and 12 weeks after the enrollment visit.  
1,25(OH)2D will be measured in banked specimens obtained at the screening visit and in blood 
specimens obtained at the visit 12 weeks after enrollment.  
 
c. Free 25(OH)D  
Free 25(OH)D levels -will be measured u sing kits from  Quest .  The free 25(OH)D ELISA is based on a 
two-step immunoassay procedure performed in a microtiter plate. During the first incubation step, free 
25(OH)D  (including both 25(OH)D2 and D3) is bound to the antivitamin D antibody coated on the wall 
of the microtiter plate. The in vivo equilibrium between free and bound 25(OH)D is minimally disturbed.  
After washing, a  fixed amount of biotinylated 2 5(OH)D is ad ded to each well.  The nonbound 
biotinylated 25(OH)D is removed by [CONTACT_14390], and a streptavidin peroxidase conjugate is added.  In a 
next step, a 3’, 5, 5’ -tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic substrate is added. Finally, the reaction is 
stopped by [CONTACT_277882] a stop reagent and the absorbance (A450 nm) is measured using a plate 
spectrophotometer.  The concentration of free vitamin D in the sample is inversely proportional to the 
absorbance in each sample well.  Free vitamin D will be measured in banked spec imens obtained at 
the screening visit and in blood specimens obtained at 12 weeks after enrollment . 
 
d. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels  
Intact PTH levels will be measured with the use of the Elecsys Parathyroid Hormone Immunoassay 
(Modular Analytics E170, Ro che Diagnostics) (inter -assay coefficient of variation, 2.5%). PTH levels will 
be measured  by [CONTACT_277880] .  PTH levels will be measured in banked specimens obtained at the screening 
visit and in blood specimens obtained at the  visit [ADDRESS_339257] . Creatinine will be measured in serum collected at the screening visit. Serum 
calcium will be measured from specimens c ollected at the screening visit and at 6 and 12 weeks of 
follow -up after starting the enrollment visit.  
 
f. Calcium intake -calcium intake will be estimated at baseline only using an online interactive calcium 
calculator from the International Osteoporosis Fou ndation  http://www.iofbonehealth.org/calcium  
VI. Study Procedures  
a. Sampling plan  
Individuals who are known to have low vitamin D levels due to their  enrollment in the Modeling the 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_277866]/Vitamin D Ancillary Study (METS/VIDA) will be  asked to participate in a screening 
visit.  Thus , we anticipate that at least 25 % of recruited participants will meet study eligibility.  We will 
provide a sm all incentive to participants cover travel and time spent at the clinic. Participants will be 
paid $50 for each completed visit including the screening visit so the maximum amount a participant 
could be paid is $200 for completing all four visits.  We will  also provide parking passes for each clinic.  
 
7 
 b. Recruitment procedures  
We will recruit potential participants by [CONTACT_277883]/VIDA participants with low vitamin D 
levels via phone. We will also place flyers in clinics and will provide flyers to family practice physicians, 
internal medicine physicians and endocrinologists at Loyola outpatient clinics.  We will also work with 
the Loyola marketing team to market the study.   
 
c. Screening procedures  
Screening visits will occur  in the CTRE clinic on the  lst floor  and written informed consent for the 
screening visit  and study  will be obtained by [CONTACT_277884] .  At the screening visit, 
participants will provide written informed consent.  Participants will also be asked to provide written 
informed consent f or their serum and urine specimens to be placed in a biorepository for future studies. 
Participating in the biorepository is optional and will not affect their  ability to  participate in the screening 
exam or their overall eligibility to participate in the BBC and Vitamin D study.  The screening visit will 
take ninety minutes  to complete .  Potential participants will be instructed to fast for at least four hours 
prior to the  screening exam.  All laboratory tests taken during the screening visit will be for research 
purposes and will not be part of standard care.  During a screening visit, a research investigator will 
review the past medical history and any medication use to e nsure the participant meets all inclusion 
and exclusion criteria.  Resting blood pressure will be taken per protocol and height and weight will be 
measured. A fasting blood sample  (15 ml)  will be collected from the potential participant.  Blood will be 
sent to Quest  for measurement of serum creatinine and calcium  and vitamin D.  Participants will be 
asked to collect a [ADDRESS_339258] .  We anticipate that we will need to screen 60 adults to identify 15 individuals who 
are eligible for the study.  Data collected from any individual who is found not be eligible for the study 
will be kept in a secure database (REDCAP) on a secure Loyola drive.  For participants who do not 
enroll in the BBC and Vitamin D study, all banked specimens will be discarded unless they provided 
written informed consent to participate in Loyola’s biorepository.  
 
 
Once the lab values for the potential participant have been reported  to the investigators, then study 
eligibility may be determined.  Individuals will be contact[CONTACT_277885] .  For those individuals who are eligible to participate in the study, an enrollment visit will 
be scheduled within 28 days of  the screening visit.  The enrollment visit and all subsequent visits will be 
held at Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Campus in the CTRE clinic .  In order to reduce 
participant burden, we will bank serum specimens from the screening visit.  For those participants who 
provide written informed consent to enroll in the BBC and Vitamin D study, we will use this banked 
serum to measure 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2D using an LC/MS method at  Quest .  During the enrollment 
visit, participants will receive educat ion about the study and the potential risks of participating  and will 
provide written informed consent .  The Loyola pharma cy will dispense the cholecalciferol and the 
calcium citrate to the enrolled participants .   
 
Participants will then return at [ADDRESS_339259] four hours before the next visits.  At the 6 and 12 week visit, a fasting blood 
specimen  (15 ml)  will be collected.  Study staff will query participants about adverse e ffects and 
symptoms of vitamin D intoxication.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_277869] [ADDRESS_339260] their urine for 24 hours at the 12 week visit for measurement of urinary calcium 
excretion.

e.  Optional Biobanking.   Participants may optionally  agree to reposit blood  and urine samples  into 
CRO -BIOREP (LU# 204853) for future research purposes.  Participants will sign a second informed 
consent document should t hey agree to reposit their samples .  The research team members and 
Biorepository staff will each retain a copy of the signed repo sitory informed consent document.  It is 
important to point out that participants do no t need to agree to reposit samples  in order to participate in 
the study.  
  All patients who agree to reposit  specimens into CRO -BIOREP (LU# 204853) will be assigned a  
  unique code using the SMART -ID system. This number will be used to connect coded specimens and  
  coded data to other studies conducted by [CONTACT_277886].  
  To receive this number, we will ask participants for  sex at birth, month of birth, day of birth, year of birth,  
  and social security number.  This information is entered into a secure website where it is hashed into a  
  unique ID using a java script.  The participant and research team will receive the uni que ID number.  
  Once the number is created, the information that was entered is immediately deleted.  This means the  
  website will not retain any of the information that is entered to create the SMART -ID.  However, should  
  anyone need to retrieve a SMA RT-ID number, you will be able to get it again at a later date by [CONTACT_277887] (i.e., sex, date of birth, and social security number) that  
          was entered before.  
 
  
Freezerworks, the biospecimen tracking software used in the repository, will also automatically assign 
specimen numbers to incoming specimens. These numbers will identify all donated specimens.  The list 
that links these codes with patients’ identifying information will  be kept separat e from all research 
specimens and clinical data. Information that may readily identify patients will never  be shared with 
anyone.  
 
Blood and urine samples will be stored according to the Clinical Research Office Biobank protocols at

reported to the Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Institutional Review Board.  The dose of vitam in D3 
11 
 (5,000IU) is 1000 IU lower than the recommended dose for treating adults with 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/ml.21  
We will also exclude individuals with calcium intake that is at or above the current recommended daily calcium 
intake (1000 mg).   
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_277872] a serum calcium levels ≥ 10.6 meq/L and/or a 25(OH)D level ≥ 80 ng/ml or 
sympto ms of vitamin D intoxication (e.g. bone pain, nausea or vomiting) will stop treatment but they will 
continue to be monitored in the study through week 12 when serum calcium and 25(OH)D levels will be 
measured at the end of the study.  The study will contin ue until participants have been followed for 12 weeks .     
VIII. Analysis Plan  
This feasibility study will examine multiple aspects of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_277873] p ersons 
enroll ed vs. number of total persons identified as eligible.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] c ounts will be done at the 6 and 12 week visit to 
assess compliance with vitamin D and calcium supplementation.  The percentage of participants taking 80% or 
more of the vitamin D3 supplement and the calcium supplement will be determined.  The number of  
participant s reporting  symptoms and all adverse events will be quantified.   Repeated measures analysis of 
variance models will be used to assess change in the outcome measures including systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, vitamin D measures, parathyroid ho rmone levels and 24-hour urine calcium excretion values.

Background: Enhanced recovery  after surgery (ERAS) involves changes to multiple  aspects of 
perioperative care with the aim of standardizing postoperative patient care, improving  patient  
outcomes, reducing  postoperative  length  of stay,  and optimizing patient satisfaction.  Enhanced 
recovery pathways have  been widely implemented in many  different areas  of surgery.  Initially,  
these pathways  were introduced in colorectal surgery nearly [ADDRESS_188897]  in the United  Kingdom.  In that study the 
investigators were able to successfully introduce an enhanced recovery  program to their 
obstetrics unit and noted a greater proportion of patients discharged  earlier with improved 
patient satisfaction, without a concomitant  increase  in readmission rates.2

postoperative recovery process, thereby  [CONTACT_162774][INVESTIGATOR_110756].
Hypothesis: We hypothesize  that an enhanced recovery program at the time of cesarean birth 
in obstetrics will promote  early ambulation, resumption of diet and initiation of breastfeeding, 
and reduce postoperative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_162766].
Currently, patients are encouraged to ambulate on the first post-operative day, but it is largely 
left up to the patient when  to actually begin  to ambulate.  They are similarly offered a diet on the 
first postoperative day but are not encouraged to eat.  Breastfeeding is more  systematically 
encouraged early as part of Montefiore’s effort to get baby [CONTACT_162775].  And finally, 
patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_162767].
IRB NUMBER: 2016-6966

Version 3 – 12FEB2017 IRB #2016-[ADDRESS_188899] of care.
Null hypothesis: An enhanced recovery program at the time of cesarean birth will have no 
impact on postoperative  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_162766] (our primary outcome variable).
Objective: To determine whether women randomized  to an enhanced  recovery  program will 
have improved postoperative outcomes, improved  breastfeeding initiation and continuation, 
reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_162768]. 
Materials and Methods:  This will be a prospective non-blinded randomized controlled  study  of 
women presenting  for care to the Montefiore Medical Center. All patients will undergo  routine  
obstetrical care and preparation for cesarean  birth as if they were not participating in the 
research study.  Women participating in the study  will be greater than 37 0/[ADDRESS_188900] menstrual period or early ultrasound. 
The women participating in the study  will be undergoing either: 1. Scheduled cesarean birth or 
2. Non-emergent cesarean birth.  Non-emergent  cesarean birth will be defined  as an indicated  
cesarean birth based on obstetrical criteria without significant fetal heart tracing abnormalities. 
This would include  women diagnosed with a labor  dystocia or arrest of labor, failed labor 
induction, fetal malpresentation in labor  (i.e. breech presentation) or any other non-emergent 
indication for cesarean birth in which there  is no immediate danger to mother or fetus. Patient 
consent will occur  on admission to the obstetrical labor and delivery  unit for elective cesarean 
births. Because patients presenting to our units may be in pain and pain may compromise 
cognition and judgment, at the time of actual enrollment, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_162769]. If at the time they are 
approached for actual  involvement in the protocol, they are in too much pain to have the 
informed consent  discussion and provide consent,  they will not be considered for participation. 
Women that accept participation will be randomly assigned to an enhanced recovery program  or 
routine perioperative care. Using a random  sequence number table, we will generate block  
randomization. Allocations will be placed  in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes.
Postoperative recovery will follow the usual service protocols as if the patient were not in the 
study with the exception  of components of the enhanced  recovery  protocol, which will include 
several evidence  based recommendations (see Enhanced Recovery  Protocol components, 
below) including early ambulation, early diet initiation, early  removal of urinary catheter, early 
removal of postoperative  dressing and standing  ketorolac for 24 hours postoperatively.
Maternal demographics  to be obtained  will include body mass index (BMI), gestational age, pre-
operative and post-operative day #[ADDRESS_188901]. The

Sites: Montefiore Medical Center (Both Weiler and Wakefield on their labor  floors)
Study size and Power: Patients are routinely discharged on postoperative day number 3 or 
approximately 72 hours postoperatively  at Montefiore Medical Center following cesarean birth. 
Our primary  outcome variable will be postoperative length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  Patients in the 
routine perioperative care group and the enhanced recovery protocol group will be offered the 
opportunity to be discharged on postoperative day number 2 or approximately  48 hours 
postoperatively at the discretion of the obstetric attending physician. Our experience is that no 
more than 10% of patients are discharged home on postoperative  day number [ADDRESS_188907] calculated that if we anticipate  an 
increase in the rate of early discharges  on postoperative day number 2 from 10% to 30% with

Version 3 – 12FEB2017 IRB #2016-[ADDRESS_188908]  will require 59 subjects in each group,  and 118 total 
participants,  with an alpha error of 0.05 and a power of 80%.  Patients in the control group will 
continue to be offered  Ketorolac for postoperative analgesia which  is considered standard of 
care in our institution. Approximately [ADDRESS_188909]  to our primary outcome measure which is postoperative length 
of stay. As a result, our power calculation would  therefore still remain  valid for our primary 
outcome measure.
Risks/Benefits:
 
Ketorolac tromethamine, including Toradol can cause peptic ulcers,  gastrointestinal bleeding  
and/or perforation of the stomach  or intestines,  which can be fatal. These events can occur at 
any time during  use and without warning symptoms. Ketorolac  is contraindicated in patients with 
active peptic ulcer  disease, in patients  with recent gastrointestinal  bleeding  or perforation,  and in 
patients with a history  of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. NSAIDs  may cause 
an increased risk of serious  cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke,  
which can be fatal. This risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with cardiovascular 
disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease  may be at greater risk Ketorolac  is 
contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery by[CONTACT_101874]. Ketorolac is contraindicated  in patients with advanced renal impairment and in 
patients at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion. Toradol inhibits platelet function and is, 
therefore, contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, 
patients with hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete  hemostasis  and those at high risk of bleeding  
 
Limited data from one published  study involving [ADDRESS_188910] milk. Levels  were  undetectable (less than 5 ng/mL) in 4 
of the patients.  After  a single administration of 10 mg of Ketorolac, the maximum milk 
concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL, and the maximum  milk-to-plasma  ratio was 0.037. After 
1 day of dosing (10 mg every 6 hours), the maximum milk concentration was 7.9 ng/mL, and the 
maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025.  Assuming a daily intake of 400-1,000  mL of human 
milk per day and a maternal body  weight of 60 kg, the calculated maximum daily infant 
exposure was 0.[ZIP_CODE]  mg/kg/day, which is 0.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. 
Exercise caution when  ketorolac is administered  to a nursing woman. Available information has 
not shown any specific adverse events in nursing infants; however, instruct patients to contact 
[CONTACT_162778]'s  health  care provider if they note any adverse events. The American  academy of 
pediatrics has found ketorolac to be compatible with breastfeeding.
There are no known  risks to this study  beyond that of routine postoperative care at the time of 
cesarean birth in addition  to the aforementioned use of Ketorolac. All patient information  will be 
kept confidential. Patient research records will be kept confidential and names  will not be used 
in any written or verbal  reports. The patient’s  information will be given a code  number and 
separated from your name [CONTACT_162782].  All information will 
be kept in a secure manner and computer records will be password protected.  Study  information  
will be kept as long as they are useful for the completion of the research study after which they 
will be destroyed.

benefit of participation in this study  will generate important information about  improving  
postoperative recovery at cesarean birth.
Data Management:  Data collected in this study protocol will be extracted from the secure 
password protected computer programs utilized by [CONTACT_162779]: Epic / 
ASOBGYN/ EPFweb. Information  extracted for study use will be maintained on a password 
protected computer  in a locked office  and not accessible to others.  Once the clinical information  
obtained on a patient is completed the information will be de-identified. Patient  confidentiality 
will be maintained at all times.
Statistics: To achieve  comparable groups we will randomize enrollees to one of two treatment 
arms. Randomization will be done  with block sizes of [ADDRESS_188912] of care 
postoperative recovery interventions. The primary analysis  will be a chi-square comparison of 
proportions of the 2 x 2 table of study arm (experimental/control) and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_162766] 
(shortened length  of stay/standard length of stay). We will also assess  an odds ratio (with 95% 
confidence interval) for additional  outcome measures: Postoperative pain medication 
requirements, Breastfeeding initiation and continuation  rates and patient satisfaction will be 
determined by a follow-up survey performed greater than 4 weeks  postoperatively.
Data safety monitoring Plan (DSMP): In order to maintain additional patient safety, a DSMP 
will be in place for the study. The data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_162780], namely [CONTACT_162783] and [CONTACT_162784]. In addition,  a statistician who is 
not part of the study will review the data, [CONTACT_162785]. The Data  safety monitoring 
committee will meet every  [ADDRESS_188913] for review 
and action.

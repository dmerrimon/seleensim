ROSTERS Protocol 1-5 
Chapter 1, Page 5 Version 1.0 3/5/13 1.1 STUDY AIMS 
1.1.1 Aim 1: 
To test the hypothesis that P GY2&3 residents working on an SCS intervention schedule  will 
make significantly fewer harmful medical erro rs (preventable adve rse events) and other 
serious medical errors (near misses) while carin g for ICU patients than residents working on a 
traditional schedule ; (primary endpoints: resident-rel ated preventable adverse events and 
near misses)  
 
1.1.2 Aim 2:  
To test the hypothesis that rates of harmful me dical errors (preventab le adverse events) and 
other serious medical errors (near misses) throughout the ICU (i.e., those involving and those 
not involving residents) will be lower in ICUs when PGY2&3 residents work on an SCS 
intervention schedule  than when residents work on a traditional schedule; (major secondary 
endpoints: ICU-wide preventable adverse events and near misses)  
 
1.1.3 Aim 3: 
To test the hypothesis that resident physicians’ risk of neurobehavioral performance failures 
and motor vehicle crashes – as  assessed through simple visu al reaction time tasks [Johns 
Drowsiness Score (JDS) and Psyc homotor Vigilance Task (PVT) lapses] – will be lower on 
the SCS intervention schedule  than on the traditional schedule. (maj or secondary endpoints: 
resident neurobehavioral performa nce and predicted driving safety)  
 
1.[ADDRESS_683033]-year residents (interns; PGY1s) worki ng recurrent extended duration shifts (>24 hours) 
make more serious medical er rors than do those working sh ifts of <16 consecutive hours; 
moreover, PGY1s working extended duration shifts  suffer more injuries on the job, and have 
an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) on the drive home from work.(1-8) In 
2009, after a year-long comprehensiv e study, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that 
while it remained unclear whether resident sl eep deprivation led to patient harm, “the 
scientific evidence base establishes that hum an performance begins to deteriorate after 16 
hours of wakefulness.”(9;10) They consequently  called for the elimination of all resident 
physician shifts without sleep  over 16 consecutive hours. 
 In response, beginning in July 2011, the Accreditation C ouncil for Graduate Medical 
Education (ACGME) limited interns to no more  than 16 consecutive hours of work; second 
year (PGY2) and higher residents, however, will  continue to work for up to 28 consecutive 
hours.(11) In choosing not to more substantivel y limit the hours of PGY2 and higher residents 
ROSTERS Protocol 1-6 
Chapter 1, Page 6 Version 1.0 3/5/13 – who represent approximately 80% of all physic ians-in-training – the ACGME indicated that 
in its view, insufficient data existed to s upport policy change for mo re senior trainees. 
 In this study, we seek to conclusively addre ss two knowledge gaps: 1) th e lack of data on the 
relationship between PGY2 and higher sleep depriv ation and patient safety ; and 2) the lack of 
data on the relationship between resident sleep deprivation and preventable patient injuries. 
 
1.3 STUDY DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS 
 
The study is a clustered randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of eliminating 
residents’ traditional 24-hour shifts in ICUs. The tr ial will take place in 6 academic medical centers 
nationwide, in three waves of two centers each.(Figure 1) One of each pair of units will initially be 
randomly assigned to the traditiona l schedule (i.e., in wh ich overnight shifts of 24-28 hours continue 
to occur every 4 nights), or to th e SCS intervention schedule (i.e., in which residents are limited to 
16 consecutive work hours; sleep be fore night duty is promoted; and time off is arranged to allow 
recovery from sleep debt.) 
Our planned timeline will be as follows: after a [ADDRESS_683034] 1; the traditional schedule will continue in the other PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890].  There will be a 4-
month wash-in period, after which ti me [ADDRESS_683035] in intervention 
(in black, Figure 1) and traditional (in blue) ICUs. After 8 months of  data collection, the units will 
cross over (traditional to intervention schedule; intervention to traditional). Following another 4-
month wash-in period, there will be 8 additional mont hs of data collection. Study sites in waves two 
and three will follow the same pattern. Of note, each  intervention period will be scheduled to occur 
entirely within a single academic year, and will  be preceded or followed (12 months apart) by a 
control period that will also occur entirely within an academic year.

ROSTERS Protocol 1-7 
Chapter 1, Page 7 Version 1.0 3/5/[ADDRESS_683036] 21 years of age. Four to eight residents will 
be recruited per month at each clinical center for total of approximately 50 residents per site and approximately 300 subjects study-wide.  
1.4.1 Recruitment 
Sites will submit a waiver of informed consent for the collection of patient data, but will 
obtain residents’ written informed consent to ob serve them, and collect resident-specific data. 
Working with program directors at each hosp ital, the Principal Investigators will make 
presentations each year to all residents to describe our study and request volunteer 
participants. Residents are free not to participate in the study; if they choose not to participate, 
they will not be followed by [CONTACT_526351], but the unit schedule will proceed on the traditional or SCS intervention schedule  as planned. 
1.4.2 Randomization 
The intervention will be implemented in one rand omly assigned study site in each of the three 
waves and the second site will remain on the traditional schedule. After 8 months of data collection, the units will cross over (traditional to intervention schedul e; intervention to traditional). 
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will be responsi ble for randomly assigning sites to their initial 
study arm.  
1.4.[ADDRESS_683037] in pediat ric intensive care units (PI[INVESTIGATOR_174927]). In general, subjects will 
continue to carry out their normal activities and responsibili ties when working either the 
intervention or traditional schedule. Throughout the PI[INVESTIGATOR_526317], subjects will complete a 
daily sleep diary; will wear act iwatches, described further below, to validate the results of 
self-reported sleep; and will wear Optalert gl asses on the commute to and from work.  They 
will also periodically complete psychomotor vigila nce tests (PVTs) to monitor their vigilance.  
At the completion of their rotations, all subjects  will complete an End of Rotation survey. For 
every experimental intervention, there will be writ ten protocols and checklists used to insure 
uniformity in the execution of standard procedures. 
ROSTERS Protocol 1-8 
Chapter 1, Page 8 Version 1.0 3/5/13 1.5.1 Detection of Errors and Adverse Events 
We will use a very intensive, four-pronged data collection approach to comprehensively 
measure rates of all errors and adverse events.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Continuous Observation  
A team of five physician research associates  will conduct direct observation of resident 
subjects working in the units, [ADDRESS_683038] additional information. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Voluntary and solicited reports 
Forms will be made available and prominently posted in the ICUs to facilitate voluntary 
reporting of possible errors and events by [CONTACT_526352]. Chart reviewers will also request reports from staff of errors a nd adverse events [ADDRESS_683039] additional information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of formal incident reports 
In each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], formal incident reports will be collected if permitted; if any institutions will 
not allow access to these data, we  will request that dupl icate study reports be filed by [CONTACT_526353]. In addition, in any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_526318], the computerized AE monitors will also be 
interrogated for study-unit events. Nurse data extractors will collect additional information on 
each incident identified. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Chart surveillance 
The nurse data extractors will serve as the focal  point for data collection and organization, and 
will follow up and review all data collected by [CONTACT_255483], reported by [CONTACT_3655], and detected via incident reporting systems. In addition to coordinating collection from other sources, 
reviewers will examine all orders and charts  5 days per week; a fo cused version of the 
Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Global  Trigger Tool (consisting of the intensive 
care module, cares module, and medication module triggers)(12) will be used to increase the 
sensitivity of adverse event detection. Review s on Monday will include a review of the 
weekend. Data collected for each incident will include a description and classification of the 
event, patient information, services and pers onnel involved, and additional work resulting 
from the event. Medication incidents will furt her include name, dose, route and category of 
the drug involved. 
ROSTERS Protocol 1-9 
Chapter 1, Page 9 Version 1.0 3/5/13 1.5.2 Classification by [CONTACT_926], a ttribution, and preventability 
Physician observers and research nurses will id entify suspected errors and adverse events. 
Two independent physician reviewers will subseque ntly classify events as errors, potential 
adverse events (near misses), or adverse events. All events will be rated on severity using the modified NCC-MERP scale.(12;13) Preventability  will be rated using a four point Likert 
scale. Disagreements will be resolved by [CONTACT_526354]. Events for which consensus cannot be 
reached will be re-rated by a third reviewer. Pre-discussion inter-rater reliability will be evaluated with the Kappa statistic.   
1.5.[ADDRESS_683040] ized illness severity score, such as PRISM.(14) 
Morbidity and disability data will be collected unti l discharge for all patients with an adverse event, 
as will data about the complexity of conditions, interventions, and drug regimens, including number 
and types of drugs and interventions. 
1.5.[ADDRESS_683041] data on resident s’ sleep and work hours 
using the methods described below.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sleep and work logs 
A diary of sleep and wake times will be maintained by [CONTACT_526355]. A post-sleep 
questionnaire will be completed immediately fo llowing wake time from all sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_526319], duration, consolidation, 
quality, and wakefulness during sl eep, as well as daily work hour s. Our sleep and work logs 
have previously been validated; hours of sl eep and work reported using this methodology 
have a high correlation with pol ysomnographically-validated total sleep time (r=0.94) as well 
as 3
rd-party documented work hours (r=0.98).(2) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ambulatory physiologic monitoring 
To further validate reported sleep times in th is study, wrist activity an d ambient light levels 
will be monitored for the entire duration of re sidents’ rotations with a solid-state, portable 
data collection device (Moti onlogger BASIC; Ambulatory M onitoring, Inc., Ardsley, NY). 
The Motionlogger recorder is a small wrist worn device that measures activity and ambient 
light exposure; it is waterproof and power ed by a 3V, 150 mAmp-hr Lithium Manganese 
battery that has a lifetime of 60 days. Data  are preserved if the battery expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054].  
1.5.5 Measuring Resident Vigilance and Driving Safety 
[IP_ADDRESS] Optalert  
Optalert is an innovative technology that uses infrared oculography to 
monitor the alertness of an individua l continuously. The Optalert glasses 
contain a small light emitting diode (LED) positioned below and in front of the eye, attached to a frame de signed to hold clear or prescription 
lenses. (Figure 2)  Brief pulses of invisible infr ared (IR) light (each lasting 
 
Figure 2. Optalert 
glasses  
ROSTERS Protocol 1-10 
Chapter 1, Page 10 Version 1.0 3/5/13 70 μs, wavelength 935 nm) are directed up in a 30 de gree cone of light cen tered on the lower edge 
of the upper eyelid a nd repeated at a frequency of  500 Hz. The total IR light  reflected back from the 
eye and eyelid is detected by a phototra nsistor in the frame beside the LED.  
  A microprocessor, housed in the arm of the glasses,  controls the timing and other characteristics of 
the IR pulses, and digitizes the analogue output fr om the sensors. The power supply and the serial 
output from the glasses via a light cable connected  to a personal digital assistant (PDA). This PDA 
provides a variety of different an alyses of the recorded signals including reflecting position and the 
velocity of movements. The velocity of movements are calculated 500 times per second as the 
change in position (uncalibrated units) per 50 ms. The durations of the separate components of blinks and of other eye and eyelid movements, and their AVRs, are measured by [CONTACT_526356]-amplitude analysis of both the posit ion and velocity signals and classification of all 
periods and amplitudes per minute.   These analyses automatically generate an  alertness score (Johns Dr owsiness Scale, JDS), a 
composite measure of alertness based on many variables characterizi ng blinks, including the 
ratio of the amplitude to the maximum velocity  (AVR) of eyelid movements for closing and 
reopening of the eyelids, as well as the dura tion of eyelids closing, of remaining closed, and 
of reopening during blinks. The weighting for each variable in the JDS was derived from 
multiple regression analysis, comparing results of Optalert recordings before and after sleep deprivation. The JDS is calculated  each minute on a 0-10 scale. No rmal values are 0-4, and do 
not require adjustment fo r individual subjects.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PVT.  
In the proposed study, we will also have resident physician subjects complete Psychomotor 
Vigilance Testing – an established metric of vigi lance that is sensitive to sleep deprivation and 
circadian misalignment (15) – during one shift pe r week, every five hours.   Completing the PVT 
requires 10 minutes and provides da ta on vigilance that will be us ed to derive an independent 
measure of neurobehavioral performa nce while subjects are on the job. 
1.5.6 Additional Measures 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Self-reported attentional failures, motor ve hicle crashes (MVCs), and percutaneous 
injuries 
Through end-of-rotation surveys, we will also collect data on residents’ self-reported 
attentional failures, MVCs, near-miss MVCs, and percutaneous injuries using the instruments 
we previously developed for use in our national cohort study. Any reported MVCs and 
percutaneous injuries will be validated by [CONTACT_526357] (e.g. police reports, 
repair bills, etc. for MVCs), as was done in  our cohort study.(1;4) When MVCs occur on the 
commute to and from work, we will also have detailed Optalert data available. We believe 
that collecting MVC and percutaneous data is im portant given their implications for resident 
safety, but with 300 anticipated subjects in the study, and the re lative infrequency of these 
occupational injuries,(1;4) we will have power to detect an effect of the intervention on these outcomes only if they are reduced more than tw o-fold. As such, analysis of these outcomes 
will be considered exploratory. 
ROSTERS Protocol 1-11 
Chapter 1, Page 11 Version 1.0 3/5/13 [IP_ADDRESS] Educational Measures 
We will also, through the daily diaries and the en d-of-rotation survey, coll ect preliminary data 
on residents’ educational experiences. Residents will provide daily estimates on their logs of the amount of time spent in didactic educat ion and the amount of time spent reading for 
knowledge acquisition.  On their en d-of-rotation surveys, they will report their impressions of 
their educational experience. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of Salivary Samples for Subsequent Genetic Analyses 
In light of the emerging science exploring the gene tic predictors of susceptibility to sleep loss 
and circadian misalignment, salivary samples will be collected to measure genetic modifiers of the SCS intervention’s effects. Unfortunately, the limited number of subjects (~300) being 
studied in this proposed trial precludes c onducting genome-wide a ssociation studies to 
determine what genes may convey an increased ri sk of fatigue-related error, and as yet, no 
candidate gene has been independently verifi ed to convey altered vulnerability to the 
performance-impairment associat ed with sleep depriv ation. However, gi ven that this study 
will gather unprecedented data on sleep, performan ce, and safety, and the likelihood that one 
or more candidate genes will be verified in the near future, we will collect samples and analyze the DNA of all participants who agree to  participate in a future genetic evaluation. 
These specimens will then be available at a later time to evaluate whether candidate genes verified to affect vulnerability to sleep loss pr edict the probability of Optalert lapses or of 
making an error that leads to an AE. 
1.6 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
 
The study will be looking for the occurrence of a dverse events that occur in ICU care; some 
are preventable, and some are not. Data on advers e events will be system atically collected and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_526358] [ADDRESS_683042] cases be reliably assigned on 
a case by [CONTACT_413] (e.g., was acquisition of a ca theter-related bloodstream infection due to a 
resident’s work schedule? A nurse error? Another cause?), so we anticipate that there will not be discrete, individual adverse events that would modify an a ssessment of the safety of the 
intervention or traditional work schedule’s risks; rather, we e xpect that through epi[INVESTIGATOR_424757], we will obtain useful data on the safety  of the intervention vs. traditional work 
schedules, and act as needed. Howe ver, if there are discrete even ts that clinical staff or study 
investigators believe are attributable to either  the intervention of trad itional work schedule, 
these events will be brought to the attention of the DSMB for review and action as needed.  
1.7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
1.7.1 Outcomes and Statistical Analyses 
We will compare resident-related (Specific Aim 1) and total (Specific Aim 2) rates of harmful 
medical errors (preventable adverse events) on the two schedules. As a secondary measure, 
rates of non-harmful serious medical errors (i.e., near misses) will also be compared.  In an 
intention-to-treat analysis, rates will be comp ared by [CONTACT_526359] 1-12

each center and period included as so-called offset . The models will control for period effects 
and will be used to assess treatment-period in teraction, a standard check with crossover 
trials(17).  In addition, actigraphy and sleep  diaries will be used to ascertain the minimum and mean 
number of hours of sleep obtained per night, to tal sleep time, wake af ter sleep onset (WASO; 
minutes), and sleep efficiency. We will also compare performance on the Johns Drowsiness 
Score (JDS), based on results captured by [CONTACT_526360], and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test 
(PVT).  Specifically, we will compare the time-weighted average JDS score for each shift; the proportion of the shift minutes spent with a JDS score above 4.5, the cutoff for impairment; 
and the numbers of lapses in  vigilance, defined as a re action time >500 ms, on the PVT.

12. Outcomes will be normalized as nece ssary; generalized linear mixed models 
appropriate for other outcome distributions, and/ or bootstrap standard errors will be used if 
adequate normalization cannot be achieved. In  preliminary analyses , we will assess the 
comparability of the residents in the intervention  and control periods in terms of age, gender, 
post-graduate year (PGY2 vs PGY3), as we ll as other potential  confounders of the 
intervention.  If imbalances are found, we w ill conduct sensitivity analyses in which we 
flexibly adjust for the potential confounders.   
1.7.2 Sample Size and Mini mum Detectable Effects 
Based on the Intern Sleep and Patient Safe ty Study, during which 2,203 patient-days were 
accrued under both schedules over a total of 8.5 m onths at a single center with 2 ICUs totaling 
20 beds, we 
estimate that 
approximately 46,080 patient-days will be accrued across the six centers in this study, each contributing an observation period of 8 months on each 
schedule, with an average census of 16 patients, or 80% of an average [ADDRESS_683043] schedule are the same as those 
observed in the Intern Sleep and Patient Safety Study, the new sample will provide 90% 
power to detect relative rate reductions (MD-RRRs) on the  sleep and circadian science-based 
(SCS) intervention schedule as shown in Figur e 3. Estimates are shown first assuming a scale 
factor of 1.0, correspond ing to a Poisson distribution, whil e conservative estimates assuming 
an over-dispersed Poisson distri bution with a scale factor of 2.0, are shown in parentheses. 
For overall serious medical errors, we will ha ve 90% power to detect reductions in both 
ROSTERS Protocol 1-13 
Chapter 1, Page 13 Version 1.0 3/5/13 resident-related and unit erro r rates of 7-11%; MD-RRRs for intercepted and non-intercepted 
medical errors will be between 9.5 and 19%.  Even  for the least frequent outcome but that of 
greatest interest, resident-rela ted preventable AEs, we will have 90% power to detect a 
relative reduction of 19.8% if the distribution is Poisson, and 27.5% under our conservative 
assumptions about over-dispersion. The actual re ductions seen in our preliminary study were 
larger than these thresholds in each sub-cate gory of resident-related serious errors, including 
resident-related preventable adverse events.  Thus, we expect to be adequately powered to draw definitive conclusions rega rding the effectiveness of the SCS schedule  intervention.  In 
assessing interaction/period interactions, MD- RRRs will be fourfold larger than the main 
intervention effects.  However, because reside nts will participate in at most one period, the 
potential for carryover effects is much smaller than in most crossover studies.  In addition, for sleep and work hours as well as JDS and PVT results, we estimate the expected 
sample of 300 residents will provide 90% power in 2-sided tests with alpha of 5% to detect standardized between-group diffe rences of 0.[ADDRESS_683044]  due to clustering within 
centers and residents; calcul ations are shown in Figure 4 
for minimum detectable effects (MDEs) for sleep and work hours, based on standard  deviations observed for 
sleep and work hours observed in the ICU pi[INVESTIGATOR_526320]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Because 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_526321] d not collect data on other sleep 
outcomes (e.g. WASO, sleep efficiency) or the 
performance outcomes (JDS and PVT), the standard ized units are also shown in Figure 4. These 
calculations show that the study will be powered to detect small-to-moderate intervention effects on 
these outcomes, even if the desi gn effect is as large as 2.

data entry/data editing process is monitored by a number of standard monitoring reports that 
will be available on the website.  An audit tra il is maintained which includes the date of 
change, time of change, description of data ch ange, and the study ID of the person making the 
change.  The DCC will also serve as the Reading Center  for the actigraphy, Optalert and PVT datasets. 
DCC staff will perform an initia l review of the file s upon receipt and report any issues to the 
clinical site staff; later DCC staff will clean and merge the device data with the form data.  
 The DCC will prepare comprehensive ‘clean’ data sets for analysis, providing the analysis-
ready files to the CCC and others as necessary, for statistical analysis purposes. The DCC will 
also ensure that any entity receiving the dataset will have a Data Use Agreement on file, signed by [CONTACT_526362]. The DCC will also be responsible for 
preparing a public release data set to be housed within NHLBI’s BioLINCC (or a comparable 
public data repository) no later than [ADDRESS_683047].  
1.8.3 Data Management and Study Progress 
The study website which includes a number of data management features and reports to 
enable clinical sites and study investigators to monitor data  collection and study progress. 
Data Management features include a data in ventory, lists of missing forms and queries by 
[CONTACT_333268], and tools to re solve queries and update data vi a the website. Reports can be 
custom-designed to meet study needs and could include: 
 Enrollment in aggregate and by [CONTACT_3725] 
 Demographics in aggregate and by [CONTACT_3725] 
 Early Discontinuation in aggregate and by [CONTACT_3725] 
1.8.4 Staff Training 
Site staff (physician observers, nurse data extractors and study coordinators) will be trained 
intensively in the detection of medical errors and adverse events  using an estab lished training 
protocol. Inter-rater reliability will be verifi ed during the study. Staff w ill also be instructed 
on procedures for entering data into electron ic data collection forms and transmitting these 
data to the DCC. Lastly, staff will be traine d in the operation of the actigraph and Optalert 
devices, as well as the PVT tests. 
1.[ADDRESS_683048] (IRB) Review 
This protocol and informed consent documents , and any subsequent modifications, will be

copy will be documented in the study participan t’s record. The DCC will ensure that all 
clinical site informed consents are cons istent and include required elements.  
1.9.3 Participant Confidentiality 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Sites  
In order to protect confidentiality of the research participants as well as the patients they treat, 
both will be assigned a unique study identification number, whic h will be used to refer to 
them on all study forms. The list of codes linki ng resident-subjects’ and patients’ names and 
study IDs will be kept by [CONTACT_358865] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a sepa rate password protected computer in a locked 
office at that site. Each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_526322]. 
These identifying data will not be transmitted outsi de of the originating institution. Risk to 
patient confidentiality will likewise be minimized. All information will be  de-identified at the 
point of data analysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Data Coordinating Center 
The DCC follows standard operating procedures (SOPs) for computer system security to 
ensure the confidentiality and validity of study data.  The SOPs are designed to prevent 
unauthorized access and limit authorized acce ss to our computer systems and are in 
compliance with established standards for Info rmation Technology Security.  Our network is 
privately maintained, hardware fire-walled and none of the workstations or database servers 
can be directly addressed from outside the Local Area Network. Study website and database 
access requires a network domain account with  appropriate account-specific permission on 
the database. All requests for new accounts and acce ss to the database must be documented by 
a System Access Request Form si gned by [CONTACT_52931].

ROSTERS Protocol 1-4 
Chapter 1, Page 4 Version 1.2 6/12/15 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
 
Objective: 
To conduct a multi-center randomized crossover tr ial in six pediatric ICUs staffed by [CONTACT_526350]2 
and PGY3 residents to compare the effectivenes s and safety of a sleep and circadian science-
based (SCS) intervention schedule with a traditio nal schedule that includes frequent shifts of 
24 hours or longer.  
Study Population: 
Second and third year (P GY2 and PGY3) residents 
 
Study Design: 
Multi-center randomized crossover trial 
 
Interventions: 
Sleep and circadian science-based interventi on schedule versus a tr aditional schedule 
 
Primary outcomes: 
Resident-related preventable adverse events and near misses 
 
Secondary Outcomes: 
ICU-wide preventable adverse events and near misses 
Resident neurobehavioral performa nce and predicted driving safety 
 
Study Duration: 
12 months (4 month wash-in period follo wed by 8 months of data collection) 
ROSTERS Protocol 1-5 
Chapter 1, Page 5 Version 1.2 6/12/15 1.1 STUDY AIMS 
1.1.1 Aim 1: 
To test the hypothesis that P GY2&3 residents working on an SCS intervention schedule  will 
make significantly fewer harmful medical errors (preventable adverse events) and other serious 
medical errors (near misses) while caring fo r ICU patients than residents working on a 
traditional schedule ; (primary endpoints: resident-related preventable adverse events and near 
misses)  
 
1.1.2 Aim 2:  
To test the hypothesis that rates of harmful me dical errors (preventab le adverse events) and 
other serious medical errors (near misses) throughout the ICU (i.e., those involving and those 
not involving residents) will be lower in ICUs when PGY2&3 residents work on an SCS 
intervention schedule  than when residents work on a traditional schedule; (major secondary 
endpoints: ICU-wide preventable adverse events and near misses)  
 
1.1.3 Aim 3: 
To test the hypothesis that resident physicians’ risk of neurobehavioral performance failures 
and motor vehicle crashes – as assessed throug h drive diaries, End of Rotation Survey and 
simple visual reaction time tasks [Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) lapses] – will be lower 
on the SCS intervention schedule  than on the traditional schedule. (maj or secondary endpoints: 
resident neurobehavioral performa nce and predicted driving safety)  
 
1.[ADDRESS_683063]-year residents (interns; PGY1s) worki ng recurrent extended duration shifts (>24 hours) 
make more serious medical er rors than do those working sh ifts of <16 consecutive hours; 
moreover, PGY1s working extended duration shifts  suffer more injuries on the job, and have 
an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes (M VCs) on the drive home from work.(1-8) In 2009, 
after a year-long comprehensive study, the Institut e of Medicine (IOM) co ncluded that while it 
remained unclear whether resident sleep depriv ation led to patient harm, “the scientific 
evidence base establishes that human performa nce begins to deterior ate after 16 hours of 
wakefulness.”(9;10) They consequently called fo r the elimination of all resident physician 
shifts without sleep over 16 consecutive hours.  In response, beginning in July 2011, the Accredit ation Council for Graduate Medical Education 
(ACGME) limited interns to no more than 16 co nsecutive hours of work; second year (PGY2) 
and higher residents, however, will continue to  work for up to 28 consecutive hours.(11) In 
choosing not to more substantively limit the hours of PGY2 and higher residents – who 
represent approximately 80% of all physicians-in-training – the ACGME indicated that in its 
view, insufficient data existed to support policy change for more senior trainees. 
ROSTERS Protocol 1-6 
Chapter 1, Page 6 Version 1.2 6/12/15  
In this study, we seek to conclusively addre ss two knowledge gaps: 1) th e lack of data on the 
relationship between PGY2 and higher sleep depriv ation and patient safety; and 2) the lack of 
data on the relationship between resident sleep deprivation and preventable patient injuries. 
 
1.3 STUDY DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS 
 
The study is a clustered randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of eliminating 
residents’ traditional 24-hour shifts in ICUs. The tr ial will take place in 6 academic medical centers 
nationwide, in three waves of two centers each.(Figure  1) One of each pair of  units will initially be 
randomly assigned to the traditiona l schedule (i.e., in which overni ght shifts of 24-28 hours continue 
to occur every 4 nights), or to the SCS intervention schedule (i.e., in which re sidents are limited to 16 
consecutive work hours; sleep before night duty is promoted; and time off is arranged to allow 
recovery from sleep debt.) 
Our planned timeline will be as follows: after a [ADDRESS_683064] 1; the traditional schedule will con tinue in the other PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890].  There will be a 4-month 
wash-in period, after which time [ADDRESS_683065] in  intervention (in black, 
Figure 1) and traditional (in blue) ICUs. After 8 months of data coll ection, the units will cross over 
(traditional to intervention schedul e; intervention to traditional). Following another 4-month wash-in 
period, there will be 8 additional months of data co llection. Study sites in waves two and three will 
follow the same pattern. Of note, each intervention period will be scheduled to occur entirely within a single academic year, and will be  preceded or followed (12 months  apart) by a control period that 
will also occur entirely within an academic year.

1.4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
 

ROSTERS Protocol 1-7 
Chapter 1, Page 7 Version 1.2 6/12/[ADDRESS_683066] 21 years of age. Four to eight residents will be 
recruited per month at each clinical center for to tal of approximately 50 residents per site and 
approximately 300 subjects study-wide.  
1.4.1 Recruitment 
Sites will submit a waiver of informed consent fo r the collection of patient data, but will obtain 
residents’ written informed consent to obser ve them, and collect resident-specific data. 
Working with program directors at each hosp ital, the Principal Investigators will make 
presentations each year to all residents to desc ribe our study and request volunteer participants. 
Residents are free not to participat e in the study; if they choose not  to participate, they will not 
be followed by [CONTACT_526351], but the unit schedule 
will proceed on the traditional or SCS intervention schedule  as planned. 
1.4.2 Randomization 
The intervention will be implemented in one rand omly assigned study site in each of the three 
waves and the second site will remain on the traditional schedule. After 8 months of data collection, the units will cross over (traditional to intervention schedul e; intervention to traditional). 
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will be responsi ble for randomly assigning sites to their initial 
study arm.  
1.4.[ADDRESS_683067] in pediat ric intensive care units (PI[INVESTIGATOR_174927]). In general, subjects will 
continue to carry out their normal activities and responsibili ties when working either the 
intervention or traditional schedule. Throughout the PI[INVESTIGATOR_526317], subjects will complete a 
daily sleep diary and wear actiwat ches, described further below, to  validate the results of self-
reported sleep..  They will also periodically comp lete psychomotor vigilance tests (PVTs) to 
monitor their vigilance.  At the completion of their rotations, all subject s will complete an End 
of Rotation survey. For every e xperimental intervention, there wi ll be written protocols and 
checklists used to insure uniformity in  the execution of standard procedures. 
1.5.1 Detection of Errors and Adverse Events 
We will use a very intensive, four-pronged data collection approach to comprehensively 
measure rates of all errors and adverse events.  
ROSTERS Protocol 1-8 
Chapter 1, Page 8 Version 1.2 6/12/15 [IP_ADDRESS] Continuous Observation  
A team of five physician research associates wi ll conduct direct observatio n of resident subjects 
working in the units, [ADDRESS_683068] additional information. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Voluntary and solicited reports 
Forms will be made available and prominently posted in the ICUs to facilitate voluntary 
reporting of possible errors and events by [CONTACT_526352]. Chart reviewers will also request reports from staff of errors and adverse events [ADDRESS_683069] additional information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of formal incident reports 
In each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], formal incident reports will be collected if permitted; if any institutions will 
not allow access to these data, we  will request that dupl icate study reports be filed by [CONTACT_526353]. In addition, in any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_526318], the computerized AE monitors will also be 
interrogated for study-unit events. Nurse data extractors will collect additional information on 
each incident identified. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Chart surveillance 
The nurse data extractors will serve as the focal  point for data collection and organization, and 
will follow up and review all data collected by [CONTACT_255483], reported by [CONTACT_3655], and detected via 
incident reporting systems. In addition to coor dinating collection from ot her sources, reviewers 
will examine all orders and charts 5 days per week; a focused version of the Institute for 
Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Gl obal Trigger Tool (consisting of the intensive care module, 
cares module, and medication module triggers)(12)  will be used to increase the sensitivity of 
adverse event detection. Reviews on Monday w ill include a review of the weekend. Data 
collected for each incident will include a descri ption and classification of the event, patient 
information, services and pers onnel involved, and additional work  resulting from the event. 
Medication incidents will furthe r include name, dose, route and category of the drug involved. 
1.5.2 Classification by [CONTACT_926], a ttribution, and preventability 
Physician observers and research nurses will identify suspected errors and adverse events. Two 
independent physician reviewers will  subsequently classify events  as errors, potential adverse 
events (near misses), or adverse events. All even ts will be rated on severity using the modified 
NCC-MERP scale.(12;13) Preventability will be  rated using a four point Likert scale. 
Disagreements will be resolved by [CONTACT_23091]. Events for which consensus cannot be reached 
ROSTERS Protocol 1-9 
Chapter 1, Page 9 Version 1.2 6/12/[ADDRESS_683070] data on resident s’ sleep and work hours 
using the methods described below.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sleep and work logs 
A diary of sleep and wake times will be maintained by [CONTACT_526355]. A post-sleep 
questionnaire will be completed immediately fo llowing wake time from all sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_526319], duration, consolidation, 
quality, and wakefulness during sl eep, as well as daily work hour s. Our sleep and work logs 
have previously been validated; hours of sleep  and work reported using this methodology have 
a high correlation with polysomnographically-va lidated total sleep time (r=0.94) as well as 3rd-
party documented work hours (r=0.98).(2) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ambulatory physiologic monitoring 
To further validate reported sleep times in this st udy, wrist activity and am bient light levels will 
be monitored for the entire duration of residents’  rotations with a soli d-state, portable data 
collection device (Motionlogger BASIC; Ambu latory Monitoring, Inc., Ardsley, NY). The 
Motionlogger recorder is a small wrist worn device that measures activity and ambient light exposure; it is waterproof and powered by a 3V, 150 mAmp-hr Lithium Ma nganese battery that 
has a lifetime of 60 days. Data are pr eserved if the ba ttery expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054].  
1.5.5 Measuring Resident Vigilance  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PVT.  
In the proposed study, we will also have resident ph ysician subjects complete Psychomotor Vigilance 
Testing – an established metric of  vigilance that is sensitive to  sleep deprivation and circadian 
misalignment (14) – during one shift per week, ev ery five hours.  Completing the PVT requires 10 
minutes and provides data on vigila nce that will be used to deri ve an independent measure of 
neurobehavioral performance while subjects are on the job. Subjects will also be asked to complete 
the Karolinska Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (KSS), a self-report sc ale that measures alertness, before and after 
each test. 
1.5.6 Additional Measures 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Self-reported attentional failures, motor ve hicle crashes (MVCs), and percutaneous 
injuries 
Through end-of-rotation surveys, we  will also collect data on resi dents’ self-reported attentional 
failures, MVCs, near-miss MVCs, and percutan eous injuries using the instruments we 
ROSTERS Protocol 1-10 
Chapter 1, Page 10 Version 1.2 6/12/15 previously developed for use in our na tional cohort study. Any reported MVCs and 
percutaneous injuries will be validated by [CONTACT_526357] (e.g. police reports, 
repair bills, etc. for MVCs), as was done in  our cohort study.(1;4) When MVCs occur on the 
commute to and from work, we will also have drive diary data availa ble. We believe that 
collecting MVC and percutaneous da ta is important given their implications for resident safety, 
but with 300 anticipated subjects in the study, an d the relative infrequenc y of these occupational 
injuries,(1;4) we will have power to detect an  effect of the intervention on these outcomes only 
if they are reduced more than two-fold. As suc h, analysis of these outco mes will be considered 
exploratory. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Educational Measures 
As part of the study, participants will have th e option of enrolling in  an online educational 
platform entitled OPENPediatrics. OPENPediat rics is a free, open access, peer-reviewed, 
digital learning platform that utilizes the latest in innovati ve technology to provide robust 
continuing medical education. OPENPediatri cs is sponsored th rough [LOCATION_011] Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_526328]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Website: http://openpediatrics.org ). Through a feature entitled the Le arning Pathways, participants will 
have access to the ROSTERS curriculum, or a similar ICU learning curriculum approved by 
[CONTACT_20908]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This curriculum is comprised of [ADDRESS_683071]. This unique format will allow for asynchronous learning, so 
that participants can complete their educati onal lessons outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_526329]-duty hours. OPENPediatrics’ robust analytics will allow research staff 
to track each participant’s submissions as they  progress through the curriculum. Pre-test and 
post-test scores as well as duration in each module will allow researchers to note the 
educational gains made throughout the curriculum , and compare each part icipant’s results in 
the control and Sleep and Circadian Science-ba sed (SCS) intervention arms. A vigorous set of 
security measures will allow the analytic data fr om the application to be securely passed from 
the application to the data collection program, Cognos. As standard practice for the 
OPENPediatrics data storage procedures this da ta will be stored on IBM’s secure servers, and 
IBM’s analytic department will control access to th is data. All residents in the unit will have 
access to the platform so no delineation between  non subject residents and subject residents 
can be made by [CONTACT_526366]. Resident data specific to each site will be sent from OPENPediatrics to 
each site coordinator; the site coordinator will th en delete all data asso ciated with non-subject 
residents. These measures are being taken so on ly site coordinators have knowledge of which 
data sets are associated with resident subjects . The team will work with the site PI [CONTACT_175246]-
identify the data by [CONTACT_526367]’s name /email. The data will only be stored on 
password-protected computers. Data will only be reported as de-identified, aggregated data. 
On their end-of-rotation surveys, they will report their impressions of their educational 
experience. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of Salivary Samples for Subsequent Genetic Analyses 
In light of the emerging science exploring the gene tic predictors of susceptibility to sleep loss 
and circadian misalignment, salivary samples will be collected to measure genetic modifiers of 
the SCS intervention’s effects. Unfortunately, the limited number of subjects (~300) being

1.6 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
 
1.6.1 Patient Safety 
The study will be looking for the occurrence of adve rse events that occur in ICU care; some are 
preventable, and some are not. Data on adverse events will be systematically collected and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_526368] [ADDRESS_683073] cases be reliably assigned on a case by [CONTACT_413] (e.g., was acquisition of a ca theter-related bloodstream  infection due to a resident’s work 
schedule? A nurse error? Another cause?), so we anticipate that there will not be discrete, 
individual adverse events that would modify an assessment of the safety of the intervention or 
traditional work schedule’s risks; rather, we expect that through epi[INVESTIGATOR_19185], we 
will obtain useful data on the safety of the in tervention vs. traditional work schedules, and act 
as needed. However, if there are discrete events that clinical staff or study investigators believe 
are attributable to either the intervention of traditional work schedule, these events will be 
brought to the attention of the DSMB for review and action as needed.  
 
1.6.2 Resident Safety 
As part of this study, we will  ask resident subjects questi ons about depression, including 
questions about suicidal thoughts and plans, moto r vehicle incidents, drowsy driving, including 
falling asleep at the wheel, and occupational expo sures. The Data Coordinating Center for the 
study reviews survey responses, an d if responses indicate suicid ality, 3 or more occupational 
exposure reports, and/or motor vehicle cras hes in which the damage was >$1000 and/or 
drowsiness was reported as a factor, the study prin ciple investigator will be asked to follow up 
with the resident subject. Near misses will not  be followed up on. Add itionally, initial reports 
of falling asleep at the wheel will trigger a follow up with by [CONTACT_25733]’s research study 
coordinator; 3 or more responses of falling asl eep while driving will trigger a follow up by [CONTACT_204816]’s principle investigator. Specifically in regard s to questions concerning suicide, if resident 
subjects respond to the question “Over the past  two weeks, how often have you thought about 
or wanted to commit suicide?” with “Some of the time,” “Most of the time,” or “All of the time,” regardless of whether they respond “Yes ” or “No” to “Do you have a plan?”, the 
following message will appear on the form:  “Your res ponse to the previous  questions causes 
us to be concerned for your welf are. All reports of suicide idea tion will be reporte d to your site 
PI, who will then initiate your in stitution’s protocols for time ly intervention and action, in 
compliance with their organizational rules and st andards.” These criteria were discussed and

1.7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
1.7.1 Outcomes and Statistical Analyses 
We will compare resident-related (Specific Aim 1) and total (Specific Aim 2) rates of harmful 
medical errors (preventable adverse events) on the two schedules. As a secondary measure, 
rates of non-harmful serious medical errors (i.e., near misses) will also be compared.  In an 
intention-to-treat analysis, rates will be comp ared by [CONTACT_526369] t standard errors to account for both over-
dispersion and clustering by [CONTACT_526370] (15), and the number of patient-days at risk in each 
center and period included as so-called offset. The models will control for period effects and will be used to assess treatment-period interact ion, a standard check with crossover trials(16). 
 In addition, actigraphy and sleep  diaries will be used to ascertain the minimum and mean 
number of hours of sleep obtained per night, to tal sleep time, wake af ter sleep onset (WASO; 
minutes), and sleep efficiency. We will also compare performance based on results captured by [CONTACT_526371] (PVT).  Speci fically, we will compar e the the numbers of 
lapses in vigilance, defined as a reaction time >500 ms, on the PVT. This Inte ntion-to-treat 
comparison will be made using linear mixed mode ls for repeated measures, with nested random 
effects to account for clustering with in clinical center and residents
12. Outcomes will be 
normalized as necessary; generalized linear mi xed models appropriate for other outcome 
distributions, and/or bootstrap sta ndard errors will be used if ad equate normalization cannot be 
achieved. In preliminary analyses, we will asse ss the comparability of the residents in the 
intervention and control periods in  terms of age, gender, post-gr aduate year (PGY2 vs PGY3), 
as well as other potential conf ounders of the intervention.  If im balances are found, we will 
conduct sensitivity analyses in which we flexib ly adjust for the potential confounders.   
1.7.2 Sample Size and Mini mum Detectable Effects 
Based on the Intern Sleep and Patient Safe ty Study, during which 2,203 patient-days were 
accrued under both schedules over a total of 8.5 m onths at a single center with 2 ICUs totaling 
20 beds, we estimate that 
approximately 
46,080 patient-days will be accrued across the six centers in this study, each contributing an 
observation 
period of 8 months on each 
schedule, with an average census of 16 patients, or 80% of an average [ADDRESS_683075] schedule are the same as those observed Serious medical

interest, resident-related and total preventable AEs, are bolded. 

ROSTERS Protocol 1-13 
Chapter 1, Page 13 Version 1.2 6/12/15 in the Intern Sleep and Patient Safety Study, the new sample will provide 90% power to detect 
relative rate reductions (MD-RRRs) on the  sleep and circadian science-based (SCS) 
intervention schedule as shown in Figure 3. Esti mates are shown first assuming a scale factor 
of 1.0, corresponding to a Poisson distribution, wh ile conservative estimates assuming an over-
dispersed Poisson distribution with  a scale factor of 2.0, are show n in parentheses. For overall 
serious medical errors, we will have 90% power to detect reductions in both resident-related and unit error rates of 7-11%; MD-RRRs for in tercepted and non-interc epted medical errors 
will be between 9.5 and 19%.  Even for the least frequent outcome but  that of greatest interest, 
resident-related preventable AEs, we will have  90% power to detect a relative reduction of 
19.8% if the distribution is Po isson, and 27.5% under our conser vative assumptions about over-
dispersion. The actual reductions seen  in our preliminary study were larger than these thresholds 
in each sub-category of resident-related seriou s errors, including resident-related preventable 
adverse events.  Thus, we expect to be adequately powered to draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the SCS schedule  intervention.  In asse ssing interaction/period 
interactions, MD-RRRs will be fourfold larger th an the main intervention effects.  However, 
because residents will participate in at most one period, the potential for carryover effects is 
much smaller than in most crossover studies.  In addition, for sleep and work hour s as well as PVT results, we es timate the expected sample of 300 
residents will provide 90% power in  2-sided tests with alpha of 5% to detect standardized between-
group differences of 0.[ADDRESS_683076]

ROSTERS Protocol 1-14 
Chapter 1, Page 14 Version 1.2 6/12/[ADDRESS_683078] Manager and other Clinical Coordinating Center  (CCC) staff will be responsible for checking 
the daily data edits and working in conjunction with the sites to address them.  This data entry/data editing process is monitored by a number of standard monitoring reports that will be available on the website.  An audit trail is ma intained which includes the date of change, time 
of change, description of data change, and the study ID of the person making the change. 
 The DCC will also serve as the Reading Cent er for the actigraphy and PVT datasets. DCC 
staff will perform an initial review of the f iles upon receipt and report any issues to the 
clinical site staff; later DCC staff will clean and merge the device data with the form data.  
 The DCC will prepare comprehensive ‘clean’ data sets for analysis, providing the analysis-
ready files to the CCC and others as necessary, for statistical analysis purposes. The DCC will 
also ensure that any entity receiving the dataset will have a Data Use Agreement on file, signed by [CONTACT_526362]. The DCC will also be responsible for 
preparing a public release data set to be housed within NHLBI’s BioLINCC (or a comparable 
public data repository) no later than [ADDRESS_683079].  
1.8.3 Data Management and Study Progress 
The study website which includes a number of data  management features and reports to enable 
clinical sites and study investigators to moni tor data collection and study progress. Data 
Management features include a data inventory, lists of missing forms and queries by [CONTACT_526372], and tools to resolve queri es and update data via the we bsite. Reports can be custom-
designed to meet study n eeds and could include: 
 Enrollment in aggregate and by [CONTACT_3725] 
 Demographics in aggregate and by [CONTACT_3725] 
 Early Discontinuation in aggregate and by [CONTACT_3725] 
1.8.[ADDRESS_683080] cases de signed to calibrate the observers’ assessments. 
At least twice during each 8 month period of data  collection, for each wa ve of sites, the DCC 
will examine the rates of events by [CONTACT_526373]. Re-training of physician observers will occur as needed to ensure 
consistent reporting of suspected medical errors  across staff and sites.  Documentation of the 
analyses of event rates as well as the staff trai ning will be maintained by [CONTACT_15791]. Staff will 
also be instructed on procedures for entering data into electronic data collection forms and 
transmitting these data to the DCC. Lastly, staff will be trained in the operation of the actigraphs 
as well as administrati on of the PVT tests.

 Definition  of medical error outcomes.   The primary outcome of the study will be resident‐related harmful medical 
errors (preventable  adverse events) and other medical errors (near misses), as determined  by [CONTACT_526378]. In brief, all potential medical errors and adverse events reported
 by [CONTACT_526379],  blinded to the site of origin. Physician  reviewers  will classify events 
as: (1) adverse event / harm; (2) intercepted  near misses with potential for harm; (3) non‐intercepted  near miss 
with potential for harm; (4) error with little or no potential for harm; and (5) exclusion.  If an event is classified as 
“adverse event / harm”, the reviewers  will then classify the level of harm and indicate to what extent the incident 
was preventable.  Discordant  reviews will be resolved by [CONTACT_526380] a 3rd reviewer,  as needed. 
Total ICU‐wide preventable  adverse events and near misses will be secondary  outcomes.   
 Definition  of secondary  sleep outcomes.  Actigraphy  data and sleep diaries will be used to ascertain the minimum

sticks, body fluid exposures,  depression,  and suicidal ideation are captured in the End of Rotation Survey as well. 
Resident SAEs are reported as they occur.   
 Preliminary  analyses.  Preliminary  analyses include ongoing efforts to check and clean the data. The electronic  
data collection  forms are designed to minimize missing data and skip pattern errors, by [CONTACT_526384]‐questions,  based
 on responses  to parent questions.  A series of edit checks are 
run daily to detect data inconsistencies  (eg, inconsistent  dates). Furthermore,  additional  checks are run on the 
entire data set to check for inconsistencies  or errors across forms. The Resident Sleep/Work  and Drive Diary data 
is reviewed  a few times per week for errors and missing data. Diary findings are communicated  to the sites, who 
confirm any diary changes or additions  with Residents.    
 
Objectively  measured  sleep data will be collected using an actigraph  (Motionlogger ‐L model;  Ambulatory  
Monitoring  Inc, Ardsley, NY). Actigraph  files will be processed  at the DCC using manufacturer ‐specific software 
(Action‐W2 software,  version  2.7.2288).   Participating  residents will complete  sleep diaries for the time period 
they wore the actigraph,  which includes time into and time out of bed and times the actigraph  was removed.  This 
information  will be used in editing the actigraphy  data files to set intervals for when the participant  was in bed 
trying to sleep, and to delete time when the actigraph  was removed.  Inter‐scorer reliability  for editing the 
actigraphy  data files has been previously  found to be high in our group (intra‐class coefficient  = 0.95). (Blackwell  
2005) Sleep‐scoring algorithms  available in the software will be used to determine  sleep from wake times. (Cole 
1992, Girardin 2001) These algorithms  calculate a moving average, which takes into account the activity levels 
immediately  prior to and after the current minute, to determine  if the time point should be coded as sleep or 
wake. The summary  measure of total sleep time across a 24‐hr period will reflect data averaged  over all 24‐hr 
periods the device was worn in order to obtain a more representative  characterization  of usual sleep patterns 
during the rotation. 
 
ROSTERS     September  23, [ADDRESS_683096] needed data from the site, we will determine  whether the observers  report similar rates of 
suspected  events within centers, by [CONTACT_526385]. We will also examine rates of discordance  between 
adjudicators  periodically  to identify and address potential problems.   
 Assessment  of balance between schedules.  To assess balance 
of the treatment  and control samples, we will 
compare resident characteristics  by [CONTACT_177326],  stratified by [CONTACT_526386], assessing  within‐center and overall 
differences,  as well as center by [CONTACT_526387].   These checks will use linear, logistic, and other generalized  
linear models as appropriate  to the distribution  of each of the baseline covariates.   Baseline variables to be 
considered  will include resident age, gender, race, post‐graduate year (PGY2 vs PGY3), body mass index, lifestyle 
factors (including  smoking, alcohol use and caffeine intake), physical activity and medical history (including  sleep 
apnea).   
 Analysis of medical error outcomes.   Rates per 1000 patient‐days of the 
medical error outcomes  will be compared  
by [CONTACT_526388]‐link Poisson models, with clinical center, period, and schedule as fixed effects, robust 
standard errors to account for potential over‐dispersion,  and the log of the number of patient‐days at risk as an 
offset. Outcome  events and total patient days will be summed over each study period for each clinical site, 
omitting missed observer shifts, based on reports of the missed shifts and corresponding  patient censuses from 
the sites. We will also assess treatment ‐period interaction,  a standard check with crossover  trials.   
 
Analysis of secondary  outcomes.   Comparisons  of actigraphic  outcomes  will be made using regression  models for 
summary  outcomes  constructed  for each resident over their entire period, again controlling  for clinical center and 
period. These outcomes  will be normalized  as necessary;  generalized  linear models appropriate  for other outcome 
distributions,  and/or bootstrap  standard errors will be used if adequate  normalization  cannot be achieved.   
 
Analyses of safety outcomes.   Numbers of resident needle sticks, fluid exposures,  MVAs, MVA near misses, MVAs 
with injuries, as well as numbers of each reported as related to fatigue or drowsy driving, will be compared  by 
[CONTACT_526389].  Offsets will be calculated  as the numbers 
of resident days determined  using work and drive diaries.  Because MVA injuries are expected to too uncommon  
for meaningful  statistical  comparison,  they will be presented  using individual  narrative descriptions.  
 
Mediation  of the effects schedule on medical errors by [CONTACT_526390].  We will assess mediation  of the effects of 
schedule on resident‐related harmful medical errors by [CONTACT_526391] 24‐hour sleep times and PVT 
scores. We will use simulation  methods (Imai 2010) as implemented  in the mediation  package in R [R Foundation  
for Statistical  Computing,  Vienna]. 
 
Sensitivity  analyses. Two sensitivity  analyses will be performed.     
 If imbalances  are found between schedules  in our preliminary  assessment,  described  above, we will conduct 
sensitivity  analyses, both for primary and secondary  outcomes,  in which we flexibly adjust for the potential 
confounders  that are associated  at P<0.[ADDRESS_683097] one center.  These will 
include analyses adjusting for the number of residents  with sleep disordered  breathing,  including sleep apnea; 
additional  sensitivity  analysis of the secondary  outcomes  will exclude these residents.   
 If the numbers of missed observer shifts are imbalanced  by [CONTACT_177326],  we will conduct sensitivity  analyses 
using multiple imputation  of resident and total medical errors during unobserved  shifts under both standard 
missing at random (MAR) and also plausible missing not at random (MNAR) assumptions.   Specific MNAR 
scenarios  will include doubling of the error rates during unobserved  shifts in both schedules,  first 
simultaneously,  then one at a time.

 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526336].  The DSMB Guidelines  for recommending  continuation,  modification,  or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526337]‐statistical  issues and include the 
possibilities  of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526338], stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526339], stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526340], and modification  of 
protocol.  
 Primary outcome for assessing  benefit and harm. We propose to use the numbers of resident‐related harmful 
medical errors as the primary outcome for both benefit and harm. Additional  considerations  for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526341],  including needle sticks, fluid exposures,  and MVAs.  
 Rules for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   We propose to use Lan‐DeMets methods (Lan 1983) to define symmetric  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526342];  
the DSMB may decide to use a more liberal rule for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526343]‐I error differentially  to 
efficacy and harm.  We will use an alpha spending function resulting in boundaries  similar to O’Brien‐Fleming, 
making it difficult to stop early but inducing minimal shrinkage  in the alpha for the end‐of‐trial analysis. We 
propose two interim analyses of treatment  effects on the primary benefit/harm  endpoint.   The first analysis will 
occur when Sites [ADDRESS_683098] completed  both schedules;  and the second when Sites 1‐[ADDRESS_683099] look, as well as 
for sites 5 and 6 at the second, but not included in the interim analysis; the rationale for these exclusions  is that 
between‐site differences  would confound  schedule if the sites contributing  outcomes  for only one schedule were 
included. With an overall type‐I error rate of 5% allocated equally to benefit and harm, critical values of the Z‐
statistics at the first, second, and final analyses will be 2.67, 2.32, and 2.03 respectively,  corresponding  to 2‐sided 
p‐values of 0.008, 0.021, and 0.043. The DSMB will consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526344] Z‐statistic at the first and second interim analysis exceeds the boundary  values of 2.[ADDRESS_683100] a 10% reduction  in overall resident‐related medical errors, and a 25% reduction  in 
resident‐related preventable  AEs (Lan 1982; Halperin 1982). These analyses entail no inflation of the overall type‐I 
error rate, and will be conducted  in conjunction  with the two interim analyses of benefit/harm.   The DSMB will 
consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526345] 50% for both outcomes.  These decisions are complex and the guidelines  may be further developed  by 
[CONTACT_526392], with the assistance  of the DCC.  
 
Interim Analyses 
 An unblinded  statistical  analyst at the DCC will analyze the major endpoints  at the time points specified above, 
and reports will be prepared  for presentation  to the DSMB. Except for designated  NHLBI and DCC staff, all 
investigators  and staff will remain blinded to interim results. Interim reports will be derived 
from the database as 
it exists on pre‐specified dates, and full copi[INVESTIGATOR_526346]. The interim analysis tables will be the same as the tables used in the open and closed sessions of the 
DSMB meetings,  but results will be stratified by [CONTACT_526393] P‐values. Please see a list of the tables below:

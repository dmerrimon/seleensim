 5 Introduction  
Surgical site infections (S SIs) are now the most common group of healthcare 
associated infections (HAIs) and are a significant cause of preventable morbidity and mortality 
in the [LOCATION_002].1  These infections result in significant patient suffering and excess health 
care costs up to $[ADDRESS_130890] common major surgical procedure performed in women.  In 
2013, 1.3 million cesareans were performed in the  US and up to 12% of these were 
complicated by [CONTACT_117345].4,5  
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a closed, sealed system that applies 
negative (or sub -atmospheric) pressure to the wound surface.  Used since the 1990s to treat 
open wounds, experimental ev idence suggests that NPWT promotes wound healing by 
[CONTACT_117346], approximating the wound edges, and reducing bacterial contamination.6-
16 Three  brands of a modified, single -use, battery -powered, portable NPWT devices 
PrevenaTM (KCI [LOCATION_003], San Antonio, TX), PI[INVESTIGATOR_117325] (Smith & Nephew, Hull, [LOCATION_006]) and Invia Motion 
(Medela) have been FDA-cleared for prophylactic application after wound closure at the time 
of surgery.  Although the precise mechanism of action of prophylactic NPWT is unclear, 
experimental evidence  suggests that NPWT reduces bacterial contamination, edema, and 
exudates while increasing microvascular blood flow and promoting granulation tissue by 
[CONTACT_117347].17 - 21 Computer and physical models of 
NPWT applied  to closed incisions demonstrate a decrease in lateral tensile stress by 50% and 
in shear stress by [CONTACT_726] 75%, leading to improved apposition of wound edges.[ADDRESS_130891] included use of the Medela Invia Motion device . 
This study is a prospective case series to assess patient centered outcomes of the M edela 
INVIA Motion prophylactic NPWT system at cesarean delivery

Note: Where relevant, Competent Authorities should be informed.  
 
11.3 Study termination  
Medela AG  will be allowed to monitor the progression of the clinical investigation. Medela 
and the Institution shall jointly agree on the scope and plan of the monitoring.  If warranted, 
the clinical investigation may be suspended or discontinued by [CONTACT_117365].  
In the event of clinical investigation termination or suspension, Investigator  will send a report 
outlining the circumstances to the IRB, and a ll l investigators. A suspended or terminated 
clinical investigation may not be re -initiated without approval of the reviewing IRB. 
 
12 Safety  
NPWT is currently used in clinical obstetric practice. Further, the adverse events reported with 
the use of prophylactic NPTW at cesarean were minor.  Therefore, no serious or life -
threatening adverse events are expected in this trial. Nonetheless, the following measures will 
be taken to monitor and investigate adverse events.  
 
12.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
During the  course of this clinical investigation adverse events might occur. For the purposes 
of this study the following categories of adverse events are relevant for reporting:  
• Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI)  
• Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
• Adverse Device Eff ect (ADE)  
• Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
 
Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events in the following manner:  
• Routine monitoring by [CONTACT_13922], nurses and research team during inpatient stay, 
with data obtained from the subject’s EMR by [CONTACT_3647].  
• Patients will be scheduled for standard of care follow -up with their provider at [ADDRESS_130907]’s EMR 
after 6 weeks postpartum.  
• Medical records will be sought for any patient or pr ovider -reported complications.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_130908] (AESI)  
For this study, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other 
abnormal assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, X -rays, vital signs) per se are not report ed 
 Clinical Investigation Plan                            Page 17 / 
25 
 
 
Version 1.0 : [ADDRESS_130909] (AESI) defined below will be recorded on the 
CRFs and in the subject’s chart.  
 
For this study, AESIs refer to:  
• Mild/moderate reactions:  
o Skin blisters  
o Wound bleeding  
o Allergic skin reaction  
 
Any current co ndition that is recorded as a pre -existing condition in the medical history, unless 
there is a change in nature, severity, or degree of incidence, is not an AE.  
 
Relation to the clinical investigation device will be assessed by [CONTACT_117366]:  
• Related  
• Not related  
 
Relation to  the procedure  will be assessed by [CONTACT_117367]:  
• Related  
• Not related  
 
12.3 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
A serious adverse  event (SAE) is any adverse event that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Maternal death  
• Serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in  
1) A life -threatening illness or injury, or  
2) A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
3) In-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
4) Medi cal or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or  
5) Injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body f unction  
 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_10396], 
without serious deteriorati on in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
 
This also applies to adverse events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117333].  
 
The assessment of 'serious ness' is independent from any relation to the investigational device.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117334] a medical need for in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117335]. For 
procedures that are commonly performed in out -patient clinic but yet requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117336] -medical needs (e.g. logistical reasons) this criterion could be considered 
 Clinical Investigation Plan                            Page 18 / 
25 
 
 
Version 1.0 : 15 November 2019  
 not applicable by [CONTACT_737]. Proper documentation of the reasons for decision is 
required in this case.  
 
Events that are planned (e.g. elective surgery) a nd documented prior to clinical investigation 
entry will not be recorded if the procedure is performed without any complications. Medication 
received during this activity may be recorded.  
 
12.4 Adverse Device Effects (ADE) & Serious Adverse Device Effects (SAD E) 
An adverse device effect is an adverse event related to the use of a study medical device  
 
This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions 
for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or a ny malfunction of the 
investigational medical device.  
 
This definition also includes any event resulting from user error or from intentional misuse of 
the investigational medical device.  
 
An ADE is classified as serious if it has resulted in any of the co nsequence characteristics of 
a serious adverse event or that might have led to any of these consequences if suitable action 
had not been taken or intervention had not been made or if circumstances had been less 
opportune.  
 
If an ADE or SADE has occurred an y retrievable part of the Invia® Motion™ Endure NPWT 
system should be returned to Medela AG  for analysis. If there is also a suspected relation to 
accessory material (guide wire etc.) the accessory material in question should also be sent to 
Medela AG  for analysis.  
 
12.5 Reporting Adverse Events  
An adverse event report will be generated for each  event  that will include the following:  
• Date of event discovery  
• Severity (mild, moderate, severe, life threatening/disabling, death)  
• Relationship to treatment  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Expected or unexpected  
• Date reported  
• Relevant notes/chart records/supporting documentation to corroborate the 
event  
• To whom event was reported (IRB, Sponsor)  
o Non-Severe AESIs and ADEs will be reported to the 
Sponsor every 6 months , and to the IRB at renewal.  
o SAEs  and [LOCATION_003]DEs  will be reported within 24 hours of 
discovery to the IRB and the Sponsor . 
 
Relationship of Reportable Events:  
An Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the drug for each AESI /ADE. 
The relationship to the device should be assessed using the guidelines presented in the 
table below.  
 
Relationship to 
Device  Description  
Related  • Previously known harmfulness of device; or  
• Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
device; or  
 Clinical Investigation Plan                            Page 19 / 
25 
 
 
Version 1.0 : 15 November 2019  
 • Follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
intervention; or  
• Is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_117337]; and  
• That is not explained by [CONTACT_117368]  • Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study 
intervention; and/or  
• Follows a known response pattern to the study device; and  
• Was unlikely to have been produced by [CONTACT_11260]’s clinical state, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy  
Possibly related  • Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study 
intervention; and/or  
• Follows a known response pattern to the study device; but  
• Could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
clinical state, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy  
Unlikely related  • Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequ ence from the time of study 
intervention; and  
• Was likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy but for which 
relationship cannot be definitely ruled out  
Not related  The adverse event can be determined with certainty to have no 
relationship to the study device  
 
Severity of Reportable Events:  
The investigator will assess the severity of the AE using the following general guidelines:  
Severity  Description  
Mild:  An AE that is usually transient, requiring no special treatment, 
and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  An AE that introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to 
the subject and may interfere with daily activities bu t is usually 
ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  
Severe:  An AE that interrupts a subject’s usually daily activity and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_40762] (a 
severe AE may not necessarily qualify as an SAE).  
Life-threaten ing: An AE that put the subject at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might 
have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity.  
 
 
Outcomes of Reportable Events:  
The investigator will categorize the outcome of each reportable event according to the 
definitions below:  
 
Status  Description  
Resolved:  The subject recovered from the SAE or AESI.  
Resolved with 
sequelae:  A condition whereby [CONTACT_40770] a diseas e or injury 
include lingering effects.  
Ongoing:  At the time of the last assessment, the event is ongoing, with an 
undetermined outcome. Note: Ongoing SAEs and AESIs are not 
considered resolved as a result of death and no SAE or AESI 
stop date should be r ecorded for an AESI that is ongoing at the 
time of death.  
Fatal:  Adverse Event directly caused death. If a subject dies during 
participation in the study the lead site should be provided with a 
copy of any post -mortem findings. Note: Death is an outcome of

 Primary objectives:  
To determine the effect of metformin intervention on breast density  assessed by [CONTACT_9268] -
acquired fat -to-water ratio (FWR -MRI). Changes in breast density will be assessed and 
compared between metformin and placebo treated groups.  
 
Secondary objectives:  
• To determine the effect of metformin intervention on metabolic disturbances and body 
weight/composition. Changes in circulating levels of insulin, IGF axis, sex steroid hormones, adipokines, and anthropometric measures  will b e assessed and compared 
between treatment groups.  
 
• To explore the application of metabolomics as a systems biology approach to assess 
the chemopreventive mechanisms of metformin. The global profiles of biochemicals 
and metabolites in nipple aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480382]  (NAF) and plasma will be assessed through 
unbiased metabolome wide analysis to determine the metabolic changes induced by 
[CONTACT_872494]. We will also explore whether metformin-
induced metabolic changes correlate with metformin- induc ed changes in markers of 
breast cancer risk or side effects.  In a cross -sectional fashion, we will explore the 
correlations between baseline metabolic features with breast density and circulating levels of hormones and cytokines.   
 
Exploratory objectives:  
To determine the effect of metformin intervention on tissue architecture as well as 
cellular and molecular targets in breast tissue collected in a subgroup of participants. T he tissue 
level information will also allow us to conduct correlative studies with our primary endpoint and 
secondary endpoints. These analyses will provide the much needed insight on the potential 
mechanisms of metformin action at the tissue level and aid in validating FWR -MRI and nipple 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_872481].  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1218811] cancer risk  
A recent report indicates that two- thirds of the U.S. adults are overweight or obese (1). 
High adiposity is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases, including type [ADDRESS_1218812] cancer 
(2-5). The increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women with high adiposity is likely to 
be attributed to multiple metabolic disturbances including altered circulating sex steroid 
hormones, hyperinsulinemic insulin resistance, altered expression and secretion of adipokines from adipose tissue, increased production of pro- inflammatory cytokines, and increased 
oxidative stress.  
 
  UA Project No. [PHONE_18068]  
                                                                                                                   Protocol Version 11, 10/4/[ADDRESS_1218813] cancer risk in women with high adiposity.  Metformin has been shown to reduce circulating insulin levels (reviewed by ( 6)), increase insulin- like growth factor 
binding protein (IGF -BP) 1 (7, 8) , decrease serum testosterone and androstenedione levels (9, 
10), and increase serum sex steroid binding globulin (9, 10)  in non- diabetic women with 
polycystic ovary syndrome (POS). Reduction in serum insulin levels was also observed in non-diabetic breast cancer patients with metformin treatment (11) .  In diabetics, metformin treatment 
resulted in favorable changes in circulating levels of leptin and adiponectin (12, 13) . 
Furthermore, studies have shown that metformin intervention resulted in weight reduction in overweight or obese patients without type 2 diabetes, although these trials were mostly small 
and of weak design and 
weight reduction was not observed in all studies (reviewed by 
(14)).  
 
In addition to the 
indirect effects, metformin may exert a 
direct effect in 
mammary tissue 
through the activation of the AMP -activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) 
signaling pathway, 
leading to an antiprolierative effect 
and induction of 
apoptosis (15-18). However, metformin is an organic cation at physiological pH. Its cellular 
uptake generally requires the presence of cell surface transporters. It is not known whether the human mammary tissue expresses the transporters for metformin to exert its direct effect.     
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_872482] (19,  20), including breast cancer ( 21-24).  Given the 
retrospective nature of these studies and the possibility that the comparison treatments (such as 
sulfonylureas or exogenous insulin) may increase risk, randomized, placebo- controlled 
intervention trials are clearly needed to assess the breast  cancer preventive activity of 
metformin. It is important to note that accumulating evidence suggests that type [ADDRESS_1218814] cancer (reviewed by (25) ). 
Therefore, metformin would have high potential for breast cancer risk reduction i n non -diabetics 
with high adiposity.  
 
Recent window -of-opportunity neoadjuvant trials reported clinical activity of metformin in 
non-diabetic women with operable invasive breast cancer after 2- 4 weeks of metformin. In two 
small non -placebo controlled trials, short -term metformin intervention prior to surgery resulted in 
decreased tumor cell proliferation (26, 27) . A considerably larger randomized, placebo-
controlled trial did not show an overall decrease in tumor cell proliferation after 4 weeks of 
metformin intervention (28) . However, subgroup analyses showed a decrease in tumor cell 
proliferation and serum insulin levels in women with high adiposity or insulin resistance,

(28).  
   
2.[ADDRESS_1218815] that metformin may only exert tumor suppressive effects in metabolic 
phenotypes of high adiposity and metabolic syndrome (28-30). We select to study 
premenopausal women over postmenopausal women because premenopausal women have a 
higher baseline breast density which may allow for more notable detection of  reduction in breast 
density  (primary study endpoint) . Cuzick and colleagues showed that 4.5 years of tamoxifen 
intervention was associated with a 13% absolute reduction in breast density among women 
aged 45 years or younger, compared with only 1% reduction among women older than 55 years 
(31).      
 
The primary study aim is to determine the metformin effect on the risk features of the 
breast by [CONTACT_872495].  While the specific relationship between breast density and breast cancer has not been established, breast density is one of the strongest and most consistent risk factors for breast cancer. Studies suggest that women with 
the dense tissue in more than 60- 75% of the breast are at 4-6- fold greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_872483] (32- 34). In addition, density in more than 50% of 
the breast could account for  about a third of breast cancer (reviewed by (35) ). The biological 
mechanism behind the association between breast density and breast cancer is not completely understood, but breast density may reflect the amount and proliferation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_872484] (reviewed by (36) ). 
Importantly, breast density is modifiable by [CONTACT_872496] (31, 37-
40). We hypothesize that metformin intervention would reduce breast density because 
metformin has been shown to decrease breast cell proliferation and modulate the IGF axi s (7, 8, 
26, 27)  and both of these have been associated with variation in breast density (41 -44).  In the 
proposed project, breast density will be assessed by [CONTACT_773274] -MRI, a novel, three- dimensional 
measure of breast density that will provide more sensitive and quantitative detection of changes 
in breast density than mammographic measure.  
 
The study will also determine whether the metformin intervention will result  in favorable 
changes in metabolic disturbances and anthropometric measures  in the study cohort. Favorable 
changes in these metabolic disturbances would provide clinical evidence for metformin in risk reduction for breast cancer and other chronic diseases.   In addition, we will explore the 
application of metabolomics as a systems biology approach to assess the chemopreventive 
mechanisms of metformin and to understand metabolic features affecting systemic and tissue markers of breast cancer risk.  
 Findings from this study will have wide public health impact because of the growing 
overweight and obese populations at risk for multiple diseases. With its demonstrated effect in 
reducing the incidence of diabetes in high risk adults (45) , metformin would have a high level of 
acceptance and uptake in at risk women with high adiposity if it has also been shown to exert favorable activities in breast cancer risk reduction. Importantly, a 10- year cost -effectiveness 
study showed that metformin is more cost -effective than life- style intervention for diabetes 
prevention (46) . Considering the challenges in maintaining a healthy life style by [CONTACT_872497], metformin could  be developed as an integrated pharmacological approach for at risk women 
with high adiposity for prevention of multiple diseases.

                                                                                                                   Protocol Version 11, 10/4/[ADDRESS_1218816] density suffer from well recognized limitations that reduce precision, reproducibility, sensitivity and accuracy (47, 48) .  Mammography also 
imparts ionization radiation to the breast.  Although added risk from repeated mammography is 
small for the general population (13 per 100,000), it is not insignificant (49) , and may be greater 
for women at risk for breast cancer.  Drs. Stopeck and Thompson (Co- Is) have conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_369518] [ADDRESS_1218817] agents. The study team has optimized data acquisition 
and image feature extraction (< 5 
min/scan) and demonstrated high reproducibility (r
2=0.997) of FWR -MRI 
applied to images of the breast. Figure 2 shows example images and FWR -
MRI histograms in relation to their 
corresponding BIRADS categories. 
Importantly, the study team has selected the fraction of voxels with more water than fat content (Fra50) as 
the pr imary measure of breast density derived from FWR -MRI which includes the area of the 
histogram with < 50% fat. The log(Fra50) measure of breast density produces results that are 
highly correlated with visualized % density as seen on standard mammography (Spearman rho 
= 0.946, p < 0.0001, Figure 3). The log(Fra50) is easily derived from FWR -MRI imaging, 
correlates strongly with mammography density and provides an optimized dynamic range for 
measuring small changes in density. FWR -MRI for breast density assessment has been  
implemented at UACC in two NCI -funded ongoing trials led by [CONTACT_24478]- Is. 
  Another  major strength of FWR -MRI over 
mammography lies in the number of non-
compressed images/segments that can be taken 
and used in the analysis, yielding a three dimensional image of the breast. This is 
especially relevant in our proposed cohort in 
accurate ass essment of breast density because 
a greater compressed breast thickness is expected in overweight and obese women than 
normal -weight women. FWR -MRI also allows 
dense areas to be located within the breast 
rather than seeing a single compressed 
measurement and can be re- assessed using 
shorter intervals at no risk or harm to the women 
on study.

globulin production by [CONTACT_3433] e liver (51, 52)  with a consequent elevation in bioavailable estradiol and 
stimulation of tumor cell proliferation.  Insulin can also induce aromatase activity (53), thus 
producing a further increase in estrogen biosynthesis.  A positive correlation between fasting serum insulin levels and breast cancer risk was observed in several studies (54 -56).  Metformin 
has been shown to reduce circulating insulin levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome 
(reviewed by (6) ) and in non- diabetic breast cancer patients (11) .   
 
Sex Steroid Hormones.   Breast cancer risk is also partially determined by [CONTACT_872499]- related factors. A large case- control study nested within the European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) showed that premenopausal women with 
elevated serum levels of testosterone or androstenedione had an increased risk of breast 
cancer (57) . The finding is consistent with observations from two other smaller prospective 
studies (58, 59) . Results on the relationship between breast cancer risk and pre- menopausal 
blood levels of estradiol are less consistent (57, 59 -61). Metformin has been shown to decrease 
serum testosterone and androstenedione levels (9, 10)  and increase serum sex steroid binding 
globulin (9, 10)  in women with polycystic ovary  syndrome.  
 
Insulin -like Growth Factor Axis . Insulin -like growth factors [ADDRESS_1218822] potent stimulators of cell proliferation and differentiation in humans.  Their bioavailability is regulated by a family of IGF binding proteins (IGF -BP), which can bind and inactivate IGFs but 
also increase their activity under specific conditions. IGF -BP3 binds approximately 75- 90% of 
circulating IGF -[ADDRESS_1218823] important determinant of IGF bioavailability 
(62).  These systemic hormones are expressed in most tissues including the breast and are 
locally acting growth factors with paracrine and autocrine functions. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_872485] -[ADDRESS_1218824] cancer in premenopausal women (63 -65).  
Metformin has been shown to increase IGF -BP1 but have no effect on IG F-1 in women with 
polycystic ovary syndrome (7, 8) .   
 Adipokines . Leptin and adiponectin are adipokines produced predominantly or 
exclusively by [CONTACT_872500].  A number of studies have shown that low serum adiponectin levels and high serum leptin levels are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (66 -70), although some studies found no association between circulating leptin 
level and breast cancer risk (71 -73).  Nevertheless, studies have shown that leptin 
measurement is more sensitive to a number of variables related to specimen collection (74, 75) . 
The circulating leptin concentration is directly proportional to the degree of adiposity (76) .  In 
addition, serum leptin levels are 2- 3 times higher in women than in men after adjusted for age 
and BMI (77) .  Leptin is a mitogen for various cell types including normal and transformed 
breast epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (78, 79) .  Leptin has been shown to induce proliferation (80 -82), increase 
the expression of proteolytic enzymes that are essential in metastatic process (83) , and 
stimulate angiogenesis (84, 85) .  In addition, leptin interferes with insul in signaling, and insulin 
resistance syndrome is accompanied by [CONTACT_872501], which allows for excessive endocrine activity of these proteins at target sites (86 -88).  In contrast to 
leptin, there is an inverse relationship between the plasma a diponectin concentration and body 
fat mass (89, 90) .  Its production in adipose tissue is suppressed in the insulin resistance 
syndrome and obesity with consequent hypoadiponectinaemia (91) .  Adiponectin has been 
shown to suppress proliferation of human breast cancer cells (82, 92, 93) .  It was also reported 
to suppress angiogenesis by a process which involves activation of members of the caspase

 group of apoptotic factors (94).  In diabetics, metformin treatment resulted in favorable changes 
in circulating levels of leptin and adiponectin (12, 13) .  
 
Anthropometric Measures . Studies suggested that weight reduction reduces risk of 
postmenopausal breast cancer.  For example, in the Iowa Women’s Health Study, women who 
lost >5% of their body weight before menopause had 40% fewer breast cancers in the 
postmenopausal period compared with women who continued to gain weight (95) . In addition to 
weight gain, body fat distribution has also been suggested to play a role in the risk of breast 
cancer. Positive association between central adiposity and breast cancer risk was observed in 
some studies (96 -99). Studies have shown that metformin intervention resulted in weight 
reduction and decreased waist circumference in overweight or obese individuals without type 2 
diabetes, although these trials were small and of weak design (reviewed by (14) ).   
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1218825] density and circulating levels of hormones and cytokines.  
  
Metabolomics is a comprehensive analysis of metabolite levels in whole organisms and 
the investigation of how stimuli such as diet, lifestyle, environment, genetic effects, and pharmaceutical interventions influence the metabolite levels (100) . Metformin has demonstrated 
diverse biological activities in different cells/tissues. Application of metabolomics to this project 
would represent a systems biology approach to understand the mechanisms for metformin-
associated changes in markers of breast cancer risk or adverse effects in healthy 
overweight/obese women. A recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_872486] 15 type 2 diabetic patients 
showed that treatment with metformin for 3 months resulted in changes in a number of endogenous metabolites (101) . In addition to its effects on glucose and lipoprotein metabolism 
pathways, metformin also modulated bacteria and nutrition metabolism (101) .  
 For the proposed project, we also plan to explore the metabol omic  profiles in NAF. NAF 
contain breast epi[INVESTIGATOR_872487]. It can be collected noninvasively, inexpensively, and repeatedly with minimal or no discomfort. We have had extensive experience in NAF collection and 
determination of biomarkers in NAF in early phase clinical trials. We have shown a reduction in 
prostaglandin E
[ADDRESS_1218826] 
cancer risk (102) . In our recently 
completed study, we found that 
menopausal status significantly 
affected expression of certain proteins 
in NAF but the effect is less notable in plasma (see Table 1), suggesting that 
NAF biomarkers may provide 
information about the breast microenvironment that might  not be 
reflected in plasma.

These analyses will provide much needed insight on the potential mechanisms of 
metformin action at the tissue level and aid in validating FWR -MRI and NAF  as surrogate

The ongoing sulindac/AI trial (IRB#12 -0080 -04) led by [CONTACT_6283].  Stopeck and Thompson has 
established the infrastructure for performing ultrasound- guided core needle biopsy for clinical 
research.  Currently, 100% of enrolled participants have consented to undergo the optional core 
needle biopsy procedures and have found the procedure acceptable and relatively pain- free.  All 
have tentatively agreed to undergo a second procedure for breast tissue procurement as well. We plan to adapt the experience gained from the sulindac/AI trial to facilitate the collection of breast tissue in the metformin study. We conservatively estimate that 50% of women will 
consent to provide core biopsy specimens.    
 
3. SUMMARY OF STUDY PLAN  
  
This is a Phase II double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trial of metformin to 
determine its potential effects on recognized and putative markers of breast cancer risk in 
overweight or obese premenopausal women who have metabolic syndrome.  The study 
endpoints are modulation of breast density and metabolic disturbances, risk factors associated 
with breast cancer.  In addition, the study will explore the application of metabolomics as a systems biology approach to assess the chemopreventive mechanisms of metformin and t o 
understand factors affecting markers of breast cancer risk. The study will also explore  the effect 
of metformin intervention on tissue architecture as well as cellular and molecular targets in breast tissue collected in a subgroup of participants . 
 
At the consenting/screening  visit, participants  will sign informed consent and undergo 
the following procedures for screening: collection of medical history and medication usage 
history, demographic information (age, race/ethnicity), anthropometric measurements (weight 
(wt), height, waist circumference, waist -hip ratio), breast cancer risk information (family and 
personal history of breast cancer, age at menarche, parity, and prior breast biopsy), information 
on menstrual patterns/ cycles, and a fasting bloo d sample for complete blood count with 
differential (CBC/w diff)  and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).   
 Participants who meet all selection criteria will return in the midluteal phase of the 
menstrual cycle , when  feasible,  to undergo baseline evaluation including collection of a fasting 
blood for research biomarkers , collection of NAF for metabolomic analysis, MRI assessment of 
breast density, collection of wt, waist circumference, and waist -hip ratio measurements , and the 
optional core needle biopsy for breast tissue collection. Women who cannot fit into the MRI 
scanner due to the large body size will continue the study and undergo all other study procedures . Participants will also complete the Arizona Food Frequency Questionnaire (AFFQ) 
to measure us ual dietary intake and the Arizona Activity Frequency Questionnaire (AAFQ) to 
assess usual physical activity.    
 Following completion of baseline evaluation, participants will be randomized to receive 
metformin or placebo for 12 months.  We plan to randomize 150 eligible participants  (75 per 
arm).  With an anticipated attrition rate of 20% or less, we expect to have at least [ADDRESS_1218831] No. [PHONE_18068]  
                                                                                                                   Protocol Version 11, 10/4/[ADDRESS_1218832] four weeks, then two  850 mg metformin or two  
placebo tablet s daily with meals for the remainder of the study. The same starting dose and 
gradual dose escalation up to 2,000 mg per day is used to minimize gastrointestinal sympt oms 
for glycemic control in diabetics (GLUCOPHAGE  prescribing information).  
 
Participants will be asked to keep an adverse event diary and menstrual calendar 
throughout the study.  In addition, participants will be provided with an intake calendar for 
recording medication usage. Study personnel will contact [CONTACT_872502] a  week after 
study agent has been initiated and within a  week following scheduled dose increase to assess 
compliance and any potential problems.  Participants will return to the clinic at months 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1218833]  if MRI was performed at 
the baseline visit . Participants will also complete the AFFQ and AAFQ to assess any changes in 
dietary intake and physical activity during the intervention.  Following the study intervention, 
participants will be followed for 2 weeks for any adverse reactions.

  UA Project No. [PHONE_18068]  
                                                                                                                   Protocol Version 11, 10/4/2016 
 
10 
 • Tablets should be taken with food, preferably with the evening meal . 
• Tablets should be swallowed with a full 8 oz glass of water . 
 
 5.3. Contraindications  
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with  
• Renal disease or renal dysfunction  
• Known hypersensitivity to metformin hydrochloride  
• Acute  or chronic metabolic acidosis  
• Hepatic impairment, as defined in the exclusion criteria  
 Because use of iodinated contrast materials may result in acute alteration of renal 
function and ha ve been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin , patients 
who plan to undergo radiologic studies involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials will not be permitted to begin study medication until at least 48 hours following the procedure and only after renal function has been re- evaluated and found to be 
normal  (serum creatinine < 1.4 mg/dL) .  
 
5.4 Concomitant Medications  
Participants may not use non- study metformin or other biguanides while on study.  
 Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, 
cimetidine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) have the potential for 
interaction with metformin by [CONTACT_872503]. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via  the proximal renal tubular secretory system.   
 All medications (prescription and over -the-counter), vitamin and mineral supplements, 
and/or herbs taken by [CONTACT_872504]: 1) start and stop date, dose and route of administration, and indication. 
Medications taken for a procedure (e.g., biopsy) should also be included.  
 
If a subject requires a radiologic exam  involving intravascular administration of iodinated 
contrast materials  while participating in the study, she must discontinue study agent for at least 
[ADDRESS_1218837] 48 hours following the procedure and only after renal function has been re- evaluated and 
found to be normal  (serum creatinine < 1.4 mg/dL).

 be held.   Study drug will be reintroduced at 50% dose ( 1 tablet of 850 mg metfor min or placebo 
daily) when the adverse event resolves to Grade 1 or below within 2 weeks.   If the Grade 2 
event does not resolve to Grade 1 or below within 2 weeks, participants will be removed from 
the study and followed for resolution of the adverse event. After reinstituti on of 50% dose ( 1 
tablet of 850 mg metformin or placebo daily) for a minimum of 2 weeks, the full dose ( 2 tablets 
of 850 mg metformin or placebo daily ) may be reintroduced at the discretion of the study 
physician . If the Grade 2 adverse event recurs and pe rsists for more than three days following 
reinstitution of the full dose and is considered definitely, probably or possibly related to study 
agent, the study agent will be held and reintroduced at 50% dose ( 1 tablet of 850 mg metformin 
or placebo daily ) if the adverse event resolves to Grade [ADDRESS_1218839] udy and 
followed for resolution of the adverse event.   If participants do not wish to be re- challenged with 
the full dose, they may remain on study at 50% dose.  
 
For Grade [ADDRESS_1218840] widely used oral antihyperglycemic drugs in the management of type 2 diabet es. It has 
been used worldwide for over 40 years to treat type 2 diabetes, and was approved in the United 
States (US) by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) as an antidiabetic in 1995 (104) . It is 
also used off -label for polycystic ovary syndrome and metabolic syndrome. The major 
mechanism of metformin action in vivo  involves suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis and 
glucose output, which is associated with a decline in circulating glucose concentration and a 
secondar y decline in insulin levels (105) .  
 
Beneficial effects have also been observed in non -diabetics, including treatment of 
weight gain induced by [CONTACT_872505] (106) , polycystic ovary syndrome (6) , 
nonalcoholic fatty liver (107)  and diabetes prevention in high- risk subjects (108) . It has a 
demonstrated safety profile and g ood tolerability in both diabetics and non- diabetics.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1218841] a favorable safety profile in diabetes patients (109) . In a 
US double -blind clinical trial for patients with type 2 diabetes (metformin n=141; placebo n=145), 
gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea (53.2% vs. 11.7% placebo), nausea and vomiting (25.5% vs. 8.3% placebo), abdominal discomfort (6.4% vs. 4.8 % placebo), flatulence (12.1% vs. 
5.5% placebo), indigestion (7.1% vs . 4.1% placebo), and asthenia (9.2% vs . 5.5% placebo) 
were the most common reactions to the drug. These symptoms were dose- dependent,

 transient, and resolved spontaneously with continued use (Glucophage  (metformin 
hydrochloride tablets) label information). Diarrhea led to discontinuation of medication in 6% of 
subjects treated with metformin hydrochloride. Additional adverse reactions were reported in 1% 
to 5% of subjects receiving active  drug; those more commonly reported than in the placebo 
group include abnormal stools, hypoglycemia, myalgia, lightheaded, dyspnea, nail disorder, 
rash, increased sweating, taste disorder, chest discomfort, chills, flu syndrome, flushing and 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332] (G lucophage  (metformin hydrochloride tablets) label information).  
 
A recently published multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled trial in patients with 
type 2 diabetes reported on vitamin B 12 deficiency with long -term metformin treatment. 
Compared with placebo, metformin treatment was associated with a mean decrease in vitamin 
B12 concentration of ~19% (95% confidence interval (CI) – 24% to – 14%; p<0.001). The absolute 
risk of vitamin B 12 deficiency (<150 pM) at study end was 7.2 percentage points higher in the 
metformin group than in the placebo group (95% CI 2.3 to 12.1; p=0.004) (110) .  
 
According to the package insert, lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic 
complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin 
hydrochloride. When it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of the cases.  Lactic acidosis may 
also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by [CONTACT_381356]  (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte 
disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. Metformin plasma levels >5 μg/mL are generally found when metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis.  
 
Reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is 
very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient -years, with approximately 0.015 fatal 
cases/1000 patient -years). In more than 20,[ADDRESS_1218842] occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, and in those with multiple co ncomitant medical/surgical problems and who 
take multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure require pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion  and hypoxemia and increased risk of lactic acidosis 
(Glucophage  (metformin hydrochloride tablets) label information.  
 
The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and patient age. 
Drug should be withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function can significantly impair the ability to 
clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory 
evidence of hepatic disease. Alcohol can potentiate the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. Drug treatment should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (111) . The onset of lactic acidosis is often 
subtle, and accompanied by [CONTACT_872506], myalgia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis 
(Glucophage  (metformin hydrochloride tablets) label information).  
 
In support of the previously reported low risk of lactic acidosis, a recently published 
systematic review assessed the risk with metformin use in type [ADDRESS_1218843] No. [PHONE_18068]  
                                                                                                                   Protocol Version 11, 10/4/2016 
 
13 
 with an increased risk of lactic acidosis compared to other antihyperglycemic treatments (112, 
113). 
 
Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either type 2 diabetes 
patients or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia (109) . 
 
Carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and 
mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 
1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. Both doses are approximately four times the maximum 
recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area. No evidence of 
carcinogenicity was found in either male or female mice or in male rats. There was, however, an 
increased incidence of benign stromal ut erine polyps in female rats at 900 mg/kg/day (109) . 
Metformi n was not mutagenic in the Ames, mouse lymphoma, human lymphocyte chromosome 
aberration, or mouse micronucleus tests (109) .  
 
The fertility of male and female rats was unaffected by [CONTACT_872507] 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the recommended human 
daily dose based on body surface area (109) . 
 
6.3   Source of Study Agent  
Metformin tablets, 850 mg will be purchased from a commercial source through the 
University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) Research Pharmacy. We will contract with Pharm Ops, Inc (Phillipsburg, NJ) to manufacture a clinical supply of the placebo tablets  using inert 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . Pharm Ops, Inc. has manufactured placebo products for a number of NCI -sponsored 
chemoprevention trials.  
 6.4 Agent Storage and Distribution  
Metformin and placebo tablets will be stored in the UACC Research Pharmacy at room 
temperature [20- 25°C] and protected from environmental extreme. It will be dispensed to the 
study staff in light -resistant containers for distribution to the study participants.  
 
6.5 Registration/Randomization 
Subjects will be considered registered on the date they sign the approved informed 
consent document with a member of the study staff.  Randomization will be performed using computer -generated random permuted blocks.

7.2  Consenting/Screening  
Potential subjects will present to clinic for a detailed discussion of the protocol with the 
study coordinator.  Signed informed consent will be obtained prior to any study -related activities 
or procedures being conducted.  Subjects are registered onto the protocol on the day of 
consent.  P articipants will then  undergo the following procedures for screening . 
• Review  of medical history and medication usage history  
• Collection of demographic information (age, race/ethnicity) .  
• Collection of anthropometric measurements (weight (wt), height, wais t 
circumference, waist -hip ratio) . Body weight will be measured with participants 
standing on a calibrated scale with minimal movement with hands by [CONTACT_872508].  Waist and hip circumference will be measured 
in a standing position with a flexible tape. Waist circumference will be measured at the midpoint between the lowest rib and the top of the iliac crest on the bare abdomen. Participants will be asked to relax and exhale for the measurement. Hip 
circumference will be measured at the level of the greatest protrusion of the gluteal 
muscles, with minimal clothing. Participants will be asked to stand with their weight 
evenly distributed on both feet and legs slightly parted, making sure not tense the 
gluteal muscles.  When  recording the measurement, the study personnel will ensure 
that the tape is not too tight or too loose, is lying flat on the skin, and is hor izontal.  
• Collection of breast cancer risk information (family and personal history of breast 
cancer, age at menar che, parity, and prior breast biopsy) .  
• Collection of information on menstrual patterns/ cycles.  
• Measures of vital signs ( temperature, blood pressure and pulse). 
• A fasting blood sample for complete blood count with differential (CBC/w diff) , 
comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) , lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , and follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) 
and/or estradiol for women with uncertain menopausal status . The screening blood 
work may be repeated, if clinically indicated.  
• Urine pregnancy test .  
 7.3 Evaluations During Study Intervention  
Participants who meet all selection criteria will undergo the following baseline 
procedures. When feasible, these procedures will be scheduled in the midluteal phase of the 
menstrual cycle .  
 
• Anthropometric measurements including wt, waist circumference, waist -hip ratio . 
• A fasting blood for research biomarkers .   
• Collection of  urine for urine pregnancy test  and research tests .  
• Vital signs .

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1218858] density as measured by 
[CONTACT_773274] -MRI (when measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months) between metformin and placebo 
groups. Additional endpoints such as syst emic hormone and cytokines, body weight, waist 
circumference, and waist -hip ratio will be measured at baseline, [ADDRESS_1218859] f or the correlation among measurements within the same woman. The main 
effects in the model will be time (0, 6, 12), treatment group (metformin versus placebo), and the interaction between time and treatment group. The time parameter tests if there is a change among placebo treated women, while the group- by-time interaction tests if the change in 
metformin treated women differs from that in the placebo group. We expect that a simpler covariance structure, such as compound symmetry, will be adequate for repea ted 
measurements within the same woman (since the measurements are equally spaced). Alternatively, we will compare correlation structures for the longitudinal measurements using 
Akaike’s information criterion.   All endpoints will be first assessed for normality, and 
transformations (such as a logarithmic transformation) will be used as necessary to reduce 
skewness prior to statistical analysis.   
 Secondary analyses will assess whether differences in the changes in FWR -MRI 
between the metformin and placebo groups remain after adjustment for potential explanatory 
variables, such as changes in body weight, systemic hormones, and cytokines.  These 
explanatory variables will be added as independent predictors in the linear mixed- effects 
models.  These analyses will be restricted to explanatory variables that have demonstrated statistically significant metformin effects across time.  
 For the metabolomic aim, pre- to post -intervention changes in all detectable compounds 
of known identify (currently comprising [ADDRESS_1218860] platforms offered 
by [CONTACT_299142], Inc) will be determined and compared between treatment groups using a two-
sample t -test. An estimate of the false discovery rate ( q-value) will be calculated (115)  to take 
into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic -based studies. A low 
q-value ( q≤0.10) is an indication of high confidence in a result. While a higher q-value indicates 
diminished confidence, it does not necessarily rule out the significance of a result. Other lines of 
evidence may be taken into consideration when determining whether a result merits further 
scrutiny.  Such evidence may include a) significance in another dimension of the study, b) inclusion in a common pathway with a highly significant compound, or c) residing in a similar 
functional biochemical family with other significant compounds.   
 
Exploratory analyses will assess whether the observed metformin -induced changes in 
metabolite features are correlated with changes in FWR -MRI, body weight/composition, 
systemic hormones, and cytokines. The correlation will be estimated using a Pearson correlation coefficient. It is expected that any changes  in these variables in the placebo group 
will reflect random variation only.  Thus, these analyses will be restricted to the metformin group 
to overcome dilution of the potential correlations by [CONTACT_872512].   
 
Exploratory analyses als o will explore the correlation between baseline metabolite 
features and FWR -MRI, systemic hormones, and cytokines.  These analyses will be restricted to 
  UA Project No. [PHONE_18068]  
                                                                                                                   Protocol Version 11, 10/4/[ADDRESS_1218861] all primary specific aims. We assume 
an initial sample size of 75 women per arm and allow the possibility of up to 20% dropout for the 12-month follow -up measurement. This results in at least 60 evaluable women per group. To 
justify the sample size, we use the simplified comparison of change between 12 months versus 
baseline (ignoring the 6 month measurement).  For the FWR -MRI-derived change in breast 
density, we will b e able to detect a decrease of 0.[ADDRESS_1218862] deviation (SD) units in the 
metformin treated women with 80% statistical power, assuming a two- sided α of 0.05. To 
estimate what this change would be in relation to breast density, we used the relationship 
betw een breast density and log(Fra50) based on our previous data.  Based on an analysis of 
our cross -sectional data, the estimated SD of log(Fra50) is 2.40. Thus, a decrease of 0.516 SD 
units corresponds to a change of - 1.2384 ( -0.516*2.40). Based on the regression line, this is 
equivalent to a 10% decrease in breast density as determined by [CONTACT_872513]. For 
the additional primary outcomes (such as systemic hormones, cytokines, and weight), we will be 
able to detect a difference of 0.516 SD units with 80% statistical power, assuming a sample size 
of 60 evaluable women per group.  Based on our previous experience, we anticipate that 65% of the proposed cohort will provide sufficient NAF for metabolomic analysis, which results in 39 
women per group (allowing for up to 20% drop- out).  This will allow us to detect a difference of 
0.643 SD units with 80% statistical power.  
 9.3 Interim Analysis 
No formal interim statistical analyses are planned for this Phase II trial. Accrual, data 
collection, and any adverse events will be monitored on a regular basis.

11. Description and Reporting of Adv erse Events  
 
11.1   Adver se Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant.  An 
AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or study participant.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (includi ng a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with participation in a 
study, whether or not related to that participation.  This includes all deaths that occur while a 
participant is on a study.  
 
A list  of adverse events that have occurred or might occur (Reported Adverse Events 
and Potential Risks) can be found in Section 6.2, Pharmaceutical Information as well as the package insert.    
All adverse events that occur after the informed consent is signed must be recorded 
whether or not related to study agent.  All adverse events will be entered into the OnCore 
database.  
 AE Data Elements include:  
• AE reported date  
• AE Verbatim Term 
• Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) AE term  
• Event onset date and event ended date  
• Severity grade  
• Attribution to study agent (relatedness)  
• Whether or not the event was reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
• Whether or not the subject dropped due to the event  
• Action taken with the study agent  
• Outcome of the  event  
• Comments  
 
  UA Project No. [PHONE_18068]  
                                                                                                                   Protocol Version 11, 10/4/2016 
 
23 
 All AEs will be assessed according CTCAE Version 4 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronicapplications/docs/ctcaev4.pdf ).  
 
AEs that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the 
general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4.0 as stated below.  
 
  
Grade  Severity  Description  
1 Mild Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or 
diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated;  
limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
3 Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening;  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872490]; disabling; limiting self care ADL**.  
4 Life threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated.  
5 Fatal  Death related to AE.  
   
 Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking  medications, and not bedridden.  
 
The possibility that the adverse event is related to study agent will be classified as one of 
the following:  not related, unlikely, possible, probable, definite.  
  
All AEs, including lab abnormalities that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_581094], will be followed according to good medical practices and documented as such.  
 
11.2  Serious Adverse Events  
ICH Guideline E2A and Fed. Reg. 75,Sept. 29, 2010 define serious adverse events as 
those events, occurring at any dose, which meet any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening ( Note: the term life- threatening refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
 
Note : A SAE may also be an important medical event, in the view of the investigator that 
requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

24 
 All serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, and any deaths will be reported 
within 24 hours of notification of the event to the DSMB Coordinator. All SAEs which meet the 
criteria for a reportable event , as defined below,  will be reported to the University of Arizona 
Human Subjects Protection Program (HSPP) within [ADDRESS_1218864] meet all three of the following criteria:  
• Unanticipated or unexpected in nature, frequency or severity, AN D 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (there is a reasonable 
possibility that it is related), AND  
• The event suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of 
harm than was previously known or recognized (not already referenced in existing 
study documents, such as the protocol, consent form or package insert ). 
 
All serious ad verse events will be processed by [CONTACT_872514], every six months. The DSMB coordinator will review the SAE reporting process to confirm reporting requirements are met.   
 
11.3  Plan for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance   
Routine study activity and safety information will be reported to the DSMB every six 
months, or more frequently if requested. These reports will include:  
 
• Study activity, cumulative and for the period under review;  
• Safety (narrative description on non- serious and serious adverse events);  
• Predetermined protocol early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89020]/futility;    
• Monitoring and protocol compliance;  
• Comments ; 
• Attachments (AE data reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_89021], SAE letters and reports, results of any review(s), applicable correspondence 
with the HSPP  or other regulatory agencies ).

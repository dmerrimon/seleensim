All participants will receive a core 6-month weight loss texting intervention (based on our iOTA approach) that includes tailored behavior change goals, interactive self-monitoring, automated feedback, and skills training. We will use a full factorial design to randomize participants to experimental conditions that reflect the texting intervention components: motivational messaging (self- vs expert-generated), texting frequency (daily vs weekly), reminders (one reminder v. multiple reminders), feedback type (summary score v. specific feedback) and comparison unit (to self v. to a group of people). The full factorial design is power efficient, logistically feasible (because we manipulate conditions using technology) and will allow us to examine the most important main and interaction effects among components. Our primary outcome will be absolute change in weight from baseline to 6 months. We will estimate the main effects and 10 pairwise interactions of each of the five components on the outcome at each follow-up time point using a linear mixed effects model. The model will include fixed effects for: time point (baseline, 3- or 6-months), component (motivational messaging, frequency, reminders, feedback type, and comparison unit), pairwise interactions of each component and the time-by-component and time-by-pairwise interactions.   Background: More than 69% of U.S. adults are currently overweight or obese; 35% are obese.2,3 Obesity continues to increase for all men and for Black and Hispanic women.46 The rapid rise in severe obesity is especially troubling. Obesity heightens risk for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and insulin resistance.710 It also drives premature mortality and U.S. health system spending.1113 Traditional behavioral weight loss treatments  usually including frequent interactions with a trained counselor and regular self-monitoring of diet/exercise  produces 7-10% weight loss after 6-[ADDRESS_803489] been fully standalone (i.e., delivered entirely via texting). Standalone approaches have great population-level potential because they are low cost, highly scalable, and modular in nature. They can reach into broad, diverse, and geographically dispersed populations that do not have stable access to other approaches (e.g., counseling, web, email, video) frequently employed in mHealth weight loss trials. Efficacious texting approaches could also be employed in multicomponent treatments to enhance outcomes. If we could improve the outcomes of standalone texting interventions, we might make major population-level impact. However, it is challenging to move the science forward because texting intervention designs have varied considerably. This study is designed to remedy this omission. We will use the MOST framework to develop an optimized treatment package that will deliver the most effective 6-month standalone texting intervention for weight loss.  
  
Protocol renewal approved by [CONTACT_606472]:  7/21/2021  Page 2  Experimental Trial Overview: We propose to conduct a 6-month full factorial trial with up to 700 adults with obesity. All participants will receive a core 6-month weight loss texting intervention (based on our iOTA approach). Consistent with the MOST framework, we will randomize participants to one of [ADDRESS_803490] the intervention components we identified in phase 1. The components and their levels include: motivational messaging (self- vs expert-generated), texting frequency (daily vs weekly), reminders (one reminder v. multiple reminders), feedback type (summary score v. specific feedback) and comparison unit (to self v. to a group of people). We will collect follow-up measures at months 3, 6, and 12 months.  Design rationale: Two considerations are important when choosing an experimental design for a MOST trial. First, it should allow us to estimate the independent effects of a component on our outcome. Second, it must be economical, in terms of its actual cost and utilization of resources.[ADDRESS_803491] of texting frequency, we compare the mean of conditions with a weekly (conditions 1-16) to the mean of the conditions in which frequency is daily (conditions 17-32). Similarly, we compare the mean of conditions receiving self-generated motivational messages (1-8; 17-24) to those with expert-generated motivational messages (9-16; 25-32) to examine the main effect of motivational messaging. A similar process is used to test interactions. Condition  Frequency  Motivational

Goal  Group    Intervention design: At baseline, we will randomize participants to one of the 32 experimental conditions (see Table 2). Each participant will receive the core weight loss intervention, based on our iOTA approach.  iOTA  the interactive obesity treatment approach (iOTA): iOTA is an approach that we developed and have used in several recent obesity treatment trials.43,55,56,[ADDRESS_803492] and does not require expert knowledge or expensive resources. From the participant perspective, s/he simply takes a short survey and is immediately assigned a set of personally-
  
Protocol renewal approved by [CONTACT_606472]:  7/21/[ADDRESS_803493] motivational messages to support that can be easily disseminated. For this reason, several research groups are testing iOTA in a range of populations.  Theoretical framework: All core iOTA intervention components are designed to target self-efficacy, which we selected from social cognitive theory (SCT),59,60 given its consistent association with weight loss outcomes.6163 Bandura identified 4 primary factors64 that influence self-efficacy: mastery experiences, social modeling, social persuasion, and somatic and emotional reactions. These are noted in Table 3, along with details about the core iOTA intervention address each component. SCT also indicates that behavior change can be facilitated through a number of self-regulatory processes, including self-monitoring,6567 goal setting,31,63 and social support.68,69 The intervention will support these self-regulatory processes, further heightening self-efficacy. Our conceptual framework integrates TAM and self-efficacy. The intervention will target self-efficacy. Our experimental components were selected to increase perceived usefulness and ease of use, with the goal of enhancing intervention engagement, given its importance in driving weight loss.16 
  Obesogenic behavior change goals: Participants track [ADDRESS_803494] been selected based on their: 1) empi[INVESTIGATOR_205552]; 2) population relevance; 3) ease of self-monitoring; and 4) concreteness. We will leverage the goal library that was deemed efficacious in our previous studies, Shape (Protocol 

  
Protocol renewal approved by [CONTACT_606472]:  7/21/2021  Page 5  2938) and Track (Protocol B0033) (See Appendix F). During study startup, we will make efforts to identify population-relevant goals that might be missing from our library.  Self-monitoring and tailored feedback: Regular self-monitoring is a robust predictor of weight loss, although adherence typi[INVESTIGATOR_606461].65,67,[ADDRESS_803495] participants either daily or 3 times weekly. An outbound text requests self-monitoring data. Participants then text their self-monitoring data. We immediately provide tailored, real-time feedback on participant's progress via text. Feedback considers both short- and long-term progress. We also provide skills training tips, tailored to a part A sample self-monitoring exchange can be found in Appendix G.   Tailored skills training videos: We have skills training videos (2-5 min) for each of the goals in our library. For example, for those assigned a fast food reduction goal, we provide skills training materials on eating out, social eating, and lunch packing. We also have a larger library of general behavior change lessons (e.g., stimulus control, problem solving, social cues, stress management). Our materials include tailored narratives, and information about cost and community resources. We use expectancy priming throughout to heighten salience of materials.[ADDRESS_803496] implemented with success in Track and send links to videos presented on responsive websites like a private channel on YouTube.com.   Motivational messages: We will send motivational messages on 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day. For participants randomized to the expert condition, we will send texts from our extensive library of motivational messages. Each is designed to enhance motivation for behavior change and heighten self-efficacy for the assigned set of behavior change goals. To prevent habituation, the messages do not repeat in 30-day cycles. Participants randomized to the self-generated condition will create text messages in two areas at baseline: reasons and competence for weight loss. The former will target autonomous self-regulation (i.e., change stems from within), while the latter targets efficacy for weight-related behavior change. We will send texts from these pools randomly. Every two weeks, we will give participants the opportunity to create new messages. We will do this for several reasons. First, participants may think of new messages as they engage in behavior change. Second, the creation and receipt of new messages may promote intervention engagement. Finally, crafting new messages can increase their sense of autonomy and competence. A sample motivational message from our library can be found in Appendix G.   Study start-up: During the first [ADDRESS_803497] extensive experience with software engineering and will use the resources of the Duke Global Digital Health Science Center (led by [INVESTIGATOR_124].

These participants will complete all measures and in-person visits as all other participants, but their data will not be included in our study analysis. The rationale is that programming issues or bugs arise every time a new programming component (new goals, survey changes, software updates) is introduced. By [CONTACT_606473][INVESTIGATOR_606463], we can catch these issues before they affect our intervention.    Data collection: Research data will be collected from several sources.

All research staff are required to have human subjects training. All gathered data will be used specifically for research purposes.  As part of enrollment, participants will self-report baseline age, gender, race/ethnicity, health insurance, education, income, employment, health status, marital status, health literacy/numeracy,85 and smartphone/texting history via a Qualtrics survey.17 Additional measures by [CONTACT_606474] 4.

For each, we will define the week of nonuse as the week in which all intervention participation ceased, and the participant did not return to the intervention.   Baseline Enrollment Survey: Participants who express interest in Charge will be asked to take a series of Qualtrics surveys before coming in for a baseline visit. First, participants will take a short eligibility screener. Eligible participants will go through the informed consent process via Qualtrics and to sign an electronic informed consent form. Participants who sign the informed consent will be asked to fill out baseline surveys and the iOTA goal assignment survey. This survey was tested prior to implementation via mTurk to ensure they are not burdensome (pi[INVESTIGATOR_606464]).   Baseline Evaluation Visit: At the baseline evaluation visit, study staff will collect written informed consent, administer the motivational message survey (if applicable based on condition), and confirm participant eligibility. This will be followed by [CONTACT_606475]. Participants will be reimbursed for their time at baseline visits. We will randomize participants at the baseline visit. Randomization sequences will be generated by a computer algorithm using a covariate adaptive randomization method, in which group assignment will be informed by [CONTACT_606476]/ethnicity and gender in the previously assigned participants. This method minimizes imbalance between groups for these characteristics, even in a small sample where the risk of imbalance is high and when the exact composition of the sample is not known a priori. Due to the nature of the interventions, it will be difficult to completely blind staff collecting data to treatment assignment. However, we will ensure that different study staff collect follow-up data and we will take all possible steps to blind those data collection staff to treatment assignment. Outcomes will be analyzed blind to allocation status.  Follow-up Data Collection: In addition to the baseline visit, trained study staff will also collect anthropometric data, specifically weight, at subsequent follow-up visits at 3, [ADDRESS_803504] social, psychosocial, and health status data, including data on sociodemographics, physical activity, dietary patterns, self-efficacy, and depression.

Protocol renewal approved by [CONTACT_606472]:  7/21/[ADDRESS_803505] Selection   Inclusion Criteria: The study involves males and females aged 18-[ADDRESS_803506] English language proficiency, and a BMI above 25 kg/m2. Participants will own a smartphone and be willing to receive multiple text messages daily.   Exclusion Criteria: Participants will be excluded from the study under the following conditions: prior or planned bariatric surgery; psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396279] 12 months; pregnancy, nursing, or planned pregnancy; history of a cardiovascular event; history of an eating disorder; history of a condition (e.g., end stage renal disease, cancer, schizophrenia) or use of medications (e.g., lithium, steroids, anti-psychotics) that would affect weight measurement, for which weight loss is contraindicated, or might promote weight change; current participation in a weight loss trial and/or recent weight loss > 10%; investigator discretion for safety reasons.  Sample size: We will recruit up to [ADDRESS_803507] English language proficiency, and a BMI above 25 kg/m2. We will recruit a sample that is 30% male and 40% racial/ethnic minority (similar to the demographics of Durham, N.C.). We will waitlist participants if needed in order to reach our target recruitment percentages for males and minorities.   Using the FactorialPowerPlan SAS Macro, developed by [CONTACT_606477], we computed the sample size needed for a full [ADDRESS_803508] deviation estimate from a recent weight loss trial90 of 5 kg, and a within-participant correlation of 0.9, this translates into a 0.75 kg difference in weight loss at 6 months between groups given an intervention component and those groups without the intervention component (main effects). We determined that a total sample size of 282 subjects would be required to achieve an overall power of 80% to detect a 0.75 kg difference in weight loss. We conservatively assume 30% dropout at 6 months, so we inflate the sample size to 403. To obtain an equal number of participants in each treatment combination (condition), we further inflate this sample size to up to 700, which is a final sample of 14 participants in each of the 32 conditions.   The main effects are then estimated with 224 participants receiving either level of each component. Likewise, pairwise interactions are based on comparisons of means for 224 participants who receive both or neither component compared to those who received only one.  Recruitment: We will recruit participants using a multi-pronged strategy: 1) direct marketing; 2) local media; 3) social media, 4) snowball recruitment and; 5) community organizations. We have used these methods successfully in many of our experience with general recruitment and have consistently met our recruitment goals. Direct marketing has been particularly useful recently. In the CITY trial,57 recently conducted at Duke, 40% of the [ADDRESS_803509] consistently led to participant inquiries. We will also advertise in local newspapers (circulation: > 150,000), television, and radio. We will work with local websites and bloggers to advertise the study. We will also place geographically targeted advertisements via Facebook and Google. Our group is 
  
Protocol renewal approved by [CONTACT_606472]:  7/21/2021  Page 9  also very active on Twitter (with both local and national followers); we will advertise the study and answer questions using the service. We maintain excellent relationships with several community organizations, including those that service high risk populations. This includes faith-based organizations with whom we have worked on previous trials of mHealth weight loss interventions (e.g., Shape Plan) and a large, local historically Black university (North Carolina Central University). We have been particularly successful using endorsements from key community figures (e.g., college sports stars, church pastors, etc.). Of note, two of our most recent mHealth trials were conducted in a community health center system with more than 42,[ADDRESS_803510] in serving as a recruitment site. It is important for our sample to be diverse, particularly considering evidence that racial/ethnic minorities both experience the health effects of obesity at disproportionately high rates, and that use of text messaging in these groups is almost ubiquitous. 18 We will recruit a sample that is 30% male and 40% racial/ethnic minority (similar to the demographics of Durham, N.C.). We have extensive experience in this area.  Screening, randomization and blinding: Those who respond to study marketing will undergo preliminary eligibility screening via a Qualtrics eligibility survey linked from our study website. As with our other trials, we will request a waiver of written consent to screen and consent participants by [CONTACT_169993]. Those deemed potentially eligible will be invited to complete the study informed consent process and baseline surveys via a Qualtrics survey. Participants who complete the informed consent process and all surveys will be invited for an in-person visit. At the visit, study staff will collect written informed consent and confirm participant eligibility. Study surveys will eliminate or define medical terms, and use simple sentence structure and vocabulary. We have successfully used this approach in several studies. This will be followed by [CONTACT_606475].   We will randomize participants at the baseline visit. Randomization sequences will be generated by a computer algorithm using a covariate adaptive randomization method, in which group assignment will be informed by [CONTACT_606476]/ethnicity and gender in the previously assigned participants. This method minimizes imbalance between groups for these characteristics, even in a small sample where the risk of imbalance is high and when the exact composition of the sample is not known a priori. Due to the nature of the interventions, it will be difficult to completely blind staff collecting data to treatment assignment. However, we will ensure that different study staff collect follow-up data and we will take all possible steps to blind those data collection staff to treatment assignment. Outcomes will be analyzed blind to allocation status.  Retention: Our team has an excellent record of retaining our trial participants. In Shape, we retained 96% of participants (in a profoundly socioeconomically disadvantaged population) at the 18-month follow-up. In our current study, Track, we also have a >90% 6-month retention rate in a medically vulnerable population. We will use strategies that have been successful in prior studies (e.g., contact[CONTACT_606478], incentivizing provision of changed contact [CONTACT_3031], birthday/holiday cards, using family contacts, text messaging and social media). To maximize retention, participants will receive reimbursements at each of the evaluation visits: baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Participants who come to all 3 follow-up visits (after baseline) will receive another $15. Home visits will be used when other contact [CONTACT_606479]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_606465], we have set a conservative floor of 70% retention at [ADDRESS_803511] exceeded this rate in all of our recent trials.  Phase II 
  
Protocol renewal approved by [CONTACT_606472]:  7/21/2021  Page 10   After enrollment is completed for the in-person cohort (Phase I), we will enroll up to 5000 participants in a virtual cohort where there will be no in-person data collection. Participants will be recruited similarly to phase I, with 1) direct marketing; 2) community forums; 3) social media, 4) snowball recruitment and; 5) community organizations. Those who respond to study advertisements will take an eligibility survey via Qualtrics, consent and complete a baseline questionnaire. Eligible participants will be randomized via Prompt and receive the same 6-month iOTA-based intervention.  Since phase II participants will not come in for in-person follow-up assessments, participants will send us pi[INVESTIGATOR_606466] a scale, with the weight visible wearing only light clothing with empty pockets and no shoes at 3-, 6- and 12-months.    3.  Risks and Benefits  This is a minimal risk study, and thus we do not anticipate problems beyond our control that involve risks to subjects.       Physical activity: Risks from increased physical activity will be minimized by: 1) recommending physical activity in line with national guidelines; 2) encouraging moderate activity; and 3) directing participants to their physicians when appropriate. If exercise-related symptoms are reported, we will advise participants to get clearance from their PCPs before they can restart physical activity.  Participants will be counseled to change behaviors that will maintain or reduce weight. If individuals follow this advice and decide to change their health behaviors, there should be few risks or side effects. The materials and counseling will provide guidance on preventing and managing the side effects of health behavior change.  Data confidentiality: We will use the standard operating procedures that have been used on our prior trials for survey conduct and data management. These procedures have been developed and used in many studies and we will adhere to these procedures for the proposed study. All paper files related to the study will be stored in a secure location at Duke University in a locked file cabinet accessible only to key study personnel. The privacy, security, and durability of accumulated personal health information are of paramount importance. Our existing practices physical access to computing resources (hard drives, servers, networking equipment) is secure, audited, and restricted to skilled personnel; virtual access (login and system administration) is encrypted, audited, and limited to skilled personnel; all databases are encrypted and access from the public Internet is precluded; all software and servers are reachable only via a virtual private network (VPN); and alinterface (API) and third-party software is encrypted using SSL. Personnel will have access to perform regular maintenance duties. However, this constituency is limited to senior system administrators and the director of the research group.  Breach of confidentiality: All participant information collected in the context of this study, and even the fact that an individual is participating in the study, will be considered confidential. Confidentiality will be assured through several mechanisms. First, each participant will be assigned an anonymous study ID that will be used on all study forms. Second, all study forms 
  
Protocol renewal approved by [CONTACT_606472]:  7/21/2021  Page 11  and paper records that contain participant information (e.g., address lists) will be kept in secured, locked areas or in encrypted databases. In addition, such materials, when in use, will be kept away from public scrutiny. Materials that need to be discarded will be destroyed. Third, access to all participant data and information will be restricted to authorized personnel. In the case of computerized study data, access to data will be password protected and staff members will be assigned individualized passwords that allow them access to only those elements of the data management system to which they are authorized. In addition, all study personnel will maintain certification with the Duke IRB that they have completed training in research ethics, which includes training on confidentiality. Finally, participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_169351], nor will data be presented in such a way that the identity of individual participants can be inferred.  All information obtained in the course of the study that identifies an individual will be treated as confidential in accordance with section 903C of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.299a-1). We will strip all identifiers from analytic data sets after data merging and will keep all personal identifiers in a separate location from the analytic data. No individual participant will be identified in any reports from the study. Data storage will involve computer files that will be password protected and encrypted and will be accessible only to personnel who need to contact [CONTACT_4317].  Study surveys, including the online eligibility screen, will be administered using Qualtrics. We will deliver separate surveys to participants in order to minimize drop off and maximize participant security. Each participant will be asked to fill out one survey with his or her name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3031]; participants will thereafter use only study ID or a unique link when completing surveys. At various timepoints throughout data collection and after, we will download survey data from Qualtrics for analyses. Data sets will be de-identified before being downloaded. Data will be downloaded using the Qualtrics export feature. Data will be -protected. A copy of the raw de-identified data set and/or the results of the analyses will be uploaded to a Box sensitive folder. When the study biostatistician is ready to analyze the data in SAS, a statistical analysis program. She will upload the de-identified data, and SAS will store a copy locally to work from. This data set will be deleted from SAS after analyses are completed.   In order to send and receive text messages, we will use a software engine designed by [CONTACT_606480], called Prompt. Prompt uses Twilio, Heroku, and Amazon S3. Prompt will receive self-monitoring data that participants send via text message. The data will be automatically analyzed each week according to algorithms we embed. Study staff will log into a password-protected database using multi-factor authentication to view and edit participant information. We will use Twilio to send text messages to participants each week. We delete data from Twilio at least every 2 weeks. We will use Heroku to process data for the engine. We will use Amazon S3 to store data; data will be encrypted when it is stored. If these companies or their business partners disclose data, it may no longer be covered under the Duke privacy protections. Text messaging does not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication. Participants will be made aware of these risks as well as those that are inherent in using text messaging during the informed consent process. We have used these processes on several previous studies conducted in this population.   Potential Benefits: Potential benefits for study participants include improved lifestyle, lower weight and blood pressure and consequent reduction in cardiovascular risk. An additional benefit for some participants may be personal satisfaction in being part of a study that may have major public health implications for the community. No benefit from participation can be

We will use the standard operating procedures that have been used on our prior trials for survey conduct and data management. All paper files related to the study will be stored in a secure location at Duke University in a locked file cabinet accessible only to key study personnel. The privacy, security, and durability of accumulated personal health information are of paramount importance. Physical access to computing resources (hard drives, servers, networking equipment) is secure, audited, and restricted to skilled personnel; virtual access (login and system administration) is encrypted, audited, and limited to skilled personnel; all databases are encrypted and access from the public Internet is precluded; all software and servers are reachable via a password-protected database that is enabled with multifactor authentication; and all communication (API) and third-party software is encrypted using SSL. Personnel must have access to these databases to perform regular maintenance duties. However, this constituency is limited to senior system administrators and the director of the research group.  Strategies for protecting electronic PHI: Screening, outcome measures (height, weight, sociodemographics) and surveys will be entered into Qualtrics and Redcap. We will also enter some participant information (phone number, study group, and behavioral goals) into a software engine developed by [CONTACT_606480]. Prompt is developed on Heroku, a managed container system for data. We will use Heroku to process data analytics. All web-transmitted data are encrypted using a protocol called Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This type of security is most often used for web sites that are doing eCommerce (selling products/services over the Internet). The reason for the increased security is to protect the privacy of visitors/customers and transmission of personal, confidential, financial or billing information over the Internet. We will also password protect study data on Prompt and use multifactor authentication processes. As described above, physical access to computing resources (hard drives, servers, networking equipment) is secure, audited, and restricted to skilled personnel; virtual access (login and system administration) is encrypted, audited, and limited to skilled personnel; all databases are encrypted and access from the public Internet is  (API) and third-party software is encrypted using SSL. Only research staff who have received CITI Certification and are listed on the Duke University Institutional Review Board protocol will have access to the study database. Information in the database will not be shared with anyone outside the research team.

 Page 1 	1 Study	Overview	Background/Introduction:		1.1 Study	Aims	• Determine the effect of each of the five intervention components on absolute weight change from baseline to 6 months. • Assemble a multicomponent treatment package including the comparator level of components with standardized main effect sizes of ≥ 0.7 kg.  Otherwise, include the default level, unless interactions of ≥ 0.7 kg are present that would cause us to include the comparator level. 2 Study	Population	2.1 Inclusion	Criteria	• English language proficiency • BMI above 25 kg/m2 • Own a smartphone • Be willing to receive multiple text messages daily. • We	aimed	to	recruit	a	sample	that	is	30%	male	and	40%	racial/ethnic	minorities.	2.2 Exclusion	Criteria	• Exclusion criteria include the following conditions: prior or planned bariatric surgery; psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396279] 12 months; pregnancy, nursing, or planned pregnancy; history of a cardiovascular event; history of an eating disorder; history of a condition (e.g., end stage renal disease, cancer, schizophrenia) or use of medications (e.g., lithium, steroids, anti-psychotics) that would affect weight measurement, for which weight loss is contraindicated, or might promote weight change; current participation in a weight loss trial and/or recent weight loss > 10%, and; investigator discretion for safety reasons.  2.3 Sample	size	Sample size: We plan to recruite [ADDRESS_803526] English language proficiency, and a BMI between 25-40 kg/m2. We plan to recruit a sample that is 30% male and 40% racial/ethnic minority.   Using the FactorialPowerPlan SAS Macro,[ADDRESS_803527] deviation estimate from a recent weight loss trial3 of 5 kg, and a within-participant correlation of 0.9, this translates into a 0.75 kg difference in weight loss at 6 months between groups given the comparison level of the intervention component and those groups with the default level of the intervention component (main effects). We determined that a total sample size of 282 subjects would be required to achieve an overall power of 80% to detect a 0.75 kg difference in weight loss. We conservatively assume 30% dropout at 6 months, so we inflate the sample size to 403. To obtain an equal number of participants in each treatment combination (condition), we further inflate this sample size to 448, which is a final sample of 14 participants in each of the 32 conditions. The main effects are then estimated with 224 participants receiving either level of each component. Likewise, pairwise interactions are based on comparisons of means for 224 participants who receive both or neither component compared to those who received only one. 2.4 Data	Acquisition

 Page 3 4 Statistical	Analysis	Plan		Notes:	Participants	in	the	full-length	pi[INVESTIGATOR_606470],	since	they	ended	up	being	recruited	right	about	when	the	full	trial	started,	and	were	not	actually	used	to	fix	bugs	in	the	program.		In	the	primary	analysis,	those	whose	data	is	collected	outside	of	the	study	window	will	be	treated	as	missing	for	that	time	point.		Sensitivity	analyses	will	be	performed	including	such	data.		For	each	of	the	five	components,	participants’	weights	and	demographics	will	be	summarized	by	[CONTACT_606486].		Continuous	variables	will	be	summarized	using	means,	standard	deviations,	medians,	quartiles,	and	ranges,	and	categorical	variables	will	be	summarized	using	counts	and	percentages.		The	primary	outcome	is	absolute	change	in	weight	from	baseline	to	6	months.		We	will	estimate	the	main	effects	of	each	intervention	component	on	the	primary	outcome	and	of	all	pairwise	interactions	of	those	components	at	each	follow-up	time	point	using	a	linear	mixed	effects	model.		In	order	to	estimate	effects	on	weight	change,	the	model	will	include	as	outcomes	absolute	weight	at	baseline	and	each	follow-up	time	point.	The	model	will	include	fixed	effects	for:	time	point	(3	months,	and	6	months,	and	12	months),	the	time-by-component	and	time-by-pairwise	up	to	five-way	interactions,	and	gender	(the	variable	by	[CONTACT_606487]).		We	do	not	include	the	effects	of	the	components	at	baseline.		This	constrains	the	baseline	comparisons	to	be	equal,	which	is	appropriate	in	a	randomized	trial	and	increases	power.4,5		The	model	will	allow	us	to	estimate	weight	change	and	percentage	weight	change	at	the	interim	time	point	(month	3)	and	final	follow-up	time	point	(month	12),	but	the	main	estimate	of	interest	will	be	the	five	treatment	indicators	by	[CONTACT_24473]	[ADDRESS_803531]	on	weight	loss	at	6	months	greater	than	or	equal	to	0.7	kg	(1.5	lbs),	and	no	significant	interaction	with	another	component,	then	the	superior	level	of	the	component	will	be	retained	for	the	intervention	package.		Otherwise,	if	there	is	no	significant	main	effect	or	interaction,	the	default	(reference)	level	of	the	component	will	be	retained.		We	will	reconsider	inclusions	based	on	the	presence	of	large	(effect	≥	0.7	kg)	interactions.		This	decision	making	is	based	on	the	approach	outlined	in	Collins	et	al.[ADDRESS_803532]	coding,	rather	than	dummy	coding,	for	analyzing	the	effects	of	the	intervention	components.7		If	the	sample	size	is	equal	per	condition,	all	of	the	tests	of	main	effects	and	interactions	are	uncorrelated—that	is,	the	main	effect	of	a	condition	is	the	same	even	if	other	treatment	conditions	and	interactions	are	included	in	the	statistical	model.		Even	with	unequal	sample	sizes	across	conditions	(as	may	occur	with	differential	dropout	by	[CONTACT_3004]),	if	the	imbalance	is	minor,	the	correlations	between	effects	should	be	small.[ADDRESS_803533]	30%.	Since	the	mixed	model	will	be	fit	using	a	full	maximum	likelihood	method,	we	will	be	able	to	account	for	predictors	of	missingness	in	the	model	in	order	to	obtain	valid	estimates	of	the	main	component	effects,	thanks	to	the	property	that	the	response	can	be	missing	at	random	(MAR)	as	defined	by	[CONTACT_606488].[ADDRESS_803534]	for	these	variables	in	the	model	in	order	to	obtain	valid	estimates.		In	addition,	we	will	examine	gender	as	a	potential	moderator,	where	those	who	answered	“non-binary”	will	be	excluded	from	the	analysis,	given	the	extremely	small	numbers	of	participants	who	
 Page [ADDRESS_803535]	moderators,	but	these	results	may	be	used	to	guide	future	studies.		Engagement	data	will	be	summarized	and	displayed	in	a	table.

 Page 8 7 Appendix	A		Motivational messaging (self- vs expert-generated)  Self: As part of Charge, we’d like you to write some motivational messages to yourself. These messages will help you stay positive and encouraged. Your next step to get started is to write yourself a few messages to get you started. We will text these to you a few times a week.   Expert-generated: As part of Charge, we’ll be sending you motivational text messages a few times a week. These messages were written by [CONTACT_606489][INVESTIGATOR_606471], and are meant to help you stay positive and encouraged.   Texting frequency (daily vs weekly)  Daily: Every day, we will text you to ask how you did yesterday with each of your 4 Charge goals. The text will look like this: “Yesterday, did you: eat any red zone foods, drink any sugary drinks, eat 5+ fruits and vegetables, eat any sweet snacks?” You will reply to this message with your answers to each yes/no question - like this: “y, y, y, n” After we get your reply, we’ll send you personalized feedback and some tips/ideas about how to reach your goals. Taking a few seconds to reply to us every day helps us keep track of your progress over time – by [CONTACT_606490], we can give you the most personalized and helpful feedback.  Weekly: Every week, we will text you to ask how you did with each of your 4 Charge goals. The text will look like this: “Last week, how many days did you: eat any red zone foods, drink any sugary drinks, eat 5+ fruits and vegetables, eat any sweet snacks?” You will reply to this message with your answers to each yes/no question - like this: “2, 3, 2, 1” After we get your reply, we’ll send you personalized feedback and some tips/ideas about how to reach your goals. Taking a few seconds to reply to us every week helps us keep track of your progress over time - by [CONTACT_606490], we can give you the most personalized and helpful feedback.  Reminders (one vs multiple)  One: If you don’t reply to the first text we send you each [day/week], we will text you one more time to remind you to track your progress. We recommend replying to the first text we send you, so you get it out of the way!   Multiple: If you don’t reply to the first text we send you each [day/week], we will text you a few more times over the [day/week] to remind you to track your progress. We recommend replying to the first text we send you, so you get it out of the way!  Feedback type (summary score vs individual goal)  Summary score: When we send you feedback every [day/week] we will send one number, an overall score, that considers how you’re doing on all of your goals.  Individual goal: When we send you feedback every [day/week], we will give you feedback on specific goals. You may not get feedback on how you’re doing on every one of your goals individually, but we’ll send you smart feedback based on how you’re doing over time.    Comparison unit (self vs group)  
 Page 9 Self: The feedback we send you each [day/week] will take into account how you’ve been doing. The more [days/weeks] you track your goals, the better our feedback will be. For example, we may say “You’ve been getting better at meeting all your goals!” or “Looks like your progress is slowing on each of your goals”.   Group: The feedback we send you each [day/week] will take into account how you’ve been doing compared to other people in Charge. For example, we may say, “Only a quarter of Charge participants are doing better than you are” or “Your scores have placed you in the top 10% of program participants”.

Similar to Charge, participants (n= 175 in the intervention arm) were asked to change 4 weight-related behaviors at a time and to report their progress via text message (or automated phone calls) every week. In Track, each participant was assigned [ADDRESS_803536] Cycle (weeks 1-8) and some people tracked it in a different cycle, later in the study. We have self-
 Page [ADDRESS_803537] 1 obesity-related co-morbidity.   In the summary score + group comparison condition (in both self-monitoring conditions), we’ll calculate an average score across all 4 goals a participant is tracking each day or week.   We will create a score from the *same 4 goals* as the participant has using the *mean score of each goal* for all participants who tracked it the same cycle week as the participant. This would mean we could include everyone who ever tracked “No Sugary Drinks” - whether they track it in Cycle 1, 3, or 5. We’d match the score to their cycle week - so if a Charge participant is in the 4th week of Cycle 2, they’d be compared to Track participants who ever tracked “No Sugary Drinks” in the 4th week of any cycle.  We will calculate the following variables to use as referent data: For the people who get a summary score: a. Average summary score for each week (All participants, all goals) b. % of people who get each summary score for each week c. Mode for each summary score each week d. Median for each summary score for each week  For people who get feedback on specific goals: a) the average score for each goal each week b) The percent of people who got each score for each goal each week c)  the mode for each individual goal each week d) the median for each goal score for each week. This allows us to analyze the data differently to provide feedback variety - we can tell people their percentile (you’re in the top 10%!) or how they’re doing compared to most other people, or how they are doing compared to the group’s average.

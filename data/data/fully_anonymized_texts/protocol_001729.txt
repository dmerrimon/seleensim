Methodology:   
At the Day 1 Visit, subjects will provide written (signed and dated) informed consent prior to any study 
specific procedures being performed.  The investigator will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria prior to enrollment in this rollover study.
Subjects will have completed the post-treatment period of the prior [COMPANY_013] HCV clinical study.  All 
subjects will be followed for approximately [ADDRESS_646093]-treatment Week 12 to assess the SVR
12result, and then they will discontinue from the study.
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:
Main Inclusion:   
1. The subject has received at least one dose of an ABT-493- and/or ABT-530-containing regimen in a 
prior [COMPANY_013] HCV Phase 2 or 3 study which has been conducted under a US IND (see Appendix D for list of eligible prior studies).
2. The interval between the last dose of the [COMPANY_013] DAA therapy from the previous clinical study and 
enrollment in Study M13-[ADDRESS_646094]-treatment period of an eligible prior study.
Main Exclusion:   
1. The investigator considers the subject unsuitable for the study for any reasons (e.g., failure to comply 
with study procedures in the prior [COMPANY_013] clinical study).
2. Receipt of any investigational HCV antiviral treatment after receiving ABT-493 and/or ABT-530 in 
the prior study.
3. Subjects who experienced non-virologic treatment failures due to premature discontinuation of study 
drug in the prior study of ABT-493/ABT-530.
4. Participation in [COMPANY_013]'s Study M15-942 protocol for re-treatment for virologic failures in the prior 
Phase 2 or 3 study.
Investigational Products: There is no [COMPANY_013] Investigational Product administered.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Virologic response will be assessed by [CONTACT_501577] 10IU/mL at various time points.
ABT-493, ABT-[ADDRESS_646095] 2015-000452-24
8
Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Resistance:
The persistence of amino acid variants associated with drug resistance will be assessed by [CONTACT_66067], 
and/or deep sequencing at the Day [ADDRESS_646096]'s last dose of DAA therapy in the prior [COMPANY_013] clinical study.
Liver Disease Progression:
Liver Disease progression will be assessed by [CONTACT_501578] (FibroTest and APRI) and the 
recording of medical events related to progression of liver disease including, events of hepatic decompensation (per Section [IP_ADDRESS]), change in Child-Pugh classification, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, death.
Safety:
Only serious adverse events related to study procedures or those considered by [CONTACT_501579]-530 and/or ABT-493 in a prior study will be assessed.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoints are the percentage of subjects who maintain a sustained virologic 
response and the percentage of subjects who relapse or have new HCV infection at any time up to the last follow-up in this study out of subjects who achieved SVR
12in the previous study and enroll in this study.  
The summary will be separate for subjects who have probable relapse as distinguished from subjects who have probable new HCV infection based on DNA sequence phylogenetic analysis of HCV drug target genes.  In addition, the time to relapse or new infection from the end of DAA treatment for subjects who achieved HCV RNA < LLOQ at the end of treatment in the previous study and from SVR
12time point for 
the subset of subjects who achieved SVR 12in the previous study will be displayed graphically using 
Kaplan-Meier curves.
Resistance:
The variants at each amino acid position by [CONTACT_153681]/or deep sequencing at available post-baseline 
time points compared to baseline and prototypic reference standard sequences will be summarized by [CONTACT_501580].
Safety:
Serious adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
and tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  A summary of medical events related to the progression of liver disease and shifts in laboratory measurements will be provided.

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 170 million 
individuals infected worldwide.1  There are 6 major HCV genotypes, with genotype 1 
(GT1) being most prevalent worldwide, including in the [LOCATION_002].  HCV genotypes 2 (GT2) and 3 (GT3) infections are more common in Latin America (5% to 30%), Europe (20% to 40%) and Asia (30% to 45%).
2,[ADDRESS_646103] that HCV GT3 causes 12% 
of HCV infections in the [LOCATION_002].[ADDRESS_646104] Asia.
5  Depending on various risk factors, between 
10% and 40% of patients with chronic HCV infection will develop cirrhosis.6  Death 
related to the complications of cirrhosis  may occur at an incidence of approximately 4% 
per year; hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in this population at an estimated incidence of 1% to 5% per year.
[ADDRESS_646105] a 33% 
probability of death during the first year.6  Successful treatment of HCV has been shown 
to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and related mortality as well as the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
7,8
Since the identification of HCV in the early 1990's, the mainstay of tr eatment,  until the 
recent development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs), had been interferon alpha (IFN).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_501564], including co-administration with ribavirin (RBV), development of pegylated interferon (pegIFN), suboptimal efficacy in many populations and poor safety and tolerability limit widespread use of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_501565]-infected patients.
Further advances in treatment for HCV GT1 infection have been the addition of DAAs,
such as an HCV nonstructural (NS) 3/4A protease inhibitor (PI) (telaprevir, boceprevir, or simeprevir), the HCV NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir, or the HCV nucleotide NS 5B RNA polymerase inhibitor (sofosbuvir) to pegIFN/RBV (PR).  This latter regimen demonstrated increased sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in PR treatment-naïve (TN) HCV GT1-infected patients from 55% to 90%; however, response rates are lower in 
ABT-493, ABT-[ADDRESS_646106] 2015-000452-24
14
a number of subpopulations including blacks, Hispanics, PR-experienced patients, and 
cirrhotics.9-14  Many of the current approved treatments for HCV GT1 include use of PR, 
which is associated with considerable, often treatment limiting toxicities (fever, chills, rigor, fatigue, depression, and anemia).  The addition of first generation PIs to a PR regimen has resulted in additional toxiciti es (anorectal discomfort) and augmented others 
(anemia, rash).
15,16
As of October 2014, an IFN- and RBV-free co mbination of SOF plus NS5A inhibitor 
ledipasvir has been approved in the US for the treatment of chronic HCV GT1 infection, including an option of 8-week therapy in non-cirrhotic p atients with HCV viral load 
< 6 million at baseline.
17  As of late December 2014, an IFN-free combination of 
ombitasvir (NS5A inhibitor), paritaprevir (protease inhibitor), dasabuvir (non-nucleoside NS5b polymerase inhibitor) and ritonavir, given with or without RBV, has been approved for the treatment of chronic HCV GT1 infection.
[ADDRESS_646107] 2015-000452-24
15
substitutions also persisted after treatment.22,23  Emergence of resistance to DAAs may be 
even more common in the clinical setting where adherence may be lower than what has 
been observed in the clinical trials.
The aim of treatment of chronic HCV infection is to achieve a sustained virologic 
response (SVR).  HCV infection is cured in more than 99% of patients who achieve an undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after treatment completion.
6  The validity of using 
undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after completion of therapy (SVR 12) has been 
accepted by [CONTACT_501581] U.S. and Europe given that the concordance with 
SVR 24approaches 99%.6The long-term durability of SVR has been demonstrated among 
subjects with HCV infection with multiple different genotypes treated with IFN-based regimens (i.e., IFN alone or IFN plus RBV).  For example, among the first 103 patients 
treated at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, 100 patients, or 97%, maintained SVR at 
a median follow-up of 7.5 years.
24
Although achievement of an SVR has been associated with laboratory and histological improvements in chronic HCV,
25the SVR endpoint is a surrogate for the ultimate aim of 
therapy, which is prevention of progression to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and death from liver disease.24  These "hard" clinical endpoints, 
however, generally take years to decades to occur, making them impractical and unethical primary endpoints for clinical trials of HCV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Thus the relationship between SVR to clinical outcomes must be evaluated through long-term follow-up studies.
In contrast to what is known from studies from IFN-based regimens, little data is available 
to date for SVR and long-term clinical outcomes for subjects who have been treated with 
DAA plus IFN and RBV, or IFN and RBV-free all DAA regimens.  Such studies are needed in order to demonstrate the long-term benefits of DAAs, whether given with IFN and/or RBV, or given as all-DAA regimens.
[COMPANY_013] is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 2 "next generation" DAA drugs for use together or in 
combination with a third DAA or Ribavirin.  [COMPANY_013]'s next generation DAAs, including ABT-493, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor and ABT-530, an NS5A inhibitor are denoted 
ABT-493, ABT-[ADDRESS_646108] 2015-000452-24

"next generation" compounds because each demonstrated potent antiviral activity against 
all major HCV GTs in vitro with no or little loss of potency against known common 
single resistance mutants.

[1,10,17,3,6]trioxadiazacyclononadecino[11,12-b]quinoxaline-10-carboxamide, is an NS3/4A PI [INVESTIGATOR_501566], pangenotypic activity and a high barrier to resistance with activity against common variants that emerge following exposure to first generation PIs.  In the HCV subgenomic replicon assay, ABT-[ADDRESS_646109] replicons, indicating overall it has a higher genetic barrier to resistance than ABT-450 in vitro.  Furthermore, in GT1-4 replicons, the over all 
resistance profile of ABT-493, which selects mos tly A156 variants, is different from that 
of ABT-450, which selects predominantly R155 and D/Q168 variants.  ABT-[ADDRESS_646110] common HCV GT1-4 R155 or D/Q168 variants that are resistant to ABT-450.  [COMPANY_013] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_291098]-[ADDRESS_646111] 2015-000452-24
17
Antiviral activity of ABT-493 monotherapy for 3 days was evaluated in treatment-naïve 
HCV genotype 1-infected patients over a range of doses up to 700 mg QD of ABT-493.  
Preliminary data show that the 200 mg dose of ABT-493 provides strong anti-viral activity (e.g., greater than 3 log
10decline of HCV plasma RNA in all available patients) 
and was selected as ABT-493 dose to be further evaluated in this study.
In general ABT-493 has been well-tolerated when administered to over 320 healthy 
volunteers and 49 HCV GT1-infected subjects.
Preliminary data are suggestive of possible dose/responsive transaminase and bilirubin 
elevations.  ABT-[ADDRESS_646112] been associated with few incidences of asymptomatic Grade 2 (n = 1) and Grade 3 (n = 2) ALT elevations in healthy volunteers.  One sub ject experienced a Grade 3 ALT elevation at the 1200 mg 
dose level (Study M13-586) which resulted in treatment discontinuation, and another subject experienced a Grade 3 ALT elevation at the 700 mg dose level in Study M14-066 which resolved after dosing was concluded without intervention.  Based on the integrated pharmacokinetic exposures of ABT-493 and safety data in Phase 1 studies, a shallow trend was observed for ALT elevation when ABT-493 AUC was higher than [ZIP_CODE] ng•h/mL, which is approximately 64× higher than projected mean AUC exposures at ABT-493 200 mg in non-ci rrhotics and 12× higher – for  cirrhotics.
Bilirubin elevations (primarily indirect hyperbilirubinemia) initiated independently and did not mirror the course of ALT elevations.  Ob served few total bilirubin elevations were 
asymptomatic and likely contributed by [CONTACT_3433] e known ABT-[ADDRESS_646113] bilirubin from blood.  Based on integrated pharmacokinetic exposures of ABT-493 and safety data in Phase 1 studies, a shallow trend was observed for bilirubin elevations when ABT-493 AUC was higher than 25,000 ng•h/mL, which is approximately 27× higher than projected mean AUC exposures at ABT-493 200 mg for non-cirrhotics and 5× higher – for cirrhotics.

In summary, ABT-493 is a potent, pangenotypic NS3/4A PI [INVESTIGATOR_501567].  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

ABT-530
ABT-530, Methyl {(2S,3R)-1-[(2S)-2-{6-[(2R,5R)-1-{3,5-difluoro-4-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)pi[INVESTIGATOR_66808]-1-yl]phenyl}-5-(5-fluoro-2-{(2S)-1-[N-(methoxycarbonyl)-O-methyl-L-threonyl] py rrolidin-2-yl}-1H- benzimidazol-6-yl) pyrrolidin-2-yl]-5-fluoro-1H-
benzimidazol-2-yl}pyrrolidin-1-yl]-3-methoxy-1-oxobutan-2-yl}carbamate, is an NS5A inhibitor with pangenotypic activity and a high barrier to resistance.  ABT-[ADDRESS_646115] all common single nucleotide change resistance associated variants in NS5A in all GTs.  ABT-530 is > 100-fold more active than the first generation NS5A inhibitors (ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and ledipasvir) against key resistance-associated variants selected by [CONTACT_501582]5A amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, and 93.  ABT-530 selected very few or no resistant colonies in HCV replicons with NS5A from GTs 1 – [ADDRESS_646116], the 
genetic barrier to resistance for ABT-530 is higher than ombitasvir across all GTs.  [COMPANY_013] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_291098]-530 to be used in combination with other [COMPANY_013] DAAs for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.
Pharmacokinetics of ABT-530 has been evalu ated up to 600 mg QD.  ABT-530 reached a 
T
maxaround 3 to 5 hours, with an elimination half-life of 12 to 17 hours.  ABT-530 
exposures increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner across the 1.5 mg to 
120 mg dose range and approximately dose proportionally from the 120 mg to 600 mg 
single doses.  The mean percentages of the ABT-530 dose excreted as unchanged drug in urine were less than 0.004%, indicating minimum renal elimination for ABT-530.
In Phase 2a Study M13-595, preliminary results showed same dose ABT-[ADDRESS_646117] 2015-000452-24
19
Antiviral potency of ABT-530 monotherapy f or 3 days in HCV GT1-infected patients was 
evaluated over a range of doses up to 400 mg QD of ABT-530.  Preliminary data show 
that the 40 mg and 120 mg doses of ABT-530 provide similar strong anti-viral potency (e.g., greater than 3 log
10decline of HCV plasma RNA in all available patients) and were 
selected as ABT-[ADDRESS_646118] AEs reported were Grade 1 in severity, demonstrated no pattern or resulted in study drug discontinuation.  Additionally, no pattern of laboratory  abnormalities ha s been observed.
In summary, ABT-530 has the potential to address an unmet need in the treatment of chronic HCV infection.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

Additive or synergistic in vitro anti-HCV activity has been demonstrated with the combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530.
When ABT-493 was given in combination with ABT-530 in healthy volunteers, 
preliminary results showed ABT-493 exposures were not significantly changed when co-administered with ABT-530 ( ≤ 31% difference); however, the exposure of ABT-530 
increased in an ABT-493-dose-dependent manner (from 1.5-fold at 100 mg ABT-493 up to 3- to 4-fold at 400 mg ABT-493).
Drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies ha ve also been conducted to evaluate the 
co-administration effects of ABT-493 and ABT-530 on substrates of P-gp, BCRP, 
OATP1B1/1B3, OAT3 and CYP3A4.  Studies are summarized in the investigator brochures.

ABT-[ADDRESS_646148] participated in Phase 2 or 3 clinical studies with these agents for the treatment of chronic HCV.  No [COMPANY_013] study drug will be administered in this study.  As such, the absence of randomization, blinding or control groups is appropriate.  No quantitative analyses or tests of statistical significance are planned; statist ical analyses w ill be purely descriptive.

virologically prior to starting [COMPANY_013] DAA treatment and the duration and magnitude of their exposure to [COMPANY_013] DAA treatment will be well documented.
6.0 Adverse Events
As this is a non-drug interventional study, only serious adverse events that the investigator considers reasonably related to interventio nal study procedures (i.e., venipunctures) or 
those considered reasonably related to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 exposure in the prior study ( Appendix D ) by [CONTACT_501589].  Events that are considered 
related to underlying disease, events that are accidental (i.e., road traffic accidents), and elective procedures (i.e., hip replacement) would not be routinely considered related to ABT-530 and/or ABT-[ADDRESS_646151] any such serious adverse event in detail including 
the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), and any action(s) taken.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Serious adverse events related to study procedures or reasonably related to exposure to ABT-493 and/or ABT-[ADDRESS_646152] will be collected.
These serious adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1 Definitions
6.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) in this study is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject that occurs as a result of a study procedure, or is considered by [CONTACT_501590]-493 and/or ABT-[ADDRESS_646153] 2015-000452-24
34
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria and is causally related to study 
procedures (i.e., venipunctures) or those consider ed by [CONTACT_501591]-493 and/or ABT-530 in the previous study, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_646154]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
ABT-493, ABT-[ADDRESS_646155] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions th at do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE 
Version 4).
The table of clinical toxicity grades "Nati onal Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation 
Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI CTC AE for a given diagnostic/symptomatic AE term to identify and apply specific grading details for that AE entity.

Grade 5 Death related to AE
ADL = Activities of Daily Living
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.
6.3 Relationship to Study Procedures or Study Drug Exposure 
in the Prior Study
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to a study procedure or to exposure to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 in the previous study:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study procedure or ABT-530 and/or 
ABT-[ADDRESS_646157] a causal 
relationship between the study procedure or ABT-530 and/or 
ABT-493 exposure in the previous study and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to a study procedure, or to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 exposure in the previous study will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to a study proce dure or ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 exposure in 
the previous study will be considered "not associated."
ABT-493, ABT-[ADDRESS_646158] 2015-000452-24
37
6.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events that occur during the current study period, and are considered 
related to a study procedure (like an SAE r elated to venipuncture), or reasonably related to 
exposure to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 that was administered during the previous study period (note:  no study drugs are administered during the current study period) will be collected from the time of the Day [ADDRESS_646159] study procedure or discontinuation from study, whichever is later.
Serious adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1. Serious Adverse Event Collection
* Serious adverse events considered related to study procedures (like an SAE due to venipuncture), or considered 
related to drugs that were administered during the prior study period (no study drugs administered during the 
current study period).
6.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event (as described in Section 6.4), the Investigator will 
notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the 
serious adverse event by [CONTACT_26280] (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE

(1) those with on-treatment virologic failure (VF) in the previous study; (2) those with 
post-treatment relapse prior to enrollment in Study M13-576; and (3) those who become 
viremic (with HCV) during Study M13-576.
A listing by [CONTACT_501592] M13-576 who 
experienced VF (as defined above) that includes HCV subtype, IL28B genotype, time point of VF, HCV RNA level at each evaluated time point, time point(s) sequenced, and assessment of possibility of new infection.  The study report will include a description of 
the methods and results used to distinguish between virologic relapse and new infection in subjects suspected to have a new infection.
Only samples with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL will undergo sequence analysis 
in order to allow accurate assessment of the products of amplification.  For subjects who 
experience VF before or during Study M13-576, the sample closest in time after the failure with an HCV RNA level ≥ 1000 IU/mL will be used if the HCV RNA level at the 
time of VF is < 1000 IU/mL.
The regions of interest for population and/or deep sequencing from all evaluated time 
points in this study are those encoding complete NS3/4A, and/or NS5A (based on regimen received in the earlier study).  Subtype-specific prototypic reference strains for sequence analyses will be utilized.

For each DAA target, signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions will be 
identified by [CONTACT_41622].
The following definitions will be used in the resistance analyses:
●Baseline sample:  sample collected before the first dose of DAA study drug in 
the previous study.
●Baseline variant:  a variant (by [CONTACT_501593]) in the baseline sample determined by [CONTACT_501594] a given DAA target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
●Post-baseline variant by [CONTACT_501593]:  an amino acid variant 
in a post-baseline time point sample that was not detected at baseline and is 
detectable by [CONTACT_501595] a given DAA target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
For all subjects who experience VF (whether before or during enrollment in 
Study M13-576), a listing by [CONTACT_501596]-associated amino acid positions will be provided for each DAA target (NS3 and/or NS5A as appropriate).
For all subjects who experience VF (whether before or during enrollment in 
Study M13-576), the HCV amino acid sequence as determined by [CONTACT_501597]-baseline time points (including previous study and Study M13-576) with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL will be compared to the 
baseline and appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequences.  A listing by [CONTACT_41626]-baseline variants detected by [CONTACT_501598] (NS3/4A and/or NS5A as appropriate).  A listing by [CONTACT_41626]-baseline variants (by [CONTACT_501593]) at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions relative to the appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequences will be provided.
ABT-493, ABT-[ADDRESS_646171]-Treatment 
Week 144 (3 years) compared to baseline will be summarized, along with the number of subjects for whom sequence information was obtained for each DAA target and overall.  Additionally, the number and percentage of subjects in whom a signature [CONTACT_501606]-Treatment Week 24, [ADDRESS_646172]-Treatment Week 144 (3 years), out of the total number of subjects with that variant at the VF time point and at Post-Treatment Week 24, [ADDRESS_646173]-treatment Week 144 (3 years) will be summarized by [CONTACT_501599] (NS3 and/or NS5A, as appropriate), and variant.  If a signature [CONTACT_501607] a sample by [CONTACT_501600] a later time 
point, then the variant is imputed as being detectable at earlier time windows even if the sample from the earlier time window from that subject is not sequenced.
If no resistance-associated variants are detected by [CONTACT_501595] a 
given target for a subject either at the time of failure or in a post-treatment sample, then that target may not be sequenced in subsequent samples from that subject.
Time to loss of key resistance-associated variants will be summarized.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening:  Liver Ultrasound
HCC screening will be required as a protocol-specified study procedure  only at the Final 
visit, as indicated in Appendix C , for subjects with cirrhosis only.  At any other time 
during the study, HCC screening should be performed according to standard of care.
At the Final visit, subjects with cirrhosis will be required to perform a liver ultrasound to 
screen for HCC, unless the subject has a liver ultrasound, CT or MRI performed for HCC screening within [ADDRESS_646208] scan or MRI.  Alternate methods of screening for HCC (i.e., MRI or CT) at a study visit should be discussed with the TA MD.

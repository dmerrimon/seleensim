2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROU ND 
 
Wire localization (WL) has been the standard localization technique for guiding 
surgical excision of non -palpable breast lesions for over 20 years (1-3 ). It is effective in 
localizing the intended target with failure rates between 1 -6.7% (4- 6) but it carries risks 
inherent in the technique of placing a wire into a patient’s breast. For one, a portion of 
the wire must reside outside of the breast so the surgeon can use the trajectory of the 
wire to guide the surgical resection . In this case, the wire can be inadvertently dislodged 
at any point following the wire placement and before  the ultimate wire removal in the 
operating room (7) . Also, given its external component, the WL procedure must be 
                LOCALIZER003  STUDY PROTOCOL  
 
Page [ADDRESS_29388] cancers, the rate s of positive 
margins varies widely with this approach ranging from 12 -60% (8-10). Given this and the 
technical difficulties associated with WL, alternatives have been sought  that may 
improve outcome  for patients with breast c ancer treated with  breast conservation 
surgery.  
 
Radioactive  seed localization (RSL) has emerged as an alternate and possibly more 
favorable option for localization and has been a widely studied  alternative . Unlike the 
wire, the radioactive seed is implanted entirely within the breast and this can be performed at any time within [ADDRESS_29389] demonstrated the 
effectiveness of RSL in appropriately targeting the lesion for removal ( 10,11). In 
addition, RSL appea rs to equal if not improve the negative margin rate and re- excision 
rate for lumpectomies for breast cancer compared to WL ( 12-14) . Nonetheless, RSL has 
not been easy to adopt given the regulations necessary to manage and track the radioactive seeds , the s pecial licensing necessary for handling radioactive material,  and 
the coordination necessary between the different departments .  
Other alternatives for lesion localization are  under active investigation. A magnetic 
seed called the Magseed is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial at MD Anderson (Clinicaltrials.gov) . Preliminary concerns include difficulty with the large size of the 
probe compared to incision size for seed detection and the interference from the metal 
surgical instruments which are used during surgery. In addition, presence of the magnetic seed is a contraindication for the higher power 3T MRI’s used to evaluate 
breast lesions and may impose significant artifact if used with the 1.5T MRI’s.  For these 
reasons, we are seeking an alternative for lesion localization.

 Our proposed study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30042]  a recently FDA-approved 
radiofrequency tag for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)  of non -palpable breast 
lesions for surgery. RFID technology is already widely used outside of medicine, most 
commonly in the microchip  for pet identification . The radiofrequency tag (or microchip) 
is passive and  has no internal energy source unlike the radioactive seed. The LOCalizer 
probe used to read the tag  in the operating room emits a  signal that then completes a 
circuit with the tag that allows for localization and detection. Similar to the radioactive 
seed and unlike the wire, the RFID tag is inserted completely within the breast allowing 
uncoupling of the localization procedure from the day of  surgery . But, unlike the 
radioactive seed, there is no concern for signal decay so the RFID tag can be inserted up 
to [ADDRESS_29390] been evaluated for their use in  guiding  positioning of endotracheal tubes for intubation (15 ) 
and locating surgic al sponges in body cavities (16 ). Proof of concept studies have also 
been performed demonstrating the feasibility of using RFID tech nology for localizing 
tumors (17 ). 
 A prospective clinical study evaluating the safety of RFID technology  for localization 
of non-palpable lesions in the breast  was performed  at Harbor UCLA (18 ). In this safety 
analysis study, [ADDRESS_29391] to the patient. The patients

breast surgeons will be participating and enrolling through 2 UCLA sites.

5.[ADDRESS_29393] RECRUITMENT  
 
Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_30052]. The study will be discussed with them at the time of surgical 
planning in a private room. When potential patients are identified, the treating 
surgeon will explain the study purpose, obtain informed consent, and provide 
the patient with a signed copy.  The patient’s surgery and localization procedure 
will then be scheduled .

 6. STUDY PROCEDURE  
 
a) Questionnaires : Each subject will complete a  patient  questionnaire 
(attachment 12.1) following placement of the radiofrequency tag. The 
questionnaires will be completed in a private room immediately following the procedure and no later than [ADDRESS_29394] will also complete a questionnaire (attachment 12. 2) following 
placement of the marker, and the surgeon will complete a questionnaire (attachment 12.3) followi ng the breast surgery.  
         7.   DATA MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION  
 7.1 Sample Size Determination 
 
Sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_30043] 50 patients. Since this is not a 
comparative study, the sample size is based on the width of the confidence interval, not power. Our primary outcomes are successful placement and successful retrieval of the RFID tag. We anticipate 100% success for both 
outcomes. Assuming this is true, a sample size of n=50 allows establishment of 
the lower 95% confidence bound a t 94.2%.  
 The sample size is also b ased on pragmatics of recruitment and patient flow and 
budgetary constraints. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30044] a larger study, implementation of a new FDA-cleared device, and modification of the logistics of the study protocol.   
  
7.2 Statistical Methods

of Study  
 
< [ADDRESS_29396] confidence bounds will be reported for all proportions . For the three Likert questionnaires, a total score will be computed 
for each and summa ry statistics (mean, median, range, proportion who are 
1,2,3,4,5) will be reported for the total score and for each item as well as confidence bounds for the median or mean.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_29397] common localizing device is a hooked wire. We are studying a radiofrequency  marker  as an alternative . 
The pa tient and/or h er insurance will  be billed for the standard of care 
procedure of insertion of the localizing device, the localization mammogram, the specimen mammogram and the surgery  but there will be no cost to the 
patient or her insurance for the RFID tag  itself .  
 Some r isks associated with the localization procedure (regardless of the device 
placed) include pain, bruising, bleeding, swelling , infecti on, lightheadedn ess and 
dizziness . Less common risks include implant rupture, pneumothorax 
(punctured/collapsed lung) or movement (migration) of the marker after placement and before surgery.  The placement of marker may not be successful 
due to inadequate visualization of the abnormality or difficult location of the 
abnormality (too close to the skin surface or too deep in the breast) which precludes safe and accurate placement of the marker. In this case, if placement 
of the standard wire is also considered technically impossible then the breast imager and surgeon will discuss alternatives for lesion localization, such a s 
intraoperative ultrasound localization, placement of skin marker, etc. such as is standard protocol when wire placement is unsuccessful.  
 Failure in this study is defined as inability to localize the lesion with the RFID tag but successful localization with the wire. If both approaches are unsuccessful 
then this would reflect an ability to localize the lesion in general, which is a risk 
of image-guided localizations but not a failure of the tag itself. In the case of defined failure, the patient will req uire a second procedure for wire placement 
prior to surgery.  Failure would also be defined as inability to retrieve the tag 
and/or the lesion. In this case, the patient would require a second localization 
procedure and surgery.  
 
The risks from participation in this study are minimal. Participation is voluntary 
and participants can withdraw any  time after consent but prior to placement of 
the research device without fear of any change in medical treatment.

appropriate lesion localization, surgeons are able to successfully retrieve the 
device, and pati ents do not experience significant adverse side ef fects from 
placement of the tag . 
 The assessment of safety will be based primarily on the frequency of AE’s. The 
research device will most likely be placed within 7 days of surgery but can be 
placed on the morning of surgery out to 30 days prior to surgery . The patient 
will be contact[CONTACT_30053] (unless within 24 hours of surgery) to inquire about adverse events and an AE report form will be completed (attachment 12.4). A follow -up visit within 2 
weeks of surg ery will also occur and will be the final study visit.  
 This study will involve two sites, and study personnel will be notified immediately regarding any documented AE’s or concerns that impact patient safety or continuation of the study.  
 Given the low risk of this study, there is no anticipated toxicity.

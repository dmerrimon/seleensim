ReveraGen  BioPharma, Inc. –  CONFIDENTIAL  Subjects , after they have been on their initial dose for at least [ADDRESS_609778] emerged i n the VBP15 -003 Phase IIa extension study . 
The planned dose levels in the VBP15 -003 study are 0.25 mg /kg (Dose 
Level  1), 0.75 mg/kg (Dose Level 2), 2.0 mg/kg (Dose Level 3), and 6.0 mg/kg 
(Dose Level  4). 
If dose limiting toxicities are identified in the VBP15 -[ADDRESS_609779]’s 
dose level may be decreased to the next lower dose level and maintained at that 
lower dose level throughout the duration of the Treatment Period , with the 
caveat stated below for subjects de- escalating from 6.0 mg/kg/day to 2.0 
mg/kg/day .  In the event the next lower dose level is also not tolerated and is 
considered a safety risk to the subject, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], Study 
Chair, and Medical Monitor, the subject will be withdrawn from the study.   
Subjects whose do se is decreased from 6.0 mg/kg/day to 2.0 mg/kg/day may 
have their dose subsequently increased to 4.0 mg/kg/day if they have been 
taking the 2.0  mg/kg/day dose for at least one month and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], balancing efficacy with safety c oncerns, they could benefit from 
an intermediate higher dose.   
Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability, clinical efficacy, 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and quality of life at scheduled visits throughout 
the 24 -month Treatment Period.  Treatment Period study visits for VBP15 -LTE 
will occur at Month 1, Month 3 and then at 3 -month intervals extending through 
Month 24.  Adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), and 
concomitant medications will be recorded throughout the study.  
Once-daily Treatment Period study drug dosing will occur at home on all days 
throughout the [ADDRESS_609780] of care treatment (e.g., gluco
corticoids) for DMD, as deemed 
appropriate for each subject.  Altern atively, subjects may choose to discontinue 
vamorolone and not begin standard of care glucocorticoid treatment for DMD.  
Subjects who switch to standard of care gluco corticoids for DMD or who 
discontinue treatment will participate in a Dose -tapering Period  of up to 5 
weeks in duration, following the end of the Treatment Period and prior to 
discharge from the study; subjects who elect to receive further vamorolone 
treatment will be discharged from the VBP -LTE study after completion of final 
VBP -LTE study ass essments at the Month 24 Visit, prior to enrollment in the 
separate extension study.   Subjects will be discharged from the study following 
completion of all final Month  24 or Dose -tapering Period assessments, as 
appropriate.

assessment.  Subjects who receive at least one dose of vamorolone but never 
have post -baseline assessments will be excluded.  
Control Population from CINRG Duchenne Natural History Study  
The control population from the CINRG Duchenne Natural History Study will include all subjects who were observed as part of the study in ages ≥  4 years 
and <7 years of age at a start of an interval of observation; observed for at least 
two years with TTSTAND, TTCLIMB, TTRW, NSAA, 6MWT an d QMT 
measured; remained glucocorticoid -naive during the entire observation period; 
and were able to walk independently without assistive devices, able to complete the TTSTAND; and lacked any history of disease, impairment, or medications 
that would have m ade them ineligible to receive the vamorolone intervention as 
defined by [CONTACT_475656]15 -LTE exclusion criteria at the start of the interval.  
Control Population FOR DMD Study  
The control population from the FOR DMD Study will include all subjects who 
were 4-7 years old at entry and who were randomized to the daily prednisone or 
daily deflazacort arm.  
General Statistical Considerations:  
All measurements will be analyzed based upon the type of distribution and descriptive statistics presented by [CONTACT_475657], as 
appropriate.  No interim statistical analyses are planned.  Missing values for safety and exploratory outcomes will be treated as missing.  
All statistical tests will be performed at the 0.05 level.  Paired t- tests will be 
utilized for selec t variables.  When available, baseline from the VBP15 -002 will 
be utilized when calculating change from baseline.  
 Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy outcome is TTSTAND  (velocity) .  Secondary efficacy 
outcomes are the NSAA assessment, TTCLIMB, TTRW, QMT, and the 
6MWT .  TTSTAND, TTCLIMB, and TTRW will be analyzed using raw scores 
and velocity.   
The primary outcome is TTSTAND (velocity) change from VBP15 -002 study 
baseline to Month 24 and will be compared between vamorolone and historical 
untreated con trols using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM).  This model will include fixed effects for treatment, visit, baseline TTSTAND velocity (from the VBP15 -002 study ), 
age at study entry, and the treatment -by-visit interaction.  The initial model will 
compare combine d vamorolone doses to untreated natural history controls and 
subsequent secondary model s may compare individual and other combinations 
of dose levels  to untreated natural history controls.  The secon dary outcome 
measures will be compared using similar models.  Full details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Pharmacodynamics Analyses:  
Serum PD biomarkers of adrenal axis suppression, insulin resistance, and bone 
turnover will be a ssessed, as well as exploratory biomarkers of safety and 
efficacy.  Biomarkers will be summarized descriptively over time.

1.1 Background and Unmet Need  
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_120680].  
Duchenne muscular dystrophy  affects approximately [ADDRESS_609799] partially mediated by

evident during early disease stages and play a significant role in muscle wasting.3  NF-κB 
has been shown to regulate the expression of numerous inflammatory genes in immune 
cells and muscle fibers,4,5,6,7 and the infiltration and activation of these cells can trigger 
muscle fiber death.8,9 
Although significant advances hav e been made in understanding the etiology of DMD, a 
cure has not been found, and current treatment options are all medications used “off -
label” to alleviate the symptoms of DMD.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120681], only

ReveraGen  BioPharma, Inc. –  CONFIDENTIAL  goal of DMD research is to find a mutation- independent treatment that matches or 
exceeds the efficacy of gluco corticoids  with a significantly lower side effect profile.  
Vamorolone is a first -in-class  delta -9, [ADDRESS_609801] 
profiles relative to classic gluco corticoids  in nonclinical models and is anti cipated to be 
an attractive candidate for the treatment of DMD in pediatric patients.  
In vitro , nonclinical , and clinical (Phase I)  data to date suggest that vamorolone may offer 
a much needed alternative to the current glucocorticoids  which are standard o f care for 
DMD,
[ADDRESS_609802] developed

The significant effects of glucocorticoids  on growth and development, however , prevent

ReveraGen  BioPharma, Inc. –  CONFIDENTIAL  addition, vamorolone could be prescribed in later stage non -ambulant young men with 
DMD and for a longer period of time, or in very young infants or neonates with DMD, 
where the risk:benefit balance of glucocorticoids  is often less favorable.  
Efficacy may also be improved over classic glucocorticoids  in the longer term.  In 
addition to the anti -inflammatory properties of vamorolone as a result of NF -κB pathway 
inhibition, vamorolone may also improve efficacy over conventional glucocorticoids  due 
to the lack of interference in the AKT1/F OXO pathway, a key feature of glucocorticoid 
therapy which leads in the long term to muscle wasting and atrophy.[ADDRESS_609804] of membrane 
instability in dystrophin deficient myofibers in DMD.15 
Potentially, the administration of vamorolone to a DMD patie nt may begin soon after 
birth to slow the dystrophic process of muscle, retaining regenerative capacity and substantially improving patient quality of life.  
1.2 Nonclinical Experience 
The safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) and metabolism, and toxicolog y of 
vamorolone have been evaluated in multiple nonclinical studies in vitro  and in mice, rats,

ReveraGen  BioPharma, Inc. –  CONFIDENTIAL  The effect of vamorolone as compared to prednisolone on bone growth and development 
was evaluated in the mdx mouse model of DMD that lacks dystrophin due to a premature 
chain -terminating mutation in the mouse homolo gue of the dystrophin gene.  In the pre -
symptomatic mdx  study, tibia length was measured to determine if vamorolone inhibited 
bone growth.  Prednisolone significantly decreased tibia length whereas vamorolone did 
not affect tibia length at any concentratio n tested.  Micro -computed tomography was 
performed on femurs to examine bone density and structure.  Comparison of vehicle, prednisolone, and the highest vamorolone dose showed prednisolone to significantly 
reduce trabecular thickness compared to vehicle, while vamorolone did not.
15 
In normal, male CD -1® mice, these effects were reproduced.  Unlike CD -[ADDRESS_609806] 
significantly reduced body length, though to a lesser extent as compared to prednisolone.  
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with cardiomyopath y that can become life 
threatening, and increased fibrosis with prednisone treatment in heart muscle of the mdx  
mouse has been reported.24  Histologically, clear fibrosis was evident in 50% of young 
(8-week) pre dnisolone -treated mouse hearts compared to no incidence of fibrosis 
identified in the other groups (wild type; mdx  vehicle, and vamorolone - treated).  
Pharmacologically, gluco corticoids  show immunosuppressive and immunotoxic 
properties that limit therapeutic windows and long- term use.  Vamorolone  (5, 15, 
30 mg/kg/day) was benchmarked against prednisolone (5 mg/kg/day) to determine if 
similar properties were observed.15  Untreated mdx  mice showed increased numbers of 
peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and enlarged spleens resulting from ongoing muscle damage compared to wild type mice.  Vamorolone treatment reduced spleen mass and 
PBL counts in a dose -dependent manner.  This finding is attributed to a reduction in 
muscle damage by [CONTACT_448468].  Prednisolone reduced these measures below wild type, suggesting 
immunosuppressive and/or immunotoxic properties.  Further, prednisolone significantly 
decreased viable splenocytes per gram of tissue (p <0.005), whereas this decrease was not

02).15 
To further query the potential immune modulat ion, the effects of vamorolone and 
prednisolone on counts of splenic B and T -lymphocytes isolated from treated mdx  mice 
were examined.  CD4+ T -cell activation was assayed by [CONTACT_120745] T -cell mitogen, concanavalin A (ConA).  Splenocytes obtained from prednisolone -
treated mice displayed a significant reduction of the percentage of splenic activated 
CD4+CD25+ T -cells upon ConA stimulation while splenocytes derived from 
vamorolone -treated mice did not (ReveraGen Report No. MDX -RBP -VBP1 5-02). 
Taken together, these findings suggest that while prednisolone treatment leads to a 
reduction in T -cell number and activation status, vamorolone modulates inflamed mdx  
immune systems towards a wild type state without compromising T -cell activation s tatus.  
1.2.2 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  
[IP_ADDRESS] Single Dose  
Vamorolone PK profiles were determined in male CD -1 mice, Sprague Dawley rats and 
beagle dogs after a single intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg and after a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg in mice and rats and 30 mg/kg in dogs. 
Pharmacokinetic results for vamorolone following a single intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg in Crl:CD1(ICR) mice demonstrated a clearance (CL) of 18.8 mL/min/kg.  The 
terminal half -life (t

max) of 6787 ng/mL was observed at 2 hours (time to maximum 
observed plasma concentration [T max]) after drug administration, and percent 
bioavailability (F%) was 74.5%.  Following oral administration of 15 mg/kg via cherry

In beagle dogs, vamorolone had a CL of 24.7 mL/min/kg.  The t ½ was 5.42 hours and V ss 
was 1.93 L/kg.  After oral administration of 30 mg/kg in dogs, a C max of 814 ng/mL was 
observed at 6 hours after dose administration and bioavailability was 53.2% (ReveraGen 
Report No. [ZIP_CODE]- 10-464). 
Vamorolone clearance was therefore comparable in all 3 species studied (19-25 mL/min/kg).  Bioavailability ranged from approximately 50% in mouse (cherry 
syrup), rat, and dog to 75% in the mouse (30% Labrafil) (ReveraGen Report Nos. PH-DPMK- VBP -10-004, PH -DPMK- VBP -10-007, [ZIP_CODE]- 10-464).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Multiple Dose  
Crl:CD1 (ICR) mice were administered vamorolone or vehicle once daily for 
28 consecutive days.  Vamorolone exposure (as assessed by [CONTACT_941] C
max and area under the 
concentration -time curve [AUC]) increased with increasing dose on Study Days [ADDRESS_609807] values in the 30 and 100 mg/kg dose groups compared to 
Day 1, indicating possible enzyme induction.  On Study Day 28, mean AUC last values 
were 1.81 -fold and 5.02- fold lower compared to Study Day 1 for the 30 and 100 mg/kg 
dose groups, respectively.  The observed difference in exposure relative to Day 1 increased with the increase in administered dose of vamorolone (ReveraGen Report No. 
1998- 009).  
Beagle dogs were either administered vamorolone or vehicle once daily for 28 consecutive days.  Vamorolone exposure in dogs (as assessed by C
max and AUC last) 
generally increased with increasing dose on Study Days 1 and 28.  For the 2 and 10 mg/kg dose groups, exposure on Da y [ADDRESS_609808] values were 2.35 -fold and 2.43- fold (males) and 3.03- fold and 3.23 -fold

respectively.  For the 50 mg/kg dose group, exposure on Day 28 was similar to that on 
Day 1.  At the 50 mg/kg dose, AUC last values in males were 1.71 -fold lower whereas 
females were 1.22 higher on Day  28 compared to Day 1 (ReveraGen Report No. 
031302). 
Beagle dogs were administered vehicle or vamorolone at doses of 2 mg/kg/day, 
10 mg/kg/day, or 50 mg/kg/day for 39 weeks.  Systemic exposure (AUC 0-24hr) to 
vamorolone appeared to be independent of sex.  Mean AUC 0-24hr and C max values for 
vamorolone increased with increasing dose in an approximately dose proportional 
manner on Days 1 and 270.  Mean systemic exposure (AUC 0-24hr) to vamorolone 
appeared to increase following repeated administration of vamorolone.  Due to the 
alterations in the feeding regimen, changes in systemic exposure following repeated 
administration should be viewed with caution due the influence of feeding on exposure.  
For the 2 and 10 mg/kg/day dose groups, exposure on Day  270 was generally higher  than 
on Day 1, indicating possible inhibition of metabolism of vamorolone at these dose levels.  On Day 270, mean AUC
0-24hr values were 2.34- fold and 2.98- fold higher 
compared to Study Day 1 for the 2 and 10 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively.  For the 
50 mg/kg dose group, exposure on Day 270 was 2.07- fold higher compared to that on 
Day 1 (ReveraGen Report No. 1998- 014).  
Non-naïve cynomolgus monkeys were administered vamorolone (300 and 
600 mg/kg/day) or vehicle once daily for 7 consecutive days.  Vamorol one exposure (as 
assessed by C max and AUC last) generally increased with increasing dose on Study Days  1 
and 7 with the exception of male monkeys on Day 7, which showed no clear increase in exposure between the 300 and 600 mg/kg/day dose levels.  Repeated dosing over the 
7-day study duration was associated with decreases in mean plasma vamorolone AUC
last 
values for female and male monkeys indicating possible metabolic induction.  On Day 7, mean AUC
last values were 1.60- fold, 2.19- fold, and 2.02- fold lower in females and 
1.20- fold, 2.09- fold, and 2.88- fold lower in males compared to Study Day 1 for the 100, 
300 and 600 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively (ReveraGen Report Nos. 1998- 001,

In the plasma protein binding studies, percent bound was similar in human and mouse 
cells in culture (88.06% and 86.71%, respectively).  In the blood partition experiment 
done ex vivo , the blood to plasma ratio was similar between human and mouse (0.87 and 
0.68, respectively), but the red blood cell to plasma ratio for the mouse (0.33) was less than half that of the human (0.74).  Human in vivo data are presented in Section 1.3 
(VBP15 -001).  In the blood/brain concentration mouse experiment in vivo , the plasma 
concentrations of vamorolone were higher than brain concentrations with the AUC and 
C
max approximately 2 -fold higher in plasma than in brain (ReveraGen Report Nos. 
ADME -NCG- PPB-NC135, ADME -VBP -PPB-V002, ADME -NCG- BP-NC134, NCATS 
2013- 38). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Metabolism  
The in vitro  and in vivo  data demonstrate that vamorolone can be metabolized via 
multiple metabolic pathways, including glucuronidation, hydroxylation, and reduction.  Glucuronidation appeared to be the major metabolic pathway in human cells in vitro .  All 
metabo lites observed in human in vitro  were observed in monkey in vitro .  Most human 
metabolites identified in vitro  were also found in mouse and dog.  Thus, there is no 
unique human metabolite identified for vamorolone. 
The metabolic stability of vamorolone was  assessed in non- Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) studies.  Based on the data generated, vamorolone was highly stable for up to 
60 minutes in human, monkey, dog, and mouse liver microsomes in the presence or 
absence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and stable for up to 
60 minutes in rat liver in the absence of NADPH.  Moderate metabolism was apparent in 
rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH stimulation (35% remaining), suggesting that rat was a high metabolizer of vamorolone rela tive to other species (mouse, dog, 
human) (ReveraGen Report Nos. NIH -R2526, and ADME -VBP -LM-V003). 
Vamorolone did not significantly inhibit any of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 
isoforms tested (CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4).  Vamorolone 
moderately induced CYP3A4 (24% to 42%), indicating that vamorolone is a potential

[IP_ADDRESS] Excretion  
Vamorolone showed high plasma clearance in rats but, consistent with the extensive 
metabolism in hepatocytes from this species, the biliary and urinary excretion of the 
parent compound was low with an average of <0.05% of the dose recovered in bile and 
approximately 0.1% in urine.  Overall, vamorolone s howed high plasma clearance and 
extremely low biliary and urinary excretion (ReveraGen Report No. NCATS 2013- 44). 
1.2.3 Toxicology  
[IP_ADDRESS] Single Dose  
Crl:CD1(ICR) mice were administered vamorolone once via oral gavage at 50, 125, 250, 
and 500 mg/kg and observed for abnormalities.  All animals survived to their scheduled 
termination, and there were no significant abnormalities observed.  There was a slight 
decrease in body weight attributed to vamorolone in both males and females at doses 
above 125 mg/kg.  A dose depende nt decrease in food consumption related to 
vamorolone was also observed in males and females.  No other abnormalities were 
observed in experimental mice (ReveraGen Report No. 1998- 002).  
Beagle dogs received single 60, 180, 360, and 750 mg/kg doses of vamor olone using an 
escalation study design with a 4 -day washout period between doses.  All animals 
survived dose escalation.  Clinical signs attributed to vamorolone (750 mg/kg) included 
red discoloration of the ears and face.  This effect occurred within a fe w hours of dosing 
and was transient.  The highest dose also resulted in increased white blood cell count 
(increased neutrophils and monocytes [female only] and decreased lymphocytes and 
eosinophils [male and female]).  At the 360 and 750 mg/kg dose levels, slight elevations 
in albumin were observed.  A mild elevation in cholesterol at the 750 mg/kg (and 
possibly 360 mg/kg) dose level was also observed (ReveraGen Report No. [ZIP_CODE].01.01). 
In cynomolgus monkeys, single oral doses of up to 500 mg/kg were well t olerated with 
no significant abnormalities observed (ReveraGen Report No. 1998- 001).

ReveraGen  BioPharma, Inc. –  CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS] Multiple Dose  
Vamorolone or vehicle was administered to Crl:CD1(ICR) mice once daily for 28 
consecutive days at doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day.  All animals survived to their 
scheduled necropsy with the exception of a female mouse (100 mg/kg/day dose group) 
that was found dead on Day 16.  The cause of death was considered incidental and 
attributed to a dosing injury based on the amount of red fluid in the thoracic cavity . 
No effects attributable to vamorolone were observed in food consumption, ophthalmic examination, or urinalysis during the study.  Dose -dependent decrease in body weight 
gain was observed at all doses; however, weight was fully regained during the recover y 
period.  Adrenal gland weights were variable between groups and generally decreased, 
but without a dose response relationship, and correlated microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_475631].  After the 2 -week recovery period 
there was evidence of vacuolar degeneration of the adrenal gland.  Liver weights were 
significantly increased at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level.  Hepatocellular hypertrophy, 
increased vacuolation, and necrosis (single cell) were seen in a few male mice at 
30 mg/kg/day.  There was evidence of lipid and glycogen accumulation.  Serum alanine 
aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were higher with associated 
microscopic hypertrophy/vacuolation/necrosis at 100 mg/kg/day.  Spleen weights 
decreased in a dose -dependent manner and correlated with a decreased number of 
lymphocytes in spleen.  Thymus weights decreased in a dose dependent manner and were 
associated microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_120684].  Mice had dose -dependent reductions 
in serum l ymphocytes which were significant in the 100 mg/kg dose group.  After the 
recovery period, all parameters returned to normal (untreated) except for thymus weights, 
which were increased.  
Based on the liver -related findings in this study, the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) for vamorolone in mice is 30 mg/kg/day (ReveraGen Report No. 1998- 009).  
Vamorolone or vehicle was administered to beagle dogs once daily for 28 consecutive days at doses of 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day.  All animals survived to their sc heduled

urinalysis parameters at necropsy.  A dose -dependent decrease in the expected normal 
body weight gain was observed at all doses but weights generally increased to a normal level during the recovery period. 
Adrenal gland weights decreased with vamorolone treatment, which correlated with mild 
or moderate diffuse bilateral atrophy of the ad renal cortex, mild multifocal bilateral 
vacuolation of the adrenal cortex, increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, and decreased eosinophil counts.  Liver weights increased in the 50 mg/kg/day dose group, 
which correlated with diffuse hypertrophy  and vacuolation and increased levels of 
alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyltransferase.  Spleen weights decreased, which 
correlated with lymphoid depletion.  Thymus weights decreased, which corresponded to 
diffuse lymphoid depletion.  With the excepti on of diffuse depletion of lymphocytes in 
thymus in the 50 mg/kg group, all abnormal parameters returned to normal during the 
recovery period.  
The NOAEL was considered by [CONTACT_47990] 10 mg/kg/day.  Although reversible, the liver changes were considered adverse at 50 mg/kg/day because the 
severity score was moderate and the changes were diffuse in nature in all animals treated 
at the high dose.  This determination is in contrast to the conclusion drawn by [CONTACT_475660], who considered the NOAEL to be 50 mg/kg/day due to reversibility 
following cessation of dosing (ReveraGen Report No. [ZIP_CODE]).  
Vamorolone or vehicle was administered to beagle dogs once daily for 39 weeks at doses 
of 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day.  Six dogs of each sex received each dose or placebo, and two 
of the six dogs of each sex at each dose o r placebo were followed for an additional 
4 weeks to evaluate reversibility, progression, or delayed appearance of any observed changes.  One male dog that  received 50 mg/kg/day was eutha nized in extremis on Day 
273 due to paraphimosis (an extended penis).  All other animals survived to their 
scheduled termination.  
Detailed clinical observations considered test  article- related at 50 mg/kg/day, and

correlating with increases in food consumption were observed relative to  controls in 
males at all dose levels and in females at 10 and 50 mg/kg/day.  Test article -related, 
reversible increases in average mean food consumption, relative to controls, over the course of the 39- week dose phase were observed in both sexes at  10 and 50 mg/kg/day . 
No test article -related ophthalmological effects were noted.  N o test -article -related

that was significantly different f rom vehicle in both sexes following the 50 mg/kg/day 
dose.  Semen analysis/evaluation for test article affects could not be conducted as there 
were not enough viable s amples collected.  
Test article -related effects on clinical pathology endpoints with microscopic correlates  
included the following:  
• A hepatocellular and hepatobiliary effect in males at 10 mg/kg/day and both sexes 
at 50 mg/kg/day, which included increased a lkaline phosphatase, gamma  
glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase 
activity.  T hese changes correlated with microscopic changes in the liver, bile 
duct, and  gall bladder.  This spectrum of changes was considered advers e in both 
sexes at  50 mg/kg/day.  
• There was also evidence of an inflammatory response in both sexes at  
50 mg/kg/day, which included increased total leukocyte, neutrophil , and 
monocyte counts, and increased fibrinogen and/or globulin concentrations.  The 
inflammatory response was  likely secondary to inflammation in the liver 
associated with hepatocellular necrosis.  Platelet  counts were also increased in 
both sexes at 50 mg/kg/day and may have been secondary to the inflammatory 
response.

Femoral bone marrow was microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_475634] (PCEs) containing micronuclei.  No significant reductions in the  PCEs/EC 
(total erythrocytes) ratio were observed in the vamorolone groups compared to the vehicle control group.  Although statistically significant increases in the incidence of 
micronucleated PCEs in the vamorolone treated groups were observed, no dose response 
was observed with respect to other groups and the values of micronuclei for the 
individual animals were within the historical range.  Therefore, the statistically 
significant increase was considered as biologically insignificant (ReveraGen Report No.

A study was performed to evaluate the potential mutagenicity of two theoretical epoxide impurities related to the drug substance vamorolone (formerly VBP15), which is a 
steroid -like structure containing a delta 9,11 double bond.  The delta 9,11 epoxide 
structures evaluated were VBP15 -B-3, which is structurally similar to vamorolone except 
for the epoxide moiety, and VBP15- B-2, which has a 21- acetate substitution (vamorolone 
and VBP15- B-3 contain a 21- hydroxy moiety).  Two validate d and complementary 
in silico prediction methodologies were used for assessing mutagenic potential.  The 
statistics -based quantitative structure -activity relationship (QSAR) program MultiCASE 
CASE Ultra was used, employing four different modules (GT1_A7B, GT1_AT_ECOLI, 
PHARM_ECOLI, and PHARM_SAL) designed to cover a wide range of molecular 
substructures collected from both proprietary and public compounds.  In addition, the 
expert rule- based SAR program Derek Nexus was used to determine if the theoretical 
impurities contained structural alerts associated with known genotoxicants.  CASE Ultra 
predicted both VBP15- B-2 and VBP15- B-3 as negative for mutagenicity [ReveraGen

1.3 Clinical Experience 
1.3.1 Phase I Study in Healthy Adult Volunteers  
Clinical experience is limited to a single Phase I clinical trial of vamorolone in healthy 
adult volunteers (VBP15- 001).  This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK of  
vamorolone in a Phase I randomized, placebo- controlled, double -blind, single ascending 
dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study .  In the SAD portion of the study, 
Cohorts 1 through 5 and Cohort 7 were comprised of eight subjects each; six subjects in 
each cohort received a single oral dose of vamorolone (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 
3.0 mg/kg, 8.0 mg/ kg, and 20 mg/kg, respectively) and two subjects in each cohort 
received placebo under fasted conditions.  In Cohort 6, six subjects received a single oral dose of 8.0 mg/kg vamorolone within 30 minutes of beginning a high fat/high calorie 
meal.  The MAD p ortion of the study had four cohorts (6 drug, 2 placebo in each) 
receiving 14 daily doses of vamorolone (1.0, 3.0, 9.0 and 20.0 mg/kg/day).  The clinical conduct for all seven SAD cohorts and all four MAD cohorts has been completed. 
The primary objectives of the Phase I study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of vamorolone, and to evaluate the PK of single doses and 
multiple doses of vamorolone.  A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of food 
on the abs orption and PK of vamorolone.  Other objectives were to obtain samples from 
subjects on Day 1 (pre -dose) and Day 14 of the MAD cohorts for use in Metabolites in 
Safety Testing (MIST) assessments, and to test back -up PK samples from a subset of 
MAD subjects  for pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers.

[IP_ADDRESS] MAD Cohorts  
The Phase I MAD t reatment plan was discussed in light of the initial PK data.  The 
relatively short half -life of vamorolone (2 -4 hours), coupled with the planned daily dose 
schedule, would be expected to give PK data on each single dose, not cumulative dose, as 
the dosing interval was >  5 × t½.  Thus, the MAD component would be a study of 
individual daily doses, rather than dose -related accumulation and pharmacodistribution 
related to cumulative drug exposure.  In other words, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_120693] a MAD study is to 
determine s teady state drug levels after multiple doses; yet with the short half -life of 
vamorolone, useful information would not be expected to be gained with the current daily

[IP_ADDRESS].3 Pharmacodynamic Safety Biomarkers  
Vamorolone has shown improved safety profiles relative to prednisone in nonclinical 
testing, both in vitro  and in vivo .
15,17  Safety concerns with glucocorticoids  include 
suppression of the adrenal axis and insulin resistance.  Pharmacodynam ic biomarker 
assays of suppression of the adrenal axis (serum cortisol) and insulin resistance (serum 
glucose) were measured in the Phase I MAD studies of vamorolone.  
Suppression of the adrenal axis.  Prednisone directly impi[INVESTIGATOR_120694] (adrenal axis) both acutely and chronically.  Acute suppression of adrenal 
function is seen within hours of doses of a single 0.1 mg/kg/day (approximate) dose of prednisone, as evidenced by [CONTACT_475663]  (ACTH) levels in 
normal volunteers.25  More chronic suppression of the adrenal axis, characterized as

Vamorolone showed little evidence of either acute (24 hour data), or chronic (Day 15 
data) suppression of the adrenal axis at doses of either 1.0 mg/kg/day or 3.0 mg/kg/day.  
The data suggest that vamorolone induces variable, mild, acute and chronic suppression 
of the adrenal axis at 9.0  mg/kg/day, and stronger evidence of both acute and chronic 
adrenal axis suppression at 20.0 mg/kg/day.  Prednis one typi[INVESTIGATOR_120697] 0.1 mg/kg/day,25 suggesting that

mouse model, where chronic treatment of prednisolone (5 mg/kg/day) versus vamorolone

Bone turnover markers are often used to monitor effects of drugs and other interventions on bone health.  Serum osteocalcin is considered a biomarker for bone formation, where 
prednisone decreases serum levels, and this is correlated with bone  health outcomes.  
Serum CTX1 (C -terminal telo peptide of Collagen 1) is a marker of bone reabsorption, 
prednisone causes increases in serum levels, and these are also correlated with later bone 
health outcomes.  Osteocalcin and CTX1 serum levels were meas ured in the Phase I

respectively.  The PK for the MAD cohorts was very similar to the SAD cohorts, 
showing little if any drug accumulation, consistent with the short half -life and daily  
dosing schedule.

ReveraGen  BioPharma, Inc. –  CONFIDENTIAL  • For the food effect group, a high fat meal was given to a cohort of Phase I SAD 
volunteers with the 8.0 mg/kg dose of vamorolone.  These data were then compared to the fasted 8.0 mg/kg cohort data.  The comparison showed that absorption w as 
increased by 2.5 -fold by [CONTACT_120751], consistent with the lipophilic character 
of vamorolone (steroidal compound).  
• For the MAD cohorts, there were no AEs precluding further escalations in dosing.  
The anticipated therapeutic dose in DMD boys is estimated between 1.0 -
8.0 mg/kg/day, and this is the dose range proposed in the later Phase II first -
in-patient studies.  
• Regarding the primary target organ, liver, one subject on placebo in the 1.0 
mg/kg/day cohort and one subject on vamorolone in the 20 mg/ kg/day cohort 
showed mild elevations of liver enzymes, and drug dosing was halted.  No subjects 
in the 3.0 or 9.0 mg/kg/day MAD cohorts showed elevations of liver enzymes. 
• Safety PD biomarker studies showed that vamorolone had an improved safety 
window for  adrenal axis suppression (100- fold increase in thera peutic window), no 
evidence of insulin resistance,  no changes in bone turnover markers (osteocalcin, 
CTX1),  compared to prednisone studies reported in the literature.

gluco corticoids  have shown that this has increased side effect profiles without a 
significant gain in efficacy.  T hus, the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids  may be 
related to the short -term (pulsed) daily drug exposure.  As vamorolone is thought to share 
a similar anti- inflammatory mechanism of action as glucocorticoids  (NF-κB inhibition), 
it is felt that the daily pulsed exposure in the Phase I MAD is most relevant to the planned clinical trials in DMD including the Phase II MAD and Phase II efficacy/safety studies, 
where daily dosing schedules will be followed.  The option of increasing the dosing 
regimen in the  Phase I MAD to better study drug accumulation and steady state PD was

1.3.2 Pharmacokinetics in Phase II Study in 4 to 7 years Duchenne Muscular 
Dystrophy Bo ys (VBP15 -002) 
Preliminary Assessment of Vamorolone (VBP15) Pharmacokinetics in Boys with DMD : 
Pharmacokinetics has been studied in s ix boys with DMD received 0.25 mg/kg oral doses 
of VBP15 once daily for 14 days.  The drug was administered with milk.  Six  blood 
samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours and plasma was analyzed for VBP15.  
The time -course of plasma drug concentrations were assessed using noncompartmental 
(NCA) methods using the WinNonlin software (Certera).  Selected exposure para meters 
from this limited sampling schedule were compared with those from healthy adult men 
from Study VBP15- 001, who received a range of single and multiple oral doses of 
VBP15.  
The graphs  displayed in Figure [ADDRESS_609825] the plasma concentration versus time profiles for 
all subjects on Days 1 and 14.  The sampling schedule reasonably captured the absorption (upcurve) and disposition (downcurve) profiles with peak concentrations occurring a t 2 to 
4 hours after dosing.  The C
max averaged 18.9 (CV% = 46) on Day 1 and 37.9 (42%) 
ng/mL on Day  14.  The Area Under the Curve ( AUC) with extrapolation  averaged 87.2 
(37%) on Day  1 and 147.9 (27%) on Day 14.  As the zero- time concentrations of VBP15 
were undetectable before dosing  on Day 14 and the half -life of the drug was relatively 
short (5.9 hr o n Day 1 and 3.55 hr on Day 14), the increase in concentrations from Day [ADDRESS_609826] relevant, a comparison of these plasma concentrations 
with da ta from adult men will be made.

The PK of VBP15 did not change from Day 1 to Day 14 in healthy men.  The following 
PK metrics were observed in 6 healthy men who received a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg of 
the drug under fasting conditions:

ReveraGen  BioPharma, Inc. –  CONFIDENTIAL  Cmax = 50.8 (16.5%); T max = 1.5 hr; AUC = 170 (16.5%) ng.hr/mL; t1/2 = 1.60 (17.8%) 
hours; CL/F  = 1.76 (15.5%) L/hr/kg.  
It can be observed that most of these metrics are quite comparable between adult men and 
boys with DMD considering that the dose was about 20% lower in the latter group.  
While normal children typi[INVESTIGATOR_475638] (clearance 
usually relates to body weight as CL = a.BW**0.75 where “a” is a specific constant for 
each drug), the DMD boys may have somewhat low clearances.   The drug exhibits 
markedly increased absorption when ingested with food in adults.  Thus dosing of the 
drug with milk in the DMD boys may produce increased bioavailability as well and 
produce a higher AUC and lower apparent CL/F .  It can be n oted that the mean half -life 
(t1/2) appears much shorter in adults (1.6 hr) than in DMD boys (3.55 hr).  It is likely that 
the longer mean t1/2 is due to prolonged absorption of the drug in 3 subjects as 3 of the 
DMD boys had a more reasonable t 1/2 of about 1.5 hours.  It appears that the variability in 
the PK metrics is slighter greater in the DMD boys than in adults.  However, these 
parameters are expected to be more accurate in the adults owing to collection of more 
time samples (n = 13) versus 6 in the DMD boys.  
Conclusion:  
While the increased exposures of the 0.25 mg/kg doses VBP15 taken with milk on 
Day 14 compared to Day 1 are unexpected, the PK metrics observed on Day 14 in DMD 
boys are remarkably consistent with those from adult men who received single fasting doses of 0.3 mg/kg.  As VBP15 exhibits linear and consistent pharmacokinetics in adult 
men, increasing the dose in DMD boys should also produce predictably cons istent 
increases in exposures.  
1.3.3 Safety in Phase II Studies in 4 to7 years Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Boys

receiving vamorolone 0.75 mg/kg/day), one SAE of bilateral testicular torsion and one 
SAE of hypoxia in the same subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day, and one SAE of influenza 
associated dehydration in a subject receiving  6.0 mg/kg/day.  Each of these SAEs was 
considered unrelated to study drug, and none of them resulted in discontinuation from the study.  In the VBP15- 003 study, there were a total of 218 TEAEs among 42 of the 48 
subjects (87.5%).  In VBP15- [ADDRESS_609827] infection (41.7%); pyrexia (35.4%); cough (18.8%); vomiting 
(14.6%); and diarrhea (10.4%).   
Body Mass Index (BMI):  Body Mass Index was measured throughout the VBP15- 003 
study.   The mean change from baseline to Week 24 for BMI was  0.03, 0.20, 0.23, and 
1.15 for the 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day dose level groups, respectively.  Body 
Mass Index increases generally reflect an increase in weight.  Body Mass Index z -score 
was monitored in the VBP15- 003 study.  The mean change from baseline to Week 24 for 
BMI z -score for the 6.0 mg/kg/day group showed a statistically significant increase 
compared to the mean change from baseline to Week  24 for the 0.25 mg/kg/day and 
0.75 mg/kg/day dose level groups.  In contrast, the mean change from baseline to 
Week  24 for the 2.0 mg/kg/day dose level group in BMI z -score was minimal and 
comparisons with the other vamorolone dose level groups lacked statistical significance.  
The mean increase from baseline to Week 24 for BMI z -score was similar for the 6.0 
mg/kg/day group and a daily prednisone -treated historical control group.  
 
Potential liver toxicity:  In the Phase I clinical trial in adult volunteers, vamorolone 
showed mild elevations of liver enzymes in one subject receiving 20.0 mg/kg in the 
fasted state, and dosing was halted.  All DMD subjects have elevated serum ALT and 
AST enzymes because of the muscle condition.  For that reason, two enzymes, glutamate 
dehydrogenase (GLDH) and gamma glutamyl transf erase (GTT), that are preferentially 
expressed in liver were evaluated in the VBP15 -003 study.  None of the mean changes in 
GLDH from baseline to any of the VBP15- 003 on -treatment assessment time points were 
statistically significant for any dose level gro up.  Although the mean changes from

four dose level groups remained at or below the normal range. On the basis of these mean GLDH and GGT data, vamorolone at dose levels up to 6.0 mg/kg/day does not appear to 
induce liver toxicity over a 24- week treatment period. 
Adrenal suppression:  In the VBP15- 003 study, after 24 weeks of treatment, 0 of 8 tested 
participants (0.25 mg/kg/day), 1 of 12 (8.3%) tested participants (0.75 mg/kg/day), 5 of

(6.0 mg/kg/day) had a depressed morning cortisol (<3.6 μg/dL [100 nM]) consistent with 
chronic adrenal suppression.

Insulin resistance: In the VBP15- 003 study, mean changes from baseline for fasting 
insulin showed dose -and time -related changes for all dose level groups at Week 12 and

tolerable dose(s) of vamorolone  to enable future studies with chronic administration in 
DMD subjects, age d 4-7 years.  The narrow age window for this study is driven by 
[CONTACT_71411]: 1) the average age of diagnosis is still approximately 4.8 years due to lack 
of screening programs; 2) the current standards of clinical care in Western countries , 
where gluco corticoid  therapy is  typi[INVESTIGATOR_475639] 5 and 7 years  of age for DMD 
patients; and 3) the observation that  peak function for DMD patients occurs at around 
7 years  of age  (after which time most affected males with DMD will begin to decline ), all 
of which result in a narrow age window to identify steroid- naive males with DMD.  
Key safety parameters in conjunction with PK data are being evaluated during the course 
of the P hase IIa study to assess vamorolone  safety and tolerability.  Exploratory c linica l 
efficacy  parameters and  PD biomarkers of tissue breakdown and repair  are also being

The vamorolone  development program has made advances in biomarker discovery and 
development in DMD, with a subset of these studies recently published.42  A panel of 
biomarkers in DMD patient sera that show response to chronic (~4 month) treatment with 
glucocorticoids  has been identified.  These chronic prednisone PD biomarkers were 
discovered through study of serum sa mples of DMD patients enrolled in the Cooperative 
International Neuromuscular Research Group ( CINRG ) Duchenne Natural History Study  
(DNHS) , and data have been reported for the VBP15 -002 study .43  SOMAscan aptamer 
panels testing 1,200 serum proteins were used to discover a candidate set of prednisone -
responsive biomarkers, with a subset of these validating in a longitudinal sample set (individual DMD patients pre/post steroid treatment).  These PD  biomarkers were 
assigned to a safety panel or efficacy panel based on comparison to normal controls and information concerning the function of each protein ( Table  7).  All safety biomarkers 
were validated in a separate cohort of p ediatric inflammatory disease patients 
(longitudinal pre/post steroids).  The same SOMAscan assay was used on the chronic 
samples from the vamorolone  Phase IIa trial (entry, 2 weeks  treatment, 2 weeks 
washout), with initial data analyses limited to those v alidated biomarkers shown 
(Table  7).

(approximately 8 grams of fat) , or equivalent high fat food portion.  
The dispensed study m edication bottle (s) will be returned to the study site at each 
subsequent scheduled visit . 
5.4 Rationale for Dose Selection  
Dose levels were chosen for this study to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the 
study, to allow demonstration of efficacy and PD  effects, and to ensure adequate safety in 
future clinical studies and in the patient population after FDA regulatory approval.  All 
dosing will be done in the morning with a glass of whole milk (approximately 8 grams of 
fat) or similar fat equivalent meal.  
Each s ubject will enroll in this long -term extension study to receive the same dose that he 
received at the time the subject completed the Week 24 Visit of the VBP15 -003 core 
study.  The planned dose levels in this study are 0.25 mg/kg, 0.75 mg/kg, 2.0 m g/kg, and 
6.0 mg/kg .  If dose -limiting toxicities are observed in the Phase IIa or Ph ase II a extension 
core studies  at doses being used in this LTE study, dose  level (s) will be de -escalated, as 
appropriate.

of the first dose  of study medication  (Study Day - 1), which includes signing of the 
VBP15 -LTE extension study -specific ICF and HIPAA authorization, if applicable, and 
enrollment into the extension study.   The Baseline Day - 1 Visit will generally coincide 
with the final Week 24 V isit in the VBP15- 003 core study .  Alternatively, subjects  who 
participate in the Dose -tapering Period may return to the study site up to 8 weeks after 
completion of the  VBP15 -003 final asses sments  following the Dose -tapering Period for 
signing of the ICF and HIPAA authorization, if applicable, and completion of Baseline 
assessments at Baseline Day  -1. 
Treatment Period:   The 24- month interval  starting with  administration of the first dose  
of study medication on Study Day  1and continuing through the time of the Month 24 
Visit and administratio n of the final dose of Treatment Period study medication . 
Dose -tapering Period:   The [ADDRESS_609873] their vamorolone dose tapered 
to 0 mg/kg/day.  The length of time required for this tapering will depend upon the dose 
received during the Treatment Period (see Section  6.3.4).  Subjects whose dose is tapered 
during the Dose -tapering Period will be discharged from the study followi ng completion 
of all final Dose -tapering Period assessments.

for reporting protocol deviations  or violations  to the IRB/IEC and Sponsor or designee 
(Coordinating Center) within [ADDRESS_609923] the shorter of the 
following two time periods: 
• Two years after FDA approval of the drug for the indication for which it was 
investigated, or  
• In situations where no application is to be submitted or an application is not approved for such indication, 2 years after the Investigati onal New Drug (IND) 
Application  is discontinued and the FDA is notified. 
The Investigator must maintain a copy of all data collected for each subject treated 
(including eCRFs and source data).  In order to assure the accuracy of data collected in 
the eCRF,  it is mandatory that representatives of the Sponsor, or designee, as well as 
representatives of the FDA or other health authorities have direct access to original 
source documents (e.g., subject records, subject charts, and laboratory reports).  During 
the review of these documents, the anonymity of the subject will be respected with strict 
adherence to professional standards of confidentiality.

ReveraGen BioPharma,  Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Appendix  14.1  Vamorolone  Dose Calculation Worksheet  and Bulk Dispensing 
Guide  
Vamorolone  is administered once daily as a 4% oral suspension.  The volume per dose is 
determined by [CONTACT_423]’s dosing level and body weight (in kg)  at each  study 
medication dispensing visit , as shown by [INVESTIGATOR_8850] 1:  
Equation [ADDRESS_609934] Weight (kg) x Dose Level (mg/kg)  = Subject Dose (in mL)  40 mg/mL  
Subject weight (in kg ) should be rounded to the nearest whole integer for the calculation 
of volume per dose.  
Calculated dose volume will be rounded to the nearest 0.01 mL  (1 mL syringe) , 0.1 mL  
(3 mL syringe), or 0.2 mL  (5 mL syringe) , depending upon the total dose volume and 
calibration of the volumetric syringe to be used for administration of dose, as shown in 
the examples below:  
Example 1:  Dose volume calculation for a subject receiving 0.25 mg/kg/day  with a body 
weight of 27 kg:   
Subject Weight (27 kg) x  Dose Level ( 0.25 mg/kg)  = 0.169 mL 40 mg/mL  
The subject will receive a daily dose volume of 0.[ADDRESS_609935] 0.0 1 mL, or 0.17 mL dai ly. 
Example 2:  Dose volume calculation for a subject receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day with a body 
weight of 23 kg:   
Subject Weight (23 kg) x Dose Level ( 6.0 mg/kg)  = 3.45 mL 40 mg/mL  
The subject will receive a daily dose volume of 3.[ADDRESS_609936] 0.2 mL, or 3.4  mL daily.

Synopsis, Statistical Methods  
Orig inal Text : 
Analysis Populations:  
All analyses will be based on the actual treatment each subject received.  Four  populations will be defined 
for data analysis: the Safety Population, the Full Analy sis Set, the control population CINRG Duchenne 
Natural History Study, and the control population CINRG Prednisone study.  
Safety Population  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of vamorolone study medication in the VBP15 -LTE extension 
study will be in cluded in the Safety Population.  The Safety Population is the primary analysis population 
for safety assessments.  This is also the modified Intention to Treat (mITT) population.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of vamoro lone study medication in the extension study and have 
at least one post -baseline assessment will be included in the FAS.  The FAS is the primary analysis 
population for clinical efficacy and PD assessments.  The FAS population is the mITT population, with the 
additional requirement of having at least one post- baseline assessment.  Subjects who receive at least one 
dose of vamorolone but never have post -baseline assessments will be excluded.  
Control Populations from CINRG Duchenne Natural History Study  
The control population from the CINRG Duchenne Natural History Study will include all subjects who 
w e r e  o b s e r v e d  a s  p a r t  o f  t h e  s t u d y  i n  a g e s  ≥  4 years and <7 years of age at a start of an interval of 
observation; observed for at least one year with at least t wo visits in a time interval of no more than 15 
months with TTSTAND, TTCLIMB, TTRW, NSAA, 6MWT and QMT measured; remained 
glucocorticoid -naive during the entire observation period; and were able to walk independently without 
assistive devices, able to comp lete the TTSTAND; and lacked any history of disease, impairment, or 
medications that would have made them ineligible to receive the vamorolone intervention as defined by [CONTACT_475694]15 -LTE exclusion criteria at the start of the interva l. 
Control Population CINRG Prednisone Study  
The control population from the CINRG Prednisone study will include all subjects who were younger than 7 years old at entry and who were randomized to the daily prednisone arm.  
General Statistical Considerations : 
All measurements will be analyzed based upon the type of distribution and descriptive statistics presented by [CONTACT_11571], as appropriate.  No interim statistical analyses are planned.  Missing 
values for safety and exploratory outcome s will be treated as missing.  
Baseline measurement is defined as the last non -missing value prior to the first dose of study drug in the 
extension study.
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy outcome is TTSTAND.  Secondary efficacy outcomes are the NSAA assessment, 
TTCLIMB, TTRW, QMT, and the 6MWT .  The primary outcome will be compared between vamorolone 
and historical untreated controls using a mixed -effects linear model with treatment group.  Age at study 
entry will be included as a covariate.  The init ial model will compare combined vamorolone doses to 
untreated natural history controls and a subsequent secondary model will compare each dose to untreated natural history controls.  This will allow the testing of whether vamorolone in general and vamorolo ne at 
individual doses have significant effects on the slope of the velocity.  Additional hypotheses of efficacy will include similar linear modelling with the secondary outcomes.  They will also include comparison groups including prednisone -treated or un treated natural history controls.

ReveraGen BioPharma,  Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL  Pharmacodynamics Analyses:  
Serum PD biomarkers of adrenal axis suppression, insulin resistance, and bone turnover will be assessed, as 
well as exploratory biomarkers of safety and efficacy.  Longitudinal analysis of PD bio markers will be 
studied as a function of treatment, with comparison to prednisone -treated and untreated historical controls, 
as appropriate.  
Safety Analyses:  
All evaluations of clinical safety will be listed with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570] p resented.  The 
primary safety variable will be BMI z- score and will be assessed using the same type of statistical models 
used for efficacy.  Additional secondary safety data will include height z -score,  blood pressure, and ECG 
results.  As no change in bl ood pressure or cardiac results is expected, these data will be analyzed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach which includes the baseline value for each measurement as a 
covariate.  Changes in height z -scores, for which an observed change is e xpected, will be modelled using a 
linear mixed effects model .  Continuous, quantitative laboratory values will be analyzed similar to BMI 
z-scores.  Categorized laboratory values and presence or absence of AEs will be compared using an exact 
chi-square tes t.  Adverse events will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_15994], system organ class (SOC) 
and preferred term (using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]); by [CONTACT_475695]; and by [CONTACT_475696] (CTCAE grade).  Additional hypotheses 
of safety will include similar linear modelling with the secondary and exploratory outcomes.

considered unrelated to study drug, and none of them resulted in dis continuation from the 
study.  In the VBP15- 003 study, there were a total of 218 TEAEs among 42 of the 48 
subjects (87.5%).  In VBP15- [ADDRESS_609945] infection (41.7%); pyrexia (35.4%); coug h (18.8%); vomiting 
(14.6%); and diarrhea (10.4%).   
Body Mass Index (BMI):  Body Mass Index was measured throughout the VBP15- 003 
study.   The mean change from baseline to Week 24 for BMI was  0.03, 0.20, 0.23, and 
1.15 for the 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg /day dose level groups, respectively.  Body 
Mass Index increases generally reflect an increase in weight.  Body Mass Index z -score 
was monitored in the VBP15- 003 study.  The mean change from baseline to Week 24 for 
BMI z -score for the 6.0 mg/kg/day group s howed a statistically significant increase 
compared to the mean change from baseline to Week  24 for the 0.25 mg/kg/day and 
0.75 mg/kg/day dose level groups.  In contrast, the mean change from baseline to 
Week  24 for the 2.0 mg/kg/day dose level group in BM I z-score was minimal and 
comparisons with the other vamorolone dose level groups lacked statistical significance.  The mean increase from baseline to Week 24 for BMI z -score was similar for the 6.0 
mg/kg/day group and a daily prednisone -treated historical  control group.  
 
Potential liver toxicity:  In the Phase I clinical trial in adult volunteers, vamorolone 
showed mild elevations of liver enzymes in one subject receiving 20.0 mg/kg in the fasted state, and dosing was halted.  All DMD subjects have elevated serum ALT and 
AST enzymes because of the muscle condition.  For that reason, two enzymes, glutamate

b) Data from untreated subjects in the CINRG DMD Natural history study43,44,45,46 data from treated subjects 
in the CINRG Prednisone trial.47  
c) Compares all only daily dose prednisone -treated patients to untreated patients.  
d) All calculations assume a repeated measu res ANOVA model with one pre - and one post -measurement.  
Correlation between repeated measures used as follows:  0.75 for height changes, 0.70 for 6 month BMI 
changes, and 0.65 for 12 month BMI changes, and 0.575 for 6 and 12 month velocity changes.  
Power  = 0.80 and alpha = 0.025 for all calculations to account for multiple group comparisons (i.e. two 
vamorolone doses, each compared to prednisone for safety and placebo for efficacy).  
^  Conservative change estimates were defined as follows: For BMI, the ex pected change in vamorolone was set to 
0.0 rather than the observed decrease.  For timed tests, the expected change in vamorolone was set to 80% of the 
observed change in the prednisone group.  
^^ Conservative change estimates were defined as follows: For t imed tests, the expected change in vamorolone was 
set to 60% of the observed change in the prednisone group (with SD at 80%).

9.2.2 Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of vamorolone study medication in the 
VBP15 -LTE extension study and have at least one post -baseline assessment will be 
included in the FAS.  The FAS is the primary analysis population for efficacy and PD assessments.  This is the mITT population, with the additional requirement to have at 
least one post -baseline assessment.  Subjects who receive at least one dose of vamorolone 
but never have post -baseline assessments will be excluded.  
9.2.3 Control Population DNHS Study  
The control population from the DNHS study will include all study subjects who were 
observed as part of the study in ages ≥  4 years and <[ADDRESS_609972] two visits in a time interval of no more than 15 months (e.g., Month [ADDRESS_609973] who entered at age 2 or 3).  The subject should 
have been able to walk independently without assistive devices at the s tart of the interval 
and should have been able to complete the TTSTAND.  The subject should not have had any history of disease or impairment or medications that would have made him ineligible 
to receive the vamorolone intervention as defined by [CONTACT_475700]  03 October 2018

the entire interval considered in the control population for this study and should not have 
begun any investigational treatment for the interval consid ered for the control 
comparison.  Finally, the control intervals to be considered should have the study outcomes of TTSTAND, TTCLIMB, TTRW, NSAA, 6MWT and QMT measured.  It is 
acceptable if the participant had progressive disease and could not perform a 
measurement at a later point in the interval; this will be a velocity zero.

All safety data will be listed.  
Baseline measurement is defined as the non -missing value of the core study VBP15- [ADDRESS_609976] administration of study drug in the 
VBP15 -LTE extension study.  
All evaluations of clinical safety w ill be listed with descriptive statistics presented by 
[CONTACT_1570].  The primary safety variable will be BMI z -score and will be assessed 
using the same type of statistical models used for efficacy.  Additional secondary safety 
data will include height  z-score, blood pressure, and ECG results.  As no change in blood 
pressure or cardiac results is expected, these data will be analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) approach which includes the baseline value for each 
measurement as a covariate.  Changes in height z -scores, for which an observed change is 
expected, will be modelled using a linear mixed effects model.  Continuous, quantitative laboratory values will be analyzed similar to BMI z -scores.  Categorized laboratory 
values and presence or  absence of AEs will be compared using an exact chi -square test.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  The incidence of AEs will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_15994], SOC 
and preferred term;  dose level, SOC, preferred term, and intensity (CTCAE grade); and 
dose level, SOC, preferred term, and relationship to study drug.  Additional AE analyses 
will be at the subject level: the number of subjects who had any AE, the distribution of 
number of AEs per  subject within a dose level, worst intensity in a subject within a dose 
level, highest level of relationship to study treatment for each subject within a dose level.  
Additional hypotheses of safety will include similar linear modelling with the secondary 
and exploratory outcomes. 
Physical examination results will be listed only.

Secondary efficacy outcomes are the NSAA assessment, time to climb four stairs 
(TTCLIMB), time to run/walk 10 meters (TTRW), Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT), 
and the distance walked in 6 minutes (6MWT) .  The pr imary outcome will be compared 
between vamorolone and historical untreated controls using a mixed- effects linear model 
with treatment group.  Age at study entry will be included as a covariate.  The initial 
model will combine vamorolone doses and a subsequent secondary model will look at 
each dose in comparison to untreated natural history controls.  This will allow the testing 
of whether vamorolone in general and vamorolone at individual doses have significant 
effects on the slope of the velocity.  Additional hypotheses of efficacy will include 
similar linear modelling with the secondary outcomes.  They will also include differing 
comparison groups including untreated natural history controls. 
Serum PD biomarkers of adrenal axis suppression, insulin resista nce, and bone turnover 
will be assessed.  Longitudinal analysis of PD biomarkers will be studied as a function of 
treatment, with comparison to prednisone -treated and untreated historical controls, as 
appropriate.

 STUDY SUMMARY  
 
In response to RFA -DA-17-014, HIV, HCV and Related Comorbidities in Rural Communities Affected 
by [CONTACT_46242][INVESTIGATOR_571207]: Building Systems for Prevention, Treatment 
and Control (UG3/UH3), our research team  has propose d a multi -phase, mixed -methods study that 
aims to implement and evaluate a novel community response model, which we have named the 
Community -Based, Client -Centered Prevention Home.  
 
Using the organizational infrastructure of a large, multi -site syringe service program serving a 
geographically disperse population of people who inject drugs in rural communities across Northern 
Wisconsin, we will build locally responsive systems to facil itate uptake of evidence -based prevention 
services for high -risk clients. The Client -Centered Prevention Home model incorporates prevention 
case management and mobile health information technology into traditional harm -reduction services 
delivered at syrin ge service programs, which we hypothesize will increase use prevention services. 
During the first [ADDRESS_750208] ( UG3 phase ), we will perform needs assessments in [ADDRESS_750209] a cross -sectional epi[INVESTIGATOR_571208], viral hepatitis 
and sexual ly transmitted infections. Contingent upon meeting recruitment an d data collection goals, 
during years 3 -5 (UH3 phase ) of the p roject we will deploy and evaluate the Client -Centered 
Prevention Home model in the [ADDRESS_750210] 
because of our team’s state -wide reach, broad access to at -risk individuals, and robust infrastructure 
for conducting a rigorous, multi -site evaluation of our proposed model.

 1.0 BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE  
 
HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_571209]. In the past decade, HCV surpassed HIV/AIDS as 
the leading cause of infectious death among U.S. adults,[ADDRESS_750211] 
whether a novel community response model, the Client -Centered Prevention Home, can improve 
uptake of essential prevention services when implemented in syringe service programs serving rural 
communities.  
 
1.1 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_571210], family members, and 
communities.  In the U.S. in 2012, an estimated 2.1 million people had opi[INVESTIGATOR_571211] 467,000 to heroin.16 Healthcare costs related to prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_571212] $25 billion in 2007, and total societal costs at $55.7 billion.17 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_571213]. From 1991 to 2013, opi[INVESTIGATOR_571214] 76 million to 207 million.18 
Emergency department visits related to the nonmedical use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_571215] 144,600 in 2004 to 
305,900 in 2007.19 From 2000 to 2013, unintentional prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_571216].20  
 
In Wisconsin (WI), increases in opi[INVESTIGATOR_571217], and are accompanied by [CONTACT_571285] 
(Figure 1 ). The proportion of drug and alcohol treatment 
admissions in WI for heroin and other opi[INVESTIGATOR_571218] 
2005 and 2014.21 In late 2010, WI detected a cluster of new 
HCV infections in six contiguous rural counties, driven 
primarily by [CONTACT_571286][INVESTIGATOR_571219] 30.22 In 2014, 53% of HCV infections in young people 
and 42% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_571220].  
 
1.2. Increases in opi[INVESTIGATOR_571221] a failure to translate evidence into 
practice. Although the global epi[INVESTIGATOR_571222],23 
there is scientific consensus about a package of evidence -based interventions that are efficacious for 
preventing the spread of HIV. The World Health Organization (WHO), The United Nations office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the Joint United Nations Pr ogramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have 
endorsed universal access to [ADDRESS_750212] issued technical 
guidance for evaluation monitoring of this goal.24 This “Comprehensive Package,” listed in Table 1 , 
includes biomedical interventions (e.g. HIV antiretroviral therapy, viral hepatitis immunizations) that 
tend to be delivered in health care settings, and lower -cost, “harm reduction” strategies such as 
needle and syringe programs that are in most cases d elivered in community -based, non -clinical 
settings.

 Medication -assisted treatment (MAT) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], referred to as opi[INVESTIGATOR_63579] 
(OST) in the WHO document, has demonstrated significant clinical, societal, and financial impact 
through increased abstinence rates,25,[ADDRESS_750213] due to limited physician prescribing 
capacity.31,32  
 
1.3. Rural opi[INVESTIGATOR_571223]. Formative research 
by [CONTACT_571287], while comparable numbers of rural and urban syringe service program (SSP) 
clients reported they had never been tested for HCV, geographic inaccessibility appeared to play a 
particularly important role among rural clients.33,34 We found that for every 10 miles a rural client lived 
from the location of a SSP, the odds of ever being tested for HCV decreased by 20%,[ADDRESS_750214] in rural areas.  
 
1.4. Theoretical frameworks  
 
Framework for UG3 Phase: A social ecologic model 
of prevention services delivery.   The social -ecological 
framework, drawn from ecological systems theory40 
(Figure 2 ), guides many public health prevention 
efforts. This framework posits that targeted outcomes 
are influenced by [CONTACT_571288]: (1) 
individual, (2) interpersonal, (3) community, and (4) 
societal. Our community response model serving opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d 
drug users incorporates aspects of care at all four 
levels. Societally, the legality of SSPs, laws governing 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_571224], and safe access to treatment 
services, including methadone or buprenorphine , can impact safe injection drug use and/or treatment. 
On a community level, stigmas associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], HIV/HCV testing, and drug treatment can 
impede willingness to access available services. Interpersonally, social support for safe injection use  
within drug using networks can influence injection practices or help people access support services. 
Individually, people who inject opi[INVESTIGATOR_571225], such as lack of health 
insurance, employment, and low education.  Table [ADDRESS_750215] drugs

Framework for UH3 Phase:  Applying the Chronic Care Model to comprehensive prevention 
services . Recognition of opi[INVESTIGATOR_571226] a chronic, relapsing condition in need of 
management over the life -course is a fundamental component of effective prevention strategies for 
people who inject opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. The U.S. health system currently has critical def iciencies in its capacity to 
meet the prevention needs of rural opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]. There have, however, been important lessons 
learned over the past decade about how s ystems of care can be improved overall to better deliver 
treatment for complex, chronic health problems. The current opi[INVESTIGATOR_571227] “fill the gaps” left by [CONTACT_571289]. To have 
optimal impact, these new models should incorporate evidence -based strategies known to effectively 
meet the needs of people with chronic conditions.  
 
The Chronic Care Model --developed in the early 2000s 
as part of initiatives to reduce costs and improve 
outcomes for treatment of diabetes, heart failure, and 
other conditions --emphasizes a team -based, longitudinal 
care approach.41,42 The model’s 6 elements emphasize 
patient empowerment, community engagement, and 
efficient use of information resources to enhance quality 
of services ( Table 2 ). While the Chronic Care Model was 
designed to improve medical care for complex chronic 
illnesses, its central features are clearly applicable to 
prevention services.43 In the following sections, we 
describe how this framework is applied to the proposed 
model of Client -Centered Prevention Homes within SSPs.  
 
1.5. The Community -Based, Client -Centered Prevention Home  incorporates elements of the 
Chronic Care Model into the delivery and coordination of community -based services to prevent HIV, 
viral hepatitis, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]. It leverages unique strengths of community -based organizations, 
and SSPs in particular, to  engage marginalized and stigmatized communities that are underserved by 
[CONTACT_571290]. It also seeks to enhance the quality, efficiency, and reach of community -
based services by [CONTACT_571291] -based strategies shown to improve chronic ill ness 
management in primary care clinical settings.  
 
Client -centeredness  refers to services that are “culturally competent,” “linguistically specific,” and 
tailored to the client’s stage of behavior change.[ADDRESS_750216].  
Prevention Case Management  is a client -centered intervention combining intensive risk reduction 
counseling and case management to people at high risk for HIV infection.45 Evidence from 
demonstration projects, including data published by [CONTACT_571292]/HIV program,[ADDRESS_750217] also shown benefit by [CONTACT_571293]50 and other unmet service needs,51 
and by [CONTACT_571294].50 Care coordination strategies Table 2 . Six Elements of the Chronic Care Model 
applicable to opi[INVESTIGATOR_571228]  
1. Health Systems : Create an organization that provides 
safe, high -quality services  
2. The Community : Mobilize community resources to 
meet the needs of clients  
3. Self-Management : Empower and prepare clients to 
manage their health needs  
4. Delivery System Design: Assure effective, efficient 
service and self -management support  
5. Decision support: Promote services consistent with 
scientific data and client services  
6. Health information systems : Organize data to 
facilitate efficient and effective services  
 
[ADDRESS_750218] been shown to be effective for linking patients 
receiving methadone maintenance to hepatitis prevention and care services.52 
 
Health homes  seek to integrate and coordinate services using a person -centered philosophy. 
Introduced in 1967 by [CONTACT_21978], the concept has since expanded to 
describe care that can be operationally characterized as accessible , comprehensive , family -centered , 
coordinated , compassionate  and culturally effective .53 Developed and endorsed by [CONTACT_571295] U.S. in 2007, the Patient -Centered Medical Home 
approach is now actively promoted by [CONTACT_229334] (AHRQ) as a 
standard of excellence in p rimary care.54 In WI, the State AIDS/HIV Program and Vivent Health  
collaborated with the state legislature to gain approval for the Wisconsin Health Home State Plan 
Amendment (SPA), taking advantage of the opportunity provided under the Affordable Care Act of 
2010 for states to receive funding for “coordinated care throug h a health home for individuals with 
chronic conditions.”55  
 
The Wisconsin SPA, one of only 26 Medicaid Health Homes approved to date in the U.S., focuses 
exclusively on comprehensive care coordination for people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and at least one 
other chronic condition.56 Vivent Health , as the lone agency administering Medicaid Health Home  
services for people living with HIV/AIDS in Wisconsin, is ideally positioned to translate its service 
coordination expertise into prevention home services  to people who inject opi[INVESTIGATOR_571229]. The proposed prevention home model is inspi[INVESTIGATOR_571230] - centered medical home, but its scope is limited to coordination of essential services 
needed to prevent HIV, hepatitis, and other consequences of opi[INVESTIGATOR_571231]  (see Table 3 ). It is not 
an alternative to comprehensive medical care; rather, the prevention home model is an adjunct to 
clinic -based care for a specific population  with extraordinary prevention needs , in the context of a 
public health crisis . Next, we describe enhancements to traditional SSP services which form the 
foundation of the Client -Centered Prevention Home model.  
 
1.6 COVID -19 Outbreak and Amended Intervention (Aim 3)  
In February [ADDRESS_750219] increased efforts in testing for HIV and tracking new 
HCV infections. Concurrently, an increase  in new cases  of the novel Coronavirus, or COVID -19, 
began to appear throughout the state . On March 13, 2020, Wisconsin reported 18 confirmed cases Table 3. Emphasized features of medical and prevention health homes

[ADDRESS_750220] year of the COVID -19 pandemic , which  collided with a worsening, 
ongoing overdose epi[INVESTIGATOR_571232] 9,260 people in Wisconsin from 2000 -2019 from opi[INVESTIGATOR_571233]. Consistent with national and state -level trends indicating increases in fatal and 
nonfatal overdoses ,65,66 overdose mortality in Wisconsin increased by 28% during [ADDRESS_750221] drugs in Wisconsin conducted by [CONTACT_571296] -May 
2021 indicated that 50% of respondents were hesitant to be vacc inated for COVID -19, consistent with 
prior studies .[ADDRESS_750222] drugs (e.g., 
hepatitis A and B70). The extent to which people who inject drugs have accessed other recommended 
vaccines (i.e., hepatitis A and B) is also unknown, yet has important implicatio ns for understanding 
access to preventive care during the COVID -[ADDRESS_750223] is to leverage our team’s successful track record of research, 
surveillance, and service delivery in Wisconsin to implement an innovative yet widely replicable 
service delivery model for rural opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155], which we ha ve named the Community -Based, Client -
Centered Prevention Home . The key features of this approach are its implementation in community -
based organizations  rather than traditional clinical settings, its focus on client -centered service 
coordination , and the i ncorporation of a mobile health (mHealth) information system  to optimize 
quality  and comprehensiveness . Building on our prior success engaging “hidden” populations of rural 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_571234], our specific aims are:  
Aim1:  To estimate the prevalence of HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections among 
people who inject drugs to get high , and the availability of essential prevention services, in 6 rural 
Wisconsin counties.  
 
10 
 Aim 1a: To quantify the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on participants by [CONTACT_571297] -19, overdose, and vaccination rates and risk and protective factors for these outcomes. 
We will achieve this aim via linkage of identifiable information from Aim 1  participants with 
several registries from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (vital records, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53395], Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System, Wisconsin 
Immunization Registry).  
 
Aim 2:  To comprehensively assess unmet needs and available resources for the provision of 
essential prevention services for people who inject drugs to get high  in rural communities:  
Aim 2a – We will analyze diverse sources of public health surveillance and administrative data to 
characterize areas at greatest community -level vulnerability to worsening epi[INVESTIGATOR_571235] . 
 
Aim 2b  – We will engage key stakeholders from affected communities to identify provider -level 
characteristics that facilitate person -centered (e.g. relationship -based, culturally sensitive) service 
delivery.  
 
Aim 2c – We will use ethnographic methods and validated questionnaires to describe individual -
level barriers to optimal engagement in prevention and treatment services.  
Aim 3:  To evaluate the impact of the Client -Centered Prevention Home model, deployed within 
syringe service programs in counties with high burden of injection  drug use , on the proportion of 
clients who receive the package of 9 essential services endorsed by [CONTACT_571298]/HCV in people who inject drugs. We will use input from local stakeholders and a proven 
implementation science framework (NIATx) to translate lessons learned through Aims [ADDRESS_750224] will be conducted by [CONTACT_50210], interdisciplinary team working across academic, 
public health, and non -governmental sectors. The main community partner  Vivent Health , formerly 
known as  the AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin (ARCW) , is a unique, state -wide organization that 
provides harm reduction services, including syringe services and confidential HIV and HCV testing, to 
clients at [ADDRESS_750225] University will 
collaborate to refine study methodologies and adapt data collection and laboratory infrastructure 
during the fall of 2017, with a goal of commencing recruitment of su bjects in January 2018.

 Investigators will also participate in national working groups as part of a multi -site collaborative 
agreement including researchers in other states and Scientific Staff from the National Institute  on

Phase 2 (UH3) Objectives  
Participants in the intervention will undergo a [ADDRESS_750226] meeting, participants and 
prevention navigators will develop a discharge plan that will enable the participant to work on their 
goals on their own.  
 
COVID -19 Response  and Amended Intervention . Wisconsin’s Shelter in Place mandate has 
statewide closure effects, including the limiting of services delivered by [CONTACT_571299], our main 
community partner. To best respond to this crisis and help PWID in rural WI, we will adjust our 
prevention navigation model to a virtual, COVID -19 risk related navigation  for a short period of time  
(through Sep 2020) .  
 
Participants enrolled in the COVID -19 virtual navigation study will work with a navigator 4 times over 
the course of one month (1x/week) to reduce the risk of HIV, HCV, and overdose during this 
especially difficult time . Navigation will be focused on crisis response, safe drug seeking and sharing 
behaviors, at home HIV and HCV testing, overdose risk reduction, safe housing, stable food sources, 
and other relevant topi[INVESTIGATOR_571236] . After a trial of this model  (ending Sep 2020) , 
we will resume the original UH3 model (3 month intervention, and baseline, 3 -month, and 6 -month 
assessments) in a virtual format.

3.0 SELECTION OF SUBJECTS  
In preparation for this study, our team analyzed WI county -level data reflecting various aspects of the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_571237] (1) understand geographic heterogeneity of opi[INVESTIGATOR_571238]; (2) build capacity to monitor 
changes in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related disease burden over time on a state -wide level; and (3) establish a 
framework to assess the impact of the community response model in counties served by [CONTACT_571300]. In Table 4, we list the [ADDRESS_750227] selected as high -
priority candidates for implementation of the Client -Centered Prevention Home model. They were

[ADDRESS_750229] selected 3 service regions for 
which the intervention will be ideally suited. The 3 study sites include La Crosse County, Marathon 
County, and Brown County.   
 
In addition to confirming there are sufficient resources in the study areas, our research showed that 
the 3 selected communities differ from each other in notable ways, which will provide opportunities to 
study how implementation strategies may differ in v arying contexts. For example, Brown County was 
unique in that the RDS survey engaged a much higher than expected number of Native American 
respondents. Respondents in Brown County also more commonly listed heroin as their “drug of 
choice,” while respondent s in all other sites indicated methamphetamine was their preferred drug.

4.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
Participant recruitment for Aim 1 (UG3 Phase).  
Using a cross -sectional study design, we will enroll 1,[ADDRESS_750232] 1 month, and reside in a rural 
community. Rural residence will be determined by [CONTACT_571302], which will be programmed in the 
screening instrument on REDCap.  The system will classify the ZIP code as rural if the ZIP Code 
RUCA Approximation is >4 or the participant lives in a catchment ZIP code for the SSP.  
A research assistant will screen clients for eligibility, either on site at Vivent Health or by [CONTACT_648]. 
Vivent Health staff will notify clients of the opportunity to speak with research staff by [CONTACT_571303] 4. County -level data describing opi[INVESTIGATOR_571240].

[ADDRESS_750233] strategy for managing the flow of 
clients and study participants. Specifically:  
1. As a matter of routine (i.e. independently of the study), syringe program staff collect the 
following information from clients: Age, zip code of residence, whether the client is actively 
injecting drugs, whether they are interested in referrals to drug treatment. Staff members also 
participate in several outreach testing events that are outside of the SSP centers, while testing for 
HCV and HIV at these events, staff collect information on age, zip code of residence, and whether 
the client is actively inj ecting drugs. During the study enrollment period, staff will notify clients of 
the opportunity to participate in the study if they report that they inject drugs, are [ADDRESS_750234]

needed for the study will be securely transmitted to researchers at the time of data analysis.  
Recruitment via respondent -driven sampling (RDS).  Upon study completion, participants will be 
asked to refer up to [ADDRESS_750235] drugs to get 
high.  
Seeds will receive $20 remuneration for survey participation on the day of enrollment, and will receive 
$10 for each eligible peer recruit who enrolls in the study. With customization of existing RDS coupon 
software, 57 computerized tracking of study coupons allows monitoring recruitment chains, allocation 
 
16 
 of incentives, and collection of data necessary to generate weighted sample statistics. By [CONTACT_571307], we will be able to limit or accelerate the rate of 
referrals, which assists in maintaining appropriate w orkload of SSP and research staff and achieving 
recruitment goals.  
 
Participant recruitment for Aim 2 (UG3 Phase).  
 
The research team will conduct individual elicitation interviews with SSP clients, SSP staff, and local 
professionals involved in providing prevention and treatment services to people who use drugs in each 
of the [ADDRESS_750236] drugs. This will allow us to build a referral 
network for provider interviews (Aim 2b), and to complete the local needs assessment.  
 
A quantitative assessment of provider -level barriers will be conducted via a mail and email based 
survey among family medicine providers in WI in order to characterize barriers to optimal care and 
investigate opportunities to reduce health disparities among people who inject drugs (PWID). We will 
survey approximately 1,[ADDRESS_750237] a practice location in 
Wisconsin, as identified through an electronic database purchased from SK&A. To make specific 
comparisons among providers who have adopted office -based buprenorphine treatment (OBBT) in 
their primary care practice to those who have not, we will use a case -control stu dy design, matching 
providers who have received a DEA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to up to [ADDRESS_750238] been identified through the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Administration’s (S AMHSA) website. SAMHSA’s database will be 
crosschecked by [CONTACT_571308]. We theorize that providers who have adopted office -based 
buprenorphine treatment have general awareness of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], and understanding barriers they 
face may be imperative. Controls (non DEA -waivered providers) will be drawn from the SK&A 
database. To achieve the target sample size of 1,500 providers, additional family medicine physicia ns 
will be sampled from the database, with priority given to providers practicing in the rural counties 
targeted in the parent study.  
 
SSP clients will be recruited for individual -level interviews (Aim 2c) among participants who consent 
to participate in the client survey and seroprevalence study, described in Aim 1. Clients who 
participate in the cross -sectional study described above wil l be systematically invited (e.g., every nth 
person) to also participate in a qualitative interview. We anticipate conducting qualitative interviews 
with 5% of the cross -sectional sample (n=60) divided among the 6 counties. Additional interviews will 
be co nducted if warranted by [CONTACT_571309] a sample size of 30 -50 is usually sufficient to achieve 
saturation and redundancy, a marker of sufficient sample size. 58 
 
Participant recruitment for Aim 3 (UH3 Phase, 2019 -2021).  
Based on preliminary data, burden of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related illness, and familiarity with supportive local 
stakeholders, we selected La Crosse County, Marathon County, and Brown County as the 
implementation sites for this study. Eau Claire, Douglas, and Outagamie Counties will serve as the 
 
[ADDRESS_750239] the intervention. Participants in this phase of 
the study will be recruited into one of t wo groups, 
Prevention Navigation , or usual services . Beginning 
in year 3, SSP clients at the 6 selected Vivent Health 
sites will be notified about the study  by [CONTACT_571310] 1) tests for HCV 
or HIV at the SSP, 2) inquires a bout services that 
may be in the prevention home through casual 
conversation, 3) the client engages in naloxone 
training, 4) through posted materials of the availability 
of new resources for improving prevention services 
and linkages to treatment  in the SSP and community 
offices , 5) recruit through flyers and posted materials 
in the SSP and local community resource offices , and 
public areas , 6) through Vivent  Health Facebook 
advertisements , 7) through our study website listed 
on our flyers , and/or 8)  through respondent -driven 
sampling (RDS). Upon the completion of the first two 
attended Prevention Navigation sessions, 
participants will be given  a referral coupon and asked to refer one eligible peers per coupon to 
participate in the study. Vivent Health will dispense coupons that have been prepared by [CONTACT_571311].  SSP clients at the nonintervention sites will be recruited at the time the Vivent Health 
staff member assists them with regular exchange services. Nonintervention sites will aim to enroll  
about one participant every -other week.

Eligibility screening and enrollment at baseline.  Individuals will be eligible for enrollment if they 
are [ADDRESS_750240] 1 month, and reside in a 
rural community. All persons who access services at the northern Wisconsin SSPs will be considered 
rural community members, so long as they reside in the state of Wisconsin. County of residence and 
zipcode will be collected, stored in the participant file, and recorded in REDCap.  

 
18 
 Among nonintervention sites, eligibility criteria will be the same as intervention sites, with the 
exception of allowing Minnesota residents to participate in the Douglas County office.  
At intervention sites the PN will administer the screening questionnaire in person  or over the phone  
with the client. If the PN is not available, the client may answer the screening questionnaire on their 
own and immediately validate their answers with the PN before eligibility is determined  (not applicable 
if virtual) . Eligibility requirements will not be listed or shared with the clients. The screening 
questionnaire has been uploaded as part of the application. If the PN is unavailable, Vivent Health 
SSP staff will also be research trained and able to administer the screening questionnaire  in person 
or over the phone .  
If clients are determined to be eligible, then the research staff will collect their name [CONTACT_18131], 
and assign them a study ID number. They will then provide detailed information about the 
intervention, study procedures, and the consent document.  
If the client agrees to participate, they will be read a verbal  consent  script over the phone, by [CONTACT_571312], or in -person by [CONTACT_571313], SSP staff, or UW staff. They will be required to 
answer T/F questions  regarding the consent before giving verbal consent . Participants will fill out a 
locator form at this time to help SSP staff contact [CONTACT_571314].  
Rapid testing for HIV  and hepatitis C will be conducted by [CONTACT_571315], using standard 
procedures determined by [CONTACT_571305].  The data 
collection forms used by [CONTACT_571316]. Study forms will be securely transmitted to researchers 
after each research assessment.  
Clients at the nonintervention sites who are determined to be eligible after SSP staff administer the 
screening questionnaire will have their name [CONTACT_571384] a study ID 
number. The SSP or UW staff member will go through the study procedures and  read a verbal 
consent script over  the phone, b y video conference, or in -person . They will be required to answer T/F 
questions  regarding the consent before giving verbal consent . A locator form will be filled out at this 
time. Rapid testi ng for HIV  and hepatitis C will be conducted by [CONTACT_571317].  The data collection forms will again be shared with the research 
team securely after each research assessment.  
All clients who are determined to be eligible will have a SSP or UW staff member go through the 
ACHESS specific activities (surveys and option activities) and read a verbal consent script over the 
phone, by [CONTACT_152577], or in -person. The participant w ill be required to provide verbal consent.  
COVID -19 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_473794] . Participants will be recruited to the virtual prevention navigation 
implementation  pi[INVESTIGATOR_571242].  
1) Participants who participated in phase [ADDRESS_750241] will be recruited  for 
the study  
2) Clients who access current SSP services will receive a flyer in their safe injection supply bags 
with contact [CONTACT_571318]  
 3) SSP staff may engage clients about the study if a client calls into the SSP asking for services  
Participants will be eligible for enrollment if they are [ADDRESS_750242] a case load of no 
more than 15 participants at one time to ensure workload is manageable , with a final recruitment

 number of n=108 intervention participants and n=108 control participants . Navigators may take down 
a client’s phone number, per Vivent Health policy, in order to contact [CONTACT_571319].  
We will pause recruitment for our originally proposed UH3 protocol until at least Sep [ADDRESS_750243] a cross -sectional prevalence study among residents of rural communities in the 
catchment areas surrounding 6 Vivent Health Prevention Offices (Figure 3). Four of these offices are 
located in counties (E au Claire, La Crosse, Marathon, Outagamie) classified by [CONTACT_571320] (NCHS) as rural. Douglas and Brown Counties are not classified as rural by [CONTACT_571321], MN and Green Bay, WI, respectively. Both counties 
have total populations of fewer than 250,[ADDRESS_750244].  
Rapid testing for infectious diseases.  Upon enrollment, participants will provide 3 fingerstick whole 
blood samples for rapid testing of HIV, HCV and syphilis. Vivent Health prevention staff are trained to 
perform point -of-care tests for these infections using the Alere Determine ™ HIV-1/2 Ag/AB Combo 
(Alere Inc., Waltham, MA); the OraQuick® HCV Rapid Antibody Test (OraSure Technologies, 
Bethlehem, PA); and the Syphilis Health Check ™ (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Co Wicklow, Ireland), 
respectively. During the [ADDRESS_750245] results, participants will complete an 
interviewer -administered survey (described below). If all [ADDRESS_750246] a blood specimen to be sent to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH) for 
confirmatory testing, record multiple method s of re -contact[CONTACT_571322], and arrange a follow -up visit 
to review confirmatory test results and provide linkage to care, if needed. In the event that a 
participant cannot provide a blood specimen for confirmatory testing due to poor venous access, the y 
will be invited to return at a later date for another blood draw attempt. Those confirmed to have active 
HIV, HCV, or syphilis infection will be linked to a local provider with the assistance of a Vivent Health 
case manager.  
Laboratory -based confirmatory testing and specimen handling.  Specimens received by [CONTACT_571323] (see Facilities and Resources for 
details). After completing the required testing and reporting test results to the testing agency and the 
WI Surveillance System,  WSLH staff will store plasma specimens in preparation for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_571243]/or GHOST laboratories, as described in Section 5.[ADDRESS_750247] shown that this is essential for ensuring study protocol fidelity, maintaining 
high-quality data collection, and maximizing client willingness to participate. We will take advantage of 
existing data collection forms that are used during HIV and HCV testing encounters to capture 
necessary individual -level data elements. All publicly -funded HIV testing sites in WI are required to 
use a uniform data collection and reporting system called Evalua tion Web (Luther Consulting, LLC, 
Carmel, IN). Rapid HCV testing supported by [CONTACT_571324] -level data 
 
20 
 using the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS). With participant consent, the 
paper data collection forms used to capture the required demographic and risk behavior information 
will be transmitted to the UW -Madison based study coordinat or via secure fax -to-PDF system, and 
will be stored on an encrypted server in a directory separate from other study data.  
Additionally, the laboratory infrastructure upon which the Wisconsin UG3 study was developed allows 
an opportunity to undertake a broader epi[INVESTIGATOR_571244]. All blood samples c ollected for HCV RNA confirmatory testing in 
the state of Wisconsin undergo testing at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH). The 
WSLH retains serum specimens from positive and negative confirmatory HCV RNA tests for up to [ADDRESS_750248] days and develop an “on call” system to facilitate [ADDRESS_750249] of short answer and multiple choice 
questions designed to efficiently assess drug us e history, access and utilization of prevention 
services, and injection related risk behaviors (see Appendix 2  for proposed measures).  
To maximize willingness of clients to participate within the context of a routine Vivent Health 
prevention encounter, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test the survey to ensure it can be completed within [ADDRESS_750250]. The University of Washington Data Harmonization Coordinating Center (DCC) 
will be harmonizing data across eight sites in order to create new, combined datasets to be used for 
analyses across the consorti um. Only data from this study (#2017 -0866) will be sent to the DCC from 
UW-Madison.  
Harmonization means the DCC will be combining similar data domains and questions across all sites 
in order to build large data sets that will be useful in answering questions that individual sites are not 
able to answer alone, either due to the nature of t he question or sample size limitations.  The 
University of Washington and other grantees will perform data analyses on these data for peer -
reviewed publication. The harmonized datasets will be provided to other investigators funded under 
this study as requ ired for analysis and will be considered under the umbrella of mandated DCC 
activities.  
Upon execution of the agreement, the team’s data manager will upload study datasets to the Rural 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_571245] (ROI) Upload Server through a web interface. Access to the interface is controlled by 
[CONTACT_571325]. Access is assigned to individu al, designated ROI staff by [CONTACT_2374] 
 
21 
 of Washington Data Coordinating Center (DCC).  The web page uses the HTTPS protocol to transfer 
ROI data files securely to the Upload Server. HTTPS transfers are encrypted using Transport Layer 
Security (TLS, the successor to SSL), protecting the data en r oute to the server. The Upload Server is 
managed in accordance with the DCC’s information security policies (https://uwcirg.github.io/hipaa -
policies), and authorization for specific DCC staff is based on their project -related needs and 
responsibilities.  
Data documentation will also be uploaded in the form of a data dictionary specifying all data elements 
within the dataset, including their description, valid values, and data type. Upon receipt of the dataset 
and documentation, the DCC data manager will wo rk with the Wisconsin ROI data manager to 
understand the data structures so that the DCC may harmonize the dataset with those from other 
sites. A list of data elements that will be sent to the DCC is included in Appendix 3.  
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_750251] Among  
UG3 Participants  
We will use data collected by [CONTACT_571326] S ervices (DHS)  to estimate the 
rates of COVID -[ADDRESS_750252] COVID -19, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B in the UG3 cohort.  To achieve our 
objectives, we propose a retrospective cohort study that will be facilitated by [CONTACT_571327]3 participants. We propose to provide DHS colleagues with identifiable data 
from 991 of our  prior research participants (identifiers: participant name, date of birth, gender, race, 
ethnicity, previous address, previous phone number, date of participation in our study) to facilitate 
linkage with several DHS registries. We are seeking approval for the DHS data linkage via a partial 
waiver of authorization, waiver of consent, and by [CONTACT_571328] a log of the protected health 
information  provided to DHS  per standardized disclosure logs (see here: 
https://compliance.wisc.edu/wp -content/uploads/sites/102/2019/02/Accounting -for-Disclosures -Log-
Research.pdf ). The linkage process is described below:   
1. UW will provide a dataset containing a unique study identification number and participant name, 
date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, previous address, previous phone number, and date of study 
participation to colleagues at DHS.  Table 6. Quantitative measures collected for Aim 1

 2. DHS will link identifiers with vital records data to identify the date (from study participation date 
through present day) and cause of any deaths that have occurred among participants of our prior 
study, from study participation date through present da y. 
3. DHS will link identifiers with COVID -19 data captured in WEDSS to identify the date of any COVID -
19 tests, confirmed or probable infections, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
4. DHS will link identifiers with WIR to identify the dates of all COVID -19 vaccination doses received 
and type of vaccine (brand or whether an mRNA/adenovirus vector vaccine).  
5. DHS will link identifiers with WIR to identify the dates of all vaccine doses for hepatitis A or B 
received (including doses received before study participation, if possible).  
6. DHS will link identifiers with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571246].  
7. DHS will remove and destroy identifiers and return the dataset(s) to UW containing the unique 
study identification number.  
8. UW researchers will link the new dataset with variables collected in our prior cross -sectional survey 
using the unique study identification number, including sociodemographic (i.e., age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, housing, education, employment, income, ma rital status, health insurance coverage) 
and behavioral correlates (i.e., substances used and mode of use, mental health indicators and 
symptoms, addiction treatment history, personal and witnessed overdose history, awareness of how 
to respond to an overdo se and access to naloxone, self -reported HIV and hepatitis C infection and 
treatment, where the participant primarily receives medical care, barriers to engaging in medical care, 
criminal justice involvement history, access to the internet and a cell phone , and self -stigma).  
We will also be requesting that DHS provide an  aggregate data set with COVID -19 data to facilitate 
comparison of COVID -19 burden between  the general population of Wisconsin and UG3 participants . 
Specifically, we  will with monthly age -, sex -, racial/ethnic -, and county -stratified numbers of COVID -
19 tests, vaccinations, confirmed or probable infections, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and deaths for Wisconsin 
(i.e., fully stratified by [CONTACT_571329] v ariables within each county). For 
the vaccinat ion outcome, we would like to have the number vaccinated with 2 doses of mRNA or 1 
dose of Johnson&Johnson and the number with a 3rd mRNA dose or second shot of any type 
following 1 dose of a [COMPANY_012] vaccine. We hope to obtain the following categ ories of age 
(18-29, 30 -39, 40 -49, 50 -59, 60 -69, 70+), race/ethnicity (Non -Hispanic/Unknown ethnicity + white, 
Non-Hispanic/Unknown ethnicity + African American, Non -Hispanic/Unknown ethnicity + American 
Indian or Alaskan Native, Non -Hispanic/Unknown ethni city + Other or Multiple races, Hispanic + any 
race), sex (male, female) within each county in Wisconsin by [CONTACT_24473], beginning March 1, [ADDRESS_750253] estimates of the monthly population size within each stratum.  
5.2. Global Hepatitis Outbreak Surveillance Technology (GHOST).  
This research study is part of a collaboration with scientists at other institutions including the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Global Hepatitis Outbreak and 
 
23 
 Surveillance Technology (GHOST) Center located at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard. 
Blood collected as part of the testing for HIV, Hepatitis and Syphilis may be sent to these other 
institutions for additional testing. These research tests inclu de, but are not limited to, HIV, HCV, 
Syphilis and/or other tests for research purposes only. All blood and information will be coded with a 
number and no directly identifiable information will be shared outside of UW -Madison. The GHOST 
lab will use specia lized technology that identifies transmission links between HCV infected research 
subjects. The GHOST platform is a secure cloud -based public health research tool to allow state and 
local health departments to act more quickly to detect and fight the sprea d of Hepatitis C. Specimens 
utilized for this laboratory -based initiative will be collected and shared in the context of two 
complementary protocols:  
1. A baseline, retrospective evaluation of HCV transmission clusters using remnant serum 
specimens currently stored at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene.  
2. An analysis of prospectively collected blood specimens obtained from individuals who undergo 
rapid testing for HIV, HCV and syphilis as part of their participation in this study.  
5.2.1. Retrospective analysis of HCV transmission clusters in Wisconsin.  
We have analyzed data reported to the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS) 
to identify cases of HCV infection that were reported for the first time between January 2016 and 
December 2017. Approximately 15% of all HCV cases reported to t he surveillance system during this 
time represented individuals who underwent fee -exempt confirmatory HCV RNA testing through 
WSLH; these instances typi[INVESTIGATOR_571247], and not traditional health care settings. This results in 
a sample that is enriched for younger people with a history of injection drug use. By [CONTACT_22242], birth 
cohort testing in WI has been conducted mostly in primary care settings, which utili ze commercial or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571248].  
We have identified [ADDRESS_750254] an HCV RNA+ sample analyzed at WSLH during [ADDRESS_750255] investigators perform genetic sequencing of 
 
24 
 the virus to understand transmission networks, data will be uploaded to a secured web interface in 
order for researchers and the Department of Health Services to access, according to procedures 
described below (5.2.2.)  
5.2.2. Prospective data collection and analysis of HCV transmission clusters in Wisconsin.  
Remnant blood specimens from the confirmatory testing procedures collected from prospectively 
enrolled study participants will also be used to support the GHOST -related research aims of the multi -
site collaborative research program. Upon receipt of a react ive rapid antibody detection test, Vivent 
Health staff will draw 5 mL of blood into each of up to 3 serum separator tubes (SST), depending on 
how many of the [ADDRESS_750256] tubes will be kept cold (4 -8°C) a nd shipped 
together with the appropriate requisition forms to WSLH via overnight delivery. Confirmatory testing 
will be performed on specimens on the day of receipt, and aliquots of residual serum will be 
transferred to secondary tubes and placed in a -80°C laboratory freezer for indefinite storage.  
Stored serum specimens for HIV, hepatitis C, and Syphilis positive participants will be shipped to 
GHOST laboratories for phylogenetic testing on a monthly basis. GHOST laboratories are housed at 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571249]. They will perfor m genetic sequencing of the virus to 
understand networks. The data will then be uploaded to a secured web interface in order for 
researchers and the Department of Health Services to access sequence data.   
Access to the sequencing data by [CONTACT_571330]’s system, known as SAMS. The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s (CDC) Secure Access Management Services (SAMS) is a federal  information 
technology (IT) system that gives authorized personnel secure access to non -public CDC 
applications. The SAMS partner portal is a website designed to provide centralized access to public 
health information and computer applications operated by  [CONTACT_6750]. For the National Healthcare 
Safety Network (NHSN) Program, SAMS will provide healthcare facilities and other partners, such as 
state health departments and QIOs, with secure and immediate access to the NHSN application.  
The UW -Madison -based PI [INVESTIGATOR_571250]. Data accessed through SAMS 
will be limited to the viral sequence data derived from the coded H CV RNA -positive samples sent to 
the GHOST laboratory. No direct identifiers will be associated with data that is accessible through 
SAMS. Additional information about SAMS is available at https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/sams/sams -user-
faq.html#a1 . 
5.3. Data collection for Aim 2.  
Guided by [CONTACT_571331] (see Section 1.4), we will assess (a) community -level 
vulnerability to consequences of injection drug use and (b) availability of essential prevention services 
through data collection at the county -level, health syst em and provider -level, and client -level. 
Interview guides for clients and local service providers will be developed collaboratively by [CONTACT_941] 
 
[ADDRESS_750257] -related resources within our 
designated counties. An assessment of service needs and gaps will be conducted. We will identify 
additional sources of county -level data to complement our preliminary compi[INVESTIGATOR_571251], including use of PDMP and State opi[INVESTIGATOR_571252]. Availability of these data sources are reflected in 
letters of support from WI DHS collaborators.  
Aim 2b/Aims 2c. Provider - and client -level data.  Semi -structured individual elicitation interviews 
will be administered to obtain insight from providers of services to injection drug users and clients of 
these agencies about the context of opi[INVESTIGATOR_571253].  
Aim 2b. Provider interviews  will be conducted in person or by [CONTACT_648], and are expected to last 30 -
45 minutes in duration.  They will be audio -recorded and transcribed for later analysis. The goals are 
to assess (1) services provided to opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155], (2) barriers and facilitators of a ccess to their services, 
(3) gaps in service, and (4) strategies to address these gaps. We also will assess the agency’s 
willingness to support a community -based, client -centered prevention home approach to reducing 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_571254] d infectious disease transmission risk among opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]. The provider interviews, 
along with the county -level resource mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], will inform the readiness and ability of the county to 
implement a comprehensive prevention program. Agencies will be purposiv ely recruited to represent 
multiple service domains, including HIV/HCV/STI testing and treatment, medical and mental health, 
substance misuse treatment, psychosocial assistance, health officials, and law enforcement. The 
specific provider sample size will depend on the number and variability in the county resources 
mapped out in Aim 2a.  
Aim 2b. Provider mail and email -based surveys.  A survey investigating willingness to screen and 
treat PWID for HCV and opi[INVESTIGATOR_571255]3 sites. 
The goals of this mail and email -based survey are to quantitatively asses (1) the willingness of rural 
primary care providers to provide treatment for HCV infection and/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_571256], (2) the prevalence and correlates of failure to provide appropriate screening for HIV, viral 
hepatitis, and sexually transmitted diseases for people who inject drugs, and (3) negative provider 
attitudes towards people who inject drugs that may serve as a barrier to effective primary care in rural 
communities. A cover letter, paper survey, and a $[ADDRESS_750258] not responded to 
the survey will be emailed wit h a web -link to the same survey.  
Aim 2c. Client interviews  will be conducted in -person in a private setting agreed upon in advance by 
[CONTACT_571332].  Interviews will be digitally audio recorded and transcribed for 
subsequent qualitative analysis. Respondents will be paid an incentive of $30 for each interview. 
Interview guides will explore: (1) Individual characteristics and circumstances . We will ask people 
to tell us about themselves, their life circumstances (e.g., housing, employment or school, 
transportation, financi al support), and their daily routine. We also will assess the impact of positive 
and negative life experiences on their injection drug use. The relationship of these factors to risk 
behavior will be explored. (2) Family and other interpersonal relationships.  We will ask 
participants to tell us about their family and other significant interpersonal relationships they have, 
including the nature of the relationship, things they do together, and things they talk about. We will 
explore substance use and sexual r isk behavior patterns within the participant’s extended family and 
among significant others. (3) Community contexts . We will explore participant’s perceptions of the 
 
26 
 neighborhood(s) in which they live and socialize, including the types of people that live there, their 
social interaction patterns, and the places that people go to hang out and use drugs. We also will 
explore the availability and usage of social services,  employment opportunities, and programs that 
promote community (e.g., churches). (4) State policy . We will ask about people’s experiences with 
the legal system, including both incarcerated and non -incarcerated jurisdiction. We will explore the 
impact that involvement with the legal system has on their injection drug use. (5) Sexual behavior . 
We will explore participant’s sexual behavior patterns, and the contexts or factors increasing or 
decreasing sexual risk likelihood. We also will assess participants’ HIV/STD/hepatitis risk perceptions 
and concerns. Risk reduction behavioral and negotiat ion strategies will be explored. (6) Substance 
use behavior . We will explore participants’ substance use patterns with a focus on injection drug 
use, and the contexts or factors increasing or decreasing use likelihood. We will assess (un)safe 
injection practices. We also will assess the saliency and centrality of substance use in participant’s 
lives and the lives of their family and significant others.  
A limited dataset of transcripts will be sent to the University of Washington DCC as part of the data 
harmonization project after the School of Medicine and Public Health’s honest broker has reviewed 
them to assess PHI.  
 
5.4 Data Collection for Aim 3 (Phase 2 - UH3)  
 
Prevention Navigation.  The health -related goals for PWID in the context of this study are multi -
faceted, reflecting the heterogeneous needs of this vulnerable population. Accordingly, there is not a 
single, primary outcome which can be measured to evaluate the impact or effecti veness of the 
intervention. We therefore have proposed a study design that allows us to evaluate the influence of 
prevention navigation on progress toward a number of health goals. Because no single study design 
can account for all of the biases inherent i n a non -randomized, multi -county intervention trial, we have 
proposed 2 different types of comparisons in our evaluation strategy (Appendix 1). Prevention 
Navigators will collect case notes and worksheets as part of the intervention, but this will only be 
accessible to them. These documents will be analyzed as data or shared with the UW -Madison 
research team.  
The preferred method for intervention sessions is one -on-one in person, with optional one -on-one 
phone or video interventions when needed  (ex: COVID -19 Pandemic) . Staff will only contact [CONTACT_571333], getting permission to leave messages before doing 
so. All virtual interventions and follow up calls will be performed on the navigators’ cell phones or 
laptops provided by [CONTACT_571334]. Staff may also text participants  to remind them of appointments, 
request a follow up  call, or other short communication purposes. No messages will be sent without 
consent from the participant while filling out the locator form.  Per Vivent Health policy, staff are 
permitted to communicate with clients about their care and treatment via Facebook  messenger  
utilizing a professional Facebook account that is separate from any personal accounts. Staff are not 
permitted to use personal accounts to communicate with clients in a professional capacity. No data 
will be collected over social media acco unts. Facebook conversations will not count as an intervention 
session.  
Survey and needs assessment.  The primary source of data collection in all three groups of the 
study will be from the ACASI questionnaire, administered at 0 months (baseline), [ADDRESS_750259] of multiple choice questions designed to efficiently assess drug 
use history, access and utilization of prevention services, readiness for intervention, and injection 
related risk behaviors.  The final survey a participant takes will include exit questions to help us 
evaluate and improve the program. Participants enrolled in the intervention between February 1, 2023 
and March 31, 2023 will complete the baseline and 3 months ACASI questionnaire only.  
 
ACHESS.  All participants will complete study assessments using the ACHESS application. ACHESS 
can be accessed by [CONTACT_571335] a smartphone or via a web browser. Participants 
may also take part in optional non -research activities within the ACHESS  app. These activities 
include: 1) posting on discussion boards, 2) utilizing the private message function to communicate 
with study staff or other participants, 3) viewing local community resources and their contact 
[CONTACT_3031], 4) viewing and saving motivational quotes of the day and logging thoughts of gratitude, 
and 5) accessing study staff contact  [CONTACT_3031].  
Rapid testing for infectious diseases.  Upon enrollment, participants will provide 2 finger stick 
whole blood samples for rapid testing of HIV and HCV at baseline , 3-months,  and 6-month follow up . 
Participants enrolled in the intervention between February 1, 2023 and March 31, 2023 will complete 
the baseline and 3 -month rapid testing only. Vivent Health prevention staff are trained to perform 
point -of-care tests for these infections using the Alere Determine ™ HIV-1/2 Ag/AB Combo (Alere Inc., 
Waltham, MA)  and the OraQuick® HCV Rapid Antibody Test (OraSure Technologies, Bethlehem, PA. 
During the [ADDRESS_750260] results, participants may complete the ACASI questionnaire 
(described above).  If testing by [CONTACT_85842], participants should complete the survey before arriving 
to their appointment.  If both rapid tests are non -reactive, then the study visit will end for non -
intervention clients and an appointment will be made for their 3 -month visit. Among intervention 
clients, the study visit will end and  an appointment will be made for intervention visit  or phone/video 
call. If either  of the [ADDRESS_750261] a 
blood specimen to be sent to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH) for confirmatory 
testing, and arrange a follow -up visit to review confirmatory test results and p rovide linkage to care, if 
needed. In the event that a participant cannot provide a blood specimen for confirmatory testing due 
to poor venous access, they will be i nvited to return at a later date for another blood draw attempt. 
Those confirmed to have active HIV  or HCV infection will be linked to a local provider with the 
assistance of a Vivent Health case manager or Prevention Navigator.  
The test results and risk data collected on the HCV  and HIV test forms will be entered into Vivent 
Health’s standard of practice database, ServicePoint. Study ID numbers will be included to identify 
the results as study participants. ServicePoint will securely send data to WEDSS regularly. Only 
those on the  HCV team at WI DHS, which consists of three research team members, will have access 
to the data. Test forms will be securely faxed to UW -Madison and mailed to DHS, then securely 
locked at Vivent Health, UW-Madison, and DHS.  
Laboratory -based confirmatory testing and specimen handling . Specimens received by [CONTACT_571323] (see Facilities and Resources for 
details). After completing the required testing and reporting test results to the testing agency and the 
WI Surveillance System , WSLH staff will store plasma specimens in preparation for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_571243]/or GHOST laboratories, as described in Section 5.[ADDRESS_750262] shown that this is essential for 
ensuring study prot ocol fidelity, maintaining high -quality data collection, and maximizing client 
willingness to participate. We will take advantage of existing data collection forms that are used 
 
28 
 during HIV and HCV testing encounters to capture necessary individual -level data elements. All 
publicly -funded HIV testing sites in WI are required to use a uniform data collection and reporting 
system called Evaluation Web (Luther Consulting, LLC, Carmel,  IN). Rapid HCV testing supported by 
[CONTACT_571324] -level data using the Wisconsin Electronic Disease 
Surveillance System (WEDSS). With participant consent, the paper data collection forms used to 
capture the required demograph ic and risk behavior information will be transmitted to the UW -
Madison based study coordinator via secure fax -to-PDF system, and will be stored on an encrypted 
server in a directory separate from other study data.  
Medicaid and Health Care Utilization Analysis.  We will link multiple existing datasets at the 
individual -level to evaluate the effects of the intervention health care use. These include the WI 
Department of Corrections (DOC) administrative dataset, Medicaid enrollment and claims data, WI 
State Laborat ory of Hygiene (WSLH) HCV test records, WI Department of Health Services HCV 
Surveillance data, and the new county -level data resource developed through the activities under Aim 
2a. 
Based on our work with the JCOIN supplement, the UW -Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP) will 
assist in constructing the study dataset. The IRP has longstanding technical expertise in the 
construction and secure use of integrated person -level electronic  datasets that combine State of 
Wisconsin administrative data including Department of Corrections and Medicaid administrative and 
health care claims data. Specifically, the IRP maintains the Multi -Sample Person File (MSPF) dataset 
which combines data for t he universe of individuals interacting with several WI state agencies, 
including the Department of Health Services (home of the Medicaid program) and the Department of 
Corrections, at the person -level dating back to the late 1990’s through the present. The  MSPF is 
structured at the person -level, and each individual has a unique ID over time and across state 
agencies (e.g., a person who is incarcerated in a WI state prison and later enrolled in WI Medicaid) 
which supports longitudinal analysis.  
For Aim 3, we will provide the UW IRP programming staff with our sample selection criteria. They will 
query the MSPF dataset with these criteria to identify possible linkages to our study participants along 
with a comparison group to evaluate the intervent ion itself. In addition to basic program participation 
information (e.g., dates of participation), the MSPF includes identifying variables for each unique 
person including Social Security number, date of birth, name, and the individual’s identification 
number for each state agency that contributes to the MSPF in which s/he receives or has received 
services. The IRP will submit a finder file with the relevant identification information to each entity that 
is providing person -level data for the study. Upon re ceipt of these data, the IRP will then merge data 
from all sources at the person level, assign a unique, study number to each subject, and remove the 
personal identifying information used to match data across sources from the analytic dataset that is 
provi ded to the investigators.  
The exchange of data between the IRP and state agencies is governed by [CONTACT_571336] a strict data security protocol to protect the 
confidentiality of individuals. The DUA between the IRP an d the WI Medicaid program was modified 
and approved for this study in September 2018.  
COVID -19 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_473794] . All data  will be collected in REDCap, ServicePoint,  Vivent Health’s 
secure server,  or on a secure server only accessed by [CONTACT_571337]. Sessions will happen via 
phone or Microsoft teams, Vivent Health’s approved secure video call resource.  
Screening data  and locator forms will be stored on the  Vivent Health server or secure PHI box and 
entered into REDCap for analysis by [CONTACT_240171].  
COVID -[ADDRESS_750263] session of the intervention , as well as 30 days after Vivent returns to their full service model  
(if deemed appropriate post pandemic) . The assessment will ask a shortened version of ACASI 
survey questions specifically relevant to the pandemic. The rest of the assessment will follow the 
same risk and needs outline as designed for UH3, just with goals specific to the pandemic. Data will 
be stored on the Vivent Health secure server before being uploaded to a PHI box for analysis. All 
participant data  will be collected by [CONTACT_571338].  
At home testing data will be collected online using Vivent Health’s testing protocol. Testing forms will 
be filled out online, and collected by [CONTACT_571339]. Individual data will be uploaded to the PHI box , 
REDCap, or Vivent Heath server  by [CONTACT_571340].  
Data Matching  We will combine data for participants who completed both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of 
the study. Combining information across studies could potent ially increase the value of individual’s  
participation beyond what is learned in any individual study and increase knowledg e about  health 
problems that can result from injecting drugs and w ays to reduce the risk of HIV, h epatitis C, and 
overdose . 
6.0 MEASUREMENT CONSIDERATIONS  
Data analysis for Aim 1 .  
The research questions under Aim 1 are descriptive rather than hypothesis -driven. The data collected 
for this Aim will be used in the UG3 phase to describe burden of infectious consequences of injection  
drug use , and self -reported access to essential prevention services in the selected rural communities. 
The same data will be used to establish baseline values in the pre/post analyses for the UH3 phase, if 
selected to proceed, described below (see Section 3.5.4). We will evaluate baseline statistics for 
participants recruited from the catchment areas associated with each Vivent Health  prevention office, 
to determine if variation exi sts among rural regions of the state for each of the key variables of 
interest.  
Prevalence estimates and standard errors will be calculated using RDSAT version 7.1. RDS accounts 
for a source of bias that is especially severe when sampling hard -to-reach groups; namely, that well -
connected individuals tend to be over -sampled because man y recruitment paths lead to them. RDS 
draws statistically valid samples of previously unreachable groups by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_571257]. The recruitment process mathematical 
model weights the s ample to compensate for non -random recruitment patterns. Based on Markov 
chain theory and biased network theory, the analysis provides unbiased population estimates and 
measures of the precision of the estimates.  
 
Data analysis for Aim [ADDRESS_750264] drugs, we will use a time -to-event analysis approach (i.e., Kaplan Meier curves and 
survival analysis with Cox Proportional Hazards regression models) to quantify COVID -19 testing, 
infection, vaccination, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and mortality rates and predictors of these outcomes among 
participants of our prior study. This will involve excluding our prior study participants who were 
deceased prior to th e start of the US COVID -19 pandemic (March 1, 2020) and calculating person -
 
[ADDRESS_750265] drugs stratified 
by [CONTACT_551], sex, racial -ethnic group, and county. We will fit Poisson models (or negative binomial if 
needed due to overdispersion) with each COVID -19 outcome and the following covariates: age group, 
sex, racial -ethnic group, county, month/year, and an indicator representing whether the row of data 
corresponds to data form people who i nject drugs vs. general population. The coefficient for the 
indicator variable will be exponentiated to quantify an incidence rate ratio interpretable as the 
magnitude of disparity between people who inject drugs and the general Wisconsin population for 
each COVID -19 outcome, adjusted for age, sex, racial -ethnic group, county, and time.  We will 
additionally examine how age group, sex, and racial -ethnic group status modifies the magnitude of 
disparity by [CONTACT_571341]. We may also describe results by [CONTACT_571342]. Any rates or counts involving 
fewer than 5 individuals will be suppressed (i.e., the results will not be viewable on a map), consistent 
with confidentiality standards of DHS.  
 
Overdose outcomes. We will use a time -to-event analysis approach (i.e., Kaplan Meier curves and 
survival analysis with Cox Proportional Hazards regression models) to quantify fatal overdose rates 
(from vital records data) and nonfatal overdose rates (from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571258] a) and predictors of 
these outcomes among people who inject drugs. This will involve calculating person -time as the 
number of days from study participation date through the date of outcome data provided from DHS. 
We will examine sociodemographic and behavi oral risk and protective factors (covariate list provided 
in the appendix) by [CONTACT_571343]. We will also examine whether overdose rates changed 
pre- and post -COVID -19 by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a time covariate with an interaction term indicative of the per iod 
(before March 1, 2020 vs. on/after March 1, 2020). If there are a sufficient number of fatal and 
nonfatal overdose events per county of residence (>5 events), we will also create maps of overdose 
rates by [CONTACT_571344].  We may also describe results by [CONTACT_571342]. Any rates or counts 
involving fewer than 5 individuals will be suppressed (i.e., the results will not be viewable on a map), 
consistent with confidentiality standards of DHS.  
 
Hepatitis vaccination outcomes.  We will describe vaccination prevalence and use a time -to-event 
analysis approach (i.e., Kaplan Meier curves and survival analysis with Cox Proportional Hazards 
regression models) to quantify predictors of hepatitis A and B vaccination among people who inj ect 
drugs. We will calculate vaccination prevalence overall (defined as being vaccinated on or before 
 
31 
 participation in our prior study). If there are a sufficient number of individuals vaccinated per county of 
residence (>5 events), we will also create maps of vaccination prevalence by [CONTACT_571344]. For the time to 
event analysis seeking to understand predictors  of vaccination, we will exclude persons vaccinated 
prior to study enrollment from the predictor analysis to ensure temporality (i.e., that predictors 
measured during our prior study occurred before the outcome of vaccination). This will involve 
calculatin g person -time as the number of days from study participation date through the date of 
outcome data provided from DHS. We will examine sociodemographic and behavioral risk and 
protective factors (covariate list provided in the appendix) by [CONTACT_571345] d ratios.  We may also 
describe results by [CONTACT_571342]. Any rates or counts involving fewer than 5 individuals 
will be suppressed (i.e., the results will not be viewable on a map), consistent with confidentiality 
standards of DHS.  
 
Data analysis for Aim 2.  
Guided by [CONTACT_571346],62,[ADDRESS_750266] illustrative quotes. 
Transcripts then will be formally content coded. If suggested by [CONTACT_26739], thematic categories will be 
refined, merged, or subdivided, and/or new themes created. To ensu re coding reliability, summaries 
will be coded by [CONTACT_571347]. Decision 
trails will be noted and documented.  
Quantitative data collected and returned via mail  and email  by [CONTACT_571348]. This data will be used to describe 
provider -level barriers, such as unawareness of the burden of HIV, HCV and sexually transmitted 
infections, a related tendency to under -screen for these conditions, and possibly stigmatizing attitudes 
towards people who inject drugs that may contribute to under -utilization of primary care services by 
[CONTACT_571349]. Insight gained through these surveys may be used for the design of the UH3 
phase.  
Triangulation of data.  
Data from the cross -sectional survey and biological specimen testing (Aim 1) will inform disease 
prevalence and associated risk behaviors in our initial catchment counties. Data from the  quantitative 
mail and email -based primary care provider survey and  qualitative provider and client interviews 
(Aims 2b/2c) will provide contextual information about drug use, risk behavior, and service access 
and utilization. These data will be layered onto the compi[INVESTIGATOR_571259] -level data and resources 
(Aim 2a) and  a comprehensive summary report will be generated to guide evaluation of which 
counties are best suited for the implementation phase.  
Benchmarks for progressing to UH3 phase.   
If the research proposed above is successful, by [CONTACT_96138] [ADDRESS_750267] access to the complete package of 
prevention services. We believe that transition to the UH3 phase of the study, which is described 
below, will be justified if we achieve the following milestones: (1) Client reachability:  We will enroll 
no fewer than  [ADDRESS_750268] 2/3 of this number will demonstrate our ability to e ngage SSP clients in sufficient numbers to 
answer our research questions and guide implementation of the Client -Based Prevention Home 
model. (2) Local service capacity:  We will confirm there are sufficient resources in at least [ADDRESS_750269] with implementation of the service 
delivery model if we cannot identify providers who provide MAT or are willing to start provision of this 
service with support and consultation from the UW Addiction Medicine Program (see “Provider -level 
interventions” below). (3) Community stakeholder willingness: We will confirm that key 
stakeholders (e.g., MAT provider s, County Public Health Officers, Criminal Justice Agencies, others) 
are supportive of the new prevention services model participating counties. We will obtain letters of 
support if requested by [CONTACT_571350].  
Data Analysis for Aim 3.  
There is not a single, primary outcome which can be measured to fully evaluate the impact or 
effectiveness of the intervention. We therefore have proposed a study design that allows us to 
evaluate the influence of prevention navigation on progress toward a number of health goals.  
Appendix [ADDRESS_750270] of the 
client -centered prevention home model is based on the change in proportion of clients in the 3 target 
counties who receive the 9 essential services (see Table 1, pg. 2) compared to clients in the [ADDRESS_750271] for respondent -
driven sampling is likely to be 2 or less,64 which suggests that a sample twice that of simple random 
sampling should provide adequate power. We estimate that approximately 10% of all clients will have 
access to all [ADDRESS_750272] an increase in service provision of 8 -10% 
([ADDRESS_750273] a 10% difference in essential service provision rates; 
[ADDRESS_750274] an 8% difference), assuming 80% power and 5% type I 
error.  
Sample size and power considerations  for Aim 3 . The complexity of our study design requires 
multiple longitudinal approaches to account for independent and dependent samples. Based on our 
formative work, an average of 2 clients enrolled  per week  into the study is feasible for the SSP staff.  
 
33 
 With a sample size of 405 (270 intervention and 135 controls), we would have 80% power to detect a 
difference between 28% and 42% in the same outcome, an effect size that we believe is meaningful 
and realistic to achieve.  In other words, the sample size was chosen to ensure that the Primary Aim 1 
comparisons of “Strongly Agree” vs all others of a factor would have sufficient power to detect 
clinically meaningful increases in accessibility. To address Primary Aim 1, we used  preliminary data 
from the first ph ase of the study to assume that the base rate of a participant who will strongly agree 
that it is easy for them to access addiction treatment services is 26%.  
COVID -[ADDRESS_750275] and second 
assessments. Using the same process as above, comparisons of “Strongly Agree” vs all others 
of a factor would have sufficient power to detect meaningful increases in accessibility. We 
expect a total sample size of 216 PWID, which provides adequate statis tical power (0.83) to 
detect a 20% difference between three time points of interest (two -sided alpha=0.05).

9.[ADDRESS_750276] RISK  
 
A.  Characteristics of human participants  
Individuals in the cross -sectional and client interview (UG3)  phases will be eligible for enrollment 
if they are [ADDRESS_750277] 1 month, and reside in a rural 
community. Rural residence will be determined by [CONTACT_571302], which will be programmed in the 
screening instrument on REDCap. The eligibility form will classify a participant as a rural resident if 
the ZIP Code’s RUCA Approximation is greater than or equal to 4, or if they live in a catchment area 
of the SSP.  Providers  will be eligible if they are employed by [CONTACT_571351][INVESTIGATOR_45155]. All 
study participants must be capable of communicating in English.   
 
34 
 Individuals in Phase 2 (UH3)  will be eligible if they are [ADDRESS_750278] 1 month, and reside in a rural community.  
B.  Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
Minorities:  The study will include people of all races and ethnicities proportional to rural population of 
injection drug users accessing services.  
Women:  Women will be included in the study proportional to rural population of injection drug users 
accessing services.  
C.  Participation of Minors  
Phase 1 (UG3).  Minors ages 15 -17 will be eligible to participate if they meet other eligibility criteria.  
Under the applicable federal regulations (45 CFR § 46.402(a)) “children” are persons who have not 
attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures in volved in the research, under the 
applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted. Under Wisconsin statutes, 
minors age 15 -17 may consent for STI testing and treatment, HIV testing, and alcohol or drug abuse 
assessm ent, evaluation, or treatment (outpatient). Thus, minors ages 15 -17 are not “children” for 
purposes of the applicable regulations with respect to these tests.  Additionally, the IRB will be asked 
to determine if this research protocol is designed for a sub ject population for which parental or 
guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect participants and may waive the 
parent/guardian consent requirement.   Federal regulation requires an “appropriate mechanism for 
protecting the children who  will participate as subjects” as a substitute for parental consent. This will 
be accomplished by [CONTACT_571352]. The consent document will notify minor 
participants that such resources are available if needed, and all research staff will be prepared to link 
clients to a local agency belonging to the Child Advocacy Centers of Wisconsin 
(http://www.cacsofwi.org ).  
Phase 2 (UH3).  No minors will be participating in this phase of the study.  
D. Protection of Incarcerated Individuals  
For Aim 3, our program is a [ADDRESS_750279], they will simply 
fill out the survey and mail it back.  
The provider survey will be administered by [CONTACT_571353] (UWSC). UWSC will administer, 
track, enter, and code the survey data. Questionnaires handled by [CONTACT_571354].  Completed questionnaires ar e stored in locked file cabinets or 
locked storage rooms within their secure data entry facility for up to [ADDRESS_750280] attempt to increase ou r response rate will include 
an email explaining the study and a website hyperlink to fill out a survey. The web -based survey will 
be housed on the same platform of the ACASI survey.  
Client interviews.  People who participate in the cross -sectional study described above will be 
systematically invited (e.g., every nth person) to also participate in a qualitative interview. Interested 
participants will be contact[CONTACT_571355]. Clients will be asked 
to sign an additional consent prior to enrollment in this study activity.  
Phase 1 (UG3) Participants.  Vivent Health prevention staff will meet with the person in a private 
room to explain more about the study. If they are interested, they will be given a consent document to 
read, and a phone call will be placed by [CONTACT_571356] a study coordinato r at UW -Madison. 
The participant and the researcher will then speak by [CONTACT_118327] a private location to complete the 
eligibility screening and informed consent process. This will be done to minimize the impact of the 
research activ ities on the routine prevention activities of Vivent Health staff, and ensure that potential 
participants have enough time to have their questions answered prior to deciding whether or not to 
participate.  During the initial phone call, potential participa nts will be provided with a detailed 
explanation of the study and questions will be answered. People who are willing to participate will be 
given formal informed consent using an iPad. Participants undergo a comprehension quiz on the iPad 
that assesses the ir understanding of the consent documentation. If a person agrees to take part in the 
project, he/she will be asked to sign the consent and HIPAA forms, which after the conclusion of the 
phone call with UW -Madison research staff, will be handed to the Vive nt Health prevention team 
member to be filed in a locked file cabinet. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_571260]. A signed copy of the consent and HIPAA forms will 
provided to the participant upo n request. For participants ages 15 to 17, the consent form may be 
used to obtain consent of the minor, provided the study personnel determines that those minors can 
 
36 
 comprehend the consent form. The consent form will be modified for participants ages 15 -17 by 
[CONTACT_1583] a separate authorization section for the minor and the person obtaining assent.  
For the retrospective analysis of stored HCV+ serum specimens obtained from WSLH and shared 
with GHOST laboratory collaborators, a waiver of consent and authorization is requested.  
If participants are screened using a paper form at Vivent Health or at an outreach event, a paper copy 
of the consent document will be given to them and the Vivent Health staff will go over the study 
procedures. A study coordinator will be on standby [CONTACT_571357]. If the participant agrees to be part of the study, the participant will be asked to 
sign the paper copy of the consent form. The form will be kept in the participant's folder in a double 
locked cabinet. Vivent Health already has a process in place since they work with HIV testing and 
case management. During outreach events, Vivent Health staff will securely transport screening 
documents and rapid test forms  in a locked briefcase and store the forms in the participant's folders in 
a double locked cabinet. Once the participant has signed the paper copy of the consent form the iPad 
will begin at the ACASI survey, therefore the consent documentation will not be replicated.  
DHS Linkage Study on COVID -[ADDRESS_750281] of the COVID -19 pandemic on the UG3 cohort, we will be providing DHS with identifiable data 
on UG3 participants, including participant name, date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, previous 
address, previous phone number, date of participation in our study  to facilitate linkage with approved 
registries (vital records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System, 
Wisconsin Immunization Registry). We are unable to re -obtain consent from participants for this data 
linkage because of the transient nature of this population and their lack of co nsistent access to a 
phone  or other communication devices . It is not uncommon for the phone number that was used to 
initially recruit the participant to be inactive or out -of-date within days. It would be unfeasible to re -
obtain consent participants from this cohort more than two years after initial recruitment. Considering 
this, we seek a  Waiver of Consent and a partial waiver of authorization to link original cohort data with 
DHS data. We have also provided a justification as to how the original study’s C ertificate of 
Confidentiality is aligned with this linkage study. These justifications can be found within the Arrow 
application. Prior to sharing data or receiving data from DHS, we will obtain a signed  Data Use 
Agreement that outline s the terms of the data sharing.  A log of disclosures will be maintained in 
accordance with guidance from the HIPAA privacy officers consulted in the design of this study (Ryan 
Moze, Staci Lowe; using the template: https://compliance.wisc.edu/wp -
content/uploads/sites/102/2019/02/Accounting -for-Disclosures -Log-Research.pdf ).   
 
Phase 2 (UH3) Participants.  Vivent Health staff will meet with participants in a private location within 
the SSP office for all aspects of the study. All forms will be delivered in person, and staff will gauge 
comprehension throughout the enrollment and verbal consent process. Participants will be given a 
copy of the verbal  consent if they choose to participate. Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_571261] a locked cabinet, only accessible by [CONTACT_5051]. Protections for the ACASI survey and 
blood specimens will be protected in the same manner as phase 1. The screening questionnaire will 
be the first document with both a name [CONTACT_571385], and subsequent documents will only 
have one or the other, aside from testing documents. If necessary, all of the above activities may take 
place virtually, with electronic record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_571262].  
 
[ADDRESS_750282] to monitor duplicate screens and compare ineligible  participants to those who enrolled. A paper 
copy of the consent form will be mailed to the participant upon authorization to do so or  sent by [CONTACT_571358]/email if that is the client’s preferred method of contact.  
ACHESS.  Upon account setup, participants will be able to choose a unique username [CONTACT_571386]. This username [CONTACT_571387][INVESTIGATOR_571263], and listed on any discussion 
board posts . To protect participant's identity, it will be recommended that participants choose a 
username [CONTACT_571388], etc.  
 
All subjects will have the option to contact [CONTACT_571359] . This would 
prevent any incoming private messages, along with removing the participant’s username [CONTACT_571389][INVESTIGATOR_571264]. Study staff will be able to monitor 
private messages, and participants can report any inappropriate or unwanted messages to study 
staff. The study team also has the option to turn off the private messaging function to those  who send 
inappropriate or un wanted content to other participants  to prevent future unwanted content.  
 
F.  Sources of research data  
The source of research data is clients’ ( injection drug users) biological specimens and their self -
reported survey data (all clients); and the qualitative interview (for people who complete this activity). 
Provider participant data will be limited to their qualitative interview  and quantitative mail  and email -
based survey . For phase two we will also be collecting demographic information, program data from 
intervention sessions (upon completion of the study), testing data, and contact [CONTACT_571360].  
DHS Linkage Study on COVID -[ADDRESS_750283] Among UG3 Participants.  For this analysis, w e 
will obtain external data from Wisconsin DHS via linkage of identifiable data from UG3 participants 
will several DHS registries, as described in detail above.  
G.  Potential risks  
Potential psychological risks to participants in this study are: (1) negative consequences if 
confidentiality of information obtained in this study were violated; (2) embarrassment, discomfort, or 
distressed emotional reactions to the study assessment meas ures; (3) increased anxiety about 
personal safety and wellness resulting from the interview or survey; and (4) potential for minor 
bruising or irritation from a phlebotomy blood draw if confirmatory HIV test is required due to a 
 
[ADDRESS_750284] the confidentiality of 
participants’ data and their identity. All investigators have extensive experience in the safe collection, 
handling, and storage of sensitive and highly confidential data. All name -identified informati on (e.g., 
informed consent) will be kept in a locked file, separate from any data. Data -related materials will be 
identified by a unique Research Identification Number (RIN) and stored in a second locked file. All 
materials will be kept in a locked room, e nsuring two locking measures. Access to these two files will 
be limited to the research team. All data files will be securely transferred using encryption. Computer 
databases will be password protected and accessible only to the research team. No individual 
identities will be used in a ny reports or publications that may result from this research project. Data 
requested from researchers from organizations not formally collaborating on this research project will 
only be shared in aggregate form per NIH and fe deral data sharing regulations.   
Prevention Navigation materials will utilize study ID  only, and will not include a name  [CONTACT_96179], as to 
prohibit this link from being made again in another location  and to protect the individual’s identity 
should a breech occur. Navigation files will be double locked and stored separately from any forms 
containing the participant’s name  [CONTACT_39646] a physical copy . All virtual copi[INVESTIGATOR_91685] a secure Vivent 
Health server.  Because of the nature of the participant’s lives, navigation sessions may need to occur 
outside of the office in a public location. Only essential documents will be brought with the navigator 
in a locked binder with a secure code. Documents will be immedia tely returned to the office to be 
double locked and stored properly. Should a prevention navigator need to work from home (for 
example, due to COVID -19 restrictions) essential files with study IDs and not names may be brought 
home in a secured binder and l ocked in a secure location inside their home. Files may not be left in a 
vehicle or outside of a locked room or cabinet.  
We recognize that we are asking participants to provide sensitive information about private behavior 
and health. Our research team is experienced in the collection of this type of information, and we will 
implement multiple safeguards to protect participan ts’ confidentiality. All project protocols will be 
subject to review by [CONTACT_571361] -Madison. The UW -Madison 
IRB will approve research involving children only if the IRB finds that the research includes any 
required additional safeguards outlined in ethical principles and applicable federal regulations, state 
laws and institutional policies. An inter -institutional agreement will be signed between the University 
of Wisconsin -Madison and Tulane University for IRB oversi ght; and a data sharing agreement will be 
obtained for any information shared with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services AIDS/HIV 
 
39 
 Program, the Wisconsin Division of Care and Treatment Services, and any outside jurisdictions (e.g., 
GHOST lab) with which data will be shared. Vivent Health  staff will be included in the University of 
Wisconsin -Madison IRB protocol. A Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained as a condition of 
the NIH grant award.  All study participants will be fully informed of the project goals and procedures, 
and of their rights as research participants, including the right to not participate without penalty. 
Signed consent will be obtained prior to the collection of any data, or the conduct of any research 
activities.   
Pregnant women are a vulnerable population whose inclusion in this research is justified by [CONTACT_571362], and increased prevalence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_571265]. Although drug use in pregnant women does not require 
mandatory reporting under state law, study team members may cho ose to voluntarily report it.  The 
possibility of this and the risks if this were to be reported will be  clearly outlined in the consent form.  
Prevention navigators will also communicate with the participant the risk of medical providers 
reporting such drug use when initiating referrals for care.  
Per HIPAA, participants will be advised during the consent process of our intent to collect biological 
specimens to test for HIV, HCV, and other STIs. Positive tests will be reported to the health 
department per state and local regulations.  
Follow up contacts will be performed with participants in both the intervention and control groups. 
Vivent Health study staff will perform all follow up contact s with intervention participants. These follow 
ups include appointment reminders, appointment scheduling, checking in after an important 
appointment, booster sessions via phone, and discussing test results. These contacts will be made in 
accordance to the participants’ preferred contact [INVESTIGATOR_12183]. Contacts with the control group will all be 
performed by  [CONTACT_571363]. Calls will be made to remind them to schedule follow up 
visits. Control participants will be called no more than 3 times between ea ch research visit to 
eliminate disruption to their daily lives. All social media interactions will occur using a professional 
Facebook account separate from personal accounts. Facebook’s privacy policy will be given to the 
participant if they choose to con tact their PN via Facebook, and they will be reminded that it is not a 
secure form of communication. PNs will suggest alternative ways to privately discuss treatment and 
care in detail. All phone calls and text messages performed by [CONTACT_571364] a 
Vivent Health provided work phone, separate from staff’s personal information. These phones have 
secure codes and laptops have two -factor authentication. Phone calls and text messages sent by [CONTACT_571365] a study phone only accessed by [CONTACT_571366] a secure 
code. No names will be stored in the phone.  
DHS Linkage Study on COVID -[ADDRESS_750285] at DHS, pending 
subsequent IRB approval and the establishment of the aforementioned agreements. Once the linkage 
is completed, participant data will be destroyed and not kept on file by [CONTACT_470165]. Our study team will 
receive the link ed dataset containing only a unique research identification number (identifiers will be 
removed before DHS provides the linked dataset).  
 
Steps to reduce discomfort or anxiety resulting from study participation . Assessment measures 
involve sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_571266]. Some participants may feel awkward or 
embarrassed when discussing, hearing about, or being asked to provide information related to their 
safety and wellness. Staff are trained t o employ techniques that prevent, reduce, or minimize 
embarrassment, discomfort, or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_571267]. Staff will be trained 
to observe for any eviden ce that a participant may be overly anxious and to assess whether threat 
sensitization and vulnerability perceptions are realistic. Vivent Health  and research field staff will be 
required to have extensive research - or program -based experience with the conduct of HIV -related 
research. The project will be guided by a detailed procedural manual, and field staff will receive 
intensive training focused  on the specific project protocols and materials to ensure that they are being 
rigorously and consistently impl emented, including extensive role -play rehearsal of recruitment, 
enrollment, and consent procedures and assessment procedures and materials. Staff will be required 
to demonstrate competence with project protocols prior to implementation. Investigators and field staff 
have or will be required to complete the NIH required CITI web -based ethics training. Interviews will 
be supervised by [CONTACT_571367]. The field team will meet 
regularly to discuss implementation iss ues and areas warranting additional training. If research 
personnel change during the course of the study, new staff will be required to complete the training 
described above prior to conducting any research activities.  
HIV, HCV, and syphilis testing and counseling safeguards . All testing staff have completed the 
Wisconsin AIDS/HIV Program state HIV test counselor training to ensure that HIV pre - and post -test 
counseling is conducted in accordance with state guidelines. Testing staff will be further required to 
complete traini ng and demonstrate competence with the fingerstick collection of whole blood 
specimens (i.e., rapid HIV, HCV, and syphilis point -of-care testing methodology) and phlebotomy 
blood draws prior to study Implementation; and complete annual training in blood bo rne pathogen 
control (“universal precautions”) to ensure adherence to the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration Occupational Exposure to Blood borne Pathogen standards. Any new staff who are 
hired will be required to complete the training package d escribed above, and demonstrate 
competency with HIV, HCV, and syphilis testing and counseling. James Sosman, M.D., will provide 
on-going review of counseling and testing procedures, as well as the interpretation and provision of 
test results to study parti cipants. If any adverse physical harm results from the administration of the 
rapid HIV, HCV or syphilis tests, free medical follow -up will be provided to participants. Vivent Health  
is a CLIA -certified HIV test site funded, in part, by [CONTACT_571368]/HIV’s HIV testing 
program.  
 
41 
 Specimens will only be sent for confirmatory testing for those rapid tests that they are already positive 
for, therefore, no new health information will be generated by [CONTACT_571369].  
COVID -19 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] . All data collected from participants will be stored on a secure server, REDCap, 
Qualtrics, and/or Client Point. Participants will be assigned a unique study ID, which will be linked to 
their name [CONTACT_571390], housed on the Vivent Health server, PHI box, and REDCap . All 
other forms used for these participants will only have their study ID attached. Testing forms will follow 
Vivent Health’s virtual testing protocol.  
All calls for virtual navigation, and originally proposed UH3 navigation performed virtually, will be 
conducted through a cell phone provided by [CONTACT_571370], or on Vivent Health’s approved 
video conferencing platform, Microsoft teams. Staff may conduct reminders or follow ups via their 
work telephone. Facebook messenger  from a business profile , or mail if the client consents to that 
form of contact.  
All other privacy and protection safeguards liste d in above sections involving testing, staff training, 
and reducing anxiety related to the study will be followed as outlined above.  
I.  Data safety and monitoring plan  
See Appendix  1. 
J. Data Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  
For the second phase (UH3), a  DSMB will be convened for this study in collaboration with the 
University of Wisconsin Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (UW ICTR). The ICTR Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) meets the requirements for an independent Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee or a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The committee is comprised of experienced 
clinical researchers representing a diversity of backgrounds, skills and knowled ge. The DMC helps 
investigators ensure subject safety, research integrity, and com pliance with federal regulations and 
local policies. The DMC also makes recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_452540], modification, suspension, or termination. Prior to submission of the final protocol and 
IRB application to the UW Health Sciences Institutional Review Board, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_133526] a DMC 
consultation using the online application form. Once convened, the DMC will meet annually to review 
study procedures and provide a report to the PI, which will be then submitted to the U W IRB and the 
NIDA PO within a month after each meeting.  
K.  Costs and alternatives  
There are no costs to the participants for taking part in this research project. The participants have 
the alternative NOT to participate in this project or seek services independently from other agencies.  
L.  Incentives  
Aim 1 and 2. Participants will receive $2 0 remuneration for survey participation on the day of 
enrollment, and will r eceive a smaller incentive of $[ADDRESS_750286] and are unable to provide a blood sample 
for HCV confirmatory testing due to phlebotomy difficulties, a one -time incentive of $10 will be 
provided if they return at a later date and attempt a second blood  draw. Syringe program clients and 
local service providers who agree to participate in qualitative interviews will be paid an incentive of 
 
42 
 $30 each for one hour -long interview.  All primary care providers who are selected to participate in the 
quantitative mail -based survey will receive an incentive of $5 at the time the survey is mailed to them.  
Aim 3. Participants will receive $20 remuneration for survey participation and rapid testing on the day 
of enrollment,  and will receive an additional incentive of $20 for 3 -month,  and 6-month assessments.  
Participants may also receive a monthly incentive of $[ADDRESS_750287] and are unable to provide a 
blood sample for HCV confirmatory testing due to phlebotomy difficulties, a one -time incentive of $10 
will be provided if they return at a later date and attempt a second bloo d draw. Additionally, 
participants will rec eive $10 for each eligible peer recruit who enrolls in the study.  
COVID -19 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] . Participants will receive $10 for each research assessment (baseline, [ADDRESS_750288] service resumption) . There will be no incentives for testing during this sub -phase of the 
study.  
L.  Potential benefits in relation to risk of the proposed research to the participants and others  
There are no direct intended personal benefits from participation in the UG3 phase  of this study. 
Although participants may not individually benefit from the study, the information obtained will guide 
the development of a comprehensive program aimed at protecting the health of PWID. In the UH3 
phase  of the study who receive the Client -Centered Prevention Home intervention are expected to 
achieve more positive health outcomes and better linkages to services and care than people who do 
not receive this interv ention.

 APPENDIX 1:  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
PI [CONTACT_5627]:  Westergaard, Seal (MPI)  
Grant Number: UH3DA044826  
Grant Title:  Community -based client -centered prevention homes to address the rural opi[INVESTIGATOR_571272]:  University of Wisconsin - Madison  
  
1.0. Project Overview  
 
1.1. PI [INVESTIGATOR_571273]. As contact [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_65517], [CONTACT_571391] accepts responsibility for implementation of the data and safety monitoring plan, and acknowledges the 
requirement to request and receive permission from the PO for protocol or DSMP changes in advance of their 
implementation.  
 
1.2. Brief protocol description.  In response to RFA -DA-17-014, HIV, HCV and Related Comorbidities in Rural 
Communities Affected by [CONTACT_46242][INVESTIGATOR_571207]: Building Systems for Prevention, 
Treatment and Control (UG3/UH3), our research team proposed a multi -phase, mixed -methods study that aims to 
implement and evaluate a novel community response model, which we have named the Community -Based, Client -
Centered Prevention Home , or Prevention Navigation .  
 
Using the organizational infrastructure of Vivent Health , a geographically dispersed population of people who inject drugs 
in rural communities across Northern Wisconsin, we are building locally responsive systems to facilitate uptake of 
evidence -based prevention services for high -risk clients. The Client -Cente red Prevention Home (CCPH) model 
incorporates prevention case management (called Prevention Navigators) into traditional harm -reduction services 
delivered at syringe service programs, which we hypothe size will increase use of treatment and prevention services. 
During the first [ADDRESS_750306] (UG3 phase), we performed needs assessments in six rural Wisconsin counties in 
partnership with local stakeholders, and conducted a survey among people who inject drugs. In the next three years of the 
project we will deploy and evaluate the CCP H model.  The growing problem of opi[INVESTIGATOR_571274], 
HCV, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_571275] -based prevention 
interventions.  
 
1.3. Study aims and study outcomes. The aims of the intervention is to evaluate the impact of the Client -Centered 
Prevention Home model, deployed within syringe service programs in counties with high burden of opi[INVESTIGATOR_571276], on the 
proportion of clients who receive the package of essential preventative services to prevent HIV/HCV in PWID.  
The goal of the Client -Centered Prevention Home program is to increase the knowledge of people who inject drugs on 
navigating prevention and treatment services for HIV, HCV, and drug overdose. We describe measures for our study 
population in the Appendix. Key sources for measurement will come from the ACASI survey that will be adapted from the 
ROI Harmonized UG3 survey, surveillance data gathered from the state of Wisconsin, and Medicaid health utilization 
data.  
 
1.4. Study data collection sites. The main community partner, Vivent Health , will serve as the data collection and study 
site. Vivent Health  is a statewide organization that provides harm reduction services, including syringe services and 
confidential HIV and HCV testing. As shown in Figure 1, three sites will be used for the intervention of the study: Brown 
County (Green Bay), Marathon County  (Wausau), and La Crosse County (City of La Crosse). The 3 other Vivent Health  
offices that participated in the UG3 study phase, including Outagamie County (Appleton), Eau Claire County (City of Eau 
Claire), and Douglas County (Superior), will serve as recruitment sites for control group participants during the UH3 
phase, but will not provide the prevention navigation i ntervention.  
 
1.5. Study sample description and inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Leveraging relationships developed among 
Vivent Health  clients and community partners during the UG3 phase, we will recruit participants using Vivent Health  staff 
at all six counties.  In order to be part of the study, participants must meet the following eligibility criteria: 1) clients must be 
at least 1 8 years old, 2) have injected drugs to get high in the past 30 days, and 3) reside in one of the participating 
communities in or around on e of the six participating counties.  
 
Exclusion criteria are: (1) not speaking English fluently, (2) residing outside or being unwilling or unable to travel for st udy 
visits at one of the participating communities.  
 
 
48 
 1.6. Sample size.  A total of 405 participants will be enrolled to evaluate the intervention (Figure 1). Study procedures will 
vary for participants based on enrollment into 2 study groups, as follows:  
 
(a) 270 participants enrolled at intervention sites, who will receive prevention navigation.  
 
 
(b) [ADDRESS_750307] proposed 2 different types of 
comparisons in our evaluation strategy :  
 
(A)  A within -person comparison using a pre/post study design  
Participants among intervention sites will serve as within -person comparisons as they will participate in baseline 
assessments , including self-reported outcomes evaluated using ACASI questionnaire , and then again in 3 and 6  
months  This is ideally suited for short -term outcomes that we hypothesize will be immediately influenced by 
[CONTACT_571373], such as perceived accessibility of services, and readiness/motivation to initiate addiction 
treatment. These self -reported outcomes are listed in Appendix  2.  
 
(B)  A comparison of participants enrolled at sites with and without prevention navigation  
In separate analyses, we will compare the self -reported outcomes of individuals enrolled at Vivent Health offices 
offering only standard prevention services without prevention navigation. This is advantageous for detecting changes 
over 6 months of follow -up. 
 
(C)  A cohort -study design comparing longer term outcomes using external data sources  
To detect changes in so -called “hard” outcomes such as enrollment in insurance, HCV cure, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 
initiation of medication assisted treatment, we will access sources such as the Wisconsin Medicaid data for all 
enrolled participants for up to [ADDRESS_750308]. Additional consent documents will be signed for rapid HIV  and HCV  testing as per procedures from the 
Wisconsin Department of Health Services.  
 
1.9 Collection of data for research/evaluation, In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Client -Centered Prevention 
Home, data will be collected data using various tools throughout the UH3 phase. Interested participants will first be 
screened for the study by [CONTACT_571374], respectively. Once screened 
eligible, participants will be tested for HIV, HCV, and syphilis at baseline , 3-month,  and 6 -month follow up. Testing forms 
 
49 
 provided by [CONTACT_571375]. At baseline, 3 -month, and 6 -month follow up, participants will complete an audio computer -
assisted self -interview (ACASI) survey that will assess substance use, injection behavior, past overdoses, addiction 
treatment, stigma, infectious diseases, access to health care, sexual risk behavior, mental health, criminal justice, and 
basic demographics.  
 
1.10. Collection of data for intervention implementation. The RE -AIM framework will be used to measure adoption 
and implementation of the intervention. In order to assess whether Prevention Navigators’ fidelity to the various elements 
of the intervention’s protocol are met, we will use program data to measure con sistency of delivery as intended for the 
intervention. After the participant has screened eligible and have provided informed consent, participants will engage with 
the Prevention Navigator at their  first intake. During that time, participants will be asked to sign an agreement of services, 
fill out a locator form, release of information form, and service request form. At the second session, participants will come  
back to assess their risk for infect ious diseases and overdose, and will develop a service plan using a problem solving 
worksheet and goals sheet. The problem solving and goals sheet will be amended at each session to assess progress to 
goals. Once the participant is ready to be discharged f rom the program, Prevention Navigators will fill out a discharge form 
that will consist of a checklist to make sure that there is plan in place for each goal that was set. Communications logs wil l 
document every successful and unsuccessful attempt in conta cting participants and will be used to measure fidelity of the 
protocol.   
 
1.11. Projected timetable. During the three year study period, the first quarter will be used for protocol development, 
hiring, and training of staff. Open enrollment for recruitment will begin during the second quarter and will continue through  
the second year. Enrollment for the s tudy will end during the summer of the second year in order to have a full [ADDRESS_750309] year will be used to close out the intervention, analyze the data, and 
disseminate our findings. The tim etable is presented in Table 1.

2.0. Data Security  
 
2.1. Data collection. The source of research data is clients’ biological specimens and their self -reported survey data  
along with all intervention materials used.  For all research components, data will be gathered  remotely on personal 
devices or  in private spaces where white noise machines will be placed outside the door to reduce the risk that others will 
overhear data collection activities. Self -administered surveys will be conducted using ACHESS  and will be  administered 
via the ACHESS app on a smartpho ne or web browser , or using wifi -enabled iPads with headphones. Data from the self -
administered survey are automatically stored in a password protected, HIPAA -compliant server that is accessible to UW -
Madison research staff. Information from rapid tests for HIV  and hepatitis will be securely faxed to UW -Madison and 
entered into a secured HIPAA -compliant database.  
 
Each participant will receive a unique identifying number that will be used in all materials related to the study. A master list 
matching identifiers to participants will be maintained on a database that is only accessible to research staff. All staff wi ll 
be trained in HIPAA compliance and best practices for human subjects research data  in order to ensure that they will not 
disclose information about participants to others outside of the study team.  
 
2.2. Data management and storage. The Project  Manager and shall be responsible for ensuring that the data for the 
project are securely stored, that storage is in compliance with University and federal regulations and that no unauthorized 
persons have access (electronic or physical) to any participant -identifiable data. All HIPAA regulations and guidelines will 
be followed, and all study staff must complete approved human subjects and HIPAA training programs.  Table [ADDRESS_750310] Timetable   
 
50 
 Inter-site data transfers are accomplished via secure file transfer protocols (SFTP) using an internet server maintained by 
[CONTACT_528172] (UWSMPH) Department of Medicine. To protect the privacy of database 
records and the inte grity of the network, this server is firewall -protected and is stored in a locked server room with a 
numeric keypad to restrict entry. The server is continuously scanned for the presence of viruses. A complete virus scan of 
all workstations also takes plac e once a week. Server system log files are scanned for unusual activity, which is 
immediately investigated. Network and Server Administration staff members apply critical and non -critical patches as 
needed. In addition, the study staff also have multiple m echanisms for preserving confidentiality of research participants 
and providing data security in the transfer of data from participant machines to the SFTP server. The Department of 
Medicine web servers use Secure Socket Layer (SSL or https) technology to encrypt data exchanged between the client 
and the server. In addition, all online and offline components of the data systems described in the proposal will be 
accessible only through a login and password unique to each user. The security access levels for these login accounts 
are tiered and the features and privileges given to each staff member will be determined by [CONTACT_571376]. To 
further protect confidentiality, only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_571277] r. Finally, 
the Department of Medicine employs extensive data backup and server redundancy procedures and performs full 
backups to tape weekly of all servers, along with incremental and daily backups.  
 
2.3. Data entry methods. The PIs will develop and implement protocols for assuring data collection accuracy and 
protocol compliance. Data will be entered through REDCap. Data entry staff will be automatically logged out after a 
specified time of inactivity. Consent forms and rapid  testing forms will be securely faxed using a HIPAA compliant, 
confidential fax line located at the University of Wisconsin -Madison.  
 
2.4. Quality assurance plan. Investigators and staff will have weekly team meetings to update study progress, discuss 
and problem -solve barriers to successful field implementation, and receive group training on cross -cutting QA issues. 
Staff also will receive individual training as ne eded.  
To monitor assessment quality assurance, staff will record process notes on a standardized form, including 
documentation of any questions or problems raised by [CONTACT_571377].  
 
3.0. Participant Safety and Monitoring  
 
3.1. Potential risks and benefits to study participants.  
 
Potential psychological risks to participants in this study are: (1) negative consequences if confidentiality of information 
obtained in this study were violated; (2) embarrassment, discomfort, or distressed emotional reactions to the study 
assessment meas ures; (3) increased anxiety about personal safety and wellness resulting from the intervention or survey; 
and (4) potential for minor bruising or irritation from a phlebotomy blood draw if confirmatory HIV test is required due to a  
reactive rapid test. Emo tional distress is common after a person learns he or she is HIV or HCV -positive.  
 
Confidentiality protections.  A number of steps will be taken to protect the confidentiality of participants’ data and their 
identity. All investigators have extensive experience in the safe collection, handling, and storage of sensitive and highly 
confidential data. All name -identifi ed information (e.g., informed consent) will be kept in a locked file, separate from any 
data. Data -related materials will be identified by a unique Research Identification Number (RIN) and stored in a second 
locked file. Access  to these two files will be limited to the research team. All data files will be securely transferred using 
encryption. Computer databases will be password protected and accessible only to the research team. No individual 
identities will be used in any rep orts or publications that may result from this research project. Data requested from 
researchers from organizations not formally collaborating on this research project will only be shared in aggregate form 
per NIH and federal data sharing regulations.  
 
We recognize that we are asking participants to provide sensitive information about private behavior and health. Our 
research team is experienced in the collection of this type of information, and we will implement multiple safeguards to 
protect participan ts’ confidentiality. All project protocols will be subject to review by [CONTACT_571378] -Madison. The UW -Madison IRB will approve research involving children only if the IRB finds that the research 
includes any required additional safeguards outlined in ethical principles and applicable federal regulations, state laws and 
institutional policies. An inter -institutional agreement that was used during the first phase of the study between the 
University of Wisconsin -Madison a nd Tulane University for IRB oversight; and a data sharing agreement for any 
information shared with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services AIDS/HIV Program, the Wisconsin Division of Care 
and Treatment Services,  Vivent Health,  and the GHOST lab will be used. CCHP staff will be included in the University of 
Wisconsin -Madison IRB protocol. A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained as a condition of the NIH grant award. All 
study participants will be fully informed of the project goals and proced ures, and of their rights as research participants, 
including the right to not participate without penalty. Consent will be obtained prior to the collection of any data, or the 
 
[ADDRESS_750311] completed the Wisconsin AIDS/HIV Program 
state HIV test counselor training to ensure that HIV pre - and post -test counseling is conducted in accordance with state 
guidelines. Vivent Health is a CLIA -certified HIV test site funded, in part, by [CONTACT_571368]/HIV’s HIV 
testing program.  
Specimens will only be sent for confirmatory testing for those rapid tests that they are already positive for, therefore, no 
new health information will be generated by [CONTACT_571369].  
 
In the UH3 phase of the study, participants who receive the Client -Centered Prevention Home intervention are expected 
to achieve more positive health outcomes and better linkages to services and care than people who do not receive this 
intervention.  
 
3.2. Potential adverse events (AEs) and Serious adverse events (SAEs). Unanticipated problems will be reported to 
the IRB in accordance with posted guidance. SAEs also may constitute unanticipated problems, depending on the nature 
of the event. In general, SAEs do not require reporting to the IRB unless they also potentially meet the definition of an 
unanticipated problem.  
 
An unanticipated problem is an event that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Reasonably related to the research;  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the research procedures that are described in the 
study -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document, and the 
characteristics of the participant po pulation being studied; AND  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized  
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during data collection may include:  
• Violation of confidentiality,  
• Discomfort due to assessment procedures,  
• Embarrassment in disclosing sensitive personal information,  
• Disclosure of information about current and/or intended physical harm persons,  
• Current and/or intended abuse of children (that would be reported to child welfare agency)  
• Dissatisfaction with the assessment procedures or intervention activities.  
The population of focus in this research is at high risk for multiple health consequences that are associated with 
 
[ADDRESS_750312] the study in case of an unanticipated serious adverse event (SAE).  
Potential adverse events will be reviewed as to the assigned treatment group and further classified by [CONTACT_926] (life -
threatening, serious, non -serious) and expected vs. unexpected. Expected and unexpected adverse events will be 
monitored at each enrolling  site and reported to overseeing agencies as required by [CONTACT_571379].  
 
3.6. Staff training. Staff will be required to demonstrate competence with project protocols prior to implementation. 
Investigators and field staff have or will be required to complete the NIH required CITI web -based ethics training. 
Interviews will be supervised by [CONTACT_571380] p roject investigators to ensure protocol adherence. Testing staff will be further 
required to complete training and demonstrate competence with the fingerstick collection of whole blood specimens (i.e., 
rapid HIV, HCV, and syphilis poin t-of-care testing methodology) and phlebotomy blood draws prior to study 
Implementation; and complete annual training in blood borne pathogen control (“universal precautions”) to ensure 
adherence to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Occupat ional Exposure to Blood borne Pathogen 
standards. Any new staff who are hired will be required to complete the training package described above, and 
demonstrate competency with HIV, HCV, and syphilis testing and counseling. Adverse event assessment, record ing, 
reporting, and investigation will be accomplished through staff training, structured/standardized assessments of untoward 
occurrences/events, and regular monitoring by [CONTACT_3476].  
 
4.0 Reporting Procedures to NIDA  
 
4.1. Procedures and timeline for reporting AEs and SAEs to NIDA. Reportable adverse events will be 
submitted to NIDA annually as part of the annual progress report. This report will describe the event, when it 
occurred, whether the participant was part of the control of intervention arm, and the outcome/resolution.  If 
there were no AEs that year, a statement that no AEs occurred will be included in the progress report or 
communicated to NIDA in writing.  
 
In this research, all deaths and unanticipated SAEs determined by [CONTACT_571381] n 
will be reported to the IRB and NIDA within [ADDRESS_750313].  A DSMB will be convened for this study in collaboration with the University of 
Wisconsin Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (UW ICTR). The ICTR Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
meets the requirements for an independent Data and Safety Monito ring Committee or a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board. The DMC is available for UW -Madison investigators when a funding agency, the PI, or IRB requires such a 
committee or board. The committee is comprised of experienced  clinical researchers representing a diversity of 
backgrounds, skills and knowledge. The DMC helps investigators ensure subject safety, research integrity, and 
compliance with federal regulations and local policies. The DMC also makes recommendations to th e PI [INVESTIGATOR_232545], modification, suspension, or termination. Prior to submission of the final protocol and IRB 
application to the UW Health Sciences Institutional Review Board, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_571278] a DMC consultation using the onl ine 
application form. After an initial consultation with the DMC, there are no conflicts of interest with the current committee. 
None of the current board members has no financial and/or scientific ties to the outcome of the study. A list of current 
voting  members are provided in the Appendix. The DMC will alert the investigation team if there is change in membership. 
If a conflict of interest arises, the PIs will inform NIDA within 24 hours of becoming aware of it. That member will abstain 
from voting or p roviding input to the study. As the protocol is refined and/or if a serious adverse event occurs, the DMC 
will work with the PIs and research team to determine whether or not there is a need to meet more than annually. After 
 
53 
 each meeting, the DMC will review emerging data, make recommendations about the trial’s conduct, including possibly 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  At the close of each meeting, the DMC will make one of four recommendations: continue as is, continue 
but with specific  modifications; stop temporarily until specific conditions are met; or terminate. The PIs will report DMC 
activity as part of their annual project progress report to NIDA.   
 
A report on DMC meetings and activities will be sent to NIDA within 30 days of the meeting. The update will include the 
following: meeting dates (past and upcoming if known), meeting minutes or summary, current board membership, 
changes in membership (if a pplicable), information about any new member(s) (if applicable) including statement that new 
members have no conflict of interest, and specific board recommendations regarding the research project (if any).

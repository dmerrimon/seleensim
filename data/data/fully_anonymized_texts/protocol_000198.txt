Protocol  
We will recruit 130 participants who are undergoing PRP injections for clinical treatment of 
symptomatic early knee OA into this comprehensive multidisciplinary, prospective, clinical study. 
Patients who meet the eligibility criteria described below and wh o provide informed consent will 
be enrolled. Human subjects will undergo research assessments at baseline, and at 3 clinically 
relevant time points of 1 month (4 weeks), [ADDRESS_910875] -
treatment assessment time points.  
 
 
 
Baseline: Subjects will be recruited from patients already indicated for and receiving PRP 
treatment as part of clinical care in the PI’s new PRP injection clinic at the VA Palo Alto, or in 
the practices of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_674032]. At the baseline test (t 0), human subjects enrolled in the study will 
complete self -administered pain/function questionnaires, perform a gait test to determine 
walking mechanics across the knee prior to P RP injection, and undergo a baseline MRI scan 
inclusive of T2 map sequences. In addition, medication usage will be recorded.  
 
PRP injection: Subjects will receive a series of three injections of autologous PRP, each 
approximately one week apart. Twice as much blood as needed for the clinical injection will be 
drawn and the resulting excess PRP from the actual PRP prepared for cli nical treatment and 
injected into the knee will be saved and taken to the laboratory for analysis. Participants will 
complete the 3 -injection course within a one -month time period.  
 
1-month (4 weeks) and 3 -months follow -ups: At the 1 -month (t 1) and 3 -month (t 2) post -injection 
visit, gait analysis will be performed and patients will complete self -administered pain/function 
questionnaires  
 
6-months follow -up: At the 6 -month (t 3) post -injection visit, gait analysis will be performed and 
patients will complete self -administered pain/function questionnaires. Patients will also undergo 
an MRI scan inclusive of T2 map sequences.  
 
This project will recruit males and females undergoing PRP injection for treatment of 
symptomatic early tibiofemoral knee OA. Inclusion Criteria: (1) ages 30 -70 years, (2) 
symptomatic early knee OA defined as having knee pain as well as (Kellgren -Lawrence (KL) 
radiographic grade 1 -2 (osteophytes and/or <50% joint space narrowing), or KL grade 0 (normal 
radiographs) with MRI and/or arthroscopic evidence of cartilage degeneration or loss, (3) full 
weight -bearing status, and (4) have elected to receive PRP tre atment. Exclusion Criteria: (1) 

inflammatory arthritis, gout or recurrent pseudogout (2) symptomatic OA of other lower extremity 
joints, (3) BMI >35 kg/m 2, (4) use of walking, orthopedic, or prosthetic assistive device, (5) 
severe systemic disease defined as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 3 or above 56, 
(6) inability to have MRI, (7) pregnant or intending to become pregnant during the study, (8) 
predominantly patellofemoral disease.

PURPOSE OF RESEARCH   
 
You are invited to participate in a research study about the effect of platelet enriched 
plasma (P RP).  We hope to learn the clinical effect of platelet enriched plasma (PRP) 
treatment in knee osteoarthritis (OA).   You were selected as a possible subject in this 
study because you have  medial compartment knee OA.  
 
This study is being done together by [CONTACT_674036].  
This research study is looking for [ADDRESS_910877] up to 60 months, with active  in-person  testing (in 
laboratory) of approximately [ADDRESS_910878]. Chu, or a designated representative of her research 
staff, will describe the study procedures to you.  
Screening Procedures : 
[CONTACT_674047] and her research study staff will tell you about the study and give 
you a copy of the consent form. After you have read the consent form and have all your 
questions answered, both you and the research staff will sign and date the document . 
You will be given a copy. We will ask questions regarding your health and all the 
eligibility records, including pertinent past medical records, will be reviewed. In order to 
help us determine the amount of arthritis you have, there may be up to four x -ray view 
taken of your legs. We will not allow anyone who is pregnant participate in this trial 
because it may have an effect on the fetus, and we may do a pregnancy test.  
 
Experimental Procedures:  
At a baseline test, we will ask you to complete questionnaires, have a motion analysis 
test, blood draw (up to 3 tablespoon), and have an MRI scan.  
 
[CONTACT_316145] and her research study staff will have you answer survey questions about your 
knee, your pain, your activities, and your overall quality of life. It should take about [ADDRESS_910879] University.  
 
At the time of your clinical treatment(s), we will save a sample of the joint injection for 
this research.  
 
We will be also be obtaining about 4 tablespoons  of blood for this research study  at 
each of your clinical injections .  You will be asked to donate additional tube(s) of blood 
specifically for this research study.  If you are scheduled to have a blood draw, this will 
be done at the same time to avoid the use of an additional needle stick.  
 
If synovial fluid will be removed as part of your clinical care, we would like to save a 
sample of the fluid (which is normally discarded) for this research.  
Following your clinical treatment, we will ask you to return for follow -up visits at 1, 3, and 
6 months after the end of your treatment(s). At [ADDRESS_910880] a second MRI scan.  We may also ask you to complete up 10 
questionnaires in the course of the study.  
 
MRI (M agnetic Resonance Imaging)  
 
MRI machines use a strong magnet and radiofrequency magnetic fields to make images 
of the body interior.  The scanning procedure is very much like an X -ray or CT scan.  You 
will be asked t o lie on a long narrow couch for a certain amount of time (approximately 2 
hours) while the machine gathers data.  During this time you will not be exposed to x -
rays, but rather a strong magnetic field and radiofrequency magnetic fields, which you will 
not feel.  You will, however, hear repetitive tappi[INVESTIGATOR_674034] (MR) scanner.  We will provide earplugs or headphones that you will be 
required to wear.  The space within the large magnet in which you lie is somewhat 
confin ed, although we have taken many steps to relieve the "claustrophobic" feeling.  
 
Risks: 
Magnetic fields do not cause harmful effects at the levels used in the MRI machine.  
However, the MR scanner uses a very strong magnet that will attract some metals and 
affect some electronic devices.  If you have a cardiac pacemaker or any other biomedica l 
device in or on your body, it is very important that you tell the operator/investigator 
immediately.  As metallic objects may experience a strong attraction to the magnet, it is 
also very important that you notify the operator of any metal objects (espec ially surgical 
clips), devices, or implants that are in or on your body before entering the magnet room.  
All such objects must be removed (if possible) before entering the magnet room.  In some 
cases, having those devices means you should not have an MRI scan performed.  In 
addition, watches and credit cards should also be removed as these could be damaged.  
You will be provided a way to secure these items.  If you have any history of head or eye 
injury involving metal fragments, if you have ever worked in  a metal shop, or if you could 
be pregnant, you should notify the operator/investigator .  You should also notify the 
operator/investigator if you have any tattoos on your body, including eyeliner and other 
permanent makeup .  Tattoos could become warm and irritated during the scan and 
remain so for several days.  If you would prefer not to participate in the MR scan due to 
the presence of tattoos on your body, please inform a research team member . 
 
There is a possibility that you will experience a localized twitching sensation due to the 
magnetic field changes during the scan. This is not unexpected and should not be 
painful. However, you may have the scan stopped at any time if this occurs.   
 
Some of the radio frequency imaging coils, imaging software and devices being used in 
your scan are not approved by [CONTACT_674037].  There is a small risk of heating from the cables associated wit h 
these devices.  Please report any heating sensation immediately.   
 
Dizziness or nausea may occur if you move your head rapi[INVESTIGATOR_138380].  
 
IF YOU FEEL DISCOMFORT AT ANY TIME, NOTIFY THE OPERATOR AND YOU CAN 
DISCONTINUE THE EXAM AT ANY TIME.  
 
The scans performed in this study are for specific research purposes and are not 
optimized to find medical abnormalities.  The investigators for this project may not be 
trained to perform medical diagnosis.  The investigators are not responsible for failur e to 
find existing abnormalities with these MRI scans.  However, on occasion the 
investigator may notice a finding on an MRI scan that seems abnormal.  If this occurs, a 
doctor will be asked to look at the images to see if any medical follow -up is needed.  If 
so, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_674038].  Because the images are taken using research settings they will not be made 
available for clinical purposes.  
 
Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
If you are pregnant, you may not participate in this study. You understand that if you are 
pregnant, you or your child may be exposed to an unknown risk. You agree to notify the 
investigator as soon as possible if you become pregnant, which may result in y our being 
withdrawn from the study.  
 
Tissue Banking for Future Research   
 
As part of this research  we would like to save any leftover samples for future research. 
Your samples will be stored at the Palo Alto VA or Stanford University and will be used 
for future research on knee osteoarthritis and related diseases. Your samples will used 
for research until the sample is all used up. Your sample and information about you will 
be labeled with a code that does not contain your name, initia ls, SSN, date of birth, or 
other ways that identify who you are.  The research we conduct with your samples  is 
being don e for research purposes only and we will not tell you or your doctor about the 
results of the research.   
Future Use of Private Information and/or Specimens  
Research using private information and/or specimens is an important way to try to 
understand human disease.  You are being given this information because the 
investigators want to save private information and/or specimens for future research.   
 
Identifiers might be removed from identifiable private information and/or identifiable 
specimens and, after such removal, the information and/or specimens could be used for 
future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies 
without additional informed consent from you.  
 
You may withdraw your permission for us to use your samples  for future research at any 
time. Contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Constance Chu or the study staff at [ADDRESS_910881]. Chu’s Stanford Collaborators.

o Other administrative reasons.  
o Unanticipated circumstances.  
 
POSSIBLE RISKS,  DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES  
 
This study involves the following risks, discomforts, and possible inconveniences:  
There is a discomfort of travel, time and effort involved with study participation.  
Risks of MRI: The MRI exam involves no exposure to x -rays or radioactivity. However, 
there is a potential risk of the strong magnetic field of the scanner attracting 
ferromagnetic (material with a high magnetic permeability) or metallic objects toward the 
magnet. For this reason you will be carefully screened for metallic objects in your 
possession before entering the magnet room. All such metallic objects will be collected 
and placed in a locker outside of the magnet room.  You will be screened for MRI saf ety 
(no pacemakers, implanted metal, claustrophobia, etc.) upon enrollment to the study.  
Risks of Radiographs: This research study may involve exposure to radiation from knee 
x-rays that is not necessary for medical care and is for research purposes only. The 
additional amount of radiation is approximately equal to 1 day of radiation exposure 
from natural sources l ike the sun, ground and water.  
Risk of blood collection: The risks of drawing blood include temporary discomfort from 
the needle stick, bruising, and rarely infection. A trained individual will draw the blood 
using sterile, disposable equipment. There is a chance that you will experienc e pain, 
bruising, excessive bleeding, feeling faint, or infection at the site of blood withdrawal.  
Risk of Gait Analysis: The only possible hazard is the slight risk that a subject will fall or 
feel fatigue down while performing the exam. All subjects may be at some risk of 
discomfort when the markers used to observe how their body moves while walking are 
removed. Removing th e markers is similar to taking off a band -aid, but some find this 
slightly uncomfortable. Subjects may feel some emotional stress while wearing 
garments provided for walking in the laboratory. Visitors or other observers during data 
collection are only permitted with participant concurrence which can be revoked at any 
time during the experi ment .  
There are procedures in this study may involve other risks, which are currently 
unforeseeable.  
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this 
study. However, we may be able to benefit the future population to have a better 
understanding of joint and soft tissue disease through your outcomes.  
 
ALTERNATIVES

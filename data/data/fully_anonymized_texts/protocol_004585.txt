Page 3 of 28 Revised  Template: November 10, [ZIP_CODE].0 Objectives
1.1 Specific aims:
This proposal aims
 to provide evidence to support use of the NU-FlexSIV Socket  
for persons with transfemoral (above-the-knee) amputation. This will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_96239] a prospective, assessor-blinded randomized cross-
over trial comparing comfort and functional performance with the NU-FlexSIV 
Socket to the standard-of-care ischial containment socket in persons with 
unilateral transfemoral amputation. 
The primary aims of the study are:
Aim 1: To demonstrate if the NU-FlexSIV Socket is more comfortable than the 
IC socket.
Aim 2: To demonstrate if the NU-FlexSIV Socket results in better functional 
performance than the
 IC socket.
Aim 3: To demonstrate the NU-FlexSIV Socket will result in better quality of life 
and “satisfaction with device” (i.e. prosthesis)
 than the IC socket.
1.2 Hypotheses to be tested:
Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that the
 NU-FlexSIV Socket  will provide increased 
comfort compared to the ischial containment socket.
Hypothesis 2a: We hypothesize  that the NU-FlexSIV Socket will allow greater 
prosthetic side hip range of motion, in particular increased hip 
extension, leading to increased prosthetic side step length and 
hence walking speed compared to the ischial containment socket. 
Hypothesis 2b: We hypothesize that step width and lateral trunk flexion  over the 
prosthetic limb will not differ between the NU-FlexSIV Socket and 
ischial containment socket.
Hypothesis 2c: We hypothesize  that the NU-FlexSIV Socket will result in faster 
times to perform the 5-Times Rapid Sit-to-Stand Test, Four Square 
Step Test and T-Test of Agility compared to the ischial 
containment socket.
Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that the NU-FlexSIV Socket  will result in better 
health-related quality of life and satisfaction with device as 
assessed using the OPUS compared to the ischial containment 
socket.
2.0 Background
2.1 Relevant prior  experience and gaps in current knowledge:
Current prosthetic sockets restrict function, lack comfort and  cause secondary 
health problems. Although designed to support the body and enable effective 
biomechanical load transfer during walking and other activities, prosthetic sockets 
interface with residual limb tissues that are neither accustomed nor well-suited to

Flexible Sub-Ischial
 Vacuum (NU-FlexSIV) Socket for Persons with Transfemoral 
Amputation
Page 4 of 28 Revised  Template: November 10, 2014the high pressure and shear loading that occurs  during ambulation with a 
prosthesis. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_160247] (>12 hours), lack of socket comfort is the most 
common complaint of prosthesis users. Prosthetic sockets lead to many issues due 
to high pressure, shear stress, temperature and moisture, all of which are 
exacerbated in highly active persons with amputation and those with irregular 
residual limbs (e.g. due to traumatic amputation that have irregular shape, 
extensive scarring, invaginations, skin grafts, painful neuromas, etc.). Residual 
limb skin problems include cysts, calluses, verrucous hyperplasia, allergic 
reactions, and bacterial or fungal infections. Residual limb skin problems have 
been reported by 25% to 63% of persons with amputation in the general 
population and problems have a negative influence on ability to perform 
household tasks, prosthesis use, social functioning, and participation in sports.
Sub-ischial sockets challenge conventional understanding of the biomechanics of 
transfemoral sockets, especially regarding coronal plane stability. In able-bodied 
walking, the hip abductors, primarily
 the gluteus medius, maintain pelvic control 
during single limb stance. Contraction of the hip abductors counters the moment 
created about the hip by [CONTACT_160277]. When the abductors are compromised, lateral trunk lean over 
the stance limb may be observed (often referred to as a Trendelenberg gait). In the 
IC socket, skeletal contact [CONTACT_160278], create a medial-lateral ‘skeletal lock’ for coronal plane control. For 
sub-ischial sockets, these forces still remain but the socket geometry believed 
necessary to control them is gone.
The mechanism by [CONTACT_160279]. Dillon (2007) stated that in an IC 
socket coronal plane pelvic stability is derived almost entirely from containment 
of the ischium and ischial ramus and that when containment is not achieved, 
coronal plane stability is poor. Dillon (2007) has also argued that the ability of 
any socket to provide coronal plane stability relies in part on the soft tissue, 
especially the adductors, being compressed to increase stiffness. Compression of 
soft tissues may occur to a larger extent when vacuum-assisted suspension is used 
because both the liner and socket are considerably under-sized, potentially 
contributing to coronal plane stability.
In contrast to existing transfemoral sockets, the NU-FlexSIV Socket does not 
impi[INVESTIGATOR_160248]; is highly flexible 
allowing muscles to move comfortably within the socket as they contract during 
activity and improving sitting comfort; and is held securely to the residual limb by 
[CONTACT_160280] a vacuum pump as well as compression from the liner and socket 
being undersized, making for a firmer connection to the prosthesis.

Flexible Sub-Ischial
 Vacuum (NU-FlexSIV) Socket for Persons with Transfemoral 
Amputation
Page 6 of 28 Revised  Template: November 10, 2014We recently described the  relationship between IC, tissue loading and socket 
comfort (Fatone, Dillon et al. 2015). Using a small randomized cross-over trial, it 
was shown that with the ischium contained, tissue loading did not influence 
socket comfort. Sockets without IC required high tissue loading to be as 
comfortable as those with IC, while suboptimal tissue loading compromised 
comfort.
The objective of our FY09 PRORP Technology Development Award  from DOD 
was to develop a highly flexible sub-ischial prosthetic socket with vacuum-
assisted suspension for highly active persons with transfemoral amputation. 
Hence, we used engineering analysis to characterize the socket, explored 
advanced manufacturing approaches for socket fabrication, characterized the 
function of commercially available vacuum pumps, designed and tested a hybrid 
mechanical/electrical pump, quantified the process of socket rectifications, and 
developed education materials to help teach this technique to other prosthetists. 
Additionally, preliminary evaluation of the NU-FlexSIV Socket with highly 
active persons with unilateral transfemoral amputation is underway at the Center 
for the Intrepid/Brooke Army Medical Center. To date, five of the six subjects we 
plan to test have been recruited for the study, with one subject having completed 
the entire protocol and four in process. At this point, subjects’ responses indicate 
that they prefer the NU-FlexSIV Socket to their usual IC socket. One common 
benefit reported was the ability to sit without the socket beneath the ischium. 
Objective outcome measures likewise support the superiority of the NU-FlexSIV 
Socket. Data from the first subject to complete the full testing protocol (Figure 3) 
showed that the NU-FlexSIV Socket resulted in 10° greater active peak hip 
flexion, 13° greater active peak hip extension and 9° more hip abduction; sit-to-
stand time improved by [CONTACT_34120] 2 seconds; hip range of motion increased 20.6°; T-
Test performance improved by 4 seconds (16%). Across 5 walking trials, hip 
range of motion increased 12.5° ± 1.2° with the NU-FlexSIV Socket and the hip 
was able to achieve extension during walking. Additional case data from two non-
military persons with transfemoral amputation is consistent with these findings. 
2.3 Scientific or scholarly background for rationale and significance of the 
research:
To our knowledge, only one other group
 has demonstrated the efficacy  of 
brimless (i.e., subischial) sockets for persons with transfemoral amputation (Kahle

randomized cross-over trial, gait
 and balance were found to be equivalent between 
sockets (IC and brimless) but subjects preferred the brimless socket. In this case, 
it appears that a rigid IC socket with a flexible brim was cut down to form the 
brimless socket. Similar improvements in comfort along with better functional 
outcomes may occur with sockets that are deliberately designed to be subischial, 
such as the NU-FlexSIV Socket.

Study Endpoints
8.1
Primary and  secondary study endpoints:
Our primary end point, socket comfort, will be assessed using the Socket 
Comfort Score (Hanspal, Fisher et al. 2003) an ordinal scale where 0 = the 
most uncomfortable socket fit imaginable
 and 10 = the most comfortable 
socket fit. Poor socket comfort is one of the most common issues 
experienced by [CONTACT_160284]. Like pain, comfort is subjective and 
difficult to measure. Therefore, pain-measurement methods such as the 
numerical rating scale (NRS) were used as models for quantifying and 
communicating socket comfort. The Socket Comfort Score asks the standard 
question, “On a [ADDRESS_185988] comfortable socket fit, how 
would you score the comfort of the socket fit of your artificial limb at the 
moment?”
Our secondary end point, functional performance, will be assessed  using 
instrumented motion analysis to record biomechanics of walking at different 
speeds, a 5-time Rapid Sit-to-Stand Test (RSTS), Four-Square-Step Test 
(FSST), and
 T-test of Agility. The 5-time Rapid Sit-to-Stand Test, Four-

9.0 Procedures Involved
9.1
Study design:
The clinical trial will be
 an assessor-blinded prospective  randomized cross-
over trial wherein participants with unilateral transfemoral amputation will 
be randomized to using one of two socket conditions (i.e., sub-ischial or 
ischial containment) before crossing over to the other socket condition. 
Random allocation (computer-generated) utilizing blocks of random size 
will be used to assign the initial treatment condition. The trial will be 
balanced such that all subjects will receive all treatments (i.e., both socket 
conditions) and that all subjects will participate for the same number of 
periods (i.e., two).
9.2 Research procedures:
The study is composed of two
 phases for each socket: socket  preparation 
and then 6 weeks of socket wear during which 3 identical data collection 
sessions will be held (week 1, 3 weeks and 6 weeks). 
Socket Preparation Phase: 
All sockets will be made following standard clinical  procedures that include 
taking an impression (i.e., cast) of the residual limb, converting the negative 
residual limb model to a positive mold made of plaster of Paris, rectifying 
the positive mold using the rectification procedures specific to each socket 
design, thermoforming a clear diagnostic check socket, and ultimately 
manually fabricating, fitting and aligning a definitive socket.
Data Collection:
At each visit we will collect the following data:
1.Socket Comfort Score (SCS) – The SCS is a simple rating of comfort on 
a scale of [ADDRESS_185989] comfortable socket fit. 
2.Orthotic and Prosthetic Users’ Survey (OPUS) – The OPUS is a set of 
surveys that evaluate the subject’s perception
 of function, quality of life, and 
satisfaction with the socket and prosthesis. The lower extremity function 
survey has 20 questions rated on a 5-point scale; the quality of life survey 
has 23 questions rated on a 5-point scale; and the satisfaction with device 
survey has 9 questions rated on a 5-point scale.

Page 11 of 28 Revised  Template: November 10, [ZIP_CODE].Biomechanics of  Walking – How the subjects walks with each socket 
will be measured in a computerized motion analysis lab. Small reflective 
markers are taped to anatomical landmarks on the legs, pelvis and arms 
using hypoallergenic tape. The subject then walks back and forth at their 
own comfortable walking speed while cameras on the wall record where the 
reflective markers are in space and force plates mounted flush in the floor 
measure the force applied by [CONTACT_160285].
4.5-Time Rapid Sit-to-Stand Test (RSTS) - The RSTS measures hip range 
of motion, lower limb muscle strength, and balance.
 The test involves 
measuring the time it takes for the subject to stand up and sit down five 
times with their arms folded across their chest as fast as they can. They will 
do this test twice with [ADDRESS_185990] (FSST) - The FSST evaluates dynamic standing 
stability and involves rapid steppi[INVESTIGATOR_160251]. 
The obstacle consists of a square cross made by [CONTACT_160286]. A steppi[INVESTIGATOR_160252]. They 
must try to complete the steppi[INVESTIGATOR_160253]. Both feet must make contact [CONTACT_160287]. If possible, the subject must face forward during the entire test. They 
will do this test twice with [ADDRESS_185991] of Agility (T-Test) - The T-Test is typi[INVESTIGATOR_160254].
 Four markers are set out on the floor in the shape of a T. 
The subject starts at the marker located at the bottom of the T. When the 
investigator says “go” the subject moves forward as fast as they can to touch 
the second marker, they then shuffle sideways to the right to touch the third 
marker, and then they shuffle to the left, past the second marker, to touch the 
fourth marker. The subject then shuffles back to their right to touch the 
second marker and then moves backwards as fast as they can to touch the 
first marker. The test is timed and should be performed as fast as possible. 
The test is repeated three times and the best time is used. The subject will be 
allowed to rest for 3 minutes between tests.
9.3 (a) Procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of 
risks:
All socket
 fabrication procedures used in this study are consistent with 
standard clinical care procedures. The standard
 clinical process of making a 
transfemoral prosthetic socket involves some loss of modesty and privacy 
given the intimate fit of the standard-of-care Ischial Containment socket 
with your groin and buttocks. Certified Prosthetists are trained to ensure 
privacy during this process. Risk is further minimized by [CONTACT_160288] a prosthesis for at least two years and are therefore familiar 
with the process.

Page 12 of 28 Revised  Template: November 10, 2014It is possible that one or both sockets may not be comfortable or that one or 
both sockets may rub the residual limb and
 cause redness, blistering, or a 
sore, just as any new or ill-fitting socket may do. Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will help minimize the risk of these problems by [CONTACT_160289] a prosthesis for at least two years, have a residual 
limb that is stable in volume and free from any wounds and no skin/residual 
limb issues that make fitting a socket problematic. Subjects will actively 
contribute to minimizing residual limb problems by [CONTACT_160290], informing investigators of problems as soon as they occur, and 
working with the study prosthetists to resolve any issues.
Transfemoral amputees are generally at  greater risk for stumbling, trippi[INVESTIGATOR_160255]. The risk of stumbling, 
trippi[INVESTIGATOR_160256]. All tests are standardized clinical outcome measures 
used with amputees and will be performed under controlled lab conditions to 
ensure that the subject is not distracted from the task and that all other 
conditions such as ambient lighting, floor surfaces, etc. are favorable, 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_160257]. Subjects are asked to perform some of the tests “as 
fast as they can” rather than pushing them to exceed their own comfortable 
limits, further serving to minimize risk.
(b) Devices used in this research, the purpose of their use, and their  
regulatory approval status:
Two designs of custom made prosthetic 
sockets will be compared in this 
research: (1) the Ischial Containment 
(IC) Socket and (2)
 the NU-FlexSIV 
Socket (Figure 5).
The standard-of-care IC socket design 
will be determined on a per-subject
 
basis by [CONTACT_160291]. 
However, subject selection criteria will 
serve to decrease the variability in 
patient presentation such that it will 
minimize the choice of suspension 
options. Therefore, the IC socket will 
consist of a flexible inner socket with 
rigid frame using either skin fit suction 
suspension with a one way valve or silicon liner with locking mechanism. If 
a liner is used it will be sized according to manufacturer recommendations.
The NU-FlexSIV Socket will also be custom fit to each subject  using 
standard clinical practice procedures. Subischial socket trim lines are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 25mm distal to the ischial tuberosity and 50mm distal to the 
greater trochanter and while it also has a narrower medio-lateral than 
Figure 5 Ischial Containment 
Socket (left) and NU-FlexSIV 
Socket (right).

than the IC socket. All subjects will be fit with an undersized liner (i.e., liner 
one size smaller than the manufacture recommendation based on 
measurements) over which the sub-ischial socket will be fitted. Using the 
rectification procedures specific for this design, sockets are also 4-6% 
undersized. Suspension will be achieved using an Össur Unity mechanical 
vacuum pump.
With the exception of the  prosthetic foot, prosthetic components distal to the 
socket (the knee and pylon) will be standardized within subjects. Subjects 
will use their current prosthetic knee so as to minimize the burden of 
learning to walk with a different knee. All subjects will be provided an 
Össur LP Variflex foot with Unity Pump to wear with both test sockets. This 
foot is suitable for K3 and K4 ambulators52 and can interface with any 
existing componentry while also providing a noiseless vacuum pump for use 
with the sub-ischial socket condition.
The purpose of both sockets is to restore the ability to  walk for someone 
with a transfemoral amputation. Prosthetic sockets form the interface 
between the residual limb and prosthesis, allowing for support of body 
weight and transfer of forces between the amputee and the prosthesis.
The type of external limb prosthesis we propose to evaluate as part of this 
clinical trial is considered by [CONTACT_160292] (FDA) as a 
Class I device (low risk) and 510k exempt (although not necessarily IDE 
exempt). As part of our current IRB approval for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_160258] (STU00033446), a determination was made by [CONTACT_160293] a custom device, necessitating that the Northwestern 
University Institutional Review Board (NU-IRB) make a significant risk 
determination. The NU-IRB made a determination that the use of the device 
constituted a non‐significant risk, which meant that we did not have to apply 
for an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA.
According to FDA regulation 21CFR890 (External  Limb Prosthetic 
Component) our device meets that requirement but does not have an 
automatic exemption. Hence, whether our device is subject to FDA 
regulation for this proposed work depends upon NU-IRB determination of 
whether the device as proposed for use in this study is a significant risk 
device. If the NU-IRB determines as it did previously for a similar smaller 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_160259] a non-significant risk, then we will not 
be subject to FDA regulation and will not need to apply for an IDE. 
According to FDA requirements, as the manufacturer of the device, the 
Principal Investigator (PI) can
 make the determination that this is a non-

11.0 Data and Specimen Management
11.1
Data analysis:
Before analyses begin,
 all variables will be  plotted using histograms to 
inspect the shape of distributions and to check for outliers. We will not drop 
cases nor transform variables but if we identify any possibility that 
assumptions have been violated, we will employ alternative analysis 
approaches. As part of data screening, we will describe the amount of data 
that are missing, and we will compare participants with and without missing 
data. 
Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that the NU-FlexSIV Socket  will provide 
increased comfort compared to the ischial containment socket.
Our primary end point is  Socket Comfort Score at [ADDRESS_185992] a sensitivity to socket change of 1 to 3 points (Hanspal, 
Fisher et al. 2003). Additionally, it has been argued that the Socket Comfort 
Score may be considered a continuous variable, and therefore suitable for 
parametric analysis, given the large number of ordered categories and the 
linear nature of changes in socket comfort with different configurations of 
socket conditions (Fatone, Dillon et al. 2015). Hence, a matched pairs t-test 
(alpha=0.05) will be used to assess the primary outcome, Socket Comfort 
Score.
Hypothesis 2a: We hypothesize  that the NU-FlexSIV Socket will allow 
greater prosthetic side hip range of motion, in particular increased hip 
extension, leading to increased prosthetic side step length and hence walking 
speed compared to the ischial containment socket.
Hypothesis 2b: We hypothesize that step width and lateral trunk flexion  over 
the prosthetic limb will not  differ between the NU-FlexSIV Socket and 
ischial containment socket.
For these secondary hypotheses, data analysis  will include the following gait 
variables: walking speed (m/s), step width (m), step length (m), sagittal 
plane hip range of motion (degrees), maximum hip extension (degrees), and 
lateral trunk lean over the prosthetic limb during stance (degrees). A 
multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA, alpha=0.05) will be used to 
compare gait variables across socket conditions as it is the most rigorous 
approach given the relationship that exists between these dependent 
variables (e.g., walking velocity and step length are correlated). The 
challenge of this approach is being convinced that underlying assumptions 
are met.
Hypothesis 2c: We hypothesize  that the NU-FlexSIV Socket will result in 
faster times to perform  the 5-Times Rapid Sit-to-Stand Test, Four Square 
Step Test and T-Test of Agility compared to the ischial containment socket.
IRB #: STU00201300 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 4/16/2020 through 4/15/2021.

Flexible Sub-Ischial
 Vacuum (NU-FlexSIV) Socket for Persons with Transfemoral 
Amputation
Page 16 of 28 Revised  Template: November 10, 2014The difference in these timed performance tests across socket conditions  
will be tested using repeated measures t-tests with alpha=0.05 which will be 
adjusted using the Bonferroni correction to account for Type 1 error.
Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that the NU-FlexSIV Socket  will result in 
better health-related quality of life and satisfaction with device as assessed 
using the OPUS compared to the ischial containment  socket.
The OPUS uses Likert scale responses for each item of each module.  
However, these responses can be converted into a single score for each 
module. If assumptions of normality are met, analysis with parametric 
procedures can be used to assess differences in module scores between 
sockets. Hence, we will use repeated measures t-tests with alpha=0.05 which 
will be adjusted using the Bonferroni correction to account for Type 1 error.
11.2 Power analysis:
To determine a
 sample size estimate, we have  utilized data obtained from a 
previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].44 In that study, we collected Socket Comfort Scores 
from six persons with unilateral transfemoral amputation wearing an ischial 
ramal containment socket and the same socket with a wider medio-lateral 
dimension (effect size, d = 0.754). Using the G*Power computer program, 
this effect size was used to estimate sample size. This data was used because 
we do not have pi[INVESTIGATOR_160261]. For a 2-tailed 
matched pairs t-test we would need a total sample size of [ADDRESS_185993] numbers we will recruit 35 
persons with unilateral transfemoral amputation.
11.3 Steps to be taken to secure the data to maintain confidentiality during 
storage, use, and transmission:
All personnel involved
 with the study have or will complete  IRB required 
training. 
Subjects will be assigned  a study code at enrollment and all study related 
forms to be completed by [CONTACT_160296]. Forms that require the subject’s identity and cannot be 
coded (e.g. payment paperwork) will only be completed at NUPOC and not 
at the clinical sites. The master list of study codes will be maintained at 
NUPOC by [CONTACT_978]. This master list will only be maintained in hard copy 
format, in a locked cabinet in the PI’s office which is also locked.
The collaborating prosthetists will only create  and use the forms required for 
recording the fitting and fabrication of their particular socket and these can 
be de-identified. Once the subject has completed that phase of the study, 
forms are given in person or by [CONTACT_160297] [INVESTIGATOR_160262].
All electronic data maintained at NUPOC is on encrypted and password 
protected computers located in locked rooms and all
 paper files are stored in 
IRB #: STU00201300 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 4/16/2020 through 4/15/2021.

All data entered into RedCap will be de-identified summary data needed for 
statistical analysis.
11.4
Procedures to be used for quality  control of collected data:
A cross-over study  has two advantages  over both parallel and non-crossover 
longitudinal study designs. First, the influence of confounding covariates is 
reduced because each cross-over patient serves as their own control. This is 
particularly important given the custom nature of prosthetic interventions. 
Second, cross-over designs can be statistically efficient, requiring fewer 
subjects than non-cross-over designs. This is of particular benefit for 
prosthetic studies given the cost, time and effort involved in providing 
custom prosthetic devices for use every day during the study. Cross-over 
studies are typi[INVESTIGATOR_160263], which in this case the most 
likely is shrinking of the residual limb during the first intervention phase. 
This shrinkage is typi[INVESTIGATOR_160264] a new, more tightly 
fitting socket is provided to a person with amputation. However, the effect 
of shrinkage is accounted for by [CONTACT_160298]. While a washout period is not strictly necessary, it is effectively 
included as subjects will need to transition back to their usual, pre-study 
socket/prosthesis while the second test socket is fabricated.
Socket allocation will be concealed from the investigators until after a 
subject is
 enrolled. The starting socket design will be enclosed in 
sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Envelopes will be opened 
sequentially and only after the participant’s name [CONTACT_160310].
Blinding of prosthetic interventions is challenging given that  they are 
devices that must be custom-fabricated and donned each day by [CONTACT_423]. 
Hence, for this study only the assessor, our research engineer, [CONTACT_160312], will be blinded. To maintain blinding the assessor will remain 
uninvolved in any aspect of the study except administration of performance 
and patient-reported measures and 
processing motion analysis data. 
The assessor will not be present 
for motion analysis
 data 
collection given that this 
requires exposure of the 
prosthesis and socket for 
appropriate marker placement. 
Since all that is recorded is the 
location of retro-reflective 
markers on the subject, it is not

Flexible Sub-Ischial
 Vacuum (NU-FlexSIV) Socket for Persons with Transfemoral 
Amputation
Page 18 of 28 Revised  Template: November 10, 2014possible to tell while processing the motion analysis data what 
socket the
 subject was wearing because the data is viewed only as a 
stick figure (Figure 6). 
Performance and patient-reported measures  can be administered 
fully clothed, which will disguise the socket being tested. During 
these assessments, subjects will be instructed not to reveal to the 
assessor which socket they are wearing.
Given the customized, manually-fabricated nature of prosthetic sockets, 
each test
 socket will be provided to study subjects by a separate Certified 
Prosthetist known for their skill with the particular socket design. This will 
ensure that each socket is the best and most consistent example of each 
particular socket design.
Since accommodation to sockets is unknown, data will be collected at 
baseline (within one week of definitive socket
 fitting) and after [ADDRESS_185994] retention. Since we anticipate that one socket will be more 
comfortable than the other, it is possible that some subjects will find it 
challenging to use the less comfortable socket for a long period of time. By 
[CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_160265] (i.e., 6 weeks) we hope to retain 
as many subjects as possible. Additionally, by [CONTACT_160299] [ADDRESS_185995] prostheses will allow monitoring 
of every day socket use. This will provide information regarding compliance 
with use of
 each prosthesis. As a secondary consideration, it will allow us to 
check whether there is a relationship between comfort and step activity. 
When assessing the biomechanics of walking  data consistency will be 
assured by (1) collecting all data in the same laboratory using the same 
instrumentation; (2) having marker placement conducted by [CONTACT_160300]; and (3) having a single person post-process all the data.
Since we hypothesize that the sub-ischial socket will be more comfortable 
than the standard-of-care ischial containment socket, it may be difficult to
 
convince current wearers of the sub-ischial socket to revert to wearing an 
ischial containment socket every day for the time required by [CONTACT_1758]. It is 
also likely that those who have already adopted the sub-ischial socket will 
be particularly biased against the ischial containment socket, leading to 
larger differences in our primary endpoint. To account for this issue, we 
plan to recruit only those patients with no previous experience of the sub-
ischial socket.

12.0 Provisions to Monitor the  Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects
N/A
13.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*
13.1
Anticipated circumstances  under which subjects will be withdrawn 
from the research without their consent:
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_160266], fail to communicate about socket 
and residual limb problems, and fail to work with the prosthetists to resolve 
socket fitting or residual limb issues.
13.2 Procedures for  orderly termination:
If the above circumstances occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_160267]. Depending 
on what phase of
 the study the subject is in, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_160268]. This is required 
because the study prosthetist must place the subject’s prosthetic knee back 
into their regular prosthesis. 
13.3 Procedures to be followed when  subjects withdraw from the research:
If subjects decide to leave the research, they must contact [CONTACT_160301]. This requires that the study prosthetist place their prosthetic 
knee back into their regular prosthesis.

Potential benefits  that individual subjects may experience from 
taking part in the research. Include as may be useful for the 
IRB’s consideration, the probability, magnitude, and duration of 
the potential benefits:
Possible benefits that invidivual subject’s may experience from 
participating in
 this research include (1) contributing to the 
development of evidence to support whether or not the new socket 
design is more comfortable and functional than the current standard-
of-care transfemoral socket; and (2) receipt of one or two new 
sockets. 
Since the sockets made for  this study are made to uniquely fit 
individual subjects, they will be allowed to keep either or both 
sockets assuming they fit well. Sockets will be provided to the 
subject at the end of the study to take to their regular prosthetist who 
can work with them if they want to continue wearing one of the 
sockets.

Amputation
Page 26 of 28 Revised  Template: November 10, 2014have a need to review this information. However, we cannot  promise 
complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy the subject’s 
information include the IRB and other representatives of Northwestern 
University required to process various paperwork related to research (e.g. 
subject payment), the US Department of Defense (DOD), the DOD Human 
Research Protections Office, the Veterans Administration, and collaborators 
at Scheck and Siress Prosthetics, Orthotics and Pedorthics. 
Subjects are required to interact with both study prosthetists, the motion 
analysis lab manager, the research engineer and the
 PI. This is the minimum 
interaction required to conduct the study. However, not all investigators 
need to have access to all the personal information collected as part of this 
project. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_160274].
25.2 Steps we will take to make the subjects feel at ease with the research 
situation:
The standard clinical
 process of making a  transfemoral prosthetic socket 
involves some loss of modesty and privacy given the intimate fit of the 
standard-of-care Ischial Containment socket with your groin and buttocks. 
Certified Prosthetists are trained to ensure these activities take place in a 
private space. We are also recruiting subjects who have used a prosthesis for 
at least two years and are therefore familiar with the process as this will ease 
their experience of the study procedures.

Drugs or  Devices
30.1 Plans to store, handle, and administer devices:
Both prosthetic sockets
 are custom-made  to fit the individual and as 
such no storage is needed and they cannot be used with other 
subjects as they won’t fit.
30.2 Information about claim of an abbreviated IDE (non-significant 
risk device):
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_160275]. The 
type of external limb prosthesis we propose to evaluate as part of this 
clinical trial is considered by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA) as a Class I device (low risk). As part of our current IRB 
IRB #: STU00201300 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 4/16/2020 through 4/15/2021.

made by [CONTACT_160307] a custom device, 
necessitating that the Northwestern University Institutional Review 
Board (NU-IRB) make a significant risk determination. The NU-IRB 
made a determination that the use of the device constituted a 
non‐significant risk, which meant that we did not have to apply for 
an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA.
Our device can be classified as an  external limb prosthetic 
component according to [ADDRESS_186015]-of-care Ischial Containment Socket we 
contend that the NU-FlexSIV Socket is a design variant of the type 
of sockets used safely every day by [CONTACT_160308]. Hence, 
we believe that our socket can be considered minimal risk.

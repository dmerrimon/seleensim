1.1 SYNOPSIS 
Title: A Phase 2a Study of Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Drug-
Delivering Contact [CONTACT_745474]-BMT1 in Patients With Primary Open-
Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension 
Study Description: This will be an open-label, phase 2a clinical study. Beginning 
[ADDRESS_1019706] lens tolerability. Five patients with treated 
or treatment-naïve primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular 
hypertension (OHT) in both eyes who have successfully passed the 
acclimation screening will be enrolled. All previously treated eyes 
will have a washout period prior to enrollment. At least one eye 
(called the study eye) will have untreated (after washout, if 
applicable) intraocular pressure (IOP) between 22 mmHg and 34 
mmHg (inclusive). If the fellow eye does not meet this IOP criterion, 
it must have an untreated IOP (following washout, if applicable) 
within 5 mmHg of the study eye without exceeding the 34-mmHg 
maximum. Five patients will be enrolled to receive LL-BMT1 
(medicated) contact [CONTACT_745476] a packaging solution containing 
. During the 7-day treatment 
period, patients will be assessed for safety and IOP reduction. 
Adverse events (AEs) and treatment-related serious adverse event 
[SAE] will be monitored, as will other safety measures, including 
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and 
contact [CONTACT_745477]. The study hypothesis is that no safety 
concerns are revealed. 
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of 
LL -BMT1 in patients with POAG or OHT. Additional objectives of 
this study are to evaluate the tolerability and IOP-lowering effects of 
LL‑BMT1 in patients with POAG or OHT. 
Endpoints: Primary safety endpoint: AE rate 
Secondary safety endpoints : percent of patients with ≥5-mmHg 
increase from baseline in IOP at each visit; abnormal slit-lamp 
biomicroscopy findings at the Baseline, Day 1, and Day 7 Visits; 
contact [CONTACT_745478] 7 Visit; and change from 
baseline in Contact [CONTACT_434450]-8 (CLDEQ-8) 
results at the Day 7 Visit 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  change from baseline in IOP at each
visit

Leo Lens Technology Co., Inc. 21 December [ZIP_CODE] INTRODUCTION
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Therapy for glaucoma and ocular hypertension today includes pharmaceuticals, laser 
trabeculoplasty, and surgery. Each of these treatments has been shown to be effective in lowering 
elevated IOP as well as to slow the progression of glaucomatous visual field loss ( Kass 2002;
Lichter 2001 ; AGIS Investigators 2000 ; CNTGSG 1998 ). 
Pharmacotherapy with eye drops requires patients, or their care givers, to be adherent to the 
dosing schedule, as well as to be able to appropriately instill eyedrops. Even experienced patients 
at a private practice clinic are less than perfect in both adherence and performance ( Robin 2007 ; 
Stone 2009 ).  
In order to optimize therapy, a wide range of drug delivery technologies have been evaluated in 
ophthalmology ( Novack 2009 ). Recently, an intracameral drug delivery system using 
bimatoprost (Durysta®, Allergan) was approved by [CONTACT_55257] ( Craven 2020 ; Lewis 2017 ). 
While providing ocular hypotensive efficacy for at least [ADDRESS_1019711] has been 
associated with concerns about the health of the corneal endothelium ( Durysta prescribing 
information [PI] ).
Thus, there is a continuing need for safe and effective pharmacotherapeutic delivery systems for 
the treatment of elevated IOP.
2.2 BACKGROUND  
Leo Lens Technology Co., Inc. has developed the MediPrint™ process that allows active 
pharmaceutical ingredients to be inkjet printed onto FDA-approved, Group [ADDRESS_1019712] lenses (eg, BIOMEDICS
® 55 [ocufilcon D] soft [hydrophilic] contact [CONTACT_13276]). Currently, 
Leo Lens Technology is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a lens that has bimatoprost digitally printed onto the anterior 
surface of the contact [CONTACT_745486]. This product, called LL-BMT1, is designed to reduce 
elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or OHT. LL-BMT1 is a preservative-
free, continuous wear (7-day and 6-night) contact [CONTACT_745487]-release bimatoprost 
to the eye. This product is intended to provide a novel, sustained delivery mechanism for 
bimatoprost and has the potential to reduce progression of glaucoma and the rate of vision loss in 
patients with glaucoma or OHT, compared to the current standard of care.  
Bimatoprost has been approved by [CONTACT_745488] (Lumigan®New 
Drug Application [NDA] 021275 and NDA 022184; Lumigan PI ), several abbreviated NDAs, 
Latisse® NDA 022369, and Durysta® NDA 211911. NDA 021275 has been discontinued by [CONTACT_745489], Allergan. However, it is Sponsor’s understanding that this was not for safety or efficacy 
reasons.  
The bimatoprost in LL-BMT1 is printed on a contact [CONTACT_745490]-approved, Group [ADDRESS_1019713] lenses (eg, BIOMEDICS® 55 [ocufilcon D] soft [hydrophilic] contact

LL-BMT10001                                                                            CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2 
Leo Lens Technology Co., Inc. 21 December 2020lenses). The contact [CONTACT_745491]-BMT1 was approved by [CONTACT_745492] P890023. 
Information on this product is provided in the instructions for use ( Biomedics 55 PI ). 
2.[ADDRESS_1019714] eyedrops include pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] 
(including blepharal pi[INVESTIGATOR_745465]), eyelash changes, intraocular 
inflammation, macular edema, and hypersensitivity. In controlled clinical trials, the most 
common adverse reaction was conjunctival hyperemia (31%). Approximately 1.6% of patients 
discontinued therapy due to conjunctival hyperemia. Other adverse drug reactions (reported in 
1% to 4% of patients) with Lumigan® 0.01% included conjunctival edema, conjunctival 
hemorrhage, eye irritation, eye pain, eye pruritus, erythema of eyelid, eyelids pruritus, growth of 
eyelashes, hypertrichosis, instillation site irritation, punctate keratitis, skin hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
vision blurred, and visual acuity reduced. In post-marketing use, AEs reported also include 
asthma-like symptoms, dizziness, dry eye, dyspnea, eye discharge, eye edema, foreign body 
sensation, headache, hypersensitivity (including signs and symptoms of eye allergy and allergic 
dermatitis), lacrimation increased, and periorbital and lid changes (including deepening of the eyelid sulcus; Lumigan PI ). 
The bimatoprost in LL-BMT1 is printed on Group [ADDRESS_1019715] lenses. 
The potential benefit to patients in this study is the lowering of IOP without the use of daily 
eyedrops.

•Change from baseline in IOP at each visitIOP assessment is necessary 
to determine the efficacy of 
an IOP-lowering device.
[ADDRESS_1019716] one eye (called the study eye) will have untreated (after 
washout, if applicable) IOP between 22 mmHg and 34 mmHg (inclusive). If both eyes meet this 
criterion, then the eye with the higher IOP will be selected as the study eye. If the IOP in both 
qualified eyes is the same, then the right eye will be selected as the study eye. If the fellow eye 
does not meet this IOP criterion, it must have an untreated IOP (following washout, if 
applicable) within [ADDRESS_1019717]

5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS
During this study, participants will be instructed to refrain from using a sauna, hot tub, and 
partaking in any water-related activities, including swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving. All 
participants will be instructed to avoid consuming fluids for 1 hour prior to each study visit.  
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are 
not subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Screen failures can be identified at the Screening Visit, at either of the Acclimation Visits, or at the Baseline Visit. A 
minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen 
failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 
publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAEs. 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) may not be 
rescreened.  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION
Because this study will enroll only 5 patients with a duration of less than 6 weeks (including washout), no particular recruitment or retention strategies are expected to be necessary. Enrolled patients who fail acclimation screening will be replaced until at least [ADDRESS_1019726] lens (marketed as ocufilcon D; Figure 1 ) that has had bimatoprost coated onto the 
anterior surface of the lens via an inkjet printer.

treatment), at which time the investigator will remove the lenses. Patients will not remove the 
lenses themselves during the study. 
6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING/STORAGE/ACCOUNTABILITY
6.2.1 ACQUISITION AND ACCOUNTABILITY
LL-BMT1 lenses will be shipped to the investigator from the Sponsor’s manufacturing site. The 
lenses should be handled according to normal Group 4 lens procedures 
  
24
LL-BMT10001                                                                            CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2 
Leo Lens Technology Co., Inc. 21 December 2020If a LL-BMT1 lens is damaged during removal from the storage vial or during the thorough 
rinsing procedure, then a new LL-BMT1 lens can be used by [CONTACT_093].  
  
When lenses are removed and handled during the study period while the patient’s IOP is 
measured, the lens should be held by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_745469] a sterile plastic 
tweezer with a soft tip. When the lens is reinserted in the patient’s eye, one drop of sterile saline 
solution should be added to the bowl of the lens prior to reinsertion in the eye. 
Investigator should take care with lens handling, especially during removal of the lens for IOP 
assessment. If a lens is damaged during removal, a new lens cannot be inserted in the patient’s 
eye. Patients can remain on the study if at least one LL-BMT1 lens is able to be reinserted in one 
of the patient’s eyes.  
Any unused contact [CONTACT_745498].

cannot be delayed until the end of the study to determine if the patient can participate and/or 
continue in the study. Prior to study treatment initiation, any current glaucoma medications must 
be washed out using the below schedule (but washout should not commence until after written 
informed consent has been obtained): 
•4 days washout for parasympathomimetic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_745470] 
•2 weeks washout for sympathomimetics and alpha agonists  
•[ADDRESS_1019731], ROCK 
inhibitors, and prostaglandin agonists 
6.5.1 RESCUE MEDICINE
The Sponsor will not supply rescue medication. Should the IOP at any time during the study be 
elevated 10 mmHg above baseline (after washout, if applicable), the lens will be removed and a 
different IOP-lowering medication should be prescribed at the discretion of the investigator. The 
patient will be discontinued from study intervention but will continue in the study.

7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PATIENT
DISCONTINUATION
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION
Patients may be discontinued from study intervention for any of the following reasons: 
•Investigator decision: The investigator can decide that the patient should be discontinued 
from study intervention for any reason. 
•Patient decision: Patients who decide to discontinue study intervention should be 
explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision, and any AE information elicited should be documented. Preferably the patient should withdraw 
consent in writing and, if the patient refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should 
document and sign the reason for the patient’s failure to withdraw consent in writing. The 
patient is lost to follow-up after a reasonable number of attempts to contact [CONTACT_102] 
(including documented phone calls and/or emails, and a certified letter) have been 
completed. 
•Sponsor decision: The Sponsor or its designee can stop the patient’s participation in the 
study for medical, safety, regulatory, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, 
regulations, and GCP guidelines. 
•Pregnancy: If a patient becomes pregnant during the study, the patient will be 
immediately discontinued from study intervention. Only pregnancies considered by [CONTACT_941]

LL-BMT10001                                                                            CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2 
Leo Lens Technology Co., Inc. 21 December 2020investigator as related to study drug (e.g., resulting from an interaction between study 
drug and a contraceptive drug) are considered AEs unto themselves. However, all 
pregnancies with an estimated conception date that occurred during the study must be 
recorded in the AE section of the eCRF and investigators must actively follow up, 
document, and report on the outcome of all pregnancies. 
•AE: If the investigator decides that the study intervention should be discontinued because 
of an AE, the investigational product is to be discontinued and appropriate measures are to be taken. The Sponsor or its designee is to be alerted immediately. 
•Damage to both LL-BMT1 lenses: The investigator should take care with lens handling, 
especially during removal of the lens for IOP assessment. If a lens is damaged during removal, a new lens cannot be inserted in the patient’s eye. Patients can remain on the 
study if at least one LL-BMT1 lens is able to be reinserted in one of the patient’s eyes. If 
both lenses are damaged during removal, then the patient will not be allowed to continue 
with study procedures.  
In all of these circumstances, patients should continue to attend all remaining study visits and 
undergo all scheduled testing. 
7.[ADDRESS_1019732] to follow-up.  
Patients may decide to discontinue participation in the study; any such patient withdrawing from 
the study will be asked to complete the Early Termination Visit assessments. The reason for 
patient discontinuation from the study will be recorded on the eCRF. No patients who 
discontinue from the study will be replaced under any circumstances. 
7.[ADDRESS_1019733] be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:
oThe site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_745499]/or should continue in the 
study.
oBefore a patient is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and a 
certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent 
methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical 
record or study file.

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
•Goldmann applanation tonometry.  Intraocular pressure will be measured with a 
Goldmann applanation tonometer that is calibrated pre-study and monthly during study 
participation .
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS
Abnormal findings that are of clinical significance will be recorded as AEs on the eCRFs.  
•Ultrasound pachymetry. Corneal thickness will be measured using an ultrasound 
pachymeter.
•Humphrey visual field assessment. Visual field (perimetry) will be assessed using a 
Humphrey Field Analyzer. If Humphrey visual field assessment has been completed within [ADDRESS_1019735] to be repeated at the Screening Visit 
•Contact [CONTACT_19550] (CL) Assessment: Assessments will include contact [CONTACT_745484], 
movement with blinking, and lens surface wettability/deposits, as described in ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2012.
•Heart rate and blood pressure. Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured by a 
manual or automated sphygmomanometer. 
•Pregnancy testing.  Pregnancy testing will be performed using a human chorionic 
gonadotropin pregnancy urine dipstick test on women of childbearing potential. 
•Best-corrected visual acuity.  BCVA will be quantified using the ETDRS visual acuity 
protocol (at a distance of 3 m) and the number of letters read correctly will be recorded 
on the eCRF. 
•Biomicroscopy.  Biomicroscopy will be performed by [CONTACT_41157]-lamp examination of 
conjunctiva, cornea, and iris with findings reported on a scale of 0 = none, 0.5 = trace, 1 
= mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The status of the lens will be assessed using the 
Age-Related Eye Disease Study scale. 
•Goldmann applanation tonometry.  IOP will be measured with a Goldmann applanation 
tonometer. During the study, the LL-BMT1 contact [CONTACT_745500]. Of particular significance, all lens insertions and removals will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_093]. IOP will be assessed [ADDRESS_1019736] measurement was obtained. For each eye, IOP was analyzed as the mean

•Conjunctival hyperemia. The Efron Grading Scales for Contact [CONTACT_745502] a conjunctival hyperemia scale.
Unscheduled visits can be included if safety concerns arise. Additional examinations may be 
performed as necessary to ensure the safety and wellbeing of patients during the study. eCRFs 
should be completed for each unscheduled visit. 
  
8.[ADDRESS_1019737] a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to that product. Worsening of the pterygium is not an AE, unless the lesion growth is greater than expected. 
Treatment-emergent AEs are any AEs with an onset date equal to or after the date of the first 
insertion of the study lens and during the treatment. A pre-existing event that worsens after the 
first treatment date is considered a treatment-emergent event. 
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a 
life-threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important 
medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80895], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. See Section 8.3.6  for procedures for reporting an SAE. 
8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT
For AEs not included in the protocol-defined grading system, the following guidelines will be 
used to describe severity.  
•Mild:  Event requires minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s 
daily activities 
•Moderate:  Event results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning 
29
LL-BMT10001                                                                            CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2 
Leo Lens Technology Co., Inc. 21 December 2020•Severe:  Event interrupts a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or 
incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious” 
[IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION
A determination will be made of the relationship (if any) between an AE and the study drug. A 
causal relationship is present if a determination is made that there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_745503]/or the lens. 
•Unrelated:  A causal relationship can be excluded and another documented cause of the 
AE is most plausible 
•Unlikely related: A causal relationship is improbable, and another documented cause of 
the AE is most plausible 
•Possibly related: A causal relationship is clinically/biologically plausible and there is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the study drug
•Probably related:   A causal relationship is clinically/biologically highly plausible, there 
is a plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the study 
drug, and there is a reasonable response on withdrawal 
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND 
FOLLOW-UP 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the patient is screened will be considered as medical history and not reported as an AE. However, if the study patient’s condition deteriorates at any time after enrollment, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The investigator or qualified designee will record all reportable events with start dates occurring 
any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 days (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for 
SAEs) after the last day of study participation. Patient will be told to call and notify the 
investigator of such events that occur during this period after the end of study visit. Events will 
be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 
AEs will be monitored throughout the study beginning at the time the patient signs the informed 
consent for this study. At each post-Baseline visit, the investigator will begin by [CONTACT_745504] a general, non-directed question, such as “How have you been 
feeling since the last visit?” Directed questioning and examination will then be done as 
appropriate. All reported AEs will be documented on the appropriate eCRF, including 
seriousness, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, and outcome (including date of 
resolution or stabilization, if AE is not ongoing). If AEs occur, the first concern will be the safety 
of the study patients.  
[ADDRESS_1019738] follow-up data regarding the pregnancy, birth, and status of the child. The Sponsor will 
provide special CRFs for data collection in the case of pregnancy. Follow-up should be 
continued until study close-out at the study center. After close-out, the Sponsor's Safety designee 
will continue to obtain follow-up information. Pregnancy should be recorded as a protocol 
deviation. Pregnancy is not an AE; however, any complication related to pregnancy would be 
considered an AE. 
8.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
Any AE should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
8.3.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
Any SAE occurring during the study period should be immediately (ie, within 24 hours of 
learning of the event) reported to a Trial Runners representative listed on the protocol cover 
page. The SAE is recorded on the appropriate eCRFs. In the event of an early termination within 
8 days after study drug administration, the occurrence of an SAE within 8 weeks from Baseline 
(Day 0) should be reported immediately to Trial Runners personnel. All patients with an SAE 
that is related to study drug must be followed for at least 30 days and the outcomes reported until 
the event is resolved or stabilized. The investigator should supply the Sponsor and the IRB with 
any additional requested information (e.g., autopsy reports and terminal medical reports). 
In the event of an SAE, the investigator must:
•Notify the Trial Runners safety office and the medical monitor immediately by [CONTACT_745505] (see first page of the protocol for the 
SAE fax number). Emergency phone numbers and relevant personnel contacts are below:

•Obtain and maintain in the patient’s files all pertinent medical records, information, and 
medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the 
patient 
•Provide Leo Lens Technology with a complete, written case history (AE report form) 
which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not related to the use of 
the investigational drug 
•Promptly inform the governing IRB of the SAE if it is drug-related. For other SAEs, 
notify the governing IRB as required by [CONTACT_1201], local regulations, and the governing 
health authorities

Leo Lens Technology Co., Inc. 21 December 2020Adverse drug reactions that are both serious and unexpected (suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions) will be subject to expedited reported to the IRB as required by [CONTACT_745506]. Reporting must occur within [ADDRESS_1019739] 
Not applicable. 
8.3.9 REPORTING OF PREGNANCY 
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator will notify Trial Runners 
and the medical monitor immediately after the pregnancy is confirmed and the patient will be exited from the study. The investigator will (1) notify the patient’s physician that the patient was 
being treated with LL-BMT1 or bimatoprost, as appropriate, and (2) follow the progress of the 
pregnancy to term on the patient providing written informed consent for release of this data. The 
investigator should document the outcome of the pregnancy and provide a copy of the 
documentation to Leo Lens Technology. 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to patients or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
all of the following criteria: 
•Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the patient 
population being studied 
•Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]) 
•Suggests that the research places patients or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized 
This definition could include an unanticipated adverse device effect, any serious adverse effect 
on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
32
LL-BMT10001                                                                            CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2 
Leo Lens Technology Co., Inc. 21 December 2020application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of patients (21 CFR 812.3(s)). 
8.4.2 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING 
The investigator will report unanticipated problems or events as outlined in the Safety 
Management Plan. The unanticipated problem report will include the following information: 
•Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, Principal Investigator’s 
name, and the IRB project number 
•A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
•An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an unanticipated problem 
•A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported using 
the following timeline:   
•Unanticipated problems that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to the study 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
•Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB and to the study Sponsor 
within 7 days of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
•All unanticipated problems should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as 
required by [CONTACT_17347]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or 
designee), and the OHRP within 10 days of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator. 
An investigator shall submit to the Sponsor and to the reviewing IRB a report of any 
unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, but in 
no event later than [ADDRESS_1019740] (21 CFR 
812.150(a)(1)). A Sponsor who conducts an evaluation of an unanticipated adverse device effect 
under 812.46(b) shall report the results of such evaluation to the FDA and to all reviewing IRB's 
and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_1019741] as 
FDA requests (21 CFR 812.150(b)(1)).

10%-20% drop-out non-evaluable rate, up to 7 patients (7 study eyes) will be consented to begin 
acclimation screening. Those who are consented but fail acclimation screening will be replaced 
until at least 5 patients successfully complete the acclimation screening. Five patients who pass 
acclimation screening will be enrolled as patients for study treatment.  
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES
The following populations will be analyzed: 
•Safety population: Includes all patients whose eyes are in contact [CONTACT_745507]-BMT1 lenses. 
•Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: Includes all patients who have LL-BMT1 lenses 
successfully inserted. 
•Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population: Includes all patients who have LL-BMT1 
lenses successfully inserted and complete at least 1 on-therapy follow-up assessment; 
only the study eye from each patient will be included in this analysis. 
9.[ADDRESS_1019743] been resolved. Prior to database lock, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be finalized and approved. Final analysis will occur after database lock.  
Wherever appropriate, summary statistics will include the frequency, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum for continuous and ordinal variables, and frequency counts 
and percent for categorical variables. Graphical representations of the results may also be 
provided.  
In general, unless otherwise specified, eyes will be the analytical unit and a formal statistical test 
will only be conducted for exploratory purposes when sample size is deemed appropriate. All 
testing will be two-sided with a 95% confidence level. Due to the small sample size in this study, 
nonparametric approach will be applied. For quantitative variables, within-eye before-and-after 
comparisons will be assessed using one-sample Wilcoxon test. For qualitative variables, Fisher’s 
Exact test will be used.  
9.4.2 SAFETY ANALYSES
Analysis of treatment-emergent AEs will be conducted based on the safety population. Safety endpoints include:

•Concomitant medications 
•Heart rate and blood pressure 
•BCVA 
•IOP  
•Biomicroscopy  
•Conjunctival hyperemia 
Ocular events will be reported on an eye level, while non-ocular events will be on a patient level. 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). For each 
AE reported, the number and percent of patients/eyes will be tabulated based on the preferred 
term and ocular and non-ocular AEs will be reported separately. The tables will be generated by 
[CONTACT_745508]. 
The primary safety endpoint is the AE rate (100 × [number of AEs / number of eyes exposed to 
treatment]). The modified safety set will be used for a sensitivity analysis of the primary safety 
endpoint. 
Secondary safety endpoints : 
•Percent of patients with ≥5-mmHg increase from baseline in IOP at each visit 
•Abnormal slit-lamp biomicroscopy findings at the Baseline, Day 1, and Day 7 Visits 
•Contact [CONTACT_745478] 7 Visit
•Change from baseline in CLDEQ-8 results at the Day 7 Visit
Pre-existing AEs, those identified after enrollment but before treatment with LL-BMT1, will be 
tabulated for all consented patients. 
9.4.3 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The secondary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in IOP at each visit. 
The efficacy analyses will be based on the mITT population and only the study eyes will be used. 
Statistical analyses will be performed using methods described in Section 9.4.1 .
9.4.4 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

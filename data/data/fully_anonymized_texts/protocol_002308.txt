Cerevance Beta, Inc. Compound: 
CVN424 
Title of Protocol:  A Phase II, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-
Controlled, Multicenter Study of CVN424 i n Parkinson’s Disease 
Patients with Motor Fluctuations IND No.: [ADDRESS_203556] No.: Not applicable  
Study Number:  CVN424-2 01 Phase:  2 
Study Design: 
This is a phase 2 study , randomized, doub le-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of oral CVN424 at two dose levels (low-
dose 50 mg, high-dose 150 mg) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with motor fluctuations. The over all study design is depi[INVESTIGATOR_174324]: 
 
Approximately 135 male and female subjects with Parkinson’s disease, on a stable dos age of levodopa but with an average of ≥ 2 
h total OFF time/day and not less than 1 h per day , will be enrolled. Following baseline safety and efficacy assessments, subjects 
will be randomized to receive once-daily doses of either low-dose CVN424, high -dose CVN424, or matching placebo . The 
planned low-dose and high-dose levels will be 50 and 150 mg CVN424 per day, respectively. All subjects not randomize d to 
placebo will initiate treatment with 50 mg CVN424 on Day 1; the low-dose arm wi ll continue to receive 50 mg per day, while the 
high-dose arm will increase their daily dosage to 150 mg CVN424 beginn ing on Day 8 ±2 days and continuing thereafter . 
Investigator or their delegate will manage incident AEs according to their m edical judgment. Study drug will be self-
administered each morning as an oral suspension. Subjects will continue th eir other PD medications. 
Subjects will follow the study schedule presented below. Dosing on Day 1, Da y 8, and Day 22 visits will be observed at the study 
site by [CONTACT_174349]. For Visit D ays 8 and 22 , dosing of study drug (but not subjects’ other medications) will be 
deferred until after collection of a blood sample for determination of the study drug “trough” concentration.

(a) Screening activities must occur within 28 days of randomization, but m ay be completed in fewer than 28 days. 
Screening days are nominally called Day -28 to Day -1 but will not nece ssarily correspond numerically to the calendar 
days prior to the Baseline Visit. By [CONTACT_174350], the Patient Motor Diar y will be recorded at home over 2 
consecutive days during screening, but not necessarily on the 2 day s immediately prior to the Baseline visit. 
(b) Study drug supply will be dispensed (as suspension in amber colored bottles) on Day [ADDRESS_203557] ug will be self-administered each morning as an 
oral suspension. For Visit D ays 8 and 22, dosing of study drug (but not subject s’ other medications) will be deferred 
until after collection of a blood sample for determination of the study drug “troug h” concentration.  
(c) Subjects who have abnormal, clinically significant (CS) findings at the Final Study Visit may be asked to return to th e 
clinic subsequently to ensure appropriate safety follow- up. 
(d) By [CONTACT_559], Day [ADDRESS_203558] day of treatment. It will not necessar ily occur on the calendar day following the 
baseline and randomization visit. 
 
Follow-up assessments will occur approximately 7 days after the final (Day 27 ±1 day) dose. 
 
Study committees: 
None. ( Review of incident and cumulative safety data and findings is the respon sibility of the Medical Monitor and sponsor’s 
Responsible Medical Officer.) 
 
Safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]: 
If any of the following occur, the Medical Monitor and Sponsor’s Res ponsible Medical Officer will review the relevant data, 
including unblinded data if deemed necessary, and decide whether it is saf e to suspend dosing or continue dosing at either th e 
planned or alternative dose levels or decides to prematurely terminate the study: 
1. Four or more subjects receiving CVN424 experience the same type of ser ious or Medically Significant event deemed 
related to study drug. 
2. Three or more subjects receiving CVN424 experience alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) elevations >5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) in the abs ence of a concomitant bilirubin increase 
(see below). 
3. One or more subjects receiving CVN424 experience ALT and/or AST elevations >3  ×ULN in the presence of a total 
bilirubin increase >2 ×ULN or an international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5 withou t findings of cholestasis or other 
alternate etiology to explain the elevations (i.e., “Hy’s Law cases”).  
4. Two or more subjects receiving CVN424 experience ALT and/or AST elevations  >3 ×ULN with the appearance of 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever,  rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%). 
 
Primary Objective: 
To assess the safety and tolerability of CVN424 when administered as daily o ral doses for 28 days, adjunctive to levodopa, in

- Safe ty assessments :  
Safety assessments will include AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs and wei ght, physical examinations, electrocardiogram 
(ECG), Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders (QUIP), and Beck Depression Inventory . AEs will be collected from 
signing of ICF. AEs with onset or exacerbation up until dosing on Day 1 will be scored as pretreatment events (PTEs), and AE s 
that occur from first dosing until [ADDRESS_203565] dose will be captured as a treatment-emergent AE (TEAE). Vital signs will 
be recorded at Screening and at least once at each Study Visit . On Day 1 and Day 8, vital sign assessments will be conducted pre-
dose [within 90 minutes prior to dosing], and at least hourly through  [ADDRESS_203566]-dose. Vital signs will include oral temperature, 
blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_174327] . Triplicate orthostatic vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) will be recorded 1 5 
minutes apart at baseline. Orthostatic vital signs (non-triplicate) will be recorded pre -dose and at [ADDRESS_203567] 5 minutes sup ine and (when orthostatic vital signs are 
specified) again after [ADDRESS_203568] 12-lead ECGs will be recorded in triplicate at Screening and on Visit Days 1, 8, 27, and 35 .  
A description of safety assessments is provided in Section  9.1 and the full Schedule of Study Procedures is provided in Appendix DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04

CONFIDENTIAL A. 
 
- Efficacy assessments: 
Efficacy assessments will include Patient Motor Diary (Hauser diary), Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) , 
Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110], Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Patient Global Impres sion (PGI). 
 
- Determination of CVN424 concentration in plasma :  
Plasma samples will be collected for the determination of concentrations of CVN424 as described in Section  9.1.13 , PK Sample 
Collection. 
PK parameters of CVN424 will be derived from the concentration-time data for evaluable subjects. The following PK parameters 
will be determined from concentrations of CVN424 in plasma: C min at steady state (trough level on Day 22), C max on Day 22, 
time to reach C max on Day 22 (tmax), AUC from time 0 to 6 h (AUC 6), terminal elimination rate constant (λ z), terminal elimination 
half-life (t 1/2z), apparent clearance (CL/F), and apparent volume of distribution (V z/F).  
- Pharmacogenomics: 
One whole blood sample will be collected at Baseline for pharmacogenomic analysis ; this will only be collected once per subject. 
A whole blood sample will be collected at pre-dose and [ADDRESS_203569]-dose on Day 1 for ribonucleic acid (RNA) pharmacogenomic 
analysis. The samples will be stored for no longer than 15 years after completion of the CVN424 study and/or until the drug 
development of CVN424 is no longer actively pursued by [CONTACT_174352]. No samples will be stored for longer 
than permitted by [CONTACT_174353] . “Stored samples” in this 
context are defined as samples that are double coded (the samples are stripped of all per sonal identifying information but a key 
links the samples to the clinical data collected from the sample donor) and are u sed in the analysis of investigational drug or 
related drug. 
The sampling of whole blood for pharmacogenomic and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_174328]; every subject must sign the ICF in 
order to participate in this study. DNA samples can be used to identify mark ers (e.g., potential metabolites, or drug metabolic 
enzyme and transporter polymorphisms) that may contribute to variability in CVN424 PK, pharmacodynamics, or safety. Also, 
since pharmacogenomics is an evolving science, many genes and their fu nctions are not yet fully understood. Future data may 
suggest a role of some of these genes in drug response, which m ay lead to additional hypothesis-generating exploratory research 
and diagnostic development on stored samples. 
 
Endpoints: 
The primary endpoint of this study will be:  
 Percentage of subjects with TEAE related to study drug 
The secondary endpoints will include :  
 Percentages of subjects with abnormal and clinically significant (CS) safety labo ratory test results, ECG test results, or 
vital sign measurements at least once post-dose 
 Change from baseline in 2-day average OFF time at Day 27 as recorded in the Patient Motor Diary over the two days 
prior to each visit 
Additional and Exploratory endpoints will include: 
 Change from baseline in UPDRS Part I at Day 27 
 Change from baseline in UPDRS Part II at Day 27 
 Change from baseline in UPDRS Part III at Day 27  
 Change from baseline in UPDRS Part IV question 32 at Day 27

Safety will be assessed among all subjects who receive at least one dose of stud y drug, classified according to the treatment 
actually received. AEs will be presented in listings, and TEAEs will be summarized  as number of distinct events and the number 
and percentage of subjects experiencing a given class of AE as defined by [CONTACT_3433] e Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Individual results  of laboratory tests (e.g., hematology, chemistry, 
urinalysis, and endocrine) will be listed and observed values and change from baseline will be summarized. Individual results of 
vital signs and weight will be listed and observed values and changes from baselin e will be summarized. Individual results of 
quantitative ECG parameters from the 12-lead safety ECGs will be listed and ob served values and changes from baseline will be 
summarized. All summaries will be performed by [CONTACT_14296], by [CONTACT_174354]424 dose level , and for CVN424 overall. Subgroup analyses 
will assess the influence of selected demographic and disease-related ch aracteristics. Physical exam findings will be presented in 
data listings. 
 
Efficacy: 
Efficacy will be assessed among all subjects who were eligible, randomized, an d received at least one dose of study drug, 
classified according to the treatment actually received. Secondary tests of efficac y will assess subjects who were eligible, 
randomized, and judged compliant with treatment and follow-up as classified p rior to breaking the blind. Serial assessments of 
average daily hours of OFF time as recorded in the Patient Motor Diary over the tw o days prior to each visit will be using mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include fixed terms for treatment, visit, treatment x visit interaction and 
baseline measurement with subject-level unstructured covariance among repea ted measurements. Other covariance structures 
may be used in case the model do not converge using unstructured co variance structure. Additional covariates may be included 
based on review prior to breaking the blind. T he primary estimand of efficacy for each active dose vs. placebo will be t he 
treatment-dependent difference in change from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_203570] for significance at one-tailed p < 0.1 to control the overall type 1 error rate at 20% based on Dunnett ’s 
method for comparing two treatments to the same control. Additional con trasts will be used to test for a dose-dependent effect of 
treatment and to estimate dosage-dependent differences in change from baselin e at all other visits. Additional and exploratory 
efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the same model and using the same estimands. Subgroup analyses will assess the influence 
of selected demographic and disease-related characteristics. 
 
PK Measures: 
Concentrations of CVN424 in plasma will be summarized by [CONTACT_174355] (if possible) over each scheduled 
sampling time using descriptive statistics. Individual plasma concentration data versus time will be presented in a data listing.  
PK parameters of CVN424 will be summarized by [CONTACT_174356] (if po ssible) using descriptive statistics.  
Sample Size Justification:   
The safety and tolerability of single- and repeated (7 daily) administratio n of CVN424, including doses higher than in the present 
study, were previously demonstrated in a study with 64 healthy vo lunteers ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The target sample size of 45 subjects 
per treatment arm (total N= 135) is considered to be sufficient for the preliminary evaluation of CVN424 safety , tolerability and 
efficacy in a PD population. The study will have 90% power to detect at least one in stance of any TEAE with an expected

CONFIDENTIAL 4.0 INTRODUCTION 
4.1 Background 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system 
(CNS) caused by [CONTACT_174358] ( Wichmann, 2011 ). PD afflicts >1 million individuals in the [LOCATION_002] 
of America and >10 million worldwide ( APDA.org, accessed 26 Jan 2018 ), causing cardinal 
symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The financial burden of PD is significant. 
GPR6 is an orphan G-protein coupled receptor that is selectively expressed in the brain, and is a 
nondopaminergic target for the treatment of PD. In the brain, GPR6 is predominantly localized to 
striatopallidal medium spi[INVESTIGATOR_174331] (MSNs) that also express dopamine D2 receptors ( Lein et al. 
2007 ; also Cerevance data on file). GPR6 is a constitutively active G s- coupled receptor that 
functionally opposes the G i-coupled D2 receptor in indirect MSNs. Pharmacological intervention to 
inhibit the GPR6 pathway using an inverse agonist is predicted to exert antiparkinsonian effects by 
[CONTACT_174359] D1-receptor expressing MSNs of the direct (striatonigral) pathway .  
CVN424 is a potent and selective inverse agonist of GPR6. The efficacy of CVN424 has not 
previously been studied in humans, but has been demonstrated in various animal models of PD. It 
was dose-dependently effective as monotherapy in reversing immobility in rats with bilateral 6-
OHDA lesion s. It dose-dependently blocked D2 antagonist induced (indirect pathway dependent) 
catalepsy in rats. Safety studies of CVN424 conducted in rodents, dogs, and monkeys have 
demonstrated minimal toxicity, with the primary dose-limiting effect of body weight loss or reduced 
body weight gain. All toxicity findings demonstrated dose-dependency and reversibility of effects.  
A first- in-humans safety study of CVN424 in 64 healthy volunteers has been completed 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); the study findings are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure. In brief, 
CVN424 was safe and well tolerated when administered to healthy subjects as a single oral dose of 
between 1 mg and 225 mg, or when administered as 7 daily oral doses of between 25 mg and 150 
mg. Study drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported by 2 of 40 subjects (5.0%) overall in the 
single-dose cohorts (feeling hot; headache). Study drug-related AEs were reported by 2 of 24 
subjects (8.3%) overall in the multiple-dose cohorts (dysphagia; chills). With one exception, all AEs 
were mild in severity; dysphagia of moderate severity led to treatment discontinuation in one subject 
after their third daily dose (75 mg). There were no severe or serious AEs, and all AEs had resolved 
by [CONTACT_2054]. Administration of the first dose of CVN424 was associated with an elevation 
in group mean and median body temperature. These changes were detectable at [ADDRESS_203575]-dose (the 
earliest scheduled post-dose assessment), increased further by [ADDRESS_203576] dose of CVN424, not following subsequent doses. No other trends in vital sign measurements DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04

In the healthy volunteer study, CVN424 in suspension was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_174332]; peak plasma concentration was usually attained between [ADDRESS_203577]-dose 
(median 1.5 h). When CVN424 was administered after a meal, the peak plasma concentration was 
delayed and decreased while total exposure was minimally increased compared to the same dose 
level administered under fasted conditions. With repeated once-daily dosing, trough plasma 
concentrations usually reached a steady-state level by [CONTACT_2006] 4, with a terminal elimination half-life of

CONFIDENTIAL 6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION 
6.1 Study Design 
This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of two dose levels 
of oral CVN424 (low-dose 50 mg, high-dose 150 mg) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with 
motor fluctuations. The overall study design is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1 . 
Figure 1. Schematic design of study  
  
Approximately 135 subjects with Parkinson’s disease will be enrolled. Following baseline safety and 
efficacy assessments, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of 3 study arms to receive 
low-dose CVN424, high-dose CVN424 or matching placebo. The planned low-dose and high-dose 
levels will be 50 and 150 mg CVN424 per day, respectively, as shown in Table 3.  
Subjects not randomized to placebo will initiate treatment with 50 mg CVN424 on Day 1. 
Thereafter, the low-dose arm will continue to receive 50 mg per day, while the high-dose cohort will 
increase their dosage to 150 mg CVN424 per day beginning on Day 8 ±[ADDRESS_203581] dose of CVN424 may 
elicit in vital signs (notably, increased temperature and heart rate, which were dose-dependent and 
not clinically significant in a healthy volunteer study). Investigator or their delegate will manage 
incident AEs according to their medical judgment.  
Study drug supply will be dispensed (as suspension in amber colored bottles) on Day 1 and at 
subsequent weekly study visits. Study drug will be self-administered each morning on an outpatient 
basis as an oral suspension. Dosing on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 22 visits will be observed at the study 
site by [CONTACT_174349]. For Visit D ays 8 and 22, dosing of study drug (but not subjects’ 
other medications) will be deferred until after collection of a blood sample for determination of the 
study drug “trough” concentration.

Review of incident and cumulative safety data and findings during study is the responsibility of the

6.2 Justification for Study Design, Dose, and Endpoints 
The study is double-blind and placebo-controlled to avoid subjective bias in the assessment of the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of CVN424.  
The selected dose levels are predicted to achieve potentially therapeutic concentrations of drug 
exposure. The lower dose (50 mg per day) may attain CNS exposure at the low end of the 
therapeutic range, while the higher dose (150 mg per day) is expected to provide a high level of 
GPR6 occupancy in brain tissue even at its steady-state nadir plasma concentration.  DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04
CVN424  
Study No. CVN424-[ADDRESS_203585] of GPR6 (half maximal effective concentration [ EC 50] = 8.5 nM 
to 27 nM) in mice, rats, dogs, and humans. The minimum target for a potentially therapeutic drug 
exposure in plasma and CSF was informed by ( i) plasma concentrations yielding half maximal 
effectiveness (EC 50) in rodent models of PD; ( ii) plasma concentrations yielding 50% receptor 
occupancy (Occ 50) in mouse brain; and ( iii) estimation of the ratio of CVN424 concentration in brain 
(mice) or CSF (monkeys) versus unbound in plasma; and ( iv) the similar % binding of CVN424 to 
plasma proteins in rodents and humans (approximately 2%), which implies a similar proportion 
across these species of unbound drug in plasma available to enter the CNS. CVN424 has high 
cellular membrane permeability and is not a substrate for various transporter proteins (P-
glycoprotein 1 [Pgp], breast cancer resistance protein [BCRP], or organic-anion-transporting 
polypeptide [OATP]), so CNS penetration in humans is expected to be similar to that in nonhuman 
species.  
The EC 50 for influencing motor function in unlesioned rodents ranged from 4 to 13 ng/mL in plasma 
with predicted CNS receptor occupancy (RO) between 39 to 76%. Supporting this prediction, direct 
measurement showed that brain Occ 50 was achieved at plasma concentrations of  6.0±0.9 ng/mL to 
7.4 ± 0.9 ng/mL. However, correcting motor impairments in 6-OHDA lesioned rats required 10-fold 
higher plasma concentrations, likely corresponding to approximately CNS Occ 90.  
Assuming Parkinson’s disease subjects will require a CNS exposure closer to that of 6- OHDA 
lesioned rats than to that of unlesioned rats, the minimum plasma level for a potentially therapeutic 
level of drug exposure is predicted to be between approximately 50 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL, 
corresponding to CSF drug concentrations between 1 ng/mL and 3 ng/mL. Based on observations in 
the phase 1 study, the low-dose in the present study (50 mg) is expected to yield a steady-state 
trough plasma drug concentration of approximately 150 ng/mL, corresponding to the minimum 
potentially therapeutic drug exposure. The high-dose (150 mg) will achieve a higher plasma level, 
and higher CNS RO, to maximize the likelihood of detecting an efficacy signal. 
Importantly, the planned low- and high-dose levels of CVN424 are both within the dose range that 
has been previously shown to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy volunteers. 
In the phase 1 multiple-dosing cohorts, the trough plasma concentration (C min) of CVN424 typi[INVESTIGATOR_174335] 4, so trough sample collection on Visit Days 8 and 22 in the present 
study will adequately measure steady state trough concentrations. The terminal elimination half-life 
of CVN424  is approximately 33 h. Therefore, with dosing ending on Day 28, sample collection on 
Day 35 (i.e., washout over approximately 5 half-lives) will be adequate to document substantial 
elimination of CVN424.  
AEs, physical exams, vital signs and weight, ECG findings, and clinical laboratory results are used 
as safety assessments to determine dose tolerability and dose limiting effects of CVN424. The 
efficacy of CVN424 in symptomatic treatment of PD will be explored using scales and methods that 
are standard in studies of this indication. The plasma PK parameters will further elucidate the 
pharmacology of CVN424 in the intended subject population.  
Samples collected for serum/plasma, DNA  and/or RNA analysis will be used to evaluate markers 
(e.g., DNA polymorphisms; RNA expression profile) that may contribute to variability in CVN424 
PK, pharmacodynamics, efficacy or safety. DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04

If any of the following occur, the Medical Monitor and Sponsor ’s Responsible Medical Officer will 
review the relevant data, including unblinded data if deemed necessary, and decide whether it is safe 
to suspend dosing or continue dosing at either the planned or alternative dose levels or decides to 
prematurely terminate the study: 
1. Four or more subjects receiving CVN424 experience the same type of serious or Medically 
Significant event deemed related to study drug. 
2. Three or more subjects receiving CVN424 experience alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/o r 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations >5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) in the 
absence of a concomitant bilirubin increase. 
3. One or more subjects receiving CVN424 experience ALT and/or AST elevations >3 ×ULN 
in the presence of a total bilirubin increase >2 ×ULN or an international normalized ratio 
(INR) >1.5 without findings of cholestasis or other alternate etiology to explain the 
elevations (i.e. , “Hy’s Law cases”).  
4. Two or more subjects receiving CVN424 experience ALT and/or AST elevations >3 ×ULN 
with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness,

One whole blood sample for DNA isolation and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_174341] (Appendix A) and stored under frozen conditions. In addition, 
whole blood samples will be collected at time points specified in the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Appendix A)  for ribonucleic acid (RNA) pharmacogenomic analysis.  
Specific purposes of this pharmacogenomic study include: 
 Identifying genetic reasons why certain people respond differently to CVN424 
 Finding out more information about how CVN424 works 
 Generating information needed for research, development, and regulatory approval of tests to 
predict response to CVN424 
 Identifying variations in genes related to the biological target of CVN424 
This information may be used, for example, to develop a better understanding of the safety and 
efficacy of CVN424 and other study medications, and for improving the efficiency, design and study 
methods of future research studies. 
The samples will be stored for no longer than 15 years after completion of the CVN424 study and/or 
until the drug development of CVN424 is no longer actively pursued by [CONTACT_174371]. No samples will be stored for longer than permitted by [CONTACT_174372]. “Stored samples” in this context are defined as 
samples that are double coded (the samples are stripped of all personal identifying information but a 
key links the samples to the clinical data collected from the sample donor) and are used in the 
analysis of investigational drug or related drug. 
The sampling of whole blood for pharmacogenomic and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_174328]; every 
subject must sign the ICF in order to participate in this study. Blood serum/plasma, DNA  and/or 
RNA samples can be used to identify markers (e.g., potential metabolites, or drug metabolic enzyme 
and transporter polymorphisms) that may contribute to the variability in CVN424 PK, 
pharmacodynamics, or safety. Also, since pharmacogenomics is an evolving science, many genes 
and their functions are not yet fully understood. Future data may suggest a role of some of these 
genes in drug response, which may lead to additional hypothesis-generating exploratory research and 
diagnostic development on stored samples. 
If necessary and feasible, a second aliquot of blood may be taken if isolation of DNA from the first 
sample was not successful or possible.

9.1.[ADDRESS_203633] is found to be not eligible at 
this visit, the investigator should complete the eCRF screen failure form. 
The primary reason for screen failure is recorded in the eCRF using the following categories: 
 PTE/AE 
 Did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria 
 Significant protocol deviation 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Voluntary withdrawal 
 Study termination 
 Other 
Subject numbers assigned to subjects who fail screening should not be reused.  
If a subject fails screening, but is later successfully re-screened, the data for the subject will be 
entered as if these were two separate subjects. Therefore, the data should be entered as follows: 
1. The screen failure data should be entered as a screen failure subject. 
2. Re-screened subjects should be assigned a new subject number and treated as a stand-alone 
subject. DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04

follow-up. 
9.3.2 Early Termination 
Subjects who discontinue dosing or decide to check out of the study clinic early will be advised to 
allow the Investigator (or authorized designees) to complete early termination assessments for safety 
purposes prior to discharge. The reason for discontinuation must be documented in the source 
document and eCRF.  
For all subjects receiving study medication, the investigator must complete the End of Study eCRF 
page. 
9.4 Biological Sample Retention and Destruction  
In this study, specimens for genome/gene analysis will be collected as described in Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_203648] the 
subjects’ personal information to ensure optimal confidentiality and defined standard processes for 
sample and data collection, storage, analysis, and destruction. 
The sample will be labeled with a unique sample identifier similar to labeling in the main study but 
using a code that is different from the code attached to the health information and other clinical test 
results collected in the study. The sample and data are linked to personal health information with 
code numbers; the samples are stripped of all personal identifying information but a key linking the 
samples to clinical analysis data exists. This link means that the subject may be identified but only 
indirectly. The code numbers will be kept secure by [CONTACT_120089]. 
Subjects who consented and provided a pharmacogenomic sample for DNA and RNA analysis can 
withdraw their consent and request disposal of a stored sample at any time prior to analysis. The 
Investigator will notify the sponsor of any subject who has withdrawn consent for the DNA and 
RNA analysis. DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., a CS abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug whether or not it is 
considered related to the drug. 
9.5.[ADDRESS_203651] finding generally may: 
 Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre-existing condition. (Intermittent 
events for pre-existing conditions underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs) 
 Necessitate therapeutic intervention 
 Require an invasive diagnostic procedure 
 Require discontinuation or a change in dose of study medication or a concomitant medication 
 Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_109307] 
 PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (e.g., a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE 
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms: 
 Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s) 
Laboratory values and ECG findings: 
 Changes in laboratory values or ECG parameters are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if they 
are judged to be CS (i.e., if some action or intervention is required). A laboratory re-test and/or 
continued monitoring of an abnormal value are not considered an intervention. In addition, 
repeated or additional noninvasive testing for verification, evaluation or monitoring of an 
abnormality is not considered an intervention DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04

Protocol v. 4.0 14 July 2021 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (e.g., increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately as a PTE or as an AE 
Pre-existing conditions: 
 Pre-existing conditions (present at the time of signing of the ICF) are considered concurrent 
medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline evaluations (e.g., 
laboratory tests, ECG, X-rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related to study 
procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication of such a 
concurrent condition, the worsening or complication should be recorded appropriately as a PTE 
(worsening or complication occurs before start of study medication) or an AE (worsening or 
complication occurs after start of study medication). Investigators should ensure that the event 
term recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g., “worsening of…”)  
 If a subject has a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_174343] (e.g., asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_4070], serious or 
severe in nature, that is, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condition from Baseline (e.g., “worsening of…”)  
 If a subject has a degenerative concurrent condition (e.g., cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condition should only be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater extent 
to that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condition (e.g., “worsening of…”)  
Worsening of PTEs or AEs: 
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study medication, the worsening or complication should be recorded appropriately as an AE. 
Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g., 
“worsening of…”)  
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in study 
medication, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g., “worsening of…”)  
Changes in severity of AEs /Serious PTEs: 
 If the subject experiences changes in severity of an AE/serious PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum severity recorded 
Preplanned surgeries or procedures: 
 Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of informed 
consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed early 
(e.g., as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition, the worsening of the 
condition should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complications resulting from any 
planned surgery should be reported as AEs DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04

CONFIDENTIAL Elective surgeries or procedures: 
 Elective procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condition 
should not be recorded as PTEs or AEs,but should be documented in the subject’s source 
documents. Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be reported as AEs 
Overdose: 
 Cases of overdose with any medication without manifested side effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the eCRF. Any manifested 
side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF 
9.5.[ADDRESS_203652] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
1. Results in DEATH. 
2. Is LIFE THREATENING. 
 The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was a t risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe 
3. Requires inpatient HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_117495].

reported and followed up in the same manner (see Sections  9.6.2  and 9.7). 
9.5.5 Severity of PTEs and AEs 
The different categories of intensity (severity) are characterized as follows: 
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423]. 
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activ ities.  
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.  
9.5.6 Causality of AEs 
The relationship of each AE to study medication(s) will be assessed using the following categories: 
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of  a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible invo lvement of the drug can be 
argued, although factors other than the drug, such as underlying dis eases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible. 
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration  of a drug 
and/or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underly ing diseases, 
complications, concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments. 
9.5.7 Relationship to Study Procedures 
Relationship (causality) to study procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs. 
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibility that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related. DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_11742]/serious PTE (e.g., vomiting) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of 
consecutive days are intermittent. All other events are continuous. 
9.5.11  Action Concerning Study Medication  
 Drug withdrawn – a study medication is stopped due to the particular AE 
 Dose not changed – the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study medication 
 Unknown – only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken 
 Not Applicable – a study medication was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE 
e.g., the study has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study medication was already 
stopped before the onset of the AE 
9.5.12  Outcome 
 Recovered/Resolved – Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/serious 
PTE 
 Recovering/Resolving – the intensity is lowered by [CONTACT_1734]: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptoms has almost disappeared; the abnormal laboratory value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/serious PTE with the condition remaining “recovering/resolving”  
 Not recovered/not resolved – there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosis, signs/ symptoms or laboratory value on the last day of the observed 
study period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the subject 
died from another cause with the particular AE/serious PTE stat e remaining “Not recovered/not 
resolved”  
 Resolved with sequelae – the subject recovered from an acute AE/serious PTE but was left with 
permanent/significant impairment (e.g., recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with some 
persisting paresis

[IP_ADDRESS]  PTE and AE Reporting 
At each study visit, the investigator or designee will assess whether any subjective AEs have 
occurred. A neutral question, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” may be 
asked. Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. Subjects experiencing 
a serious PTE must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory values have returned to baseline or there is a satisfactory explanation for the change. Non-
serious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study procedure, need not to be followed-up for the 
purposes of the protocol. 
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study medication 
or not, must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory values have returned to baseline or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes 
observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, whether or not

12.1.3  PK Analysis 
The concentration of CVN424 in plasma will be summarized by [CONTACT_174378]. Individual plasma concentration data versus time will be presented 
in a data listing. 
PK parameters of CVN424 will be derived using non-compartmental analysis methods from the 
concentration-time data for all subjects in the PK set. Actual sampling times, rather than scheduled 
sampling times, will be used in all computations involving sampling times. The following PK 
parameters will be determined from concentrations of CVN424 in plasma:  
Symbol/Term Definition 
AUC ∞  Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity , calculated as 
AUC ∞=AUC t+C last/λz, where C last is the last quantifiable concentration. 
AUC 6 Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 6 hours , calculated using the 
linear trapezoidal rule. 
Cmax Maximum observed concentration. 
CL/F Apparent clearance after extravascular administration, calculated as Dose/AUC ∞ after a 
single dose. 
λz Terminal elimination rate constant, calculated as the negative of the slope of the log -linear 
regression of the natural logarithm concentration-time curve during the termin al phase. 
t1/2z Terminal elimination half- life, calculated as ln(2)/λ z. 
tmax Time to reach C max.  
Vz/F Apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase after extravascular  administration, 
calculated as (CL/F)/λ z. 
 
Additional plasma PK parameters may be calculated, including analyses by [CONTACT_547] (if possible). 
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) will be used to 
summarize most plasma (PK) parameters for CVN424. Geometric mean and coefficient of variation 
will be computed for right-skewed measures, e.g., C max and AUCs. Plots of C max and AUCs versus 
doses will be generated. 
Pharmacodynamic analyses will investigate the possible relationship between CVN424 PK 
parameters and efficacy and safety outcomes. Population analysis of results may be considered.

12.3 Determination of Sample Size 
The safety and tolerability of single- and repeated (7 daily) administration of CVN424, including 
doses higher than in the present study, were previously demonstrated in a study with 64 healthy 
volunteers. The target sample size of 45 subjects per treatment arm (total N=135 ) is considered to be 
sufficient for the preliminary evaluation of CVN424 safety, tolerability, and efficacy in a PD 
population. The study will have 90% power to detect at least one instance of any TEAE with an 
expected incidence of 0.[ADDRESS_203668] an 80% probability of declaring 
neither dosage of CVN424 significantly better than placebo at reducing OFF time based on the one-

(a) Initial Screening items, to be completed prior to other Screening assessments.  Screening activities must occur within 
28 days of randomization,but may be completed in fewer than 28 days.  Screening days are nominally called Day - 28 
to Day -1,but will not necessarily correspond numerically to the calendar day s prior to the Baseline Visit. By [CONTACT_174392], the Patient Motor Diary will be recorded at home over 2 consec utive days during screening, but 
not necessarily on the 2 days immediately prior to the Baseline visit (Day 0) . 
(b) Vital signs (oral temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heart rate, and blood pressure) and weight will be recorded at Screening, 
Baseline, Day 1 , and at subsequent Study Visits . On Day 1 and Day 8, the assessments will be conducted pre-dose 
[within 90 minutes prior to dosing], and at least hourly through [ADDRESS_203684]-dose. Triplicate orthostatic vital signs 
(blood pressure and heart rate) will be recorded 15 minutes apart at baseline. Ortho static vital signs (non-triplicate) 
will be recorded pre-dose and at [ADDRESS_203685] 
5 minutes supi[INVESTIGATOR_174347] 2 minutes after standing at each scheduled o rthostatic timepoint. 
(c) Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, an d endocrine) will be collected at Screening, 
Baseline, Day 8, Day 27, Day 35, and Early Termination (if applicable) vis its. Urine hCG pregnancy test will be 
performed on female subjects of childbearing potential on Day 1 prior to  dosing. 
(d) Screening laboratory testing will include all items included under ‘Clinical Laboratory Tests” p lus urine drug & 
cotinine screen, and for female subjects a serum pregnancy test (hCG).  An FSH level will be obtained on post-
menopausal women (defined as continuous amenorrhea of at least 2 years  and not surgically sterile). One additional 
tube for plasma and one for serum will be collected for archiving (frozen  storage) to support potential post hoc 
laboratory testing .  
(e) Subjects will receive standardized instruction in how to complete the Patient Motor Diar y (Hauser diary). After 
training, subjects who have passed initial Screening procedures will complete P atient Motor Diary entries for [ADDRESS_203686] one ON and one OFF period; the test sess ion will extend for up to 
[ADDRESS_203687] one in each state. Concordance mus t be within 75% for subject 
eligibility.  
Following a successful concordance test and prior to randomization, subjec ts must complete the Patient Motor Diary 
at home over [ADDRESS_203688] 2 h and not one day below 1.0 h. 
In advance of Study Visits on Day 15 and 27, subjects will complete Diary entries recording their capabilities, 
limitations and motor symptoms over the prior 2 days (e.g., Days 13 and 14, or Days 25 and 26). 
(f) Triplicate standard 12-lead ECG will be recorded at Screening and on Days 1 and  8 pre-dose [within 1 h prior to 
dosing] and 3 h (+/- 15 minutes) post-dose. Triplicate standard 12-lead ECG will also be r ecorded at screening and 
on Day 27, Day 35 and Early Termination (if applicable). 
(g) Upon randomization, the first dose of study drug will be administered un der direction of site personnel. Near the 
conclusion of the Day 1 visit and subsequent weekly visits, subjects  will be given a supply of study drug (as 
suspension in amber colored bottles) to be taken home and stored under refrigeration until use. Study drug will be 
self-administered each morning on days 2-28. However, for scheduled Study Visits on or around day 22, dosing 
must be deferred until after collection of a blood sample for determination of the study drug “troug h” concentration.  
(h) One blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenomic analysis at baseline; this w ill only be collected once per DocuSign Envelope ID: 60D3AE98-BF85-48EC-B406-FBD641E2AD04

Study No. CVN424-[ADDRESS_203689]. 
(i) A whole blood sample will be collected pre-dose and [ADDRESS_203690]-dose on Day 1 for RNA pharmacogenomic analysis.  
(j) Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected at timepoints indicated in  Table 5 . 
(k) At Day 8 visit, one additional tube of blood plasma will be collected for archiving (frozen storage) to support 
potential post hoc laboratory testing (e.g., biomarkers, potential characterization of unknown CVN424 metabolites). 
(l) PTEs will be collected from signing of informed consent up until dosing on Day 1. 
(m) Any AE with onset or exacerbation after dosing on Day 1 will be captured as an A E.

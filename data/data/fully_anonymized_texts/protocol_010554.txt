Title  A Randomized, Open label, Cross -over Feasibility Study for Heparin -free 
Hemodialysis with the Dialyzer with EndexoTM in End -Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) 
Subjects  
Protocol Number  Endexo- [ADDRESS_454234] (IP)  Dialyzer with Endexo, Fresenius Medical Care North America  
Proposed 
Indication  The dialyzer with Endexo used with either the CombiSet® bloodline1 or the Streamline® 
bloodline2, and Citrasate® dialysate are intended for heparin- free hemodialysis 
treatments of patients with acute or chronic renal failure when conservative therapy is judged to be inadequate.  
The dialyzers with Endexo must be used in conjunction with dialysis machines 
equipped wi th ultrafiltration control and are to be used only as directed by a physician.

Study Objective(s)  The primary objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of heparin- free 
hemodialysis (HFHD) with two extracorporeal dialysis circuits (A, B) in ESRD 
subjects maintained on conventional hemodialysis (HD) with Citrasate dialysate and 
regularly pres cribed heparin. 
Circuit (A): dialyzer with Endexo and CombiSet bloodline  
Circuit (B): dialyzer with Endexo and Streamline bloodline  
 
The secondary objective is to collect and summarize adverse events with both dialysis 
circuits.  
Study Design  This is a randomized, open- label, cross -over study with subjects on thrice -weekly (in-
center) hemodialysis. The study consists of a Screening Period, two Study Periods (1 
and 2), a Washout Period and a Follow -up Visit. A study design diagram is presented i n 
Appendix I. 
After screening, chronic kidney disease subjects on thrice weekly conventional HD with 
Optiflux dialyzer (F160NR and F180NR), standard of care (SOC) bloodline, Citrasate 
dialysate, and regularly prescribed heparin dose will be assigned random ly to one of the 
treatment sequences: AB or BA.  
• Circuit (A) includes the dialyzer with Endexo and the CombiSet bloodline.  
• Circuit (B) includes dialyzer with Endexo and the Streamline bloodline  
Each sequence includes two study periods (Period 1 and Period 2 ) and a Washout 
period.  
• Period [ADDRESS_454235] of 5 HD sessions per period (5 Visits per period): 
The 1st HD session with the regularly prescribed Heparin dose, the 2nd HD

Safety 
Monitoring/Safety 
Oversight  All adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) reg ardless of relatedness to 
the Investigational Product (IP) will be captured from the time the subject signs the ICF 
until the subject completes or withdraws from the study. 
The site investigator must inform the Sponsor of every SAE, within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the occurrence.  
The study medical monitor will evaluate and monitor safety of the subjects during the study.  
If the Sponsor determines that an unanticipated adverse event or serious adverse event 
presents an unreasonable risk to the subjects, the Sponsor will terminate the study as 
soon as possible.

During Period 1 and 2, an investigator or designee is to perform thrombus scoring on dialyzer 
arterial and venous end caps, and bloodline drip chambers and pods at the end of 
dialyzer/bloodline use. All observers will be trained on the scoring prior to study start. The same 
observer should perform the evaluations as much as possible throughout the study. After use, the 
observer is to select one of the 4 possible grades as described in the tables below (The pi[INVESTIGATOR_364434]. The observer must assign the grade based on the description, not the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]).  
The following areas of the circuits need t o be scored:  
Dialyzer with Endexo: 1) arterial end cap and 2) venous end cap  
CombiSet bloodline: 1) arterial chamber and 2) venous chamber  
Streamline bloodline: 1) venous Chamber, 2) arterial pod and 3) venous pod 
 
a) Dialyzer arterial and venous end cap s 
Thrombus scoring is to be performed at the end of dialyzer use for every dialyzer used in the study. 
Visual inspections of the dialyzer arterial  and venous  end cap s will be done after the rinseback process 
has been completed by [CONTACT_49885]. This graded scoring method has been adopted from Dorsch et al.2 
and Laville et al.3 
 
Grade 1  Grade 2  Grade 3  Grade 4  
Good, clear dialyzer; no 
detectable clotting  Overall light redness; 
minimal clot formation Overall moderate 
redness; clot formation 
but nonobstructive and 
dialysis still possible  Complete occlusion of 
the dialyzer rendering 
dialysis impossible

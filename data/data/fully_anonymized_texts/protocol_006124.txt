Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/[ZIP_CODE].1Introduc tion
1.2 Angiosar coma
Soft tissue  sarcomas account f or ~1% of adult ma lignancies. Angiosarcomas 
account for a small proportion of this 1% and arise from e ndoth elial cells [1]. 
Angiosarcomas are most common ly seen on th e face and sc alp of elderly males. 
They have also been described in the setting of chronic lymphe dema and po st- 
radiation.[ 2], [3]. Data from the US Sur veillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_412917] R esults 
registries from 1973- [ADDRESS_520256] cancer [4]. The cumula tive incidence at [ADDRESS_520257] 
cancer diagnosis w as 3.2 per 1,000 f or those who received radiation the rapy and
2.3 pe r 1,000 f or those who did not r eceive radiation the rapy (p=0.001) . Overall 
5-year survival was poor at 27-35%, how ever there was no di fference in survival 
between those who did a nd did not r eceive radiation.
Therapy is primarily surgical, how ever these tumo rs have a propensity for 
recurrence and me tastasis requiring eventual systemic therapy. Few systemic 
therapy options e xist and response rates to e xisting agents are poor. Additiona lly, 
given the rarity of angiosarcomas, studie s in s arcomas have included onl y very 
small numb ers of patients with the angiosarcoma subtype. Most  studie s have 
evaluated dox orubicin ba sed regimens with respon se rates ranging from 17% to 
34%.[5-8]. The collective experience of physicians at Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center reported a response in 8 out of 9 patients treated with pa clitaxel 
either weekly or every three weeks for angiosarcomas of the scalp and face [9]. 
Given the frequent inc orporation of radiation in t he adjuva nt treatment of breast 
cancer, the increasing incidence of breast cancer, we may see more of these 
tumor s arising from blood ve ssels in the future. It is the refore prudent to e valuate 
newer possible therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Evaluation of  paclitaxel in pa tients w ith me tastatic 
angiosarcoma lead to a  74 and 45% PFS at 2 and 4 months r espectively [10].
Preclinical studie s in a ngiosa rcoma tumor mode ls have show n antitumor effects 
of antiangiogenic agents. Primate vascular endothe lial growth factor 121 
(VEGF121) was expressed in an endothe lial cell line . Expression of VEGF121  
resulte d in slow growing endothe lial tumor with histology simila r to that seen in 
angiosarcoma. The endothelial cells w ere then treated with V EGFR-2 tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor SU-1498, w hich resulte d in r educed expression of transcription 
factor ets-1, which is stimula ted by [CONTACT_12270] [11]. Clinic al studie s evaluating agents 
with anti-angiogenic properties, suc h as sorafenib and be vacizumab have shown 
encouraging single agent activity in this  disease [12], [13].
1.2 Study D rug - Pazopanib
Numerous growth factors and cytokine s are involve d in the angiogenic process, 
i.e., the process of new blood ve ssel formation, impor tant in the developme nt and 
progression of malignancy. Among these factors, VEGF has a predomina nt role

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018as a central mediator of tumor-related angiogenesis, and its e xpression ha s been 
show n to be an adverse prognostic factor for a number of solid tumor s [14-16].
Pazopanib, be ing developed by [CONTACT_412947] ([COMPANY_004]) for the treatment of a 
variety of cancers, is a multi-target, sma ll mole cule inhibitor .  It is an orally- 
bioavailable, ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF receptor 
(VEGFR) (-1, -2, and -3), platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFR (-α and
-β), and c-Kit [17].
Clinic al data from mor e than 20 c linical Pha se I, II, and III studie s are presented 
in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) (RR2002/[ZIP_CODE]/10 ). As 
of [ADDRESS_520258] been enrolled in p azopanib 
oncology clinical studie s conduc ted by [CONTACT_412948] l Cancer Institute (NCI). 
Clinic al data indic ate that (a) pazopanib is a bsorbed after oral administr ation, (b) 
the 800 mg daily dosin g regimen is an active monothe rapy dose for subje cts with 
cancer, providin g optim al biolog ic and clinical effects associated with V EGFR 
inhibition, ( c) pazopanib is g enerally well-tolerated at the 800 mg  daily dosing 
regimen, and (d) pazopanib ha s encouraging e fficacy in specific tumor settings 
such as Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) , sarcoma, Non-Small Ce ll Lung Cancer 
(NSCLC), cervical and ovarian cancer.
The most  common a dverse events (AEs) reported for pazopanib monothe rapy to 
date are diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, hypertension, ha ir color changes (hair 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_371]) , anorexia, vomiting , dysgeusia, headache, abdomina l pain, rash, 
aspartate aminotr ansferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increases, 
constipa tion, c ough, and arthralgia. Most of these events w ere Grade 1 or 2 using 
the Nationa l Cancer Institute-Common T oxicity Criteria of Adverse Events, 
Version 3.0 ( NCI-CTCAE v3.0) . The most f requent Grade [ADDRESS_520259] and A LT increases. Less common AEs 
of note include hand-foot syndrome, mucositis/sto matitis, pr oteinuria, venous 
thrombotic  events, a nd bl eeding. Intestina l perforations a nd arterial thromboses 
were uncommon.
A review of serious a dverse events (SAEs) across oncology studie s revealed tha t 
the most  frequently reported SAEs (≥ 50 e vents), regardless of causality and 
treatment regimen, as of [ADDRESS_520260] increased, na usea, pleural effusion, 
hypertension, a nd pulm onary embolism. A numbe r of these events are known 
class effects of VEGF inhibitor s.

Cardiac and vascular events w ere categorized as follow s: 
non-vascular cardiac events inc luded arrhythmia s and 
cardiac dysfunction while vascular events inc luded arterial 
thrombotic  events (myocardial infarction/isc hemia, cerebral 
vascular accident and transient isc hemic attack [TIA]) and 
venous thr ombotic events (deep vein thr ombosis, 
pulmona ry embolus) .
In VEG105192,  the overall inc idence rate of cardiac and 
vascular events w as higher in the  pazopanib a rm compa red 
with pla cebo (10% versus 6% ).  A compr ehensive analysis 
of exposur e-adjust ed inc idence rates of cardiac and

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018publishe d in 2009 [ 19]. Treatment response data are available for 138 
subje cts who received pazopanib 800 mg once daily. Ninety-nine percent 
of subje cts had received prior chemothe rapy: 35 s ubjects (25%) had 
received the rapy in a (neo)-adjuva nt setting, 83 ( 59%) had received 
therapy in an advanced setting, and 22 ( 16%) had received both.
The primary endpoint w as the progression- free rate, using  Response 
Evaluation C riteria in Solid  Tumor s (RECIST) at 12 w eeks after start of 
treatment. Pa tients with le iomyosarcoma, synovia l sarcoma and “the other 
types of sarcoma” strata receiving pazopanib in V EG20002  experienced a 
12 w eek progression f ree rate of ≥ 40% , the pre-defined threshold 
indic ating anti-tumor activity. The liposa rcoma stratum did not m eet its 
prespecified endpoint a t the end of stage 1 and did not pr ogress to sta ge 2. 
Based on th e results of the VEG20002, a Phase III randomi zed, double 
blind, pla cebo controlled study (VEG110727) of pazopanib versus placebo 
in subj ects with sof t tissu e sarcoma (study excluded patients w ith G IST or 
liposa rcoma) was initia ted in 2008. V EG110727 ha s comple ted patient 
enrollme nt and da ta are expected in 2011.
1.3Study Rationale
Pazopanib ha s show n encouraging activity in a previous pha se II trial in c ertain 
sarcoma subtypes. In the phase II trial of pazopanib as described above ,  
condu cted by [CONTACT_51222], the progression f ree rate at 12 w eeks exceeded 40% for 
patients w ith leiomyosarcomas, synovial cell sarcomas, and othe r eligible 
sarcomas, but not lipos arcomas. In the group o f other sarcomas, five were 
described as vascular sarcomas.
We hypothe size that pazopanib w ill ha ve therapeutic activity in angiosarcoma 
because they are derived from e ndothe lial cells[1], and pa zopanib is a n anti- 
angiogenic agent. In addition, a gents w ith anti-angiogenic properties have shown 
single agent activity in this dise ase. Sor afenib has been show n to ha ve a 14% 
response rate in angiosarcomas in pr eviousl y treated patients in the phase II 
setting[12]. Bevacizumab has demonstr ated a 12% response  rate [13]. Given the 
limite d data on the  activity of pazopanib in a ngiosarcomas, we propose to 
evaluate its activity in pa tients with angiosarcoma.
1.4Correlative Testing
Pazopanib is  believed to f unction a s an anti-angiogenic agent given its a ctivity 
against the VEGFR 1-[ADDRESS_520286] an early

[IP_ADDRESS] The  Effects of Pazopanib  on Other Drugs
In vitro data indic ate that pazopanib is a potential inhibitor  for 
CYP3A4, CY P2C8, CY P2D6, CY P1A2, CYP2C9 , CYP2C19,
CYP2A6, CY P2B6, and CY P2E1.  Pregnane X receptor transient 
transfection a ssay suggested some potential for human CY P3A4 
induc tion a t high concentrations. Results f rom dr ug-drug 
interaction studie s condu cted in subje cts with cancer suggest tha t 
pazopanib is a  weak inhi bitor of CYP3A4, CY P2C8,  and CY P2D6 
in vivo, but ha d no c linically relevant effect on CY P1A2, CY P2C9 
or CYP2C19  metabolis m. Therefore, concomita nt use of 
pazopanib w ith certain medications ( subst rates of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, a nd CYP2D6) with a narrow therapeutic window will be 
unde rtaken with C AUTION  due to the  potential for alterations  in 
the pharmacologic effects of these medications or an inc reased risk 
for serious or life threatening adverse events associated with su ch 
medications ( see below) seconda ry to the inhibition  of specific 
CYP enzymes by [CONTACT_107395].  In addition, the potential for drug 
interaction w ith such me dications, a lthoug h diminishe d, ma y

6.4Dose Interruptions/ Modifications for Hepatotoxicity
Recomme ndations f or pazopanib dose interruptions/modif ications in  case of liver- 
related treatment-emergent AEs are provided in T able 6.2. As a general rule, 
since many subje cts are taking multiple concurrent medications, it is c ritical to (a) 
do a thorough evaluation of the subje ct’s concurrent me dications ( ensuring all are 
recorded in the  CRF ), and (b) identify and disc ontinue those with know n 
hepatotox icity and replace with a non-hepatotox ic equivalent for the same 
indic ation if  necessary.  Record alcohol use is recorded on the  histor y and 
physical form in the CRF binde r.  Liver dysfunction must be  fully evaluated even 
if clinical signs and symptoms indic ate progression of liver tumor lesions.  
Imaging studie s must be obtained to doc ument pote ntial progression of 
malignancy.

(Study VEG10003 ). Systemic exposur e to pa zopanib a t steady-state appeared to 
plateau at dose s greater than 800 mg once daily.  Increases in the daily pazopanib 
dose above 800 m g in the fasted state resulte d in a small or no inc rease in mean 
systemic exposur e to pa zopanib.
In the event of pazopanib ove rdose (defined as administr ation of more than the 
protocol-specified dos e), the investigator will contact [CONTACT_412954]. 
Decisions r egarding pazopanib dose  modif ications or interruptions w ill be made 
by [CONTACT_412955] w ith the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_412928].
Following a n ove rdose, additiona l monitor ing of the subject for AEs/SA Es and 
laboratory abnormalities will be conside red. A plasma sample  for 
pharmacokine tic analysis for pazopanib ma y be requested by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a case-by-case basis. This pla sma sample will be collected as 
soon a s possible , but w ithin [ADDRESS_520347] dose of study drug. 
Information regarding the quantity of the excess dose, as well as the duration of

8.0 C orrelative /Special Studies
8.1.Hypot hesis
Pazopanib is  believed to f unction a s an anti-angiogenic agent given its a ctivity 
against the VEGFR 1-[ADDRESS_520348] or MRI. Reliable means of potentially 
predicting this are in de velopme nt, but ha ve not b een studie d systematically. We 
therefore propose to explore the ability of PET imaging with [F-18]RDG-K5 to 
assess angiosarcomas prior to and follow ing ongoing therapy with pa zopanib to 
determine changes in a ngiogenesis as an early marker of response  to pazopanib as 
compa red with [F-18] FDG PET/CT and CT imaging.

8.3.3 Analyt ic plan
The objective of the study is to examine how [F-18] FDG PET/CT as an 
imaging agent may be able to predict efficacy or early response  as 
compa red with CT imaging. Analyses will be made by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yu at Fox 
Chase Cancer Center utilizing individua l lesions with a minimum of one 
lesion per patient up to a maximum of five lesions  per patient. G iven the  
patient popula tion w ith me tastatic disease, it is a nticipated we will be 
analyzing up to 50 le sions.  PET images will be scored using the follow ing 
criteria:
Score = 0 D isease progression (< - 20% ); Defined as the percentage 
change in SU V values in each paired ima ge assessment to be less than a 
negative 20%, when baseline images are compa red to w eek 4 ima ges 
Score = 1 N o response ( 20% to > - 20% ); Defined as the percentage 
change in SU V values in each paired ima ge assessment to be less than 
20% up to g reater than or equal to a negative 20%, when baseline images 
are compared to w eek 4 images
Score = 2 Partial response (> 20% to < 50% ); Defined as the percentage 
change in SU V values in each paired ima ge assessment to be between > 
20% and < 50%, when baseline images are compared to week 4 ima ges 
Score = 3 Suc cessful response (> 50% to <90 %); Defined as the 
percentage change in SU V values in e ach paired ima ge assessme nt to be 
between > 50% and < 90%, when baseline images are compared to w eek 4 
images
Score = 4 C omplete response (> 90% ); Defined as the percentage 
change in SU V values in each paired ima ge assessment to be >90%, when 
baseline images are compared to w eek [ADDRESS_520351] criteria and w ill also doc ument changes in H ouns field units  
utiliz ing the baseline and the week 12 stu dies; if a patient progresses at the 
week 6 ima ging time point,  the week six study will be used.
If a lesion is not de tected on the pre treatment [F-18] FDG PET image
/CT or diagnostic  CT image), the score for the paired ima ge sets will be 
defined as not inte rpretable.
The descriptive statistics will inc lude mean, SD, median, minimum,  and 
maximum  for continuous variables and th e numbe rs and pe rcentages for 
categorical variables. The statistic al test will be two sid ed at the 0.05 le vel 
of significance with 95% confidence limit. T he score of each variable will 
be calculated as an average of the lesion le vel score for each patient.

paired t-test will be used to evaluate the mean changes among pre- 
treatment, the  subse quent imaging test, and 95%  confidence internal for 
the changes in pr imary endpoints w ill be  presented.
The change in ima ges (i.e., [ [F-18]FDG PET SUV or Diagnostic CT 
tumor size changes) will be compute d as the baseline value (pre-treatment) 
minus the appropriate post baseline (after mid-treatment) value. Cha nges 
from p re-treatment va lues in SU Vs and ta rget-to-background r atios, a nd 
qualitative scores for change in lesion upta ke at each of the time-points  
will be explored for their ability to predict patient response to therapy.
The change in ima ges (i.e.,  [F-18]FDG PET SUV or Diagnostic CT tumor 
size changes) will be  computed as the baseline value (pre-treatment) minus  
the on treatment va lue. Cha nges from pr e-treatment va lues in SUVs and 
target-to-background ratios, a nd qua litative scores for change in lesion 
uptake will be explored for their ability to predict patient response to 
treatment.
The statistic for determining the correlation be tween the  [F-18] FDG 
PET/CT and othe r imaging moda lities is the  Pearson's correlation 
coefficient. If the assumption of normality does not hold, th en Spearman's 
rank correlation c oefficient will be compute d. Pearson's correlation 
coefficients and the  corresponding 2-sided 90%  confidence intervals will 
be compute d for the change in [F-18] FDG PET/CT and the change in 
Diagnostic  CT from ba seline to on tr eatment ima ging (4 week/ [ADDRESS_520352] respectively). If the lower bound  of the confidence 
interval is >0.4, the n it w ill be concluded tha t the given pair of SUVs are 
correlated. In addition  to Pearson's correlation c oefficient, graphical 
displa ys of the data will be provide d. All othe r seconda ry and exploratory 
correlations  will be  analyzed in the same manner as the primary 
correlations
FDG-PET While FDG-PET response assessme nts need additiona l stud y, 
it is som etimes reasonable to inc orporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to 
comple ment CT scanning in assessment of progression ( particularly 
possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the follow ing algorithm:
a.Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow - 
up is a  sign of PD based on a new lesion.
b.No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG-PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this  is PD . If the positive FDG-PET at 
follow -up is  not c onfirmed as a new site of disease on CT , addition al 
follow -up CT  scans are needed to de termine if there is truly 
progression o ccurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018date of the initia l abnormal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive  FDG- 
PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT  
that is not  progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is 
not PD .
c.FDG-PET may be used to upg rade a response to a CR in a manner 
simila r to a biops y in cases where a residua l radiographic 
abnormality is thou ght to r epresent fibrosis or scarring. The use of 
FDG-PET in this c ircumstance will be prospectively described in the 
protocol and suppor ted by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical literature for the 
indic ation.  H owever, it must be acknow ledged that both  approaches 
may lead to f alse positive CR due to limita tions of FDG-PET and 
biops y resolution/se nsitivit y.

10.1 Adverse Event
10.2 Definitions
10.2.1 Adverse Events (AE)
An Adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and un intended sig n (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding ), symptom or disease tempor ally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) produc t, treatment 
or procedure regardless of whether it is c onside red related to the medical 
treatment or procedure (NCI CTEP Guidelines March 28, 2011 )
10.2.2 Serious A dverse Event (SAE)
Serious A dverse Event (SAE) is an AE that is fatal or life threatening, 
requires inpa tient hospit alization or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916] ( for > 24 hou rs), persistent or significant incapacity or 
substa ntial disr uption of the ability to condu ct normal life functions,  or is a 
congenital anoma ly/ birth defect, or results in a ny impor tant medical event 
that may not result in de ath, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_412929] E when, ba sed upon appropriate medical 
judgment, m ay jeopardize the subje ct and ma y require medical or surgical 
intervention to pr event any of the above  outcomes. A “life-threatening” 
adverse event pla ces the patient at imm ediate risk of death in the judgment 
of the investiga tor or sponsor.
10.2.3 Severity Rating
The investigator will evaluate the severity of each adverse event. NCI 
Common T erminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4.0) or 
study specific toxicity tables provide d in the protocol de fine severity.  If 
not inc luded in CT CAE v.4.0,  severity is expressed in numerical grade 
using the follow ing definitions:
•Grade 1: Mild- asympto matic or mild s ymptoms; c linical or diagnostic 
observations onl y; inte rvention  not indic ated.
•Grade 2: Mode rate-minima l, loc al or noninva sive intervention 
indic ated; limiting age appropriate instrumental ADL.
•Grade 3: Se vere-severe or medically significant but not  imme diately 
life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_412930]; disa bling ; limiting self care ADL.

10.2.5 Expectedness
An Expected Adverse Event is one where the specificity or severity is 
consiste nt with the current inf ormation a vailable from the resources.
An Unexpected Adverse Event is one where the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is related to pa rticipation in  the research is not 
consiste nt with either:
1.The know n or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the 
procedures involv ed in the research that are described in (a) the 
protocol-related doc uments, suc h as the IRB-approved research 
protocol, any applic able investigator brochure, and the current IRB- 
approved informed consent doc ument, and (b) other relevant sour ces 
of information, su ch as produc t labeling and pa ckage inserts: or
2.The expected natural progression of any unde rlying disease, 
disor der, or condition  of the subje ct (s) experiencing the adverse 
event and the  subje cts(s) predisposing  risk factor profile for the 
adverse event.

Response Evaluat ion Criteria in Solid Tum ors (RECIST)
The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumor s (RECIST 1.1) criteria will be used for 
objective tumor response assessme nt. Assessme nts will be performed after every two 
cycles of treatments. Once protocol treatment has been comple ted subjects will be assessed 
every three months or soon er as indi cated and judge d by [CONTACT_44375].

below. (Note: Patients who exhibit obje ctive disease progression  prior to the end 
of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response . Patients who ha ve lesions pr esent at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not me et the definitions of measurable disease, 
have received at least on e cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- 
evaluated will be conside red evaluable for non-target disease. The respons e 
assessme nt is ba sed on th e presence, absence, or unequivoc al progression of the 
lesions.

decimal fractions of centime ters).
Note:  Tumor lesions  that are situated in a  previously irradiated area might or 
might not  be conside red measurable.  Sarcomas arising in a previousl y irradiated 
site will be conside red measurable. Sarcoma lesions tha t have been treated with 
therapeutic intent will be conside red me asurable if they have increased in size by 
[CONTACT_726] 20% .
Malignant lymph node s.  To be conside red pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph nod e must be >[ADDRESS_520379] 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recomme nded to be no greater than 5 mm) .  At 
baseline and in f ollow -up, only the short axis will be  measured and follow ed.
11-042
Copyright©2011 Fox Chase Cancer Center® Ex tramural Research Program (ERP). All rights reserved.
Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018Non-measurable disease.  All othe r lesions  (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions ( longest dia meter <10 mm or patholog ical lymph node s with ≥ 10 to  <15 
mm sho rt axis), are conside red non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions,  
leptome ningeal dise ase, ascites, ple ural/pericardial effusions, l ympha ngitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflamma tory breast dise ase, and abdomina l masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]), are consid ered as non- measurable.
Note: Cystic lesions  that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts will not be consid ered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- 
measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be conside red as 
measurable lesions, if  they meet the definition o f measurability described above . 
However, if non-cystic lesions a re present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection a s target lesions.
Target lesions. All me asurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions  per organ 
and 5 lesions in tota l, representative of all involve d organs, will be identified as 
target lesions a nd recorded and me asured at baseline.  Target lesions w ill be 
selected on the  basis of their size (lesions  with the longest dia meter), be 
representative of all involve d organs, but in a ddition should be those that lend 
themselves to r eproducible repeated me asurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion doe s not le nd itse lf to reproduc ible measurement in 
which circumst ance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproduc ibly 
will be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longe st for non-noda l lesions, s hort axis 
for noda l lesions) for all target lesions w ill be  calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum dia meters.  If lymph nod es are to be included in the sum, the n onl y 
the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum dia meters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the  measurable 
dime nsion  of the disease.
Non-target lesions.  A ll other lesions  (or sites of disease) includin g any 
measurable lesions ove r and above the 5 target lesions will be identified as non- 
target lesions a nd w ill also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these 
lesions a re not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases une quivocal 
progression of each will be noted throughout f ollow -up.
11.4 Methods f or Evaluat ion of Measur able Disease
All me asurements will be  taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations  will be performed as closely as possible  to the 
beginnin g of treatment and ne ver more than 4 w eeks be fore the beginnin g of the 
treatment.
The same method of assessme nt and the  same technique will be used to 
characterize each ide ntified and reported lesion at baseline and dur ing follow-up.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018Imaging-based evaluation is pr eferred to e valuation b y clinical examination 
unless the lesion(s) being follow ed cannot be imaged but a re assessable by 
[CONTACT_461].
Clinic al lesions   Clini cal lesions w ill onl y be considered me asurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin nodule s and pa lpable lymph node s) and ≥10 mm 
diameter as assessed usin g calipers (e.g., skin nodule s).  In the  case of skin 
lesions, doc umentation by [CONTACT_164943], including a ruler to estima te the 
size of the lesion, is  recommended.
CT and MRI This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption tha t CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_520380] 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum s ize for a measurable lesion will 
be twice the slice thickness.  M RI is also acceptable in certain situ ations ( e.g. for 
body scans).
As with C T, if an MR I is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used will be  optimiz ed for the evaluation of the type and site  of 
disease. Furthermore, as with CT , the moda lity used at follow-up w ill be the 
same as was used at baseline and the lesions  will be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond th e scope of the RECIST guidelines to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, bod y parts, 
and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner will be used and the image 
acquisition pr otocol will be follow ed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body 
scans will be performed with br eath-hold sc anning technique s, if possible .
11.5 Response Criteria 
Evaluat ion o f Target Lesions
Comple te Response (CR):Disappearance of all target lesions.   Any pathologi cal 
lymph node s (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in  short axis to
<10 mm.
Partial Response  (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, ta king a s reference the baseline sum dia meters
Progressive Disease (PD):At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, ta king a s reference the smallest sum on stud y (this inc ludes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on stu dy).  In addition to  the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must  also de monst rate an absolute increase of at least 5 m m. 
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also conside red 
progressions) .
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shr inkage to qua lify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qua lify for PD, taking a s reference the smallest sum dia meters while 
on stud y

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018Evaluat ion o f Non-Target Lesions
Comple te Response (CR):Disappearance of all non -target lesions  and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph node s must be non-pathological 
in siz e (<10 mm shor t axis)
Note:  If tumor markers are initia lly above the upper normal limit,  they must 
normalize for a patient to be conside red in c omple te clinical response .
Non-CR/N on-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion( s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits
Progressive Disease (PD):Appearance of one or more new lesions  and/or 
unequivocal progre ssion  of existing  non-target lesions. Unequivocal progr ession 
should not nor mally trump ta rget lesion sta tus.  It must  be representative of 
overall dise ase status change, not a single lesion inc rease.
Althoug h a clear progression of “non-target” lesions on ly is exceptiona l, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_412933] h circumst ances, and th e 
progression sta tus w ill be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or 
Principal Investiga tor).
Evaluat ion o f Best Overall R esponse
The best ove rall response is the  best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until dise ase progression/ recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded sin ce the treatment sta rted).  The 
patient's best response assignment will de pend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018APPENDIX C
Urine Protein Creatinine  Ratio (UPC)
Clinic al meaning of UPC
There is a good correlation be tween the ratio of protein concentration to  creatinine 
concentration in a random urine sample and the amount  of protein excreted ove r 24 
hours. Creatinine excretion is  fairly consta nt thr oughout the day regardless of changes in 
urine flow rate.
Men excrete 20 m g to 25 mg of creatinine /kg of body weight/da y. 
Women excrete 15 mg to 20 mg of creatinine /kg of body weight/da y.
Normal protein excretion is <100 mg to 150 m g/24 hour s and is simila r for men and 
women.
Calculating U PC
UPC ratio = Urine protein (mg/dL) / Urine creatinine (mg/dL).
UPC ratio ≈ equiva lent to g rams of protein excreted in ur ine over 24 hrs.
Exam ple: Subject has a urine protein = 90 m g/dL and ur ine creatinine = 30 mg/dL. 
UPC ratio= (90 mg /dL) / (30 mg /dL) = 3
The calculated UPC ratio is 3, w hich correlates to roughly 3 g protein excretion in a 
24-hour period.
Units for UPC ratio
Note: To calculate UPC, pr otein and creatinine concentrations must be expressed in the 
same units  (mg/dL, g/L, or μmol/L ). If, for example , protein concentration is expressed in 
mg/dL and creatinine  concentration is e xpressed in μmol/L , conversion of one of the 
concentration va lues is r equired. Conve rsion factors are:
From To Conversion Factor
Conven tional Units: mg/dL SI Units: μmol/L Multiply by 88.4
SI Units: μmol/L Conven tional Units: mg/dL Divide 88.4

Early ide ntification and intervention is critical for the optimal manage ment of 
diarrhea.  A subje ct’s baseline bowel patterns should be  establishe d so that changes in 
patterns while on treatment can be identified. An assessment of frequency, consiste ncy, 
and duration of diarrhea, as well as know ledge of other symptoms suc h as fever, 
crampin g, abdomina l pain, na usea, vomiting , dizziness and thir st should be  taken at 
baseline, permitting identification of patients at high risk of diarrhea. Patients w ill be

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018Manage ment Guidelines
Uncomplicated dia rrhea of CTCAE Grade 1 or 2:
•Hydration:  have subject drink 8 to 10 la rge glasses (approximately 2 lite rs) of clear 
non-caffeinated liquids a day (e.g., broth o r electrolyte-containing sports drinks) .
•If Grade 2 dia rrhea, consider dose reduction of investigationa l products.
•Dietary modif ications: have subje ct stop a ll lactose-containing products and eat 
frequent, sm all me als
•Pharmacologic intervention using loperamide :
•Begin lope ramide at initia l dose of 4 mg follow ed by 2 mg every 4 hour s or after 
every unformed stool.  The recomme nded ma ximum  daily dose of loperamide is 
16 mg /day.
•Continua tion of loperamide is sugg ested until  diarrhea-free for 12 hou rs.
•If mild to mode rate diarrhea persists for more than 24 hour s, administe r 
loperamide  2 mg every 2 hours and pur sue evaluation for other treatable causes.
•If mild to mode rate diarrhea persists after 48 hour s tota l treatment with 
loperamide , disc ontinue  study drug(s) and consid er initiation of  second-line 
agents (lomotil, oc treotide ).
Complicated diar rhea of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or Grade 1 or 2 with 
complicating f eatures requires aggr essive management:
•Subje ct must c all stud y site physician imme diately in response to any event of 
severe diarrhea with or  without c omplic ations a s listed above .
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_412942] y be required for subjects most a t risk for life-threatening 
complic ations.
•Interrupt inve stigationa l produc ts until s ymptoms resolve ; conside r 
reintroduc ing at a reduced dose (discuss w ith [COMPANY_001] Medical 
Monitor or de signee).
•If loperamide has not be en initia ted, be gin lope ramide  usage immediately at an 
initia l dose of 4 mg followed by 2 mg e very 2 hou rs or after every unformed 
stool. T he recomme nded maximum da ily dose of loperamide is 16 m g/day.
•If no impr ovement in se verity after 24-hours of maximal lope ramide dosing , 
subje ct must visit  stud y site and be evaluated:
•For dehydration, use intravenous f luids a s appropriate.
•Antibiotic therapy should be conside red in pa tients, w ho pr esent with si gns and 
symptoms of bacterial diarrhea such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and pr esence of 
fecal leukocytes. Investiga tors should ha ve a low threshold to sta rt such

Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018•Before initia tion of antimi crobial therapy, stool c ultures should be obtained.
When bacterial etiology for diarrhea is suspe cted, study-treatment and anti- 
motilit y agents (loperamide or others) should b e held.
•Intervention w ill be  continued until dia rrhea free for 24 hour s.
Alternative Pharmacologic Intervention for Uncomplicated and C omplicated 
Diarrhea
•Lomotil ( dephenoxylate 2.5 mg + atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 0.025 mg) can be used. The 
recomme nded dos e is 2 t ablets 4 time s daily. When dia rrhea is unde r control, a 
dose reduction w ill be attempted.
•The synthetic octapeptide , octreotide , has been shown to be effective in the 
control of diarrhea induc ed by [CONTACT_153153] -based chemothe rapy regimens 
when administ ered as an escalating dose by [CONTACT_412969]. Octreotide can be administe red at dose s ranging from 
[ADDRESS_520397] anti-nausea/anti-emetic therapy as necessary.
If a subje ct vomits a fter taking study medication, the subje ct will be instructed not  to take 
a replacement dose  on th at same day. The subje ct will resume taking pazopanib a t the 
next scheduled dose on the follow ing day.  If vomiting persists, the n the  subject should 
contact [CONTACT_9682].
To prevent or treat nausea and vomiting standard medications  are recomm ended. 
Depending upon  approved me dications in your region, th ese may include: 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonist ( granisetron, o ndansetron, dola setron m esylate); NK-1 receptor antagonists  
such as aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053],  me toclopramide ,  phe nothia zines (prochlorperazine); corticosteroids, 
(dexamethasones, prednisone); and cannibinoids ( dronabinol) .
WARNING: Ondanse tron  Saf ety.
Ondanse tron (Zofran) IV: Drug Saf ety Communication - QT prolongation 
AUDIENCE: Oncology, Surgery, Gastroenterology
ISSU E: The U.S. Food a nd D rug Administr ation ( FDA) is informing healthcare 
professiona ls and the public that prelimina ry results from a recently comple ted clinical 
study suggest tha t a 32 m g single intravenous dose of onda nsetron (Zofran, onda nsetron 
hydrochloride, and generics) may affect the electrical activity of the heart (QT interval
11-042
72
Copyright©2011 Fox Chase Cancer Center® Ex tramural Research Program (ERP). All rights reserved. 
Amendment 7 Version Date 12/12/2018prolongation), which could pre-dispose patients to develop an abnormal and pot entially 
fatal heart rhythm know n as Torsades de Point es.
There were changes to the  Zofran drug label to remove the 32 mg  single intravenous 
dose. The upda ted label will state that onda nsetron can continue to be used in adults  and 
children with chemothe rapy-induc ed nausea and vomiting at the lo wer intravenous  dose 
recomme nded in the drug label, a dose of 0.15 m g/kg administe red every 4 hou rs for 
three doses; how ever, no sing le intravenous dose should  exceed 16 m g. Information from 
the new clinical study will be included in the upda ted drug label.
BACKGROUND: Zofran (onda nsetron) is in a class of medications c alled 5-HT3 
receptor antagonists.  It is used to pr event na usea and vomiting caused by [CONTACT_412970], radiation therapy and su rgery. FDA will evaluate the final study results 
when available, and w ill work with [COMPANY_001] to explore an alternative single dose 
regimen tha t is both sa fe and effective for the prevention o f chemothe rapy-induc ed 
nausea and vomiting in adults.
RECOMMENDATION: The new information on QT prolonga tion doe s not change any 
of the recomme nded oral dosing regimens for ondansetron.  It also doe s not  change the 
recomme nded low er dose intravenous dosi ng of ondansetron to pr event post- operative 
nausea and vomitin g.
•The use of a single 32 m g intravenous dose of ondansetron should be  avoided.

Introduction 
 
Anti-angiogenic treatment may i mprove efficacy of anticancer im munotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
In recent years, there has been an emergence of anticancer immu notherapi[INVESTIGATOR_453060].1 These adoptive cell immunotherapi [INVESTIGATOR_453061]-infiltrating  lymphocytes 
(TIL), cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, lymphokine-activate d killer (LAK) cells, and tumor-
associated antigen (TAA)-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL).[ADDRESS_577784]. One of the critical cha llenges that adoptive cell immun otherapy faces is the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenviro nment contains a 
vasculature that is structura lly and functionally abnormal. In certain regions of tumors, the 
vessels are leaky, twisted, and la ck stabilizing pericytes and basement membrane. The 
structurally abnormal tumor vessels do not provide nutritive bl ood flow. The immature tumor 
vessels contribute to an abnormal tumor microenvironment with o ne of the key characteristics 
being that of hypoxia.3 Abnormal tumor vasculature and subsequent tumor hypoxia contri bute 
to immune tolerance of tumor cells by [CONTACT_453087] T cells into tumor 
parenchyma and inhibiting their antitumor efficacy.4 These obstacles might explain why the 
promising approach of adoptive cell immunotherapy does not exer t significant antitumor 
activity.5 Hypoxia contributes to immune suppression by [CONTACT_453088] a-inducible factor 
(HIF-1) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathw ay, which plays a determining 
role in promoting tumor cell growth and survival.[ADDRESS_577785] immune suppression phenotypes, such a s myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSC)7, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM)8, and dendritic cells9. 
Adoptive cell immunotherapy alon e is not efficient enough to de crease tumor growth as its 
antitumor effect is inhibited by [CONTACT_453089]. 
Antiangiogenic therapy could normalize tumor vasculature and de crease hypoxic tumor 
area and thus may be an effective modality to potentiate immuno therapy3.  
 
Recent studies have demonstrated that there is an interaction b etween immune response and 
tumor angiogenesis. Huang et al. demonstrated that lower doses of an anti-VEGF receptor 2 
(VEGFR2) antibody treatment enhanced the anti-cancer efficacy o f a vaccine therapy in a 
model of immune tolerant breast cancer.[ADDRESS_577786] tumor v asculature and improved tissue 
distribution of functional vasculature within the tumor. As sta ted earlier, myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSC) and tu mor-associated macrophages (TAM) promote tumor 
progression by [CONTACT_453090]-cancer immunity. Low dos es of this treatment decreased 
the number of MDSCs and increased the number of TAMs. On profil e analysis, however, these 
TAMs were polarized from an imm unosuppressive (M2-like) to an i mmune-stimulatory (M1-
like) phenotype. A low dose of the anti-angiogenic treatment wa s also demonstrated to enhance 
tumor infiltration by [CONTACT_398]4+ and CD8+ T-cells. An improvement in tumor vasculature and 
polarization of TAMs was shown to reduce immune-regulatory sign als, and facilitated 
recruitment of activated CD8 (+)  T cells that could exact an an ti-tumor effect.

The proposed mechanism was a synergistic therapeutic effect in which endostatin contributed 
to structural normalization of tum or vasculature. They also dem onstrated that the addition of 
endostatin augmented homing of t he CIK cells and subsequently intratumoral CD3(+) T 
lymphocytes, suggesting that the addition of an anti-angiogenic  agent normalized vasculature, 
reduced hypoxia, and altered the tumor microenvironment  to enh ance tumor infiltration by 
[CONTACT_453091] T-lymphocytes.    
 
The Programmed Death (PD-1) Receptor, Its Ligand PD-L1, and a N ovel 
Immunotherapy: Anti-PD-1 Antibody The Programmed death 1 (PD-1) r eceptor is expressed on activate d T- and B-cells.
12 Its major 
ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_453062] a subset of macr ophages, but can be induced 
by [CONTACT_47434] a variety of tissue types.13-17 When activated T-cells expressing 
PD-1 encounter PD-L1, T-cell effector functions are diminished.  PD-1 also binds PD-L2 (B7-
DC), which is expressed selectively on macrophages and dendriti c cells.17-[ADDRESS_577788] been shown to express PD-L1 and PD-L 2, 
effectively co-opting a native tolerance mechanism.21-24 It has been postulated that antibodies 
that block the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumors may  preferentially release the 
cytotoxic function of tumor-specific T cells with fewer systema tic toxic effects than those that 
are seen with other immune chec kpoint inhibitors, such as CTLA-41  
Two large, dose-escalation, phase 1 clinical trials evaluating the safety of the anti–PD-1 
antibody nivolumab (formerly known as BMS936558)  and the anti–PD-L1 antibody BMS936559 showed significant ant itumor activity in subjects wit h advanced melanoma, lung 
carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma, among other cancers, thus validating the PD-1–PD-L1 
axis as a therapeutic target.
25-[ADDRESS_577789] clinical responses were durable beyond 1 year.26,27 Toxic 
effects were generally of low grade. Especially relevant to thi s protocol, cumulative response 
rate among subjects with renal cell carcinoma was 27% (9/33 subjects).27  
 Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a highly selective, humanized monocl onal IgG4–kappa isotype 
antibody against PD-1 that is desi gned to block the negative im mune regulatory signaling of 
the PD-1 receptor expressed by T cells.
28 The variable region sequences of a very-high-affinity 
mouse antihuman PD-1 antibody (di ssociation constant, 28 pM) we re grafted into a human 
IgG4 immunoglobulin with a stabilizing S228P Fc alteration. The  IgG4 immunoglobulin 
subtype does not engage Fc receptors or activate complement, th us avoiding cytotoxic effects 
of the antibody when it binds to the T cells that it is intende d to activate. In T-cell activation 
assays that used human donor bl ood cells, the 50% effective con centration was in the range of 
0.[ADDRESS_577790] dose escalation phase 1 study involving subjects wit h solid tumors 
showed that MK-3475 was safe at the dose levels tested (1 mg per kilogram of body weight, 3 
mg per kilogram, and 10 mg per kilogram, administered every 2 w eeks) without reaching a 
maximum tolerated dose. In addi tion, clinical responses were ob served at all the dose levels.[ADDRESS_577791] a high rate of sustained tumor regression with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxicities, and a very low i ncidence of grade 3 or 4 toxic ities.

Page 13 of 70 The dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W of pembrolizumab is planned for all urothelial cancer trials. 
Available PK results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and othe r solid tumor types support 
a lack of meaningful difference in PK exposures obtained at a given dose among tumor types. 
An open-label Phase 1 trial (PN 001) in melanoma subjects is bei ng conducted to evaluate the 
safety and clinical activity of single agent pembrolizumab.  Th e dose escalation portion of this 
trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/ kg, administered every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose l evels were well tolerated and 
no dose-limiting toxicities were ob served.  This first in human  study of pembrolizumab showed 
evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor s ize reduction at a ll dose levels 
(1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No maximum tolerated dose  ( M T D )  h a s  b e e n  
identified. 
 In KEYNOTE-001, two randomized cohort evaluations of melanoma subjects receiving pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have bee n completed.  The clinical 
efficacy and safety data demonstrate a lack of clinically impor tant differences in efficacy 
response or safety profile at these doses.  For example, in Coh ort B2, advanced melanoma 
subjects who had received prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_453063] 2 mg/kg versus 1 0 mg/kg Q3W.  The overall resp onse rate (ORR) was 26% 
(21/81) in the 2mg/kg group and 26 % (25/79) in the 10 mg/kg gro up (full analysis set (FAS)).  
The proportion of subjects with drug-related adverse events (AE s), grade 3-5 drug-related AEs, 
serious drug-related AEs, death or discontinuation due to an AE  was comparable between 
groups or lower in the 10 mg/kg group.    Available pharmacokinetic results in subjects with melanoma, NS CLC, and other solid tumor 
types support a lack of meaningful difference in pharmacokineti c exposures obtained at a given 
dose among tumor types.  Population PK analysis has been perfor med and has confirmed the 
expectation that intrinsic factors do not affect exposure to pe mbrolizumab to a clinically 
meaningful extent.  Taken togeth er, these data support the use of lower doses (with similar 
exposure to 2 mg/kg Q3W) in all solid tumor indications.  2 mg/ kg Q3W is being evaluated in 
NSCLC in PN001, Cohort F30 and PN010, and 200 mg Q3W is being e valuated in head and 
neck cancer in PN012, which are expected to provide additional data supporting the dose 
selection.  Selection of 200 mg as the appropriate dose for a switch to fix ed dosing is based on simulation 
results indicating that 200 mg will provide exposures that are reasonably consistent with those 
obtained with 2 mg/kg dose and importantly will maintain indivi dual patient exposures within 
the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with m aximal clinical response.  A 
population PK model, which chara cterized the influence of body weight and other patient 
covariates on exposure, has been  developed using available data from 476 subjects from 
PN001.    The distribution of e xposures from the 200 mg fixed dose are predicted to considerab ly 
overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose, with some tendenc y for individual values to 
range slightly higher with the 200 mg fixed dose.    T h e  s l i g h t  i n c r e a s e  i n  P K  v a r i a b i l i t y  
predicted for the fixed dose re lative to weight-based dosing is  not expected to be clinically 
important given that the range of individual exposures is well contained within the range of 
exposures shown in the melanoma studies of 2 and 10 mg/kg to pr ovide similar efficacy and 
safety.  The population PK evaluation revealed that there was n o significant impact of tumor 
burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between t he NSCLC and melanoma

types and indication settings.  
 Bevacizumab has gained approval for the treatment of metastatic  renal cell carcinoma, when it 
was combined with Interferon Alfa-2a as reported by [CONTACT_453092]. In the study 649 
patients with previously untreat ed mRCC were randomized to trea tment with either IFN+ 
Bevacizumab or IFN+ Placebo. In t hat study overall response rate (ORR) was 31% vs 13% 
respectively (p<0.001). This was associated with an improvement  in PFS and a trend towards 
improvement in OS. In a similar trial CALGB [ZIP_CODE], 732 previous ly untreated patients were 
also randomized to IFNa + Bevacizumab vs IFNa + placebo. This t rial also showed an 
improvement in ORR of 25.5%  vs 13.1% respectively.   
 
Study Rationale 
There is recent promising evidence that anti-PD-[ADDRESS_577792] contend with a tumor microenvironment that is  immunosuppressant, in part 
because of angiogenesis that results in hypoxia, diminishing the ability of the antibodies to infiltrate the tumor.
3,10,11 One of the front-line treatment s for metastatic RCC is the ant i-
angiogenic agent, bevacizumab.31-33 We hypothesize that through the strategy of adding the 
anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab to the anti-PD-1 agent pembrolizuma b, tumor vasculature can 
be normalized (by [CONTACT_453093] c), thereby [CONTACT_453094] T-lymphocytes. We will conduct two studies base d on this premise. The first 
study is a Phase Ib dose escalation trial to establish the safe dose of pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab for subjects with metastatic clear cell RCC after failure of at least one systemic therapy of the disease. Once that safe dose is determined, we will conduct a 
Phase II study to assess superiority of disease response by [CONTACT_453095]ïve metastatic RCC.

Pre-medication is not required but may be administered per phys ician discretion. 
 
5.3. Drug Administration 
 
5.3.1. Pembrolizumab + Bevacizumab Administration  Phase Ib 
Dosing will occur in 21-day cycles. Pembrolizumab in the Phase Ib dose escalation study 
will be dosed at 200 mg  IV followed by [CONTACT_453100] 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg IV on day 1 of a 21 day cycle.  
 
Phase II 
In Phase II, the pembrolizumab dose will be 200 mg administered  via IV followed by 
[CONTACT_453101] 15mg/kg (dose established in the Phase Ib study)  administered via IV. 
Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30-minute intravenous i nfusion. Bevacizumab will 
be administered as a one-hour i ntravenous infusion. All treatme nt will be administered 15-

begin 1 day earlier or up to 2 days  later to accommodate schedu ling issues. 
 Monitoring 
Vital signs including blood pre ssure, pulse, temperature, respi [INVESTIGATOR_1520], and pulse oximetry, 
will be measured as follows: 
 Pembrolizumab infusion: before and after the infusion and every  30 minutes (±5 min) 
until the bevacizumab infusion is complete.  
 During bevacizumab infusion: eve ry 30 minutes (±5 min) for one hour during infusion.

changes by ≥ 10% during the  course of the study. 
 
5.4. Supportive Care 
Optimal patient care is to  be given to all subjects. 
 Subjects should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusion of blood 
and blood products, treatment with  antibiotics, analgesics, erythropoietin, or bisphosphonates, 
when appropriate.   Although acetaminophen at doses of ≤2 grams/day is permitted, it should be used with caution in subjects with impaired liver function. 
 
Subjects should receive appropr iate supportive care measures as  deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017]. Suggeste d supportive care measures for t he management of adverse 
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these 
guidelines include the use of or al or intravenous treatment wit h corticosteroids as well as 
additional anti-inflammatory age nts if symptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms 
may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorde r, attempts should be made 
to rule out other causes such a s metastatic disease or bacteria l or viral infec tion, which might 
require additional supportive ca re. The treatment guidelines ar e intended to be applied when 
the investigator determines the  events to be related to pembrol izumab. 
 Note: if after the evaluation t he event is determined not to be  related, the inves tigator does not 
need to follow the treatment  guidance (as outlined below).

Management of Pembrolizumab Infusion Related Reactions 
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or  life-threatening infusion-reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms usually dev elop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resol ve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. 
 Table 5 below shows treatment guidelines for subjects who exper ience an infusion reaction 
associated with administration of pembrolizumab.

5.5. Concomitant Medications 
 
Medications or vaccinations speci fically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there  is a clinical indication for  one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically pr ohibited during the trial, disco ntinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required. The investigator should discuss an y questions regarding this 
with the sponsor-investigator by c ontacting the BTCRC Project Manager. The final decision 
on any supportive therapy or vaccina tion rests with the investigator and/or the subject's 
primary physician.  
 Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures All treatments that the investig ator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] w ith the community standards of 
medical care. All concomitant medications will be recorded on t he electronic case report form 
(eCRF).  All concomitant medications recei ved within [ADDRESS_577826] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs 
and ECIs as defined in Section 11.  Myeloid growth factors to treat subjects with neutropenia according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Guidelines are permitted. Myeloid g rowth factors should be 
avoided (if medically appropriate) in Cycle [ADDRESS_577827]’s 
malignancy should be treated at th e discretion of the investiga tor. 
 
Medications with potential CNS effe cts are not prohibited in th is study, but it is recommended 
that their use be minimized to avoid confusion in  the interpret ation of CNS eff ects should they 
occur during the course of treatment with pembrolizumab and bev acizumab.   
 In appropriate settings, such a s combinations with agents known  to produce frequent 
thrombocytopenia, restricted us es of anticoagulants should be c onsidered. 
 All other medical conditions should be treated at the discretio n of the investigator in accordance 
with local community standards of medical care.  The Effects of Other Drugs on Bevacizumab Any drugs or supplements that in terfere with blood clotting can  raise the risk of bleeding during 
treatment with bevacizumab. These drugs include vitamin E, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), 
warfarin (Coumadin), ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] (Ticlid), and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (Pla vix).These agents should be 
used with caution.  Prohibited Concomitant Medications

5.6. Diet/Activity/Other Considerations 
 
Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are  required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. 
Contraception Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Fur thermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm. Non-pregnant, non-
breast-feeding women may be enro lled if they are willing to use  2 methods of birth control or 
are considered highly unlikely to conceive. Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) 
surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the s tudy. The two birth control methods can be either two barrier 
methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent p regnancy. Subjects should 
start using birth control from  study Visit [ADDRESS_577829] dose of study drug.  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contra ception: diaphragm, condom 
(by [CONTACT_3969]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermi cide. Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contrac eptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcuta neous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents). Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication ma y involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the s tudy. In order to participate in 
the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements described above for the duration 
of the study and [ADDRESS_577830]’s status until the pregnancy h as been completed or 
terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to BT CRC Administrative 
Headquarters (AHQ) and to [COMPANY_006] immediately and within 24 hours  if the outcome is a serious 
adverse experience (e.g., deat h, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-
threatening complication to the mother or newborn). The study i nvestigator will make every 
effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to BTCRC AHQ. If a male subject impregnate s his female partner, he 
must immediately inform the site study personnel and the pregna ncy reported to BTCRC AHQ 
and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as  described above and in Section 11.

6. DOSE DELAYS   The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version [ADDRESS_577832] laboratory tests 
before and at regular intervals  during their par ticipation in this study as specified in Section 7. 
 Subjects will be evaluated for a dverse events (all grades), ser ious adverse events, and adverse 
events requiring protocol thera py interruption or discontinuati on at each study visit for the 
duration of their particip ation in the study.   
 Subjects discontinued from the tr eatment phase of the study for  any reason will be evaluated at 
least 30 days (+ 7) after the l ast dose of protocol therapy. 
 
6.1.Start of a New Cycle 
 A new treatment cycle will only b e initiated when all of the fo llowing conditions are met: 
 ANC ≥ 1,500× 109/L  
 platelets ≥ 100× 109/L  
 non-hematologic treatment relate d toxicities have improved to ≤  Grade [ADDRESS_577833]’s 
baseline values (except alopecia) 
 If blood counts are below this threshold, blood work is to be repeated weekly until counts are at an acceptable level. If treatment is unable to restart withi n [ADDRESS_577834] will be per manently discontinued from study therapy.   
 NOTE:  For cycle 1 only, the inabilit y to restart therapy within 2 weeks of the planned date is 
a DLT (per section 5.1.1); however, the subject is allowed an a dditional week of recovery and 
is allowed to remain on study if treatment restarts within 12 w eeks. 
 Any delay to the start of pembrolizumab will result in the same  delay to bevacizumab (and vice 
versa) so that both treatments are given together. Study proced ures associated with each cycle 
of therapy will also be delayed accordingly (including scans for tumor assessment). Blood tests and/or clinical evalu ations should occur at  the discretion of t he treating investigator to monitor 
these parameters. If one drug is permanently discontinued the o ther drug can be continued.

6.4. Dose Modifications  
 
There will be no dose modification of bevacizumab in the Phase Ib study. Once the doses are 
established for the Phase II study, there will be no dose modif ication of bevacizumab. 
 
Pembrolizumab Dose Modifications  
Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) associated with p embrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiol ogy.  These immune-related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly 
after the first dose or several  months after the last dose of p embrolizumab treatment and may 
affect more than on body system simu ltaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation 
of treatment is critical to re duce complications. Based on exis ting clinical study data, most 
irAEs were reversible and could be  managed with interruptions o f pembrolizumab, 
administration of corticosteroid s and/or other supportive care.  For suspected irAEs, ensure 
adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes . Additional procedures or 
tests such as bronchoscopy, endos copy, skin biopsy may be inclu ded as part of the evaluation. 
Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discont inue pembrolizumab and 
administer corticosteroids. Dos e modification and toxicity mana gement guidelines for irAEs 
associated with pembrolizumab are provided in Table 3 below.   Other allowed dose interr uptions for pembrolizumab 
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / sur gical events or logistical 
reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on s tudy therapy within [ADDRESS_577836] Manager. The 
reason for interruption should be  documented in the patient's s tudy record.

8.1. Definitions Associated with Resp onse Evaluation Criteria in Sol id Tumors (RECIST) 
version 1.1 
 
8.1.1. Measurable disease:  The presence of at l east one measurable lesion. If the measurab le 
disease is restricted to a so litary lesion, its neoplastic natu re should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Measurable lesions:  Measurable lesions are defined a s those that can be accurately  
measured in at least one dimen sion (longest diameter to be reco rded) as >[ADDRESS_577843] 
x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_577844] scan, or  >[ADDRESS_577845] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fracti ons of centimeters). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Non-measurable lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of di sease), including small lesion s 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable d isease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, i nflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followe d by [CONTACT_462]), are considere d as non-measurable. 
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet  the criteria for radiographical ly defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as maligna nt lesions (neither measurab le nor non-measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to repre sent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the defin ition of measurability described  above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are prefe rred for selection as target 
lesions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Malignant lymph nodes .  To be considered pathologicall y enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_577846] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Baseline documentation of “Targe t” and “Non-Target” lesions:   
 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a m aximum of 2 lesions per organ  and 5 
lesions in total, representativ e of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at ba seline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions w ith the longest diameter), be rep resentative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be tho se that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the larges t lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next larg est lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be s elected.  A sum of the diamete rs (longest for non-nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal le sions) for all target lesions w ill be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters .  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the su m.  The baseline sum diameters w ill be used as reference to 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-GU14-[ADDRESS_577847] ive tumor regression in the meas urable dimension of the 
disease. 
 Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 targe t lesions should be identifie d as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baselin e.  Measurements of these les ions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in r are cases unequivocal progression  of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up. 
 
8.2. Response Criteria for Target Lesions 
 
8.2.1. Evaluation of target lesions 
Complete Response (CR) Disappear ance of all target lesions.  An y pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the  diameters 
of target lesions, taking as r eference the baseline sum 
diameters
Progressive Disease (PD) At leas t a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as r eference the smallest sum 
on study (this includes the ba seline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more  new lesions is also 
considered pro
gressions).
Stable Disease (SD) Neither su fficient shrink age to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qu alify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on stud y
 
8.2.2. Evaluation of non-target lesions  
Response Criteria Evaluation of non-target lesions 
* Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level 
* Incomplete Response/ Stable Di sease (SD) Persistence of one or more non-
target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits 
* Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new 
lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target 
lesions*
 * Although a clear progression of “n on-target” le sions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3933], and th e progression status should be

disease progression/recurrence (t aking as reference for PD the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment st arted). In general, the subject's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

*In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non-t arget lesions may be

Subjects with a global deteriora tion of health status requiring  discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of dis ease progression at that time should be classified as having  
“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to doc ument the objective 
progression even after dis continuation of treatment. 
 
In some circumstances it may be di fficult to distinguish residu al disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determ ination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be inve stigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/ biopsy) to confirm the complete 
response status. 
 
8.4. Definitions for Response Eval uation –RECIST version 1.[ADDRESS_577849] Documentation of Response: The time between initiation of therapy and first documentation of PR or CR. 
 
8.4.2. Confirmation of Response: To be assigned a status of compl ete or partial response, change s in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_15221].  
8.4.3. Duration of Response: Duration of overall response—the period measured from the time that measurement 
criteria are met for complete or partial response (whichever st atus is recorded first) until 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-GU14-003 Version Date 11OCT2018 
  Confidential  
Page 42 of 70 the date that recurrent or progr essive disease is objectively d ocumented (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements rec orded since treatment 
started). 
 
8.4.4. Duration of Overall Complete Response: The period measured from the time that measurement criteria are met for complete response until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
8.4.5. Response Rate:  The response rate is the proportion of all subjects with confir med PR or CR according to 
RECIST v1.1.  
8.4.6. Clinical Benefit Rate The proportion of patients with a c onfirmed complete response, a partial response or stable 
disease based on RECIST 1.1.  
8.4.7. Progression-Free Survival: A measurement from the start of  the treatment until the criteri a for disease progression is 
met as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_577850] will be right-censored. 
 8.5. Methods of Measurement 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notatio n using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 28 days before the beginning of t he treatment. 
 Imaging-based evaluation is pr eferred to evalu ation by [CONTACT_3975](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. The same imaging modality must be use d throughout the study to measure d isease. 
 
8.5.1. CT and MRI: CT and MRI are the best currentl y available and most reproducib le methods for measuring 
target lesions. This guideline has defined measurability of les ions on CT scan based on the 
assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_577851] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum si ze for a measurable lesion sho uld be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables  involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, le sion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measureme nt.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable  globally.  As with CT, if an MR I is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimiz ed for the evaluation of the 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-GU14-[ADDRESS_577852], the modalit y used at follow-up should 
be the same as was used at ba seline and the lesions should be m easured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guid elines to prescribe 
specific MRI pulse sequence pa rameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, 
the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisiti on protocol should be 
followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with 
breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 PET-CT.  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal  diagnostic CT quality for use w ith RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the si te can document that the CT pe rformed as part of a PET-
CT is of identical diagnostic qu ality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the 
CT portion of the PET-CT can be use d for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring ca ncer lesions over time.  
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additi onal data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not rou tinely or seriall y performed. 
 
8.5.2. Chest X-Ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions whe n they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by [CONTACT_453102] (CT is preferable).    
8.5.3. Clinical Examination: Clinically detected lesions will  only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g. skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to e stimate size of the lesion, is recommended. Photographs 
should be retained at the institution.  
8.5.4. Cytology and Histology: Cytologic and histologic techni ques can be used to differentiat e between complete and 
partial responses in rare cases  (e.g. after treatment to differ entiate residual benign lesions 
and residual malignant lesions i n germ cell tumors). Cytologic confirmation of the 
neoplastic nature of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment is required when the measurable tumor has met re sponse or stable disease criteria. 
 
8.6. Immune Related Response Criteria: 
This study will evaluate concorda nce of the Immune Related Resp onse Criteria (irRC) with 
RECIST 1.1 and OS. These response  criteria were developed to ov ercome the variable and 
unusual patterns of response to i mmunotherapeutic agents, in pa rticular, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] [34]. The 
development of the guidelines w ere prompted by [INVESTIGATOR_427771], mo stly in subjects with 
metastatic melanoma, of initial disease progression followed by  [CONTACT_453103], late responses, 
and mixed responses with an overa ll decrease in tumor burden.  
 
8.6.1. Antitumor response based on total measurable tumor burden 
For the irRC, only index and measurable new lesions are taken i nto account (in contrast to 
conventional WHO criteria, whic h do not require the measurement  of new lesions, nor do 
they include new lesion measurements in the characterization of  evolving tumor burden). 
At the baseline tumor assessment , the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-GU14-003 Version Date 11OCT2018 
  Confidential  
Page 44 of 70 diameters (SPD) of all index l esions (5 lesions per organ, up t o 10 visceral lesions) is 
calculated. At each subsequent t umor assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, 
measurable lesions (up to 5 new lesions per organ; 10 visceral lesions) are added together 
to provide the total tumor burden:  
Tumor Burden = SPD index lesions  + SPD new, measurable lesions

with nadir, in absence of new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-index lesions  50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline cannot be established nor 25% increase compared with nadir 
PD At least 25% increase in SPD compared with nadir and/or unequivocal progression of non-index lesions and/or appearance of new lesions (at any single time point)  At least 25% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time 
point) in two consecutive observations at 
least 4 wk apart  
 
8.6.2. Time-point response  assessment using irRC 
Percentage changes in tumor burden per assessment time point de scribe the size and growth 
kinetics of both conventional and new, measurable lesions as th ey appear. At each tumor 
assessment, the response in index and new, measurable lesions i s defined based on the 
change in tumor burden (after ruling out irPD). Decreases in tu mor burden must be assessed 
relative to baseline measuremen ts (i.e., the SPD of all index l esions at screening). The irRC 
were derived from WHO criteria and, therefore, the thresholds o f response remain the same. 
However, the irRC response categories have been modified from those of WHO criteria as detailed in Tables 8 and 9.  
 8.6.3. Overall response using the irRC 
The sum of the products of diameters at tumor assessment using the immune-related 
response criteria (irRC) for progressive disease incorporates t he contribution of new 
measurable lesions. Each net Percentage Change in Tumor Burden per assessment using 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-GU14-003 Version Date 11OCT2018 
  Confidential  
Page 45 of 70 irRC criteria accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old and new lesions as they 
appear. 
Definition of Index Lesions Response Using irRC 
 irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all index lesions. This category 
encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_453104]. 
 irPartial Response (irPR):  Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum o f 
the products of the [ADDRESS_577853] p erpendicular diameters of all index and all new measurable 
lesions (ie, Percentage Change in Tumor Burden). Note:  the appearance of new measurable 
lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden, but does not  automatically qualify as 
progressive disease until the SPD increases by ≥ 25% when compa red to SPD at nadir. 
 irStable Disease (irSD):  Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of 
progressive disease. 
 irProgressive Disease (irPD):  At least 25% increase Percentage Change in Tumor Burden 
(i.e., taking sum of the products of all index lesions and any new lesions) when compared to 
SPD at nadir. 
 
Definition of Non-Index Lesions Response Using irRC 
 irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all non-index lesions. This 
category encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_941] m WHO criteria. 
 irPartial Response (irPR) or irStable Disease (irSD):  non-index lesion(s) are not 
considered in the definition of P R, these terms do not apply. 
 irProgressive Disease (irPD):  Increases in number or size of non-index lesion(s) does not 
constitute progressive disease unless/until the Percentage Chan ge in Tumor Burden 
increases by 25% (i.e., the SPD a t nadir of the index lesions i ncreases by [CONTACT_453105]).  
 Impact of New Lesions on irRC 
New lesions in and  by [CONTACT_453106] p rogressive disease. However, t heir 
contribution to total tumor burden is included in the SPD, whic h in turn feeds into the irRC 
criteria for tumor response. The refore, new non-measurable lesions will not discontinue any 
subject from the study. 
Definition of Overall Response Using irRC 
Overall response using irRC will be based on these criteria (se e Table 9): 
 Immune-Related Complete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all tumor 
lesions (index and non-index together with no new measurable/un measurable lesions) for at 
least 4 weeks from the date of doc umentation of complete respon se.  
 Immune-Related Partial Response (irPR): The sum of the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters of all index lesions is measured and ca ptured as the SPD baseline. 
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of the products of  t h e  t w o  l a r g e s t  
perpendicular diameters of all i ndex lesions and of new measurable lesions are added 
together to provide the Immune R esponse Sum of Product Diameters (irSPD). A decrease, 
relative to baseline of the irSPD compared to the previous SPD baseline, of 50% or greater 
is considered an immune Partial Response (irPR).  
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-GU14-003 Version Date 11OCT2018 
  Confidential  
Page 46 of 70  Immune-Related Stable Disease (irSD):  irSD is defined as the failure to meet criteria for 
immune complete response or imm une partial response, in the abs ence of progressive 
disease.  
 Immune-Related Progressive Disease (irPD):  It is recommended in difficult cases to 
confirm PD by [CONTACT_453107]. Any of the following will constit ute progressive disease: 
o At least 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index l esions over nadir SPD 
calculated for the index lesions. 
o At least a 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index  lesions and new 
measurable lesions (irSPD) over the baseline SPD calculated for  the index lesions. 
 
Immune-Related Best Overall Response Using irRC (irBOR)  
irBOR is the best confirmed ir RC overall response over the stud y as a whole, recorded between 
the date of first dose until the last tumor assessment before s ubsequent therapy (except for local 
palliative radiotherapy for painful bone lesions) for the indiv idual subject in the study. For the 
assessment of irBOR, all available assessments per subject are considered. 
 irCR or irPR determinations included in the irBOR assessment mu st be confirmed by a second 
(confirmatory) evaluation meeti ng the criteria for response and performed no less than [ADDRESS_577854] met.

9.7. Correlate baseline proteomic and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_453058] t o clinical response.  
Subjects who consent to allow future analysis of left over corr elative samples will have 
baseline serum analyzed for imm une classifiers. Predictive test s to aid in therapeutic decision 
making are critical for optimizing patient outcomes while minim izing toxicity and associated 
treatment costs. These samples will provide data for proteomics  and biomarker development 
via mass spectroscopy. This can be accomplished with a process of proteomic profiling, 
followed by [CONTACT_453110], and then measuring the identified target proteins. 
These samples may also provide data for metabolomics guided by [CONTACT_453111]. This 
approach, known as multiple reactio n monitoring (MRM)-profiling , uses specific metabolite 
fragmentations related to func tional groups and classes to inte rrogate the metabolome. 
Immunotherapy mechanisms are de pendent upon the interactions between the tumor, tumor 
microenvironment, and the host immune system. As such, a succes sful predictive test will 
reflect the complex interpla y between tumor and host. Pre-treat ment serum and/or plasma 
samples will be used to explore the association of proteomic an d lipi[INVESTIGATOR_453070].

 Gastrointestinal Perforations 
Serious and sometimes fatal gastrointestinal perforation occurs  at a higher incidence in 
bevacizumab treated patients compared to controls. The incidenc e of gastrointestinal 
perforation ranged from 0.3 to 2.4% across clinical studies.   The typi[INVESTIGATOR_453071], nausea, em esis, constipation, and fever. 
Perforation can be complicated by [CONTACT_90169]-abdominal abscess and f istula formation. The 
majority of cases occurred with in the first [ADDRESS_577860] 28 days after surgery. In a controlled clinical trial, 
the incidence of wound healing complications, including serious  and fatal complications, in 
patients with mCRC who underwent surgery during the course of b evacizumab treatment was 
15% and in patients who did not r eceive bevacizumab, was 4%. 
 Bevacizumab should not be initiat ed for at least [ADDRESS_577861] dose of bevacizumab a nd elective surgery is 
unknown; however, the half-life of  bevacizumab is estimated to be [ADDRESS_577862] patterns of bleeding: minor hemorrhage, most commonly Grade 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]; and serious, and in some cases fata l, hemorrhagic events. 
Severe or fatal hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, gastrointesti nal bleeding, hematemesis, 
CNS hemorrhage, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and vaginal bleeding occurred up to five-fold more frequently in 
patients receiving bevacizumab compared to patients receiving only chemotherapy. Across indications, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhagic events amon g patients receiving 
bevacizumab ranged from 1.2 to 4.6%.  
Serious or fatal pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in four of 13 (3 1%) patients with squamous 
cell histology and two of 53 (4%) patients with non-squamous no n-small cell lung cancer 
receiving bevacizumab and chemotherapy compared to none of the 32 (0%) patients receiving chemotherapy alone. 
In clinical studies in non–small cell lung cancer where patient s with CNS metastases who 
completed radiation and surgery more than 4 weeks prior to the start of bevacizumab were 
evaluated with serial CNS imaging, symptomatic Grade 2 CNS hemo rrhage was documented 
in one of 83 bevacizumab -treated p atients (rate 1.2%, 95% CI 0 .06%–5.93%). 
 Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 8 of 163 patients with prev iously treated glioblastoma; 
two patients had Grade 3–4 hemorrhage.  
Do not administer bevacizumab to subjects with recent history of hemoptysis of ≥ 1/2 teaspoon of red blood. Discontinue bevacizumab in subjects with  hemorrhage.  
Non-Gastrointestinal Fistula Formation Serious and sometimes fatal non-gastrointestinal fistula format ion involving 
tracheoesophageal, bronchopleura l, biliary, vaginal, renal, and  bladder sites occurs at a higher 
incidence in bevacizumab -treated patients compared to controls . The incidence of non-
gastrointestinal perforation was ≤ 0.3% in clinical studies. Mo st events occurred within the 
first 6 months of bevacizumab therapy.  Discontinue bevacizumab in subjec ts with fistula formation invo lving an internal organ.  
 Arterial Thromboembolic Events  Serious, sometimes fatal, arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) including cerebral 
infarction, transient ischemic a ttacks, myocardial infarction, angina, and a variety of other 
ATE occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevaci zumab compared to those in 
the control arm. Across indications, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3  ATE in the bevacizumab 
containing arms was 2.6% compared to 0.8% in the control arms. Among patients receiving 
bevacizumab in combination with c hemotherapy, the risk of devel opi[INVESTIGATOR_453072] a history of arterial thromboembolism, diabetes, or age greater than 65 years.  
 
The safety of resumption of bevacizumab therapy after resolutio n of an ATE has not been 
studied. Discontinue bevacizumab in subjects who experience a s evere ATE.

Hypertension The incidence of severe hypertension is increased in patients r eceiving bevacizumab as 
compared to controls. Across clinical studies, the incidence of  Grade 3 or 4 hypertension 
ranged from 5-18%.  Monitor blood pressure every two  to three weeks during treatmen t with bevacizumab. Treat 
with appropriate anti- hypertensive therapy and monitor blood pr essure regularly. Continue to 
monitor blood pressure at regular intervals in subjects with be vacizumab -induced or -
exacerbated hypertension after di scontinuation of bevacizumab. 
 Temporarily suspend bevacizumab in subjects with severe hypertension that is not controlled with medical management. Discont inue bevacizumab in subjects wi th hypertensive crisis or 
hypertensive encephalopathy.   Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) RPLS has been reported with an in cidence of < 0.1% in clinical s t u d i e s .  T h e  o n s e t  o f  
symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after initiation of bevacizumab. RPLS is a neurological disorder, which can present with headache, seizure , lethargy, confusion, 
blindness, and other visual and neu rologic disturbances. Mild t o severe hypertension may be 
present. Magnetic resonance im aging (MRI) is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RPLS. 
 Discontinue bevacizumab in subje cts developi[INVESTIGATOR_453073]. Symptoms u sually resolve or 
improve within days, although some patients have experienced on going neurologic sequelae. 
The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients prev iously experiencing RPLS is 
not known.   Proteinuria The incidence and severity of pr oteinuria is increased in patie nts receiving bevacizumab as 
compared to controls. Nephrotic syndrome occurred in < 1% of patients receiving bevacizumab in clinical trials, in some instances with fatal ou tcome. In a published case 
series, kidney biopsy of six patients with proteinuria showed f indings consistent with 
thrombotic microangiopathy.  Monitor proteinuria by [CONTACT_453112]. Subjects with a 2 + or greater 
urine dipstick reading should unde rgo further assessment with a  24-hour urine collection. 
 Suspend bevacizumab administration for ≥ 2 grams of proteinuria /24 hours and resume when 
proteinuria is < 2 gm/24 hours. Continue to monitor until 24-hr  protein demonstrates < [ADDRESS_577863]-

 Stop infusion if a severe infusion reaction occurs and administ er appropriate medical therapy.  
 Ovarian Failure 
The incidence of ovarian failure was higher (34% vs. 2%) in pre menopausal women receiving 
bevacizumab in combination with mFOLFOX chemotherapy as compare d to those receiving 
mFOLFOX chemotherapy alone for adjuvant treatment for colorecta l cancer, a use for which 
bevacizumab is not approved. Inform females of reproductive pot ential of the risk of ovarian 
failure prior to starting treatment with bevacizumab.  
Nursing Considerations 
Advise subjects: 
 To undergo routine blood pressure monitoring and to contact [CONTACT_453113]. 
 To immediately contact [CONTACT_453114], high fever, 
rigors, sudden onset of worseni ng neurological function, or per sistent or severe 
abdominal pain, severe constipation, or vomiting. 
 Of increased risk of wound heali ng complications during and fol lowing bevacizumab. 
 Of increased risk of an arter ial thromboembolic event. 
 Of the potential risk to the fetus during and following bevaciz umab and the need to 
continue adequate contraception for at least [ADDRESS_577865] dose of bevacizumab. 
 Of the increased risk for ovaria n failure following bevacizumab  treatment.

 Side Effects 
Please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Broch ure for a complete list of adverse 
events.  Pembrolizumab is generally well tolerated and demonstrates a fa vorable safety profile in 
comparison to chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab is an immunomodulator y agent, and based on 
this mechanism of action, immune  mediated adverse events are of  primary concern. 
Important identified risks for  pembrolizumab are of an immune m ediate nature, including: 
pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, endocrinopathies th at include hypophysitis 
(including hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_453074]) , thyroid disorder 
(hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism a nd thyroiditis), Type I diabe tes mellitis, uveitis, 
myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome , pancreatitis, myocarditis, m yasthenic syndrome, 
encephalitis, sarcoidosis, severe skin reactions including Stev ens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) 
and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] ( TEN), some with fatal outcome; and “solid organ transplant 
rejection following pembrolizuma b treatment in donor organ reci pi[INVESTIGATOR_840]” (risk applicable to 
post-marketing setting only, as su ch patients are currently exc luded from [COMPANY_006] clinical 
trials with pembrolizumab).  
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-GU14-[ADDRESS_577867] IB (v15) update , the safety profile for pembroli zumab also includes 2 
important potential risks – i.e. i ncreased risk of severe compl ications (such as early severe 
graft versus host disease and ve no-occlusive dise ase) of alloge neic transplant in patients 
with hematologic malignancies w ho have previously been treated with PD-1 inhibitors; and 
GVHD after pembrolizumab administration in patients with a hist ory of allogeneic HSCT. 
 No new identified or potential ri sks have been added to the saf ety profile for 
pembrolizumab since IBv15.  However, based upon additional information received from the cl inical study and post-
marketing environments after r elease of IBv15, the following ch anges have been made to 
the safety information for pembrolizumab:  
1. further information was added t o product labeling to note that immune-mediated 
adverse drug reactions may be fatal and may occur after discont inuation of 
pembrolizumab therapy; and  
2. a new ADR of “arthritis” was identified based primarily on post -marketing experience. 
 Further details around frequency, reporting, and management of immune-related adverse 
events (irAEs) can be found in the  current version of the Inves tigator’s Brochure.  
 In addition to the previously noted  identified risks, infusion-related reactions are a risk but 
are not considered immune mediat ed; these are also further described in the current IB. 
 
 11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
11.1. Definitions of Adverse Events 
 
11.1.1. Adverse Event (AE): 
Any untoward medical occurrence in  a patient or clinical trial subject administered an 
investigational pr oduct and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
the treatment. An adverse event (AE) can, therefore, be any unf avorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal finding) , symptom, or disease tempo rally associated with 
the use of an investigational  product, whether or not related t o the investigational 
product. 
 
11.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE): 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence resu lting in one or more of 
the following: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject w as at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does  not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe) 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-GU14-003 Version Date 11OCT2018 
  Confidential  
Page 57 of 70  Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37511] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event ( defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be 
immediately life-threatening or  result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3092],  based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the  subject or may 
require intervention (e.g., me dical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition a bove). Examples of such even ts include, but are 
not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or  convulsions not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
the development of dru g dependency or drug abuse. 
 Pembrolizumab overdose. For purpo ses of this trial, an overdose  will be defined as 
any dose exceeding the prescribed dose for pembrolizumab by 20%  over the 
prescribed dose. 
 
11.1.3. Unexpected Adverse Event: 
An adverse event not mentioned i n the Investigator's Brochure or package insert or the 
specificity or severity of whic h is not consistent with the Inv estigator's Brochure or 
package insert. 
 
11.2. Adverse Event (AE) Reporting 
Adverse events (AEs) will be reco rded from the time of consent and for at least 30 days 
after treatment discontinuation, regardless of whether or not t he event(s) are considered 
related to trial medications. All AEs considered related to tri al medication will be followed 
until resolution, return to baseline, or deemed clinically insi gnificant, even if this occurs 
post-trial. All adverse events r egardless of CTCAE grade must a lso be evaluated for 
seriousness.  
11.3. Definition and Reporting of an Overdose 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed 
dose for pembrolizumab by 20% over the prescribed dose. No spec ific information is 
available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the  event of overdose, subject 
should be observed closely for si gns of toxicity. Appropriate s upportive treatment should 
be provided if clinically indicated.  If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, ev en if no other seriousness 
criteria are met.  If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of  overdose is taken without 
any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results , the overdose is reported 
as a non-serious Event of Clinical  Interest (ECI), using the te rminology “accidental or 
intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 1 
working day to BTCRC Administrative Headquarters (AHQ). BTCRC A HQ will report

FAX [PHONE_833]). 
 
11.4. Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation 
Although pregnancy and lactation ar e not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility 
of investigators or their desi gnees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject 
(spontaneously reported to the m), including the pregnancy of a male subject's female 
partner that occurs during the t rial or within [ADDRESS_577868] be 
followed to the completion/term ination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of 
spontaneous abortion, missed abo rtion, benign hydatidiform mole , blighted ovum, fetal 
death, intrauterine death, miscar riage and stillbirth must be r eported as serious events 
(Important Medical Events). If th e pregnancy continues to term,  the outcome (health of 
infant) must also be reported.  Such events must be reported w ithin 1 working day to BTCRC AHQ.  BTCRC AHQ will 
report the event with in 1 working day to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety (A ttn: Worldwide Product 
Safety; FAX [PHONE_833]).  
11.5. Definition and Reporting of Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) 
Selected non-serious and serious  adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical 
Interest (ECI) and must be recorded as such on the Adverse Even t case report 
forms/worksheets and reported to BTCRC AHQ within [ADDRESS_577869] for this trial include: 
1. An overdose of [COMPANY_006] product, as  defined above, that is not ass ociated with clinical 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  
2. An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of 
normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab va lue that is greater than or equal to 2X the 
upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline  phosphatase lab value that is 
less than 2X the upper limit of  normal, as determined by [CONTACT_453115]-specified 
laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* *NOTE:  These criteria are ba sed upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to spe cify a threshold of abnormal h epatic tests that may 
require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  
 Subjects should be assessed for  possible ECIs prior to each dose. Lab results should be 
evaluated and subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive of an immune-related event. Subjects who deve lop an ECI thought to be immune-related should have 
additional testing to rule out ot her etiologic causes. If lab results or symptoms indicate a 
possible immune-related ECI, the n additional testing should be performed to rule out other 
etiologic causes. If no other cause is found, then it is assume d to be immune-related.  
 ECIs that occur in any subject from the date of first dose thro ugh 90 days following 
cessation of treatment, or the i nitiation of a new anticancer t herapy, whichever is earlier, 
whether or not related to the Me rck’s product, must be reported within 1 working day to

  12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1. Study Design 
Phase Ib: The primary objective of the Pha se Ib dose escalation cohort study is to establish the safe 
dose of study drug pembrolizumab when used in combination with bevacizumab for 
subjects with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of at least one 
systemic therapy for metastatic d isease. A standard “3+3” desig n will be used to establish 
the safe dose. An expansion cohort of 6 patients will be carrie d out during the Phase Ib 
study at the maximum safe dose, prior to opening the Phase II p ortion. This will ensure 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-GU14-003 Version Date 11OCT2018 
  Confidential  
Page 61 of 70 ample safety data of the com bination and provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_453066] 12 patients in the 
second-line RCC setting. 
 Phase II: The primary objective of the Phase II trial is to determine the  activity of the combination of 
pembrolizumab and bevacizumab in first line therapy for subject s with metastatic clear cell 
RCC as assessed by [CONTACT_30530] (RR) (complete or partial resp onse) based on RECIST 1.1. 
The maximum safe dose of pembrolizumab in combination bevacizumab will be given on day [ADDRESS_577872] the disease under study to warrant future deve lopment.  
 Correlative research analyses includes examining the relationsh ip between clinical response 
a t  t h e  e n d  o f  C y c l e  2  ( W e e k  6 )  o f  t h e  t r e a t m e n t  p e r i o d  w i t h  P D - L1 expression, tumor 
vascular density, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell tumor infiltrati on of the archived diagnostic 
tumor tissue. Research analyses also include examining the rela tionship between changes in 
number of circulating tumor cells, soluble PD-L1 levels, and VEGFc levels from baseline to the end of Cycle 2 (Week 6) of t he treatment period and clinical response at that time.  
 12.2. Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_453075] [ADDRESS_577873] udy will be stopped if ≥ [ADDRESS_577874] 20, or ≥ [ADDRESS_577875] 30 
subjects, or ≥ [ADDRESS_577876] (i.e. the 
planned treatment regimen) rather than the actual treatment giv en. It has the consequence 
that subjects allocated to a tr eatment group should be followed  up, assessed, and analyzed 
as members of that group irrespe ctive of their compliance to th e planned course of treatment. 
 
12.4. Sample Size 
 
Phase Ib:  A standard “3+3” design will be used with maximum number of sub jects accrued to be 12. 
An expansion cohort of 6 patients will be carried out during th e Phase Ib study at the 
maximum safe dose, prior to opening the Phase II portion.  
 Phase II:  Study endpoint will be response (PR or CR) as assessed by [CONTACT_941] R ECIST v1.1 criteria. Clinical 
studies identified a response ra te with pembrolizumab of 27% in  kidney cancer. With 
assumptions of 80% power to detect a 55% improvement to a respo nse rate of 42% in 
response by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 in the combination arm over historic da ta on single agent 
pembrolizumab activity in RCC , and an alpha e rror is 0.107, the  optimal Simon’s two stage 
design proceeds as follows. After testing the drug on [ADDRESS_577877] 7 respond , the trial goes on to the second

Data and Safety Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines: BTCRC AHQ will compi[INVESTIGATOR_453077]. BTCRC AHQ will submit data  summary reports at 
minimum twice per year for rev iew by [CONTACT_453119] (DSMC).  
 
13.2. Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
 
13.2.1. Case Report Forms:  
An electronic case report form ( eCRF) is required and must be c ompleted for each 
included subject. The complete d dataset is housed at BTCRC AHQ and is the sole 
property of the sponsor-investigator’s institution. It should not be made available in any form to third parties, except fo r authorized representatives of  appropriate 
Health/Regulatory Authorities, w ithout written permission from the sponsor-investigator 
and BTCRC AHQ. After the initial publication, the complete data  set will be available to 
all BTCRC institutions. 
13.2.2. Record Retention: To enable evaluations and/or aud its from Health Authorities/BTC RC AHQ, the 
investigator agrees to keep record s, including the identity of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records; e.g., hospi [INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed

Page 66 of 70 informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_453078], and detailed records of drug 
disposition. To comply with int ernational regulations, the reco rds should be retained by 
[CONTACT_453120]. 
 
During data entry, range and missing data checks will be performed on-line. The checks to be performed will be documented in the Data Monitoring Plan for the study. A 
summary report (QC Report) of t hese checks together with any qu eries resulting from 
manual review of the eCRFs will  be generated for each site and transmitted to the site 
and the site monitor. Correcti ons will be made by [CONTACT_340138] e personnel. This will be 
done on an ongoing basis.  
13.3. Confidentiality 
There is a slight risk of loss of confidentiali ty of subject information. All records 
identifying the subject will be  kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_3999]/or regulat ions, will not be made publicly available.   
 Information collected will be  maintained on secure, password pr otected electronic systems. 
Paper files that contain personal information will be kept in l ocked and secure locations 
only accessible to the study team. Samples that are collected w ill be identified by a subject 
study number assigned at the time  of registration to the trial.  Any material issued to 
collaborating researc hers will be anonymi zed and only identifie d by [CONTACT_453121].  Subjects will be informed in writing that some organizations including the sponsor-investigator and his/her researc h associates, BTCRC AHQ, [COMPANY_006],  IRB, or government 
agencies, like the FDA, may inspect their medical records to ve rify the information 
collected, and that all personal information made available for  inspection will be handled 
in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection laws. 
 If the results of the  study are published, t he subject’s identi ty will remain confidential. 
 
13.4. Changes to the Protocol 
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreeme nt of the Sponsor 
Investigator, BTCRC AHQ, and [COMPANY_006].  If it is necessary for the study protocol to be amended, the am endment or a new version of 
the study protocol (amended protoc ol) will be generated by [CONTACT_453122] C AHQ and must be 
approved by [CONTACT_9906], [COMPANY_006], and if  applicable, also the local regulatory authority. Local 
requirements must be followed.  If a protocol amendment requires a change to the Written Inform ed Consent Form, then the 
IRB must be notified. Approval of t he revised Written Informed Consent Form by [CONTACT_453123].  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_453079], and to the staff at his or her center. The distributio n of these documents to the 
regulatory authority will be handl ed according to local practice.

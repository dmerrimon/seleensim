Investigational Sites  Up to [ADDRESS_413271]  Page 10 CONFIDENTIAL  Sham Control  Arm  
Subjects in the Sham Control arm will undergo the same 
preoperative assessments as those in the Latera Treatment  arm up to 
and including anesthesia for the implant  and cannula insertion  into 
the nasal lateral wall , however, no implant will be placed. 
Randomization to the Sham Control Arm  will be assessed by [CONTACT_334827] ( DMC ) at each interim 
analysis time point.  If the pre -determined efficacy , safety or 
operational  criteria  are met , randomization may be terminated.

LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413279] obstruction can be caused by [CONTACT_334830], enlarged turbinates or a weakened nasal lateral wall, leading to nasal valve collapse (NVC). The nasal valve, first described in the early 20th century by M ink,
[ADDRESS_413280] obstruction.  
This is due to the Hagen –Poiseuille law which describes flow through a tube as proportional to the 4th 
power of the radius of the tube and inversely proportional to the pressure difference across the tube.   
Common causes of NVC are prior rhinoplasty, aging, nasal trauma and congenital abnormalities that 
weaken the nasal cartilage, leading to a lateral wall weakness or insufficiency (LWI) .3,[ADDRESS_413281] been limited.  These include invasive surgical procedures and non -
surgical solutions to temporarily dilate the nasal valve, such as Breathe Ri te® strips or nasal cones.  
Surgical strategies that involve septoplasty5 or inferior turbinate reduction6 may alleviate impaired nasal 
breathing, but do not directly address the weakened lateral wall. Procedures intended to stabilize the lateral wall include cartilaginous g rafts typi[INVESTIGATOR_334801],

invasive technique to address NVC by [CONTACT_334831].  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_334802], to enable a less invasive alternative to current surgical approaches used to suppor t weak lateral wall cartilage. This device has 
been cleared by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) and is currently in commercial distribution.   
1.2. Prior Investigations  
There have been three prior investigations of the Latera device, including an initial  study performed in 
[LOCATION_013], the LATERAL OR  study, and the LATERAL Office study . 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413283]  Page 15 CONFIDENTIAL  Initial German Study  
The initial study sponsored by [CONTACT_84899][INVESTIGATOR_334803] a prospective, multicenter, non -randomized, single -arm trial 
(NCT# 02188589), implanting the device in 30 subjects at three inve stigational sites in [LOCATION_013].a 
Subjects with nasal valve collapse due to weakened lateral cartilage were included, and the device was 
used to support the upper and lower lateral nasal cartilage.  Fifty -six devices were implanted in 30 
subjects, who were then followed for 24 months.    
Safety data was assessed at three (3) months as the primary safety endpoint, with 5 implant/device related events in 4 subjects. These events included 3 extrusions (device required retrieval), [ADDRESS_413284] device -related adverse event (AE) rate of 13%. 
The device extrusions were internal nasal cavity extrusions related to the implantation technique or nasal 
manipulation by [CONTACT_423]. None of these events were associated with signs of tissue rejection for foreign body response and all occurred within the first postoperative month. The implanted devices were 
uneventfully removed with forceps at the time of the observation and no open surgical intervention was 
required. Each event resolved without f urther clinical sequelae.  
Effectiveness of the device was assessed using the  NOSE scores through follow -up time points  at 1 
month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months .  The NOSE score is a validated 
scori ng system for nasal obstruction.
17 The NOSE scores are assessed using a validated questionnaire 
using patient responses to a set of five (5) questions.  A percent responder rate was calculated at each follow up time  point to asses s the proportion of subjects that noted a benefit.  Responder Rate is defined 
as the proportion of subjects with at least one (1) NOSE class improvement or at least 20% NOSE score reduction.  The NOSE Categories are as follows: mild 5 -25 points, moderate 55- 75 points, extreme 80 -
100 points .  The responder rate was 86.7% at 1 month, 86.2% at 3 months, and continued improvement 
of 80% at [ADDRESS_413285] at the 3 -month follow -up time point in 1/30 subjects (3%).

data are provided to share Latera experience in a broader patient population and based in the U.S.  Current 
data is preliminary and is subject to change.  
The LATERAL OR and Office clinical trials are designed for data collection and reporting on the Latera Nasal Implant.  Three hundred and thirty (330) subjects  with nasal valve collapse due to weakened lateral 
cartilage were enrolled, and the device was used to support the upper and lower lateral nasal cartilage.  These studies do allow for concomitant procedures such as septoplasty and turbinate reduction, as additional interventions for NAO beyond the Latera NVC intervention. Table 1 ( below ) summarizes 
information available to date (n=278 ) and the completed study above.  A comprehensive review of all 
available clinical data on the Latera Absorbable Nasal Implant shows consistent results in improvements 
in nasal breathing.  Adverse device effects are few and are non -serious.

1.3. Current Study: The Latera Randomized Controlled Trial 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_334805] a clinical study to evaluate the performance of the device in comparison to no 
intervention, in this case, a “sham treatment”.  The study design and methods have been developed usin g 
input from previous and ongoing studies with the Latera Implant .   
This randomized, single -blind, sham -controlled, multicenter study of the Latera Nasal Absorbable 
Implant will enroll subjects with nasal valve collapse due to or primarily due to insuffic ient cartilaginous 
support of the lateral nasal wall into one of two treatment arms, a) implantation with the Latera device or 
b) Sham Control.
2. STUDY DEVICE
This is a Non -Significant Risk (“NSR”), post -marketing study and will be conducted in accordance wi th 
the requirements prescribed in 21 CFR §812.2(b). Because it is a post -market evaluation of a 510(k) 
cleared medical device in commercial distribution, used according to FDA cleared indications for use, investigational device labeling described under §812.2(b) is not required. The choice of conducting this study under §812.2(b) represents a conservative approach as the study could otherwise have been categorized as Exempted per §812.2(c).

2.5. Device Description  
The absorbable nasal Implant is comprised of a 70:30 blend of poly(L -lactide) and poly(D -lactide). The 
Implant is predominantly cylindrical in shape with a diameter of [ADDRESS_413291]  Page 19 CONFIDENTIAL   
 
Figure 2: LATERA  Absorbable Nasal Implant and Packaging  
 
The Delivery Device is a single use device composed of an inner shaft, an outer handle with a push rod, a 
deploy button, an open button and a 16-gauge  delivery cannula with a protective cover. The inner shaft 
includes an implant loading port which enables the loading of the Implant . The inner shaft transitions 
between the loading position and the cannula to collapse the implant forks within the cannula inner lumen and prepare the Implant for deployment. The outer handle includes deploy and open buttons that  lock and 
release the handle from these respective positions. The outer handle also includes a push rod that shuttles 
the implant from the implant loading port to a ready position for deployment. The Implant Positioning 
Guide is packaged with the Delivery Device and is provided as an aid to the physician for planning the 
procedure and identifying the target Implant location. The Delivery Device and the Implant Positioning 
Guide are shown in Figure 3 below.

14. Female subjects, of child bearing potential, known or suspected to be pregnant or are lactating;  
15. Any other presenting condition that, in the medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would disqualify 
the subject from the study. 
4.2. Patient Screening and Informed Consent  
The investigator or designee, who is trained on the study protocol, will review and explain the study 
protocol and information, including the potential risks and benefits of participation.  Time will be made available for the patient to read through the materials  and ask questions .  A study and protocol -specific 
Informed Consent Form (ICF), approved by a ce ntral or appropriate local  Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) will be obtained from each subject prior to enrollment in the study. An electronic consent (eConsent) will be available on a web -based module of the study’s electronic data capture (EDC) system. 
Alternatively, Investigators may utilize a standard written consent form. In either case, subjects will be 
provided with a hardcopy of the executed ICF. All subjects will be instructed that they are free to decline 
entry into the study or to withdraw from t he study at any time without prejudice to future treatment. After 
completion of the consenting process  and eligibility has been confirmed, subjects will be considered 
consented and enrolled for the study duration of up to [ADDRESS_413298]  Disposition and Flow Chart  
The graphic below  illustrates the flow of subjects in the study and potential points of study exit relative 
to analysis plan  (Figure 4, page 23, below ). Subjects are enrolled at the time of consent, and the ITT 
population is comprised of all consented subjects. Subjects are randomized after the anesthetic is 
administered. Subjects in the active treatment group receive the Latera implant , while those in the Sham 
Control group will undergo insertion of the cannula  into the nasal lateral wall , but the Latera will not be 
implanted. T he mITT  population includes all subjects who were randomized, irrespective of whether they 
received the study device. The PP population includes those subjects who received the study device or 
the Sham Control and who are followed through [ADDRESS_413299]’s withdrawal must be made and an explan ation given 
of why the subject is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study. 
The reason for and date of withdrawal must be recorded on the subject’s Study Exit Case Report Form 
(CRF). If the reason for the withdrawal is a device -related or procedure related AE, the event must be 
reported to the Sponsor and recorded in the  AE CRF.  
Withdrawal can occur  at several time -points that would impact the follow up schedule for a study subject. 
If withdrawal occurs any time  before the treatment procedure, anesthesia and randomization, the subject 
will be exited with no  follow up assessment requirements.  If withdrawal occurs after anesthesia,

LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413300] data at all the follow -up visits (7 days, 30 
days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months , 18 months, 24 months). Due diligence in reaching the subject must 
include:  
•Two documented telephone contact [CONTACT_14386], emails, or regular postal mail letters, and
•A certified letter
After the above attempts are made, if no response is obtained, the Study Exit CRF page will need to be 
completed and communication attempts will need to be documented.  
5.STUDY PROCEDURES AND FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS
5.1. Screening/Baseline Assessment
All patients  seeking treatment for nasal obstruction will be screened for eligibility according to the
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  A member of the  site’s  research team will review the patient’s medical
history for eligibility and potential inclusion into the study.
The Investigator  or their designee will inform the patient about the purpose of the study and will explain
the potential benefits and risks of both study arms, the Latera Implant and/or the Sham Control arm .
Potential subjects will be counseled as to t he nature of their condition. All subjects will have ample time
to ask questions.Patients  indicating that they would like to proceed with study participation, and who are willing to comply 
with the requirements of the study protocol, will be asked to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) t hat
has been approved by [CONTACT_114021].  Failure to provide written informed consent makes  the patient
ineligible for the study.
Female patients  of childbearing potential will undergo a pregnancy test to verify eligibility. Women of
childbearing potential are defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who is NOT
permanently sterile or postmenopausal.  Postmenopausal is defined as twelve (12) consecutive months
with no menses without an alternative medical cause.
Patients will be considered enrolled as study subjects upon signing the ICF and meeting all study
eligibility criteria. Once the subject has been enrolled into the study a baseline assessment will be
completed .
The following baseline data will be collected at the Screening/Baseline visit prior to the procedure. All
data must be recorded in the study specific EDC for Latera RCT within 5 business days.

5.2. Treatment Visit  
The Schedule of Study Activities is located below in Table 2.  Refer to the Instructions for Use (IFU) for 
device de ployment techniques in Attachment C.   
The treatment procedure must be completed in an office setting using standard aseptic techniques.  Local anesthesia per the site’s standard of care practice will be administered to the subjects in each study arm. 
Anesthesia techniques will be documented.  Once the anesthesia has been administered the subject will be randomized into either the Sham Control Arm or the Latera Treatment Arm.   
NOTE:  Randomization will be facilitated using an electron ically secure table t computer  that can 
be used in the exam room setting to access site- specific randomized treatment assignments in the 
EDC . 
Optionally, an oral anxiolytic (e.g. Valium, Ativan or equivalent) and/or analgesic (e.g. Tylenol, or Tylenol with Hydrocodone  or equivalent ) may be offered to the subject prior to the procedure, per the 
investigator’s discretion, consistent with local practice standards. Procedural medications will be 
recorded. 
The below section includes a description of the activitie s occurring during the Latera Implant  or Sham 
Control procedure:  
1. Cephalexine or equivalent antibiotic may be administered to the subject before the procedure,
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413303]  Page 26 CONFIDENTIAL  2. Clean the skin of the nose and the mucosal surface with an antiseptic solution (e.g. isopropyl
alcohol, betadine  or equivalent ),
3.Examine nasal anatomy and mark the target trajectory for the Latera Implants with the aid of a
sterile pen and sterile Latera Implant positioning guide per IFU (Attachment C ).
4. Obtain photographs of planned implant target trajectory,
5.The following local anesthesia steps may be considered per site’s standard of care procedures to
ensure subject comfort during implant placement.
a.SPRAY: Anesthetic (e.g. lidocaine or equivalent)
b.TOPI[INVESTIGATOR_334810]: Few minutes after application of the spray, cotton balls or pledgets soaked inanesthetic (e.g. Tetracaine, 4% lidocaine  or equivalent ) may be placed in the nasal
vestibule, ensuring contact [CONTACT_334833], and to lateralnasal wall anteriorly).
c.INFILTRATION:
i.Anesthetic, such as Lidocaine with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_334811]/
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_334812], or the equivalent, may beinjected locally.
ii.The anesthesia may be injected to achieve an infraorbital block.
iii. In addition, anesthesia may be injected along the proposed implantation track,starting at the alar rim and progressing to the supra-periosteal region of the
maxilla. Additional injections into alar rim may also be considered.
d.Wait approximately [ADDRESS_413304].
6. RANDOMIZATION:  Subjects are randomized into the Sham Control Arm or the Latera Implant
Treatment Arm, after  anesthetic is delivered. Treatment assignment will remain blinded to the
study subject.
7.In the event the subject is selected for the Latera Implant Arm, the implants (bilateral) will be
delivered in a loaded delivery tool, using standard deployment technique per Spi[INVESTIGATOR_334813]
(Attachment  C). Only one Implant per side may be placed.
8.In the event the subject is selected for the Sham Control Arm,  follow the exact same process for
implant delivery per Spi[INVESTIGATOR_334813] ( Attachment  C), including pulling the alar rim back allowing
insertion of the cannula of an unloaded (no implant) delivery tool.  No implant is deployed in the
Sham Control Arm.
The following data will be recorded on the subject’s procedure CRF:  
•Anesthesia regimen
•Photograph image with Trajectory Plan
•The Randomization Assignment

The schedule of study activities (Table 2, page 28, above ) specifies the assessments that will be completed 
at each follow up visit.  Below are the descriptions of the PRO assessments and Lateral Wall Motion 
Video assessment:  
Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale  
The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale is a Patient -Reported Outcome (PRO) 
instrument that will be administered to capture subject perception of the degree of nasal airway patency.17  
The NOSE scale is a validated instrument, developed by [CONTACT_234298]—Head and Neck Surgery (AAO -HNS), and has been used in several clinical trials.  The scale is brief, easy 
to complete, and is an important tool for pre - and post -intervention evaluation of symptoms in subjects 
with nasal obstruction.  
Subjects will be asked: “Since your last follow up visit, how much of a problem were the following conditions for you?” Spec ifically, subjects will be asked to rate their perceptions on the Likert scale with 
respect to the following characteristics:  
• Nasal congestion or stuffiness 
• Nasal blockage or obstruction 
• Trouble breathing through my nose  
• Trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
• Unable to get enough air through my nose during exercise or exertion 
Subjects will rate their responses using a Likert scale with response options 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, as follows:  
• Not a Problem  
• Very Mild Problem  
• Moderate problem  
• Fairly Bad Problem  
• Severe problem  
The responses are rated along the continuum, with a rating of “0 – not a problem” indicating no problem 
breathing, with a completely free flow of air through the nasal airway; “1 – very mild problem”, with 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413308]  Page 30 CONFIDENTIAL  only slight obstruction in airflow; “2 – moderate problem”, with mouth breathing considered easier; “3 – 
fairly bad problem,” with considerable obstruction to airflow; and a rating of “4 – severe problem,” with 
complete blockage and obstruction of the nasal passageway, where the subject cannot breathe thr ough 
the nose and can only mouth breathe.   
Nasal Breathing Assessment  
A subject’s perception of breathing cannot be quantitatively measured, but exists on a continuum from 
the subject perspective.  The  VAS  is a PRO instrument that will be used to capture subjects’ perception 
of their ability to breathe through the nose, allowing subjects to indicate the degree of breathing difficulty 
(or ease) they are currently experiencing.  
Operationally, the  VAS is a horizontal line, 100mm in length, anchored by [CONTACT_334835], 
as illustrated in Figure [ADDRESS_413309].

Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  
The Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS) is a widely -used PRO in the field of sleep medicine as a subjective 
measure of a patient's sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].   
The test is a list of eight situations that evaluate a subject’s tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0 (no chance of dozing), to 3 (high chance of dozing). The scale estimates whether the subject is experiencing excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_334814].  

Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413310]  Page 31 CONFIDENTIAL  Subjects will be asked: “How sleepy are you?  How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the 
following situations? ”  They will be asked to rate their chances of dozing off, not just feeling tired and 
even if they have not done some of these things recently to try and determine how they would have 
affected them .  For each situation, subjects will be asked to decide if they would have:  
• No chance of dozing    0 
• Slight chance of dozing   1 
• Moderate change of dozing   2 
• High chance of dozing   3 
Using the above scale, subjects  will write down the corresponding choi ce to the following situations: 
• Sitting and reading  
• Watching TV  
• Sitting inactive in a public place (e.g. a theater or a meeting) 
• As a passenger in a car for an hour without a break  
• Lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit  
• Sitting and talking to someone  
• Sitting quietly after lunch without alcohol  
• In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in traffic  
The responses to the above situations is totaled for a final composite score.    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_334815] ( PSQI ) is a questionnaire  used to assess sleep quality over the 
previous 1 -month.  The measure consists of 19 individual items (see CRF), creating [ADDRESS_413311] of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (i.e., how long it takes to fall asleep), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency (i.e., the percentage of time in bed that one is asleep), sleep disturbances, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_88794], and daytime dysfunction. 
Lateral Wall Motion Video Assessment  
Video results from Endoscopy assessments will be captured and transferred to Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108].  The videos will 
be de -identified prior to transfer to an independent reviewer.  The independent reviewer will make 
assessment of endoscopic lateral wall insufficiency score (1, 2 or 3).[ADDRESS_413312] one (1) NOSE class improvement or 
at least 20% NOSE score reduction from baseline to [ADDRESS_413313] treatment.  
The treatment (p T) and control (p C) will be compared using a 1-sided test for  superiority of  the following 
hypothesis:  
H0:   pT ≤ p C versus  H A:  p T > p C 
6.2. Study Populations  
Adult male and female patients presenting with symptomatic nasal valve collapse due to or primarily due to insufficient cartilaginous support of the lateral nasal wall will be enrolled, if they meet all eligibility 
criteria.  The study will inc lude up to 150 subjects enrolled at up to 15 investigational sites in the US.  
The maximum enrollment per site will be 20% of the total enrollment number therefore a [ADDRESS_413314] 
maximum per site.   Initial site enrollment will be limited to 20 -subjects and w ritten permission from 
Sponsor will be required to enroll up to 30 subjects ma ximum.  
The following populations will be analyzed in the study:  
Intention- to-Treat (ITT) Population:  The ITT analysis will be performed on all enrolled subjects 
in the study , irrespective of adherence with the entry criteria, treatment actually received, subsequent 
withdrawal, or deviation from the Clinical Investigational P lan.20 Subjects who are enrolled but not 
randomized will not be included in the analytic datasets.  
Modified Intention- to-Treat (mITT) Population: The mITT Population will comprise of ITT 
subjects who received anesthetic, regardless of whether they  received the Latera Implant  or 
underwent the Sham procedure. Subjects who are in the mITT population assigned to the  Latera 
Implant  Arm but who do not receive the device are followed for 3 months  for safety -related 
endpoints  and will be exited after 3-month follow -up assessments.   
Per Protocol Population:  The PP analysis will be performed on randomized subjects a) in t he Sham 
Control Arm, and b) in the Latera Implant  Arm who were treated and who had NOSE score 
assessments within the [ADDRESS_413315] 
is in the Sham Control group, a Latera implant  may be implanted if they meet the eligibility criteria . 
Subjects who are un -blinded (within either treatment arm) prior to the [ADDRESS_413316] of proportions. Assuming a Sham Control 
response rate of 40% and a Latera Treatment response rate of 70% at month 3, a maximum sample size 
of 124 evaluable subjects is required for 90% power and preserving a 2.5% (one -sided) ty pe I error rate. 
This study is designed as a group -sequential trial with 2 interim analyses and a final analysis. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334816] [1], which is a special case of Unified Family 
(Power) boundaries. A shape parameter of 0.[ADDRESS_413317] been enrolled. The Latera 
response rate has been observed at approximately 85% in single -arm trials, and is likely to be slightly 
lower in a single blind setting. Thus, 70% is likely a conservative estimate. The placebo response rate 
observed in pain trials is approximately 30%, and may be even higher in a procedural setting, so 40% 
was selected for the  control response rate used in the study design calculations.  
Assuming up to a 10% drop out rate and a 10% potential retrieval rate, the sample size is adjusted up to

The baseline demographics and anatomic characteristics of the treatment groups will be presented with 
descriptive statistics.  
6.7. Changes to Planned Analyses 
All analyses will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Any changes to the planned analyses 
will be documented as amendments to the SAP and in the study report. 
6.8. Interim Analyses  
There will be two planned interim analyses for this study ( Table 3, below ). The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334817]. When the design assumptions are 
correct (40% versus 70%), the chance that the trial will stop for effectiveness at the second interim 
analysis is about 1 in 3. However, if t he Latera rate is 85% as seen in the single arm studies, the chance 
of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334818] [ADDRESS_413319] 20 -30% of the total 
sample size, depending on the enrollment rate. 
Interim analyses will be carried out by [CONTACT_334836] b y the independent DMC .

7. STUDY MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS 
7.1. Data Management: Collection of Clinical Data  
The Sponsor and/or assigned designee will be responsible for the processing and quality control of the 
data. All other source data, source documents, CRFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_222978], 
device accountability forms, correspondence, subject identification lists, informed consent forms, and other essential documents must also be retained for a period of at least [ADDRESS_413320] be given to the Sponsor.  
7.2. Protocol Amendments  
Protocol amendments are the sole responsibility of the Sponsor.  No changes from the final approved 
(signed) protocol will be initiated without the IRB’s prior written approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects or when the 
change involves only logistics or administration. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_334819]. 
7.3. Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is the non -adherence to o r divergence from the protocol -specific study procedures. 
The following are all considered protocol deviations: inclusion of subjects outside the eligibility , visits 
outside the scheduled visit windows, missed data collection at visits, improper or lack of consent, lack of 
IRB approval , lack of a dherence to ra ndomization and procedural methods.  A protocol deviation 
undertaken to protect the life or physical well -being of the patient in an emergency is a special 
circumstance that must be reported to the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB within [ADDRESS_413321] of the study. The Sponsor will address deviations and take  appropriate corresponding and corrective action. 
Continued non -compliance with the study protocol may lead to termination of the Investigator’s 
participation in the study. 
7.4. Information to Study Personnel  
The Investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all staff members involved in 
the study or in any element of subject management, both before starting the study procedures and during 
the study (e. g., when new staff become involved). The Investigator must ensure that all study staff 
members are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience, and training to perform their specific responsibilities. 
The Sponsor or its designee  is responsible for explaining the CIP to all study staff, including the 
Investigator, and for ensuring their compliance with the protocol throughout the study. Additional 
information will be made available during the study when new staff become involved in the study, and 
as otherwise agreed upon with either the Investigator or the monitor.

There are other health risks and discomforts associated with the testing that the subjects will undergo 
before and after  their procedure, including but not limited to  pain and bruising at the  implant  pi[INVESTIGATOR_334820].    
For subjects in the Sham Control Group, the use of anesthetic and insertion of the cannula imparts the 
same risks except  for those directly attributable to an implant, without the potential benefit of the 
treatment.  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413323]  methods.   
The Latera Implant is designed and indicated for use to support of the lateral nasal cartilages.  The device 
will be used as directed in the FDA Cleared Indications for Use.  The device has been commercially available in the US for over a year and used in three (3) clinical studies with consistent high efficacy and low complication rates, as described previously .   
The Latera RCT is a Group Sequential Study.  This is an adaptive study design that allows for interim 
data review for potentially halting enrollment for early demonstration of success or for futility (inability to reach the primary objectives).  Additionally, although the treatment assignment is blinded to the study subjects, an independent Data Monitoring Committee will be reviewing the data at pre -determined 
interim analyses to determine if the study is operationally sound or meets pre -determined success criteria, 
limiting randomization to no more subjects than are required to meet the primary objectives .   
Risk mitigation through s tudy operations include the select ion of experienced investigators wit h the 
appropriate research infrastructure, providing training and data monitoring to limit protocol deviations 
and operational execution.  The study includes IRB review and approval of the  study protocol, informed 
consents for appropriate risk disclosure, and the patient brochure and study poster to assure the study meets clinical research standards and regulatory requirements.      
The measures listed above will be implemented in this stud y to mitigate potential risks to the study 
subjects. 
8.3. Benefit to Subjects  
The Latera implant  has been successfully deployed in over 7,[ADDRESS_413324] the same 
potential benefit at that point as those randomized to the Latera  Implant arm.   
8.4. Study Justification  
Nasal valve collapse (NVC)  due to lateral wall weakness is significant contributor to NAO.  The Latera 
Implant offers a minimally invasive treatment to support the lateral cartilages .  The Latera RCT provides 
the opportu nity to rigorously assess the impact of the implant  itself in alleviating the symptoms of NVC  
due to lateral nasal wall weakness.   Patients with other primary contributors to NAO will not be included 
such as sept al conditions  or turbinate  hypertrophy since these potentially mask the full impact of the 
Latera Implant.   Three (3) prospective, single -arm studies have continued to  show the high rate of 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413325] medical occurrence or exacerbation of an existing medical condition 
subsequent to the experimental therapy.  Adverse events are rated in several ways:  
•  Severity (mild, m oderate, severe)  
o Mild: No limitation of usual activities, no therapy or only symptomatic therapy required 
to treat the injury or illness.  
o Moderate : Some limitation of usual activities or specific therapy is required.  
o Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency treatment, life 
threatening events , or death.  
• Anticipated (anticipated, un anticipated)  
• Device and procedure relationships (unrelated, possibly related, definitely related, or relationshi p unknown)  
o Unrelated:  The clinical event is completely independent of study procedure/study 
device and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.  
o Possibly related:  The clinical event occurs within a reasonable time sequence to study 
procedure/study device and there is some evidence to “possibly” suggest a causal relationship. However, the influence of other factors such as underlying disease, 
concomitant medications, or concurrent treatment may have contributed to the event . 
o Definitely related : The clinical event occurs in a plausible time relationship to study 
procedure/study device and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_334837], drugs or chemicals.  
o Relationship unknown : The relationship to the study procedure/study device is not 
known.  
Adverse events will be categorized as either serious or non -serious.  A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is 
an event that meets at least one of the following:  
• Is fatal  
• Is life -threatening  
• Resul ts in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure  
• Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to precl ude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413326] (ADE) is any unwanted and unintended response to a medical device. This 
definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deployment of the device and any event that is a result of user error. A serious adverse device effect 
(SADE) is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious 
adverse  event or that might have led to any of the consequences if suitable action had not been taken or 
intervention had not been made or if circumstances had been less opportune. An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined as “any serious adverse e ffect on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.” 
Section 8.[ADDRESS_413327] until their follow up visits due to the low risk nature of the potential events.   
9.2. Reporting of Adverse Events  
In addition to events considered in the primary efficacy and primary safety analyses, all device - and/or 
procedure -related adverse events must be captured on the Adverse Event Case Report Form. The report 
should include, wherever possible, severity, duration, outcome, and the Investigator’s writ ten medical 
judgment as to the relationship of the adverse event to the study device, procedure, or underlying disease 
(i.e., not related, possibly related, definitely related, or relationship unknown).  
All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor or its Cont ract Research Organization (CRO) within 1 business 
day of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. The event is reported in the electronic data capture 
system. IRB notification of the adverse event may also be required, depending on the conditions of approval or requirements of the respective committee.  Any unanticipated adverse device effects must be 
reported to the Sponsor/CRO within [ADDRESS_413328] learns of it.   
Non-serious reportable adverse events are to be submitted via the electronic data capture system, also, 
within 1 business day  of learning about the event. Certain reportable events may require adjudication; 
therefore, supporting documentation must be sent to the Sponsor/CRO. 
9.3. Medical Monitor  
An independent Medic al Monitor, a member of  the Contract Research Organization, will be charged with 
evaluating all adverse events, device deficiencies (including user errors), device malfunctions, and other 
events that arise during the trial.  Each event will be assessed for  its relatedness to the procedure or to the 
device, classified as to its seriousness and whether it is an unanticipated adverse device effect. All adverse events will be MedDRA coded to the most recent MedDRA version at the time of the start of the trial. In 
the event of a conflict between the site and the Medical Monitor classifications, those of the Medical Monitor will prevail.  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413329]  Page 40 CONFIDENTIAL  9.4. Data Monitoring Committee  
The Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC ) will be used in this study.  It is the responsibility of the DMC  
to assess safety -related issues by [CONTACT_334838]. The DMC  for this 
trial will also assess efficacy with respect t o the group -sequential  design (§6.8 , page 34, above ). The 
DMC  membership is represented from the key medical disciplines involved with nasal interventions, and 
may include an external biostatistician. None of the members is directly involved in other aspects of the 
clinical trial. The Sponsor has contracted a Clinical Research Organization to organize, facilitate, and 
document meetings for the DMC  for this trial. The DMC  will meet regularly and as necessary, guided by 
a DMC  Charter.  
10.STUDY ADMINISTRATION
10.1. Site Initiation  and Study Monitoring
A Site Initiation Visit (SIV) will be conducted by [CONTACT_18484] a designee, for example, its CRO,  to
ensure that all study supplies are present, to ensure proper training of the Investigator and study staffmembers in study -specific procedures, to ensure site readiness i s complete  prior to enrollment of the first
study subject at each  site.
Interim mo nitoring visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_84899][INVESTIGATOR_334821]. personnel or a designee to ensure compliance
with the protocol, source data verification and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines.
10.2. Study Termination
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_334822]. and applicable regulatory authorities have the right to terminate the study or a particular study
site at any time. Situations that could warrant study termination include, but are not limited to:
a)Increased incidence of adverse experiences and/or the severity of such, suggestive of a potential,device- related health hazard
b)Insufficient subject enrollment
c)Recurrent protocol non -compliance, violations or deviations
d)Inaccurate, incomplete, and/or untimely data recording (>5 business days) on a recurrent basis
e)Lack of cooperation with monitoring visits (e.g., failure to adequately prepare for visits, address
action items from one visit to the next, or provide access to medical records)
10.3. Data Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_334823], Signing and Archiving Case Repor t Forms  
The Investigator must keep a separate subject identification list showing enrollment numbers, names, and dates of birth to allow unambiguous identification of each subject included in the study.  It is

LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413330] is participating in a clinical research 
study. 
The required data will be recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs).  Clinical study data will be collected 
using electronic data capture ( EDC ). A web -based EDC  database will be used to reco rd and manage study 
data. CRF completion guidelines, the instructions for electronic data -entry, will be developed in 
conjunction with the sponsor, the CRO, and/or the EDC vendor.  An embedded audit trail will capture 
the date, time and user making updates  and changes to the electronic data.  
A mechanism in the EDC will allow the Investigator to approve the data electronically.  Additionally, 
study worksheets that become source documentation will require Investigator review and approval as 
indicated by [CONTACT_334839].    
Because it is important to have proper data collection in a timely manner, within 5 business days, the 
Investigator/Study Coordinator shall complete the CRFs . When the monitor requests additional data or 
clarification of data for the CRF, the request should be answered satisfactorily before the next monitoring 
visit.  
Data Management and Archiving 
The Sponsor will be responsible for the processing and quality co ntrol of the data. Source data for safety 
will be retained for at least 2 years after the termination/completion of the study .  All other source data, 
eCRFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_222978], device accountability forms, correspondence, 
subject identification lists, informed consent forms, and other essential documents must be retained for a 
period of at least [ADDRESS_413331] will include an electronic informed consent (eIC) and traditional 
paper.  The Investigator or designee, trained on the protocol, will explain the nature, scope , anticipated 
benefits,  and potential risks involved in the study.  Written informed consent will be obtained after the 
aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential risks  are explained.  
All subjects may receive a stipend for their time and to cover travel costs for participation in the Latera 
RCT.  The stipend and schedule must be approved by [CONTACT_2727]’s recognized IRB (central 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413332]  Page 42 CONFIDENTIAL  IRB or local).  The plans for the study is as follows:  After complet ion the following study visits, subjects  
will receive a $50.[ADDRESS_413333] at end of the following visits: Baseline visit, Treatment, one (1) 
week,  one (1), three (3), and six (6) month; and they will receive a $100.[ADDRESS_413334] for  twelve 
(12), eighteen (18) and twenty- four (24) month study visits. The total compensation to each subject  will 
be $600.00 for completion of a ll of the study visits for the Latera Implant group of the study or it will be 
$750.[ADDRESS_413335] informat ion (if requested/required by [CONTACT_334840]) prior to the 
subject agreeing to participate in the trial and signing the study -specific Informed Consent Form.  
Consenting addendums will be used to confirm continuing patient consent in the cases of re -implanting 
procedures and the cross -over implant procedures. 
The subject’s willingness to participate in the study will be documented in writing in a study -specific 
Informed Consent Form, which will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_334841].  The Investigator will keep the original consent form and a copy will be given to the 
subject.  It will be explained to the subjects that they are free to refuse entry into the study and free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment.  
11.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
This study must be approved by [CONTACT_334842]  [ADDRESS_413336] receive a copy of the IRB approval letter (or equivalent documentation) for the study 
protocol and Informed Consent Form before the study can be started at that site or devices shipped to that Investigator.  The Sponsor will provide confirmation that sites may initiate consenting and enrollment 
after review of the approved IRB documents.   
The IRB and Sponsor must approve any significant changes or amendments to the protocol as well as a 
change of Principal Investigator.  Documentation of the IRB approval must be provided to the Sponsor. Records of all study review and approval  documents must be maintained by [CONTACT_334843].  Serious Adverse Events must also be reported to the IRB , as per their reporting 
requirements , and Sponsor (reference Section 10 for reporting instructions).  
The Investigator must notify the IRB, as per their reporting guidelines, and the Sponsor when he or she deviates from the protocol.  The Sponsor must be notified of all  relevant action taken by [CONTACT_228549] a copy of all study -related correspondence between the Investigator and the IRB.

13.1.  Access to Data  
The Sponsor, auditors, and health authority inspectors (or their agents) will be given access to source data 
and document ation (e. g., medical charts/records, laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes, etc.) for 
source data verification, provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local requirements. 
The Investigator must maintain, at all times, the primary records (source document ations ) of each 
subject’s data. Examples of source documents are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], office visit records, examining 
physician’s finding or notes, consultant’s written opi[INVESTIGATOR_72447], laboratory reports, device inventory, device label records, and CRFs that are used as the source (source worksheets) . 
The Investigator will maintain a confidential subject identification list that allows the unambiguous 
identification of each subject. All study -related documents must  be ke pt until notification by [CONTACT_84899][INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc.  
at the study closeout visit.  
13.2.  Security and Confidentiality 
Each  Investigator must ensure that the privacy of all subjects, including their personal identity and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In CRFs and other documents or image 
material submitted to the Sponsor, subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_334844] (i.e., subject number ).  If identifying information is transferred to the Sponsor, the Sponsor will de -
identify or anonymize  the information to the extent possible.  Information will be maintained in a secure 
manner.  
Personal medical information may be reviewed to verifying data  recorded in the CRFs. The monitor may 
perform source data verification on behalf of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. Personal medical 
information will always be treated as confidential.  
Electronic data will only be accessible to authorized personnel  using a unique user identifier and 
password. Access to electronic study data will be provided to research personnel upon completion of training. Read and write access will be provided to investigational sites but only for information and subject data at t heir own site. The CRO will have read -only access and can post queries for potent ial data -
related discrepancies.

Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964. Amended by [CONTACT_941] 29th 
World Medical Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975; 35th World Medical Assembly, Venice, Italy, 
October 1983; and the 41st World Medical Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989. 
 
 0. Introduction 
I. Basic Principles  
II. Medical Research Combined with Clinical Care (Clinical Research)  
III. Non -Therapeutic Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Non- Clinical Biomedical 
Research)  
 
Introduction  
It is the mission of the physician to safeguard the health of the people. His or her knowledge and conscience 
are dedicated to the fulfillment of this mission.  
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Assembly binds the physician with the words, "The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, 
"A physician shall act only in the patient's interest when providing medical care, which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condi tion of the patient." 
The purpose of biomedical research involving human subjects must be to improve diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic procedures, and the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of disease. 
In current medical practice, most diagnostic, therapeutic or prophylactic procedures involve hazards. This 
applies especially to biomedical research.  
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation involving 
human subjects. 
In the field of biomedical research, a fundamental distinction must be recognized between medical research, 
in which the aim is essentially diagnostic or therapeutic for a patient, and medical research, the essential 
object of which is purely scientific and without implying direct diagnostic or therapeutic value to the person subjected to the research.  
Special caution must be exercised in the conduct of research, which may affect the environment, and the 
welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413345]'s physical and mental integrity, and on the personality of the subject. 
7. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects, unless they are 
satisfied that the hazards involved are believed to be predictable. Physicians should cease any investigation, 
if the hazards are found to outweigh the potential benefits. 
8. In publication of the results of his or her research, the physician is obliged to preserve the accuracy of 
the results. Reports of experimentation, not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration, 
should not be accepted for publication. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_296108], Inc. 
LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413346]'s freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. 
10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project, the physician should be particularly cautious, 
if the subject is in a  dependent relationship to him or her, or may consent under duress. In that case, the 
informed consent should be obtained by a physician, who is not engaged in the investigation, and who is 
completely independent of this official relationship. 
11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal guardian in 
accordance with national legislation. Where physical or mental incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a minor, permission from the responsible relative replaces that of 
the subject, in accordance with national legislation. Whenever the minor child is in fact able to give a 
consent, the minor's consent must be obtained in addition to the consent of the minor's legal guardian. 
12. T he research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved, and 
should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present Declaration are complied with. 
 
II. Medical Research Combined with Clinical Care (Clinical Research)  
 
1. In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to use a new diagnostic and therapeutic 
measure, if, in his or her judgment, it offers hope of saving life, reestablishing health, or alleviating suffering.  
2. The potential benefits , hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed against the advantages 
of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods. 
3. In any medical study, every patient --including those of a control group, if any--  should be assured of the 
best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.  
4. The refusal of the patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the physician- patient 
relationship. 
5. If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons for this proposal 
should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent committee (I.2). 
6. The physician can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition 
of new medical knowledge, only to t he extent that medical research is justified by [CONTACT_334845].

LATERA RCT  Version 3.[ADDRESS_413347]   Page 53 CONFIDENTIAL  III. Non -Therapeutic Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Non -Clinical Biomedical 
Research)  
1. In the purely scientific application of medical research carried out on a human being, it is the duty of the 
physician to remain the protector of the life and health of that person, on whom biomedical research is 
being carried out. 
2. The subjects should be volunteers --either healthy persons, o r patients for whom the experimental design 
is not related to the patient's illness.  
3. The investigator or the investigating team should discontinue the research, if in his/her or their judgment 
it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual.  
4. In re search on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over considerations 
related to the well-being of the subject.

Feasibility Study for Artificial Pancreas Device 
With Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation System 
SDRI/UCSB – IDE G110093  CONFIDENTIAL Page 4 
Supplement #5 
 Contains trade secret and/or confidential information exempt from disclosure under 21 CFR 20.61  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This clinical trial is a feasibility study to assess the performance of an Artificial Pancreas 
(AP) device using the Artificial Pancreas System (APS©) platform for subjects with type 
1 diabetes
 using rapid acting insulin as well as pre-prandial inhaled insulin 
(Te
chnosphere® Insulin Inhalation System by [CONTACT_244220]).  This is a follow-
up stud
y to the approved feasibility study IDE G110093.  The new proposed study and 
IDE G110093 use the same device and follow the same clinical protocol with the addition 
of the pre-prandial inhaled insulin in this new proposed feasibility study.  The CGM for 
this propose
d study is the next generation of Dexcom CGMs, the G4® System which was 
recently approved by [CONTACT_1622].  The goal of this proposed study is to explore the 
fea
sibility of using multiple insulin delivery routes in order to mimic the physiology of 
both 1st and 2nd phase insulin secretion.  The intent is to exploit the rapid action achieved 
b
y inhaled insulin to compensate for part of the meals and utilize the conventional 
subcutaneous route for management of basal insulin and as second phase meal-related 
insulin.  Preliminary analysis of the results of IDE G110093 have been very encouraging 
and a
re supportive of this new proposed study using inhaled insulin to reduce the post-
prandial peak.  The AP device is a closed-loop between a Dexcom® G4 ® System 
(
Dexcom® Incorporated, San Diego, CA) continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and a 
OneTouch® Pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]® Glucose Monitoring System (Animas Corp, Westchester, PA) 
subcutaneous insulin delivery pump (CSII).  The AP device is controlled by a zone-
Model Predictive Control (zone-MPC) algorithm augmented by a safety algorithm named 
the Health Monitoring System (HMS).  The clinical study will include 12 to 20 adults 
subjects aged 21 to 65 years old. 
 
The study consists of an evaluation of the Artificial Pancreas device during a 24-hour 
closed
-loop in a clinic environment (Sansum Diabetes Research Institute, Santa Barbara, 
CA).  The 24-hour period includes: 
 2 unannounced meals (evening dinner and breakfast of 50 g CHO each) preceded 
with a nominal dose of T
echnosphere® inhaled insulin; 
 1 period of 30 minutes of exercise at 50% of the predicted heart rate reserve 
(H
RR) preceded with a snack and followed by a snack 3 hours later (on Day 2); 
 complete night from 12:00 am to 7:00 am; 
The subject will arrive at approximately 4:00 pm to the CRC (clinical research center), 
the closed-loop will be initiated at approximately 4:30 pm that same day and continued 
until 4:30 pm the next day.  A physician will be monitoring the patient with the artificial 
Pancreas (AP) device at all time.

With Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation System 
SDRI/UCSB – IDE G110093  CONFIDENTIAL Page 5 
Supplement #5 
 Contains trade secret and/or confidential information exempt from disclosure under 21 CFR 20.61  The proposed study will evaluate the performance of the AP device combined with 
Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation Powder in predicting the fall and rise of glucose values 
and in re
gulating insulin delivery to mitigate extreme blood glucose variations during the 
following challenges: 
 following unannounced meals,  

 during a nocturnal period, and  

 during a period of active exercise. 
The
 goal is to demonstrate that the AP device is able to maintain the subject blood 
glucose within a safe range at all times.  One of the objectives of the study will be to 
measure the percent of time spent in the following zones: 
 [80-140] mg/dL at all times unless described otherwise 

 [80-140] mg/dL during the nocturnal period 

 [70-180] mg/dL postprandial, for 5 hours following the unannounced meals 

 [70-150] mg/dL during and for 3 hours following exercise 
I
n particular, an analysis will report on 1-hour and 2-hour postprandial glucose level and 
6-hour area-under-the-curve (AUC) when compared to G110093 to evaluate the impact 
of the Te
chnosphere® insulin (only for those subjects who enrolled in both clinical 
studie
s). 
It is anticipated that following the planned challenges, glucose value might increase 
temporarily beyond those ranges.  These excursions will be reviewed and analyzed (value 
and duration) and the study will determine how the AP device mitigates those excursions 
and maintains glucose levels within a safe and acceptable range.  The clinical study will 
also review any event that occurs during the course of the 24-hour closed-loop: 
hy
poglycemic events, hyperglycemic events, outside intervention, other Adverse Event, 
Se
rious Adverse Events, Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect, and device complaints for 
the commercial devices used.  A root cause analysis of the event will be performed to 
determined if it is related to the device or the drug and if the drug, which drug 
(subcutaneous or Technosphere® Insulin).  Safety of the patient will remain the primary 
goal.  The goal of the AP device combined with the Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation 
Powde
r (with Gen2C inhaler) is to operate without outside intervention even when 
cha
llenged by [CONTACT_244221] (HMS).  The subject will just inhale one 10U dose prior to meals.  
This 
is approximately 4U of subcutaneous insulin.  
 
The table below is a synopsis of the proposed clinical protocol.

 Contains trade secret and/or confidential information exempt from disclosure under 21 CFR 20.61  Following the successful screening and informed consent process:  
 
During the week prior to the CRC visit, the  subject will review glucose control and 
insulin pump settings with study staff, with goal to aim for optimal glucose control. 
(Subject’s basal rate settings are used for insulin delivery during closed -loop mode 
when glucose is predicted to be within deter mined glucose zones, and insulin to 
carbohydrate ratios are used in study test meal calculations).  
 
Two to three days prior to the CRC visit, the subject will attend an outpatient visit 
for the insertion, by [CONTACT_464], of two CGM sensors, as well as to r eceive training 
and instructions on how to care for the CGM.  The CGM will be in blinded mode 
during the 2 -3 days as an outpatient.  The Bayer Contour® NEXT EZ blood glucose 
meter will be used for all CGM calibrations.  
 
Two to three days after this sensor insertion visit, the subject will return to the CRC 
for approximately [ADDRESS_297128] will arrive at approximately 4:[ADDRESS_297129]’s blood glucose is greater than 25 0 mg/dL at arrival to the clinic, the 
study will be reschedule d.  All times are +/ - 30 minutes.  
 Closed -loop will start at approximately 4:30 pm.  
 A small evening meal (~50g CHO) will be given at approximately  6:30 pm 
without announcing it to the device, i.e. without providing any information 
to the device.   The meal will be preceded by [CONTACT_17801] a  single  dose of 
Technosphere® Insulin (10U) using the Gen2 C inhaler.  
 Night time will be from approximately 12:00 am to 7:00 am.  
 Another small meal (~ 50 g CHO) will be given for breakfast at 
approximately 7:00 am.   The meal will be preceded by [CONTACT_17801] a 
single dose of Technosphere® Insulin (10U) using the Gen2 C inhaler.  
 At 11:[ADDRESS_297130] will be given a snack (~16 g CHO) and start 
exercise.  
 The subject will exercise for 30 minutes at 50% of his/her target heart rate.  
 At approximately 2:[ADDRESS_297131] will be given another snack (~16 g 
CHO).  
 At around 4:30 pm, i.e. 24 hrs after starting, closed -loop will end.  
 
During the CRC visit, all diabetes care and use of the AP device will be the 
responsibility of the investigator.  The insulin brand  (subcutaneous)  used during the 
CRC session will be the same as the brand used by [CONTACT_423].  Technosphere ® 
Insulin will be delivered using the 10U Gen2C cartridge per the Investigator’s 
Brochure manufacturer’s instructions.  A detailed plan for diabetes monitoring and 
for responding to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be in place as described by 
[CONTACT_244224].  Subject will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_244225].  A physician will be present at all time.  
 
The CGM will be calibrated as required by [CONTACT_3455], as well as 
approximately [ADDRESS_297132] every 30 minutes.  More frequent 
monitoring may be performed as defined in the protocol to ensure the safety of the 
patient.   
Each tim e a YSI measurement will be taken, a finger stick measurement using the 
CONTOUR® NEXT EZ blood glucose monitoring system will be performed to

Supplement #5 
 Contains trade secret and/or confidential information exempt from disclosure under [ADDRESS_297136] of this application is an Artificial Pancreas device also referred to as 
the AP device.  The AP device is intended for use in people with type 1 diabetes 
and is 
designed to automatically deliver insulin using a commercially available 
insulin pump and to continuously monitor subcutaneous glucose levels using a 
commercially available continuous glucose monitor (CGM).  The AP device is 
intended to adjust insulin doses only when glucose concentration is, or is 
predicted to be, outside the specified zone [80-140] mg/dL.  It includes a 
redundant safety control that will send warnings of impending hypoglycemia 
and recommend eating carbohydrates immediately to prevent hypoglycemia.  
The Artificial Pancreas device is a closed-loop system linking a subcutaneous 
Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) and a subcutaneous insulin delivery pump, 
which is controlled by [CONTACT_244227].  The device incorporates a Model 
Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm and a Health Monitoring System (HMS) as 
an additional safety feature.  The AP device is augmented with the use of the 
Tec
hnosphere® Insulin Inhalation System (Gen2) that will deliver a fix amount 
of ultra-rapid-acting insulin whose absorption and exposure times are similar to 
that observed in normal physiology.  The inhaled insulin will only be used prior 
to a meal to mimic phase [ADDRESS_297137]-prandial 
peak.  The powdered insulin is currently under review (Phase III of IND 61,729) 
 
The AP device is composed of: 
 Artificial Pancreas System (APS©) platform from the University of

Supplement #5 
 Contains trade secret and/or confidential information exempt from disclosure under 21 CFR 20.61  1.2. Continuous glucose monitor (CGM) 
The Dexcom® G4 ® System Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) has been 
approv
ed by [CONTACT_244229] P050012 (S045 on 8/17/2012) and has not been 
modifie
d.  An additional software, the Dexcom G4® Receiver Tool DevKit 
software
 has been installed on the study laptop to interface with the APS© 
platform.
 
The CGM unit consists of an interstitial glucose sensor, inserted under the skin 
of the abdomen into the fatty tissue.  An applicator with a removable needle is 
used to insert the sensor.  The process of insertion is similar to the insertion of 
an insulin infusion set.  The sensor is held in place by [CONTACT_244230], and a small 
transmitter is snapped into place over the sensor.  The transmitter communicates 
every 5 minutes by [CONTACT_244231] a hand-held receiver.  During the CRC 
phase of the study, the receiver is connected to the laptop computer to provide 
the glucos
e information to the algorithms: zone MPC and HMS.  The CGM will 
require calibration with a fingerstick blood glucose value as stipulated by [CONTACT_13989]’s instructions as well as before meals and bedtime.  The purpose is 
to ensure
 the most accurate sensor value for the study to understand the 
effectiveness of the control algorithm.  In this study the calibration will be 
performed with the CONTOUR® NEXT EZ blood glucose meter (commercially 
available, unmodified product k111268).  In order to minimize the risk of 
ca
ncellation of the clinical study due to a sensor problem, the subject will wear 
two sensors, and at the time of the CRC stay, the investigator will select which 
sensor to use, and document the rationale, as noted in the procedure section.  
This will be done before the start of the 24-hour closed-loop.  Should the 
selected CGM fail during the CRC visit, the investigator will be able to switch 
to the backup CGM and continue the study, and will document the reason and 
impact of the change. 
1.3. Insulin pump 
The insulin pump used in this clinical study may be the OneTouch® Pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]® 
insulin pum
p with modified Meter-Remote or the OmniPod™ Insulin 
Manag
ement System with the modified Insulet Personal Diabetes Manager 
(PDM).  The pump delivers insulin subcutaneously through an infusion set, in 
this study the Inset® 30 infusion set.  The OneTouch® Pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]® insulin pump is 
not modified and has received 510k clearance (K080639).  Only the Meter-
Re
mote software has been modified to allow the algorithm to send commands 
from the APS© platform to the insulin pump by [CONTACT_244232]-
Remote.  The Meter-Remote is connected by [CONTACT_244233]® Pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]® insulin pump by [CONTACT_148148].  The

will be used for CGM calibrations.).  The OmniPod™ Insulin Management 
sy
stem had not been modified and has received 510(k) clearance (K042792).  
Only the Insulet PDM has been modified to communicate with the APS® 
platform.  Both insulin delivery systems, the OneTouch® Pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]® and the 
OmniPod™,
 have been validated as components working with the APS® 
infra
structure (MAF-1625). 
1.4. Control algorithm 
The control algorithm is unique to this application: it combines a zone-Model 
Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm with the added safety feature of the Health 
Monitoring System (HMS) which provides warnings and notifications of 
impending hypoglycemia to request outside intervention, such as absorption of 
fast acting glucose.  The notification is not only available to the subject via the 
AP device, but also to the physician or another person who could be located 
remotely in the future (this IDE exclusively takes place in the clinical research 
setting in presence of a physician).  The HMS algorithm uses the same CGM 
data as the zone-MPC control algorithm but utilizes a separate algorithm for 
trending and predictions of future glucose values.  Using a redundant and 
independe
nt algorithm is an important safety feature of the overall AP device.  
The HMS will send a warning to the AP device and a text message to the 
attending physician (present at all times) whenever it predicts a glucose value 
below 70 mg/dL within the next [ADDRESS_297138] be acknowledged for the pop-up window to close.  The 
acknowledgement gives the choice to “accept” or “ignore” the warning and 
rec
ommendation. 
The zone-MPC control algorithm is at its core a Model Predictive Control 
(MPC), which incorporates an explicit model of human T1DM glucose-insulin 
dynamics.  The model is used to predict future glucose values and to calculate 
future controller moves that will bring the glucose profile into the desired range.  
Software constraints ensure that insulin delivery rates are constrained between 
minimum and maximum values.  The first insulin infusion (out of n steps) is 
then implemented.  At the next time step, k +1, the process is repeated based on 
the new measured glucose value and the last insulin rate.  The algorithm adjusts 
insulin delivery automatically to achieve and maintain the patient’s glucose level 
within a predetermined safe range: 80-140 mg/dL.  The only variable that may 
be a
djusted between subjects is the responsiveness factor  which is the ration of 
Q/R.  It can be described as the agility of the control algorithm to respond to

rati
o of 1:12, 1:15 and 1:50 (from most responsive to least responsive).  The 
default
 setting is considered to be the nominal ratio of Q/R of 1:15.  The first 
subje
ct will be evaluated using that setting.  Then, following results from each 
subject, if results show ed poor glucose control, as defined by [CONTACT_244234], in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
the responsi
veness factor  may be adjusted to the most agile setting of 1:[ADDRESS_297139] c
onservative setting of 1:[ADDRESS_297140].  This will be a clinical decision to add to the overall safety of the 
study
.  All changes of the responsiveness factor  between subjects and their 
justifications will be documented. 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1. Study’s challenges 
The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the performance of the AP 
device while the subject is under close clinical supervision in a Clinical 
Research Center (CRC) setting.  The assessment will take place over a 
continuous 24-hour closed-loop period with three types of challenges: 
 Unannounced meals 
The
 purpose of this challenge is to evaluate the performance of the AP device 
to safe
ly regulate the glucose level when the subject has an unannounced 
meal.  In other words, it will determine whether the AP device auto-regulates 
insulin deliver
y following the meal and keeps the glucose concentration of the 
subject within the range [70-180] mg/dL for most of the 5 hours following the 
meal. 
 Overnight glucose control  
The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate the performance of AP device 
during the ni
ght.  It will determine whether the AP device will safety regulate 
the glucos
e concentrations of the subject during the night, i.e. if the glucose 
concentrations will remain within the [80-140] mg/dL range during sleep. 
 Exercise 
The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate the performance of the AP device 
when the subje
ct is exercising.  The goal is to determine whether the AP 
device can maintain a safe glucose range or whether there is a need for an

period.  The analysis will determine if glucose level remains within the [70-
150] mg/dL range during exercise and for most of the 3 hours following 
exercise. 
2.2. Primary and secondary endpoints 
The assessment of the performance of the device will be based principally on two 
types of metrics: 
 Primary endpoints: percentage of time spent within a specific zone, in 
pa
rticular the desired zone [80-140] mg/dL.  Other zones will be defined 
after meal or exercises. 
 Secondary endpoints: review of the extremes of the glucose values of the 
subj
ect, duration of those extremes and the review of any event requiring 
outside intervention to treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. 
 
The primary endpoint  of the clinical study is the amount of time spent within a 
specified glucose target range.  In this study there will be different ranges 
depending on both time of day and time after meals and exercise: 
 Target range (unless described otherwise): [80-140] mg /dL 
 Overnight target range: [80-140] mg/dL 

 5 hours postprandial target range: [70-180] mg/dL 

 During exercise: [70-150] mg/dL 

 [ADDRESS_297141]-exercise: [70-150] mg/dL 
 
T
he secondary endpoints  of the clinical study include excursions outside the 
ran
ge, the maximum value of the excursion, the duration the subject remains 
outside of the target ranges and whether or not there is any outside intervention to 
treat hypo- or hyperglycemia.  The extremes are defined as follows: 
 For hyperglycemia: any blood glucose value >400 mg/dL (measured by 
[CONTACT_244235]
I)  
 For hypoglycemia: any blood glucose value <60 mg/dL (measured by 
[CONTACT_244235]
I) 
In addition, a secondary end-point will consist in analyzing CGM values that were 
trending beyond the desirable ranges.  The analysis will determine the percent of 
time spent in the following zones:


 If glucose value per CGM is ≤70 mg/dL;

The
 secondary endpoints will also be assessed by [CONTACT_244236].  
The levels of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia are described by [CONTACT_50489] 15–2Table

3. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
3.1. Ethical background 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 
(1964), including all amendments, International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICG), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and relevant local laws and 
regulations. 
The final protocol and informed consent form will be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_244237] (Santa Barbara, CA) Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
(IRB #10-36) following the approval of this IDE by [CONTACT_244238].  Any changes to the clinical protocol will be 
communicated to the FDA and the IRB as required by [CONTACT_50342].  Periodic 
and final study reports will be communicated to both FDA and IRB.  The 
investigator will report Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) and 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) to both the FDA and IRB per reporting 
requirements. 
Each subject will be provided with oral and written information describing the 
nature and duration of the study.  Prior to initiation of any study-related 
procedures, the subject will sign and date a written informed consent to 
participate in the study and will also sign and date, if separate, the authorization 
form required under HIPAA, authorizing the use and disclosure of the subject’s 
protected health information.  The signed original informed consent form (ICF) 
and HIPAA authorization form will be retained with the study center’s records 
and each subject will receive a copy of each form he/she has signed.  The 
subject will also sign the [LOCATION_004] Bill of Rights.  The investigator must be 
satisfied that the subject has understood the information provided before written 
consent is obtained.  The original informed consent documentation must be 
made available for inspection by [CONTACT_093].  Documentation of the 
informed consent form process will be available in the subject’s source

methods.  The known r
isks are: 
 Hyper and hypoglycemia brought on by [CONTACT_244239]. 
 Weight gain or loss may be caused by [CONTACT_244240]. 
 Using the CGM or insulin pump:  risk of bruising, infection, pain and/or 
bleeding
 at the site of insertion and skin site reaction to adhesive. 
 Blood sampling with finger stick: minor discomfort and risk of infection at 
sit
e of finger stick. 
 Blood sampling with a needle: risk of infection at site of venipuncture, 
fa
inting, bruising, formation of a blood clot, pain and/or bleeding at the site 
of venipuncture. 
 On rare occasions, the continuous glucose sensor may break and leave a 
small portion of the sensor under the skin that may cause redness, swelling, 
or pain at the insertion site. 
 On rare occasions, heart or lung problem identified during the exercise test. 
How
ever, the benefits of the study are multiple.  Results will support moving 
one step closer toward a future portable autonomous artificial pancreas for type 
[ADDRESS_297143] using the APS© platform 
and other types of algorithms.  Using a subcutaneous glucose sensor and a 
subcutaneous insulin delivery method presents the advantage of using 
currently available and proven technology, while expanding the intended

nocturnal hypoglycemia.   
3.3.2. Necessary future development 
F
uture studies need to be designed to address larger challenges of 
unannounced food intakes as well as situations when the patient is under 
stress or exercising.  Generally, additional studies are necessary to identify 
and optimize control algorithms.  Those algorithms, tailored to be optimal 
for each patient will need to include multiple layers of safety mechanisms 
to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.  Eventually, it is also 
desirable to expand the testing to offer a choice of CGMs and insulin 
delivery pumps to give flexibility to the patient. 
3.3.3. Overview of recent results: IDE G090129 
I
DE G090129 sponsored by [CONTACT_244241] (SDRI) was approved by [CONTACT_244242] 2010.  The study of 10 
subjects evaluated the performance of a closed-loop artificial pancreas 
using the APS© platform with the Dexcom® SEVEN® PLUS (Dexcom®, 
Sa
n Diego, CA) CGM, the OmniPod™ (Insulet Corp, Bedford, MA) 
insulin delivery pump and the mpMPC control algorithm and IOB 
(insulin-on-board) constraints.  The control algorithm of that study was a 
control
-to-target Model Predictive Control algorithm, i.e. the target was 
110 ± 30 mg/dL.  The algorithm was also referred to as mpMPC with IOB 
constraints.  The algorithm was customized for each patient based on data 
collected during [ADDRESS_297145] at the Sansum Diabetes Research Institute (Santa Barbara, 
CA).  The first subject underwent closed loop in August 2010.  To-date,

(Schneider Children’s Medical Center).  Glucose control of twelve 
subjects was automated using the closed-loop system for a period of 
approximately 6 hours.  During that time, the system was challenged with 
an unannounced meal of 30 to 40 g of carbohydrate after a starting point 
of low to mild hyperglycemia (180-250 mg/dL).  Results showed that 
glucose level was maintained with the safe range of [80-180] mg/dL 70% 
of the times and the low and high blood glucose indices were 0.12 and 6.9 
respectively.  No hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_197590].  Severe

correction bolus.  All procedures for glucose rescue were followed.  The 
HMS was triggered an additional 3 times over the next 2 hours.  YSI nadir 
was 44 mg/dL with mild symptoms of hypoglycemia.  The admission was

Figure 3–4: CVGA during overnight period (midnight to 7:00 am)  
Over the
 24-hour closed-loop period when the AP device monitored 
glucose level and automatically delivered insulin, for 81% of the time by 
[CONTACT_28569], the glucose level was within [70-180] mg/dL range: this included a 
nocturnal period, 2 meals and an exercise period. 
When excluding the periods following the meals and exercise segment, the 
total time spent within the [70-180] mg/dL zone increased to 92% when 
measure
d by [CONTACT_28569].  Most frequently, when following a meal, the glucose 
level increased.  During the 5-hours following each meal, the subjects 
spent on average 63-72% in the zone [70-180] mg/dL while they spent 
89% in t
hat same zone during the 3-hours following the 30-minutes 
exercise segment at moderate intensity.   The control of the AP device 
during the nocturnal period was particularly effective as, on average, the 
subjects spent 92% of their time within the zone [70-180] mg/dl, 70% of 
the time within the narrower zone [80-140] mg/dL and 0% below 70 
g/mL.  A summary of the nocturnal results is illustrated by [CONTACT_244246] ( Figure 
3–4) where all data points are within the A and B zones. 
The
 actual profile from each subject will vary due to multiple factors 
including the initial glucose level and initial slope (trend) of each subject.  
However, in summary, the data showed that when measured by [CONTACT_244247], the glucose level of the subject was in control the majority of the

glucose level) or beginning of the exercise (decrease of glucose level) to 
start reacting and anticipating further glucose increase and decrease and to 
adjust insulin delivery above or below basal levels accordingly.   The 
redundant safety alert system (HMS) effectively requested ingestion of 
CHO when predicting hypoglycemia.  Those recommendations were 
followed and hypoglycemia was avoided. 
With those early results, the AP device showed that, for the evening and 
breakfast meals, it was able to detect the meal and prevent excessive post-
prandial peaks and maintained the glucose level within a safe range.  
The glucose level during and after the exercise period has a different 
profile for each subject because of the difference in the trend preceding the 
exercise session.  There was no hypoglycemic event or HMS alert during 
the exercise period 
In conclusions, this preliminary analysis of the results showed that the AP 
device is able to detect meals and react appropriately to prevent excessive 
post-prandial peaks.  It also works effectively in anticipating risks of 
hypoglycemia and alerting the physician / subject to ingest carbohydrate.  
The redundant safety mechanism functioned as anticipated.  
Because of the post-prandial peak, the new clinical study is proposing to 
use a dose of Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation Powder at the beginning 
of each meal.  TI is a very fast acting insulin.  It is anticipated that the TI 
will mimic the early phase of prandial insulin hence, will reduce the post-
prandial peak.  This will allow the AP device to operate more effectively 
as a regulator of glucose level using subcutaneous delivery of insulin.  
Besides the added TI dose at the beginning of each meal, the clinical 
design will remain exactly the same (only the meal size of the breakfast 
will be
 increased to 50 g of CHO to be the same as the evening meal).

Indians comprising less than ten percent of the population.  Because type 1 
diabetes disproportionately afflicts the Northern European population and is rare 
among Latinos of Mexican descent, it is not expected that minorities or non-
English speaking subjects will be enrolled.  Subjects will be recruited using th e 
Sansum Diabetes Research Institute database of patients.   
It is expected that the ratio of men to women will be close to 1:1. 
The population studies in this clinical trial eligible is adults aged 21-[ADDRESS_297154] at the Sansum Diabetes Research 
Institute (SDRI).  Informed consent will be obtained before the study procedures 
are conducted. 
9.2. Literature data references 
The current treatment method for insulin-dependent diabetic patients requires 
either multiple daily subcutaneous insulin injections or continuous subcutaneous 
insulin injection via a pump.  Both treatment modes necessitate frequent blood 
glucose measurements in order to determine the daily insulin requirements for 
maintaining euglycemia.  Because such frequent monitoring involves patient 
discomfort and is very time consuming, few patients are able to maintain their 
levels of glucose consistently within a safe range.  Mounting evidence suggests 
that euglycemia is necessary to prevent the complications of diabetes.  As a 
result, being able to develop an automated glucose monitoring and insulin 
delivery system has been considered a key priority for improving the life of 
patients with type [ADDRESS_297155] reported results of closed-loop

The detailed review of those studies can be found in the IDE submission related 
to this clinical protocol.   
Some of the studies used insulin only or insulin combined with glucagon. 
Insulin was most often delivered subcutaneously, but also intra-peritoneally, 
many types of control algorithms were used (proportional-integral-derivative, 
fuzzy logic, model predictive control, hypoglycemic prediction, modified linear 
prediction, Kalman filtering, adaptive hybrid infinite impulse response filter, 
statistical prediction and numerical logical) and studies were performed on 
children or adults.   
Overall, each automated closed-loop system managed to maintain safer levels of 
glucose levels than a non-automated system.  The variety of types of algorithms 
being evaluated indicates how active this field of research is.  It also indicates 
that the algorithm that will be most effective and safe for the physiology of a 
wide range of patients has not been identified yet.  The answer will likely 
consist in using a combination of algorithms.  So far, all controlling algorithms 
showed that they were able to bring glucose level to a safe range and prevent or 
at least reduce the number of hyper and hypoglycemic events.

on the CGM receiver.   
Calibration of the CGM will be performed using CONTOUR® NEXT EZ Blood 
Glucose
 meter and strips.  Study personnel will perform the Quality Control 
(QC) procedure to check that the glucose meter is working properly.  The QC 
procedure will use the two Control Solutions (low and high).  The results from 
each control solution must be within the acceptable range indicated by [CONTACT_244251]. This meter and strips will be given to the subject to perform 
all required calibrations of the CGM.  
CGM calibration will be performed according to manufacturer’s instructions and 
before meals and bedtime.  In addition to the Dexcom® G4 ® Blinded Mode 
Use
r Guide, the subject will be given an instruction sheet called “Subject 
Blinded CGM Instruction Sheet” on how to perform calibration of the CGM 
during the outpatient phase.  During the outpatient phase of the trial, the subject 
will use
 his/her own CGM if using one, and his/her own insulin delivery pump.  
The subject will rely on finger stick blood values for insulin delivery settings 
and bolus amounts. The subject will be instructed to perform finger-sticks at 
least four times per day for both routine care and for device calibration.  Glucose 
values for calibration should be taken when glucose values are not changing 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], e.g. before meals.   
During the outpatient phase of the study, the patient will be encouraged to 
contact [CONTACT_244252]/she ma
y have.  Should there be any event of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, 
the subject would contact [CONTACT_244253].  This may include delaying or excluding the 
patient from the closed-loop phase of the trial.   
Subject will be instructed to bring to CRC visit all diabetes care and insulin 
pump supplies, although subject will use study-provided rapid acting insulin (of 
same brand used by [CONTACT_1130]) during CRC visit.  Subject will be instructed to 
charge the CGM units overnight on the night prior to the CRC visit. 
If the subject is using CGM at time of enrollment, the subject will not use their 
own CGM device from the time of study CGM insertion until the time of 
discharge from the CRC visit. 
In case of illness or cancellation, the visits may be rescheduled at the discretion 
of the investigator.

 Arrival 
The
 subject will arrive to the CRC center at approximately [ADDRESS_297165]’s blood glucose is greater than 250 mg/dL when they arrive at the 
CRC, then, the clinical study will be rescheduled.  If the subject is female 
of c
hild bearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed on 
arrival to the CRC to verify that she is not pregnant.  The investigator will 
also check for any changes in health since the screening visit and the 
insertion of the CGM.  The investigator will determine if any reported 
health changes may have an impact on the enrollment status of the subject.  
The subject will already be wearing two CGMs for the study set to blinded 
mode.  Upon arrival, the study staff will unblind both CGMs.  The study 
staff will also perform the Quality Control process on the glucose meter 
(OneTouch® Ultra®) using two control solutions.  The day of the trial, the 
infusion set of the OneTouch® Pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]® Glucose Management System with 
modified meter remote CSII will be inserted subcutaneously.  They will be 
inserted into the abdomen using a non-hypertrophied area, as clinically 
determine by [CONTACT_093].  The pump and its modified meter remote 
will have been paired and verified by [CONTACT_3455], i.e. Animas®

Supplement #5 
 Contains trade secret and/or confidential information exempt from disclosure under [ADDRESS_297166].  A full new cartridge of insulin will be used for the closed-
loop phase (same brand as the one normally used by [CONTACT_423]). 
An indwelling catheter will be put in place for frequent blood glucose 
monitoring and for the rapid administration of intravenous glucose if 
necessary.  No heparin and / or heparin lock will be used during the study.   
The investigator determines which one of the two CGM devices will be 
used in t
he trial and documents the rationale for the decision.  For 
example, the most accurate CGM may be used, and may be determined by 
[CONTACT_244254] a meter glucose value performed at the 
time.  The second CGM is considered a mitigation factor, a back-up in 
case the first CGM ceases to function properly during the trial.  During the 
study, the physician may switch to using the alternate CGM if there was a 
problem with the radiofrequency communication or any other 
abnormalities affecting the output of the CGM.  The rationale for selecting 
either one of the CGMs to start the trial will be documented on the CRF.  
If a CGM has to be switched, the change will be documented and 
explained.  If both CGMs were performing equally, either one of them 
may be selected.  If both CGMs were to cease to function, the clinical trial 
for the subject would be terminated and the investigator will determine 
whether it will be rescheduled. 
Blood finger stick is performed using the CONTOUR® NEXT EZ Blood 
Glucose
 meter and strips. 
Once all connections have been verified, the subject will be disconnected 
from his/her insulin pump and will be connected to the AP device.  The 
AP devic

of hypoglycemia, the blood glucose level will be measured with 
YSI and hypoglycemia guidelines will be followed.  The YSI will 
be use
d according to manufacturer’s instructions and operated by 
[CONTACT_3665].  The YSI will be checked a minimum of every 
2 hours with the 180 mg/dL standard and recalibrated if YSI 
glucose standard reads outside the range of 177-183 mg/dL or as 
needed.  All plasma glucose samples will be read on 2 membranes 
and discrepancies in values that exceed 5 mg/dL will be called to 
attention of the study physician to assess the need for immediate 
recalibration.  
Each time a YSI measurement is taken, a finger stick measurement 
using the CONTOUR® EZ blood glucose monitoring system will 
be taken for information. 
Calibration of the CGM will be performed with a finger stick with 
the CONTOUR® NEXT EZ glucose meter.  On the day of CGM 
insertion and at the beginning of the CRC visit, QC testing of the 
standard solution specific to the CONTOUR® NEXT EZ glucose 
meter will be performed.  QC may be repeated any time there is a 
question about the glucose result from the meter.  The labeling of 
the commercially available standard solution can be found in 
Appendix [ADDRESS_297169] two different concentrations of control 
solution, including a concentration in the hypoglycemic range if 
the manufacturer provides one.  A glucose meter will not be used 
in a study if it does not read within the target range at each

application; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
15.2.4. Device complaints 
Those
 only apply to the approved devices used in the AP device, i.e. the 
CGM and the insulin pump.  Those devices are not being used as they 
were intended to be used.  Effectively, these devices are being used 
beyond their original intended use when included in a closed-loop.  
However, their intended output and performance specifications are not 
being modified: the purpose of the CGM in the closed-loop is still to 
provide subcutaneous glucose values, while the purpose of the pump in the 
closed-loop is still to deliver controlled amount of insulin.  A device 
complaint also applies to CONTOUR® NEXT EZ Glucose meter used to 
calibrate the CGM.  It is used per the manufacturer’s instructions. 
A complaint means any written, electronic or oral communication that 
alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, 
safety, effectiveness, or performance of a device after it is released for 
distribution.  The complaint may or may not be associated with an adverse 
event. 
Should there be any malfunction of the device related to the original 
intended use for which the device is marketed for, it will be reported to the 
manufacturer per 21 CFR 803.3.  For example, problems with the infusion 
set (Inset®), or the subcutaneous needle would be independent of the 
closed-loop trial and will be reported. 
Because both Dexcom® and Animas are close partners in the development 
of an a
rtificial pancreas, they will informally be notified of any other 
malfunction of their device related to their use in the AP device.  This will

15.2.5. Anticipated adverse events 
Ea
ch adverse event is graded for its severity from mild to severe as 
described by [CONTACT_50489] 15 –1Table 9–1 .  This is a measure of intensity only.  
An adverse event may be severe, but not clinically serious. 
Table 15–1: Severity of adverse events 
Intensity level  Description  
Mild  Usually transient, requires no special treatments, and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities  
Moderate  Usually causes a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
subject and may interfere with daily activities, but is usually 
ameliorate by [CONTACT_14212].  
Severe  Interrupts a subject’s usual daily activities and generally requires 
system drug therapy or other treatment.  
 
Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are intrinsic risks and adverse events 
associated with type 1 diabetes.  The level of severity of such events 
follows a more detailed description as described by [CONTACT_50489] 15–2Table 9–2 : 
it varies from negligible, mild, moderate, severe and very severe.  Only 
hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia that is rated moderate or worse will be 
documented in a CRF.

Adverse event  Description  
Hypoglycemia  Refer to details in Table [ADDRESS_297207], and appropriate medical 
intervention will be made to address any adverse event.   
All adverse events will be recorded on the CRF (Appendix 9 of the IDE), 
including those tha
t may have occurred during the outpatient phase of the trial 
(the investigator will elicit reports of adverse events from the subject).   
In case of a Serious Adverse Event, the study will be put on hold until a thorough 
investigation is performed and documented to determine the root cause of the 
event.  Based on the results, the Sponsor/investigator will determine appropriate 
action, including changes to the protocol or termination of the study, and notify 
the approp

Intensit
y:  The intensity of the adverse event will be recorded based on Table 15–
1Table 9 –1.  The term severe is a measure of intensity, not clinical severity.  A 
severe AE is not necessarily a serious AE.  For example, itching for several days 
may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious. 
Causality:  The study investigator will assess the relationship of any adverse 
event to be related or unrelated to participation in the protocol by [CONTACT_244269]® Insulin Inhalation System

determined or until no further change in the condition is expected.  
16. DATA ANALYSIS 
16.1. Overview 
This section presents the statistical analysis that will be used to evaluate the 
primary and secondary end-points of the non-randomized feasibility study.  
These are based on CGM data.  The primary endpoints consist in measuring the 
percentage of time the glucose level of the subject is in the safe zone [80-140] 
mg/dL, including overnight and excluding [ADDRESS_297209]-exercise.  The expected glucose levels during those 
periods are: 
 5 hours postprandial: [70-180] mg/dL 

 During exercise and for 3 hours after exercise: [70-150] mg/dL 
The
 secondary endpoints consist in measuring the glucose extremes and the 
need for outside intervention to address hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.  The 
restoration of glucose level to a safe range, i.e. within [80-140] mg/dL after the 
two unannounced meals and the exercise without the need of intervention to 
addre
ss hypo- or hyperglycemia, i.e. no physician override to inject insulin or 
give carbohydrate to the subject, will be considered a successful outcome.   
If outside intervention is the result of notification from the Health Monitoring 
System algorithm (HMS), then it will be considered a successful outcome as 
well. 
There is no control group since the patient is his/her own control.  In addition, a 
more re
fined data analysis will be performed as discussed below. 
16.2. Control Variability Grid Analysis 
The overall performance of the control algorithm will be visualized via the 
Control Variability Grid Analysis (CVGA), which is built on a mix/max plot of 
glucose values.  For each subject , a point is plotted with the X-coordinate 
define
d as the minimum blood glucose and the Y-coordinate defined as the 
maximum blood glucose level for an observation period.  In this trial, the

With Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation System 
SDRI/UCSB – IDE G110093  CONFIDENTIAL Page 60 
Supplement #5 
 Contains trade secret and/or confidential information exempt from disclosure under [ADDRESS_297210] sensor errors, the minimum glucose level is set at the 2.5th 
percentile and the maximum glucose level is set at the 97.5th percentile of the 
glucose level distribution, in other words, the Y-X coordinate difference 
corresponds to the 95% spread of the observed distribution.  The plot is then 
split into zones defined by [CONTACT_2030] X and Y coordinate ranges as follows.  The 
zones are color coded to facilitate the visual interpretation of the results:  
 the green zone is safe and acceptable,  

 the orange/yellow zone is not desirable, and  

 the red-zone would be considered failure of the safety of the Artificial  
P
ancreas device.   
Numerically, the information contained in the CVGA, can be described as the 
percentages within each zone.  For example, in Figure 3–1Figure 3–1  which 
present the preliminary results of IDE G090129, there were 40% of the data 
points in zone A, 60% in zone B and 0% in zones C or D.  In other words, the 
CVGA can be interpreted as a display of event-based clinical characteristics of 
the control al
gorithm.  Table 16–1Table 10–1  shows the interpretation of the 
various zones in the CVGA representation.

maintaining within-zone CGM measurements? 
(2) Did the algorithm deliver reasonable size insulin amounts?  Did the algorithm 
deliver the basal amount of insulin in quiescent, within-zone period?  When 
CGM measurements were predicting values higher than the upper zone limit 
of [80-140] mg/dL, did the algorithm increase insulin infusion?  When CGM 
measurements predicted values lower than the lower zone limit of [80-140] 
mg/dL, did the algorithm decrease insulin infusion? After glucose excursion 
above the upper zone limit or below the lower zone limit, when the CGM

algorithm resume the basal amount of insulin infusion? 
(3) When prediction of BG glucose was to be <70 mg/dL in the following 15 
minutes, did the HMS send a warning text to physician?  Did the HMS system 
send unnecessary warning text messages when the BG was not predicted to be 
<70 mg/dL?  Did the investigator need to give CHO to the subject without 
receiving notification from the HMS either because of CGM failure or HMS 
system failure?

16.4.1.  Analyses 
In addition to the qualitative evaluation of the performance of the AP 
device, the percentage of time spent in each zone, and the visual 
evaluation provided by [CONTACT_244270], other quantitative measures will be 
reported, analyzed and interpreted.  They are presented in Table 16–

Data will be presented in table or graphs or both.  Data of all subjects may 
be pooled together or may be presented individually.  Should it be 
warranted, data may also be pooled in different sub-groups. 
16.4.2. Details for calculations 
Inte
r-quartile range (IQR):   I t is a measure of the glucose variability.  It is 
more appropriate than the glucose standard deviation because the glucose 
distribution is highly asymmetric; the hypoglycemic range is numerically 
narrower than the hyperglycemic range, so the distribution of the glucose 
values of a subject is typi[INVESTIGATOR_244216].  The standard deviation of glucose 
values would be predominantly influenced by [CONTACT_244271].  Therefore, the inter-quartile 
range will be calculated.  It is also called the mid-spread or middle fifty.  It 
is a statistical dispersion being equal to the difference between the third 
and first quartile.  It is a robust statistic. 
IQR = Q a – Q 1      (1)

Supplement #5 
 Contains trade secret and/or confidential information exempt from disclosure under 21 CFR 20.61  Where: Q 3 is the 75th percentile and Q 1 is the 25th percentile 
 
Risk index (LBGI and HBGI):  In order to capture the glucose variability 
and its associated risks for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, the low 
blood glucose index (LBGI) and high blood glucose index (HBGI) will be 
calculated as follows: 
Compute (2):  
f(BG
) = 1.509 x [(ln(BG)) 1.084 – 5.381]     (2) 
The B
G risk function is r(BG) using equation (3):  
r(BG) = 10 x f(BG)2          (3) 
The left and right branches are separated as described by (4) and (5):  
rl(BG) = r(BG)   if f(BG) < 0 and    0 otherwise    (4)  
rh(BG) = r(BG)   if f(BG) > 0 and   0 otherwise     (5) 
Given a series of CGM readings BG 1, BG 2, ….BG n, the Low and High BG 
indices (LBGI and HBGI) are computed as the average of rl(BG) and 
rh(BG) respectively. 
 
 
The BG risk index is then defined as: 
BGRI = LBGI + HBGI        (8) 
In 
essence, the LBGI and the HBGI split the overall glucose variation into 
two independent sections related to excursions into hypo- and 
hyperglycemia, and at the same time equalize the amplitude of these 
excursions with respect to the risk they carry.

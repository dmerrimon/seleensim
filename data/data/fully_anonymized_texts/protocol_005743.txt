3. Introductory Statement: This Phase 2 clinical trial , ViDAS-2, will determine if daily  oral vitamin D can reduce 
the risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565149]- cell disease.  Sickle-cell disease, an orphan disease 
affecting an estimated 100,000 individuals in the [LOCATION_002],1, 2 is an inherited red blood cell disorder with 
acute vaso -occlusive complications and chronic multi -organ damage resulting from hemolysis -induced 
endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy.3, 4 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_565150] .5, 6 Our earlier ViDAS-1 clinical trial provided evidence that monthly  bolus  oral vitamin D 3 supplementation 
in children with sickle cell disease reduced the annual rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565151] 50% but 
only after a year of treatment and with no significant difference between vitamin D [ADDRESS_742228]- (12,000 
IU/mo) or high- (100,000 IU/mo) dose therapy (Figure 1). The observed reductions are both statistically 
significant (P<0.0001) and clinically important. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_565152] . 
 
Figure 1: Annual rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (infections, exacerbations of asthma, and the acute chest syndrome)  
in children with sickle cell disease treated with no supplementation during a baseline year and monthly oral doses 
of vitamin D [ADDRESS_742229]- nor high-dose treatments would produce sustained increases in circulating vitamin D 3, 
potentially explaining the uniformity of response to the two treatments. Apparently , a year of treatment with bolus 
dosing was needed to permit sufficient amounts of vitamin D3 to accumulate within cells of the immune system 
and produce the observed reductions in the rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]. Our hypothesis is that daily  oral vitamin 
D3 will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_565153] 1. We propose a 2- year controlled, double-
blind , randomized Phase 2 clinical trial comparing the efficacy  in reducing the rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565154] -
cell disease of daily  oral vitamin D 3 (3,333 IU/d) with monthly bolus  oral vitamin D 3, (100,000 IU/mo ) as a control. 
Baseline concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in our population (mean ~14 ng/mL) guide the choice of the high-dose daily treatment for the proposed trial  and are too low to permit inclusion of a placebo control. 
This Phase 2 clinical trial, designed to be a minimal risk study, has three specific aims :
 
(1) to determine whether daily  oral vitamin D 3 (3,333 IU/d) given to children and adolescents with sickle -
cell disease, compared to monthly bolus  oral vitamin D 3, (100,000 IU/mo ) will more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_565155],  defined as respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], exacerbations of asthma, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_565156];  
(2) to evaluate the effects of daily  oral vi tamin D 3 on pulmonary function ; and 
(3) to examine the effects of monthly oral vitamin D [ADDRESS_742230] no 
lasting effects in individuals with no sickle hemoglobinopathy can trigger severe or even fatal manifestations in 
those with sickle cell disease.18  For instance, children with influenza and sickle cell disease are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39869] 
a rate more than 50-fold greater than children without sickle cell dis ease.19 Asthma is common, affecting 15 to 
28% of children with sickling disorders.5 Unique to sickle cell disease is a respi[INVESTIGATOR_565157], respi[INVESTIGATOR_135746] a new pulmonary infiltrate, known as “acute chest syndrome.”[ADDRESS_742231] syndrome.23  
Vitamin D, in addition to its role in calcium and bone homeostasis, is a multifunctional regulator of innate and 
adaptive immune responses and of inflammation.7-11 Vitamin D acts, in part, through its metabolite, 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2D),24, [ADDRESS_742232] if not all cells of the immune system.26 1,25(OH) 2D 
mediates the innate immune host response against respi[INVESTIGATOR_565158] (hCAP18/LL37), an antimicrobial peptide with activity against viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens.
27, 
28 1,25(OH) 2D regulates the adaptive immune system by [CONTACT_21413] T- lymphocyte proliferation and function, 
and by [CONTACT_100276]-regulating the inflammatory response and cytokine expression.29 In addition to these functions of 
1,25(OH) 2D, the parent compound vitamin D itself is a potent and general mediator of endothelial stability and 
barrier function.[ADDRESS_742233] a heightened susceptibility to respi[INVESTIGATOR_565159] a 
greatly increased vulnerability to complications, we conducted the ViDAS -1 study, a 2-year active-controlled, 
double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing high-dose oral vitamin D 3, 100,000 IU, given once a month 
under observation (daily equivalent 3,333 IU/day), with standard-dose oral vitamin D 3, 12,000 IU, given once a 
month under observ ation (daily equivalent 400 IU/day),42 to determine if oral vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) can 
reduce the risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565160], 3 to 20 years old, with sickle cell disease 
(ViDAS-1  study ). Because of the established risks of inadequate mineralization of the skeleton associated with 
vitamin D deficiency,9, [ADDRESS_742234] been presented in our annual reports and are summarized here to clarify the 
rationale for the ViDAS -2 trial . Seventy  sickle cell subjects, ages 3-20 years, with baseline records of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565161], underwent screening. Sixty-two subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
levels 5-60 ng/mL were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to oral vitamin D 3 100,000 IU (n=31)  or 12,000 IU (n=31), 
under observed administration once monthly for two years. The primary outcome  was the annual rate of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_50127] ( respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], asthma exacer bation, acute chest syndrome) ascertained by [CONTACT_2363] a 
validated questionnaire administered biweekly . Analysis included 62 children, mean (SD) age 9.9 (3.9) years, 
32 (52%) females, predominantly HbSS (87%), with mean baseline 25- hydroxyvitamin D of 14.3 ng/mL. The 
mean (SEM) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations  during Treatment Years [ADDRESS_742235] of which were 
expected for sickle cell diseas e; none were attributed to the study drug. There were 17 abnormal safety 
laboratory values; all abnormal laboratory values were determined to be clinically insignificant, without requiring withholding or discontinuation of study treatment. 
The annual rates  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565162], intervention year -1, and year -2 with the high-dose were 
4.34±0.35 (SEM), 4.28±0.36, and 1.49±0.37, and, with the standard-dose, 3.91±0.35, 3.34±0.37, and 1.54±0.37, 
respectively (see Figure 1 above). In pediatric patients with sickle cell disease, two-year monthly oral vitamin D3 was associated with a >50% reduction in the rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565163], with similar decreases from high- and standard- dose treatment. 
In summary, in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease who received monthly bolus doses of oral 
vitamin D
3 under observation for two years, the annual rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], asthma 
exacerbations and acute chest syndrome) decreased by [CONTACT_726] 50% during the second year of treatment, 
with similar reductions in the groups treated with 100,000 IU/month and with 12,000 IU/month. The treatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to pulmonary function, hand-grip strength, fever or epi[INVESTIGATOR_565164] -occlusive pain. Both doses were safe with no significant differences in adverse events.

vitamin D3 given once a month under observation (daily equivalent 3,333 IU/day); Standard-dose, 12,000 IU  
(0.3 mg) vitamin D3 given once a month under observation (daily equivalent 400 IU/day).  
This ViDAS-[ADDRESS_742236] randomized clinical trial to examine the potential benefit of vitamin D for preventing 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_565165]. We chose monthly dosing to allow for directly observed administration and avoid non-adherence with daily dosing. We provided prolonged treatment to allow for 
seasonal variation. Our primary outcome measure was collected biweekly using a validated questionnaire
45 to 
adequately capture all respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343], and verified by [CONTACT_217703].  Because we could not include a placebo group, given the known risks of skeletal harm with vitamin D deficiency,
9, 42 -44 the decrease in 
the annual rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565166] 2 cannot be ascribed unequivocally to vitamin D supplementation. Nonetheless, no significant differences in the mean weekly rates of influenza- like illnesses in 
[LOCATION_001] City during the baseline and study years (2012-2015) were found by [CONTACT_565194]-Like Illness Surveillance Program ( ILINet).
[ADDRESS_742237]-dose group, the estimated mean dietary vitamin D of 228.6 IU/day, together with the monthly 
supplement pr oviding about 400 IU/day, would meet the current Estimated Average Requirement for vitamin D 
of 600 IU/day.9 Nonetheless, 25-OHD concentrations were at insufficient or deficient levels for skeletal health in 
75% of the standard-dose group while in the sufficient range in 98% of the high-dose group.  
Alternatively, both (i) the timing of the observed decreases in the annual rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565167] (ii) the 
uniformity in the magnitudes of the reductions with the standard- and high-dose treatments potentially could be 
explained by [CONTACT_565195] D used in the trial. Since the design of our study, new evidence has accumulated that circulating concentrations of vitamin D
3, the parent compound, rather than 
those of 25- OHD, may be vital determinants of the anti -infective, immunomodulatory and other extra-skeletal 
effects of supplementation.12, 13, 30, [ADDRESS_742238], if not all, cells of the immune system.
26 In addition to  these functions of 1,25(OH) 2D, the parent compound vitamin D 
itself is a potent and general mediator of endothelial stability and barrier function.[ADDRESS_742239] syndrome.  Daily  
supplementation with 2000– 6000 IU/d vitamin D 3 results, within three weeks, in stable circulating concentrations 
of vitamin D 3 within the range of 10– 40 ng/mL in a linear fashion.13, 55- 57 Our primary study hypothesis is that daily 
oral vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol), 3,333 IU/d (0.083 mg/d), will reduce the annual rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] 
(infections, exacerbations of asthma, and the acute chest syndrome) by 50% or more during Treatment Year 1 
compared with monthly  bolus oral vitamin D3, 100,000 IU/mo (25 mg/d) as a contr ol. 
The c ontrol treatment with monthly bolus administration should provide an estimate of the annual rates of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_565168] D levels (25(OH)D<20 ng/mL).9, 42 -44

6. Protocols :  
 6a. Study protocol:  This ViDAS-2  study is a 2-year active-controlled, double-blind, parallel -group, 
randomized Phase 2 clinical trial comparing the efficacy in reducing the rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565169] D3, 3,333 IU/d (0.083 mg/d) with monthly bolus oral 
vitamin D3, 100,000 IU/mo (2.5 mg/mo), as a control. A profile of the Phase 2 clinical trial design is shown 
schematically in the Figure.  
The s tudy population for the ViDAS -2 randomized trial will be recruited from among approximately 200 patients, 
ages 3-20 years old, followed in the Columbia University Medical Center Pediatric Sickle Cell Program. Subjects 
will be recruited and screened based on medical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, chemistry profile including calcium, phosphate, magnesium, BUN, 
creatinine, and liver function tests, urinalysis, and urinary calcium/creati nine ratio). Patients who complete the 
screening visit will then return and their potential inclusion in the trial will be determined by [CONTACT_565196] 25-
hydroxyvitamin D concentration:  
 (i)   Patients found to be severely vitamin D deficient, with a screening serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
concentration below 5 ng/mL, will not be randomized but will be eligible to continue participation in the study by 
[CONTACT_565197] D3, 3,333 IU/d (0.083 mg/d), in an open-label manner and by 
[CONTACT_565198]. Management of these patients will consist of oral administration of vitamin 
D
3, 100,000 IU, initially, followed by [CONTACT_92913] D 3, 100,000 IU, every other week for 2 months, and then daily 
oral vitamin D3, 3,333 IU/d (0.083 mg/d), thereafter for the duration of the study, with follow -up by [CONTACT_2299]’s 
attending physician. This schedule of vitamin D administration for treatment of vitamin D deficiency is consistent 
with the recommendations for Stoss therapy of vitamin D deficiency  by [CONTACT_565199].42  
 (ii)   Patients with excessive levels of vitamin D, as determined by a screening serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
concentration above 100 ng/mL, will be excluded from participation in the trial and referred to their attending 
physician for follow -up and management. We do not anticipate that any of our patients will have excessive levels 
of vitamin D but include this provision for exclusion as a precautionary measure. 
 (iii)    Patients with levels of vitamin D already within the range found in sun-rich environments, as determined 
by a screening serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 61-100 ng/mL, will not be randomized because no 
supplemental vitamin D would be indicated. We do not anticipate that  any of our patients will have levels of 
vitamin D in this range but if any are identified, they would be eligible to continue participation in the study and complete all other study procedures. They would not receive supplemental vitamin D within the study.  
 (iv)   Patients with a screening serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 5 - 60 ng/mL, will be randomized 
within a month in a gender - and age-stratified (3 to 9 and 10 to 20 years of age) manner to treatment with either 
(1) daily oral vitamin D3, 3,333 IU/d (0.083 mg/d) or (2) 100,000 IU (2.5 mg) oral vitamin D
[ADDRESS_742240] baseline assessments that will include: (i) pulmonary function 
test (limited to age above 5y/o); and (ii)  blood tests for biomarkers of inflammation (complete blood count, C -
reactive protein, and Th1/Th2 cytokines) . Participants will be seen monthly  in person or remotely in a telehealth 
visit for confirmation of administration of study drug,accounting of unused study drug,  interval history including 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_565170]. Laboratory safety assessments will include serum albumin-
corrected calcium and spot urinary calcium -creatinine ratios  to be obtained immediately before study  drug 
administration, and performed at intervals as shown in the Table (Schedule of Study Evaluations)  to monitor 
hypercalcemia and hypercal curia. Abnormal laboratory values will be reviewed by [CONTACT_565200], as described in detail below .

by [CONTACT_565201] -Tandem Mass Spectrometry ( See below for Vitamin D assay ).  
Adverse events will be determined according to the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events version 
4.0. Pulmonary function tests will be repeated at 12-months and 24-months after initiation of treatment, while the 
biomarkers of inflammation,  the health-related quality of l ife questionnaire and the Block Calcium and Vitamin D 
screener  and sun exposure questionnaires  will be collected every 6 months. Table 3 below  outlines the schedule 
of study evaluations.  
 
Primary Outcome Measure: Respi[INVESTIGATOR_412091] 
A Respi[INVESTIGATOR_565171], modified from established instruments,58, 59 will be used to track respi[INVESTIGATOR_481204]. The questionnaire, to be administered in person during monthly outpatient study visits and biweekly 
telephone interviews, includes questions about the following six symptoms: difficulty breathing, wheezing, feve r, 
cough, runny nose, and sore throat. If any of the above symptoms is present, additional questions about severity 
and duration of symptom, medication use, visit to a medical provider, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and missed school day/s 
due to illness will be asked. History of outpatient sick visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_565172]. All completed questionnaires will be reviewed and adjudicated in a blinded fashion by a 
designated Investigator  to determine whether a respi[INVESTIGATOR_565173]. 
(Study Questionnaire is attached in Appendix ) 
 Definitions of Respi[INVESTIGATOR_412091]:  
A “respi[INVESTIGATOR_110636]” will be considered if at least one of the six symptoms occurred, except for fever alone 
without accompanying respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], or a runny nose accompanied by [CONTACT_565202]/watery eyes suggestive of 
allergy. A new event will be counted if at least seven days had elapsed since the last counted event. Patients 
with prolonged respi[INVESTIGATOR_20321]/s lasting more than two weeks will be evaluated by [CONTACT_565203], 
whose final diagnosis will determine whether the symptom/s comprised a respi[INVESTIGATOR_110636].  
 “Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]” will be defined as: (i) runny nose, cough, or sore throat for at least [ADDRESS_742242] 1 day accompanied by [CONTACT_411], not otherwise attributed to allergy; (ii) physician diagnosed 
pharyngitis, otitis media, or influenza; or (iii) physician-diagnosed croup, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia. The study 
questionnaire was validated in our study populati on and found to have 80% over -all accuracy for identifying 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_565174]60. 
“Asthma exacerbation” will be defined by a physician-diagnosed acute asthma attack that required treatment 
with corticosteroids, emergency room treatment, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
“Acute chest syndrome” will be defined according to the standard definition, as an acute illness characterized by 
[CONTACT_59572]/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], accompanied by a new pulmonary infiltrate on a chest x -ray.[ADDRESS_742243] syndrome, the separate diagnoses will be counted as a single  event.   
 
Vitamin D assay:  
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25-OH -D2) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH -D3) will be measured and 
summed as total 25-h ydroxyvitamin D. Assays will be performed in the Biomarkers Core Laboratory within the 
Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography -Tandem 
Mass Spectrometry (LC -MSMS).  
  
Sample preparation:  
25-hyd roxyvitamin D [ADDRESS_742244] and vortexed, followed by [CONTACT_1121] 150uL of 0.2 M zinc sulfate. After mixing, 300uL of methanol is added followed by 750uL of 
hexane with vortexing in between. The mixture is again vortexed for 30 seconds followed by [CONTACT_128934] 
13,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The hexane layer is transferred to LC vials, dried down under nitrogen and dissolved 
in 100uL of 70% methanol.

LC-MSMS:  
LC-MSMS analysis will be performed on a UPLC -MS/MS platform comprising a triple quadruple Agilent 6410 
mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) integrated to Agilent UPLC 1290 series controlled by [CONTACT_565206] (version B 04.00). Chromatographic separation will be performed by [CONTACT_44579] 10uL 
of the extract onto an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC -C18 column (3.0 x 50mm, 2.7 µm) maintained at 50°C. The flow 
rate is maintained at 500µl/min. The initial flow conditions are 30% solvent A  (water containing 0.1% formic acid) 
and 70% solvent B (methanol containing 0.1% formic acid). Solvent B is raised to 90% linearly over 4min and to 
98% in 4.1min, held for 1.4min and back to initial conditions by 5.6min with a total run time of 6.5min. The mass 
spectrometer is operated under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with positive electrospray ionization. 
MRM transitions will be m/z 413->395 for 25(OH)D 2, 401->383 for 25(OH)D 3 and 407->389 for d6-25(OH)D 3. 
Retention times 2.89 min for 25(OH)D 3 and 3.04 min for 25(OH)D 2. Lower limit of quantitation for the assay for 
both 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2 is 1.25 ng/ml. Intra-day precision is 2.4% for 25(OH)D 2 and 3.5% for 25(OH)D 3. 
Inter-day precision is 8.1% for 25(OH)D 2 and 5.5% for 25(OH)D 3. Calibrators are standardized against the NIST 
standards.  
 Serum vitamin D
3, the parent compound, will be measured by [CONTACT_29864] -MSMS by [CONTACT_565207], Ames, Iowa.  
 
STUDY DRUG  
The 3,333 IU (0.083 mg) oral vitamin D 3, the 100,000 IU (2.5 mg) oral vitamin D 3, and placebo dosage forms will 
be custom manufactured as single batches from Tishcon Laboratories Inc, (Westbury, NY) a Good-
Manufacturing-Practice (GMP) facility, in identical capsule formulations but for the concentration of vitamin D 3. 
The content of active ingredient will be analyzed in random samples from the batch in Tishcon Laboratories by [CONTACT_5019]-performance liquid chromatography using [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia methods.  
 
For study participants randomiz ed to daily treatment, the 3,333 IU (0.083 mg) oral vitamin D
3 will be taken daily, 
with the dose at monthly  in-person visits administered by [CONTACT_565208] a telehealth visit. For study participants randomized to control treatment, placebo will be taken daily and 
the 100,000 IU (2.5 mg) oral vitamin D 3 dose will be administered by [CONTACT_565209]-person visits  or directly observed during a telehealth visi t. 
 
The rationale for the choice of oral vitamin D 3 dosage forms  is based on the results of our earlier ViDAS -1 trial. 
In our study population of children and adolescents with sickle cell disease, the majority of the participants (77%) 
had insufficient or deficient vitamin D levels (25(OH)D<20 ng/mL),42, 43 with an overall mean baseline 25(OH)D 
of 14.3 (median 14.6, range 5-28 ng/mL). Because of the established risks of inadequate mineralization of the 
skeleton associated with vitamin D insufficiency  and deficiency,9, 42 -44 a placebo group could not be included in 
the study design. At the end of our earlier ViDAS-1 trial, 25(OH)D concentrations were at insufficient or deficient 
levels for skeletal health in 75% of those who had received [ADDRESS_742246]-dose treatment (400 IU/day vitamin D supplement together with an estimated mean dietary vitamin D of 228.6 IU/day, providing the 
current Institute of Medicine Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin D of 600 IU/day, considered to 
meet the requirement of 97.5% of the population
9, 62). By [CONTACT_22242], in study participants who received 100,000 IU 
(2.5 mg) oral vitamin D 3 monthly (daily equivalent 3,333 IU/day) , 25(OH)D concentrations were in the sufficient 
range in 98%. Nonetheless, in the study participants receiving bolus 100,000 IU (2.5 mg) oral vitamin D 3 monthly 
during ViDAS -1 Treatment Year 1,  the annual rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], asthma 
exacerbations and acute chest syndrome) were not significantly different from the year -long ViDAS-1 baseline 
period with no supplemental vitamin D (baseline rate = 4.34±0.35 (SEM), Treatment Year 1 rate = 4.28±0.36).  
Accordingly, in the current trial, control treatment with bolus administration of 100,0 00 IU (2.5 mg) oral vitamin D [ADDRESS_742247] the skeletal  risks associated with insufficient or deficient vitamin D levels (25(OH)D< 20 
ng/mL).9, [ADDRESS_742248], 
daily supplementation with 2000– 6000 IU/d vitamin D 3 results, within three weeks, in stable circulating 
concentrations of vitamin D 3 within the range of 10– 40 ng/mL in a linear fashion.13, 55 -57 The study hypothesis is 
that participants randomized to daily  treatment with the 3,333 IU (0.083 mg) oral vitamin D [ADDRESS_742249] syndrome. As shown in our earlier ViDAS -1 trial, during 
Treatment Year 1, monthly  bolus  oral vitamin D 3 with 100,000 IU (2.5 mg) oral vitamin D 3 (daily equivalent 3,333 
IU/day) failed to decrease the annual rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565176] 
D supplementation. The continuation of the trial into Treatment Year 2 will determine (i) if any reduction in the 
rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565177] D3 seen during Treatment Year 1 is sustained and (ii) if monthly  bolus  
oral vitamin D 3 again reduces the rate of respi [INVESTIGATOR_565178] 50% or more during Treatment Year 2. To our 
knowledge, this study will provide the first direct comparison of the effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_565179] D that deliver approximately equivalent amounts of vitam in D per month. 
 
Drug Accountability : Once  a randomization request has been completed and at least 2 days before the  
scheduled Baseline study visit), the Study Coordinator will coordinate dispensing of the study medication by  [CONTACT_565210]. The Research Pharmacy is responsible for determining which assignment (A or B) is active 
study -dose treatment (vitamin D 3 3,333 IU/capsule to take daily except during the monthly study visit when 3,333  
IU/capsule x [ADDRESS_742250] observation by [CONTACT_565211]) , and which assignment is 
control -dose treatment ( placebo capsule to take daily except during monthly study visit when vitamin D 3 50,000 
IU/capsule x [ADDRESS_742251] 
observation vy study coordinator during telehealth visit). Study medication label s will include the prescription 
number, subject ID, and randomization ID as recorded in the Research Pharmacy Medication Dispensing Log. 
The initial dose will be administered during the Baseline study visit after all the baseline procedures have been 
completed. Two capsules containing either study -dose (3,333 IU/capsule x 1 caps ule and placebo x 1 capsule)  
or control -dose  (vitamin D 3 50,000 IU/capsule x 2 capsules ) will be given orally. Capsules can either be 
swallowed or for those subjects who are unable to swallow capsules, contents of the capsules can be sprinkled 
in apple sauce or pudding and consumed in its entirety. Subjects will be instructed to take one capsule daily until 
the time of the next study visit. Subjects will be asked to count and dispose a ny unused capsules observed on 
video by [CONTACT_565212].  The number of unused capsules will be recorded by [CONTACT_565213]. These procedures will be repeated at each 
monthly study visit. Month 24 will serve as the Study Exit visit; study drug will not be administered or dispensed 
at this visit.

Subject Justification:   
This study will enroll about 80 children and adolescents, ages 3-20 years, with sickle cell disease. Participation 
of children in the proposed research is essential to answer the research question, because pulmonary 
compli cations in sickle cell disease develop early in life. The study aims to determine whether vitamin D 
supplementation can reduce the risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565180]. The proposed research will predominantly include subjects of African origin, including African 
Americans and those from the Caribbean Islands (Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, West Indies, Cuba, and 
Haiti), because sickle cell disease primarily affects people of African descent.[ADDRESS_742252] Randomization:   
Within one month after  screening procedures have been completed, subjects will be randomized. Using 
computer -generated randomization, participants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 5- 60 ng/mL will be 
randomly assigned using randomly permuted blocks of size 2, 4 or 6 assignments with separate schema 
prepared for  stratification by [CONTACT_654] (3 -9 and 10-20), gender and hydroxyurea therapy . Randomization will be 
performed by [CONTACT_338909]; all other research staff and participants will be blinded to allocation.  
 
Subject Compensation:   
Study participants will receive $40 per monthly study visit, with the exception of the following 3 study visits: 1) 
Baseline/Randomization visit, 2) Month 12 visit, and 3) Month 24 Study exit visit, for which participants will 
receive $100. The modest compensation will be provided to compensate for participant's time, transportation 
expense, and completion of study -required procedures. Compensation will be in the form of cash or gift card and 
paid in installment during each monthly  visit. Participants will not be required to provide receipts for 
reimbursement. A total of $[ADDRESS_742253] who completes all study -
related visits.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
Our primary study hypothesis is that daily oral vitamin D
3 (cholecalciferol), 3,333 IU/d (0.083 mg/d), will reduce 
the annual rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (infections, exacerbations of asthma, and the acute chest syndrome) by 50% or more during Treatment Year 1 compared with monthly  bolus oral vitamin D3, 100,000 IU/mo (25 mg/d) 
as a contr ol. As detailed above, control treatment with bolus administration of 100,000 IU (2.5 mg/d) oral vitamin 
D3 monthly should provide an estimate of the annual rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565181].  
 
Our primary study anal ysis will examine the annual rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (the sum of respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], 
asthma exacerbations and epi[INVESTIGATOR_325848]) in children with sickle cell disease randomized in a double-blind manner to the daily and monthly doses of oral vitamin D
3. The primary statistical analysis will be 
by “intention to treat” and will use a semiparametric regression method to estimate the between group difference 
in intensity (events per subject per unit of time at risk) with the assumption that covariates have a multiplicative 
effect on the mean and rate functions. This approach takes account of the skewed distribution of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]. The results of this analysis will be summarized as a regression parameter estimate, with the standard  
error of the estimate, a chi -square test with associated p-value, and a hazard ratio with confidence limits 
expressing the rate difference of the daily relative to the monthly group (as described in Lin, DY, Wei, LJ, Yang, I, and Ying, Z. “Semiparametric regression for the mean and rate functions of recurrent events,” J R Stat Soc 
Series B Stat Methodol, 2000; 62:711– 730).
[ADDRESS_742254] for group differences in time-
independent covariates and estimate rate ratios at specific values of covariates and at specific times of follow up. The annualized rate of events and the average inter -event interval (in two-week intervals, the observation 
protocol) will be entered as time-independent covariates. After testing the initial hypothesis of overall group 
difference, we will sequentially test the between-treatment group differences in the s tudy design enrollment 
criteria strata: age, gender and therapy (hydroxyurea). Secondary analyses using the same statistical framework 
will separately test the study hypotheses at the one-year time point. The functional form of covariates and 
proportional hazards assumptions will be checked for all models and cumulative hazard plots and cumulative 
residual plots will be used to display group differences in the evolution of events and model fit, respectively. 
 
Subsidiary analyses will be made to examine a number of secondary study hypotheses with respect to the effects 
of vitamin D
[ADDRESS_742255] not entered into the sample size calculation. Data will be summarized as means ± standard 
deviation or as counts and proportions. Study Group differences in continuous measures at baseline will be 
compared using independent t  tests and differences in dichotomous categorical measures at baseline will be 
compared using Fisher’ s exact test.  
 
Sample size 
For sample size estimation, we base our estimate of the annual rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_565182] -[ADDRESS_742256], we use the observed reduction in annual mean respi[INVESTIGATOR_565183]-1 trial for monthly  bolus oral vitamin D3, 100,000 IU/mo (2.5 mg/mo), from Treatment Year 1 to 
Treatment Year 2 from 4.28±0.36 (SEM) to 1.49±0.37, or a decrease of about [ADDRESS_742257] size of 
this magnitude with a two-sided significance level of alpha = 0.025 and 90 percent power. Allowing for 
as much as a 15 percent loss of participants during the two-year study (due to clinical events, such as 
initiating chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy, failure of compliance or exclusion or withdrawal for 
any reason), then our sample size estimate is 26/0.85 = [ADDRESS_742258]; 90 percent power; 
and a generous allowance for loss of participants, should help provide adequate power for subsidiary 
comparisons.  
 
Annualized Event Rate and Inter -Event-Interval (IEI)  
Individual participant rates of events during the treatment phase (Treatment Years 1 and 2) will be annualized by [CONTACT_565214] 365.25. Individual participant inter -event-interval (IEI) will be 
the average of the number of days between the first day of observation and the day of the first event and the 
number of days separating the resolution of one event to the onset of the subsequent event. The treatment 
phase IEI will be calculated as the average of the number of days separating the resolution of one event to the 
onset of the subsequent event, the number of days from randomization to the first event, and the days between 
the last event and final day of study participation. If a participant is in the midst of an event epi[INVESTIGATOR_565184], the calculation of the average IEI will start with the date the event resolved.  
 
Treatment Outcome Analysis  
All primary and secondary outcome analyses will be performed under the intent-to-treat principle. Crude 
estimates of  group differences in the annualized event rate and average inter -event-interval during Treatment 
Year 1 and Treatment Year 2 will be analyzed by [CONTACT_565215], time and group-by -time interaction, and an AR(1) covariance structure. Analyses of secondary 
outcomes for pulmonary function testing will also use this approach. Further analysis of treatment group 
differences will be assessed using a variation of the Cox Proportional Hazards model with a counting process 
input of start and stop times for each event and the robust sandwich covariance estimator of Lin.
[ADDRESS_742259] ratios 
with 95% confidence intervals and Wald Chi -Square statistics for testing the null hypothesis. We will evaluate 
the influence of the event rate, average IEI as covariates and calculate between treatment group hazard ratios. 
We will also evaluate the influence of randomization stratifying variables as covariates of the estimate of the 
between treatment group difference: sex (female vs male), age (child vs adolescent) and hydroxyurea use (use 
vs non-use). For participants in each treatment group who withdraw from the study prior to completion of the 
protocol, we will repeat the primary intent-to-treat analysis with the subset of participants who completed the 
two-year study in a “per protocol” analysis. Finally, treatment group differences in adverse events of least grade 
2 severity will be assessed with chi -square or Fisher’s Exact test. We will only present compari sons of events 
where three or more instances are reported over the two-year treatment period.  
 
 
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
Adherence to protocol : Conduct of the clinical trial will be in accordance with this new protocol for the ViDAS -[ADDRESS_742260] (DSMB) consisting of an expert in pediatric sickle cell disease, a biostatistician, and a Pediatric 
Endocrinologist with expertise in vitamin D metabolism. The DSMB will meet bi -annually. 
 Safety monitoring and review plan: For the first month after initiation of study treatment, the Clinical Research 
Coordinator   will telephone each study participant (or their parent or guardian) weekly to ask about any adverse 
experiences or any change from baseline status. To maintain blinding of participant treatment assignment during safety monitoring, a Clinical Trial Safety Officer, a physician expert in Pediatric Endocrinology and vitamin D 
metabolism, will be appointed to review laboratory results as they are performed during the course of the clinical 
trial to detect any abnormality requiring intervention. Abnormalities that require dose adjustment or other 
intervention will be reported immediately to the Sponsor -Investigator  and summarized for annual reports to the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the DSMB, and the Columbia U niversity Institutional Review Board 
(CU IRB).  
 
Reporting of adverse events :  All identified Adverse Events will be reported to the Sponsor -Investigator . The 
Sponsor -Investigator  will determine whether the event is serious  or an Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
and requires expedited reporting. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that meet criteria for FDA and/or CU IRB 
reporting, i.e., unexpected, suspected to be related to study drug (FDA requirements), or unanticipated problems  
(CU IRB requirement) will be reported within [ADDRESS_742261] also report SAEs that meet criteria for FDA and/or CU IRB 
reporting to the DSMB promptly within one week, while other SAEs that do not meet the above criteria will be 
reported to the DSMB Chair quarterly. The Sponsor -Investigator  is requi red to report to the FDA serious, 
unexpected, suspected adverse event within [ADDRESS_742262] research that 
is unexpected, related or possibly related to research participation, and suggests that the research places 
subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (physical, psychological, economic or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized. Adverse Events that do not meet the criteria of a SAE will be reported the DSMB 
during biannual review.  
 Clinical Trial Data and Safety Monitoring Board review : The Trial Statistician and Trial  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_565185] 
a report for the DSMB at the end of Treatment Year 1 and Treatment Year 2. Data will be presented in a blinded fashion and study subjects will be identified only in the case of a safety concern. Bia nnual (and, if needed, more 
frequent) safety reviews will be conducted. Consideration for early termination of the trial will include: (i) failure 
of enrolled participants to meet entry criteria, (ii) differences in the baseline characteristics of the two study 
groups (despi[INVESTIGATOR_565186] - and age -stratified randomization), (iii) excessive or unbalanced loss of study 
participants, and (iv) other considerations to be determined by [CONTACT_4318]. 
 
Data management and quality : The Sponsor -Investigator  or a designated Study Investigator  will review all 
completed data collection forms bi annually for protocol compliance and for completeness and accuracy of data. 
A statement of the results of this review will be included in the annual report to the FDA Orphan Products 
Program, in the annual IND report to the FDA, the CU IRB , and in the bia nnual reports to the Clinical Trial Data 
and Safety Monitoring Board and. 
 
Reviews of clinical trial progress :  Progress in the conduct of the clinical trial will be reviewed at least annually 
and more fr equently as required by [CONTACT_565216] , and biannually by [CONTACT_565217], 
 
Records to be kept: Case Report Forms (CRF) will be provided for each subject.  Subjects will not be identified 
by [CONTACT_98752]. After patient and subject identifiers have been replaced by [CONTACT_565218], 
the results of all clinical and laboratory assessments will be recorded on Case Report Forms for each subject. In 
a similar manner, demographic data and data from the medical hi story, physical examination will be recorded on 
Case Report Forms. All data on the Case Report Forms will be legibly recorded in black ink or typed. Corrections 
will be made by [CONTACT_1022] a single line and then entering the c orrect information 
adjacent to it. The correction will be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_1034] -Investigator  or a designated, qualified 
staff member. Any requested information that is not obtained as specified in the protocol will have an explanation 
noted on the Case Report Forms as to why the required information was not obtained. Data for the Case Report 
Forms will be entered into a computerized database and entered into a Columbia University Certified 
Environment encrypted and protected with a strong passw ord, in accordance with Columbia University 
encryption policies  
 
Confidentiality of study data:  The Sponsor -Investigator will be responsible for the accumulation and 
maintenance of appropriate data files and the preservation of the confidentiality and sec urity of these files. The 
need for strict confidentiality of all study records will be emphasized to the staff of the study. Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_565219] a Study Identification Number. All 
reports and summaries prepared by [CONTACT_565220] a way that no individual participant 
can be identified. The data collected in this study will remain under the control of the Investigator and will be kept 
confidential with the s ole exception that Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_565187]. If publications result, volunteer names will not be used. All forms, computer tapes and diskettes will be kept in locked cabinets.  All computerized files will be encrypted and 
protected with a strong password, in accordance with Columbia University encryption policies.

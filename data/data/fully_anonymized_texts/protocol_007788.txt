2. Objectives :  
Primary aim :  
i. Evaluate if there is a significant difference in the number of staple load firings required for endoscopic (EGD) vs. ViSiGi® 3D suction 
device for calibration during sleeve gastrectomy  
Secondary aims:  
ii. Evaluate if there is a significant difference in operative duration (time) and intra -operative cost for  patients undergoing EGD vs. 
ViSiGi® 3D suction device calibration during sleeve gastre ctomy  
iii. Assess longer post -operative outcomes including GERD symptom 
severity and weight loss  
1. GERD -HRQL questionnaire pre -op and post -op 2 ( +/- 2 
months ) & 12 mo (+/ - 12 months ) (4)  
2. Weight loss – mean % total body weight loss, mean % 
EWL, mean % change in BMI (12 mo, +/ - 12 months ) 
3. Background  
Previous studies have shown that compared to a standard weighted rubber bougie (RB), 
using a suction calibration device (SCD) results in a straighter staple l ine compared to a 
twisted and corkscrewed staple line (1); no studies to date have compared upper 
endoscopy calibration to SCD for SG.  Due to the straighter, and therefore shorter, staple line, the hypothesis is the surgeon should be able to use fewer sta ple loads with a 
SCD. Bariatric staple loads are expensive, so a reduction in their use has the potential for savings to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 The study will also look at how a suction calibration system can create savings for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431193].  As previously mentioned, the SCD may require fewer stapler load firings; it also eliminates the need for placing multiple tubes in to the stomach as well as an upper endoscopy leak test and therefore saves the OR staff time and may decrease operative duration. The SCD is also disposable which

7 
 
Page 7 of 15   Version: 1.0, 06/17/2021  
IRB Form BIO 03152021  eliminates the need for reprocessing. Current estimates for reprocessing an endoscope 
are around $200 (2) thus the SCD use may decrease operative cost.   
 
It is also hypothesized that a misaligned smaller sleeve after a LSG procedure can 
increase the prevalence of post -operative GERD due to removal of the fundus and 
twisting of the sleeve (3). A straighter, correctly calibrated sleeve should decrease the prevalence of GERD in patients.  Therefore, the study will also look at the prevalence of pre-operative vs. post -operative GERD symptoms in patients who are undergoing LSG 
with endoscopic calibration vs. SCD.

5.  Procedures Involved  
• Pre-operative period & Bariatrical Surgical consult (usually 1 -2 mo prior to 
surgery) period:  
o Assessing candidacy for study enrollment, research consent process, surgeon education on device, and GERD- HRQL for diagnostic and 
research purposes  
o Patients wil l be randomized to either the EGD vs. the ViSiGi device for 
sleeve gastrectomy calibration  
o Neither the surgeon nor patient will be blinded to the device used  
o Patients will find out if they are in the EGD vs. ViSiGi device group pre -
operatively  
 
• Day of surgery = Postop Day zero (POD0)  
o Use of EGD vs. ViSiGi calibration for sleeve intended for therapeutic and research purposes for surgeon  
Protocol Title:  Endoscopic vs. suction device calibration in sleeve gastrectomy

Page 9 of 15   Version: 1.0, 06/17/2021  
IRB Form BIO 03152021  o Risks/discomforts of EGD and ViSiGi device are comparable.  Using a 
ViSiGi device is similar to both a standard weighted bougie and an EGD calibration technique.  The ViSiGi device is similar to a gastroscope in that 
they both have suction, calibration, and leak testing capabilities.   The 
benefit of the ViSiGi device is that it obviates the need for doing an EGD during sleeve gastrectomy, is single patient use and thus does not require reprocessing, and doesn’t require a scope tower to operate it.  Potential benefits of using the ViSiGi device (in lieu of endoscopic calibration) in order of highest probability are as follows: 1) less staple loads, 2) shorter OR time, 3) reduced cost, 4) decreased post -op GERD rates.  
o Data analyst and study coordinator to have research roles at thi s time  
 
• Immediate post -op follow -up 3 weeks after surgery (+/ - 2 weeks) to 12 months 
out (+/ - 12 months)  
o Assessments made by [CONTACT_431203], therapeutic and research purposes as appropriate

7. Local Number of Participants  
There is no additional screening for the study that the patient would already be subject to if they were not part of the study. There will be 50 patients undergoing LSG with an 
endoscope and 50 patients undergoing LSG with a suction calibration system.  Patients will be assigned randomly to each group.   
8. Recruitment Methods  
9. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_941] 1) treating physician/surgeon and/or her clinical staff or 2) the study staff reviewing clinic and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614]. Risk to Participants  
The risk for participating in this study is expected to be minimal and equivalent to 
standard peri -operative morbidity a nd mortality associated with sleeve gastrectomy. 
Moreover, patient safety and risk profiles are expected to be similar between the endoscopic vs. suction device calibration techniques.  A rare complication associated with laparoscopic bariatric is tube/pro be stapling during sleeve gastrectomy.  Given that 
the ViSiGi device is a plastic tube it could potentially be stapled across during gastrectomy or cause other trauma to the stomach or esophagus with intra -operative 
manipulation during sleeve gastrectomy.  It is also possible for a gastroscope to be 
stapled across during gastrectomy and to cause mucosal trauma with manipulation and 
suctioning during sleeve gastrectomy.  Again, the overall risk directly associated with 
intra -operative use of either the ViSiGi or endoscopic devices during sleeve gastrectomy 
risk anticipated to be minimal (< 1%) and similar between groups.

13. Statistical Analysis  
There will be 50 patients undergoing LSG with an endoscope and 50 patients 
undergoing LSG with a suction calibration system.  Both methods are clinically accepted and approved methods of performing the procedure.  The target enrollment will be 125 to account for attrition due to screen failur es, early 
withdrawals, etc. For this study we use a randomized block design (RBD) to assign participants to one of two sleeve groups. In a RBD we divide participants into subgroups called blocks (e.g. gender, race, etc.), such that the variability within blocks is less than the variability between blocks. Then, subjects within each block 
are randomly assigned to treatment conditions (i.e. SG with EGD or SG with ViSiGi device). The purpose of the RBD is to help reduce variability within treatment conditions and potential confounding from blocking factors, producing a better 
estimate of treatment effects.  We are adequately powered to detect a mean difference in stapler load firings of 0.[ADDRESS_545519] been performed statistical methods will be implemented to determine any difference in outcomes.  An initial approach will focus on a pairwise analysis (t -test) between the ViSiGi  and EGD calibration groups 
for each of the primary and secondary aims.  A more comprehensive multivariate analysis factoring in demographic and clinical variables will be performed to further 
delineate significant differences in the [ADDRESS_545520] been trained using the ViSiGi device via online video -based education

15. Economic Burden to Participants  
N/A 
 16. Informed Consent Process  
Consent will be obtained in person before the patient undergoes surgery by [CONTACT_458], co -investigators, and/or research study coordinator. Consent will 
likely occur at  the initial surgical consultation, but may be obtained at any point prior to 
randomization. Patients will be notified if they are going to be in the EGD vs. ViSiGi device arm of the sleeve gastrectomy protocol during the perioperative  period; it will be explained to them that this selection is being done in a randomized fashion, similar 
to flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin, factoring in various patient -related factors.  No elements of HIPAA will 
be waived. The study participants are legal adults and not pregnant, prisoners , or 
otherwise cognitively impaired in any way.   
 DocuSign:  
The study team will use an Emory DocuSign account that is HIPAA compliant and meets the FDA’s requirement for CFR Part 11 signatures. The consent process begins when a patient is screened and ide ntified as eligible for study participation. A member from the 
study team will discuss the informed consent form in its entirety with the potential participant via telephone phone and/or  Zoom. The patient’s identity will be verified by 
[CONTACT_431207]/she confirm their demographical information (i.e. ful l name, DOB, 
address, etc.).    In DocuSign, potential subjects have the ability to review the consent document as freely as they woul d if they were consenting in person. They also have the opportunity 
to exit the document without signing. The patient will be offered ample time to discuss the informed consent form with family and or friends, and have questions answered.  
 
The process for obtaining final consent is outlined below:  
1. First, the IRB -approved, stamped informed consent form(s) are added to an 
envelope in DocuSign.

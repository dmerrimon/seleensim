2.1 Background and Rationale
Why This Study is Being Conducted
Central precocious puberty (CPP) is an orphan disease that affects the pediatric population.  
Gonadotropin -releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are the treatment of choice for CPP.  The goal of 
therapy is to suppre ss pi[INVESTIGATOR_350254] (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle -stimulating 
hormone [FSH]) and peripheral sex steroids (estradiol and testosterone) and to arrest premature 
progression of secondary sexual characteristics.  Children with CPP may require ex tended therapy (up to 
10 years) to achieve continuous hormonal suppression until they reach an age at which the patient, 
family, and practitioner agree that puberty should resume.
Leuprolide acetate (LA) is a GnRHa that is approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US ) and other countries for the 
treatment of children with CPP.  It is marketed as Lupron Depot -PED® in the US.  Lupron Depot is also 
approved in the US and other countries for the treatment of prostate cancer, endometriosis, and uterine 
leiomyomata.  Lupron Depot -PED is available in 1 -month formulations (7.5, 11.25, and 15 mg) and 
3-month formulations (11.25 and 30 mg) for the treatment of children with CPP in the US.
The Lupron Depot 45 mg 6 -month dose is approved for the treatment of adults with prostate c ancer; 
this is the same formulation that is being investigated for use for treatment of CPP and contains the 
same active ingredient as the 1 -and 3 -month formulations of Lupron Depot -PED in a prefilled dual 
chamber syringe.
The currently approved Lupron De pot-PED regimens for CPP require 4 to 12 injections per year.  The 
need for frequent injections can cause distress for both the child and the parents (or legal guardians) 
and may require absences from school for the child and absences from work for parents (or legal 
guardians).  While longer -acting GnRHa treatments (implants) are available, these treatments require 
general anesthesia to surgically place and remove.  Development of a longer -acting depot formulation 
for children with CPP would reduce the numb er of injections and provide more treatment options for 
health care providers; a longer -acting formulation may also reduce the number of occurrences of 
injection site pain, which is the most commonly reported adverse event related to treatment of children 
with CPP with Lupron Depot -PED (see Section 2.2).  LA 45 mg 6 -month has not been studied in children 
with CPP.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
The b enefits of treatment with LA for children with CPP are well documented:  improvements in the 
signs and symptoms of CPP, suppression of pubertal gonadotropin and/or sex steroid levels, halting the 
progression and/or promoting the regression of Tanner stages, and slowing or halting of epi[INVESTIGATOR_893742].1
The overall safety of Lupron Depot -PED 11.25 mg 3 -month and 30 mg 3 -month is well characterized, 
with approximately  doses having been administered to pediatric patients worldwide, 
representing approximately  patient -years of exposure.  In ad dition, Lupron Depot -PED 11.25 mg

36-month extension study (Study L -CP07 -177).3  The safety profile of LA 45 mg 6 -month in c hildren with 
CPP is expected to be similar to that of the approved Lupron Depot -PED formulations for the treatment 
of CPP with similar hormonal changes (initial flare effect with corresponding LH/estradiol/testosterone 
elevations followed by a rapid declin e to prepubertal levels).
Since LA [ADDRESS_1251901] 
commonly reported adverse event in children with CPP in Study L -CP07 -167 (Lupron Depot -PED 11.25 
and 30 mg 3 -month formulations); injection site pain was also a commonly reported adverse event in 
adults with prostate cancer in a 6 -month study of the 45 mg formulation (Study L -PC07 -169).  Injection 
site pain occurred in 26% of pediatric subjects in the 30 mg group and 19% of pediatric subjects in the 
11.25 mg group in Study L -CP07 -167.  Injection site pain occurred in 18% of adult subjects with prostate 
cancer in the 45 mg 6 -month study ( Study L -PC07 -169).
All adverse events of injection site pain in pediatric subjects were mild to moderate in intensity in the 
11.[ADDRESS_1251902] in the 30 mg group.  Similarly, in Study L -CP07 -177 (an 
extension of Study L -CP07 -167), only 1 severe event of injection site pain was reported ([ADDRESS_1251903] in the 
11.25 mg group).  No increase in incidence over time or worsening in intensity was apparent.
See the current package inserts for a more comprehensive listing of known and potential safety risks 
and benefits.
3OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
Objectives and Hypotheses
Primary
To assess the safety and efficacy of LA [ADDRESS_1251904] been previously treated with a 
GnRHa.
The hypotheses corresponding to the primary objective are that treatment of children with CPP with LA 
45 mg 6 -month is well tolerated and effectively maintains continuous hormonal suppression following 
administration.  Administration of 1 intramuscular dose of LA 45 mg 6 -month provides sufficient 
leuprolide serum concentrations to achieve suppression of LH (determined by [CONTACT_893760] 
< 4mIU/mL) at Week 24 in children with CPP.
Secondary
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamics of leuprolide following intramuscular 
administration of the LA 45 mg 6 -month depot formulation in subjects with CPP.

3.4 Safety Endpoints
Adverse events, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, LA 45 mg injection site reactions, 
hormonal flare and acute -on-chronic (AOC) response, and clinical laboratory test results will be assessed 
throughout the study.
3.5 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
The pharmacokinetics of leuprolide will be evaluated using population phar macokinetic analysis.  
Furthermore, the relationship between leuprolide pharmacokinetics and clinical response 
(pharmacodynamics of leuprolide measured as LH, testosterone [males], and estradiol [females]) in 
children with CPP will be examined.
The objecti ves of this population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis are as follows:
To estimate the mean pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (LH, testosterone [males], and 
estradiol [females]) parameters in a population of pediatric subjects with CPP.
To inves tigate and identify fixed effect sources of variability (covariates) that may influence the 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of leuprolide.
To estimate the magnitude of inter -individual variability of the parameters.
To measure the random residual variabi lity.
Serum leuprolide and gonadotropin/sex hormone concentrations will be modeled using an appropriate 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to describe factors that influence leuprolide 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response in children with CPP.
Other parameters, including parameters that describe leuprolide absorption characteristics, may be 
estimated if useful in the analysis.

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
Study M16 -904 is a Phase 3, open -label, multicenter study that will be conducted in 2 parts (Parts 1 and 
2) at approximately 20 sites (US and Puerto Rico).  The safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics of the LA 45 mg formulation administer ed with a 6 -month dosing interval in children 
with CPP will be evaluated.  Approximately 40 subjects who were previously treated with GnRHa 
therapy (minimum of 15 previously treated subjects) or who are naïve to previous GnRHa treatment 
(minimum of 15 naïv e subjects) will be enrolled in the study.  See Section 5for information regarding 
eligibility criteria.
LH and sex steroid suppression and pubert al symptom progression will be assessed.  Efficacy endpoints 
are based on hormonal suppression.  Stabilization or regression of signs of puberty and effects on bone 
age and growth rate will be evaluated.
The total duration of the study (Parts 1 and 2) will be 160 weeks as follows:
Part 1:  52 weeks (4 -week screening period + 48 -week treatment period)
Part 2:  108 weeks (additional 96 -week treatment period + 12 -week follow -up period)
The Screening Period may be extended in certain circumstances (e.g., pendi ng laboratory test results) 
following consultation with the sponsor .
Part 1:   The safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the LA 45 mg 6 -month dose 
will be evaluated in subjects with CPP from Baseline to Week 48.  In all subjects, blood samples for 
efficacy assessments (analysis of LH, FSH, testosterone concentrations [males], and estradiol 
concentrations [females]) will be collected at Baseline and at Weeks 1, 4, 12, 20, 24, 44, and [ADDRESS_1251906] subjects who are enroll ed ([ADDRESS_1251907] 8 naïve and 8 previously 
treated), concentrations of leuprolide will be measured at each study visit following administration of LA 
45 mg 6 -month to characterize the leuprolide concentration- time profile, rate of absorp tion, and 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of leuprolide and LH.  Investigative sites will be notified 
when the pharmacokinetic subset has been fulfilled.
Leuprolide and appropriate measures of efficacy (LH, FSH, estradiol in females, testoster one in males) 
will be monitored upon data availability to evaluate the appropriateness of the 24 -week dosing interval 
for the 6 -month formulation for CPP.
Part 2:   Following completion of Part 1 assessments, subjects will continue to Part 2 of the study 
(extension period) to evaluate long -term administration of LA 45 mg 6 -month (up to 24 months).  Study 
visits during the extension period will start at Week 48 and continue once every 24 weeks for 96 weeks 
(24 months) until the subject discontinues treatment of LA 45 mg 6 -month or withdraws from the study.  
Subjects will be assessed for continued maintenance of LH suppression and safety throughout this 
extension period.

All subjects in this study will receive the same treatment; therefore, subjects will not be randomized.
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_117946].  For 
subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_110991].  Enrollment will be limited by [CONTACT_893768] a minimum of [ADDRESS_1251929] subjects enrolled in 
the study will au tomatically be assigned to the pharmacokinetic subset for collection of blood samples 
for the quantification of leuprolide concentration, with a minimum of 8 subjects naïve to GnRHa 
treatment (maximum of 12 subjects) and a minimum of [ADDRESS_1251930] be en previously treated 
with a GnRHa (maximum of 12 subjects).
At the beginning of Part 2, using the IRT system, half of the subjects will be randomly selected to have 
AOC biochemical assessment 48 hours after the injection of study drug at Weeks 48, 72, 96, and 120.  
Randomization will be stratified based on previous GnRHa treatment status (treatment -naïve or 
previous treated with a GnRHa).  The randomization schedule will be generated and kept by [CONTACT_893769] a copy will be forwarded to the IRT provider.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].5.8 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The investigator is responsible for comp lying with all 
protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a 
protocol deviation occurs (or is identified), the investigator is responsible for notifying the independent 
review board (IRB), regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].
6SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
6.[ADDRESS_1251931]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, l abeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be report ed to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An adverse event is defin ed as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event, therefore, can be any unfavorable a nd unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal (investigational) product , whether or not the event is considered causally related to the 
use of the product.
Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in 
severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events o nly if they result in 
discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator 
considers them to be adverse events.
Page 20 of 85 
STUDY M16 -904  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_1251932] for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse even ts on a 
routine basis throughout the study.  All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse 
event if the surgery/procedure is being perform ed for a pre -existing condition and the 
surgery/procedure was pre-planned prior study entry .  However , if the pre -existing condition 
deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the 
deterioration of the co ndition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered 
an adverse event.
If an adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is 
to be reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilan ceor contract research organization (as appropriate) 
as an SAE within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_1251933] information) :
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurre d in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66748]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission t o an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Page 21 of 85 
STUDY M16 -904  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_1251934] and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Add itionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_1251935] of study drug ([ADDRESS_1251936] administration of study drug) will be 
collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].  In addition, all SAEs and study
procedure -related nonserious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject's parent or 
legal guardian signs the study -specific informed consent until study drug administration .
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the Investigational Medicinal Product in accordance with global and local regulations.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following adverse events of special interest must be captured:
Bone fracture/ osteoporosis/osteopenia
Slipped capi[INVESTIGATOR_269646]
Neuropsychiatric events
Seizure/convulsion
Injection site reaction*
Hypersensitivity reaction
*All injection site reactions, whether associated with study drug administration or with the stimulation 
test, must be captured as adverse events.  Any injection site reaction that reaches seriousness criteria as 
stated above will be captured as an SAE and rep orted as described.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event:
Page 22 of 85 
STUDY M16 -904  |  Version 3.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Mild:   The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate:   The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities.
Severe:   The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may 
be incapacitating or life -threatening.
The investigator w ill use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the 
use of study drug:
Reasonable Possibility:   After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alter native causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Possibility:   After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes , there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an adverse event, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1251937] 
be discontinued (Section 5.4).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information regarding the 
pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is 
considered an SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1251938]'s source documents and appropriate eCRF.
Drug -Related Events
LA is known to cause gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_893744].  
Therefore, an increase in clinical signs and symptoms, such as menses or spotting in females and 
behavioral changes in males, may occur at t his time.  These events should be recorded in the subject's 
source documents and appropriate eCRF. 
The investigator will assess the subject for any LA- related symptoms at office visits or during parent or 
legal guardian phone calls that occur after each i njection of study drug , whether expected or

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].unexpected; any worsening of pre -existing conditions (such as rapid progression of CPP symptoms) will 
be reviewed to determine whether they should be reported as adverse events.
7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATIO N OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the database lock.  The statistic al 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
At the end of Part 1, an analysis of the primary, secondary, and other efficacy variables that were 
collected during Part [ADDRESS_1251939] completes the study.
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_1251940] 1 dose of study drug.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
Primary Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with suppression of GnRHa -stimulated LH 
(<4 mIU/mL) at Week [ADDRESS_1251941] dose of study drug but before the Week 24 dose.  95% 
confidence interval based on the binomial distribution (Clopper -Pearson exact method) will be provided 
for the primary efficacy endpoint.
Additional details on the primary and other efficacy analyses are prov ided in the SAP.
Sample Size Estimation
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  Based on previous studies and historical precedent 
that was used for registration (N = ~40), 40 subjects are sufficient to support the safety and efficacy for 
this cl ass of compounds in this patient population.  The planned sample size of 40 subjects will provide 
an observed response rate (of suppression of peak stimulated LH) that is within 16.7% of the true 
response rate with 95% confidence.
Page 24 of 85 
STUDY M16 -904  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_1251942]
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all subject materials will be 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval.  Approval of both the pr otocol and the informed consent 
form(s) must be obtained before any subject is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will require 
review and approval by [CONTACT_3484].  In addition, all

Unscheduled visits may occur at any time as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093].
Activities are grouped by [CONTACT_17203] (Interview, Exam, etc.).  Further information about each activity is 
provided in Section 3.
If a subject cannot come to the site because of an unforeseen circumstance (e.g., the COVID -19 
pandemic), study visits may be conducted virtually by [CONTACT_6624] (e.g., by [CONTACT_630]) or b y a qualified 
home healthcare nurse in a non -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic environment (e.g., the subject 's home) at the request of 
the investigator and with the agreement of the subject 's parent or legal guardian.  [COMPANY_013] should be 
notified if this occurs , and the resp ective COVID -19 electronic case report forms ( eCRFs) should be 
completed if applicable.  Any visits conducted virtually or partially should be recorded as such on the 
respective COVID -[ADDRESS_1251958] who is a minor should be informed within the limits of his/her 
understanding and with age -appropriate words.  When deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1201], the documented 
assent for subjects who are minors must be obtained.
Where assent is required, the investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study 
to the subject and the subject's parent/legal guardian and answer all questions regarding this study.  
Subjects will be included in all discussions in order to obtain verbal or written assent.  Prior to any study -
specific screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be 
reviewed and signed and dated by [CONTACT_423]'s parent/legal guardian, the person who administered the 
informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  Additionally, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_893745]'s IRB requirements, an informed assent form may also be obtained by [CONTACT_233963] s ubject 
prior to any study -related procedures being performed.  A copy of the informed consent form and the 
assent form will be given to the subject and the subject's parent/legal guardian, and the original will be 
placed in the subject's medical record.  I f a subject becomes of legal age during the course of the study, 
the consent procedure needs to be repeated.
3.2 Eligibility Criteria
Eligibility criteria will be assessed at Screening and on Day 1 (Baseline).
The results of certain retrospective procedures that were performed prior to informed consent that are 
considered standard of care and/or part of establishing a diagnosis of CPP, and that are used to establish 
eligibility for this study, may be used if the procedure was performed within the specified retrospective 
windows, as allowed by [CONTACT_760] (see Section 3.15 , Section 3.16 , Section 3.18 , and Sections 3.23
through 3.26 ).  Any results from prior procedures or blood tests that were used to establish eligibility 
must be available in the subject's source file; if not available in the subject's source file, the required 
test/proc edure will be repeated and results reviewed prior to the subject receiving the first injection of 
study drug.
3.[ADDRESS_1251959]'s medical history will be updated at 
the Day [ADDRESS_1251960]'s race, ethnicity, sex, and full date of birth; and a review of all major 
organ systems, including any history of ca ncer, diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal, cardiac, neurologic 
(including any trauma to the central nervous system), pulmonary, immunodeficiency, hepatic, renal, 
endocrine, or other systems.  The disease and condition will be captured, as well as date of o nset and 
whether the disease/condition is ongoing.
CPP History
Medical history will also focus on the subject's history of CPP and will record the date of any sign of 
puberty first noticed, and the date first visit seen by a physician for CPP.  The diagnos tic test(s) 
Page [ADDRESS_1251961] (GnRHa) treatment or previously treated with a 
GnRHa, and any prior GnRHa medications used in t he treatment of CPP will also be recorded.  A 
historical height (at least 6 months prior to Screening) is needed, and if available, historical information 
on subject's annual growth (height and date of height measurement) will be collected.
3.4 Family History
Family history:  parental actual height and age of puberty onset will be collected for both the birth 
mother and biological father, when available.  It is recommended that the actual heights of both parents 
be measured in triplicate, if possible, at the site by [CONTACT_893771].  
Otherwise measurements of actual height as reported will be captured.
3.[ADDRESS_1251962] rual History
A history of menstrual periods (female sub jects) , including date of first occurrence (menarche) will be 
collected.  Refer to Section 3.[ADDRESS_1251963]'s parent or legal guardian will complete the patient -reported outcome (PRO) instruments.  
The subject's parent or legal guardian should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the 
instruments and to provide the best possible response to each item.  The instrument that corresponds 
to the age at which the subject entered the study will be used throughout the study.
Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subject or subject's parent or legal 
guardian other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Site personnel may read the questionnaires 
to the subject's parent or legal guardian who is function ally unable to read the instruments.  Site 
personnel will encourage completion of the instruments at all specified visits (see Section 2) and will 
ensure that a resp onse is entered for all items.
Ifa subject cannot come to the site because of unforeseen circumstances (e.g. ,the COVID -19 
pandemic), patient -reported outcome entries may be administered by [CONTACT_893772] (sourc e) and transcribed into electronic data capture (EDC) or entered by 
[CONTACT_893773].  [COMPANY_013] should be notified if this occurs .

formulation pre -filled dual chamber syringe contains LA (45 mg), and the second chamber contains 
diluent.  Study drug must be prepared as described in the instructions for drug preparation (refer to
Section 7.3).
Study drug must not be administered without contact[CONTACT_110988].  Study drug may only be 
administered to subjects enrolled in the study through the IRT system.  If a subject cannot come to the 
site because of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., the COVID -19 pandemic ), the site may contact [CONTACT_893776].  Study drug can then be dispensed as described in Section 3.[ADDRESS_1251992], 20 µg/kg of generic LA aqueous solution will be administered subcutaneously.  Generic LA aqueous 
solution will be supplied to the sites for the purpose of conducting the stimulation test.  Each site will be 
responsible for maintaining drug accountability records, including product description, manufacturer, lot 
numbers, and administration to subjects.  Sites should use their standard of care practice for 
preparation of the injection s ite and injection of generic LA aqueous solution.  If a subject cannot come 
to the site because of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., the COVID -19 pandemic), the GnRHa stimulation 
test may be performed by a home healthcare nurse at the subject' s home.
There m ay be times when the sponsor is unable to provide the generic LA aqueous solution.  Under 
these circumstances, the participating sites have the option to obtain this product through an external 
licensed pharmacy or wholesaler or from local site supplies.
[COMPANY_013] will not supply drug other than the study drug LA [ADDRESS_1251993] be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F).  The 
investigational product is for investigational use only and is to be used only within the context of this 
study.  The study drug supplied for this study must be ma intained under adequate security and stored 
under the conditions specified on the label until administered.  Unused study drug should be destroyed 
on site as appropriate or returned to [COMPANY_013] in accordance with local regulatory requirements and 
[COMPANY_013] requ irements.

Temperature Excurs ion Management System (ATEMS) module via IRT for reporting temperature 
excursions for study drug (LA 45 mg 6 month), or if not accessible, fax or email copi[INVESTIGATOR_893751] (time, duration of the 
temperature excursion, minimum/maximum values and study drugs affected) to [COMPANY_013] Clinical Drug 
Supply Management (CDSM).  In case of a temperature excursion, study drug should be quarantined and 
not administered until [COMPANY_013] CDSM or ATEMS deems the medication as acceptable.  For reporting 
temperature excursions for generic LA aqueous solution, fax or email copi[INVESTIGATOR_893752].  In case of a temperature excursion, generic LA should be 
quarantined and not administered until [COMPANY_013] CDSM deems the product as acceptable.
6.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
This is an open -label, nonrandomized, single -arm study.  All subjects will receive the same dosage of LA 
(45 mg intramuscular every 24 weeks) for the duration of the study.
At the Screening Visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the use of the IRT.  
For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, site personnel must contact [CONTACT_893777] a screen failure.
Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number assigned at the Screening Visit throughout 
the study.  Upon receipt of study drug, the site will acknowledge receipt in the IRT system.
Contact [CONTACT_893778].
6.[ADDRESS_1251995]
All subjects who are enrolled in the study will receive the same dose of LA (45 mg) administered 
intramuscularly once every [ADDRESS_1251996] cannot come to the site because of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., the COVID -19 
pandemic), the study drug injection may be administered by a home healthcare nurse at the subje ct’s 
home. [COMPANY_013] should be notified if this occurs.

Reconstitution and Administration for Injection of LU PRON DEPOT
Reconstitute and administer the lyophilized microspheres as a single intramuscular 
injection.
Inject the suspension immediately or discard if not used within two hours, because LUPRON 
DEPOT does not contain a preservative.
1.Visually inspect the L UPRON DEPOT powder.  DO NOT USE the syringe if clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_893755].  A thin layer of powder on the wall of the syringe is considered normal prior to mixing 
with the diluent.  The diluent should appear clear and colorless.
2.To prepare for injection , screw the white plunger into the end stopper until the stopper begins 
to turn (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).

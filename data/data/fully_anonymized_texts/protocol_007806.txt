21 September 2021  7 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT S UMMARY OF CHANGES TA BLE 
Amendment 1 21 September 2021   
This amendment is considered substantial based on the criteria d efined in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union because it significantly impacts the scientific value of the study  
Overall rationale for the current Amendment : This amendment is intended to modify 
the dose of each mRNA -[ADDRESS_966876] of main changes in the protocol and their rationale:  
Section # and title  Description of change  Brief rationale  
2.2 Background  Moderna has been  evaluating the use of 50 µg 
(half dose) or  100 µg (full dose)  of mRNA -
[ADDRESS_966877] the Wuhan 
strain and variant viruses tested in all 
participants [ Wu, 2021b].  It is however 
unclear if the half dose will sufficiently 
boost the immune response against other 
variants that are expected to emerge as the 
pandemic continues to evolve. Additional 
trials are underway to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of different d ose levels of 
the booster vaccines e.g.100 µg of mRNA -
1273 (clinicaltrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), as 
well as newly developed variant -specific 
vaccines (clinicaltrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
As of September 14th, 2021, the half dose (50 
µg) mRNA -[ADDRESS_966878] 6 
months after the primary series for certain 
populations at higher risk of severe COVID -
19 disease. [JCVI 2021] The half dose 
mRNA -1273 booster is under evaluation by 
[CONTACT_710908]. (Amended 21 
September 2021 ) Background for consideration of the 50 
µg dose of the mRNA -1273 vaccine.

21 September 2021  8 Section # and title  Description of change  Brief rationale  
4.[ADDRESS_966879] the current 
regulatory environment.  
4.3 Justification of 
dose.  Moderna’s mRNA -[ADDRESS_966880] the wildtype  SARS -CoV-2 
virus and other tested variants, with a safety 
profile consistent with the known profile in 
earlier clinical trials [Wu, 2021b]. Currently, in 
light of the evolving emergence of SARS -CoV-2 
variants, it is anticipated that a booster vaccine 
may be is needed. The current available data 
suggests that 50 µg (half dose)  of mRNA -
[ADDRESS_966881] the primary series. This dose 
is also under review by [CONTACT_710909].  As a result, 50 µg of mRNA -1273 
will be used in this study.  
To note: If a different dose of mRNA -1273 is 
approved and recommend ed for use as a 
booster in the US while the study is 
ongoing, the dose of mRNA -1273 booster in 
the study will be adjusted in the HZ/su and 
mRNA -1273 booster cohort to the approved 
dose. The sample size in this cohort will 
also be adjusted accordingly to en sure 
sufficient power to achieve the 
corresponding primary objectives with the 
adjusted dose. The data generated with the 
50 µg of mRNA -1273 booster will then be 
informative and add to the body of safety 
and immunogenicity data at this dose level.  
(Amende d 21 September 2021 ) Justification of Moderna mRNA 1273 
booster dose reduction from 100  µg to 
50 µg.

6.3.2 
Randomization to 
study intervention  The stratification by [CONTACT_710910] a minimum of 75 participants in the ≥

seasonal influenza vaccines and no 
longer be eligible.  
9.5.1 Sample size 
for HZ/su and 
mRNA -1273 study 
cohort  Note: If the dose of mRNA -1273 booster is 
adjusted while the study is ongoing, the 
sample size will be compensated in this 
cohort to ensure that there are enough 
evaluable participants in each group.  Unlike seasonal influenza 
unpredictability, we would still be abl e 
to continue the study and re -estimate 
sample size requirements for the HZ/su 
and mRNA -[ADDRESS_966883]  Any case of suspected, probable, or 
confirmed  myocarditis, pericarditis, or 
myopericarditis should be reported as an 
AESI, even if it does not meet criteria per 
the CDC case definition. The event should 
also be reported as an SAE if it meets any 
seriousness criterion listed in Section 
10.2.2. The fol lowing CDC working case 
definition of myocarditis or pericarditis 
[Gargano, 2021] is provided as guidance.  Text on AESI reporting of myocarditis 
and pericarditis made consistent with 
text in other Moderna protocols 
submitted to IND in past; thereby, also 
requiring moving from SAE section to 
AESI section in protocol.

1.1. Synopsis  
Rationale:  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 
GlaxoSmithKline  Biologicals SA ’s ([COMPANY_004]’s) herpes zoster (HZ) subunit (su) vaccine 
(hereafter referred to as HZ/su) and quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (hereafter 
referred to as Flu D -QIV) when administered sequentially or simultaneously with 
Moderna TX, Inc.’s  (hereby [CONTACT_710911])  messenger ribonucleic acid (mR NA)-
based vaccine booster (hereafter referred to as mRNA -1273 booster) against coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID -19). 
Periodic administration of booster vaccines after primary vaccination with COVID -19 
vaccines are under  consider ation  by [CONTACT_710912][INVESTIGATOR_710858] 2 ( SARS -CoV -2) variants. It is therefore important to 
generate data to support simultaneous administration of mRNA -1273 booster with other 
routinely recommended vaccines to enhance  vaccine coverage rates in the populations at 
high risk of vaccine -preventable diseases . (Amended 21 September 2021 )

21 September 2021  26 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Study rationale  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of [COMPANY_004]’s HZ/su 
and Flu D -QIV when administered sequentially or simultaneously with Moderna’s 
mRNA -[ADDRESS_966912] COVID -19. 
Periodic administration of booster vaccines after primary v accination with COVID -19 
vaccines are under consideration by [CONTACT_710914] -CoV -2 
variants. It is therefore important to generate data to support sim ultaneous administration 
of mRNA -1273 booster vaccine with other routinely recommended vaccines to enhance  
vaccine coverage rates in the populations at high risk of vaccine -preventable diseases.  
(Amended 21 September 2021 ) 
2.2. Background  
Varicella zoster virus  (VZV) causes [ADDRESS_966913] diseases, varicella (chickenpox) that occurs 
shortly after primary VZV infection and is characterized by [CONTACT_348600] a widely 
disseminated rash, and HZ (shingles) that occurs when VZV reactivates from latency and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_310357] a localized, dermatomal rash.  
The typi[INVESTIGATOR_710860] [ADDRESS_966914] -herpetic neuralgia (PHN), an ongoing and 
often debilitating pain that may persist for mo nths or years  [Johnson , 2010] . Other 
complications may include sight -threatening ocular involvement, neurologic disease, and 
cutaneous bacterial superinfection. About hal f of all HZ cases occur in individuals over 
the age of 60, and individuals who reach [ADDRESS_966915] a 50% chance of having HZ 
during their lifetime. Since the loss of VZV -specific T -cell responses as a result of aging 
is associated with a heightened susceptib ility to HZ, vaccination plays an important role 
to reduce the risk of HZ in older adults.  
[COMPANY_004]’s HZ vaccine (commercially available as Shingrix ) is a non -live, recombinant 
subunit vaccine and consists of the VZV -glycoprotein E (gE) as an active ingredient , 
together with the liposome -based adjuvant system (AS) 01 B (AS01 B). The liquid AS is 
used to reconstitute the lyophilized antigen immediately prior to administration. The 
AS01 B consists of the immunostimulants MPL (3 -O-desacyl -4’-monophosphoryl lipid A) 
and QS -21 (a saponin molecule purified from the bark extract of  the Quillaja saponaria  
Molina  tree), which are formulated in liposomes. HZ/su  has been evaluated in older 
adults (≥50 YOA) and in adults (≥18 YOA) who are immunodeficient or 
immunosuppressed  due to disease or therapy and was shown to be highly efficacious, 
elicit strong cellular and humoral immune responses and the reactogenicity and safety 
profile of the vaccine was acceptable [Bastidas , 2019, Cunni ngham , 2018 ; Cunningham , 
2016 ; Dagnew , 2019 ; Lal, 2015 ; López -Fauqued , 2019 ; López -Fauqued , 2021 ]. Shingrix  
is indicated in the U .S. for prevention of HZ in adults aged 50 years and older  and in 
adults aged 18 years and older who are or will be at increased risk of HZ due to 
immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by [CONTACT_710915] .

Protocol Amendment 1 Final  
21 September 2021  27 Influenza is an acute, highly contagious, respi[INVESTIGATOR_710861]. 
There are 2 significant types of influenza (flu) virus that cause disease in humans: Types 
A and B. The influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people (human influenza 
viruses) are responsible for seasonal flu epi[INVESTIGATOR_710862]. Influenza is  mainly spread 
through respi[INVESTIGATOR_710863], young c hildren 
and people with underlying medical conditions. The illness is accompanied by [CONTACT_710916], ranging from mild fatigue to respi[INVESTIGATOR_710864]. Due to frequent genetic and antigenic changes in influen za viruses, 
seasonal vaccines are frequently reformulated with updated viral strains based on annual 
World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Annual influenza vaccination is an 
effective measure to reduce the risk of influenza infection and its com plications.  
[COMPANY_004]’s Flu D -QIV (commercially available as Fluarix Quadrivalent ) is indicated in the 
U.S. for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A subtype 
viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine and  is approved fo r use in persons 
aged 6 months and older.  
COVID -19 is caused by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV -2 [Hu, 2020] . As of 2 6 July 2021, >1 94 million 
confirmed cases and > [ADDRESS_966916] been reported to the WHO [ WHO , 2021].  
Individuals >60  YOA  with comorbidities are more likely to acquire severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_710865]. The pathogenesis of SARS -CoV -2 is still unfolding. 
COVID -19 is characterized  by [CONTACT_710917] (and lymphocyte exhaustio n) with cytokine 
storm seen in severe disease.  A significant decrease in T -cells (including CD4+ and 
CD8+ T -cells), NK -cells and B -cells has been reported.  It has been  suggested that 
COVID -19 may result in impaired immune  responses  (either due to stress or  
lymphopenia), which  may also trigger  VZV reactivation and development of HZ [ CDC , 
2021b; Cao, 2020 ; Wang , 2020 ; Tufan , 2020 ; Elsaie , 2020 ; Lee, 2021; Diez -Domingo , 
2021 ]. 
There are reports that SARS -CoV -2 re-infection can occur suggesting the potential need 
for re -immunization. In addition, the recent emergence of SARS -CoV -2 variants (such 
as-501Y.V1 [B.1.17] in the [LOCATION_008], 501Y.V2 [B.1.351] in South Africa,  
B.1.617.2 [Delta ] in India , etc.) with higher transmission abilities have led to higher 
reports of COVID -[ADDRESS_966917] some emerging variants. A high vaccine 
coverage is needed to curb transmission and subsequent development of SARS -CoV -2 
variants [ Fontanet , 2021; Dougherty , 2021 ]. 
Moderna’s mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine is a novel mRNA -based vaccine 
encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) against SARS -CoV -2. The vaccine includes a 
single mRNA sequence encoding the pre -fusion stabilized Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein of SARS -
CoV -2 (Wuhan strain) . Two doses of 100  µg mRNA -1273 showed 94.1% efficacy at 
preventing COVID -19, including severe disease, and no safety concerns were identified 
[Baden , 2021;]. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency 
Use Authorization (EUA)  to permit the emergency use for ac tive immunization to 
prevent COVID -[ADDRESS_966918] of new SARS -CoV -2 variants on vaccine efficacy, and persistence of 
immunogenicity are still under investigation [Pegu , 2021 ; Doria -Rose , 2021;  Wu, 2021 a].

21 September 2021  28 Moderna  has been  evaluating the use of 50 µg (half dose) or 100 µg  (full dose)  of 
mRNA -[ADDRESS_966919] the Wuhan  strain  and variant viruses tested in all 
participants  [Wu, 2021b] . It is however unclear if the half dose wil l sufficiently boost 
the immune response against other variants that are expected to emerge as the 
pandemic continues to evolve. Additional trials  are underway to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of different dose levels  of the booster vaccines e.g.100 µg of mRNA -
1273  (clinicaltrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), as well as newly developed variant -specific  
vaccines  (clinicaltrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  
As of September 14th, 2021, t he half dose (50 µg) mRNA -[ADDRESS_966920] 6 
months  after the primary series for certain populations at higher risk of severe

Study intervention: HZ/su  
Risk of potential immune -
mediated diseases

administration of HZ/su  pI[INVESTIGATOR_163510] a subset of AEs that include autoimmune diseases 
and other inflammatory and/or neurological disorders of interest 
which may or may not have an autoimmune etiology. To date, 
there is no evidence of an increased risk of pI[CONTACT_28839] s following 
vaccination with HZ/su in evaluated adults 50 YOA or older 
[López -Fauqued , 2019 ]. Based on the theoretical concern that 
vaccination  with an adjuvanted vaccine containing potent 
immunostimulants may interfere with immunological self -
tolerance, pI[INVESTIGATOR_710866].  Close monitoring of pI[INVESTIGATOR_710867].  The 
potential risk of events of possible autoimmune 
etiology to occur is mentioned in the ICF. In addition, 
the ICF advises participants to contact [CONTACT_710919] o r study staff immediately, should any 
symptoms be considered of concern. pI[INVESTIGATOR_710868]/su recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .  
Guillain -Barré Syndrome 
(GBS)  New available information on GBS emerged from a post -
marketing observational study where t he risk of GBS following 
vaccination with HZ/su was assessed in adults aged 65 YOA or 
older enrolled in the Medicare health insurance in the US. An 
increased risk of GBS during the 42 days following vaccination 
was estimated as an excess of 3.13 cases per million doses 
administered. Based on the review of the accumulated body of 
the information that is currently available, [COMPANY_004] considers that the 
strength of the collective evidence is insufficient to determine a 
causal relationship between HZ/su vaccination and GBS, owing to 
substantial limitations and confounding variables.  Close monitoring of GBS will be conducted per 
study protocol and analysis of safety data generated 
through clinical trials and other sources as part of 
pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170] (including GBS). The potenti al risk of events 
of possible autoimmune etiology to occur is 
mentioned in the ICF. In addition, the ICF advises 
participants to contact [CONTACT_710920], should any symptoms be considered of 
concern. pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170] (including GBS) will b e collected up 
to study end.  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
(including anaphylaxis)  Hypersensitivity reactions may occur following exposure to 
allergens from a variety of sources including food, aeroallergens, 
venom, drugs and immunizations. Vaccines are a mi xture of 
compounds and allergic sensitization can occur to any Administration of the study intervention is to be 
preceded by a review of the participant’s medical 
history (especially with regard to previous 
vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable

component. While cutaneous reactions, such as rash or urticaria, 
are common, anaphylactic reactions are very rare [ Ruggeberg , 
2007 ]. events) and a  history -directed clinical examination.  
Anaphylaxis following vaccine administration is a 
contraindication to subsequent vaccination.  
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical 
treatment and supervision should always be readily 
available in case of an anaphylactic event following 
the administration of the study intervention. The 
onset of serious vaccine -related allergic symptoms 
is typi[INVESTIGATOR_366500]. In order to assess and 
adequately treat participants who may have an 
allergic reaction to the st udy intervention, all 
participants will need to remain under observation 
(i.e. visibly followed; no specific procedure required) 
at the study clinic site  for at least 30  minutes after 
each study intervention dose is administered.  
Study Intervention: Flu D-QIV 
Anaphylaxis  Anaphylaxis is an acute, severe, multiorgan system reaction that 
can progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_710869]. It may occur 
following exposure to a variety of allergens, such as food, drugs, 
insect stings and vaccines. The most commonly involved organ 
systems include the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, cutaneous, and 
gastrointestinal systems. Signs and symptoms can include 
generalized urticaria, wheezing, swelling of the mouth and throat, 
difficulty breathing, vomiting, hypotension, decreased level of 
conscio usness, and shock [CDC , 2010 ; Mustafa , 2012 ; 
Ruggeberg , 2007 ]. Hypersensitivity after previous administration of Flu 
D-QIV or influenza vaccines or to any component of 
the vaccine is a contrain dication. It is general 
medical practice to observe patients for 30 minutes 
following vaccination for signs and symptoms of 
anaphylaxis. As with all injectable vaccines, 
appropriate medical treatment and supervision 
should always be readily available in ca se of a rare 
anaphylactic event following administration of the 
vaccine. Treatment given for anaphylaxis may 
include epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], steroids, volume replacement 
therapy, and antihistamines [Ruggeberg , 2007 ].

GBS  Progressive, bilateral, relatively symmetric flaccid paralysis, which 
develops over the course of hours or days up to 3 to 4 weeks, is 
the hallmark of GBS. The respi[INVESTIGATOR_710870], and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_710871] s in 
25% of patients [Yuki, 2012 ]. Sensory abnormalities and 
autonomic dysfunction can also occur [ Haber , 2009 ]. Since 
launch, [ADDRESS_966921] the study 
doctor or study staff immediately, should any 
symptoms be considered of concern.  
Bell’s Palsy  Abrupt onset of unilateral facial weakness or complete paralysis 
of all the muscles on one side of the face, dry eye, pain around 
the ear, an altered sense of taste, hyperacusis (hypersensitivity to 
sounds), or decreased tearing [ Greco , 2012 ]. Most cases are 
idiopathic. Known associations with human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, Sjögren’s 
syndrome, acute otitis media, tumor , hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, and trauma. Pregnancy and certain viral illnesses 
(especially herpes viruses) can also be associated with Bell’s 
palsy. Since launch, thirty -six (36) cases including the MedDRA 
PT term of facial paralysis or facial paresis were received, 
corresponding to a spontaneous reporting frequency of 0.01cases 
per 100,[ADDRESS_966922] to prevent Bell’s palsy. Most 
cases resolve, either spontaneously (71%) [ Greco , 
2012 ] or with tre atment.  
The ICF advises participants to contact [CONTACT_710921], should any 
symptoms be considered of concern.  
Study intervention: mRNA -1273  
Anaphylaxis  These reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once 
per 450,000  vaccinations for vaccines that do not contain 
allergens such as gelatin or egg protein [ Zent, 2002] . Anaphylaxis As a precaution, all participants will remain under 
observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes 
after study intervention administration  with medical 
attention available in case of anaphylaxis .

evidence for vaccine -enhanced disease following vaccination with 
mRNA -1273 . Available data so far since the vaccine received 
EUA do not indicate vaccine -associated disease 
enhancement as a safety concern. Participant’s

4.1. Overall design  
This study is a Phase III, randomized, open -label, controlled, multicenter US -based study 
to evaluate the immune response and safety of both HZ/su in healthy adults 50 YOA and 
older and Flu D -QIV in healthy adults 18 YOA and older when administered sequentially 
or co -administered with mRNA -1273 booster vaccination.  
The study will be conducted in the U.S. and will enr oll participants in 2 main study 
cohorts, HZ/su with mRNA -1273 booster vaccine administered sequentially or 
concomitantly and Flu D -QIV with mRNA -1273 booster vaccine administered 
sequentially or concomitantly, hereafter entitled HZ/su and mRNA -1273 booste r cohort 
and Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 booster cohort, respectively  (Figure 1). 
Potential participants will be triaged initially to e ither study cohort (H Z/su and mRNA -
1273 booster, Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 booster) based upon criteria such as seasonal 
influenza vaccine availability, known  eligibility criteria (such as age and vaccination 
history), and current study enrollment status. Subsequently, enrolled (i.e., having signed 
an informed consent form) and eligible participants in each cohort will be randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio to each of the 2 study groups within each cohort ( Table 8). Staggered 
randomization will be implemented at the beginning of the study for safety monitoring 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
• In the HZ/su and  mRNA -1273 booster cohort, 546 participants will be randomized in 
a 1:[ADDRESS_966960] group 
(HZ/suSeq  group ) will receive the mRNA -[ADDRESS_966961] dose of HZ/su, while the second group 
(HZ/suCoAd group ) will receive the mRNA -[ADDRESS_966962] dose of HZ/su. All participants in the HZ/suSeq group and the 
HZ/suCoAd group will receive the second dose of HZ/su approxima tely [ADDRESS_966963] HZ/su dose. Randomization into each group will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] 
(50 to 59, 60 to 69, and ≥ 70 YOA) and will be set to ensure a minimum number of 
138 participants are assigned to the ≥ 70 YOA stratum, 69 participants to eac h group.  
• In the Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 booster cohort, 1000 participants will be 
randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_966964] group ( FluD -QIVSeq group ) will receive the mRNA -1273 booster dose 
followed appr oximately 2 weeks later by [CONTACT_244512] D -QIV dose, while the second 
group ( FluD -QIVCoAd group ) will receive the mRNA -1273 booster dose co -
administered with the Flu D -QIV dose. Randomization into each group will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_654] (18 to 64 and ≥ 65 YOA) and will be set to target  (Amended 21 
September 2021 ) a minimum number of 150 participants are assigned to the ≥ [ADDRESS_966965] dose of the 
study va ccine with the total duration of study participation approximately 34 and 26 
weeks in the HZ/su and mRNA -1273 booster cohort and Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 
booster cohort, respectively.

4.2. Scientific rationale for study design  
The study was designed after careful considerations of the current healthcare needs and 
expectations related to vaccinations of the adult population in the U .S. 
The U .S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends receipt of 
Shingrix to everyone 50 YOA and older, to prevent shingles and its complications [ CDC , 
2019 ]. 

CONFIDENTIAL  
217670  (ZOSTER -091) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
21 September 2021  41 According to CDC, everyone 6 months of age and older should receive a seasonal 
influen za vaccine every season with rare exceptions. For 202 1-2022, CDC recommends 
use of any licensed, influenza vaccine that is appropriate for the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s age and 
health status, including inactivated influenza vaccine, recombinant influenza vaccine, or 
live attenuated nasal spray influenza vaccine [ CDC , 2021 a]. 
As of summer,  2021, vaccines against COVID -[ADDRESS_966969] 
become an essential part of healthcare  procedures to control the COVID -19 pandemic. 
With the emergence  and spread  of the SARS -CoV-2 virus  variants  that may not be 
sufficiently controlled by [CONTACT_710927] , periodic  administration of booster 
COVID -19 vaccines after primary vaccination is either already recommended for 
specific populations or is under consideration by [CONTACT_710928] . (Amended 21 
September 2021 ) 
Current CDC guidance on the coadministration of COVID -19 vaccines with other routine 
vaccinations is as follows: “COVID -[ADDRESS_966970] to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of 
COVID -19 vaccine and other vaccines on the same day, as we ll as coadministration 
within 14 days. It is unknown whether reactogenicity of COVID -19 vaccine is increased 
with coadministration, including with other vaccines known to be more reactogenic, such 
as adjuvanted vaccines or live vaccines”  [CDC , 2021 c]. 
The current study is designed to provide reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity data 
for when a seasonal influenza virus vaccine or an adjuvanted Herpes Zoster subunit 
vaccine is administered at the same time or two weeks following a potential COVID -19 
mRNA booster vaccine . This is  important needed data expected to help public health 
authorities provide more evidence -based guidance and health care providers to make 
decisions  on such vaccine coadministrations.  
4.2.1.  Rationale for randomization  
This will be an open -label study. Comparative analyses between the 2 study groups will 
only be conducted within each study cohort; therefore, once participants have been 
triaged to their study cohort, to prevent any selection bias in assignment to each study 
group, they will be randomly assigned to either the co -administra tion or sequential study 
group. Consequently, neither study staff nor participants will be aware which group the 
participant will be assigned to prior to the randomization.  
4.3. Justification for dose 
Fluarix Quadrivalent  and Shingrix  are vaccines licensed by t he FDA for use in the U .S 
and shall be administered in this study as per their approved doses and schedule.  
Moderna’s mRNA -[ADDRESS_966971] the 
wildtype SARS -CoV -2 virus and other tested variants, with a safety profile consistent 
CONFIDENTIAL  
217670  (ZOSTER -091) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
21 September 2021  42 with the known profile in earlier clini cal trials [Wu, 2021 b]. Currently, in light of the 
evolving emergence of SARS -CoV -2 variants, it is anticipated that  a booster vaccine may 
be needed . The current available data suggests that  50 µg (half dose)  of mRNA -[ADDRESS_966972] the primary series . This dose is 
also under review by [CONTACT_710929] s. As a result, 50 µg of mRNA -1273  will be 
used in this study.   
To note: If a different dose of mRNA -1273 is approved and recommended for use as a 
booster in the US while the study is ongo ing, the dose of  mRNA -1273 booster in the 
study will be adjusted in the HZ/su and mRNA -1273 booster cohort  to the approved 
dose. The sample size  in th is cohort  will also be adjusted accordingly  to ensure 
suffic ient power to achieve the corresponding primary objectives with the adjusted 
dose. The data generated with the 50 µg of mRNA -1273 booster will then be 
informative and add to the body of safety and immunogenicity data at this dose level.  
(Amended 21 September 2021 ) 
4.4. End of study definition  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she is available for the last 
scheduled contact  [INVESTIGATOR_21094].  
The End of Study is defined as the date of the Last Participant Last Visit ( LPLV , also 
may appear as last subject last visit, LSLV ) or date of last testing results released  of the 
Human Biological Samples related to primary and secondary endpoints , whichever 
comes last. End of Study must be achieved no later than [ADDRESS_966973] satisfy ALL the following criteria at study entry:

6.3. Measures to minimi ze bias: randomi zation  and blinding  
6.3.1.  Participant  identification  
At enrollment, participant identification numbers (IDs, may also be referred to as Subject  
Number) will be assigned sequentially to the participants who consented to participate in 
the study according to the range of participant IDs allocated to each study center. The IDs 
will be assigned upon site’s completion of the screening form in Interact ive Web 
Response System through Interactive Response Tool (IRT).  
6.3.2.  Randomi zation to study intervention  
Within each cohort, participants will be centrally randomized to 1 of the 2 study groups 
(sequential or co -administration) and receive a Randomization Numb er through IRT. At 
randomization, the IRT system will validate the participant’s age. Participants in the 
HZ/su and mRNA -1273 booster cohort will be stratified by [CONTACT_551] (50 to 59 YOA, 60 
to 69 YOA, and ≥ 70 YOA) prior to randomization. Participants in the Flu D -QIV and 
mRNA -1273 booster cohort will also be stratified by [CONTACT_551] (18 to 64 YOA and ≥ 65 
YOA) prior to randomization.  
The target will be to randomize approximately 546 eligible participants in the HZ/su and 
mRNA -1273 booster cohort, who woul d be randomly assigned to one of two study 
groups in a (1:1) ratio (approximately 273 participants in each group). The stratification

21 September 2021  48 6.3.3.  Intervention allocation to the participant  
Intervention (may be referred to as a treatment number or an intervention kit number) 
allocation for each partici pant will be performed through IRT at the first intervention 
visit. Once a participant ID is allocated, IRT will determine the study group and will 
provide the treatment number (kit number) . The treatment number allocated to the 
participant will be recorde d in IRT and treatment number actually administered will be 
recorded in the eCRF. As mRNA -1273 is presented in a multidose vial, the treatment 
number for a subsequent dose of mRNA -1273 to be administered to a different 
participant  from the same vial , will be recorded in a custom table with the dose appended 
(e.g., treatment number/01, treatment number/02 , treatment number/03, etc. ). 
6.3.4.  Blinding and unblinding  
Not applicable as this is an open -label study. Neither the participant nor the investigator 
can choose  which group the participant will be allocated to. Once randomization has been 
completed, all involved parties will be aware of the participant’s group allocation.  
Codes will be used to link the participant and study to each sample  to be tested in the 
laboratory . There will be no link between the study intervention  group s and the identity 
of the participant.

This is an open -label trial. Therefore, this section is not applicable.   
6.4. Study intervention complia nce 
Participants will receive study intervention from the authorized study center staff. The 
date and site of administration of each study intervention dose in the clinic will be 
recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF.

Section is not applicable.  
6.6. Continued access to study intervention after the end of the 
study  
There will be no continuing access to the study intervention after the end of the study.  
6.7. Treatment of overdose  
Any dose of any study vaccine greater than the one required per protocol is considered an 
overdose. All cases of vaccine overdose should be reported as protocol deviations. Any 
signs or symptoms resulting from an overdose should be reported as AEs , or SAEs if 
SAE criteria are met; overdose per se should not be reported  as an AE/SAE. [COMPANY_004]  does 
not recommend specific treatment for an overdose; however, any resulting adverse 
reaction should be treated symptomatically.

At each study visit/contact, the investigator or his/her delegate should question the 
participant about all medications/products / taken, and vaccinations received by [CONTACT_2416].  
The following concomitant medication/product/vaccines  must be recorded in the eCRF:  
• All concomitant medications ongoing at screening and any new concomitant 
medications administered after the first dose of study intervention until the end of the 
last unsolicited AE collection period.  
• All concomitant medication associated with an AE, including vaccines/products, 
administered after the first dose of study interven tion. 
• All concomitant medication leading to discontinuation of the study intervention or 
elimination from the analysis  (e.g., immunosuppressive or immune -modifying 
medications) , including products/vaccines.  
• All concomitant medication which may explain/caus e/be used to treat an 
SAE/AESI /pI[INVESTIGATOR_710879]/products, as defined in Sections 8.3.[ADDRESS_966983] also be recorded in the Expedited Adverse Event report.  
The Medical Monitor  (MM)  should be contact[CONTACT_61519].  
The record of a concomitant therapy should include at a minimum the reason for use, 
dates of administration including start and end dates, dosage information including dose 
and frequency.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of study interve ntion  
‘Discontinuation’ of study interventi on refers to any participant who has not received all 
planned doses of study intervention. A participant who discontinued study intervention  
may continue other study procedures (e.g. safety or immunogenicity), planned in the 
study protocol at the discretion of the investigator.  
The primary reason for premature di scontinuation of the study intervention will be 
documented on the eCRF  as follows:  
• AE requiring expedited reporting to [COMPANY_003] (see Section 10.2.12 ). 
• Unsolicited non -serious AE (see Section 10.2.4 ). 
• Solicited  AE (see Section 10.2.3 ). 
• Not willing to be administered the study intervention.  
• Other (specify).

Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_966984] be confirmed before 
administering  any additional  dose.  
Participants who  no longer meet any applicable eligibility criteria or meet any of the 
criteria listed below should not receive additional doses of study intervention . Such 
participants should be encouraged to continue other study procedures, at the 
investigator ’s discretion (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). All relevant criteria for d iscontinuation of 
study intervention administration must be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Participants who experience any SAE judged to be possibly or probably related to 
study intervention or non -study concomitant vaccine/product, including 
hypersensitivity react ions.  
• Participants who develop any new condition which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], may pose additional risk to the participant if he/she continues to 
participate in the study.  
• Any condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intra muscular 
injection unsafe.  
• Participants who develop any new condition that may impair their ability to adhere to 
required study procedures.  
• Occurrence of a new pI[INVESTIGATOR_710880], exposes the participant to unacceptable risk from 
subsequent vaccination. In such cases, the investigator should use his/her clinical 
judgement prior to administering the next dose of the study intervention. Refer to 
Section 10.2.5  for the definition of pI[CONTACT_28839].  
• Occurrence of a new AESI or the exacerbation of an ex isting AESI that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], exposes the participant to unacceptable risk from 
subsequent doses of study intervention. Refer to Section 10.2.6  for the definition of 
AESI.  
• Pregnancy.  
7.2. Participant discontinuation/ withdrawal from the study  
A participant is considered to have withdrawn from the study if no new study procedure 
has been performed or no new information has been collected for him/her since the date 
of withdrawal/last contact.  
From an analysis perspective, a study ‘withdrawal’ refers to any participant who was not 
available for the concluding contact [CONTACT_285124].  
Investigators or designees will attempt to contact [CONTACT_3445] s who do not return for 
scheduled visits or follow -up. 
All data and samples collected up to and including the date of withdrawal of/last contact 
[CONTACT_103707].  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217670  (ZOSTER -091) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
21 September 2021  51 The investigator will document whether the decisio n to withdraw a participant from the 
study was made by [CONTACT_310596]/herself or by [CONTACT_093]. The primary 
reason for study withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF, based on the list below:  
• AEs requiring expedited  reporting to [COMPANY_003] (see Se ction 10.2.12 ). 
• Unsolicited non -serious AEs (see Section 10.2.4 ). 
• Solicited AE (see Section 10.2.3 ). 
• Withdrawal  by [CONTACT_3445] , not due to an AE*. 
• Migrated/Moved from the study area . 
• Lost to follow -up (see Section 7.3). 
• Sponsor study termination . 
• Other (specify) . 
*If a participant is withdrawn f rom the study because he/she  has withdrawn consent and 
the reason for withdrawal was provided, the investigator must document this reason in the 
eCRF.  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs/SAEs must be clearly 
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigator will 
follow participants who are withdrawn from the study due to an AE/SAE until the event 
is resolved or as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
7.3. Lost to follow -up 
A participant will be considered ‘lost to follow -up’ if he/she fails to return for scheduled 
visits  and cannot be contact[CONTACT_56821]. 
The following actions, unless specified differently in other study -related materials, must 
be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The study center must attempt to cont act the participant and reschedule the missed 
visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining 
the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to 
and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
21 September 2021  52 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are only permitted when necessary for the management 
of immediate safety concerns for the participant.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the MM as soon as they occur or 
when the study team becomes aware of them. The purpose of this communication is to 
determine if the participant(s) should discontinue the study intervention.  
Study procedure s and their timing are summari zed in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
All screening evaluations must be completed,  and the results reviewed before confirming 
that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria.  
The investigator will maintain a log of all participants screened. All relevant information, 
such as confirmation of eligibility and reasons for screening failure will be mentioned in 
this screening  log. 
Procedures conducted as part of routine clinical management (e.g. hematologic profiles), 
and obtained before the participant signed the ICF, may be used for screening and/or for 
establishing a clinical baseline (provided the procedure met protocol sp ecified criteria 
and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA [Section 1.3]) 
The study plans  provide the investigator and site personne l with detailed administrative 
and technical information that does not impact participant safety.  
8.1. Immunogenicity assessments  
Biological samples will be used for research planned in the protocol and for purposes 
related to the improvement, development and quality assurance of the laboratory tests 
described in this protocol.  
Findings in this or future studies may make it desirable to use samples acquired in this 
study for research not planned in this protocol. In this case, all participants in countries 
wher e this is allowed will be asked to give consent to allow [COMPANY_004] or a contracted partner, 
to use the samples for further research. The further research will be subject to prior IRB  
(or independent ethics committee)  approval, if required by [CONTACT_19666].  
Information on further research and its rationale can be obtained from [COMPANY_004].  
Sample testing will be done in accordance with the recorded consent of the individual 
participant.  
By [CONTACT_15094], collected samples will be stored for a maximum of [ADDRESS_966985] study visit. This timeline can be 
adapted based on local laws, regulations or guidelines requiring different timeframes or 
procedures. In all cases, the storage period should be aligned with part icipant’s consent. 
These additional requirements must be formally communicated to, discussed and agreed 
with [COMPANY_004].

the definition of immunological correlate).  
Although no generally accepted immunological correlate of protection has been 
demonstrated so far against influenza (either seasonal or pande mic) with respect to 
specific levels of HI -specific antibody titer post -vaccination induced with inactivated 
influenza virus vaccines, the protective role of antibodies against haemagglutinin and, to 
a lesser extent, neuraminidase, is well established and has been demonstrated both in 
experimentally infected animals and humans [ Brydak , 200 0; Rimmelzwaan , 2008 ]. 
For this reason, the induction of HA -specific antibodies is used as a marker of potential 
vaccine efficacy and the serum HI assay is used to demonstrate this humoral response.

History -directed physical examination will be pe rformed. If the investigator determines 
that the participant’s health on the day of the study intervention administration 
temporarily precludes dosing, the visit will be rescheduled (see Section 5.5). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy test 
Female participants of childbearing potential must perform a urine  pregnancy test on the 
day of and before the administration of any dose of study intervention. Pregnancy testing 
must be do ne even if the participant is menstruating at the time of the study visit. The 
study intervention may only be administered if the pregnancy test is negative.  If a prior 
serum test result is necessary as per IRB requirement, unless the  sample is obtained on 
the day of study intervention , then a urine test must also be performed  on the day of and 
prior to study intervention administration.  
The urine pregnancy test kits (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] hormone test strip) 
provided to the study sites are approved by [CONTACT_1622].  Serum pregnancy testing, if 
required, will be performed as per standard of care.  
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for the information on  study continuation for participants who 
become pregnant during the study.

ZOSTER -048 (201198), ZOSTER -059 (204487), FLU D -QIV-008 (114269), FLU D -

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_967064] deviation used for calculations was at the upper range of what 
has been observed  for both endpoints ; thus, the sample sizes presented below will remain 
for each cohort.  
The type I error to be maintained is 0.025 (one -sided) for each study cohort (HZ/ su and 
mRNA -1273 booster, Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 booster). Study success will be 
evaluated separately for each cohort. For the HZ/su and mRNA -[ADDRESS_967065] be achieved for both hypothesis 3 
and hypothesis 4.  
A total of 1546 participants will need to be enrolled and randomized between the 2 
cohorts.  
9.5.1.  Sample size for HZ/su and mRNA -1273 study cohort  
The global power cons iders meeting the primary objectives in the HZ/su and mRNA -
1273 booster cohort – with 245 evaluable participants in the HZ/suCoAd and HZ/suSeq 
groups the global power is approximately 90%. A GMC ratio of 1.1 between HZ/suSeq 
and HZ/suCoAd is assumed. Assum ing 10% of the participants randomized are non -
evaluable (e.g. due to drop out/protocol violation), approximately 546 participants will 
need to be randomized (273 participants each in the HZ/suCoAd and HZ/suSeq groups).  
Note: If the dose of mRNA -[ADDRESS_967066] er is adjusted while the study is ongoing, the 
sample size will be compensated in this cohort to ensure that there are enough 
evaluable participants in each group.  (Amended 21 September 2021 )

21 September 2021  79 SDs for HZ/su  Dose 2 are taken from the average of the reference co -administration studies ZOSTER -004 (117036), 
ZOSTER -042 (116887), ZOSTER -035 (116889), ZOSTER -048 (201198), ZOSTER -059 (204487), FLU D -QIV-008

preliminary mRNA -1273 Phase I and II data.  
9.5.2.  Sample size for Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 booster study cohort  
The non -inferiority of Flu D -QIV using GMTs (hypothesis 3) will be tested with a [ADDRESS_967068] the null hypothesis if one comparison is not conclusive.  
The non -inferiority of Flu D -QIV using SCR difference for 4 strains (Flu D -QIV 
and/mRNA -1273 booster cohort secondary endpoint, hypothesis 5) will be tested using a 
sequential ap proach, meaning, hypothesis 3 and 4 (GMT, Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 
booster primary endpoint) must be tested and non -inferiority of Flu D -QIV and mRNA -
[ADDRESS_967069] be demonstrated before hypothesis 5 is tested. Both 
tests will use a type  I error of 0.025. Study success on the Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 
booster cohort will be declared if hypothesis 3 and 4 are met. Therefore, the power to 
achieve success for Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 booster cohort is driven by [CONTACT_710955] D -QIV and mRNA -1273 booster cohort.  
A GM C ratio of 1.1 between FluD -QIVSeq and FluD -QIVCoAd is assumed for the 
mRNA endpoint. A GMT ratio of 1.04 between FluD -QIVSeq and FluD -QIV is assumed 
for the flu endpoint. The global power considers meeting both primar y objectives in the 
Flu D -QIV and mRNA -1273 booster cohort –with 450 evaluable participants in the FluD -
QIVCoAd and FluD -QIVSeq groups it is approximately 90.9%.  
The nominal power for the secondary objective to demonstrate non -inferiority in terms of 
SCR difference for each strain in the Flu D -QIV vaccine between FluD -QIVSeq and 
FluD -QIVCoAd groups is at least 85%. Assuming 10% of the participants randomized 
are non -evaluable (e.g. due to drop out/protocol violation), approximately 1000 
participants will n eed to be randomized (500 participants  each in the FluD -QIVCoAd and 
FluD -QIVSeq groups).

10.2.  Appendix 2: Adverse events: definitions and procedures for 
recording, evaluating, follow -up, and reporting  
10.2.1.  Definition of an AE  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence (an unfavorable /unintended sign - including 
an abn ormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) in a clinical 
study participant that is temporally associated with the study intervention. The AE may or 
may not be considered related to the study intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Events meeting the AE definition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after administration of the study 
intervention even though they may have been present before study start.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug, disease or other 
interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either the 
study intervention or a concurrent medication.  
• Signs or symptoms temporally associated with administration of the study 
intervention.  
• Signs, symptoms that require medical attention (e.g. , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], physician 
visits and emergency room visits)  
• Significant failure of an expected pharmacologic or biological action.  
• Pre- or post - intervention events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures  (e.g. invasive procedures, modifica tion of participant’s previous 
therapeutic regimen).  Note th is exception to AE definition for pre -intervention 
study -related events.  
• An SAE related to a G laxoSmithKline concomitant medicine/vaccine  with onset 
any time  after signing the ICF.  Note this exception to AE definition for pre -
intervention study -related events.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217670  (ZOSTER -091) 
Protocol Amendment 1  Final  
21 September 2021  87 • Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments 
that are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study 
will a lso be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
• AEs to be recorded as solicited AEs are described in the Section 10.2.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Events NOT meeting the AE definition  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. , social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing condition s or signs an d/or symptoms present in a participant before 
the first dose of study intervention  (unless an untoward event with onset after 
signing the ICF and before first dose of study intervention that is either  related to a  
study -procedure or is an SAE related to a G laxoSmithKline concomitant 
medicine/vaccine ). These events will be recorded in the medical history section of 
the eCRF.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63336] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed befor e signing the informed consent) that did not worsen from baseline.  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_710960]’s condition.  
10.2.2.  Definition of an SAE 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more 
severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227204]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710889] 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting . Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85299]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710890], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be con sidered serious . 
d. Results in disability/incapacity  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217670  (ZOSTER -091) 
Protocol Amendment 1  Final  
21 September 2021  88 Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , influenza like illness, and accidental trauma 
(e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do 
not constitute a substantial disruption . 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant . 
f. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. , spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  
g. Other situations  
Medical or scientific judgement must be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situation s. Important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710891] n should be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers; intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias; and 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
In addition:  
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis , in addition to being reported as an AESI,  should be 
recorded as medically attended AEs and reported as an SAE, based on the criteria for a 
medically important event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As an S AE, the 
event should be reported to [COMPANY_003] immediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours 
(per Section  10.2.10 ). The investigator will submit any u pdated anaphylaxis case data 
to [COMPANY_003] within 24 hours of it being available. For reporting purposes, a participant who 
displays signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (as follows) should be reported 
as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided  as general guidance for 
investigators and is based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition [ Ruggeberg , 
2007 ]. 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersen sitivity reaction with multi -organ system involvement 
that can present as, or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14274], a severe life -threatening reaction. It may 
occur following exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_716]:  
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involves 2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal: urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, 
generalized pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, and red and 
itchy eyes.

Female participants who become pregnant after the first study intervention dose must no t 
receive subsequent doses of the study intervention but  may continue other study 
procedures at the discretion of the investigator.  
Female participants who become pregnant after administration of the study intervention 
may continue the study at the discret ion of the investigator.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any abnormal pregnancy 
outcome or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will 
be recorded and reported as an SAE. Please refer to Section 10.2.[ADDRESS_967083] the investigator immediately should they  
experience any signs or symptoms they perceive as of concern . 
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the investigator’s responsibility to review all 
documentation (e.g. , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory and diagnostics reports ) related 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE on the eCRF. The investigator may not send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_003] instead of appropriately completing the eCRF.  
There ma y be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_710896]. In this case, all participant identifiers will be blinded on copi[INVESTIGATOR_710897]. 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagno sis pertaining to the event, based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE instead of individual signs/symptoms.  
An eDiary will be used in this study to capture solicited local or systemic events. The 
participant should be trained on how and when to complete the eDiary . 
Anyone who measures local  or systemic events and  who will record the event in the 
eDiary should be trained on using the eDiary . This training must be documented i n the 
participant’s source record.  Site staff will monitor eDiary compliance  and the investigator 
will review and verify eDiary entries during discussions with the participant.  
Any unreturned eDiary will be sought from the participant  through telephone call(s) or 
any other convenient procedure.

21 September 2021  103 [IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of causality  
The investigator must assess the relationship between  study intervention  and the 
occurrence of each unsolicited AE/SAE using clinical judgement. Where several different 
interventions were administered, the investigator should specify, when possible, if the 
unsolicited AE/SAE could be causally related to a sp ecific intervention. When a causal 
relationship to a specific study intervention cannot be determined, the investigator should 
indicate the unsolicited AE/SAE to be related to all interventions.  
Alternative possible causes, such as the natural history of u nderlying disease, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study intervention  will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult 
the IB and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for m arketed products to assist in 
making his/her assessment.  
Causality should be assessed by [CONTACT_163586]:  Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the unsolicited AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_285150]?  
YES:  There is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention contributed to the 
AE.  
NO: There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administration of the study intervention. There are other, more likely causes 
and administr ation of the study intervention is not suspected to have 
contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined ‘serious’ (see Section 10.2.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by [CONTACT_227274].  
Possible contributing factors include:  
• Medical history.  
• Other medication.  
• Protocol -required procedure.  
• Other procedure not required by [CONTACT_760].  
• Lack of efficacy of the study intervention, if applicable.  
• An error in study intervention administration.  
• Other cause (specify).  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_003]. However, it is very important to record 
an assessment of causality for every event before submitting the Expedited Adverse 
Events Report to [COMPANY_003].

A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Women not considered as women of childbearing potential  
• Premenarchal * 
Menarche is the first onset of menses in a young female. Menarche is normally 
preceded by [CONTACT_330548].  
Additional evaluation should be considered if a participant’s fertility s tatus is unclear 
(e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention.  
*Note: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the study (e.g., a 
premenarchal female participant  experiences menarche) or the risk of pregnancy 
changes (e.g., a female participant who is not heterosexually active becomes active), 
the participant must discuss this with the investigator, who should determine a highly 
effective method of contraception. If reproductive status is questionable, additional 
evaluation should be considered.  
• Premenopausal female with ONE of the following:  
− Documented total hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
− Current b ilateral tubal ligation or occlusion  
Note: Documentation can come from the study center  personnel’s review of 
participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 mon ths without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in  
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use a 
non-hormonal, highly effective contraception method if they wish to continue their 
HRT during the study.  Alternatively, confirmation of post -menopausal status before 
study enrolment should be established .

contraception should be used.)  
Male partner sterilization  prior to the female participant’s entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner 
for that participant,  
(The information on the male sterility can come from the study center  personnel’s review of the participant’s medical

Sexual abstinence  
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse 
during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention . The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.)    
Female participants must practice adequate contraception for [ADDRESS_967087] on the day of vaccination, and agree to

Amendment 1  Final  21 September 2021  
Amendment 1 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment : 
This amendment is intended to modify the dose of each mRNA -[ADDRESS_967095] of main changes in the protocol and their rationale  
Section # and Name  [CONTACT_11029]  
2.2 Background  Moderna has been  is evaluating the use of 50 µg 
(half dose) or  100 µg (full dose)  of mRNA -[ADDRESS_967096] the 
Wuhan strain and variant viruses tested in all 
participants [ Wu, 2021b].  It is however unclear 
if the half dose will sufficiently boost the 
immune response against other variants that Background for consideration of 
the 50 µg dose of the mRNA -
1273 vaccine.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217670  (ZOSTER -091) 
Protocol Amendment 1  Final  
21 September 2021  117 Section # and Name  [CONTACT_710979]. Additional trials are 
underway to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of diff erent dose levels of the 
booster vaccines e.g.100 µg of mRNA -1273 
(clinicaltrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), as well as 
newly developed variant -specific vaccines 
(clinicaltrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
As of September 14th, 2021, the half dose (50 
µg) mRNA -[ADDRESS_967097] 6 months after the 
primary series for certain populations at 
higher risk of severe COVID -19 disease. [JCVI 
2021] The half dose mRNA -1273 booster is 
under evaluation by [CONTACT_710970]. 
(Amended 21 September 2021 ) 
4.[ADDRESS_967098] the current 
regulatory environment.  
4.3 Justification of 
dose.  Moderna’s mRNA -[ADDRESS_967099] the 
wildtype  SARS -CoV-2 virus and other tested 
variants, with a safety profile consistent with the 
known profile in earlier clinical trials [Wu, 2021b]. 
Currently, in light of the evolving emergence of 
SARS -CoV-2 variants, it is anticipated that a 
booster vaccine may be is needed. The current 
available data suggests that 50  µg (half dose)  
of mRNA -[ADDRESS_967100] the primary 
series. This dose is also under review by [CONTACT_710971] 
1273 booster dose reduction 
from 100 µg to 50  µg. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
217670  (ZOSTER -091) 
Protocol Amendment 1  Final  
21 September 2021  118 Section # and Name  [CONTACT_710980].  As a result, 50 
µg of mRNA -1273 will be used in this study.  
To note: If a different dose of mRNA -1273 is 
approve d and recommended for use as a 
booster in the US while the study is ongoing, 
the dose of mRNA -1273 booster in the study 
will be adjusted in the HZ/su and mRNA -1273 
booster cohort to the approved dose. The 
sample size in this cohort will also be adjusted 
accordingly to ensure sufficient power to 
achieve the corresponding primary objectives 
with the adjusted dose. The data generated 
with the 50 µg of mRNA -1273 booster will then 
be informative and add to the body of safety 
and immunogenicity data at this dose level.  
(Amended 21 September 2021 ) 
6.3.2 Randomization to 
study intervention  The stratification by [CONTACT_710972]  a minimum of 75 participants in the ≥ [ADDRESS_967101] 
mostly already received their 
seasonal influenza vaccines and

9.5.1 Sample size for 
HZ/su and mRNA -1273 
study cohort  Note: If the dose of mRNA -1273 booster is 
adjusted while the study is ongoing, the 
sample size will be compensated in this  
cohort to ensure that there are enough 
evaluable participants in each group.  Unlike seasonal influenza 
unpredictability, we would still 
be able to continue the study 
and re -estimate sample size 
requirements for the  HZ/su and 
mRNA -[ADDRESS_967102]  Any case of suspected, probable, or confirmed 
myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis 
should be reported as an AESI, even if it does 
not meet criteria p er the CDC case definition. 
The event should also be reported as an SAE 
if it meets any seriousness criterion listed in 
Section 10.2.2. All cases of myocarditis or 
pericarditis with onset less than 7 days following 
mRNA -1273 administration, in addition to b eing 
reported as an AESI, should be recorded as 
causally related SAEs, based on the criteria for a 
medically important event, unless the event meets 
other serious criteria. As an SAE, the event 
should be reported to [COMPANY_003] immediately and in all 
circumstances  within 24 hours (per Section 
10.2.12). The investigator will submit any updated 
myocarditis or pericarditis case data to [COMPANY_003] within 
24 hours of it being available. For reporting 
purposes, to ensure consistent case 
ascertainment, t  The following CDC workin g 
case definition of myocarditis or pericarditis 
[Gargano, 2021] is provided as guidance. 
should be used : Text on AESI reporting of 
myocarditis and pericarditis 
made consistent with text in 
other Moderna protocols 
submitted to IND in past; 
thereby, also re quiring moving

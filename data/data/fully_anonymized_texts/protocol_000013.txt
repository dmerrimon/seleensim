IX. Study Device Information 
 
EZ Pass Suture Passer:  
The EZ Pass Suture Passers are comprised of a cannulated handle and shaft. A nitinol wire or monofilament can be fed through the handle and shaft to facilitate 
suture passing. The thumb wheels on the handle allow for the nitinol wire or 
monofilament to be advanced around the tissu
e, and then retracted. There are seven 
different shaft tips, which have varying orientations to be used in a variety of procedures. The 
shaft tip orientations include: 90° Up, 45° Up, 45° Dogleg Up, 70° Right, 70° Le ft, 30° Right, and 
30° Left. To add stability and strength to the EZpass handle, a design change was implemented to 
secure the handle halves together using 8 stainless steel screws instead of the previously used 
ultrasonic welding.  See Appendix for specifi c SKUs associated with the EZPass 
Suture  Passers.

submitted to the Sponsor in a timely manner.  The Investigator or Designee will also promptly provide the Sponsor with any additional requested information required for the Sponsor to comply with regulatory requirements.  If appli cable per 
their reporting requirements, the Investigator or Designee will also report applicable adverse event(s) to their IRB or EC.  
The following definitions are from ISO [ZIP_CODE]: 2020 . 
Classification of the Event  
Adverse Event (AE):  
An adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device and whether anticipated or unanticipated.  
Note 1:   This definition includes events related to the investigational medical 
device or the comparator.

Note 2:   This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.  
Note 3:   For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices  or comparators .  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
A Serious Adverse Event is an adverse event that led to any of the following:  
• death,  
• serious deterioration in the health of the subject, users or other persons as 
defined by [CONTACT_10980]:  
• a life -threatening illness or injury, or  
• a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function including 
chronic diseases, or  
o in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body 
function,  
• led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect including physical or mental impairment.  
Note:   Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre- existing condition, or a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
Adverse Device Effect (ADE):  
An Adverse Device Effect is an adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.  
Note 1:   This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the medical device.  
Note 2:   This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the medical device.  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE):  
A Serious Adverse Device Effect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect is a serious adverse device effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report.

Note 1 : Anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an effect which by 
[CONTACT_6073], incidence, severity or outcome has been identified in the risk analy sis 
report.  
Device Deficiency  (DD):  
A Device Deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect 
to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, usability, safety or performance.  
Note:  Device Deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and .inadequacy in 
the information supplied by [CONTACT_143143] .  
It is important to document in the study also all device deficiencies that could have led to a medical occurrence but  did not lead to an adverse event.  
Serious Health Threat  
Signal from any adverse event or device deficiency that indicates an imminent risk of death or a serious deterioration in the health of subjects, users or other persons, and that requires prompt remedial action for other subjects, users or 
other persons.  
Note 1:  This would include events that are of significant and unexpected nature 
such that they become alarming as a potential serious health hazard or possibly 
of multiple deaths occurring at shor t intervals.  
Intensity of Symptoms  
Mild:  
The subject is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated.  The event is of little concern to the subject and/or little clinical significance.  The event is not expected to have any effect on the subject’s overall health or well -being.  
Moderate:  
The subject has discomfort enough to cause interference with or a change in usual activities.  The event is of some concern to the subject’s health or well -being 
and may require medical intervention and/or cl ose follow -up. 
Severe:  
The event interferes considerable with the subject’s usual activities.  The event is of definite concern to the subject and/or poses substantial risk to the subject’s health or well -being.  The event is likely to require medical intervention and/or 
close follow -up and may be incapacitating or life threatening.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345453].  
Note:  The term “severe” refers to the intensity of the event and can be used with 
any event, without regard to whether or not it meets the criteria for being classified as “serious” or “unanticipated”.  For example, a subject can have a severe headache, but it i s not a serious event.

Outcome Definitions  
The outcome is in relationship to the Adverse Event, not the treatment rendered 
for the event (if any).  
Resolved:  
The adverse event has been resolved and/or no further treatment is required to treat the reported condition or illness.   
Tolerated:  
The adverse event will most likely never be resolved.  The subject “tolerates” the 
illness or condition as a matter of life.  
Pending:  
Treatment or diagnostic studies were prescribed for the adverse event and the 
outcome of the adverse event is not yet known.  
Reoperation:  
The adverse event resulted in reoperation of the study joint, but the reoperation 
did not include removal of a study device.  
Death:  
The outcome indicates the subject died as a direct result of the reported adverse 
event.  
Review of Reported Events  
The Sponsor will review the investigator’s assessment of all reported events submitted to determine and document in writing their seriousness and relationship to the study device and related procedures required by [CONTACT_3181].  In case of disagreement, t he sponsor will consult the investigator for clarification and 
correction if required.  If the disagreement cannot be resolved, the sponsor shall 
communicate both opi[INVESTIGATOR_682301] .  
XIII. Monitoring 
Prior to initiating the clinical study, the Sponsor may conduct a site qualification  
visit to ensure the Investigator(s) and study staff understands the study protocol and requirements and have adequate time and resources to im plement and 
conduct the study.  Prior to study initiation, the Investigator must have a fully 
executed CTA and IRB or EC approval of the study protocol and the study 
Informed Consent.  
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will conduct periodic centr al 
monitoring and maintain contact [CONTACT_682312], in accordance with the Sponsor’s policies and

procedures.  The Sponsor will address any identified non- compliance with the 
executed CTA, study protocol, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
If onsite monitoring visit(s) are deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1034], the 
Investigator will permit representatives of the Sponsor’s monitoring team to have direct access to inspect all source data/documents, st udy documents/binders, 
study subject case report forms, corresponding sections of study subject medical/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], and any other documents relevant to the study.   
XIV. Risk Analysis  
This post -market clinical study is classified as minimal risk, and ther e are no 
additional or anticipated risks specific to study participation other than the potential loss of confidentiality. There are no experimental procedures in this study, and participation in this study is not anticipated to affect the medical treatmen t of enrolled subjects.  
When used in accordance with product labeling, the risks associated with the us e 
of the EZ Pass Suture Passer and the Precision Flexible Reamer are like that of any other suture assistance instrumentation. These risks are either general surgical or anesthesia risks or risks associated with the subject procedure/study device. Unanticipated adverse events can occur.  
XV. Statistical Methods  
Data collected in the study will be summarized descriptively. Descriptive 
summaries will form the basis of study reports and will generate an overall summary of the clinical evaluation of the EZPass Suture Passer and Precision Flexible Reamer instrumentati on.
 
Continuous data (e.g. age) will be summarized through means, medians, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) over time 
periods of interest. Categorical data (e.g. gender) will be summarized using 
counts, percentages and 95% confidence limits over time periods of interest. 
Summaries of complications data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. Subgroup summaries will be generated as needed either by [CONTACT_682313] (e.g. male vs. female) or by  [CONTACT_682314] -points (e.g. 
body mass index (BMI) ranges). Patient confidentiality will be protected at all times, and patient identifiers will not be included in data summaries

XVI. Quality Control & Quality Assurance  
The study  is conducted in accordance  with  the Declaration of Helsinki and the ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]: 2020.  
The Investigator will be required to permit representative(s) of the Sponsor’s 
monitoring team to inspect all Case Report Forms and corresponding sections of the study patients office records and/or hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_358240].  These 
audits will be done for quality assurance purposes, i.e. verifying adherence to the Clinical Investigation Plan and the completeness and accuracy of the data being entered on the Case Report Forms.  
The Clinical Invest igation Plan will be provided to all participating study centers.  
The Investigators will be fully trained in the proper reporting and submission of trial data prior to patient enrolment.  Completed Case Report Forms will be 
reviewed before entering the data into a central database by [CONTACT_1034].  
The Clinical Study Manager is responsible for generating data queries for missing or unclear data if needed.  It is the responsibility of the Clinical Study Manager to 
ensure data quality.  
There are regular meetings between the Investigators and Zimmer Biomet Clinical Affairs staff.  Written correspondence to all sites is used to inform the 
Investigators of routine study details and to update them on study status.

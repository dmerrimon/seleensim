IDE G120202   Attachment [ADDRESS_406838] injury (SCI) is a devastating disease , which exerts a 
disproportionate medical, social, and economic toll on society . Effective 
treatments are urgently needed for SCI, whether for immediate relief of 
symptoms or lon ger-lasting functio nal recovery. It (SCI)  produces chronic loss 
of motor control, sensation and autonomic regulation below the level of the 
injury. Frequently disconnection is not total and some degree of below injury 
function remains. Unfortunately, the remaining functional  connection can 
cause additional problems for patients (at least 20% of all SCI patients). In 
addition, dangerous rises in blood pressure can be produced by [CONTACT_329332]. This phenomenon is known as autonomic dysreflexia (AD). It occurs in 
48% to 9 0% of patients with tetraplegia or high quadriplegia . 
This study investigates  the neurosurgical procedure of deep brain stimulation 
(DBS) in the midbrain’s periaqueductal and periventricular gray region 
(PAG/PVG). The use of DBS in PAG/PVG for drug -refractory non -metastatic 
chronic pain has been reported in the biomedical literatur e for at least several 
hundred patients, and continues to be used in many countries, including 
[LOCATION_013] and the [LOCATION_008]. A small proportion of reported cases (about 
21) of DBS applied at any brain site involved pain from spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] 
(SCI), and  only 3 or 4 for the PAG/PVG. These reports, some of them from the 
1970s, did not describe systematic studies. Extensive, modern pain testing was 
not done. The stimulation was not given time to work (it could require several 
weeks for effects to appear). T he pathologies were in most cases inadequately 
characterized.  Also, some preclinical evidence suggests PAG/PVG -DBS can 
also improve other SCI symptoms, such as motor deficits and autonomic 
dysreflexia (AD), which were never examined . The present study is d esigned 
to provide these missing details.  
Thus, our study seeks to  examine  whether the safety and efficacy of prolonged 
DBS for SCI are sufficient to warrant its larger -scale study as therapy for pain 
and AD in SCI patients.  
Trial Design   Controlled, open  label , non-randomized, investigation in twelve (12) 
participants . 
 Two sites: (1) Miami V eterans Affairs  Medical Center; (2) University of 
Miami Miller School of Medicine.  
 Informed Consent will be obtained prior to enrollment in the study . 
Approximate 
Duration of Patient 
Participation   52 weeks (±7 days) for each subject from Initial Visit until Final Visit.  
 After  implantation of the DBS device  on the 8 th week,  scheduled safety 
and efficacy assessments will be performed at intervals of 4 weeks until 
study week 24, and at intervals of 8 weeks thereafter.

Duration of Study   End of Study is Defined as Last Subject’s Final Visit  
 Total period of study is [ADDRESS_406839] enrolled.  
Study Objective(s)  Primary:  to determine whether Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) applied 
bilaterally or unilaterally in the midbrain periaqueductal -periventricular gray 
(PAG/PVG) region provides acute or long -term relief of chronic SCI 
associated pain and autonomic dysreflexia.  
Seconda ry: to assess the clinical effects of DBS on  autonomic functioning ; to 
determine with Activa PC+S whether local field potentials in the PAG/PVG 
can be used to predict the efficacy of DBS in this region

Number of Study 
Centers  Two sites (VA Medical Center & University of Miami - Miller School of 
Medicine)  
Concomitant 
Medication  Concomitant medications and treatments or procedures pertinent to the study 
treatment or to any adverse events will be recorded including:  
1) name [CONTACT_61144], treatment, or description of procedure,  
2) start and end dates and times, and  
3) clinical indication and/or findings.   
Investigational drugs and any other intervention (not part of the guidelines for 
management of SCI) known to have a potential impact on outcome will be 
prohibited.  
Participants  will be allowed to utilize over -the-counter drugs such as NSAIDs, 
acetaminophen and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. Their use will be documented in the week ly pain 
assessments. A list of “allowed” medications will be provided to study 
participants.  After the surgery, patients will be allowed to stay on the protocol 
if they take Tramadol (50 -100 mg, 2 times a day for up to 2 weeks) as a rescue 
drug in addition  to their stable medication.  
The patient must be taking pain medication to maintain a stable level of 
medication from 4 weeks before surgery to 12 weeks after (the primary 
endpoint), except on the day of surgery. On the day of the surgery, in the 
presence of a physician  who can provide immediate backup pain control if 
needed, medications will be stopped until the acute effects of DBS on analgesia 
have been evaluated.  
On week 20 during a patient visit under medical supervision , patients will be 
instructed to  take one fewer tablet or a smaller dose tablet, wait 4 hours and 
then see if their pain becomes worse.  If it does become worse, they may take 
medication to reach the original dose. Subsequently, they may follow this 
procedure at home or during the follow ing visits.  
 
 
Study Intervention  (Device Usage Protocol)  
Device  The study will use PMA authorized , Class III, implantable, Neurostimulation 
Systems for Deep Brain Stimulation.  The Medtronic Activa PC and PC+S 
DBS device systems will be used as designed  without any modifications.

Device Implant 
Procedure  
 
 Participants  presenting to the trial site with a history and mechanism 
consistent with chronic SCI with neuropathic pain below the level of injury, 
will be assessed using defined screening tests. Elig ible participants  will also 
undergo a multi -step consent process.  
Upon successful consent, trained and certified study personnel will perform 
imaging and neurological systems exams. The neurological systems exams 
will be utilized as the baseline measure of  neurological status including 
neuropathic pain and autonomic dysreflexia.  
Upon successful completion of screening and baseline measurements, 
participants will undergo s urgery to implant unilateral or bilateral DBS Leads 
(Model 3387S) , extensions (Model # [ZIP_CODE] or [ZIP_CODE]) and implantable 
neurostimulator (IFN) (Model [ZIP_CODE], or Model [ZIP_CODE]) .  
After successful implantation and one week  recovery, subjects  will participate 
for [ADDRESS_406841] serve 
as their own controls.  
Frequency  One-time implantation of Activa PC or Activa PC+S Deep Brain Stimulation  
device system . Continuous stimulation , or cycled in 12 -hour on/off periods, 
or in shorter on/off periods, for ~ 40 weeks.  Voltage range 0.1 -10V.  
Safety Evaluation  1) Although preclinical data and clinical experience suggests DBS and 
device implantation is relatively safe, several adverse events are 
possible and will be noted,  
2) Comprehensive pain, motor and autonomic assessment will occur on 
screening and enrollment (ba seline)  and then at every on-site visit  week 
throughout the study.  
3) The correct functioning of the DBS apparatus will be monitored  at 4-
week intervals after implantation  until study week 24, and at 8 -week 
intervals thereafter .  
4) Pain Assessments using the I SCIPDS:B will evaluate development of 
neuropathic pain syndromes.  
Secondary outcomes  1) Tilt table response exam  
2) Autonomic Standards Assessment (BP, HR, sympathetic skin response)   
 
 
 
 
 
IDE G120202   Attachment [ADDRESS_406842], bowel and sexual function 
will also be scored . 
Comprehensive testing sessions will analyze vagal  and sympathetic 
influences on the cardiovascular system, measuring blood pressure and heart 
rate variability (power spectrum analysis) during sit -up or tilt -table 
challenge.  
Assessment of motor and non -pain somatosensory function will be done 
during visit s every 4 weeks. Clinical sensory testing will include Light 
Touch and Pin Prick tests defined in the ASIA standards [1]. The Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI -1a) will also be used, to assess emotional 
function in neuropathic pain [4]. If BDI assessment (>30 ) suggests suicidal 
thoughts, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale will be used in 
consultation with a clinical psychologist.

7.[ADDRESS_406851] injury (SCI) entails loss or abnormality of autonomic regulation, motor control and 
body sensation at and below the dermatomal level of injury. When disconnection is incomplete, some 
degree of below-injury function remains. About one half of all new cases in the US are incomplete [5]. In 
principle, surviving functional connections are a hopeful sign, offering a target for possible therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as 
well as giving the patient some possibility of control distal to the lesion. In practice, unfortunately, these 
connections often entail dysfunction. For example, persistent pain below or at the injury level is experienced 
in 2/[ADDRESS_406852] 1/3rd of this sub-population faces a severely 
reduced quality of life [6]; some authorities consider this rate to be much higher, based on surveyed pain 
ratings [7]. It was reported that 23% of a sample patients with cervical or high thoracic SCI and 37% with 
low thoracic or lumbosacral SCI would sacrifice sexual, bowel and bladder function for good pain relief 
[8]. 
SCI pain is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a mixture of nociceptive pain, which is caused by [CONTACT_329336]’ 
receptors, and neuropathic pain, which is caused by [CONTACT_329337]. The neuropathic pain 
of SCI is most frequently treated by [CONTACT_329338]. There is good evidence from randomized control 
trials for some degree of effectiveness of gabapentin [9-11 ] and pregabalin [12,13], with weaker evidence 
for valproic acid [ 14]. Tricyclic antidepressants are also used to control SCI pain, but the supporting 
evidence is not as strong. Thus amitriptyline has proved somewhat effective when the patient is depressed 
[15,16], but trazodone was reported not to reduce post-SCI neuropathic pain more than placebo [ 17]. 
Traditional analgesics are also useful. Morphine can provide effective relief of neuropathic pain due to SCI, 
and can be combined with the alpha-[ADDRESS_406853] clonidine for this purpose [18,19]. Subarachnoid or epi[INVESTIGATOR_329294]-term relief [ 20]. For the musculoskeletal pain in SCI, which 
nociceptive, antispasticity agents are frequently used; intrathecal baclofen, for example, can be fairly 
effective [21,22]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_329295], pharmacological treatment for the pain of SCI 
remains inadequate. Low effectiveness, tolerance, side effects or difficulties with prolonged local 
administration (e.g., subdural) are among problems encountered [ 23].  
Auto
nomic functioning after SCI depends on the injury level. Visceral efferents are damaged directly by 
[CONTACT_20169]-thoracic or sacral injuries. Higher control of autonomic function is degraded after cervical or high 
thoracic SCI, when only vagal control remains. Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a frequent consequence of 
cervical or high thoracic injuries. It mostly occurs when the lesion is above the 6th thoracic segment. Its 
estimated frequency is 48-90% in patients with tetraplegia or high quadriplegia [ 24-26]. AD is a cluster of 
symptoms caused by a massive sympathetic outflow, which includes elevated blood pressure, headache, 
flushing, sweating above the lesion level and abnormal heart rhythms.  It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_329296]. Distension of bladder or colon, such as occurs from loss 
of control of evacuation, may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_329297].  It can occur sporadically, triggered several times each day, 
but sometimes it lasts for many days, since the patient is generally unaware of aggravating stimuli below 
the injury level.  
Various categories of antihypertensive agents are used for symptomatic control of AD, in particular nitrates 
(e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_329298]), calcium blockers (e.g., nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) and selective alpha-adrenergic antagonists 
(e.g., prazosin, terazosin) [ 27]. In the short-term, these treatments are generally adequate. However, because 
AD can present as an acute crisis, long-term treatment with an effective blocking dose is poorly matched 
to the breakthrough of symptoms and their chronic sequelae. Alpha-adrenergics, for example, in addition 
to their adverse acute effects and contraindications, produce receptor upregulation with long-term use. 
Additional problems are specific to SCI. Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_329299] a transmitter at sphincter muscles of hollow organs. Blockade of its principal alpha-1 receptors can 
therefore exacerbate functional deficits in SCI.

      Page 20 of 58 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly being used instead of drugs (or in combination with them) for 
several neurological problems. Its most common application at present is to control the symptoms of 
advanced Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor by [CONTACT_329339]-thalamic 
nucleus [28,29], which has been provided to well over one hundred thousand patients worldwide. Patients 
can greatly reduce or eliminate their intake of L-dopa or other drugs (anticholinergics, dopamine 
antagonists, etc.).  DBS, because it is targeted to a particular brain region, considerably reduces the 
possibility of adverse neural and systemic effects compared to most pharmacological approaches. Since the 
choice of DBS targets has a good basis in scientific investigation, the treatment is not merely empi[INVESTIGATOR_10477]. 
Another key advantage is that the dose can be instantaneously modulated in various ways (e.g., voltage, 
pulse width, pulse frequency), including immediate stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Initial high cost seems to be the main 
disadvantage. Discounted over the predicted lifespan of the average patient, however, costs may compare 
favorably with drugs, especially if the lower probability of adverse effects is taken into account. 
Extensive experience with DBS in motor disorder patients has led to various technical improvements. 
Failures due to equipment breakdown, infection or improper targeting, for example, are becoming rare. 
This success has led to consideration of DBS for other chronic neurologic maladies, such as obsessive-
compulsive disorder, depression and epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] [ 30]. It has also prompted a reconsideration of DBS as a 
treatment for chronic, drug-refractory pain of various sorts, which was used for many years prior to the 
advent of DBS for motor disorders [ 31]. DBS for pain control can target several different brain regions. 
One main target is the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) together with the nearby [CONTACT_329340] 
(PVG); another is the sensory thalamus (ST).  Reported long-term pain alleviation rates have been higher 
with PAG/PVG stimulation (79%) than with ST stimulation (58%) [ 31]. Cortical sites are also sometimes 
targeted for pain (Nguyen et al.), but these have apparently not worked well for SCI pain [ 32] and are not 
considered further here. 
7.[ADDRESS_406854] and Monitoring of Study: 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, and monitored according to Good Clinical 
Practices as outlined in 21 CFR 312 Subpart D and E6 ICH: Good Clinical Practice Guidance and other 
applicable regulatory requirements. 
7.3 Over view of Target Patient Population: 
Veterans or non-veterans will be recruited, for a total of 12 participants. They will be men or women, fluent 
in English, of average literacy, 22-60 years of age, with an incomplete or complete SCI and neuropathic 
pain at or below the level of injury. We anticipate few or no females, because females are about 20% of the 
general injured population in the US [5 ] and because females are under 20% in most military branches and 
were fewer in previous years. The data obtained from this study may provide additional data to warrant 
extension of similar, future studies to additional populations. 
[ADDRESS_406855]. Ian Hentall, one of the co-investigators.  These animal studies 
were based on the hypothesis that brainstem raphe nuclei function to promote repair [ 33]. Raphe nuclei 
release serotonin nearly ubiquitously in brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Serotonin is a neurotrophic molecule as a 
well as a classical neurotransmitter [ 34]. Along with 5-HT, many raphe neurons co-release peptides with 
neurotrophic effects, e.g., thyrotropin releasing hormone, galanin [35,36]. Some raphe neurons are known 
to be excited by [CONTACT_329341], e.g., pain, hypotension, circulating 
cytokines [ 37], suggesting a restorative feedback loop. This model can be extended to midbrain raphe nuclei 
IDE G120202   Attachment 17 .2 
Supplement S007 Clinical Protocol 
      Page 21 of 58 with ascending divergent projections. After experimental fluid-percussion brain injury, it was found that 
one week of stimulation in the median or dorsal raphe nucleus boosted behavioral recovery (forelimb 
reaching, water-maze learning) and anatomical recovery (forebrain white matter, hippocampal neuron 
density) [ 33]. Molecular mechanisms for these effects are currently under investigation. For example, spi[INVESTIGATOR_329300] (cAMP), which are 
greatly reduced by [CONTACT_329342], were returned to normal by [ADDRESS_406856]-injury, 
as were various downstream protein signaling targets of cAMP (unpublished). 
The earlier SCI work of this laboratory focused on acute thoracic (T8) injuries, testing both the PAG and 
the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM), which is the PAG’s main hindbrain relay to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Several days 
of stimulation in either region partially restored motor performance and normalized mechanical allodynia 
in forelimbs [38,39]. In histological analysis, myelination of white matter around the injury zone was seen 
to have recovered significantly when either site was stimulated. The NRM also significantly increased 
serotonin-containing terminals in gray matter.  
In recent unpublished studies with PAG stimulation, PAG stimulation was tested in rats with an acute 
cervical (C5) injury. One week of intermittent stimulation yielded long-term improvement in AD 7 weeks 
later, as measured by [CONTACT_329343] (Figure 1).

Both the chronic and the acute treatments in these studies had the histochemical effect of reducing 
immunostaining to calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) near the injury. Since CGRP is a key pain 
transmitter in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and is increased by [CONTACT_329342] [ 40], this potentially important pain-reducing

Conclusion 
DBS in the midbrain PAG/PVG reverses ongoing pain in man. However, the data are too few to judge 
safety or efficacy for SCI pain.  Because current drug or cognitive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_329302] a 
significant proportion of cases, a renewed assessment of DBS in the PAG/PVG is justified. The assessment 
should involve a detailed characterization of pathology, treatment and outcome. Pain alleviation could also 
reduce ongoing autonomic dysreflexia [ 41], while preclinical findings suggest that permanent partial 
improvements in pain, autonomic deficits and motor performance could occur after prolonged stimulation. 
In man, spontaneous partial recovery has been noted many months after SCI, perhaps due to patterned 
neural activity [ 42]. DBS in the PAG/PVG could accentuate this restorative activity.  
Comparative advantages expected of DBS for treating SCI are as follows: 
 Permanently improve symptoms, not merely relieve them. 
 Every type of deficit recovers, not just, for example, limb movement or sensation 
 No untoward effects of prolonged stimulation, based on by [CONTACT_329346] 
 Dose can be immediately reduced or discontinued if adverse effects appear 
 Existing technology can be translated without modification to the treatment of SCI 
 Trophic DBS has a strong scientific support basis and theoretical basis in repair models 
 Can readily be combined in a non-interfering way with drug or cell implant therapy

SCI pain.  One review contains a meta-analysis of all published studies of DBS for pain that met adequate 
criteria for patient selection, pain evaluation and follow-up duration, which included cases of SCI pain. The 
other review focuses on DBS for SCI pain [ 32].  Details on the age and injury level, the method of pain 
assessment and basic surgical details, such as the stimulation site, are sometimes unclear or absent, 
especially in the earlier reports  
Technical neurosurgical terms in DBS. (1) “Internalization” is the technical neurosurgical term for 
completing the acute implantation surgery by [CONTACT_329347] a 
subcutaneously implanted electronic controller. (2) This controller is also referred to as a “generator”.  (3) 
“Leads” is another name [CONTACT_329396]. 
1. 12 SCI patients, 5 internalized [ 43]. Two leads were implanted, one in PVG and one in ST, 
specifically in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of thalamus (VPL). Cases were classified as 
Brown-Sequard (n=1), myelopathy (n=2), tetraplegia (n=1), post-dorsal root entry zone lesion 
(n=1), paraplegia (n=5), conus syndrome (n=1); syringomyelia (n=1); plexus avulsion (n=1). 
Patients were studied for 7 days before internalization of electronics and connector cables, which 
proceeded when a 50% or more pain reduction on a visual analog pain scale was achieved by a 
voltage that was 50% of the threshold for aversive responses. Reported aversive responses were 
paresthesias from ST stimulation and floating, and dizzy or warm feelings from the PVG.  Five 
patients met the criterion for internalization of electronic stimulators and connecting cables. Long-
term pain relief was seen in the following cases, all n=1; percentages shown are relief relative to 
pre-operative pain levels: myelopathy (25-50%), tetraplegia (0-25%), post-DREZ lesion (75-
100%), plexus avulsion (0-25%), paraplegia, (0-25%). Most patients received stimulation at both 
sites; the plexus avulsion case received only PVG stimulation.

extremities below T10, in all extremities below C5, in both lower extremities below T9, in the right 
lower limb (n=1). The first three cases were implanted bilaterally in the ventrocaudalis thalamic 
nucleus; the fourth received one lead in ventrocaudalis and one in the PAG/PVG. The first, third 
and fourth patients were internalized and experienced benefits lasting from 2 months to 5 years. 
3. 3 SCI patients, 1 internalized [ 45]. All sites were ST.  “One case of lower limb pain after excision 
of a neurofibroma of the lumbar region and two cases of gunshot wounds causing partial 
paraplegia.”  They “…experienced two early failures and one late failure because of tolerance 
development during the course of 2 years”. 
4. 8 SCI cases, 3 internalized [ 46]. There were 2 long-term successes, characterized as “almost 
complete pain relief” and “the patient's ability to resume a normal pain-free life”. All sites appear 
to have been in ST (VPL).   
5. SCI patients, 3 or 4 internalized [ 47]. The authors summarize their results as follows. “Fourteen 
electrodes, 7 sensory thalamic and 7 PAG/PVG, were implanted in [ADDRESS_406861] injury. Two of each class of electrodes were internalized (36%). No patient obtained 
long term pain relief with DBS”.  
6. 6 SCI patients, 5 internalized [ 48]. One patient had excellent relief and two had partial relief. 
Injuries are not described. Sites were ST (VPL) with or without PVG or PAG stimulation.  
This choice of sites reflected the view that ST should be targeted for neuropathic pain and PAG/PVG for 
nociceptive pain, since SCI pain is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a mixture of nociceptive and neuropathic pain [ 49]. However, 
the neuropathic pain of SCI is mechanistically distinct from other central neuropathic pains (e.g. post-stroke 
or thalamic pain syndrome) [ 50]. 
Insertion of electrodes in the PAG/PVG is reported to cause short-term analgesia [ 44]. Yet insertion could 
quite likely produce the opposite effect in some participants, temporarily blocking the stimulation-produced 
analgesia, which would have been excluded by [CONTACT_329348][INVESTIGATOR_83576], leading to 
underestimates of potential success rate.  
In summary, the total number of reported cases involving DBS surgery for SCI pain was 44. Only [ADDRESS_406862] combined with the PAG/PVG.  There are 3-4 cases 
of PAG/PVG stimulation without concomitant ST stimulation. Some of these were not typi[INVESTIGATOR_329303]. Thus existing data are too few to assess whether or not PAG/PVG stimulation is effective against 
SCI pain. Changes in other SCI symptoms were not described. A beneficial effect on autonomic dysreflexia 
is possible, since PAG/PVG stimulation inhibits the types of nociceptive pain that elicit it.

The Activa PC Deep Brain System as shown in Figure 1 below consists of the neurostimulator, leads, 
extensions, and clinician and patient programmers.   The Activa PC primary cell neurostimulator (model 
[ZIP_CODE]) is a multi-programmable device that can deliver electrical stimulation through one or two leads 
implanted in the brain. Stimulation is provided by [CONTACT_329349] a battery in an 
implantable neurostimulator (INS) to metal leads (electrodes) surgically implanted in the brain. The INS is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_329304]. Current is conducted to the electrodes via 
electrical conduits, including extensions (Models [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]) and leads (model 3387), which are 
tunneled subdermally through the neck, travel through the skull, and terminate in a neural structure 
appropriate to the neurological disease being treated. The Activa PC system is capable of providing 
stimulation to 2 leads, each with 4 electrode contacts. Stimulation parameters are adjusted to optimize 
therapy for the patient. They can be independently controlled and include the following: active electrode(s), 
electrode polarity, pulse width, amplitude, and frequency. The stimulation settings are stored in programs. 
A program is a specific combination of pulse width, rate, and amplitude settings acting on a specific 
electrode combination on a lead, or on a lead and the INS, in unipolar mode. Up to four programs can be 
combined into a group. Pulse width, amplitude, and electrode polarity are independently programmed for 
each program within a group.  Rate, rate limits and cycling for each program within a group must have the 
same values. Stimulation is delivered to a maximum of two implanted leads (one lead per hemisphere), 
with a maximum of 4 electrodes per lead. Rate is limited to 250 Hz, pulse width is limited to 450 μsec, 
amplitude is limited to 10.5 V (or 25.5 mA) and the charge density warning threshold is 30 µC/cm2/phase. 
Stimulation programs are controlled by [CONTACT_329350] N’Vision Clinician Programmer.  A patient 
programmer (model [ZIP_CODE]) will enable the patient to deactivate the device and can output an event log.

The risks of the device implant surgery (to the participants) in this study are identical and no more than 
those associated with current DBS surgery for Parkinson’s treatment. The risks include, but are not limited 
to, bleeding, transfusion, infection, sensory impairment, paralysis, speech arrest, stroke, seizure, 
intracerebral hemorrhage, coma, and/or death. The participants will be made aware of the risks in writing

To minimize surgical risks, exposure to general anesthetic, and additional stereotactic frame placement in 
one cranial procedure (as opposed to two separate) will be used to implant bilateral devices. This approach 
falls under the standard of care for DBS neurosurgery. 
There is potential throughout the study of adverse events occurring related to the implant itself.  These 
include but are not limited to, erosion of the device through the skin, migration or movement of the hardware 
in the brain, delayed infection of the device, battery failure, and/or mechanical failure of the device. These 
complications may necessitate further surgery to correct. However, it is important to note that the safety

      Page 28 of 58 11    STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 
11.1  Purpose/Objective 
We propose an investigation of the safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the alleviation of chronic 
neuropathic pain in patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI). The stimulation will be applied bilaterally or 
unilaterally in the midbrain periaqueductal-periventricular gray region (PAG/PVG). Indications of efficacy 
will also be examined. Patients will receive bilateral implants in the case of complete SCI (ASIA-A).  
Patients with an incomplete SCI who can localize pain to one side of the body will receive unilateral 
stimulation of the PAG contralateral to the sites of pain. 
Although PAG/PVG stimulation has been used previously in SCI pain patients, the small numbers of 
patients studied and the lack of detail on their testing and injury status makes a phase I trial appropriate. 
Effective treatment of pain could also bring benefits to patients with autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which 
can be provoked by [CONTACT_329353]. Autonomic 
functioning will therefore be studied as a secondary outcome. Preclinical evidence from rats suggests that 
prolonged PAG stimulation may lead to enduring improvements in all deficits (sensory, motor, and 
autonomic). The proposed study will therefore examine if such improvements occur when PAG/PVG 
stimulation is applied over many weeks.  
Aim 1 is to determine whether DBS in the PAG/PVG at analgesic intensities produces any systemic or 
neurological adverse effects in patients with longstanding SCI (>1 year), either immediately or as a result 
of prolonged application for up 40 weeks.  
Aim 2 is to determine whether acute application of DBS in the PAG/PVG influences the severity of 
spontaneous ongoing pain caused by [CONTACT_329354].  
Aim 3 is to determine whether DBS in the PAG/PVG affects stimulus-evoked or persistent hypertension (a 
major sign of autonomic dysreflexia) in chronic SCI patients.  
Aim 4 is to determine whether prolonged PAG/PVG stimulation (for 10 months) leads to cumulative 
changes in chronic pain severity, motor or autonomic symptoms in chronic SCI patients. 
11.2  Core (null) Hypothesis:  
The null hypothesis is that, in humans, deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied bilaterally or unilaterally in 
the midbrain periaqueductal-periventricular gray region (PAG/PVG) will not alleviate chronic neuropathic 
pain in patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI). 
11.3  Primary Objectives: 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied bilaterally or unilaterally in the

in patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI). 
11.4  Secondary Objectives: 
To assess the clinical effects of DBS on autonomic functioning when PAG/PVG stimulation is applied over 
many weeks (44 weeks); to determine with Activa PC+S whether local field portentials in the PAG/PVG 
can be used to predict the efficacy of DBS in this region.

12.1  Type of Study 
Phase 1, open label study. 
12.2  Expected Number of Participants 
Twelve (12) participants with SCI for >1 year and show chronic persistent pain that has not fully responded 
to drug treatment. 
12.3  Treatment Groups 
One (1) Treatment group. All participants will receive the same treatment (long-term DBS in PAG/PVG) 
and undergo the same procedural protocol.  Ethical considerations forbid a control group that receives 
implant surgery without stimulation. Hence participants must serve as their own controls. 
After internalization of the pulse generator (electronic stimulator) and subcutaneous tunneling of 
connecting cables to the electrode and 12-48 hours for recovery from this internalization procedure , 
stim
ulation will be applied to the patient. The patient will be asked to report their ongoing pain level, on a 
0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) with the stimulation turned off and, for each electrode contact, in small 
voltage steps up to the threshold for any aversive effects (if not seen in the first step). Floating, dizzy or 
warm feelings can be expected, based on literature reports. If there is no ongoing pain, cutaneous brushing 
to cause allodynia below the injury, at sensitive sites determined in the pre-surgical testing sessions, will 
be used. Blood pressure will also be measured by [CONTACT_329355]. This will be 
repeated on week 12 The optimal level will be 67% of threshold for aversive or other unwanted effects (e.g. 
motor) or device maximum (10 V) if such effects are not observed. We expect the optimal voltage to be 4-
10V. A frequency range of 10-[ADDRESS_406867]’s responses. The subject returns home with the optimal 
stimulation settings after each programming session. 
Subjects will receive monthly adjustment of stimulation levels to optimize analgesia on the NRS . They will 
be given the option of remaining in the study if any level becomes unpleasant in later months. 
The subject will be given up to [ADDRESS_406868] is not determined, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a pain diary (score 0-
10) at intervals of [ADDRESS_406869] does not tolerate 
continuous stimulation for many hours, cycling at shorter intervals (e.g., one-hour on and off periods) will 
be tested.  
Although all subjects receive the same DBS treatment, a subset will receive the PC+S device for additional 
sensing of brain signals. After regulatory permissions have been obtained, the next subject to reach surgical 
consent (stage 3 consent) will receive this devi ce. Subsequent enrollees will also receive the Activa PC+S 
DBS system.

Supplement S007 Clinical Protocol 
      Page 30 of 58 12.5  Description of the Measures Taken to Minimize/Avoid Bias 
As this is an open label safety study without a control group, no specific measures will be taken (e.g., 
randomization, blinding, etc.) to minimize /avoid bias.   Subjects will not be randomized, and all will receive 
the same pattern. The subject and the primary evaluator will not be blinded to the stimulation level. Long-
term changes over the course of the treatment will be analyzed by [CONTACT_5586]-series analysis of the adjusted 
stimulation levels. Placebo effects from surgery, as well as the safety and stability of the DBS implant, will 
be analyzed when the stimulator is inactivated during programming adjustment sessions by [CONTACT_431]. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_406870] Participation  
 Participants will be monitored throughout a one year evaluation period for occurrence of AEs (acute, 
delayed, and/or cumulative), as well as for changes in clinical status, neurological status. 
 Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at week [ADDRESS_406871] and 
investigators will be given the opportunity for open comments and questions concerning elements of 
the study.  
 After the initial 52-week study period subjects can choose to remain in the study for an extended period 
lasting approximately [ADDRESS_406872] opted to receive 
continuing brain stimulation. We label weeks in terms of original enrollment. Thus the surgery occurs in 
weeks 7 and 8 and the original study finishes in week 52, with the extension lasting from week 53 to week 
156. 
Aims: 
1. To evaluate any changes in pain relief in the 2nd and 3rd year of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in 
the midbrain periaqueductal/periventricular gray (PAG/PVG). 
2. To assess needs for changes in stimulation parameters (contact [CONTACT_145126], voltage, frequency, 
pulse width) to continue optimal relief. 
3. To determine changes in injury status revealed by [CONTACT_329356].  
4. To uncover later-occurring adverse effects. 
 
Enrollment. Subjects will preferably continue without a gap at the end of the original 52 week study. 
However, they may be enrolled at any time during the extension to accommodate the time needed to obtain 
regulatory approval for the extension or subjects who wish to take a break. An additional informed consent 
form will be used for enrollment.  
Procedures. Subjects will receive continuous DBS in the PAG/PVG from the previously implanted system. 
They will return every [ADDRESS_406873] the visits with a blinded choice of settings (2 to 4, labeled A, B, C D), which 
they can explore at home. Preliminary findings suggest that pain changes over several days when settings 
are changed, and that slow recursive testing is the best way to find the optimum. Subjects may request visits 
IDE G120202   Attachment [ADDRESS_406874] a PC+S 
generator device implanted, which allows recording from the stimulating leads. Subjects with this device 
will also undergo brief recording sessions during visits, following the protocol of the first year.  
Tests and questionnaires. The study extension will use only questionnaires and study forms from the 
original study. It will omit autonomic system testing and quantitative sensory testing. On-site assessment 
will be done in clinical exam rooms and offices of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis of the University of 
Miami Miller School of Medicine, including ASIA assessment. If the stimulator settings are producing 
consistent adequate pain relief, visits may be omitted at the subject’s discretion, except for weeks [ADDRESS_406875] Injury pain basic data set (ISCI)

In addition, subjects will be asked to keep a pain diary with a morning and evening pain score rated from 0 
(no pain) to 10 (worst ever pain). The pain diary will be retrieved at the visits or by [CONTACT_756] .  
At weeks 104 and 156, we will determine the ASIA score (American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_329305], sensory and motor). On week 156, an open ended qualitative exit interview will be conducted 
with audiovisual recording, including questions on the overall experience, effects on daily life, etc.  
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded immediately after telephone contact [CONTACT_329357] (subject-reported 
AEs) and during visits to the study site (clinician-reported AEs).

Participants, Parts of Trial, and Entire Trial.  
A. Termination by [CONTACT_329358]. No further procedures will be performed or information will be collected from participants 
that withdraw consent. Previously collected data and samples will be used for the study analysis.  
B. Termination by [CONTACT_214990]: 
 Failure to enroll patients. 
 Protocol violations. 
 Inaccurate or incomplete data. 
 Unsafe or unethical practices. 
 Questionable safety of the study device. 
 Administrative decision. 
C. Termination by [CONTACT_079]: 
[INVESTIGATOR_329306] a subject from the study at any time for any of the following 
reasons (Note:  If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_329307] a subject prematurely, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_329308]/IEC and 
the Sponsor with a written statement describing why the study subject was removed prematurely).   
 Onset of confounding neurological problems such as severe dysesthesia, severe neuropathic pain, 
or changing neurological level.  
 Serious adverse event: discontinuation due to a serious adverse event. 
 Lost to follow-up: the subject fails to return to the study site for scheduled visits and does not 
respond to attempts to contact. 
 Withdrew consent: the subject decides to stop his participation for any other reason than an adverse 
event, or is unable to complete the study as described in the study protocol. 
 Administrative: the Sponsor decides to terminate an individual subject or decides to discontinue 
the study due to general safety concerns. 
 Protocol violation: anything that is a direct and significant violation of the clinical study protocol.  
D. Partial Termination  
If the treatment appears at any point to be clearly successful in any patient, the choice of constant 
stimulation at the best amplitude will be offered. Regardless of whether the stimulation is stopped 
permanently or left at a constant level, the patient will be followed according to the study plan for as 
long as they remain willing. The patient may also elect to receive no further stimulation but to stay in 
the full study to assess pain and other variables.  
E. Futility and Enrichment: 
Gradual benefits may be seen from prolonged treatment. Therefore the study will not be stopped early 
in the absence of interim benefits, nor will the stimulation intensity be increased.

14.2  Method of Assigning Participants to Treatment Groups: 
Not applicable. This study will employ an open label , non-randomized, and non-placebo controlled design. 
There will be only one treatment group. 
14.3  Participant Procedures and Assessments 
14.3.1 Baseli ne Assessments 
Participants who remain eligible after all the screening procedures are complete will undergo the following 
baseline assessments at 2- week, prior to surgical procedures. 
 Functional Pain Assessments  
o ISCI basic pain dataset and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) 
o West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory for persons with SCI (MPI-SCI)

 Autonomic Assessment:  
o Autonomic Standards Assessment (BP, HR, sympathetic skin response) 
o Tilt table exam response. 
14.3.2 Surgi cal Procedures and Assessments.  
The surgical procedure for implantation of a PAG/PVG deep brain stimulator is described here.  The 
procedure technique is no different than FDA approved deep brain stimulator procedures for movement 
disorder.  All patients undergo MRI imaging of the brain prior to surgery. Particular imaging sequences 
consist of thin cut (1-2mm) T1 and T2 weighted images.  On the morning of surgery, in the pre-anesthesia 
holding area, a Cosbid, Robert, Wells (CRW) frame is rigidly affixed to the skull with four point fixation.  
This is done with local anesthetic injections consisting of .5% Marcaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:200,000, a total 
of 20-30cc is usually used.   
Once the frame is in place, the patient will undergo a CT scan of the brain without contrast agent.  This CT 
scan has the localizer rods in place, which create a stereotactic field for precise localization of target.  The 
imaging studies including the CT scan and the prior obtained MRI are uploaded into a Medtronic planning 
station which allows for manipulation of the images and targeting of the periaqueductal gray.  The computer 
IDE G120202   Attachment [ADDRESS_406886] scan 
by [CONTACT_329365].  
The patient is then placed on the operating room table in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_329318] 45o.  The patients head is fixed in this position with the use of the frame.  The entire head is 
then shaved and the right frontal area of the scalp approximately 11cm back from the nasion and 3.5cm off 
the midline on the right side is injected with approximately 20cc of 0.5% Marcaine with 1:200,000 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. The CRW arc with the X,Y, and Z coordinate for the target is then applied to the CRW frame.  
A small curvilinear incision is then made and a 14mm burr hole is made using a Midas Rex drill.  A burr 
hole cap is applied to the circumference of the burr hole.  The dura is then opened using electrocautery 
exposing the underlying cortical surface.  An 11-blade scalpel is then used to score the pia.  At this point, 
a Ben-Gunn Stage is applied to the CRW arc and a cannula is inserted down the center channel of the Ben-
Gunn through the burr hole, traversing the right frontal lobe to end at a depth of 25mm above the desired 
target.   
With the use of neurophysiologic monitoring the target is optimized for lead placement.  Neurophysiologic 
monitoring for this target, the periaqueductal grey, is not well defined.  Therefore, targeting will be 
primarily based on image guidance.  The lead (model # 3387) itself is then inserted to a pre-defined depth 
of 237mm.  This will place the tip at the chosen target.   
Test stimulation will be performed to determine the adequacy of targeting.  The patient will report feelings 
evoked by [CONTACT_329366] (see 14.7). 
After confirmation of target accuracy the lead is secured in place.  A lead protector is placed over the distal 
end of the lead which is tunneled into a subgaleal pocket over the right parietal boss. The frontal scalp 
incision is closed with a combination of 2-[ADDRESS_406887] scan may be performed after the lead implantation procedure to confirm 
target and ensure no trauma has occurred.  
General anesthesia is induced, and the patient is endotracheally intubated.  The operating room table is 
turned 90o and the patients head turned 70o to the left, placed on a donut head holder with a roll under the 
shoulder blades to put the neck in slight extension.  
The surgical sites are then prepped and draped sterilely.  Local anesthetic is injected using 0.5% Marcaine 
with 1:200,[ADDRESS_406888] incision is re-approximated using 3-0 vicryl stitch in an interrupted, inverted subcuticular 
manner.  Steri-strips are applied to the skin.  The parietal boss incision is re-approximated by [CONTACT_2329] 2-0 
vicryl for the galea and staples for the skin.  
14.3.3 Targe ting & Lead Placement 
Targeting is accomplished by [CONTACT_329367] 3T MRI images with thin cut CT scan images and 
the use of computerized targeting software. Images are uploaded into the targeting software.  The computer 
then fuses both MRI and CT scans together.  The operator of the computer is then able to identify certain 
IDE G120202   Attachment 17 .2 
Supplement S007 Clinical Protocol 
      Page 40 of 58 landmarks including the anterior commissure (AC) and posterior commissure (PC).  The intercommisural 
length is then calculated.  The actual target is then identified by [CONTACT_329368].  In the 
case of the periaqueductal grey, the X coordinate is 10mm posterior to the mid-commisural point, the Y 
coordinate is 2-3mm lateral to the wall of the IIIrd ventricle, and the Z coordinate is in the plane of the 
intercommisural line.  T2 weighted images can then be used to further refine the target based on direct 
visualization of the periaqueductal grey.   
Once the final target is identified, the computer yields an X,Y,Z coordinate for the stereotactic field.  This 
is set on the CRW arc and used to deliver the lead. 
14.3.[ADDRESS_406889] stimulation will begin with an external neurostimulator (model # [ZIP_CODE]).  
Macrostimulation will be performed by a Neurologist who specializes in neurophysiologic monitoring for 
deep brain stimulation.  He has been involved in well over 700 similar procedures.  The macrostimulation 
procedure involves an algorithm that tests all combinations of contacts in a bipolar fashion.  Both pulse-
width and frequency will be set at fixed values and amplitude will be gradually increased in steps while 
recording clinical effects.  The goal will be to determine optimal settings for therapeutic effects as well as 
suboptimal settings that induce side effects.  It should be noted that all effects from stimulation are fully 
reversible by [CONTACT_329369].  Upon successful 
intraoperative macrostimulation, the implantable neurostimulator (model [ZIP_CODE]) will be connected. 
Therapeutic effect can be elicited by [CONTACT_329370] a warm feeling in various areas of the body.  N o 
such feeling, however, does not preclude optimal targeting.  Chronic stimulation may be needed to induce 
a beneficial effect.  
Likewise, changes in vital signs will also be assessed as these changes are indicative of autonomic effects.  
Examples would be change in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, etc.   
Neurologic changes would also be assessed as the periaqueductal grey is close to the superior colliculus 
and thus various eye findings might be induced. 
If the subject reports effects of DBS on sleep, the stimulation will be cycled in appropriate 12-hour on and 
off periods in a [ADDRESS_406890] does not tolerate 
continuous stimulation for many hours, cycling at faster on and off periods will be tested. 
In subjects with an implanted PC+S device, the visits at weeks 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52 will include 
recording of local field potentials. Recording will be done from all contacts during DBS at optimal setting 
for pain relief, over a period of one minute. 
14.3.5 Moni toring Participant for Comfort 
All participants will be arousable during surgery and thus able to vocalize any discomfort.  Our institution 
has a specially trained anesthesia team adept at deep brain stimulation surgery and its particular nuances as 
it pertains to awake procedures.  Patients will all be on a Precedex drip for sedation with intermittent dosing 
of remifentanyl for comfort. 
The second surgery for generator internalization involves general anesthesia, skin incision and 
subcutaneous manipulation. Due to these factors (superficial post-operative pain, incomplete recovery from 
anesthesia), the subject may not be in a satisfactory state to be discharged on the surgery day, especially if 
scheduling factors cause a late surgery.  Physician judgement will be used to decide whether an additional 
1-[ADDRESS_406891] common reason for removal is infection.  At our institution, deep brain stimulation carries a 1.5% 
risk of infection necessitating removal.  The majority of the time, the implantable neurostimulator and 
extension cables need to be removed with preservation of the intracranial lead.  This is a result of the fact 
that most infections start at the neurostimulator implant site.   
Alternative reasons for removal of the system would be patient request in the event that the device does not 
produce its intended results.  However, in this instance, it is rare for patients to request removal as it requires 
additional surgery and there is no significant risk to keepi[INVESTIGATOR_106390].  Devices may also malfunction or 
break necessitating removal or revision surgery to fix.   
Generators have a lifespan which ends at the time of battery failure. On average generator batteries fail after 
3-5 years depending on stimulation parameters. Battery longevity depends also on sensing features. Thus it 
is expected that the battery of the Activa PC+S [ADDRESS_406892] less than that of the Activa 
PC [ZIP_CODE] (which does not allow for sensing). When considering the stimulation parameters currently being 
used in the study, the Medtronic reference manual for battery longevity of the Activa PC+S 
neurostimulation system for DBS estimates the longevity at roughly over 4.5 years. This number only 
represents an estimate, considering battery longevity depends on several factors: programmed parameters, 
system impedance, hours per day of stimulation, degree of patient control over programmable stimulation 
parameters, and the use of sensing features (in the case of the Activa PC+S system). This figure is based on 
stimulation frequencies >100 Hz as used in  movement disorders; it is expected that pain treatment will use 
lower frequencies (<25 Hz) which will give at least 1-2 years more lifetime according to calculations based 
on manufacturer’s confidential data (M949908A001, System eligibility and battery longevity manual for 
Activa PC+S). In the event that battery replacement would be needed, routine, same day, surgery is 
performed to remove and replace the generator.   
14.[ADDRESS_406893] Implantation Procedures & Follow- up 
Procedures performed to evaluate the safety of the investigational procedures and to evaluate subject 
outcome for this study include: 
A. Beginning one week after surgery, participants will undergo follow-up assessments post-implantation: 
i. Pain assessments every 2 weeks (ISCI basic pain data set, NPSI,), starting on week 10, will 
assess for development of, or changes in neuropathic pain; more comprehensive pain testing 
(MPI [CONTACT_173221]/allodynia) will take place on comprehensive testing visit 
weeks (20-week, 32-week, and 52-week). 
ii. Autonomic Standards Assessment : on on-site visit weeks (BP, HR, sympathetic skin response) 
and on week 20, week 32, and week 52 (Tilt table response exam). Patient Self-assessment of 
Autonomic Responses occurs weekly starting on week 3, except on on-site visit weeks.  
iii. QoL assessments: on on-site visit weeks, starting on week 12 (Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI-1a )) and weekly, starting on week 9 (Guy/Farrar Patient Global Impression of Change 
(PGIC));
 
iv. ASIA motor and sensory assessments:  on weeks 20, 32 and 52 to assess any improvement or 
deterioration in neurological function; 
v. a qualitative exit interview with audio recording at [ADDRESS_406894] to recovery of neurological 
functioning or the development of adverse effects. 
14.6  Medication(s)/Treatment(s) Permitted (Concomitant Medications) and not Permitted 
Before and/or During the Trial:  
A. Permitted Treatment 
All medication taken by [CONTACT_329371].  All medications required 
to treat the participant should be administered as recommended.  The following data will be recorded 
for all included participants up to the end of the study period:  name [CONTACT_329397], 
start and end dates, hours of administration, and indication.  Fluid and blood replacement will be 
measured and documented on a daily basis.  Additionally, any therapeutic or surgical procedure 
performed during the study period should be recorded, including the date, description of the 
procedure, and clinical findings 
B. Prohibited Treatment 
Investigational drugs and any other intervention (not part of the guidelines for management of SC I) 
known to have a potential impact on outcome are prohibited. 
14.7  Procedures for Monitoring Participant  Compliance 
(Please Refer to Section 20 QUALITY CONTROL and QUALITY ASSURANCE) 
15    SAFETY 
Particip
ants will be continuously monitored throughout a one (1) year evaluation period.  Assessments will 
be performed as outlined in Table 1 and Table 2 in section 13.6. Assessments will also include monitoring 
of occurrence of AEs (acute, delayed, and/or cumulative), as well for changes in clinical status, neurological 
status and/or functional status.  Safety will be determined as follows: 
a) Adverse events or other safety concerns will be ascribed to one of two categories: (1) general known 
problems with all types of DBS (e.g. infection) or with untreated SCI (e.g., bladder control failure); 
(2) problems caused by [CONTACT_329372]/PVG site in particular (e.g., hypotension) or to a specific response 
of SCI symptoms to DBS (e.g., more pain). The first category will not lead to ejection of the 
method. The second category can be evaluated more by [CONTACT_329373] 4-week  periods of (8-weeks after week 24) adjustment of stimulation 
amplitudes. Second-category events will be carefully assessed and will lead to discontinuation of 
the study treatment if they cannot be ascribed to special circumstances in a given patient. 
b) Comprehensive pain, motor and autonomic assessment will occur on screening and enrollment 
(baseline) and then on on-site visit weeks (weeks 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52).  
c) The correct functioning of the DBS apparatus will be monitored every [ADDRESS_406895] visit (week 52). 
d) Pain Assessments using the ISCIPDS:B and neuropathic rating scale will evaluate development of 
neuropathic pain syndromes. 
The secondary hypothesis which concerns autonomic assessment will also take place during routine 
patient visits. Heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, body temperature and breathing will be classified as 
normal, abnormal, unknown, or unable to access. Within the abnormal category, sub-categories will be 
IDE G120202   Attachment 17 .2 
Supplement S007 Clinical Protocol 
      Page 43 of 58 specified: for heart rate, bradycardia, tachycardia or other dysrhythmias; for blood pressure, systolic blood 
pressure under 90 mm Hg, orthostatic hypotension, autonomic dysreflexia; for sweating, hyperhydrosis 
above lesion, hyperhydrosis below lesion, hyperhydrosis below lesion; for body temperature, 
hyperthermia, hypothermia; for breathing, requiring full ventilatory support, requiring partial ventilatory 
support, impaired not requiring ventilatory support. Lower urinary tract, bowel and sexual function will 
be scored on the following: awareness of need to empty bladder and ability to prevent urine leakage; 
sensation of need for bowel movement, ability to prevent stool leakage, voluntary anal sphincter 
contraction; genital arousal (psychogenic and reflex), orgasm, ejaculation (male), and sensation of menses 
(female). 
Comprehensive testing sessions will analyze vagal and sympathetic influences on the cardiovascular 
system, measuring blood pressure and heart rate variability (power spectrum analysis) during sit-up or 
tilt-table challenge. However, if a subject is not able to tolerate the tilt table response exam to completion, 
he/she will not be required to fulfill this test at subsequent visits. The neurologist will decide whether it is 
recommended for subjects to undergo this assessment thereafter. Additionally, the test will not be 
required for subjects not expected to show autonomic dysreflexia because of their lower level of injury, as 
determined by [CONTACT_22971].  
Assessment of motor and non-pain somatosensory function will be done during visits every 4 weeks . 
Clinical sensory testing will include Light Touch and Pin Prick tests defined in the ASIA standards [1]. The 
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-1a ) will also be used, to assess emotional function in neuropathic pain 
[4]. A score of [ADDRESS_406896]-EFFICACY 
Th
e trend towards efficacy of the intervention will be assessed from the following parameters: 
a. AIS upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. 
b. Pain Assessments: ISCI basic pain dataset, quantitative sensory testing and Self-report version of 
ISCI basic pain dataset. 
c. Autonomic Assessments: BP, HR, tilt table response, sympathetic skin responses,  
d. Quality of Life: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-1a ), Guy/Farrar Patient Global Impression of 
Change (PGIC). 
17    STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
17.1  Safety Analyses: 
The analyses for safety will be mainly descriptive, focusing on trends for within-subject differences and 
changes in reported pain intensity during routine patient visits for the duration of the study. The expected 
outcome is stable, long-lasting change in the Pain Assessment Scale score from baseline to [ADDRESS_406897] completed the 
study.

Safety will not primarily be evaluated statistically. 
In addition to the continual monitoring of adverse events, safety analyses will use generalized linear 
models. The main dependent variable of interest is the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score for pain. 
Additionally there will be a fairly large number of dependent variables derived from assessments of other 
symptoms. Distributions will be modeled as binomial (yes=1 or no=0) or multinomial (e.g., score =1, 2, 
or 0) or normal (e.g., heart rate peak power after tilt, quantitative sensory thresholds). Less frequently, a 
Poisson distribution will be appropriate (e.g., number of times the patient reports autonomic dysreflexia in 
a given period). An appropriate link function will be chosen for each assumed distribution. Covariates to 
be considered are injury level, injury completeness and electrode configuration. The hypotheses to be 
tested for any variable (using the above factor coding) is that B<>A, C<>B, D<>B and D<>C. Marginal 
means can be used for this (except in multinomial examples, when main effects must suffice).  Some 
participants may lack data from one condition (if they immediately opted for continuous high-level 
stimulation after the initial untreated period). If the continuous treatment is stopped soon after it starts, 
only the placebo effect (A<>B) will be available. Representative independent variables from each type of 
symptom will be further explored by [CONTACT_161993], which can confirm that one or more treatment 
condition represents a distinct state in the multivariate outcome space. 
17.2    Efficacy Analyses:  
To test the core hypothesis and secondary outcome measures,  the analysis (descriptive) for efficacy trends 
will be conducted on the baseline through  52 weeks of data collection for all twelve (12)  participants 
enrolled.  
The one-minute recordings of local fields potentials from the bilateral or unilateral contacts PAG/PVG by 
[CONTACT_289278]+S device will be analyzed in the time domain (autocorrelations and inter-lead cross-correlations)  
and the frequency domain (power in alpha, beta, gamma and delta EEG bands). Peaks in spectra or in 
auto- or cross-correlations  will be examined for correlations with pain level (analgesia obtained) for each 
contact [CONTACT_329374].  The potential ability shown by [CONTACT_329375] (with pain from SCI or other causes) will be evaluated. That is, their 
IDE G120202   Attachment [ADDRESS_406898] populations with pain of adequate statistical power. 
17.3    Power Analyses: 
This study is to be conducted for a period of three (3) years, starting from when the first subject is enrolled .  
As this is an open label safety study without a control group, no statistical analyses (other than descriptive) 
are proposed.  
While a formal power analysis is not warranted, analysis of statistical power could be based on ASIA motor 
scores, whose variability has been most thoroughly detailed in the literature. This score ranges between 0 
and 100. Data from a large-scale drug study on SCI showed that a 10-point change will reach a significance 
level of 0.05 if the number of patients with chronic cervical or thoracic injuries classified as ASIA A or B 
is ≈8 [ 51]. Recovery of sensory scores is typi[INVESTIGATOR_205261] 10%. Thus, the population size (n=12) should 
therefore have sufficient power for many planned statistical tests, especially since participants will serve as 
their own controls.

24.1  APPENDIX 1 -- ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING 
1. Definitio
ns 
1.1. An Adverse Event (AE)  [a.k.a. "adverse experience"] is any untoward, undesired, unplanned 
clinical event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiological observations 
IDE G120202   Attachment 17 .2 
Supplement S007 Clinical Protocol 
      Page 51 of 58 occurring in a human being participating in a clinical study with a Sponsor study device, regardless 
of causal relationship.  This includes the following: 
 Any clinically significant worsening of a preexisting condition. 
 Any recurrence of a preexisting condition. 
 An AE occurring from excessive output of a Sponsor study device whether accidental 
or intentional (i.e., an amplitude higher than that prescribed by a clinical 
neurophysiologist). 
 An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a Sponsor study 
device. 
Note:  A medical procedure is not an AE, but the reason for a procedure may be an AE. 
1.2. A Preexisting Condition  is a clinical condition (including a condition being treated) that is 
diagnosed before the patient signs the informed consent form and that is documented as part of the 
patient’s medical history.  
The questions concerning whether the condition existed before the start of the active phase of the 
study and whether it has increased in severity and/or frequency are used to determine whether an 
event is a treatment-emergent AE (TEAE).  An AE is considered to be treatment emergent if: 
  it was not present when the active phase of the study began and is not a chronic 
condition that is part of the patient’s medical history, or  
 it was present at the start of the active phase of the study or as part of the patient’s 
medical history, but the severity or frequency increased during the active phase.  The 
active phase of the study begins at the time of the first use of the study device. 
1.3. A Serious Adverse Event (S AE) is any AE occurring at any dose (voltage output) that results in 
one (1) or more of the following outcomes:  
 Death. 
 Life threatening situation (see below). 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see below). 
 Persistent or significant disability or incapacity (see below). 
 Congeni
tal anomaly or birth defect. 
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an AE or 
SAE, the information is treated as an AE or SAE. 
1.4. A Life Threatening Adverse Event  is any AE that places the patient at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred.  A life-threatening event does not include an event that might have 
caused death had it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of 
death as it actually occurred.    
1.5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329320].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329321] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a criterion for considering an AE to be serious.  In the absence 
of an AE, the participating Investigator should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329322] a CRF.  This is the case in the following situations:  
IDE G120202   Attachment 17 .2 
Supplement S007 Clinical Protocol 
      Page 52 of 58  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_760].   
 Day or night survey visits for biopsy or surgery required by [CONTACT_760]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142055] a routine procedure 
followed by [CONTACT_5243] (e.g., stent removal after surgery). 
 In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a preexisting 
condition that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE (e.g., elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13001] a total knee replacement due to a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that 
has not worsened during the study).  
1.6. Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
2. Timing for Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
2.1. Any SAE, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the Sponsor's Medical Monitor 
(or a designated affiliate) immediately (i.e., within 24 hrs).  A completed Serious Adverse Event 
Form must be faxed to the number indicated at the front of the clinical protocol no later than [ADDRESS_406913] be reported to a Sponsor Medical Monitor (or an 
affiliate or designee) within [ADDRESS_406914] be reported to a Sponsor Medical Monitor (or an affiliate or designee) 
immediately (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_13172] a Medical Monitor listed in the front of this protocol.  
2.4. For all other inquiries and information about this study, contact [CONTACT_329387].  
3. Reportable Events/Information 
3.1. An AE or SAE that occurs between the time that the patient signs the informed consent form 
through thirty (30) days from the patient’s last dose (voltage output), regardless of study device or 
protocol relationship should be reported.  This includes events that emerge during the screening 
and pre-treatment run-in periods.   
 All AEs and SAEs will be recorded on source documents and recorded on CRFs.   
 All AEs and SAEs that occur after the screening period will be recorded on the CRFs.   
 The Sponsor Medical Monitor must instruct the investigator to follow up as is medically 
necessary on all AEs, SAEs, and other reportable events until the event has subsided or 
values have returned to baseline, or in case of permanent impairment, until the condition 
stabilizes.   
3.2. For SAEs:  The investigator will provide all documentation pertaining to the event (e.g., additional 
laboratory tests, consultation reports, discharge summaries, postmortem reports, etc.) to the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor in a timely manner.  Reports relative to the patient’s subsequent course 
must be submitted to the Sponsor until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, 
until the condition stabilizes.  
IDE G120202   Attachment [ADDRESS_406915](s) he or she thinks 
is necessary to manage the patient properly. 
5. Recording and Reporting 
5.1. At each required study visit, all AEs that have occurred since the previous visit must be 
documented and recorded in the Adverse Event Record of the patient’s CRF.  The information 
recorded should be based on the signs or symptoms detected during the physical examination and 
clinical evaluation of the patient.  In addition to the information obtained from those sources, the 
patient should be asked the following nonspecific question:  "How have you been feeling since 
your last visit?"  Signs and symptoms should be recorded using standard medical terminology. 
5.2. The following AE information must be included (when applicable):   
 the specific condition or event and direction of change;  
 whether the condition was preexisting (i.e., an acute condition present at the start of the 
study or history of a chronic condition) and, if so, whether it has worsened (e.g., in severity 
and/or frequency);  
 the dates and times of occurrence; severity; causal relationship to study device; action 
taken; and outcome.   
5.3. The causal relation between an AE and the study device will be determined by [CONTACT_329388]: 
 Definitely related:  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_329389]. 
 Probably related :  Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_329390]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 Possibly related :  Event may be explained by [CONTACT_329391]’s 
clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 Probably not related :  Event is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or 
other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], rather than the study device. 
 Definitely not related :  Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other 
agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
5.4. When assessing the relationship between use of a study device and an AE, the following should 
be considered: 
 Temporal relationship between use of the study device and the AE. 
 Biological plausibility of relationship. 
 Patient’s underlying clinical state or concomitant agents and/or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
5.5. SAEs that are not study device related may nevertheless be considered by [CONTACT_329392] (or designee) to be related to the conduct of the clinical study, 
i.e., to a patient's participation in the study.  For example, a protocol-related SAE may be related 
to a procedure required by [CONTACT_760]. 
5.6. The following definitions should be used when determining the severity of an AE.  Please note 
that there are some cases in which removal of study device may be appropriate. 
 Mild (grade 1):   The AE is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with routine 
activity
.  The AE does not require discontinuing use or reducing the voltage output of the 
IDE G120202   Attachment 17 .2 
Supplement S007 Clinical Protocol 
      Page 54 of 58 study device. 
 Moderate (grade 2):   The AE interferes with routine activity but responds to symptomatic 
th
erapy or rest.  The AE may require reducing the voltage output but not discontinuing use 
of the study device. 
 Severe (grade 3):   The AE significantly limits the patient’s ability to perform routine 
activiti
es despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795].  In addition, the AE leads to discontinuing use or 
reducing the voltage output of the study device. 
 Life Threatening (grade 4):  The AE requires discontinuing use of the study device.  The 
patient is at immediate risk of death.

HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Study Title The Diabetes Homeless Medication Support (D-Homes) Program – Part Three Funder NIH-NIDDK Clinical Phase N/A Study Rationale More than eight million Americans each year experience unstable housing and/or homelessness; this includes 44% of all adults seen at community health centers. The chronically homeless have a 5- to 10-fold increased risk of premature death and high health care costs (driven by [CONTACT_68923][INVESTIGATOR_6042]). Diabetes prevalence is approximately the same among the homeless versus general population (8%), but people with type [ADDRESS_75372] worse glycemic control and are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68890] a decade earlier and with more frequency than their housed peers. Managing diabetes while homeless presents a unique set of barriers including food insecurity, low social support, lack of safe medication storage/refrigeration. Almost half of people who are homeless have comorbid mental illness and/or substance use.  Prescription medications are a cornerstone in the management of type 2 diabetes and avoidance of complications. Diabetes medication adherence is low in housed populations, and limited evidence suggests it is as low or lower among DH; adherence is highly correlated with all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47144].  We will consider the study feasible if we enroll 75% of those screened who meet inclusion criteria, and 75% of enrolled participants complete at least one follow-up. We will consider 50% session attendance as indicative of feasibility. We will consider the intervention acceptable if 70% of participants are satisfied and would recommend it to others.  The goal of the current study is to conduct a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_68891] D-HOMES program. D-HOMES is a coaching-based collaborative care intervention tailored to DH using behavioral activation, motivational interviewing and psychosocial support to improve medication adherence. We will compare this to brief diabetes education and referral to meet medical and psychosocial needs. Our team’s central hypothesis is that medication adherence, glycemic control, health care use/cost will improve with D-HOMES more than in our comparison. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_68892]-powered to assess efficacy and focuses on recruitment, retention, blinding, and randomization procedures. Study Objective(s) Primary

Follow-up 1: 12-16-week follow-up assessments and A1c       Follow-up 2: 24-30-week follow-up assessments and A1c Efficacy Evaluations • Satisfaction with trial, recruitment, retention rates • Hemoglobin A1c measured by [CONTACT_2929]-of-care fingerstick or venipuncture  • Self-reported medication adherence • Self-reported psychological wellness • Self-reported diabetes self-management, distress  • Height, weight, blood pressure Safety Evaluations Subject safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_68926]. We will also follow safety protocols in case we identify dangerous blood pressure values during assessment visits Statistical And Analytic Plan We hypothesize a satisfactory, feasible, acceptable intervention with adequate recruitment and retention rates. We may see early indicators of improvement in efficacy measures of adherence, glycemic control, and wellness among intervention participants compared to comparison.  We will consider the study feasible if we screen 50% of those referred, enroll 75% of those screened who meet inclusion criteria, and 75% of participants complete follow-up. We will consider 70% session attendance as indicative of feasibility. We will consider the intervention acceptable if 70% of participants are satisfied and would recommend it to others.  We will use generalized linear models to compare changes in A1c and medication adherence over time in intervention vs. comparison groups according to the ARMS-D measure of diabetes medication adherence while controlling for baseline differences and changes in housing status over time. Adherence will also be examined with pharmacy refill data (continuous medication gap for non-insulin diabetes medications 0-1.0).92 We will use an intention-to-treat approach including all randomized participants; multiple imputation93 will generate data for those lost to follow-up. Similar modeling approaches will compare psychological wellness, and other biometric and patient-reported outcomes. Data And Safety Monitoring Plan [CONTACT_68954] (PI) will work closely with study staff to monitor the quality of data collected at assessment.

HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] [ADDRESS_75376] the Diabetes Homeless Medication Support (D-Homes) program. D-Homes is a collaborative care intervention using motivational interviewing and behavioral activation alongside education and psychosocial support to improve medication adherence tailored to the experiences of people experiencing homelessness and diabetes (DH). Our team’s central hypothesis is that medication adherence and diabetes self-care (and eventual glycemic control, health care use/cost) will improve with an intervention tailored to the unique context of DH.  This work builds upon part 1 (HSR#19-4622) during which we completed Aim 1 activities to develop the initial Diabetes Homeless Medication Support (D-Homes) treatment manual through focus groups with DH at various levels of glycemic control and interviews with their multi-disciplinary providers. Data from this phase has identified barriers and strategies for medication adherence, patient values regarding medication, and treatment preferences and informed development of part 2 (HSR #20-4863). Part [ADDRESS_75377] cases (n=10-15). We found the D-Homes manual and study procedures are feasible and acceptable to DH as measured by [CONTACT_6270]-report and post-treatment interview but that treatment engagement lessened for participants with the highest degrees of housing instability. This protocol describes part 3, a fully randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_68894] 3. SIGNFICANCE Homeless people in the US face disproportionate risk for premature death in part due to poorly controlled chronic diseases including diabetes. One and a half million unique US adults access homeless shelters annually. However, the total number of people experiencing homelessness (Box) is likely much higher19 with an estimated 7 million additional people living “doubled up” with family/friends in 2014.20 New data recently established that 44% of all adults, and 37% of adults with diabetes, at US community health centers experience unstable housing.3,4 All-cause mortality rates among people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. are 4.5 to 9.6-times higher than the general population. Premature death often results from preventable chronic diseases including diabetes (2%) and its related comorbidities, e.g. heart disease (16%).21 While diabetes prevalence among the homeless and general population is comparable (≈8% in both),[ADDRESS_75378] over five times the odds of diabetes-related emergency or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186].4 This is of particular concern given “metabolic memory,” or long-term vascular stresses which persist after Box. Defining Homelessness:Many definitions of homelessness exist. We adopt that of the U.S. government which includes people who:•Lack “fixed, regular, adequate nighttime residence”•Stay at emergency shelters, temporary living facilities, other places not meant for human habitation•Will imminently lose their primary residence (HEARTH Act, 2011)
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] [ADDRESS_75379] on diabetes control, including by [CONTACT_11026],26,27 there is a paucity of solution-driven research. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments to improve glycemic control in DH as they move across the spectrum of unstable housing.   Medication adherence is a complex behavior critically linked to improved overall and diabetes-specific outcomes. The rate of adherence for all long-term therapi[INVESTIGATOR_68895] 50% in the general (non-homeless) U.S. population due to barriers at various levels including: (i) patient, (ii) medication/disease, (iii) system, and (iv) socioeconomic.28 Among privately insured populations, non-adherence to diabetes and related cardiovascular medications is associated with poor disease control (e.g., higher hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure), as well as increased risk of all-cause mortality and visits to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68896], and total health care costs.29,[ADDRESS_75380], every 10% improvement in diabetes medication adherence reduced hemoglobin A1c by 0.16%.33 The importance of medication adherence is recognized by [CONTACT_68927] (PA-18-722).34  Poor diabetes outcomes among the homeless is caused by [CONTACT_68928]. Non-adherence to medications across disease types is a known concern for homeless people especially when they are young (age <40 yrs.), have comorbid mental health/substance use disorders, experience food insecurity35 and frequent the emergency department. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_68897]-morbidities,36 36% of US homeless adults report unmet needs for prescription medications.37 Small studies find lower medication adherence in homeless patients when directly compared to housed peers.38 DH patients specifically report challenges obtaining, storing, and retaining medication (especially insulin), and stigma surrounding the possession/use of needles.39,40,41,42  Existing evidence-based models targeting medication adherence to improve diabetes will be the starting point for our novel intervention. We will draw from such interventions which target patient and system-level factors43 to improve diabetes self-care activities, including medication adherence, for historically disadvantaged groups. The overarching theoretical model guiding treatment development is the Information Motivation Behavioral Skills model.44 Our proposed treatment is also consistent with the Collaborative Care Model, a care management approach designed for individuals with multiple chronic conditions with known success improving diabetes outcomes in patients with depression.45,46 The Collaborative Care Model frequently uses Motivational Interviewing as the counseling approach, as we plan to in this study.47 Behavioral Activation (BA) is another counseling approach that complements motivational interviewing. Behavioral intervention is empi[INVESTIGATOR_68898] a population with high levels of underlying psychiatric disease (especially depression) and/or psychosocial stress.96-99 BA is easier to train than other empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported counseling treatments and can be delivered with fidelity by [CONTACT_68929]’s level practitioners.100-101 BA is appropriately complemented by [CONTACT_68930], a person-centered, evidence-based approach to behavior change focused on participants’ values and preferences and overcoming expected ambivalence to change.48 It is particularly appealing to groups with historic disadvantage and minority race,48 including the 
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] [ADDRESS_75381] diabetes care guidelines.26  And we will offer problem-solving to address psychosocial needs (including food and housing) modeled after clinic-based approaches for homeless veterans.53,54 These evidence-based interventions offer a starting point for a new intervention which will be tailored to the unique context of DH through the iterative, multi-stakeholder process described below.  2.1 Name [CONTACT_68953]-HOmEless Medication Support (D-HOMES) program. This will be a 12-week in-person, video, and/or phone-based support program centered on providing diabetes education, motivational and goal-setting support, and resource and care coordination (Figure 2). Psychological approaches of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing will be used along with provision of educational materials and tools to support behavior change, see Section 3. for details.

This will support our ultimate goal to determine the efficacy of this 10-session behavioral activation and motivational interviewing support program for DH in a future, fully-powered study. The outcomes we will use to assess this pi[INVESTIGATOR_68901], our ability to recruit and retain participants, the acceptability and process of the comparison group, and follow-up until a 24-week final assessment visit. 3.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim) The secondary objectives will be to refine efficacy measures for future D-Homes evaluation We will: • Assess the acceptability of patient-reported outcome measures to detect changes at follow-up visits #1 and #2 (24-30 weeks). • We will establish and refine laboratory testing protocols for use of a consistent point-of-care A1c machine which our team will control    
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 6 4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1 General Schema of Study Design This is a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_68902] D-HOMES behavioral treatment, see Tables 1 and 2 above. The intervention, see Figure 2 above, targets diabetes education, motivation and goal-setting support, as well as resource and care coordination for people experiencing type 2 diabetes and homelessness (DH). The goal of this treatment development phase of our work is to refine approaches and protocols for further study of our program. 4.1.1 Screening Phase and Baseline Assessment Recruitment protocols are summarized in section 9.5 below but will involve (1) referral from Health Care for the Homeless, Hennepin Healthcare, supportive housing providers, or other community organizations, (2) snowball sampling using advertisements (flyers, video), word of mouth, and referrals via community partners and previous participants, (3) community advertisement using flyers in places such as bus stops, libraries, and shelters, and (4) invitation letters and follow-up calls to eligible patients at Hennepin Healthcare, (5) invitation letters and follow-up phone calls to eligible Hennepin County clinic patients at Health Care for the Homeless and other willing sites. Per review by [CONTACT_68931]’s internal research review committee (IRRC), these letters and calls will be generated by [CONTACT_68932], (6) tabling events with study flyers and snacks at Hennepin Healthcare, Health Care for the Homeless facilities, supportive housing or community partners such as libraries, shelters, and drop-in homeless service centers. Potential subjects will be screened in-person or by [CONTACT_68933]. Congruent with other trials in this area,[ADDRESS_75385] one, support will be given to help the participant schedule a primary care or endocrinology appointment at Hennepin County Health Care for the Homeless, Hennepin Healthcare, or another clinic/health system per participant preference. 4.1.[ADDRESS_75386] completed their planned treatment sessions or requested to end their sessions early. Since the emphasis of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_68903], those ending early will be given particular attention so that their insights and experiences can shape future adaptations to the intervention and study design. 4.2 Allocation to Groups and Blinding Participants will be randomized to either the intervention or a control group (1:1). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_68934] (unstable (e.g., shelter, staying outside) vs. 
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 7 more stable (e.g., worry about rent payment, supportive or transitional housing)). Randomization will occur after baseline assessment visit #[ADDRESS_75387] (“diabetes wellness coach”), and they will have a 4-week period within which to complete any missed visits. Intervention participants will receive monthly booster calls from coaches after weekly coaching ends through week [ADDRESS_75388] information beginning at 6 weeks through week 24. All participants will also complete a two follow-up assessment visits. To maximize participation, these follow-up visits can occur 1 week after intervention and up to 30 weeks after enrollment.  4.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected Enrollment for the study will continue until [ADDRESS_75389] definition (Box). This is justified given the premature morbidity and mortality of this population from diabetes and related comorbidities. While not formally considered a vulnerable population, DH are a population requiring special attention with regard to safety and respectful engagement in research. A consent quiz will be used to ensure that no individuals unable to consent are recruited similar to protocols used in part 2 of this study (HSR#20-4863). See Consent Quiz. Furthermore, we will continue working closely with community providers in this area and our multi-stakeholder team to ensure we achieve cultural congruence with the ways we approach and engage this population in research as well as with the planned study protocols.  No patients who have chosen to opt out of research in their annual consent process through the health system will contact[CONTACT_68935].  4.5 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 4.5.1   Inclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria: 1.

HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 9 5 STUDY PROCEDURES 5.1 Qualifying Visit  5.1.1 Eligibility, Screening Visit As outlined in Table 1, before consent, interested participants will complete a screening. This will cover inclusion and exclusion criteria and briefly describe the intervention to ensure the participant is aware and willing to commit to study. 5.1.2  Baseline Assessment and Run-in After the screening visit, after the participant’s signed consent at baseline assessment visit #1, the medical record will be accessed. Participants’ diabetes diagnosis, A1c results, medication list, frequency of refills, primary care team, and pattern of clinic/emergency department/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68904] [ADDRESS_75392] diabetes at this point, they will be excluded from the study. We will also process their point-of-care A1c after visit #[ADDRESS_75393]: • Review Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria • Informed Consent, HIPPA authorization • Demographics/Medical History/Medication list • Release of information for health systems used in last 12 mo.  • Release of information for insurance claims data in the last 12 mo.  • Biometrics: BP, height and weight, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) o Alc testing involves the collection of a 1.5 µL blood sample via fingerstick or venipuncture • Patient-reported outcome survey items (See Table 1) 5.2  Study Intervention  For participants randomized to the intervention group, they will be offered 10 coaching sessions over 12 weeks. These will be conducted in-person, via secure video, and/or by [CONTACT_648]-based per participant preference and COVID-19 safety protocols. The treatment will center on providing diabetes education, motivational and goal-setting support, and resource and care coordination (Figure 2).  In-person assessment visits will be conducted at private spaces convenient to the participant including Hennepin Healthcare, Health Care for the Homeless sites, or at participant homes (see Home Visit Protocol). All in-person assessment and treatment visits will follow current guidance from HHRI and Hennepin Healthcare about social distancing and use of personal protective equipment. In-person treatment visits will be arranged that may include the participants home  Video visits will be conducted via a secure Zoom or Teams link (using HHRI, Hennepin Healthcare, and/or Hennepin County HIPAA secure technology) or Facetime if the participant is using an Apple device.  
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 10 Phone visits will be conducted via a study or office phone or the PI’s work phone. If participants have no working phone, a study phone will be issued to participants and will sign a Study Issued Cell Phone/Tablet Agreement (See Phone/Tablet Agreement). Psychological approaches of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing will be used along with provision of educational materials and tools to support behavior change (See Tools and Education Materials). Coaches will tailor which tools and educational materials are given to which participants depending on participant need as well as the specific goals that are mutually set. E.g.) A participant with 10 medications per day may benefit from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_68905]. E.g.) A participant with many appointments for behavioral and physical health care may benefit from a pocket calendar. Financial value of tools ranges from $4.99 (glucose log book) to $17.91 (Adhesives for Continuous Glucose Monitor).  Approved communication channels will be used to support participant’s goal setting (e.g. reminders) and arrange study related visits. Participants will be offered up to [ADDRESS_75394] visit will immediately follow the baseline #[ADDRESS_75395] visit are to (a) establish rapport, (b) assess baseline diabetes medication adherence and self-care behaviors, (c) describe the rationale for the treatment. The interventionist will get to know the participant and discuss things of importance in their life. She will complete a detailed assessment of prescribed diabetes medications and use of pharmacies and health care clinics/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68906]. The interventionist will also: • Review boundaries for sessions, confidentiality, and mandated reporting • Educate the patient on the rationale of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing • Assess co-morbidities (e.g. mental illness, substance use disorder, heart disease) and contextual factors (e.g. housing status, social supports, food security)  • Assess existing diabetes care team; refer if no team in place. • Assign self-monitoring goals per behavioral activation 5.2.2 Visit 2  The goals of the second visit are to complete a values assessment and provide relevant/needed health behavior tools. The interventionist will use a list to prompt the values assessment based on the Valued Living Questionnaire.96 She will: • Identify participant values • Provide health behavior tools as desired/needed (e.g., pi[INVESTIGATOR_16582], calendar; see Tools and Education Materials for details) • Identify valued activities goals to promote diabetes medication adherence and psychosocial wellness specific to the participant’s values and context • Problem-solve foreseeable barriers to behavior change goals 
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 11 5.2.3 Visits 3-5  The goals of visits 3-5 will be to advance the practice of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing to promote improved diabetes knowledge/confidence, and reduced logistical and emotional barriers specifically related to medication and other diabetes adherence. During these visits the interventionist will: • Review engagement in health and wellness-promoting valued activities • Identify valued activities goals to promote diabetes medication adherence and psychosocial wellness specific to the participant’s values and context • Problem solve foreseeable barriers to emergent behavior change  • Assess for inclusion of diet, exercise goals to enhance diabetes adherence goals 5.2.[ADDRESS_75396] will:  • Introduce advanced or challenging valued activity goals • Explore ways to increase synergy between psychosocial wellness and diabetes health behavior goals 5.2.[ADDRESS_75397] will: • Plan and implement strategies to maintain long-term diabetes adherence goals 5.2.6 Intervention group booster calls Interventionists will offer monthly booster calls after the end of the intervention period (approx. 12-[ADDRESS_75398]-enrollment), and prior to the follow-up assessment visit #2. Contact [CONTACT_68936] a once-monthly to reinforce planned behavioral activation goals, update participant contact [CONTACT_3031], and arrange final follow up visit. 5.2.7 Comparison Group Participants randomized into the comparison group will receive one 15 to 30-minute diabetes education session. Interventionists (coaches) will read the content of 3 diabetes educational handouts about (1) general descriptions of type 2 diabetes, (2) healthy eating, and (3) physical activity. Handouts are produced in alignment with American Diabetes Association guidelines by a community group (https://learningaboutdiabetes.org/) and have been used in previous diabetes behavioral trials118 with participants in low-income situations. Participants will receive a standard pi[INVESTIGATOR_68907]. Participants will receive a resource sheet with referral information to establish health care, mental health support, or to access local resources for housing, food, and other basic needs. Comparison group participants will be contact[CONTACT_36165] (non-interventionists) once-monthly starting [ADDRESS_75399] information and remind them of the timeline for follow-up assessments.  
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 12 5.2.8 Follow-up Assessments The follow-up assessments will be completed by a blinded research staff member. The staff person will assess: • Vital Signs: BP • Height and Weight • Hemoglobin A1c • Medication review • Patient-reported measures, see Table [ADDRESS_75400] will work with intervention participants to set treatment goals related to improved diabetes care. These may include between-visit text messages, calls, e-mails, or private messages on secure social media platforms per the participant’s preference. These will be done with input and agreement by [CONTACT_2299]. The interventionist will also respond to participant-initiated between visit communications.  Study staff will respond to participant-initiated communications from comparison group participants. They will refer participants to locally available resources on the handout for any expressed needs. Should communications become too frequent or surpass agreed upon boundaries with any participants, staff will be guided to set boundaries and limit contact [CONTACT_68937]. Vickery and/or Busch.  5.[ADDRESS_75401] Completion/Withdrawal Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence to study treatment or visit schedules and adverse events (AEs). If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on the case report form. 5.6.1 Early Termination Study Visit  Any participant who withdraws will be contact[CONTACT_68938] [INVESTIGATOR_68908].

We will assess diabetes history, housing history, medication use, communication preferences/access, and also collect basic demographic data, (e.g. age, gender). See DH Aim 3 Screener Script for question structure. During the baseline and follow-up assessment visits data will be collected using the following procedures: Demographics/ Medical History Participants will be given a verbal survey at either the Baseline 1 or Baseline 2 visit to add to data collected in pre-consent screening.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_22871]: health insurance, education, medical history, and current living situation.  Medical record request/abstraction Signed release of information forms will be collected for participants at their primary care clinic/preferred health system and at Hennepin Healthcare and Hennepin County affiliate clinics (including Health Care for the Homeless). Once signed consent is obtained, EPIC records at Hennepin Healthcare will be directly accessed for abstraction with signed consent. Release of information (ROI) forms will be collected for outside health systems patients have used. ROI forms will be sent, via secure e-mail or fax, to Health Information Management offices at outside health systems. Return of information will occur via secure file transfer system preferred by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_68909].  Returned records will be abstracted by [CONTACT_464].

We will work directly with Hennepin County per instructions of the Minnesota Department of Human Services Medicaid office to securely obtain records at the end of the study on all participants. Signed consents will be sent via secure fax or secure file transfer process. 
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 14 Pharmacy and health care claims data detailing medication refill patterns as well as clinic, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and emergency department use across all health systems will be abstracted. We will explore the feasibility of using pre-established protocols to examine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68910].109  Biometric data The following biometric data will be collected from participants at baseline and both follow-up assessment visits. See Biometric Data for detailed information on how these will be measured: • Blood pressure • Height • Weight • Hemoglobin A1c--Participants will receive a copy of their results. See HgA1c Result for A1c results sheet. Medication review Patients will be asked to bring a list of all their medications to the Baseline [ADDRESS_75404]. Patient-reported survey measures Formal assessment surveys will be collected at Baseline and follow-up assessment visits as described in Table 1. Satisfaction with intervention At the 16-week assessment visit, the assessor (who is not the interventionist) will collect input about the participant’s experiences during the intervention.  Participant satisfaction will be assessed by [CONTACT_68939], an 8-item measure developed in the mental health field.[ADDRESS_75405] the following eventual efficacy measures to prepare for later, fully-powered testing at baseline and both follow-up assessment visits (Table 1): • Hemoglobin A1c (primary) • Adherence to diabetes medications (ARMS-D) (secondary) • Adherence to all medications (ASK-12) (secondary) • Diabetes self-care (DSMQ) (secondary) • Difficulties with diabetes management (PAID) (secondary) 6.[ADDRESS_75406] safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_68926]. We will also follow safety protocols in case we identify dangerous blood pressure, or heart rate values at baseline or follow-up assessment visits. See Section 8 for details.    
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 15 7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 7.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint of this study is the satisfaction of participants in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_37087] (via CSQ-8). The feasibility and acceptability of study protocols for recruitment, retention, and randomization are also important. We will assess this by [CONTACT_68940], and the assessment and treatment visits we can deliver (i.e., participant’s attendance and follow-up with scheduled sessions and treatment activities). In addition to above outcomes, we will carefully track the number and types of between-treatment communications with participants (who initiated communication; form of communication: text, calls, e-mails, etc.). We will consider the study feasible if we enroll 75% of those screened who meet inclusion criteria, and 75% of enrolled participants complete at least one follow-up. We will consider 50% session attendance as indicative of feasibility. We will consider the intervention acceptable if 70% of participants are satisfied and would recommend it to others.  We will also analyze our primary clinical endpoint of change in A1c between intervention and comparison groups between baseline follow-up visit #1 (approx. 12-16 weeks)  if it changes from baseline to between intervention.  7.2 Secondary Endpoints Secondary endpoints will include the following changes from baseline to follow-up visit #1 (approx. 12-16 weeks) between intervention and comparison groups. • Psychological wellness (SF-12, MHI-5) • Adherence to diabetes medications (ARMS-D) (secondary) • Adherence to all medications (ASK-12) (secondary) • Diabetes self-care (DSMQ) (secondary) • Difficulties with diabetes management (PAID) (secondary) Secondary endpoints will also include change from baseline to follow-up visit #2 (approx. 24-30 weeks) of A1c to assess sustained change of our primary endpoint. We will also complete exploratory analyses on the change from baseline to follow-up visit #2 of: • Adherence to diabetes medications (ARMS-D)  • Adherence to all medications (ASK-12)  • Diabetes self-care (DSMQ)  • Difficulties with diabetes management (PAID)  Exploratory analyses will further measure changes from baseline to follow-up visits #1 and #2 of other self-reported and claims-measures will be assessed including housing status, substance use, and other biometric measures (BP, BMI). Exploratory analyses will also compare self-reported adherence measures (ARMS-D and ASK-12) to measures built from medication refill patterns in insurance claims.

We will use t-tests to examine the differences in CSQ-8 scores between the intervention and comparison groups; we hypothesize no difference. We will also examine the experiences of White vs. Black, Native American, and Hispanic participants. We will also generate summaries of the age, gender, and race/ethnicity of people at the highest and lowest quintiles of CSQ-8 scores. We will use generalized linear models to compare changes in A1c and medication adherence (ARMS-D and ASK-12) over time in intervention vs. comparison groups. We will control for baseline differences and changes in housing status over time. Adherence will also be examined with pharmacy refill data which we will compare to self-report (ARMS-D and ASK-12).92 We will use an intention-to-treat approach including all randomized participants; multiple imputation93 will generate data for those lost to follow-up. Similar modeling approaches will compare psychological wellness, blood pressure, and health care use outcomes. 7.4.[ADDRESS_75409]. Busch (HSR#17-4351) as well as the current literature.110   
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 17 8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 8.1  Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be closely monitored throughout the study in accordance with HHRI IRB definitions and policies.  8.2  Adverse Event Reporting Unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others that occur during the course of this study and SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Attachment EEE: Prompt Reporting Guidelines. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review. Adverse event reports will be reviewed annually with the HHRI IRB to ensure participant safety. [CONTACT_68954] will be responsible for completing Adverse Events Forms should an event occur. She will report Serious Adverse Events to the HHRI IRB within 24 hours of having received notice of the event.  Drs. Vickery, Busch, and Connett will collaboratively gather any information needed to investigate any reported safety events and determine subsequent action. Any subsequent action will be documented and reported to the HHRI IRB and the Program Officer at NIH.  8.3  Investigator Reporting of a Serious Adverse Event to Sponsor Reporting to the National Institutes of Health will be completed as required by [CONTACT_68941]. 8.4  Medical Emergencies If non-urgent psychological distress arises in participants during study related activities, study staff will provide a handout about local mental health resources, including a 24-hour support line and psychiatric emergency room (See Resource List). If non-urgent physical health needs arise in participants, study staff will provide written resources about health care available through Health Care for the Homeless and Hennepin Healthcare (See Resource List). If an emergency physical or behavioral health situation arises, study staff will arrange for immediate clinical support from PI ([CONTACT_68954]), Health Care for the Homeless clinical staff (who have a walk-in treatment model), the Hennepin County mental health crisis team (COPE Line, available by [CONTACT_14379]-person 24hrs./day, 7 days/week), or emergency medical services as appropriate. This event will be written up and reviewed by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_68954]) and primary mentor ([CONTACT_68956]) within 48 hours of the event and reported to the IRB if needed. If measured blood pressure surpasses SBP>180 or DBP>[ADDRESS_75410] within a study visit and falls <60 or >400/error, study staff will page [CONTACT_68954] who will provide clinical assessment of symptoms and make referral or arrangement for immediate transfer to appropriate treatment as needed. As deemed necessary by [CONTACT_68942]/or HHRI IRB, issues related to patient safety will be reviewed with mental health or medical professionals at HCMC not affiliated 
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 18 with the study who will provide recommendations for withdrawal from the study, referrals for additional care, or other necessary action.  9 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 9.1 Treatment Assignment Methods 9.1.1  Randomization or Other Assignment Randomization will occur at the 2nd baseline visit, and will be done using a pre-generated randomization schedule in REDCap. Randomization will be stratified into 2 strata based on severity of housing instability: “unstable” (e.g., living in shelter, staying outside) and “more stable” (e.g., history of homelessness that’s now resolved, worry about rent payment, subsidized housing). 9.1.[ADDRESS_75411] follow-up assessment visit, a different blinded assessor will complete the 24-week visit. 9.2 Data Collection and Management We will assign study ID numbers to all participants. Study IDs will be used on all study documents. Consent forms will be stored separately and will not be associated with study IDs when stored. Tracking forms will ensure each enrolled participant has a completed consent form. If needed due to Covid-19, we will follow our HHRI-approved e-consent procedures (see Consent/Assent Documents). Data from self-reported survey items administered during screening interviews and assessment visits will be entered and stored in REDCap. If needed (e.g. no available wifi at community screening event), paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_68911]. Physical copi[INVESTIGATOR_68912] a locked file drawer separate from consent documents.  Electronic health record access will take place in Hennepin Healthcare EPIC or via faxed paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_68913]. Data from electronic health records will be extracted by a trained research staff member and entered into standard forms using REDCap. All treatment sessions will be audio recorded and reviewed during coach supervision meetings with Drs. Vickery and Busch. Once audio recordings are uploaded to the HHRI-maintained computer network, they will be deleted from the audio recording equipment. Audio recordings will be destroyed on or before the end of the grant period, 12/31/2024.  Since assessment visits may be conducted at locations away from the research offices of the PI, extreme care will be taken to keep study materials in the possession of research staff at all times. Immediately after visits, consent forms, hemoglobin A1c results, audio equipment, and other study materials will be returned to the secure research offices of Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute. Each office has a locked door in a badge-access-only wing of the Institute. Signed consent documents will further be stored in a locked file drawer whose key will be stored in a separate locked key box. Study data, including all audio recordings will be stored and analyzed on [CONTACT_68954] and her staff’s HHRI-maintained computer network. This network is robust, secure, and has

Vickery and staff will comply with any necessary software, hardware, and data storage updates to maintain the security of this system under the direction of the HHRI IT Department. The identifiers will be destroyed on or before the completion date of the grant, 12/31/2024.  The other data will be retained for three years.   9.[ADDRESS_75413] of research (i.e., both HIPAA and CITI trainings). Identifying information will not be reported in any publication.   No identifiable data will be used for future study. If request for data is received, we will obtain a data use agreement between the provider (the PI) of the data and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at Hennepin Healthcare) before sharing a limited dataset which will not include PHI.  9.4  Regulatory and Ethical Considerations 9.4.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan This treatment development study (N=54), does not meet NIH criteria requiring a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) due to the small sample size and as we expect it to be considered minimal risk by [CONTACT_68943].  However, we have a detailed data safety and monitoring plan. [CONTACT_68954] will have primary responsibility for monitoring all procedures for data collection, analysis, and storage. Any adverse events, breaches of confidentiality, or other data or safety issues that arise will be discussed during weekly visits with [CONTACT_68956] (primary mentor) or sooner if required and immediately brought to the attention of [CONTACT_68957] (biostats. co-mentor). [CONTACT_68957] has served on numerous DSMBs for large NIH trials. If needed, Drs. Busch and Connett will locate representatives independent of the study team for input. All issues related to patient safety (e.g., psychiatric distress) will be reviewed with medical and mental health professionals at Hennepin Healthcare not affiliated with the study who will provide recommendations for withdrawal from the study, referrals for additional care, or other necessary action. If requested by [CONTACT_68944], a DSMB will be convened. 9.4.2  Risk Assessment Discomfort or distress when completing assessment and treatment procedures. Some participants may feel uncomfortable or distressed answering personal or private questions during assessment or treatment. Some participants may also feel uncomfortable or distressed 
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 20 due to the collection of physical measures (e.g., weight). In previous studies by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Busch, when individuals did report discomfort in these situations, it was mild.  We minimize discomfort or distress with three key approaches: (1) clearly explaining the study and emphasizing the optional nature of participation, (2) conducting all treatment sessions and assessment visits in private settings, (3) staff training about the sensitivity of chronic health conditions and the specific circumstances of homelessness including how to offer appropriate support. Confidentiality or loss of privacy. We will collect potentially sensitive information about participants; if released inappropriately, participants may experience embarrassment or distress. The seriousness of the consequences would depend on the nature of the information revealed and to whom the information was revealed. See Section 9.[ADDRESS_75414] this would be exacerbated from trial participation, it is possible that a minority of participants will experience worsening of mental illness, depression, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_68914]. See Section 8.4 above for our detailed safety plan to address this risk. 9.4.3  Potential Benefits of Trial Participation Potential benefits for participants include free diabetes support with a goal of improved diabetes self-management which can reduce their morbidity from this disease. Free counseling related to psychological wellness may reduce depression symptoms, stress, and may improve participants’ quality of life. Furthermore, there may be indirect benefits for participants in knowing they have helped promote research to develop an intervention that could help other people at later times.  9.4.[ADDRESS_75415] the potential benefits to participants to outweigh the low risks of this study. 9.5 Recruitment Strategy We will use a variety of recruitment methods throughout our study to identify participants: 1. We will include use the electronic health record system at Hennepin Healthcare. We will ask staff in the Analytics Center for Excellence to use the existing homeless indicator,[ADDRESS_75416] eligible patients by [CONTACT_68945] a follow-up phone call—a method we’ve used successfully in the past to recruit unstably housed individuals (see Recruitment Materials: Letter) Care will be taken to ensure letters emphasize the voluntary nature of participation and to emphasize that the choice to participate will not impact receipt of health care at HCMC or other health systems. 2. We will recruit participants via personal invitations staff at local service delivery sites for people experiencing homelessness. This includes Health Care for the Homeless and other Hennepin County public health clinics and housing workers as 
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 21 well as community organizations offering rent and housing support in our region. We will provide flyers to these staff to distribute to their clients and/or to post in appropriate areas of their facilities. The postcard flyer will include an email and phone number to invite interested patients to contact [CONTACT_16133] (see Recruitment Materials: Flyer).  We will also support these partners to send letters (see Recruitment Materials: Letter) to eligible participants and to call them in follow-up. We will also support partners to share our recruitment video (see uploaded video file) with their patients, clients, and within their own communication channels. When interested participants are identified, they will be passed along to our study team via email or study phone.  3. We will use snowball sampling. We will ask community partners and previous participants to distribute our study flyer to or refer friends/acquaintances who might be interested. 4. We will use convenience sampling at health care and community housing sites. Study staff will go to sites with informational materials about diabetes, study flyers, hygiene kits, study-branded promotional materials (pi[INVESTIGATOR_68915], socks, etc.), and low-glycemic snacks in order to engage with community members about the study face-to-face. This may include screening on-site with fingerstick A1c testing, which is independent of research protocols, and scheduling of baseline assessments with interested persons. Our recruitment video may be played at these events. Information sessions will include both one-on-one conversations and tabling sessions that take place at a variety of healthcare and community settings with permission from each site’s leadership, including Hennepin Healthcare facilities, Healthcare for the Homeless clinics, libraries, shelters, housing facilities, and community or social service agencies. 5. We will post our flyer in locations frequented by [CONTACT_68946] (e.g., bus stops, drop-in centers, shelter bulletin boards, libraries, etc.). 9.6  Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization We will collect signed consent and HIPAA authorization from all participants (see Consent/assent documents). The consent will also include HIPAA authorization to review their electronic health record at Hennepin Healthcare and any other systems where they have gotten care in the last year. We will also ask them to sign consent for us to obtain insurance claims data for one year before and one year after study participation from their insurance provider. Staff will review consent documents with participants and monitor their comprehension using teach back methods. After presentation of key features of the document, research staff will administer a 4-question consent quiz to confirm comprehension from all patient participants (see Consent Quiz). This quiz will be administered orally and participants must answer all questions on the consent quiz correctly to consent. Research staff may administer the quiz up to [ADDRESS_75417] answers prior to the second administration. Any and all questions will be answered by [CONTACT_68947].  
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] [ADDRESS_75418]. Vickery deems remote work preferred for public health reasons, baseline visits 1 and 2, treatment visits, and outcome visits can be conducted by [CONTACT_68948] (HHRI Zoom and/or HHRI/HCMC or Hennepin County Teams). See Consent/assent documents for our e-consent protocol. 9.7  Payment to Subjects/Families Participants will be paid for their participation in three ways: (1) Reimbursement for travel, parking, and cell phone minutes/text messages for all assessment and treatment visits (2) Payment for time, effort, and inconvenience of assessment visits (3) Gifts in the form of tools to enhance behavior change goals 9.7.1  Reimbursement for travel, parking, and cell phone minutes/text messages Reimbursement for travel/parking for in-person visits will happen at each in-person visit.  For in-person coaching or assessment visits at Hennepin Healthcare, participants will receive 2 bus tokens, $[ADDRESS_75419] enrollment visit, we will mail them two bus tokens or arrange transportation for the participant.   We will provide monthly reimbursement for phone minutes/text messages. For participants using their own personal phone, they will receive a monthly stipend to support their phone bill. They will be paid up to $[ADDRESS_75420]. Participants without a personal phone will be provided with a study phone to use for the 6 months of the study (no stipend).

This includes a fingerstick blood draw with research staff or the option of a fingerstick or veinous blood draw at the CSC 2 lab at visits #1, 3, and 4. We will compensate participants with either cash or via ClinCard using the following schedule:  Assessment Visits 
   
HSR IRB-FY2021-317 [Version 05/19/2023] 23 #1 #2 #3  #4 Assessment Payment $20 $30 $40 $60 Maximum total compensation will be $150. The amount and form of these payments were set with input and approval by [CONTACT_29472]-stakeholder research team of people with lived experience and multi-disciplinary providers. In the case that the specimen from visit #1,3, or 4 clots, we will offer an extra $10 to repeat the fingerstick or veinous blood draw at the lab. We will offer this $10 once for each assessment visit that requires a blood draw (three total).

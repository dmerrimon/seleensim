 I. Research Plan   
40 older adults (70 -85y) will be recruited from the local [LOCATION_011] area based on their performance on  the short 
physical performance battery (SPPB), a measure of lower extremity physical function that includes standing 
balance, a 4 -m walk and chair stand tests[1]. The SPPB has been extensively validated as predictive of future 
disability risk and mortality in older adults[1]. High -functioning (HF; SPPB ≥ 11) and low -functioning (LF; SPPB 
≤8)[2] groups will each contain 20 subjects (10 men, 10 women).  Gut microbial composition is affected by  [CONTACT_654][3, 
4]. Similarly, sex and BMI are associated with gut microbiome composition[5-7]. With the goal of minimizing gut 
microbial variability, I propose to recruit HF and LF subjects that are matched for age, sex and BMI but are 
different in terms of lean mass and physical function.  
 
At baseline, sub jects will pr ovide a blood and stool sample that will be subjected to serum metabolomics and 
fecal sample 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene profiling, respectively. Serum metabolomics provides an 
analytical description of complex biological media by [CONTACT_630073] a large number of small molecule metabolites 
in a given biological sample[8]. Fecal sample 16S rRNA gene profiling will be used to identify the bacteria l relative 
abundance that is present within each taxonomic level  in each fecal sample . Lean mass and physical function will 
be measured in all subjects . Associations between serum metabolites, fecal bacteria,  and between fecal bacteria 
and serum metabolites with the differentiation of  HF from LF , and that are associated with lean mass and specific 
measures of physical function will be determined . In additi on, associations between gut bacteria with circulating 
markers of insulin resistance and endotoxemia will be identified. Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_630053] g about the role of 
gut bacteria on mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of lean mass and physical function in older adults.  The 
causative role of gut bacteria on the maintenance of lean mass and physical function in older adults will be 
examined by [CONTACT_630074] -free mice.  
 
After 1 month, to determine the reproducibility  of the baseline gut bacterial associations with lean mass and 
physical function , study subjects will return  to provide a fecal sample that will be subjected to 16S rRNA profiling. 
Lean mass and physical function will be measured, and associations between fecal bacteria that collectively 
differentiate HF from LF, and that are associated with lean mass and specif ic measures of physical function will 
be identified  and compared with baseline findings .  
 
Statistical power: Sample size estimates are based on gut  bacterial associations with the GFI[9]. Means ± SD for 
Bacteroides /Prevotella  of 26.3 ± 13.2 and 14.8 ± 15.[ADDRESS_840410] size of 0.81, a value that is sufficient to obtain 80% power at a type -I error probability of 0.05 with 
a study sample size of 40 subjects . To achieve  this recruitment goal,  up to150 subjects will sign the Preadmission 
ICF, with the goal of 40 participants completing the study.  
 
Blood and Stool Collection: Following an overnight , 12-hour fast (beginning between 8PM -12AM the day 
before) , eligible candida tes will provide a blood sample  during the initial visit (baseline) and 1 -month study visits. 
At the screening visit, eligible s ubjects will be provided with a stool collection kit so that they may provide a stool 
sample withi n the 18 -hour period that prece des their baseline and 1 -month visits. Fasting is optional for providing  
the stool sample .  
 
Measurement of insulin, glucose , lipopolysaccharide (LPS)  and physical function: Serum measurement of 
insulin and glucose are used to calculate the homeostasi s model assessment (HOMA -IR), a circulating index of 
insulin resistance[10]. LPS is a component of gram -negative bacterial cell walls that can appear in the blood by 
[CONTACT_630075][11], is a circulating marke r of metabolic endotoxemia[12].  
LPS induces insulin resistance[12], myotube atrophy and decreased  muscle function in vitro[13, 14], and decreases 
muscle mass in rodents[15]. Insulin, glucose  and LPS  will be measured by [CONTACT_630076] 
(NEL ) at the Jean Mayer HNRCA at Tufts University.  
 
3 
 Measures of physical function including the SPPB, leg press one repetition maximum (1 RM) and 400 -m will be 
performed by [CONTACT_630077][16]. The impo rtance of 
measuring the SPPB, the leg press 1 RM  and 400-m is illustrated by [CONTACT_630078][1, 17, 18] and an increased all -cause mortality risk[1, 18, 19].  
 
Measurement of Dietary Intake : To account for the influence of dietary intake on the gut microbiome, three 24 -
hour dietary recalls will be collected from enrolled study subjects . Two of these recalls will be collected on  the 
two days prior to the baseline visit. The final dietary recall will be performed on the day of the baseline visit, for 
a total of three 24 -hour dietary recalls.  
 
AIM 1 : Identify a ssociations between gut bacteria and circulating metabolites that collectively differentiate 
HF from LF, and are associated with  lean mass and physical function in older adults.  [CONTACT_630103] recently 
reported significant associations between circulating gut bacteria -related metabolites[20-22] with lean and skeletal 
muscle mass[23] and with measures of physical function[16], evidence that suggests a role for gut bacteria on the 
maintenance of these outcomes in older adults. To date, studies aimed at identification of associations between 
gut bacteria and circulating meta bolites with lean mass have yet to be published, whereas two studies have 
reported associations between gut bacteria with function[9, 24]. However, the indices  used to measure function were 
not spe cific for physical function, as questions about vision, hearing, cognition and psychosocial function were 
included[25-27]. Therefore, the objective of AIM 1 is to characterize the association between fecal bacteria and 
circulating metabolites that collectively differentiate HF from LF, and that are associated with lean mass and 
physical function in older adults . 
 
Identification of bacterial taxa present in fecal samples:  Fecal sample 16S rRNA gene profiling will be used 
to identify the fecal bacteria relative abundance that is pr esent within each taxonomic level. The Phoenix 
Laboratory at the Tufts University Medical Center[28] will extract fecal sample DNA, generate  16S rRNA 
amplicons , and assemble amplicon pools for high -through put sequencing. The Tufts University Genomics Core 
Facility[29] will then use an Illumina MiSeq System (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to target the V4 region of the 16S 
rRNA gene. 16S rRNA sequences will be quality filtered, clustered into Operational Taxonomic U nit (OTUs)  and 
further analyzed using QIIME ( quantitative insights into microbial ecology)[30]. Use of 16S rRNA gene profiling 
allows for the determination of bacterial taxa other than E. coli  and Enterobacteriaceae  that may be different in 
HF when comp ared with LF older adults. For example, various bacterial species other than E. coli  are capable of 
BCAA synthesis[31]. Furthermore, the BCAA catabolic metabolites 2 -oxoisovalerate and 4 -methyl -2-
oxopentanoate are negatively associated with colonic Lactobacillus spp . abundance[21].  
 
Bacterial taxa that differentiate HF from LF older adults : Principal co -ordinate 
analysis (PCoA) of the phylogeny based Unifrac distance metric[32], which are derived 
from OTUs[33] will be used to determine if the overall gut microbial profile in HF is 
significantly different when compared with LF older adults . The analysis of 
similar ities function in the statistical software package PRIMER 6 (PRIMER -E Ltd., 
Lutton, [LOCATION_006][34]) will be used to determine between -group statistical significance 
(p≤0.05). To identify bacterial taxa and relative abundance that are significantly 
different in HF when compared with LF older adults, linear discriminant analysis 
effect size (LEFSE)[35] will be used.  LEFSE is an algorithm for high -dimensional 
biomarker discovery and explanation that identifies bacterial taxa that characterize 
the difference between two or more biological conditions.  
 
Test the causative role of human gut bacteria  on the maintenance of lean mass and physical function : 
Although identification of gut bacteria that are associated with lean mass and physical function is an important 
observation,  transplanting intact uncultured human fecal microbiota into recipi[INVESTIGATOR_630054] -free mice permits the 
donors’ communities to be replicated and the causative role of their microbiota on outcome measures to be

 discerned.  For example, transplantation of human gut microbiota from 4 female twins discordant for kwashiorkor 
(the condition caused by [CONTACT_630079]) into germ -free mice resulted in 86 -90% of species -
level taxa and ~90% of the functions encoded by [CONTACT_183947]’s microbiome being  found in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_241628], thereby 
[CONTACT_630080] a causal factor on kwashiorkor[36].   
 
Transplantation of gut microbiota from a healthy human adult into germ -free mice resulted in all bacterial phyla, 
92% of bacterial classes and 88% of genus -level taxa being detected in the feces of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_630054] -free mice[37]. 
Human gut bacteria -containing mice fed a high -fat western diet gained significantly more adiposity during the 
two weeks following transplantation than mice that consumed a low -fat, plant polysaccharide -rich diet[37], 
evidence that demonstrates a causative role for diet -induced increases in adiposity by [CONTACT_630081]. 
Similarly, transplantation of human gut microbiota from 3 tw ins (2 female and 1 male) discordant for obesity into 
germ -free mice resulted in ~75% of family -level bacterial taxa and 99.7% of the functions encoded by [CONTACT_183947]’s 
microbiome being  represented in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_241628], thereby [CONTACT_225243] a greater increase i n adiposity in mice 
colonized with fecal microbiota from obese, when compared with its lean co -twin[38]. 
 
Collectively, these studies demonstrate that transfer  of gut bacteria from humans into germ -free mice is highly 
efficient, functions encoded by [CONTACT_630082], and phenotypes are transmissible. The 
objective of AIM [ADDRESS_840411] the causative role of human gut bacteria on the maintenance of lean mass and physical 
function by [CONTACT_630083] -free mice.  
 
Statistical Power: Germ -free mice colonized with  fecal bacteria from o bese humans gained significantly more 
adiposity than germ -free mice colonized with fecal bacteria from their lean co -twin (10.0% ± 5.0% compared 
with 0.1% ± 2.0%) , a result that was significant 15 days after colonization[38]. Based on these data, the resulting 
effect size of 2.6 is sufficient to obtain  99% power at a type -I error probability of 0.05 with a sample size of 12 
human subjects. Accordingly, with the  goal of identifying a similar change in lean mass and physical function, I 
propose to transfer fecal bacteria from 12 older adults into germ -free mice.  
 
III.2.a Colonization of germ -free mice with human gut bacteria from HF and LF older adults: Fecal samples 
from 6 HF (3 males, 3 females) and 6 LF (3 males, 3 females) older adults will be transferred into sex -matched 
(with the goal of  minimizing sex -associated gut microbial variability[6, 7]) C57BL/6J germ -free mice for a duration 
of [ADDRESS_840412] Digestive Disease Center 
(HDDC; [LOCATION_011], MA). The transmissible effect of host phenotype by [CONTACT_630084] C57BL/6J germ -free mice[36-38]. Further more, the homogenous genetic 
background provided by [CONTACT_630085] C57BL/6J germ -free mice allows for  a cleaner system to dissect signals from gut 
bacteria -host interactions, and improves experimental reproducibility , when compared with genetically 
heterogeneous GFM[39]. One fecal sample from each human donor will be transferred into 5 separate germ -free 
mice (based on the range of germ -free mice used in human fecal transfer experiments[36, 38]), resulting in 60 mice 
colonized with human gut microbiota. 5 germ -free mice will not be colonized with fecal bacteria from older adults 
(germ -free control group). All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_630055] a commercial, sterilized mouse chow[38]. 
Food consumption will be measured daily to ensure that changes in lean mass or physical function do not result 
because of differences in food intake.  
 
III.2.b Measurement and analysis of the change in lean mass and physical function in mice colonized with 
human gut bacteria: Lean mass and physical function in mice colonized with human gut bacteria will be 
measured on day 0 (prior to colonization), 9, 18, [ADDRESS_840413] -colonization at the HDDC. Lean mass will 
be measured with use of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (EchoMRI -3in1 instrument, Houston, TX)[38]. 
Muscle strength will be measured using a grip strength meter for mice (Technical and Scientiﬁc Equ ipment 
GmbH, Bad Homburg, [LOCATION_013])[40]. Each mouse will ﬁrmly grab the pulling bar of the grip strength meter with 
both forepaws and then pulled gently backwards  until it releases its grip. The peak force of each trial is considered 
the grip strength. A 1-liter beaker filled with water will be used as a swimming pool to test endurance capacity[41]. 
5 
 A weight (10% of body weight) will be attached to the tail of a mouse, which is then placed in the water. The 
amount of time that the mouse is able to maintain complete buoyancy will be recorded. The EchoMRI, grip 
strength meter and beaker/weight will be sterilized prior to use to ensure that germ -free conditions at the HDDC 
are maintained. Because [CONTACT_630103]  has previously measured lean mass and physical function in mice[42, 43], 
he will perform these measur ements at the HDDC.  
 
Differences for the change in lean mass and physical function will be calculated relative to initial values. 
Statistical significance for the change in lean mass and physical function will be compared in mice colonized with 
fecal bacte ria from HF or LF human donors and for germ -free mice that were not colonized with human gut 
bacteria with use of two -way ANOVA[38]. 
 
III.2.c Bacterial taxa identification and association with the change in lean mass and physical f unction in 
mice colonized with human gut bacteria: Fecal pellets will be obtained from [ADDRESS_840414] -colonization with human gut bacteria, fecal 
pellets will be collected from 60 mice (30 each from the HF and LF donors) and from the 5 germ -free mice that 
did not receive human gut bacteria. 16S rRNA gene profiling on these 70 fecal pellets will be performed as 
described in  Section III.1.a.  
 
Associations between gut bacteria -containing principal components and individual bacterial taxa with the 35 -day 
change in lean mass, mouse grip strength and endurance capacity will be identified as described in Section  III.1.b. 
Supervised machine learning (random forest) will be used to predict whether a sample came from a mouse 
colonized with HF or LF donor microbiota[44].  
 
The gut bacterial profile t hat is associated with the change in lean mass and physical function in mice colonized 
with HF or LF human fecal bacteria is expected to be similar to the gut bacterial profile that is associated with 
differentiation of HF from LF older adults. CIA will be  used to identify associations between circulating 
metabolites with gut bacteria that collectively differentiate mice colonized with HF or LF gut bacteria.

c) Withdrawal/Termination criteria:  Subjects may stop participating in this study at any time for any 
reason. If an enrolled subject decides to withdraw  from this research study, they will be asked to inform 
the Principal Investigator  ([CONTACT_630103] ), the Lab Director ( [CONTACT_630104]), or his 
representative. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_630056]’ s permission for any of the following reasons:  
 The participant did  not adhere to any or all HNRCA volunteer rules and regulations  
 Participant does not follow the study procedures  
 There has been a change in the subject’s health that would make the subject ineligible  
 
B. Risk/benefit assessment : 
Following an overnight 12-hour fast (beginning between 8PM -12AM the day before) , study subjects will provide 
a blood and stool sample , and will have their lean mass measure d. Subjects will then be provided breakfast . Study 
subjects will complete two [ADDRESS_840415], subjects will perform  physical 
function testing . Prior to the baseline and 1 -month study visits , all subjects will be instructed to refrain from any 
strenuous exercise or physical activity for 48 hours prior to the start of the study protocol.   
 
1) Physical risk : 
a. Fasting:  After an overnight fast , you will be asked to provide a blood sample . Fasting is optional for 
the provision of the  stool sample. Risks associated with overnight fasting may include fainting and 
dizziness.  
 
b. Blood draw : There may be a slight discomfort during blood drawing and there is the possibility of a 
small bruise forming at the puncture site. There is also the remote possibility of a superficial 
inflammation (phlebitis) of the vein.  
 
c. Stool collection : There are no risks to this procedure . 
 
d. Measurement of Dietary Intake : There are no risks to this procedure.  
 
e. Memory test (MMSE) : You may become frustrated from the memory test.  
 
f. Measurement of lean mass : Total body lean mass will be measured by [CONTACT_11323] X -ray 
absorptiometry (DXA). Each DXA scan causes a whole -body exposure that is equivalent to 1.5 days 
of natural background radiation exposure. This is generally regarded as safe.  
 
g. Physical function testing : The risk of injury from supervised physical function  testing  is very rare . 
Subjects will have direct supervision during all activities. There is the possibility of transient muscle 
discomfort resulting from the 1RM testing . There is also a small chance that the participant may have 
[ADDRESS_840416] been submitted with this protocol and 
briefly explained in section E.2  under “Adequacy of Protection Against Risk”. The participant will be 
assured that they may stop the session at any time, at which point the physical function assessment  
will be terminated.  
 
a. Psychological risk : N/A  
 
b. Social risk : N/A  
 
c. Economic risk : N/A  
 
d. Benefits of participating in the study:  There are no direct benefits to the volunteers of this study.  
However, they may be helpi[INVESTIGATOR_630057] a potentially improved understanding of 
the role of gut bacteria on mechanisms that may underlie the maintenance of lean mass and  physical 
function in older adults.  
 
C. Specific methods and techniques used throughout the study :  
1. Study Procedures :  
i) Health status : Each subject will complete a screening history review and medical history questionnaire 
during study screening.   
 
ii) Cognitive  function : Cognitive function will be assessed using the mini –ment al state examination 
(MMSE)[45] during the screening period. If your MMSE score is less than 23, the principal investigator 
([CONTACT_630103] ) will inform you that you are not eligible for the study . It is then recommended that 
you discuss your MMSE score with your  primary care physician.   
 
iii) Anthropometric Data:  Height and weight will be measured at the preadmission screening visit, and at 
baseline and [ADDRESS_840417] 0.1 
kg. 
 
iv) Blood draw : At baseline and 1 -month follow -up study visits , fasting blood samples (40mL) will be 
obtained from all subjects . Serum will be derived from whol e blood via centrifugation, and frozen in 
250 uL aliquots until used for serum metabolomics , and for measurement of circulating markers of 
insulin resistance (glucose, insulin) and metabolic endotoxemia (LPS) . Serum  metabolomics will be 
performed by [CONTACT_630086] . A 20 mL portion of each sample will also be 
saved for future exploratory analyses, which may include additional metabolomic profiling.  Consent 
for tissue storage will be obtained t hrough a separate consent form.  Subjects who init ially consent to 
tissue banking  but later decide to withdraw their blood samples from storage and future use may sign 
and return a section of the consent form pertaining to this or verbally notify the Princip al Investigator 
or study coordinator at any time . For subjects that  decline participation in the optional tissue banking 
process, a total of 20 mL of blood will be collected.  
 
v) Stool Collection : Stool samples will be obtained at the baseline and 1 -month stu dy visits. Stool 
samples will be collected (see Supplementary documents) and stored as specified in the Manual of 
Procedures by [CONTACT_630087][46]. Freshly obtained stool samples will be transported 
to the Phoenix L aboratory at Tufts Medical Center , where the stool samples  will be homogenized, 
aliquotted into ten 200mg lots into pyrogen -free Eppendorf tubes , and  frozen at -80°C . Five additional 
200 mg aliquots will also be saved for future exploratory analyses, which  may include additional gut 
bacterial profiling.  Consent for tissue storage will be obtained t hrough a separate consent form.  
Subjects who init ially consent to tissue banking  but later decide to withdraw their stool  samples from 
8 
 storage and future use may sign and return a section of the consent form pertaining to this or verbally 
notify the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_630058] . 
 
vi)  DXA: Total body lean mass will be measured at baseline and 1 -month follow -up visits using DXA 
(Discovery A, Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA) at the [LOCATION_011] Nutrition Obesity Research Center Body 
Composition Unit at Tufts University . The DXA system generates photons at two principal energy 
levels (40 and 70 KeV) which allow measurement of  bone mineral and soft tissue. Lower extremity 
skeletal muscle mass will be estimated using the DEXA -SM model developed by [CONTACT_38874] . 
(1999)[47]. The reliability of this method for  estimating regional skeletal muscle mass is high (C.V. < 
4%).   
 
vii) Measurement of Dietary Intake : If you are enrolled into the study you will complete [ADDRESS_840418] -assisted, 
24-hour dietary recalls. A member of the Tufts University Dietary Assessment Unit will provide 
instructions and a log , and will ask you to write down eve rything you eat and drink over the 24-hr 
period during the 2 days prior to your baseline visit. The final dietary recall will be completed in -
person at the baseline visit, for a total of three 24 -hour dietary recalls. You will be given a two -
dimensional me asuring aid (Food Amounts Booklet) to assist with estimating portion size. A member 
of the Dietary Assessment Unit will complete dietary recalls by [CONTACT_630088], and including on the day of your baseline visit.  
 
viii) Short Physical P erformance Battery  (SPPB) : Study subjects will have their  SPPB measured at the 
screening visit, and at baseline and 1 -month study visits by a NEPS lab study coordinator ( i.e. Brittany 
Barrett ). The SPPB test consists of timed standing balance, gait speed, a nd timed chair -rise 
assessments[1]. Performance for each of these tasks is scored between 0 and 4, with a summary score 
of 0–12. 
 
ix) Four hundred -meter (m) walk  (400-m): Study subjects will have their  400-m measured at baseline and 
1-month study visits by a NEPS lab study coordinator ( i.e. Brittany Barrett ). Study participants will 
walk [ADDRESS_840419] intervals will be permitted while standing,  for 
up to 60 seconds. Gait speed will be calculated from the time and distance c ompleted for each 
participant.  
 
h) Lower extremity 1RM muscle strength  (LP 1 RM) : Study subjects will have their  lower extremity 1RM 
muscle strength  measured (K400, Keiser Sports Health Equipment Inc., Fresno, CA ) at baseline and 
1-month study visits by a NEPS lab study coordinator ( i.e. Brittany Barrett ). The 1RM is defined as 
the maximum load that can be moved one time only throughout the full range of motion (ROM ) while 
maintaining proper form[48]. The examiner will progressively increase  the resistance for each repetition 
until the subject can no longer move the lever arm one time through the f ull ROM[49]. To account for 
the strong correlation between the LP 1 RM  with total lean mass, the LP 1 RM will be  divided by [CONTACT_630089] (LP/Lean) to determine muscle quality[50].

time of continuing review  or study closure if this occurs before the next continuing review . 
 
3. The study physician will act as the medical monitor throughout this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Due to the limited sample 
size and m inimally  invas ive procedures that will be utilized during this investigation, a data safety 
monitoring board will not be used for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   
 
4. The Principal Investigator  ([CONTACT_630103] ) in consultation with the stu dy physician will classify the 
relationship of the SAE/AE to the study protocol as follows:  
 
 Not Related : The event is clearly related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state, not to 
interventions ass ociated with the study protocol  
 
 Remote : The event is most likely related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state, not to 
interventions ass ociated with the study protocol  
 
 Possible : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from interventions associated with the 
study protocol, but is possibly related to such factors as the subject’ s clinical state  
 
 Probable : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from interventions associated with the 
study protocol and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_274534]’s clinical state  
 
 Highly Probable : The event follows a reas onable sequence from interventions associated with the 
study protocol and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_274534]’s clinical state  
 
Potential AEs for study related activities and interventions will be explained to each participant by [CONTACT_630090]. Each participant will be instructed to report the 
occurrence of an AE or SAE at scheduled data collection times. Participants also have access to study 
personnel at other times to report SAEs or concerns about the safety of participating in this study.  
 
Participation in this  study is completely voluntary.  Participants may elect to withdraw from this investigation 
at any time without penalty or coercion, or without any requirement that they provide  an explanation of their 
decision to withdraw.   
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_630060]’s participation in this study for any reason, 
including but not limited to: participant not following study procedures , or a change in th e participant’s health.  
 
At the discretion of the study physician , stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_630061] “probable” or “highly probable” , as related  to the study participation .     
 
[ADDRESS_840422] Participation  
1) Recruitment and consent process : Subjec ts who are  in the Recruitment Database for the Nutrition, Exercise 
Physiology, and Sarcopenia Laboratory (IRB#[ZIP_CODE]) will be utilized to recruit for this study. Subjects  that 
meet the age inclus ion criteria will be sent a direct mailing letter  and contact[CONTACT_630091] . We will also 
contact [CONTACT_630092]. Subjects 
will be recruited as part of health promotion program of municipals, day -care service units, and university. 
The participants wi ll be recruited through local advertisements, flyers, and recommendation by [CONTACT_215798] -givers of 
social intuitions . Participants will be either free -living or assisted living elderly. Our laboratory has been 
successful in recruiting older adults for a large numb er of research studies using similar enrollment cri teria 
and screening procedures. No individuals will be excluded from participation in the study due to racial or 
ethnic origin.  Employees of Tufts University and the HNRCA will not be specifically recruite d. However, 
employees who respond to general advertisements may be enrolled, as long as they are not employees under 
the supervision of the investigators. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_630062] a prescreening telephone questionnaire. If a potential subject meets the inclusion 
criteria and is interested in participating, he/she will be invited to our laboratory for an initial evaluation. A 
preadmission screening informed consent will be obt ained pri or to an initial physical exam.  Study staff will 
interview the subject, review the study, including  inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the individ ual is eligible to 
participate  they will informed by t elephone, and will be asked to meet with the Prin cipal Investigator ( [CONTACT_630105] ) or Study Coordinator ( Brittany Barrett ) at the initial stud y visit to review and sign the study 
informed consent document. Subjects will be given as much time as they require to review all study documents 
and to ask ques tions about the study. The subject will then be asked to summarize the study back to the Study 
Coordinator to confirm their understanding. Subjects will be reminded that they do not have to sign the consent 
form or take part in the study and can leave the study anytime, even after signing the consent form. Subjects 
will designate their consent through signing an IRB approved study consent form. NEPS laboratory study 
coordinators have been trained in the procedures needed to obtain informed consent and to perform study 
assessments by [CONTACT_079]. The Study Coordinators have extensive experience in a variety of 
studies in older adult s in obtaining informed consent and performing the study procedures that are proposed 
in the current project.

Study Telephone Number:   (617) [ADDRESS_840434] how you are treated at Tufts 
Medical Center at Tufts University or the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition 
Research Center on A ging (HNRCA) at Tufts University.  
 
[ADDRESS_840435] (IRB) at (617) [ADDRESS_840436] muscle function. Older adults that are different in terms of how much 
lean mass and in their physical function are specifically recruited for this 
study.  
 
Results from this study are intended as the basis for future s tudies aimed at 
alteration of intestinal bacterial composition, an approach that may be a 
means for improving muscle mass and physical  function in older adults.  
 
Up to 150  subjects will be enrolled in this study at the HNRCA. This study is 
supported by a g rant from the Jean Mayer Human Nutrition Research Center 
on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University.  
 
PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED/STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Height and weight will be measured, blood will be drawn, stool collected, your 
dietary intake will be recorded, and total body lean mass and physical function 
will be measured in eligible participants at the HNRCA’s Nutrition, Exercise 
Physiology, and Sarcopenia (NEPS) Laboratory. These assessments will be 
performed at the baseline and 1 -month follow -up visits. The actual 
procedures are explained below : 
 
Anthropometric Data:  Height will be measured in duplicate to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_840437] 0.1 kg.  
 
Blood Draw  
To perform the blood draw, you will be asked to not eat or drink anything 
(except water) on the previous evening between  8-12 PM onwards. At 
baseline and 1 -month follow -up study visits, fasting blood samples (40mL) 
will be obtained. Serum will be derived f rom whole blood and frozen until used 
to measure: the amount and different types of chemicals present in your 
blood,  markers of your ability to process blood sugar (glucose, insulin), and a 
marker of bacteria that is present in your blood, LPS). A [ADDRESS_840438] your blood samp les stored for potential 
future use, a total of 20 mL of blood will be collected.  
 
Stool Collection  
A stool collection kit (see Supplementary documents)  will be provided to you, 
should you qualify, after the screening visit. You may provide a stool sample 
during the [ADDRESS_840439] any intestinal bacteria (germ -free mice). A separate consent 
form about sample storage will ask you permission to allow us to keep some  
of your feces to perform potential future analyses.  You do not have to sign 
this separate consent for tissue banking to participate in this main study.  
 
Please note that you may choose to have blood and stool samples taken but 
not stored for future unspec ified tests.   
 
Measurement of Dietary Intake  
If you are enrolled into the study you will complete three  24-hour dietary 
recalls. A member of the Tufts University Dietary Assessment Unit will provide 
instructions and a log , and will ask you to write down everything you eat and 
drink over a 24 -hr period during the 2 days prior to your baseline visit. The 
final dietary recall will be completed in -person at the baseline  visit. You will 
be given a two -dimensional measuring aid (Food Amounts Booklet) to assist 
with estimating portion size. A member of the Dietary Assessment Unit will 
21 
 complete dietary recalls by [CONTACT_630097], and 
including on the day of your baseline visit.  
 
Lean mass measurement  
Total body lean mass will be measured at  baseline and 1 -month follow -up 
visits using DXA (Discovery A, Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA) at the [LOCATION_011] 
Nutrition Obesity Research Center Body Composition Unit at Tufts University. 
Each DXA scan causes a whole -body exposure that is equivalent to 1.5 days 
of natural background radiation exposure. This is generally regarded as safe. 
You cannot eat or drink before this assessment. It will be taken early in the 
morning. You will be asked to not eat or drink anything (except water) the 
previous evening from [ADDRESS_840440] from the research team . This person will ensure that the 
proper form and degree of difficulty are maintained.  
 
1. Short Physical Performance Battery  (SPPB): The SPPB test consists of 
timed standing balance, measurement of your speed in completing a timed 
walk, and timed chair -rise assessments. Study subjects will have their 
SPPB measured at baseline and [ADDRESS_840441] ( i.e. NEPS lab study coordinators. These coordinators have 
extensive experience in conducting these tests in older adults.  
 
2. Four hundred -meter (m) walk  (400-m): Study subjects will have their [ADDRESS_840442] intervals will be permitted while standing, for up to 60 
seconds. Gait speed will be calculated from the time and distance 
comp leted for each participant.  
 
3. Lower extremity 1RM muscle strength (LP 1 RM) : Study subjects will have 
their lower extremity 1RM muscle strength measured ( K400, Keiser Sports 
Health Equipment Inc., Fresno, CA) at baseline and [ADDRESS_840443] ( i.e. NEPS lab study coordinators). The 
1RM is defined as the maximum load that can be moved one time only 
22 
 throughout the full range of motion (ROM) while maintaining proper form.  
This test will determine the heaviest weight you can lift through a full range

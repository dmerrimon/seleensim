1.Statement  of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.
The first phase  of this study was performed  at the Medical  University of South Carolina (MUSC) and 
established the feasibility of monitoring physical activity in patients  with  advanced  stage lung cancer via a FitBit® 
(San Francisco,  CA) accelerometer  for one week.[ADDRESS_424961], we will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a low-intensity,  patient- 
centered activity  regimen (PCAR) that prioritizes education and communication over a 12-week period in 
advanced stage lung cancer patients. Our primary outcomes will include  number of patients increasing their 
overall step  count over  the study period and adherence to step  count recommendations. Secondary  outcomes  
will include quality  of life (QoL), dyspnea, and depression scores  before  and after the intervention as well as a 
patient feedback  questionnaire (to guide further  interventions). There will also be a blood draw before  and after 
the intervention  to analyze biomarkers related to lung cancer.  Our goals are to increase  overall step count and 
obtain adherence of >50%.
2.Probable Duration  of Project: State the expected duration of the project,  including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.
We estimate the project’s duration at 16 months. At MUSC, n=[ADDRESS_424962]  
2016 and May 2017  (10 months). Using the same rate of enrollment, with 2 sites we estimate  enrolling 3 
patients/month. We estimate ~[ADDRESS_424963] added an additional 3 
months to ensure  all data is collected and to perform data  analysis.
3.Background: Describe  the background information  that led to the plan for this project.  Provide  references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Background:
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_343260], lung cancer remains  second in cancer frequency and first in 
cancer mortality.[ADDRESS_424964] burdensome cancers, with patients having more  symptoms, lower 
activity, and worsened QoL than their  healthy  counterparts.3 As might be expected, patients’ symptoms and 
activity levels  worsen with time and treatment.4 The pattern  of symptom progression  is consistent with the 
concept of the “dyspnea spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585]” in patients with chronic lung disease, wherein dyspnea develops, activity is 
avoided, functional capacity is lost,  and dyspnea  worsens.  A recent review showed that physical activity studies 
in lung cancer patients are limited but overall suggest benefit.[ADDRESS_424965],6 and a recent retrospective study  of 
lung cancer  survivors showed that approximately  80% of patients requesting exercise recommendations would 
prefer walking.[ADDRESS_424966] accepted exercise adherence of 50-70%.10,11 Interestingly, clinicians 
treating chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD) are using  pedometers to predict exacerbations,[ADDRESS_424967]  
clinical outcomes,13 and assess changes in QoL.14,15 Accelerometer use in patients with lung cancer is
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/6/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/6/2020Page [ADDRESS_424968] physical activity, and has 
the potential to improve adherence to physical  activity recommendations. In summary,  lung  cancer patients are 
interested in exercise though research and clinical application are infrequent. If a clinically practical regimen  
that improves activity adherence can be identified, clinical  benefit in lung cancer is likely. Step counting with 
digital monitoring and tailored messaging may achieve this goal.
Significance:
Since lung cancer patients with advanced stage disease have higher symptom burden  and more activity 
impairment, this population may obtain more benefit from increased physical activity than patients with early 
stage disease.  However, little data is available  regarding physical activity  or the clinical  utility  of using 
accelerometers with an exercise prescription in patients  with advanced stage  lung  cancer. Success of this study 
would establish a real-world, implementable,  low-impact activity  regimen  that improves QoL in lung cancer 
patients.
Preliminary Studies:
Our phase I study collected  data for [ADDRESS_424969]  patients were interested in 
participating in the physical activity study  and strongly  positive Spearman Rank correlation between step count  
and overall  QoL (ρ=0.46), physical  functioning  (ρ=0.61),  and emotional  functioning (ρ=0.40) as well negative 
correlation between step count and depression (ρ =-0.40), dyspnea (ρ=-0.54), and pain  (ρ=-0.37) were noted. 
Patients with  higher  step  counts  had higher QoL scores and lower symptom and depression  scores  (see Figures 
1, 2, and 3).
Without changing our design, we collected 4 weeks of step count data  in 29 patients using an escalating 
regimen (see activity  regimen below).  Communication with  subjects during the 4-week period  was inconsistent.  
In this cohort,  21% (6/29)  of patients did not use the device.  Of those who used the device 61% (14/23) 
increased their  weekly step  count at some point  during the 4 week period, though  weekly  prescriptions were 
followed in <50%  of cases (unpublished). Patient  participation during this 4-week  period may have been  too low 
to have  a therapeutic benefit.  To improve patient participation  and adherence to activity prescriptions, we will
(1) provide an educational session at enrollment,  (2) increase subject communication via tailored electronic 
messaging, and (3) utilize a wrist-bound device (FitBit Flex 2) rather than one clippi[INVESTIGATOR_343261] (FitBit Zip).
4.Research Plan: Summarize the study  design and research  procedures  using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood  by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits  specifying  their individual  times  and 
lengths.  Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
Study Design
Randomized trial enrolling n=40 patients  (Usual care: n=20; Intervention group: n=20).
Randomization: Participants will be randomized into one of 2 study  arms using a random permuted block  design 
of varying block  size in a 1:1 ratio (n=20 to intervention, 20 to usual  care).  Since the study  utilizes text 
messaging as an intervention, blinding  will not be possible.
Definitions
Intervention Group will receive the interventions mentioned above, including an educational session at 
enrollment, tailored electronic messaging with walking goals, and a wrist-bound accelerometer.
Usual care group  will receive standard of care management from their  Oncologist.

number of “usable”  weeks). As per the literature,  a week is considered “usable” if 5/7 days of step  counts  are 
available, and days  with  <200 steps/day are considered not usable. Thus, not all weeks will have enough data  to 
provide an appropriate average daily step count nor a prescription. Our goal is to obtain >50%  exercise 
adherence.

cancer histology,  disease stage, lung cancer treatment  history, medical comorbidities (i.e.,  COPD,  depression, 
and anxiety),  treatment of medical  comorbidities, smoking status, and performance status.  This information 
may help in predicting  who is more likely to participate in/benefit from increasing  physical  activity.
Surveys
Once consenting to participation, subjects will complete 4 voluntary, self-administered, validated
surveys the same day after signing consent and at the end of their 12 week study duration : (1) Patient  Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), (2) Quality of Life Questionnaire  (QLQ-C30, Version 3), (3) Modified Medical Research  
Council (MMRC)  Dyspnea Scale, (4) the Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ). Study staff will explain  the 
purpose of each survey, and subjects will complete the surveys in a private exam room. Study staff will be 
available to assist in survey completion, if needed.
Randomization will be performed via an envelope  system. Prior  to beginning the study,  40 envelopes 
indicating Intervention or Usual  care  group  will be created and sealed  using the randomization  schema 
described above. After  consenting to the study, the envelope corresponding to the patient’s enrollment number  
will be opened.
At the end of the intervention, the PHQ-9, QLQ-C30, MMRC, and PAQ will be re-administered. In 
addition, a 10-item  Feedback Survey  in order to guide future  studies. Participants may fill out the follow-up 
surveys at their regularly-scheduled  appointments, via questionnaires mailed to the patient with  a self-  
addressed envelope to return, or by [CONTACT_343269].  Study staff will try to obtain  the final 
questionnaires within [ADDRESS_424973] in 
setting up their personal account. Those  subjects in the usual care group will be provided a FitBit Flex 2 at the 
end of the study, and study staff will offer to help  set up the device.
A total  of 55 patients will be enrolled between Yale University,  and the Medical University of South 
Carolina (MUSC).  Those  who agree to participate will be given  a unique patient Study ID which will be used to 
identify completed surveys. De-identified survey  data  will be entered into the REDCap™ study database.
This study  will be performed  at both  MUSC and Yale University, and de-identified data from both  
institutions will be stored on REDCap servers maintained  by [CONTACT_293709]. At the end of the study, data  will be 
pooled for analysis.  Since dates of treatment will be collected  for the study,  a shared data use agreement between 
Yale University  and MUSC  is in place.
Biomarkers
Fasting blood  (> 12 hours) will be collected at baseline and at 12 weeks. Two 10-ml  red-top tubes  will be 
collected for serum, one 10-ml  lavender-top  tube will be collected for EDTA  plasma,  and two 4.5-ml light blue- top 
tubes will be collected  for citrate  plasma (total volume 39 mL of blood at each visit). Technicians will centrifuge 
the EDTA  samples  at 2,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C within 1 hour of collection. Plasma and buffy coat will be 
separated, and, along with the serum, will be transferred into cryovials and labeled with freezer-proof  labels with 
participant ID #s and date. All specimens will be stored temporarily at -20°C after aliquotting  prior to delivery to 
the YCCI freezer  (within 2 hours), and then stored at -[ADDRESS_424974]’s baseline and 
follow-up samples will be assayed in the same batch, and an equal number  of intervention and control samples 
also will be included  in each  batch.  Appropriate blinded quality control samples (low  and high levels) will be used

using kits from Life Technologies Inc, Carlsbad, CA: Leptin (KAC2281), soluble PD-1 (BMS2214), soluble  PD-L1 
(BMW2212), and CRP (KHA0031).
Subjects will be invited to allow blood samples  (specimens)  to be stored for future use regarding  biomarker  testing 
associated with lung  cancer.  Genetic  testing  will not be performed in this study. The storage and future testing of the 
blood samples is described in the consent, and subjects  will have  the option to decline  future  use of the sample  as well as 
being contact[CONTACT_343270].  If the subject declines future  use of the samples, the specimen  will be destroyed after  
this study  is completed. If the subject changes  their mind,  samples  will not be destroyed  but the code connecting  your 
identifiers to the samples will be deleted so your samples will then be anonymous.
Educational Session
Study staff will provide a brief  educational  session guided by [CONTACT_343271]. Study staff will also discuss use of the FitBit device, the smartphone application, 
and methods  by [CONTACT_343272] (i.e., text messaging, e-mail, or telephone). Any subject 
questions will be answered.
Activity Monitoring and messaging
We will provide  the subject with a FitBit Flex®,  and ask him/her to wear it every day for [ADDRESS_424975] that it is charged it every 3-4 days (or when the battery is low). We will download  the 
FitBit® application to the subject’s  smartphone and set up a generic email account and sign-in to

questions or problems.
Step counts are recorded in and collected from the FitBit  website. Since an e-mail  address  is required 
for a FitBit  account,  a unique  Yale e-mail address will be created (i.e., xlungc.#@yale.edu). This e-mail  address 
will be used  to activate  the FitBit account but will not include patient information.
Patients will be asked to wear the FitBit Flex device  every day and night for 12 weeks excepting  when  
the device  needs to be charged and when the device  may get wet (e.g., bathing  or swimming).
The first 7 days of step count monitoring  will be used to establish an average daily step count. After  7 
days, participants  will be instructed to increase their daily  step  count by 400 steps/day from their average daily  
step count  and will maintain  this daily  goal for one week.  For example, if a patient has an average baseline of 
[ADDRESS_424977] 7 days,  their goal will be to increase their  step  count to 8400  steps/day for the 
next 7 days  (2nd week).  This cycle  will be continued weekly  for a total  of 12 weeks. If the patient reaches  an 
average of >10,000 steps/day, instructions will be to maintain their current activity level.
The subjects’  progress and step count goals will be relayed via twice/daily via smartphone  text 
messaging. The text message application is secure, password-protected, and HIPAA-compliant.  Text  messages 
have been developed  and will be the same for each patient  (excepting  replacement messages that will be sent  
when step  counts are not collected,  see below). Messages  will include  the subject’s name, their most recent 
step count, their current step count  goal, a motivational statement, reminders to wear and charge the device, 
and gain-framed messages.  Gain-framed  messages  emphasize  the benefits  of a certain  behavior19 and have 
been shown  to increase activity in older men,20 healthy women,21 and overweight  patients.22 An example text 
for [CONTACT_343295]:  “John, last week was great! Your  average was 5000 steps. Today, we'd like you to walk  5400  
steps. Good luck!”
Three separate messages may replace  the regularly-scheduled message if step counts are declining  or 
not collected:
If step  counts are declining, the following text message may be used  once, “[CONTACT_343296], your step  
counts are lower. Daily  walking will improve your energy level!  Call us with  problems.”
If a step count is not collected for 1 day, the following text message will be used once, “John,  
your step counts are low.  Please  wear  and sync  the FitBit. Walking  improves fatigue. Call with 
questions.”
If a week is “unusable” per study definitions, the following text message will be used  once, 
“John, we missed steps for [ADDRESS_424978] week; too few to average. Please wear the FitBit  every 
day; try for (average+400)!
If no step  counts are recorded for 2 or more  days,  the study team  will call the patient to evaluate  for 
difficulty with  the FitBit  device. If difficulty with the device is discovered, a member of the study team will 
arrange to meet the patient at a regularly-scheduled clinic  visit.
Due to patient  feedback  during the initial part of the study, if a patient has “0” steps recorded, the line 
referencing how many  steps were taken will be deleted  from the text message. Specifically,  we will not send  
text messages  saying, “John, you walked 0 steps  today.”

personal accounts in both the intervention and usual care groups. De-identified  activity data  from will be 
added to the REDCap™ study database. Recorded step counts  will be rounded  to the nearest whole number.
Sleep Monitoring

and poor  sleep  quality is associated  with lower QoL,24 total  sleep time and the number  of awakenings will be 
collected. Collection  of nightly  sleep time and number of awakenings will not influence the specific aims of this 
study but may guide future studies.  Sleep data will also be recorded  in the REDCap™ study database. Recorded  
values will be rounded to the nearest  whole number.

shortness of breath,  chest pain, falls, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) will be reported to the Institutional Review Board  in 
addition to being discussed with the treating oncologist. Outside participating institutions  will immediately 
report SAEs to the Yale Lead  Investigator. Adverse events that are unexpected, related or possibly related, but 
not serious  will also be reported to the IRB to ensure the process is safe.
ii.What  provisions are in place for management of interim  results?
An interim  analysis evaluating study acceptability  to patients  and comparing patient participation to our 
prior work  (using weekly phone calls)  has been  performed. No further analysis is planned until the study is 
completed.
iii.What will the multi-site process be for protocol modifications?
If protocol  modifications are necessary, both Yale University and MUSC investigators  will agree to the 
protocol modifications, and IRB approvals  will be obtained at both  sites.
13.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical  analyses that support the study design.
Data Analysis
This portion  of the study is to focus on feasibility of increasing physical activity via an exercise regimen 
and adherence  with study recommendations. As a feasibility  study, we will aim to enroll n=55 subjects. Simple 
descriptive statistics  (e.g. percentages, confidence intervals, means, medians, etc.) will be utilized  where 
necessary and calculated using SAS v9.3.  Exploratory  analyses  will involve measuring associations  (i.e. Spearman 
rank correlations) between activity measurements  and changes in survey domain scores.
Primary study  endpoints  will include  the following: (1) overall number  and percentage  of patients 
increasing their average  daily step counts over  84 days and (2) adherence with  study recommendations. 
Adherence will be defined as (the number of weeks a patient  achieved the recommended  walking goal)/(the 
number of recommendations  made).  Other endpoints  will include  biomarkers in blood (C-reactive protein, 
leptin, insulin,  PD-1, and PD-L1),  survey-specific domain scores  (e.g. QLQ-C30 physical functioning, bodily  pain, 
etc.), changes in those domain scores after  the 84-day period, and analysis of feedback questionnaires (using 
simple statistics).
Within this phase,  statistical analyses will involve the use of Spearman correlations  to assess the extent  
to which changes in step counts over time are associated with  changes in health related QoL domain scores.
Since step counts will be measured daily, we will also construct generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs)  to 
assess these relationships.  The GLMMs  will allow us to account for the fact that step  counts  will likely be 
correlated within individuals over time. If sleep time and number of awakenings can be collected,  Spearman 
correlations will also be calculated for step counts and survey-specific  domain scores.
Sample size justification
We will calculate  the proportion of patients who are willing to wear and utilize  the Fitbit® Flex™ 
pedometer. Based on prior studies  in healthy patients, we anticipate that consent to participation and 
compliance with the device can reach  70-80%.26 Our adherence will surely  be lower due to enrolling patients 
with lung  cancer. With  n=50 subjects participating in activity  monitoring and survey collection, estimates of 
adherence and survey domain scores will be sufficiently precise. For example, should 40 of the 50 subjects be 
fully compliant, the 95% confidence interval for that compliance  rate will range from 66% to 90%, providing

Does the Investigator or any member of the research team have a direct existing clinical relationship  with any 
potential subject?
☐Yes, all subjects
☒Yes, some of the subjects
☐No
If yes, describe the nature of this relationship.
There are no clinical current relationships. Since  [CONTACT_343297] works in the Thoracic Oncology  clinic, it is 
possible that would see enrolled subjects or those  eligible for enrollment in his clinic. If [CONTACT_343297] sees patients in 
both a clinical and research  capacity, the roles will be clearly  distinguished during the clinic visit.
5.Request for waiver  of HIPAA authorization: (When  requesting a waiver of HIPAA Authorization for either  the 
entire study, or for recruitment  purposes  only. Note: if you are collecting PHI as part of a phone or email  
screen, you must  request  a HIPAA  waiver for recruitment purposes.)
Choose one:
☐For entire  study

6.Process of Consent/Assent: Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will be obtained, 
including parental permission  or surrogate permission  and the steps taken to ensure  subjects’ independent 
decision-making.
Subjects will be recruited in person at the Smilow Cancer  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343264]. Study 
investigators and study staff will inform the treating  clinician  of potential participation in the study, and patients  
will be approached while they are waiting for their  standard of care  visit or immediately after the visit. Study 
staff will explain  the following:  goals  of the study,  groups in the study (i.e., intervention group  and usual  care  
group), length of the study, anticipated risk/benefits of study involvement, measures taken to minimize  risk, and 
requirements for participating in the study (i.e., need for a smartphone,  willingness  to download a FitBit 
application to the smartphone, willingness to wear an accelerometer  for 12 weeks,  and willingness  to receive 2 
text messages/day for 12 weeks).  The patient will be given the opportunity  to ask questions.   Study staff will 
also explain  that participation is voluntary, and any participant may choose to stop participating in the study at 
any time.  Study staff will also explain that participation (or non-participation) in the study will not influence 
their clinical  care. Documents  provided to the patient will include  an informational handout, an educational 
pamphlet, HIPAA authorization,  and the consent form. If patients volunteer to participate, copi[INVESTIGATOR_343265].
7.Evaluation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide  Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel obtaining 
consent will assess the potential subject’s  ability  and capacity to consent to the research being  proposed.
A subject’s appropriateness  for study participation and capacity to provide  informed  consent  will be 
assessed in [ADDRESS_424987] will be approached  to 
confirm the patient’s appropriateness  for the study. If the study  staff member  who is recruiting  the patient is 
concerned about  patient appropriateness for the study or understanding of the study/consent process, study 
staff will notify  to the treating oncologist and Primary Investigator to discuss their concerns. Ultimately, the 
primary investigator and treating  oncologist must  agree to the patient’s inclusion  in the study. If either the 
oncologist or Primary  Investigator have  concerns regarding the patient’s capacity or appropriateness  for the 
study, the patient will not be enrolled.
8.Non-English  Speaking  Subjects:  Explain  provisions in place to ensure comprehension for research involving  
non-English speaking subjects.  If enrollment of these  subjects is anticipated, translated  copi[INVESTIGATOR_20885].
Since communication between the study  team  and the patient is crucial and translated  materials are not 
currently available, non-English speaking patients will not be enrolled in this study.

1. BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE   
 
1.1. Background  
Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) has become an effective and reliable treatment for arthritis of the knee (1). 
TKA is associated with low morbidity and mortality, and its effectiveness in reducing joint pain and improving range of motion is well established. In 2014, over 750,000 kn ee replacements were performed 
in the US (2).  
 
A significant innovation in TKA has been the introduction of computer navigation and robotic -assisted 
surgery (3). On e such technology is the Navio ™ Robotic -assisted Surgical System.   This system is a semi-
autonomous image -free system. During the surgery, the surgeon maps the condylar landmarks and 
determines alignment indices to define the volume and orientation of bone to be removed. The tools to remove the bone and place the implants are controlled and manip ulated by [CONTACT_370760] a 3 -dimensional digital map of the surgical surface.  
 
Originally the Navio ™ system was launched for use in unicondylar knee replacement only.   To date, there 
have been over 1000 unicondylar knee replacement surgeries using the system.   In 2017, Smith & 
Nephew Inc. expanded the indications for the Navio ™ system to include TKA.   The purpose of this 
multicenter, prospective study is to evaluate outcomes associated with this new indication.  
 
1.2. Study Rationale  
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate superior accuracy with the Navio ™ Robotic -assisted Surgical 
System  in achieving desired post -operative mechanical alignment, compared to TKA procedures using 
standard instruments . An additional study purpose is to document clinical and patient- reported outcomes 
in subjects receiving TKA  with the Navio ™ system.  
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of the use of the Navio™ Robotic -
assisted Surgical System in the implantation of the JOURNEY™ II BCS or CR Systems  in achieving post -
operati ve mechanical alignment within  +3° of target , as compared to TKA procedures using standard 
instruments.  
 
2.2. Secondary Objectives  
Secondary obje ctives of this study include the generation of safety, performance, and health economic 
evidence supporting the use of the Navio ™ Robotic -assisted Surgical System in TKA procedures, per the 
endpoints listed below.

events (SAE), adverse device effects (ADE), serious adverse device effects (SADE), unanticipated serious 
adverse device effects ([LOCATION_003]DE) , and device deficiencies (DevD).  
 
4. STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a multi -center, prospective cohort study with a comparison to  historical control to collect [ADDRESS_463864] completed a  two year visit . 
 
5. STUDY DEVICE 
 The Smith & Nephew Navio  Robotic -assisted Surgical System aids the surgeon in planning and 
executing a procedure involving bone preparation for prosthesis implantation. The system is comprised of computer -assisted surgical instrument control, a commercially available surgical drill, image -free 
navigation, and pl anning software with standard navigation technology.  
 The Navio System uses data gathered during the beginning of the surgical procedure (planning phase) to generate a computer model of the knee surface to be remodeled in preparation for the implant. The software uses data collected during the planning phase along with pre -loaded data describing the 
implant geometry to guide the surgeon in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_370749]. The Navio system software then allows the surgeon to evaluate the range of motion and fit of the implant prior to finalizing 
the procedure.  
 The Navio system software consists of a patient and user management module, a surgical planner, and an intraoperative cutting module. The surgeon uses patient data collected at the surgical site to align the 
implant and shape the target surface of the bone to accept the intended implant. The Navio system also 
uses the tracked position of the surgical bur to control its cutting engagement to the bone that is to receive the implant. This cuttin g control is based on the bur’s proximity to the planned target surface of 
the bone.  
 
                                                
Document date  :19SEP2017 ; Version 2.0 Confidential & Proprietary   Page : 10 of 31 
 
 
The cutting control is achieved in two ways:  
• Exposure control adjusts the bur's exposure with respect to a guard. If the surgeon encroaches on a portion of bone that is n ot to be cut, the Navio system retracts the spi[INVESTIGATOR_370750], disabling cutting. The Navio system software also adjusts the depth of the cut by [CONTACT_370761].  
• Speed control regulates the signal tran smitted to the drill motor. This limits the speed of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_370751]. Bur motion is 
also disabled if the bur is moved outside of expected cutting boundaries.  
 
The surgeon can alternate  between these two cutting control modes. The surgeon can also disable both 
cutting control modes and operate the Navio system as a standard navigated drill.  
 
The Navio system incorporates a detailed user interface that provides procedure setup, tracking s tatus, 
visual indicators, and real -time cutting progress during the procedure.  
 The Navio System is shown below:  
 
The function of each component is as follows:  
• Tracking Camera and Stand - The mobile infrared tracking camera is used to determine the 
position of the point probe and the surgical bur tip and track their movement by [CONTACT_370762]’s femur and tibia.  
• Navio  System Cart - The mobile cart contains the electronic control system, electrical system 
integration unit, computer, and uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Navio system carts are 

 
                                                
Document date  :19SEP2017 ; Version 2.0 Confidential & Proprietary   Page : [ADDRESS_463865], 
Anspach™ drill foot control, and the Navio system foot control. The touchscreen monitor is the 
primary user interface for the Navio system.  
• Anspach™ Drill Foot Control - The Anspach drill foot control is used to control the Anspach drill 
during surgery. The surgeon must press the foot control to activate the bur. The speed of the bur 
is controlled by [CONTACT_370763].  
• Navio System Foot Control - The Navio system foot control is used as an alternative to the 
touchscreen monitor when data points are being collected to define landmarks, shape bone, and 
position the implant prior to surgery.  
• Navio System Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] - The Navio system handpi[INVESTIGATOR_370752]. In 
exposure mode, as the bur nears the target surface of the bone intended to accept the implant, 
the Anspach drill and bur  retracts into the guard to prevent further cutting of bone.  
 
The Navi o system is intended to assist the surgeon in providing software -defined spatial boundaries for 
orientation and reference information to anatomical structures during orthopedic procedures. The system is indicated for use in surgical knee procedures, in whi ch the use of stereotactic surgery may be 
appropriate, and where reference to rigid anatomical bony structures can be determined. These procedures include [LOCATION_006]R and patellofemoral arthroplasty. The Navio System is indicated for use with cemented implants onl y (refer to User Manuals for more detail).  
 
5.1. Surgical Technique  
The Navio System is to be used  per standard of care at the participating study sites. Each participating 
investigator will have performed a minimum of 8 Navio  TKA procedures prior to enrolling subjects on 
this study. The Navio System is indicated for Smith & Nephew cemented Total  Knee implants, but for the 
purposed of this study we are restricting the type of  implant to the Journey II BCS or Cruciate -Retraining  
(CR) Systems  and compatible S&N patellar implants.  The list of acceptable part numbers can be found 
in Appendix [ADDRESS_463866] Screening & Enrollment  
To eliminate the potential for selection bias, Investigators should  screen all subjects undergoing a Navio™ 
assisted TK A.  In order to do so, only the existing information obtained per standard routine medical 
procedures will be used.  No study -specific screening procedures, activities or questionnaires will be 
performed during pre -screening.  
 Once a subject  has completed the informed consent procedure and signed the Informed Consent Form , 
the Principle Investigator (PI) , or delegated study research staff , can complete the screening process with 
the subject . All potential subjects who undergo the screening process will be documented on a Screening 
and Enrollment Log , on which reasons for exclusion from or denial to participate should be noted.   In the 
even t that a subject ha s a bilateral Navio assisted TKA , only the first knee treated after informed consent 
will be enrolled in the study.

A. Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device [ 1]. 
This definition includes : 
• events related to the investigational medical device or the comparator  
• events related to the procedures involved  
 B. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is an adverse event that [ 1]: 
• led to death,  
• led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in : 
1) a life -threatening illness or injury, or  
2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
3) in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
4) medical or surgical i ntervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function  
• led to fetal  distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
 Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760] , without 
serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event . 
 C. Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
An ADE is an adverse event related to the use of  an investigational medical device [ 1]. 
 This definition includes : 
• adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, 
implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device . 
• any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
 
D. Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
An SADE is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a 
serious adverse event [ 1]. 
 E. Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
A serious adverse device effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report  or the clinical investigation plan  [1,2]. 
 F. Device Deficiency  
A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use erro rs, and inadequate 
labelling .  
For the purpose of this study , device deficiencies should be reported when they concern any component 
of the study device or any components of the Journey II implants, as well as its packaging and  tools  that 
need  to be used  during implantation  according to the Instructions for Use.  
  
 
                                                
Document date  :19SEP2017 ; Version 2.0 Confidential & Proprietary   Page : 17 of 31 
 
G. Revisions  
A specially designed Revision  Case Report  Form will be used in addition to the Adverse Event Form,  to 
document in detail revisions  of any of the components of the study device .  
 
9.2. Safety : Investigator’s Responsibilities  
Investigators shall record adverse event s and observed device deficienc ies, together with an assessment  
of seriousness, severity, and relatedness , in the subject’s source data.  Following, Investigators are 
responsible for documenting AEs and device deficiencies on the appropriate CRF and submitting them to 
the Sponsor according to the timelines described here below.  
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the Investigator must seek information o n AEs by [CONTACT_71997], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_370768]. AEs must be recorded in Standard  English medical 
terminology.   
Unresolved AEs should be followed by [CONTACT_370769], the subject is lost to 
follow -up or through to the end of the study, whichever timing occurs first. Unresolved AEs at the end of 
the subject’s participation will be monitored by [CONTACT_370770]’s normal standard of care.  
 The Investigator will categorize AEs as mild, moderate or severe based on the following definitions:  
• Mild: the subject is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated.  T he event is of 
little concern to the subject and/or little clinical significance.  The event is not expected to have any effect on the subject’s overall health or wellbeing.  
• Moderate : the subject has discomfort enough to cause interference with or change i n usual 
activities.  The event is of some concern to the subject’s health or wellbeing and may require medical intervention and/or close follow -up. 
• Severe:  t he adverse event interferes considerably with the subject’s usual activities.  The event 
is of def inite concern to the subject and/or poses substantial risk to the subject’s health or 
wellbeing.  The event is likely to require medical intervention and/or close follow -up and may be 
incapacitating or life threatening.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_370754] b e required.   
 The Investigator is responsible for describing the relationship of the AE to Navio (the study device), the implant and the procedure  based on the following definitions:  
• Unrelated : the event is clearly not related to the study device or proce dure  
• Possible:  the event may or may not be related to the study device or procedure.  A relationship 
cannot be ruled out.  
• Definite:  the event is clearly related to the study device or procedure.  
 
9.3. Timelines for Submission of Safety I nformation : 
The timelines begin when the Investigator becomes aware of the event.  
 The Investigator will report to the Sponsor:
 
• As soon as possible, but no greater than  24 hours   upon becoming aware of the event, 
SAEs*, SADEs , U(S)ADEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE : 
o if suitable action had not been taken  
o if intervention had not been made, or  
o if circumstances had been less fortunate  
Docu
ment date  :19SEP2017 ; Version 2.0 Confidential & Proprietary  Page : 18 o f 31 
•Revisions , within 24 hours  upon becoming aware  of the event . Sponsor will provide an
explant retrieval kit on becoming aware of a revision and ask the Investigator to return any revised
components for retrieval analysis.
Inve
stigators may also be asked to supply the Sponsor, upon Sponsor’s request, with any additional 
information related to the safety reporting of a particular event.  
The Princ
ipal Investigator will be responsible for reporting to the IRB/EC  of the study site and  to the 
regulatory authorities, SAEs , SADEs  and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE , as required by 
[CONTACT_87712].  
9.4. Safety reporting: Sponsor’s Responsibilities  
Sponsor will provide progress reports on safety events to the  Investigator to report to the IRB /EC as 
required.   
In the case of multicenter studies, Sponsor will inform all Investigators in writing of all SAEs that were reported by [CONTACT_370771].  
The Sponsor will also , in case of SADEs and device deficiencies that could have led to SADEs, determine 
whether the risk analysis needs to be updated and assess whether corrective or preventive action is 
required.  
10.STATISTICAL PROCEDURES
10.1. Sample size calculation  
Parratte et al.7 looked at  the effects of p ostoperative mechanical axis alignment on the s urvival of TKAs . 
They found that of the 398 TKAs reviewed in the paper there were 292 (73.4%) which post -operatively 
were defined as mechanically aligned (with a mechanical axis of 0™ ± 3™) . 
This
 study aims to show superiority in the proportion of TK As post -operatively defined as mechanically 
aligned against the reference proportion of 73.4% from above.  
It is e
stimated that the proportion of mechanically aligned TK As using the Navio system will be around 
88%. If this assumption holds then the recruitment of 115 subjects  would  be sufficient to  provide 80% 
power to show that the lower limit of the two -sided  95% confidence interval for the proportion of 
mechanically aligned TK As is greater than 73.4%, hence proving superiority to the reference literature.  
It is expected that approximately 5% of subjects will be lost to follow up at the 1 month visit and therefore 120 subjects will be recruited for this study.  
10.2. General Statistical Considerations  
Smith & Nephew’s Global Biostatistics group will conduct the statistical analy sis for this study and they 
will prepare Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Unless otherwise stated, all significance tests and hypothesis testing will be two- sided, performed at the 5% significance level. Resulting p -values will be quoted and 
95% two -sided confidence intervals will be generated where appropriate. All p -values will be rounded to 
three decimal places, p -values less than 0.001 will be presented as ‘<0.001’ in all tables.  
Where data summaries are specified, categorical and ordinal variables will  be summarized with 
frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables will be summarized with the following summary statistics: number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values. All analyses will be performed in SAS 9.4 (or later).  
Docu
ment date  :19SEP2017 ; Version 2.0 Confidential & Proprietary  Page : [ADDRESS_463873]- to-follow -up, death, revision, and 
withdrawn subjects is to be provided in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). The methods used to handle 
missing or incomplete data for the efficacy and safety measures will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP).  
10.4. Analysis Populations   
All subjects that are operated on by [CONTACT_370772]. The following 
study populations and analysis sets will be defined:  
•Safety Population : This population will include all subjects that received the study device and will
be used for analysis of demographics, disposition data and safety .
•Modified Intention to Treat  Population (mITT) : Following the intention to treat principle, t his
population  Full Analysis Set (FAS): This will include all subjects that received the study device  and
attended at least one post -baseline assessment. This population will be used for the primary
analysis of all efficacy endpoints.
•Per Protocol Population (PP) : This population will include all subjects that received the study
device, meet the inclusion/exclus ion criteria, attend all follow -up assessments  within the
specified window , and have no significant protocol deviations. Subjects that are required to be
withdrawn from the study under the protocol (e.g. due to revision) will be included regardless ofattendance of follow -up visits unless they are deemed to have significant prot ocol deviations or
failed to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  This population will be used as secondary analysis
of all efficacy endpoints.
10.5. Analys is of Primary Endpoint   
The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects achieving post -operative mechanical 
alignment, defined as ±3o from target , assessed at the [ADDRESS_463874] ed TKA . 
The p
roportion defined above will be presented along with the associated two -sided 95% confidence 
interval, to  be calculated using exact binomial methods.  
Super
iority of the proportion of subjects achieving post -operative mechanical alignment, after  undergoing 
a Navio assisted TKA  against those in the reference literature (Parratte et al.)7 will be achieved if th e lower 
limit of the two -sided 95% confidence interval is greater than 73.4%.  
Mech
anical alignment will also be summarized using summary statistics.  
10.6. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  
Implant survival rate will be assessed  for a final analysi s using the number and proportion of subjects who 
had no implant revisions by [CONTACT_941] 2- year time point, the associated 95% confidence interval s will be 
calculated using exact binomial methods. Time to occurrence of revision s will also be analyzed using 
Kaplan -Meier survi val analysis.  
KSS, EQ -5D-5
L, and FJS scores will be analyzed separately at the end of study using Repeated Measures 
ANOVA  models , prognostic and baseline factors will be adjusted for.

Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], operative time (both skin to skin time and anesthetic time), and radiographic 
assessments  will be assessed using summary statistics.  Trends in operative time measures for individual 
investigators over the course of the study will be assessed.  
10.7. Analysis of Safety  Endpoin ts:  
The safety endpoints for this study are the number of occurrences  and the frequency of subject s 
reporting: adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), adverse device effects (ADE), serious 
adverse device effects (SADE), unanticipated serious adverse device effects ([LOCATION_003]DE) and device deficiencies (DevD).  
In add
ition, for each event, the following will be summarised: seriousness, the relationship to the 
investigational device (Navio), relationship to implant, relationship to study procedure , outc ome and either 
the duration of the resolved events or the duration of the events at study completion.  
11.ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
11.1. Ethical Approval  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and local regulations of the participating countries, sites must gain written IRB/EC  approval prior to enrolling research participants in the study.  
11.2. Protocol Amendments  
Neither the Investigator nor the Sponsor  will modify this protocol without mutual agreement. After 
agreement to initiate the modification - in the form of a protocol amendment  - the Investigator agrees not 
to implement this modification until instructed to do so by [CONTACT_1034].  It will be necessary to obtain IRB/EC  approval prior to implementation of any change in the protocol that may affect th e scientific 
soundness or the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects involved. Notification shall be submitted to the IRB/EC of the study site by [CONTACT_737] .  
11.3. Informed Consent  
All study subjects must sign an IRB/EC approved ICF according to 2011: ISO14155 guidelines , GCP 
guidelines  and all applicable national regulations. Potential subject s must be informed as to the purpose 
of the study and the potential risks and benefits known or that can be reasonably predicted or expected as described in the written consent form. The subject  shall have sufficient opportunity to consider 
participation in the study; a subject  cannot be led to believe that he/she is  waiving his/her  rights as a 
subject or the liability of the Sponsor or Investigator. Subject s are then invited to sign and date the 
consent form, indicating their consent for enrollment.  The Investigator will retain the original copy of the 
signed consent form in the study files. A duplicate copy shall be provided to the subject . 
11.4. Risk – Benefit An alysis  
A. Study R
elated Risks  
Possible risks that may occur as a result of study procedures are:  
•Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires;  however these are not interventional procedures
and are not expected to add significant time to any appointments.
•This study involves the use of x -ray evaluation.  X -ray exposure is cumulative over a lifetime and total
exposure should be kept to a minim um.  However, if the x -ray exposure when participating in the
Docu
ment date  :19SEP2017 ; Version 2.0 Confidential & Proprietary  Page : [ADDRESS_463875] would receive if they chose not  to participat e in the 
study , there is no additional risk associated with this study.  
•As a result of participating in the study there could be a risk of loss of protected subject information
confidentiality.  All applicable confidentiality standards and data protection and privacy laws will be
followed by [CONTACT_370773].  Data will be coded
and handled only by [CONTACT_370774].
Risk
s related to the general surgical procedures are not considered here because these could be present 
regardless of participation into the study.  
B. Study 
Related B enefits  
Because the surgery and all the follow -up visits are the same as if the subject would not participate in this 
study, there are no additional medical benefits associated with participating in this study. The information gained from this stud y may help improve the treatment of people that need to undergo TKA. 
12.MONITORING PROCEDURES

 INTRODUCTION 
Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)/glutamate receptor complex 
antagonist that decreases pain by [CONTACT_776777], hyperalgesia, and “wind-up” 
phenomenon at the level of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (dorsal ganglion) and central nervous system (1). 
Ke
tamine administration in sub-dissociative doses (SDK) of 0.1-0.3 mg/kg in p re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776774]-traumatic 
pain, chronic non-cancer and cancer pain, and in patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-tolerant pain by [CONTACT_776778]-hyperalgesia, anti-allodynia, and anti-tolerance (2-4).Two commonly utilized 
routes of of SDK administration in the ED include an intravenous route (intravenous push dose or 
short infusion) and intranasal route (5 - 11).  
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
In the situation when intravenous access is not readily available or unobtainable, and intranasal 
route is not feasible, another non-invasive route of ketamine administration such as inhalation via 
B
reath-Actuated Nebulizer (BAN) is coming into the play. The BAN allows a controlled patient-
initiated delivery of analgesics in titratable fashion (12). Nebulized administration of ketamine has 
be
en studied in the areas of acute postoperative pain management (post-intubational sore throat), 
in 
anesthesia (pre- medication for general anesthesia,) and in managing cancer pain, and status 
asthmaticus therapy (13-14). However, our research team has published a case series of 5 patients 
re
ceiving nebulized ketamine for a variety of acute painful conditions and has recently completed 
a randomized double-blind trial of 120 adult patients that evaluated analgesic efficacy and safety 
of nebulized ketamine at three different dosing regimens for acute pain in the ED. 
Currently, we are conducting two additional studies evaluating the role of nebulized ketamine in 
pediatric ED and pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392126].   
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES 
To compare analgesic efficacy and rates of side effects of sub-dissociative dose ketamine at 0.3 
mg/kg dose administered via intravenous route as a short infusion over 15 minutes to a 0.75 mg/kg 
dose of ketamine administered via breath actuated nebulizer to adult patients presenting to the ED 
with acute painful and exacerbation of chronic painful conditions. 
 
HYPOTHESIS  
In our study we hypothesize that intravenous sub-dissociative-dose ketamine of 0.3 mg/kg will 
provide better analgesia at [ADDRESS_1066872]-medication administration in comparison to nebulized 
ketamine administered at 0.75 mg/kg. The primary outcome of this trial is the comparative 
reduction in participant’s pain scores at [ADDRESS_1066873] medication administration. 
 
STUDY DESIGN 
Subjects:  Patients [ADDRESS_1066874] 11- point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale and requiring 
parenteral analgesia as determined by [CONTACT_79549]. Patients’ screening and 
enrollment will be performed by [CONTACT_432465]. All patients will be 
enrolled at various times of the day when study investigators will be available for patient 
enrollment and an ED pharmacist will be available for medication preparation 
 
Maimonides Medical Center Protocol v3.0 October 12, 2021  Page 3 of 6 
 Eligibility Criteria: Patients [ADDRESS_1066875] 11- point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale.  P atients will 
have to be awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time, and will be able to demonstrate 
unde
rstanding of the informed consent process and content. Patients also will have to demonstrate 
ability to verbalize the nature of any adverse effects they might experience as well as to express 
their pain severity by [CONTACT_136448]. 
  
E
xclusion Criteria:  Altered mental status, allergy to ketamine, pregnant patients, weight greater 
than 150 kg, unstable vital signs (systolic blood pressure <90 or>180 mm Hg, pulse rate <50 or 
>150 beats/min, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] <10 or >30 breaths/min), inability to provide consent, and 
past medical history of alcohol or drug abuse, or schizophrenia. 
 
Design:  This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double dummy trial comparing analgesic 
efficacy and safety of intravenous  SDK administered  at 0.3 mg/kg over 15 minutes to nebulized 
ketamine at 0.75 mg/kg administered via BAN to patients presenting to the ED of Maimonides 
Medical Center with acute and chronic painful conditions. Upon meeting the eligibility criteria, 
patients will be randomized into two study groups: IV SDK and Nebulized K- BA 
 
Data Collection Procedures:  Each patient will be approached by a study investigator for 
acquisition of written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
authorization after being evaluated by [CONTACT_136449]. When English will not be the participant’s primary language, a language- 
appropriate consent form will be used and non-investigator, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-employed, trained 
interpreters or licensed telephone interpreter will assist in acquisition of informed consent .  
B
aseline pain score will be determined with an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 to 10), described 
to the patient as “no pain” being 0 and “the worst pain imaginable” being 10. A study investigator 
will record the patient’s body weight and baseline vital signs.  
 
The on-duty ED pharmacist will prepare either a breath-actuated nebulizer with a dose of 0.75 
mg/kg or an infusion dose of IV SDK at 0.3 mg/kg in [ADDRESS_1066876], which will be created in SPSS (version 24; IBM Corp, Armonk, 
NY) with block randomization of every 10 participants. All participants will receive a 
corresponding placebo in order to maintain double-dummy design: the subjects randomized to 
receive IV SDK will also receive nebulized saline via BAN, and the subjects receiving K-BAN 
will also receive an IV infusion of Normal Saline over [ADDRESS_1066877] pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 
120 minutes. If patients reported a pain numeric rating scale score of 5 or greater and requested 
additional pain relief, intravenous morphine at 0.1 mg/kg will be administered as a rescue 
analgesic. 
 
Maimonides Medical Center Protocol v3.[ADDRESS_1066878], research manager, and statistician will be the only ones with 
knowledge of the study arm to which each participant would be randomized. Treating providers, 
participants, and the data collecting research team will be blind to the medication route received. 
 
 All data will be recorded on data collection sheets, including patients’ sex, demographics, medical 
hist
ory, and vital signs, and entered into SPSS (version 24.0; IBM Corp) by [CONTACT_136450]. 
Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written consent acquisition for all 
participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_776779] 
(Michael Silver), who w ill work independent ly of any data collection. 
P
atients will be closely monitored for any change in vital sings and for adverse effects during the 
entire study period (up to 120 minutes) by [CONTACT_2792]. Common adverse effects that are 
associated with sub-dissociative dose ketamine are felling of unreality, dizziness, nausea, 
vomiting, and sedation. 
 
Data Analysis:  Data analyses will include frequency distributions, paired t-test to assess a 
difference in pain scores within each group, and independent-sample t-test to assess differences in 
pain scores between the [ADDRESS_1066879] to follow-up and allow all patients’ data to 
be analyzed on an intention- to- treat principle. 
For categorical outcomes (eg, complete resolution of pain), a X2 or Fisher’s exact test will be used 
to compare outcomes at 30 minutes. Percentage differences and 95% confidence intervals between 
the treatment groups will be calculated for all time points with P<.05 to denote statistical 
significance. Based on the validation of a verbally administered rating scale of acute pain in the 
ED and the comparison of verbal and visual pain scales, we will use a primary outcome consisting 
of a minimal clinically meaningful difference of 1.3 between three groups at the 30-minute pain 
assessment.28,29  
 
Sample Size:  Assuming a greater improvement in pain score in the IV group of 1.3 points over 
the nebulized group, with a SD of 3.0 in both groups, we will need to enroll 67 patients per group 
(134 
total) to have 80% power at alpha = 0.0465, for a one-sided z-test. To account for possible 
missing data the total sample size will be 150 patients (75 per group). A pre-planned interim data 
a
nalysis will occur upon reaching a total of total of 60 patients (30 patients per group), and alpha  
= 0.0035 will be used to maintain overall power, this will make the overall alpha of the study 0.05. 
 
Expected Outcomes: The primary outcome will include a comparative reduction of pain scores 
on numeric rating pain scale (NRS) between recipi[INVESTIGATOR_776775] K-BAN at [ADDRESS_1066880]-
analgesic administration.  
 
SAE Reporting:   Any serious adverse event, requiring intervention, will be reported to the IRB 
withi
n 24 hours of discovery by [CONTACT_16133]. Less serious adverse events will be reported 
within a week of discovery.  There are known expected outcomes and side effects to the procedures 
and medications being received and these are the same risks/side effects as the standard of care – 
these
 will be reported if they are serious and require intervention.

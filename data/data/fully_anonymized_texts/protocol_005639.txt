Page 3 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) 1.[ADDRESS_626518] a patient-level community-based effectiveness trial of the 
comprehensive, mobile app-based cognitive-behavioral intervention reSET-O, to determine whether this 
intervention improves the adherence to and outcome of medication assisted treatment (MAT)for opi[INVESTIGATOR_46212] (OUD) in the setting of a Hub and Spoke implementation system.
This RCT is part of an R21/R33 NIH grant. The R21 pi[INVESTIGATOR_487502] (IRB: 00009931) with 
some subjective positive observations in terms of subject participation and engagement with the app. 
The R21 trial has laid the ground work for the R33 to be conducted successfully. 
The primary hypothesis is that a greater proportion of patients assigned to Treatment As Usual (TAU) + 
reSET-O, compared to those assigned to TAU alone, will complete 6 months of MAT.
The Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute (PPI) is committed to providing a wide range of high quality 
behavioral health services, including an Opi[INVESTIGATOR_487503] (OTP) established in October 2017. 
Through the Pennsylvania Coordinated Medication Assisted Treatment (PACMAT) system, PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487504] “Hub,” herein referred to as the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487505], offering medication assisted treatment (MAT) with 
methadone, dispensed and prescribed buprenorphine-naloxone (suboxone) and buprenorphine 
(Subutex).  The PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487506] a limited number of patients.  The PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_487507]-based Cor-[ADDRESS_626519] article, reSET-O (Pear Therapeutics, Inc.), is a commercially available version of the web-
based Therapeutic Education System (TES).
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints
The primary outcome measure will be retention in treatment on MAT for 6 months after initiation. 
1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints
The secondary outcome measures will be opi[INVESTIGATOR_487508] (urine and self-report), 
craving, and measures of quality of life including mental health symptoms and social functioning.  
Exploratory analyses will examine whether the effect of reSET-O on 6-month adherence is mediated by 
[CONTACT_487567].
2.0 Background 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps
Medication assisted treatment (MAT) is a cornerstone of an effective national response to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_372471] (OUD).  A key goal of the SAMHSA-funded State Targeted Response (STR) grants is 
to make MAT widely available to patients with OUD throughout the U.S. by [CONTACT_487568].  However, a major barrier to the effectiveness of MAT is patient 
adherence.  Studies show that 50% or more of patients with OUD initiating MAT will drop out of 
treatment within the first [ADDRESS_626520] patients to enter into long term 
abstinence and recovery.
2.2 Previous Data
STUDY00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 4 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) The Opi[INVESTIGATOR_487509] (MAT)
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_487510], reaching virtually every region of the U.S.  
It is estimated that 2.4 million Americans are currently addicted to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and the prognosis is poor, if 
left untreated, including mortality from opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211] (Hser et al., 2001). Different types of MAT such 
as buprenorphine-naloxone, buprenorphine, methadone, and extended-release naltrexone, may be 
remarkably effective if patients adhere to treatment, the challenge is adherence to treatment.  Studies 
of buprenorphine-naloxone, specifically, typi[INVESTIGATOR_487511] 50% of patients retained in treatment 
for 6 months (Hser et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2017), and dropout from treatment is associated with relapse 
(Weiss et al., 2011; 2015; Hser et al., 2016; 2017).  Hence, to combat the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817], it is critical 
that MAT become universally available, and that patients’ adherence to MAT be improved.  
The digitally delivered intervention to be tested in this proposed study, reSET-O, targets treatment 
adherence, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_55228], and adherence to medication, while utilizing techniques of cognitive 
behavioral therapy and skills to avoid drug use and address problems with cravings, mood, and 
relationships, in order to avoid relapse, and rebuild a healthy lifestyle to support long term recovery. 
Barriers to Implementation of MAT and the Penn State Hub and Spoke System
Three evidence-based Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) approaches for treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_487512] U.S., methadone, buprenorphine, and extended release injection 
naltrexone. Maintenance treatment with methadone, a full opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641], has been available for 
treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_487513] 1970s.  Methadone can only be prescribed under special 
regulations that are burdensome to patients (e.g. daily attendance at clinic required initially). 
Buprenorphine, approved in the U.S. in 2002, is a partial opi[INVESTIGATOR_487514], similar 
effectiveness, and more widespread availability than methadone, since it can be prescribed by [CONTACT_487569] a modest training requirement.  However, the supply of physicians 
actively prescribing buprenorphine remains limited.  New prescribers need to be trained and supported 
within a variety of available clinical settings.  The SAMHSA Opi[INVESTIGATOR_487515] 2017 provided additional funding for MAT and encouraged the use of implementation 
models to address the shortage of prescribers, case managers, and associated services.  With STR 
funding to the State of Pennsylvania, the Penn State-Hershey Medical Center established a Hub and 
Spoke (described below), based at Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute, which is modeled on the Vermont 
program (Brooklyn and Sigmon 2017).  This Hub and Spoke offers methadone, buprenorphine and 
buprenorphine-naloxone.  It is within this system that the study proposed here will unfold, so that the 
findings may generalize to other States and regions around the U.S. utilizing similar models that support 
expansion of MAT through specialty clinic Hubs and primary care Spokes.  All three forms of MAT are 
subject to substantial rates of dropout from treatment, and dropout carries a high risk of relapse to 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  It is our hypothesis that reSET-O will reduce dropout and hence improve the effectiveness of 
MAT treatment. 
Barriers to Implementation of MAT: The Importance of Behavioral Therapy
Another key systemic barrier that has been identified is lack of access to behavioral intervention and 
counseling to accompany MAT prescribing (Quest et al., 2012; Hutchinson et al., 2014; DeFlavio et al., 
2015).  Provision of counseling is a regulatory requirement for methadone, buprenorphine, and 
buprenorphine-naloxone treatment.  Further, evidence suggests that counseling and behavioral 
treatments improve adherence to and effectiveness of MAT (McLellan et al., 1993), particularly 
contingency management approaches (Peirce et al., 2006; Nunes et al., 2006; Carroll and Weiss 2017).  
Primary care practices and other clinical settings new to treating addictions typi[INVESTIGATOR_487516].  Even addiction treatment programs serving as “hubs” may 
struggle to deliver more than rudimentary counseling due to time constraints and lack of expertise in 
the latest evidence-based interventions.  The intervention to be tested in this proposed study, reSET-O, 
is a comprehensive cognitive behavioral treatment, with a strong evidence-base to suggest that it can 
improve adherence and outcome of MAT treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD), compared to 
standard counseling.  Since it is a mobile app, delivered through patients interacting with a smart phone, 
it does not require a large time commitment or behavioral health expertise of clinical staff.  Thus, reSET-

Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 5 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) O has the potential to address the need for behavioral treatment as part of STR efforts to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_487517], while improving the effectiveness of MAT at ushering patients into stable recovery.  
2.[ADDRESS_626521] of a randomized control trial of 
comprehensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to increase the effectiveness of MAT for the 
treatment of OUD in the context of a regional effort to expand implementation of MAT.  As a 
comprehensive CBT treatment, reSET-O focuses not only on drug use, craving, and medication 
adherence, but also on skills to help patients address common problem areas, such as relationships, 
mood and related problems, and social functioning, in order to rebuild a healthy lifestyle.  It is also 
individualized in that patients can select and repeat therapy lessons relevant to their most pressing 
problem areas.  Most evidence-based behavioral interventions are delivered by [CONTACT_487570], and substantial time of 
clinical staff to actually deliver the intervention to patients at scale.  Clinicians’ time and expertise are 
resources that are in short supply in community-based efforts to expand implementation of MAT and 
have been identified as significant barriers to delivering MAT to date.  If found effective in the trial 
proposed here, reSET-O has the potential to lead the field of MAT implementation toward a new 
paradigm where a behavioral intervention becomes a resource that can be down-loaded from the web 
and prescribed to patients, rather than an intervention that needs to be learned and painstakingly 
delivered by [CONTACT_15098].  This has the potential to promote widespread implementation of MAT both by 
[CONTACT_487571], and by [CONTACT_487572].  This effort may also in the long run encourage the development of other web-
based behavioral interventions to support implementation of MAT.

from the research study. This information will also be outlined in the consent form. 
3.3.2 Follow-up for withdrawn subjects
Withdrawn subjects will be categorized by [CONTACT_487574] (disease progression, etc.), and 
the timing of withdrawal at the 1, 3, and 6-month time points. Withdrawn subjects will not be 
replaced. Withdrawn subjects will have the opportunity to have a follow-up visit with the study 
doctor if there are any concerns regarding next steps and/or treatment.
4.0 Recruitment Methods
4.1 Identification of subjects
Patients will be identified at the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487518]. 
Patients are categorized as either Hub or Bridge/Spoke patients, depending on if they routinely seek 
treatment at the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487519] a Spoke site.  The PACMAT Hub and Spokes system of care has a strong 
track record of recruiting patients with substance abuse disorders. These centers are already providing 
treatment for patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD), making them a primary source of treatment and 
attracting a high volume of patients.  Additionally, the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487520] a valued partnership with the 
Recovery-Advocacy-Service-Empowerment (RASE) Project and Just for Today (JFT) Recovery Services 
that connect clients to the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487521].
All patients entering treatment for OUD within the PACMAT Hub and Spoke system will be verbally 
introduced to the study by [CONTACT_487575] a study team member. Patients who are 
interested in participating in the study will be taken to the research office in the clinic and will engage in 
a phone call/zoom session with a research assistant to begin the recruitment process (if the research 
assistant is working remotely). If the research assistant is on site, then they will escort the patient to the 
research room for in-person recruitment. Those interested in learning more about the study will be 
scheduled for an appointment to ask questions about the study, go through the consenting process. 
Complete baseline questionnaires, and be randomized. Recruitment appointments will be scheduled 7-
[ADDRESS_626523] of the patient’s 
choosing (i.e. patient’s home). All in-person research activities will occur at the PPI [CONTACT_6903]. 
In addition, research staff will place project flyers and handouts in the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487522] (submitted with this modification). Flyers and handouts will introduce the project and 
provide contact [CONTACT_3031] (email and phone) for research staff. If patients reach out to research staff

process.
Providers at PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487523]. Providers at PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487524]-house and through 
telehealth procedures. Providers will login to the clinician dashboard to discuss modules completed with 
patients (either virtually or in-person) who have agreed to participate and have also been assigned to 
use the app. Once the study is complete, these providers will also be asked to engage in an open-ended 
discussion about the research study and complete a brief survey regarding the feasibility and 
acceptability of the app intervention. This open-ended discussion and survey may be done remotely or 
in-person, depending on the status of the current COVID19 pandemic at the end of this study.
Providers will only use the clinician dashboard side of the app to review their patient-completed 
modules and discuss these modules with their appropriate patients. Providers will not use the app for 
their patients who do not wish to be in the research or who have decided to quit the research study. 
Providers will receive a running list from research staff of their patients who are enrolled in the study 
and assigned to the use the app. This will be updated and provided on a monthly basis.

practitioner.  Patients who are interested in the study will be asked to talk with a research 
assistant via phone, zoom session, or in-person in a private room (within the clinic). 
4.2.[ADDRESS_626525] unless HIPAA Authorization 
is obtained OR a waiver of HIPAA Authorization when applicable for the screening procedures 
is approved by [CONTACT_1201].  [For FDA regulated studies, consent for any screening activities would 
need to be obtained prior to screening unless specifically waived by [CONTACT_1201].]
Screening a patient medically/psychiatrically to determine appropriate type of MAT is a clinical 
decision that is part of routine care, so that the research study is not responsible for erecting 
criteria that MAT is safe and appropriate at the outset. 
Eligibility criteria are broad with minimal exclusionary criteria in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_487527] a fully representative sample of patients seeking treatment in real 
world community-based treatment settings. Inclusion criteria include being over 18 years of age, 
being fluent in English, being interested in participating in research about opi[INVESTIGATOR_487528]00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 8 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) started Methadone or Suboxone within the past 42 days. Exclusion criteria include not being 
fluent in English and staying at a treatment facility or program where the use of cell phones or a 
tablet device is prohibited. 
5.0 Consent Process and Documentation 
5.1 Consent Process:
Check all applicable boxes below:
 Informed consent will be sought and documented with a written consent form [Complete Sections 
5.2 and 5.6] 
 Implied or verbal consent will be obtained – subjects will not sign a consent form (waiver of 
written documentation of consent) [Complete Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.6] 
  Informed consent will be sought but some of the elements of informed consent will be omitted or 
altered (e.g., deception). [Complete section 5.2, 5.4 and 5.6] 
 Informed consent will not be obtained – request to completely waive the informed consent 
requirement. [Complete Section 5.5]
5.2 Obtaining Informed Consent 
5.2.1 Timing and Location of Consent 
Consent will occur 0-42 days after the intake appointment. Consenting will occur through a 
remote zoom session conversation (when the research assistant is working remotely) and in-
person (when the research assistant is on site) while the prospective participant is at the PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_487505]. The baseline research appointment will be scheduled as a remote session during a time 
that is conducive for both the research staff and potential research subject. The subject and 
research coordinator will review the consent form over a zoom session or in-person. The subject 
will be offered either an electronic version of the consent form or a hard copy of the consent 
form to review on their own before the consent meeting and/or during the meeting. Subjects 
will be given time to review the consent form and all questions will be answered by [CONTACT_10117]. IRB approved hard copy consent forms will be stored in unlocked cabinets in 
research rooms where the zoom consenting session will take place, in which a research assistant 
may instruct the participant to retrieve if appropriate. The consent form may also be emailed or 
mailed to the subject (before the meeting or during). The subject will be allowed to take the 
consent form home for further review or to discuss with family, friends, or a provider actively 
involved in their care if they wish. 
If participants are interested in participating in the study, they will have three different options 
for completing the consent process (depending on if the research assistant is working on-site or 
remotely):
1. Patients will be sent a REDcap link via personal email or text message on the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487529], a personal cell phone, or a personal tablet device. This REDcap link 
will ask for participant consent including the date and time, entry of their first and last 
name, as well as their signature [CONTACT_487614] a computer mouse or finger. The 
individual obtaining consent will also complete a REDcap form indicating the date, time, 
and signature [CONTACT_487615]. REDcap has the 
ability to data-lock fields. As soon as the participant and consenter sign the REDcap 
consent form, the consenter will lock the data fields.

Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 9 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) 2. If there are technological challenges using the e-signature [CONTACT_487616] a different option, the patient will have the option of signing a hard copy 
of the consent form. If the patient chooses this option, then research staff will also 
complete the “Phone Consent to Participate In a Research Study Signature [CONTACT_3490].” Once 
both forms have been collected, the baseline process (baseline surveys) can continue. 
3. If research staff are on-site, research staff will provide the patient with a hard copy of 
the consent form and both the patient and research staff will sign the same consent 
form. 
Upon obtaining consent, participants will be asked to complete a brief quiz with questions 
related to the consent form. It is estimated that this quiz will take 5-10 minutes to complete and 
is used to ensure the participant’s understanding of the consent form and the research study 
overall. There is no penalty for incorrect answers to the consent quiz questions. For any consent 
quiz question that is answered incorrectly, the research staff conducting the consent 
appointment will review the respective areas to ensure the participant’s understanding. A copy 
of the signed consent form will be emailed or mailed to the participant. If in person, a copy of 
the signed consent form will be handed to the patient. We may also email the signed consent 
form to the participant’s PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487530], who is also a study team member, to print the 
form at the clinic and physically hand the form to the participant. Method of delivery of the 
signed consent form will be based on participant preference. 
Providers engaging with the app as appropriate will be provided a summary of explanation for 
research to provide an overall synopsis of the study as well as their involvement. This summary 
of explanation will be emailed to all providers engaging with the app. Provider questions may be 
answered via email or over the phone.
We will ensure that the participant is completing the correct version of the consent by [CONTACT_487576]-O project based on the IRB approval date. This will be 
noted/filed in the regulatory binder to ensure smooth quality assurance checks and monitoring. 
This way, there is no confusion as to which consent form database needs to be used, which will 
be particularly helpful once the consent IRB stamp of approval changes as a result of continuing 
reviews, modifications, etc.
If updated versions of the consent and/or addendums are required, we will generate new 
consent and/or addendum databases within the reSET-O project in REDcap. We will be sure to 
date the databases with the most recently approved IRB version to avoid confusion on which 
REDcap consent database should be used. Newly enrolled participants from that point would 
then complete the new, updated consent form. Established participants would then be 
contact[CONTACT_487577] e-signature [CONTACT_487617]. The same 
steps above, as outlined for consent completion, will occur for addendum review and signature.

greater than Minimal Risk and the purpose of the research is the development of important 
biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by [CONTACT_86416].
Providers will have the opportunity to review the summary of consent of research and may ask 
questions at any point in time. They may refuse to participate in the open-ended discussion and 
they do not have to answer any questions on the survey that they do not wish or feel 
comfortable answering.
Consent is obtained only by [CONTACT_3647] (research coordinator, research assistants), and not 
by [CONTACT_487578], in order to ensure that patients do not feel obligated to their clinicians to 
consent to the research.  The consent form, and consent discussion with research staff, make it 
clear that research participation is voluntary and does not affect the ability to obtain treatment.
5.3 Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent 
Providers engaging with the app as appropriate will be provided a summary of explanation for research 
to provide an overall synopsis of the study as well as their involvement. Consent will be implied by 
[CONTACT_487579], at the completion of the study, engaging 
in an open-ended discussion and completing the survey about feasibility and acceptability of the app 
intervention. Informed consent will be sought but some of the elements of informed consent will be 
omitted or altered (e.g., deception).

statistician and master’s level analyst located in the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) at 
Penn State College of Medicine. The Columbia University biostatistician will be available for consultation 
and guidance throughout data analysis; Columbia University will not be directly handling study data 
beyond that required of routine quality assurance procedures and weekly study team meetings.  
We are also collaborating with the Research Foundation for Mental Health (RFMH) as affiliated with 
Columbia University. RFMH will be providing quality assurance for the project including monitoring of 
data collection of both non-PHI and PHI, as well as monitoring the regulatory binder. All monitoring 
reports completed for QA will be submitted to the Penn State IRB.
7.2 Study Procedures
7.2.1 Visit 1 (Intake/Baseline) 
During the subject’s intake appointment, eligibility is confirmed by [CONTACT_487583] a private research room. Research staff will introduce the research study to the 
participants and schedule a research appointment to discuss the project further in 7-[ADDRESS_626529] (TAU + 
reSET-O or TAU alone). Participants will be asked to undergo research assessments consisting of 
an interview and self-report questionnaires (described below), as well as urine samples collected 
at all visits (baseline, week 4(+/- 2 weeks), week 8(+/- 2 weeks), week 12(+/- 2 weeks), and week 
24(+2/- 4 weeks)). Urine toxicology for opi[INVESTIGATOR_487531]; however, urine collected at these specific clinic visits will also be used for 
STUDY00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 13 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) research purposes and used to confirm self-reports of abstinence.  This will be outlined in the 
consent form and discussed with the participant. 
Participants who are assigned to TAU + reSET-O will be briefed on the reSET-O app and will 
download the reSET-O app onto their smartphone or tablet device. Penn State research 
assistants will have the capability to generate and provide app access codes through the Pear 
Therapeutics clinician dashboard. This allows for instant access and entry into the app for the 
research subject, as opposed to waiting for several hours or even days for onboarding through 
the Patient Services Center.  However, participants will still be required to complete the Pear 
Therapeutics reSET-O patient services center (PSC) enrollment form (completed with the 
research assistant), which will be transferred to the PSC via secure file transfer (e.g. Accellion or 
Kitedrive) or by [CONTACT_6791]. The PSC is affiliated with Pear Therapeutics, the owners of the reSET-O app. 
The following information is collected on the enrollment form and faxed to PSC:
The enrollment form collects information that is used by [CONTACT_487584]’s first and last name, and a date of birth, which will be 
a “dummy” date of birth (i.e.: 01-001-1999; dd-mmm-yyyy).   The first and last name [CONTACT_487618] [INVESTIGATOR_487532]. Thus, the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487533]. The PSC form clearly indicates that 
this individual is enrolled in a research study, which allows staff at the PSC and Pear 
Therapeutics, Inc. to understand that services are not to be billed to any insurance. 
A phone number is also required for the enrollment form, which may be a phone 
number most commonly used by [CONTACT_2299], or a phone number associated with a 
research assistant’s office phone (for participants who do not have an operating phone 
number).   The phone number is needed because the PSC will call the subject weekly to 
ensure that that the participant is able to use the app without technical difficulty. The 
participant may opt out of these calls, which will be outlined in the consent form. reSET-
O, Pear Therapeutics, Inc. (owners of reSET-O), and other entities affiliated with reSET-O 
do not use phone numbers for any other purpose including selling the phone number to 
third parties, sales calls, etc.
An email is also required for the enrollment form, which may be an email most 
commonly used by [CONTACT_2299], or the research coordinator/research assistant may 
help the participant set up a free email account for purposes of this study. An email is 
needed because should the participant forget their username [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or password to login 
to the app, they will be able to reset their login credentials via email.  reSET-O, Pear 
Therapeutics, Inc. (owners of reSET-O), and other entities affiliated with reSET-O do not 
use email addresses for any other purpose including selling the email  to third parties, 
marketing or other advertisements, etc.
Participants, who do not own a smartphone, will be provided with an inexpensive tablet device 
that will be able to access reSET-O for the duration of the trial. These devices will be obtained 
and managed by [CONTACT_44498]. Should a participant lose or sell the tablet device, or if the 
device is stolen, they will be afforded a second chance with a new tablet device as provided by 
[CONTACT_1758]. Should the participant lose or sell the second device, or if the second device is stolen, 
they will not receive a third tablet device. They will still be enrolled in the study and asked to 
complete questionnaires at the appropriate time points; however, they may not be able to 
STUDY00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 14 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) engage with the app, reSET-O, unless they provide their own device that is compatible for use 
with the reSET-O app (e.g., smart phone, table).  This will also be outlined in the consent form.
After obtaining consent, randomized assignment, and getting set-up with the reSET-O app (if 
applicable) as outlined above, all participants will complete the electronic surveys listed below. 
Eligibility checklist to assess a potential participants eligibility via inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Demographics form will be used to collect basic demographic information on each participant 
(i.e.: DOB, gender, education level, etc.), and will only be collected at baseline.
Locator form collects information that will be useful in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_487534] a 
participant for assessment should they stop attending treatment, including address, phone 
number(s), and contact [CONTACT_487585].  This is important scientifically to minimize missing data due to loss to follow up. In 
order to protect confidentiality of participants, if listed significant others are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], no 
information will be divulged by [CONTACT_487586], other than that they were 
participating in a survey at Penn State and the research team in attempting to contact [CONTACT_487587]. During consent participants will be informed that it is important for research 
staff to be able to contact [CONTACT_487588], even if 
they have dropped out of treatment, and the procedures for contact[CONTACT_487589].
Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) (Sobell and Sobell, 1992; 2000) assesses self-reported alcohol and 
other drug use (frequency, quantity) using calendars and memory aids to enhance recall. We will 
not be able to provide printed calendars; however, the participant will be encouraged to use 
their phone or tablet device to view a calendar app to help enhance their recall of past 
substance use. The TLFB has good psychometric properties, including test-retest reliability with 
multiple populations, and content, criterion, and construct validity across multiple related 
measures. Additional questions will assess intensity and number of days of urges/cravings for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_487535], and HIV risk as a result of IV drug use and sharing of 
needles/works. Per the recommendation of the NIH, staff who are blinded to the randomization 
assignment of participants should complete the TLFB. Penn State research staff will complete 
the TLFB during baseline because it will be completed before randomization occurs. Columbia 
research staff will be completing the TLFB via phone/WebEx session with all subjects beginning 
with the 4-week follow-up visit. During the follow-up visits, Penn State research staff will 
complete all research tasks with the participants and help facilitate the TLFB with the Columbia 
team by:
[CONTACT_487590], text or email;  
oProviding a phone number or meeting room link so participants could reach out to the 
Columbia team directly; and/or 
oProviding the Columbia team with the participant’s contact [CONTACT_3031] (at the 
participant’s request). 
oThe research tasks with the Columbia team will occur through the participant’s phone or 
an office phone via WebEx. Columbia University requires the use of WebEx for research 
outreach to participants. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_72207] (CSS) (Litt et al., 2003) is a 23-item, self-report measure (originally 
adapted from the Processes of Change (Proschaska et al., 1998)), assessing change processes, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], and problem-solving related to urges to use substances. It has good reliability 
across samples (=.83 to .87). Two versions with only slight differences in directions will be 
administered. At intake, the directions will ask subjects to think about the last three months 
STUDY00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 15 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) when answering the questions. For all follow-up research appointments, the directions will ask 
the subject to think about their copi[INVESTIGATOR_487536]. 
Question/prompt items remain the same between the two versions.
PROMIS is a well validated and widely used scale that measures the quality of social and 
occupational functioning. 
Social Connectedness Scale (SCS) (Lee and Robbins 1995; 1998) is a 20 item, 6-point scale, self-
report assessing psychological belonging or interpersonal closeness with good reliability ( =.91).
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443]., 1999) was developed for use in primary 
health settings and screens for DSM psychiatric diagnosis of major depression and generalized 
anxiety at baseline. 
The Kessler 10 (K10) (Kessler et al., 2003) is a brief, 10-item self-report measure of general 
psychiatric distress will be collected at baseline and follow up points to address change in 
psychiatric symptoms over time. K10 has good reliability and is used in World Health 
Organization mental health surveys in 30 countries.
HIV Risk from the Sexual Experiences and Risk Behavior Assessment Schedule (SERBAS): A 
summary item from the Sexual Experiences and Risk Behavior Assessment Schedule (SERBAS), 
used as primary outcome in large HIV risk reductions studies (Tross et al., 2010), elicits the 
number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_487537] a condom over the last 
90 days using time-line follow back cues for recall.  
Time Line Follow-Back (see above) will query intravenous drug use, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_487538].
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; Posner et al., 2008):  The C-SSRS will be 
administered only to subjects who have endorsed suicidal ideation (SI) per the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ). There is one item on the PHQ that assesses self-reported SI using a Likert 
scale of 0-3 (0 = not at all; 3= nearly every day). A score of 1 or higher is considered an SI 
endorsement, which will warrant administration of the C-SSRS. Should the C-SSRS results 
indicate an SI presence/plan, a Hub PPI [CONTACT_48368] (physician or nurse practitioner) will take over 
the evaluating situation and follow PPI’s SI policy.
Intervention Acceptability/Feedback Form (IAFF) is a 7-item self-report measure comprised of 
indicators of treatment acceptability on 10-point scales: interesting, useful, new information, 
easy to understand, satisfaction, relevance to life, and likability. This will only be administered to 
patients who have been assigned to TAU + reSET-O. 
TAU Tracking Form (TTF) –completed by [CONTACT_487591] 4 weeks, including modality and frequency. Research staff will verify the 
information with the patient for accuracy.  
reSET-O Implementation and Adherence: For participants who have been assigned to TAU 
+reSET-O, we will collect data from the reSET-O data system and dashboard for each patient on 
utilization of reSET-O features (how many and which therapy lessons are completed, incentives 
earned, use of the communication features).
Weiner Intervention Appropriateness, Acceptability and Feasibility Survey: This survey will be 
completed by [CONTACT_487592]. This survey evaluates acceptability, 
STUDY00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 16 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) appropriateness, and feasibility of intervention implementation using a 5-point Likert scale 
(1=lowest score; 5=highest score).  
In cases where the Timeline Follow-Back assessment cannot be completed (patient cannot 
access the Columbia team’s WebEx room, patient must leave the research visit before 
completing), Penn State research staff will pull data from the Demographic Questionnaire Form 
that the patient completes during their intake process (attached to this modification). This 
questionnaire is also administered by [CONTACT_487593]. This 
data query is necessary because of the time sensitive nature of self-reported alcohol and drug 
use data (i.e. asking about a patient’s alcohol and drug use in the last 30 days). 
HITS (Hurt-Insult-Threaten-Scream Screening Tool): This assessment screens for domestic 
violence in participants who have a romantic partner. It will be used at both the baseline and 
endpoint visits. 
BARC-10 (Brief Assessment of Recovery Capi[INVESTIGATOR_307]): This is a 10-item measure that assesses the 
level of personal, social, physical and professional resources that someone has available. 
PCL-C (PTSD Checklist – Civilian Version): A self-report rating scale for symptoms of PTSD over 
the past 1 month. 
Overdose History: This assessment asks patients if they have ever overdosed on a substance and 
then goes into branching logic for details of the incident if they have, with questions like 
“when?”, what substance, etc. 
First Response Opi[INVESTIGATOR_487539] (FROST): This survey has questions for all research 
participants about the first time they used opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
7.2.2 Week 4 (+/- 2 weeks), Week 8 (+/- 2 weeks), Week 12 (+/- 2 weeks), & Week 24 (+2/- 4 weeks)
The same procedures and measures listed above will be repeated again at the Week 4 (+/- 2 
weeks), 8(+/- 2 weeks), 12(+/- 2 weeks) & 24(+2/- 4 weeks) follow up visits – measured from 
completion of baseline questionnaires and randomization. Given the predicted scheduling 
challenges with this population, we plan to incorporate a 2-week window for completion of 
specific visits. For the last visit, we plan to allow for a +2/-[ADDRESS_626530] been assigned to 
TAU + reSET-O (n=100) at week 4 to gather their initial thoughts on the app and identify factors 
contributing to time spent on the app. Qualitative interviews will also be conducted at weeks 8 
and 12 to elicit personal accounts of their experience using the program, acceptability of the 
program, and suggestions for improvement.  The total time to administer these qualitative 
interviews is estimated at 20-30 minutes.  The interview will be audio recorded. The audio 
recording will be stored on the Hershey Network server, accessible only by [CONTACT_487594]. The interview does not ask for PHI and therefore PHI is not expected to be in the 
recording; however, transcriptionists will be trained to remove PHI from any interviews.
reSET-O only works for [ADDRESS_626531] been 
randomly assigned to TAU + reSET-O will repeat the reSET-O enrollment process again, which 
includes the PSC form, for the continuation of their access to reSET-O. Information on the first

rollover into the extended access account, enabling subjects to pi[INVESTIGATOR_487540], modules, and revisiting completed modules.
There will be two phone check-ins with the research coordinator/ research assistant. The phone 
check-ins will occur during the 16th week and again during the 20th week of the study.  The 
phone check-in will be a simple 5-10-minute conversation to ask the subject how they are doing 
and determine if their contact [CONTACT_487596] 24-
week follow up. 
At the completion of the study, providers (i.e.: physicians, case managers, etc.) will be complete 
a five-minute survey regarding the feasibility, acceptability, barriers, and facilitation of using 
reSET-O. They will also be asked to engage in an open-ended discussion (approximately 1-1.5 
hours) to provide suggestions for improvement of the app itself or facilitation of 
implementation.  No personal information will be collected from providers about themselves. 
The open-ended discussion and survey may be done remotely, depending upon the status of the 
COVID19 pandemic
7.3 Duration of Participation
All participants are asked to participate in 5 remote or in-person research visits over 24 weeks as listed 
above, as well as participate in two phone check-ins at week 16 and week 20.  The baseline visit will take 
about 1 to 1.5 hours for subjects assigned to reSET-O +TAU, and 45 minutes to 1hour for subjects 
assigned to TAU only. For reSET-O + TAU subjects, follow-up appointments will last 30 to 45 minutes, 
with the exception of the visit that accounts for the addition of a qualitative interview (weeks 4, 8 or 12), 
which will last approximately [ADDRESS_626533] Article(s) (Study Drug(s) and/or Study Device(s))
7.4.1 Description
reSET-O: Mobile App Delivering Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention to Enhance Implementation 
of MAT
reSET-O is the commercially available version (Pear Therapeutics, Inc.) of the Therapeutic 
Education System (TES) originally developed by [CONTACT_487597], Marsch and colleagues (2008). It was 
recently approved by [CONTACT_487598].  Pear Therapeutics has agreed to provide reSET-O for this proposed 
project without cost and to collaborate on any modifications that arise during the R21 phase.  
reSET-O (TES) combines two empi[INVESTIGATOR_487541], Community 
Reinforcement Approach (CRA) and Contingency Management (CM), translating them onto a 
computer-interactive learning environment, delivered by [CONTACT_487599], without the 
direct involvement of a human therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. CRA is based on the model that substance use 
disorders develop when drug reinforcers grow in salience and displace an individual’s normal 
healthy sources of reinforcement, such as friends, family, employment, and recreation.  CRA 
teaches patients cognitive-behavioral copi[INVESTIGATOR_487542], depression and other mood problems, and relationship issues that are associated 
with risk of relapse, in order to rebuild their lives and relationships without drugs. CM provides 
concrete monetary rewards (e-giftcards) contingent on performance of one or several key target 
behaviors, such as urine-confirmed abstinence from drugs or attendance at treatment 
appointments.  CRA and CM are both highly researched therapeutic interventions for substance 
use disorders with broad empi[INVESTIGATOR_487543] (Hunt & Azrin 1973; Budney & Higgins 
1998; Miller & Meyers 1998; Stitzer & Petry 2006). When delivered together, CRA and CM have 
STUDY00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 18 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) been shown to contribute uniquely to outcomes, suggesting complementary therapeutic 
elements that enhance overall treatment effectiveness (Roozen et al., 2004; Higgins et al., 1994; 
2003). 
MAT treatment (treatment as usual) when combined with counseling has a decent success rate 
at greater than 50% patient retention over a 6-month period.  Patients retained in MAT 
treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_487544], while those who 
discontinue MAT typi[INVESTIGATOR_487545].  Therefore it is important to try to improve the 
rate of retention in treatment, which is why the reSET-O intervention is proposed. Patients 
enrolling in the study will have been prescribed their appropriate MAT as their standard of care 
and is not part of the research study.
7.4.2 Treatment Regimen
reSET-O is delivered as a mobile app and can be downloaded to and used by a smart phone or 
tablet. Buprenorphine-naloxone and buprenorphine dosing ranges from 2-24mg/day, is 
administered sublingually, and in combination with counseling.  Methadone dosing ranges from 
60-250mg/day, is administered orally, and in combination with counseling. For buprenorphine-
naloxone, buprenorphine, and methadone, initial doses are started low to avoid precipi[INVESTIGATOR_487546].
7.4.[ADDRESS_626534] to Treatment Groups
Subjects will be randomly assigned to TAU alone or TAU + reset-O, but stratified by [CONTACT_487600]:  methadone, buprenorphine initiated at the Hub and buprenorphine initiated as a 
bridge appointment with continuation of treatment at the spoke.
Randomization will be determined through a web-based data management system. The 
stratification data will be entered and the data management system will conduct the 
randomization and communicate back with the treatment assignment within the same web-
based interface.
7.4.[ADDRESS_626535] Compliance Monitoring
The Contingency Management system developed in TES, and adapted in reSET-O, utilizes the 
“prize bowl” method developed by [CONTACT_487601] (cost 
of the incentives) to make it more feasible for community-based treatment.  When a target 
behavior is performed (completing a therapy lesson, attending a clinic appointment), the patient 
earns a “draw”, where some draws yield motivational messages, some are low cost prizes, with 
the occasional higher value prize.  The program keeps track of the draws earned and prizes, so 
that, again, burden on clinical to organize the CM intervention is minimized.  Completion of 
therapy lessons automatically earns draws.
In order to further support buprenorphine adherence, reSET-O contains communication 
features, where the patient receives a daily prompt to take their buprenorphine dose, and can 
record taking each dose, as well as any drug use or craving.  This information, along with 
information on which therapy lessons a patient has completed, is summarized on a dashboard 
for each patient available that is available on line to the prescribing physician and other 
clinicians (research coordinator/research assistant in the study proposed here) to help track 
progress and stimulate discussion between patients and their clinicians.
7.4.[ADDRESS_626536] Article
Per the recommendation of NIH, the TLFB should be completed by [CONTACT_487602]. Penn State research staff will complete the TLFb 
with participants because this occurs before randomization. All TLFB conducted after the 
STUDY00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 19 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) baseline visit will be conducted by [CONTACT_487603]. Upon completion of the TLFB, the external staff member will 
transmit files to the Penn State research team via Accellion/ Kite Drive for e-storage of the 
document (on the Hershey Medical Network server, accessible through role-based security 
only), and entry into REDcap. No PHI is collected or exchanged during the TLFB process.

8.1 Number of Subjects
We will recruit and enroll 200 patients with OUD within the Penn State Hub and Spoke System 
(Pennsylvania Coordinated Medication Assisted Treatment (PACMAT), for this RCT. 
Due to the possibility of turnover and new hires, we expect approximately 12-15 providers to engage 
with and provide feedback on the app. Any new hires will not engage with the app until CITI and HIPPAA 
training is completed and a modification reflecting a team member change has been approved by [CONTACT_487604]. The team member form will be reviewed on a bi-monthly basis and updated as appropriate with 
any changes, and the IRB will be notified as soon as possible regarding these updates.
Research subjects will not be assigned to any newly hired provider until the said provider has completed 
the appropriate CITI and HIPPAA training, and has officially been added to the study team and approved 
through the Penn State IRB. 
8.2 Sample size determination
Previous studies of MAT treatment of OUD indicate substantial drop out rates--typi[INVESTIGATOR_347207] 40% to 
50% range still retained in treatment at 24 weeks.  Assuming 40% retention in the TAU treatment group, 
a sample size of 100 patients per treatment group (total N = 200) is selected to ensure sufficient power 
of 80% with a two-sided level of significance of 5% to be able to detect a difference of at least 19.7% 
between the TAU vs reSET-O + TAU treatment groups (i.e., 40% retained in TAU vs 59.7% retained in 
reSET-O + TAU).  This difference of 19.7% is equivalent to an odds-ratio of 2.22 and would be clinically 
meaningful.

Outcome Measures and Covariates
Primary outcome: The primary outcome will be a binary indicator of whether or not the patient is 
retained on MAT (methadone, buprenorphine, or buprenorphine-naloxone) treatment through 24 
weeks. For those who drop out before 24 weeks, time (week) of dropout will be recorded, and they will 
be considered as not retained. 
Secondary outcomes: 1) weeks of treatment retention (time to drop-out 0-24 weeks, survival; number 
of weeks retained, continuous); 2) urine-confirmed abstinence from opi[INVESTIGATOR_487547] 4 weeks 
(longitudinal (weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24), binary); 3) Days using opi[INVESTIGATOR_487547] 4 weeks (longitudinal, 
continuous); 4) Days using other drugs/alcohol in last 4 weeks (longitudinal, continuous); 5) copi[INVESTIGATOR_152274] (CSS mean score; longitudinal, continuous); 6) social functioning (EuroQol, SCS, global scores 
and subscales; longitudinal, continuous); 6) overall mental health symptoms (K10; longitudinal, 
continuous); 7) HIV risk behavior—days in past 30 of vaginal or anal sex without a condom (longitudinal, 
continuous); Any needle sharing in past 4 weeks (longitudinal, binary); 7) Treatment satisfaction at week 
24 (IAFF; continuous); 8) Serious adverse events (binary).
Additional variables: Covariates, primary and secondary analyses : Stratification factors: 1) any 
intravenous drug use (binary); 2) treatment with methadone vs buprenorphine at Hub vs buprenorphine 
at Spoke (categorical). Moderators: 1) both stratification factors will be explored as moderators; 2) 
demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity etc.); 3) prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_487548] (binary); 4) other substance use at baseline (any cannabis, any stimulant, any heavy 
drinking days; binary); 5) Probable major depression at baseline (binary based on PHQ score); 6) history 
of prior treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_487549] (binary). Mediators: 1) social functioning 
(EuroQol; continuous); 2) social connectedness (SCS; continuous); 3) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506] (continuous); 4) 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (CSS; continuous); and 5) mental health symptoms (K10; continuous).
Intent to Treat, Dropouts, and Missing Data
All analyses will be on the Intent-to-treat (ITT) sample, i.e., all randomized subjects (N=200) according to 
the treatment arm to which they were assigned.  For the primary outcome, patients that dropped out 
before 24 weeks will be considered not retained. For the secondary outcome urine-confirmed 
abstinence, missing data (patients who cannot be located) will assumed to be opi[INVESTIGATOR_362751] (not 
abstinent), a typi[INVESTIGATOR_487550] (Weiss et al., 2011; 2015; Hser et al., 2016; 2017).  For 
other secondary outcomes, missing data will be treated as missing at random. Longitudinal mixed 
effects models do not require complete data to provide estimates of the outcome, and the estimates 
are considered valid under the assumption that the data are missing at random (Little & Rubin, 2002). 
We will additionally perform sensitivity analysis for the secondary outcomes to examine the influence 
on the outcomes of dropout and missing data by [CONTACT_362811], for instance 
imputing missing weeks as all abstinent or all non-abstinent.  Comparison of the inferences from 
assuming various models for the missingness provides a measure of the validity of the efficacy estimate 
from the initial model.
Significance Testing and Preliminary Analyses
All tests for main effects will be performed at two-sided significance level of 5%. Before performing 
specific analyses, we will examine the distribution of outcome measures and covariates and investigate 
for outliers. The distributions of continuous variables will be checked for normality, and transformed, if 
necessary. Distribution of demographic variables will be examined and described in terms of means, 
standard deviations, proportions and 95% confidence intervals. Covariates will be examined for 
association with treatment outcome. Covariates associated with treatment outcome will be adjusted for 
in models used to test study hypotheses.

Page 21 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) Statistical Model:  Hypothesis:  Adding reSET-O to TAU (reSET-O + TAU arm) will promote greater [ADDRESS_626538] of 
randomization to the reSET-O+TAU group compared to TAU group will be estimated using logistic 
regression with the binary outcome of retention in treatment for 24 weeks (yes/no) modeled as a 
function of treatment condition (reSET-O + TAU vs TAU) and stratification factors (methadone 
treatment; buprenorphine treatment at Hub; buprenorphine treatment initiation at hub and 
continuation at spoke) and intravenous drug use in last 30 days (yes/no).  The odds ratio of the 
treatment term and its confidence limits will estimate the treatment effect.  The raw retention rates in 
each treatment group and rate differences will be computed for descriptive purposes.  
Secondary outcomes
Statistical Models : For each of the secondary outcomes (see above) the effect of randomization to the 
reSET-O+TAU arm compared to the TAU arm will be estimated with a model of the same general form as 
for the primary outcome (three independent variables: treatment assignments (reSET-O+TAU vs TAU) 
and the two stratification factors) using logistic regression model (for binary outcomes), generalized 
linear model (for continuous outcomes), or longitudinal generalized mixed effects model (for 
longitudinal outcomes) with appropriate link functions (e.g. logit for binary outcomes). Longitudinal 
outcomes analyzed using a mixed effects models will utilize a generalized estimating equation with an 
autoregressive correlation structure to account for within subject correlation over time, as well a 
random intercept accounting for between subject variability. Retention data will be displayed with 
Kaplan-Meier curves that show the observed probability of retention in the program until time t, over 
time across the 24-week trial. The time to not-retained (dropout) data for reSET-O +TAU and TAU groups 
will be analyzed using proportional hazards models with covariates. If proportional hazard assumption is 
not satisfied, the data will be analyzed using a non-parametric log-rank test. In addition to stratification 
factors, covariates that are found to be related to the outcomes will be also added to the models to 
improve the power for detecting significant differences.
Moderation and Mediation
Moderation Statistical Models: The effect of randomization to the reSET-O+TAU arm will be estimated 
for subpopulations based on the demographic and baseline characteristics selected as moderators (see 
above). We will estimate the moderation effect on primary outcome using a similar model to Aim 1 
primary outcome with the inclusion of moderator by [CONTACT_9866]: Y i= 0+1Trx i+2Mi 
+3Trx iMi+4Ci+si where M i is the moderator status for ith subject and Trx i is subject’s treatment 
assignment. Regardless of the significance of the interaction term, we will use the model to estimate the 
95% confidence interval of the treatment effect for each level or category of the moderator variable. 
The moderator analyses are exploratory and hypothesis generating, but significant moderator effects 
can be useful in planning future efforts at implementation of reSET-O by [CONTACT_487605].  Identifying subgroups where there is less benefit may suggest future modifications 
to reSET-O or its implementation strategy to achieve better effect in those subgoups.
Mediation Statistical Models: The effect of randomization to the reSET-O +TAU arm will be estimated 
when accounting for potential mediators (see above).  In particular, we are interested in testing whether 
an impact of treatment on the primary outcome of 24 week buprenorphine retention is mediated by 
[CONTACT_487606][INVESTIGATOR_25110] (CSS), which are targets of the therapy lessons or modules of reSET-O, as 
well as social functioning (PROMIS) and social connectedness. We will simultaneously estimate both the 
total effect of treatment assignment on primary outcome and the indirect of treatment assignment on 
primary outcome mediated through the intended target mediators using structural equation modeling 
(SEM) in software MPlus (Taylor, MacKinnon and Tein 2008). The indirect effect is estimated by [CONTACT_487607]. SEM will provide an estimate of the indirect 
effect of each mediator as well as its bootstrapped 95% confidence interval. These mediational analyses 
explore whether the effect of reSET-O on the primary outcome is being channeled through reSET-O

Page 22 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) having an impact on its intended targets (abstinence/relapse prevention, and psychosocial functioning) 
(i.e. main effects of treatment assignment on mediator).  This can, again, be of heuristic value in 
suggesting aspects of either reSET-O itself or its implementation that might need strengthening in future 
research or implementation efforts.
Implementation Outcomes
Measures of reSET-O utilization and adherence (number and types of therapy lessons completed, 
incentives earned, utilization of communication features) will be summarized with descriptive statistics, 
and associations with baseline covariates explored to understand what factors may drive reSET-O 
utilization, including patient characteristics and clinical setting (Hub vs Spoke).
 
Qualitative Interviews conducted with reSET-O patients will elicit personal their experiences with reSET-
O and its acceptability, feasibility, barriers and facilitators, and suggestions for improvement. A 
Qualitative Interview was previously developed in consultation with the Advisory Board, for the R21 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (Penn State IRB 00009931). Qualitative data analyses from the result of the qualitative 
interview, as well as using experiences from the R21 pi[INVESTIGATOR_487551], may indicate 
changes to improve the current qualitative interview that is expected to be used and incorporate 
standard implementation outcomes (Glasgow et al., 1999). Using Atlas.ti software and a coding 
framework developed from the qualitative interview, research staff (Campbell, Aydingolo) will 
systematically code transcripts of the interviews, resolving discrepancies in consensus discussion. The 
descriptive implementation data and interviews will be presented to the Advisory Board and used to 
help understand the feasibility of future implementation efforts across the State and beyond.  
9.0 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
9.1 Periodic evaluation of data
Data is directly entered into REDcap by [CONTACT_245841].  The research coordinator will 
periodically check the data as it is entered to ensure REDcap is working properly and recording the data 
as appropriate.  Regular quality assurance monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_18854]. Aydingolo (Columbia) 
who will remotely review regulatory documentation, data collection and data management procedures, 
and review other study documentation (e.g., progress notes, error corrections, contingency 
management logs). These reviews will also include: 100% review of informed consents, eligibility criteria, 
AE and SAE documentation, and protocol violations. 
9.2 Data that are reviewed
Data reviews include regulatory documentation, data entered directly into REDcap, progress notes, 
error corrections, contingency management logs, informed consent and eligibility criteria, AE and SAE 
documentation, and protocol violations. 
9.3 Method of collection of safety information
Study progress and safety will be reviewed weekly via conference call with the Study PIs and research 
team.  Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs, will be provided to 
PIs following each of the QA monitoring visits. An Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list 
and summary of AEs.  The Annual Report will be submitted to the data safety monitoring board (DSMB), 
IRB and NCCIH per their requirements.  The IRB and other applicable recipi[INVESTIGATOR_487552]. 
9.4 Frequency of data collection
Data collection is ongoing as it includes cumulative data (data received from the reSET-O app) and 
discrete data (data collected by [CONTACT_487608] – baseline and week 4, 8, 12, 
and 24 visits).

Page 23 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) 9.5 Individuals reviewing the data
Oversight of data management, including data collection, storage, and export, security, tracking, data 
analysis software and hardware, and quality assurance will be the responsibility of Drs. Kawasaki and 
Nunes. A senior (bio)statistician and master’s level analyst from the CTSI at Penn State College of 
Medicine will conduct analysis of REDCap survey data as well as app data from Pear Therapeutics. [CONTACT_487619], senior Biostatistician at CUMC, will be available for consultation as needed throughout the 
data analysis process but will not play an active role in the analysis itself. [CONTACT_487620], under 
supervision of Drs. Kawasaki and Nunes, will be responsible for monitoring of data export, storage, and 
management. Weekly remote meetings will take place between Drs. Kawasaki and Nunes, [CONTACT_487621], and study site research staff. 
9.[ADDRESS_626539] who has been assigned to reSET-O+TAU meets with a research coordinator for a 
research appointment or meets with their clinician involved in their substance abuse treatment and is 
affiliated with the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487553]/or RASE or JFT These clinicians are defined as reSET-O research study 
coordinators, PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487554], PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487555], PPI [INVESTIGATOR_487556], JFT “Certified 
Recovery Specialist’s" or RASE care coordinator. These clinicians will login to the clinician dashboard side 
of the app and view how many modules the client has completed and the amount of rewards the client 
has earned, as well as logging urine drug screens as favorable or unfavorable. If a subject reports 
problems with the app or a clinician notes problems with the app and how data may be recorded, Pear 
Therapeutics, Inc. will be notified immediately to mitigate the issue(s). 
9.7 Statistical tests
Drs. Kawasaki and Nunes will provide oversight to the statistical analysis process, ensuring timely 
provision of cleaned and locked data to the statistics team; data will be shared with the CTSI statistician 
and analyst following data lock, and [CONTACT_487622] (Columbia) will provide as needed consultation on 
data and statistical issues throughout the trial.  Detailed statistical analysis plan is described under 
Section 8.3, above 
9.8 Suspension of research
This study will be stopped prior to its completion if: (1) the intervention is associated with adverse 
effects that call into question the safety of the intervention; (2) difficulty in study recruitment or 
retention will significantly impact the ability to evaluate the study endpoints; (3) any new information 
becomes available during the trial that necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; or (4) other situations occur that 
might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].

incentives for adherence to treatment, and enhanced communication with providers, features which entail little 
anticipated risk. Potential risks for the research participation include psychological discomfort, answering 
sensitive questions related to substance use, mental health, and sexual behaviors, loss of confidentiality, and 
disclosure of information that meets reporting requirements.  The interventions (reSET-O + TAU; TAU alone) 
may be ineffective, and patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_487557].  
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality as absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. However, research staff 
will take precautions and maintain data created by [CONTACT_487609]. 
There is a risk of randomization as only half of the participant population will receive reSET-O + TAU (n=100). 
Therefore, subjects who are assigned to TAU alone will not be exposed to the content affiliated with the reSET-O 
STUDY00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 24 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) app, including psychoeducation about skills for avoiding drug use and otherwise improving health. These 
subjects will also not receive the monetary incentives for adherence to treatment as affiliated with the app, or 
the monetary incentive to complete the qualitative interview as this interview is specific to the use of the reSET-
O app. 
All of the assessment surveys or questionnaires outline above may lead to some psychological discomfort as 
participants discuss sensitive areas related to high risk drug or sexual behaviors. They may feel uncomfortable 
answering such questions and/or become distressed when faced with reviewing their involvement in high risk 
behaviors. 
Some of the questionnaires and interview questions will ask about participant feelings, such as depression, 
sadness, and anxiety. If responses indicate suicidal thoughts or risks of the subject hurting themselves or others, 
then we may need to break confidentiality and contact a licensed mental health professional or law 
enforcement officer. All subjects who express any suicidal thoughts will be referred for follow-up mental health 
counseling.
For subjects assigned to TAU + reSET-O, reSET-O should not induce any more discomfort than other treatments 
offered as part of outpatient substance abuse treatment. If participants become overly distressed, they will be 
directed to clinical staff working at their treatment program.  Research staff (Research Coordinator and Research 
Assistants) will be trained in a safety protocol, so that if patients reveal acute distress or serious symptoms (e.g. 
depression or suicidal ideation) during a research assessment, the research staff will alert clinical staff at 
PACMAT, who will take over evaluating the situation and determine the severity of distress and if any additional 
evaluation or treatment is needed.
Subjects assigned to TAU + reSET-O will interact with reSET-O on the participant’s mobile device (smartphone or 
tablet). A patient may interact with all the functionalities of reSET-O whether or not in the presence of a wireless 
signal or wifi.  The program will update whenever coming in contact [CONTACT_487610].    Although information and 
answers within reSET-O cannot be accessed, the reSET-O website could become known and someone could look 
up the general website of the developer. They would be able to see that reSET-O (in general) and Pear 
Therapeutics, Inc. (the company that developed the reSET-O) are generally linked to substance abuse prevention 
and treatment.
Providers who are also considered subjects as a result of providing data about the app may be exposed to 
minimal risk. For instance, providers may find it cumbersome and time consuming to add some study related 
tasks to their overall workload; however, the goal of this study is not to add a significant amount of work to the 
providers; rather, the goal is to have the providers incorporate the use of the app during their clinical 
appointments with appropriate participants. We expect this workload to add approximately 6-12 minutes of 
additional time related to work tasks. Providers are free to engage in the app for longer than this if they plan to 
explore the app more and its resources. Providers may also find the open-ended discussion time consuming; 
however, they will only be asked to do this once. 
The consent process will indicate the potential risks of participating in the study and participants will be advised 
that they do not have to answer questions with which they do not feel comfortable. The assessment will allow 
participants to skip any question they do not want to answer. The consent form will also indicate that 
participants are free to discontinue the study at any time for any reason with no explanation.
The summary of explanation of research for providers will outline any risks. It will be explained to providers that 
they are not required to participate in the open-ended discussion. They are not required to answer any 
questions about the app on the survey that they do not feel comfortable answering. 
11.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects and Others 
11.1 Potential Benefits to Subjects
STUDY00012685
Approval: 3/26/2024
Page 25 of 33 (V.01/21/2019) There may be no benefit to participants in the research.  Prior evidence suggests reSET-O may improve 
adherence with appointments, adherence to medication, and skills to avoid drug use and relapse.  
However, the purpose of the research is to determine whether this benefit will be observed when 
reSET-O is implemented within a Hub and Spoke system. 
There is no benefit to the provider subjects. 
11.2 Potential Benefits to Others
This study addresses one of the key barriers to implementation of MAT within efforts to expand MAT 
into underserved communities and primary care settings, namely the need to deliver evidence-based 
psychosocial treatment to help prevent relapse and foster a healthy lifestyle when behavioral health 
specialists are rarely co-located.  Since reSET-O is a commercially mobile app, downloadable from the 
web, if found effective in supporting MAT in the Hub and Spoke setting under this research, it has the 
potential to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_487558] U.S. health system in support of the STR initiative.
 
12.0 Sharing Results with Subjects
N/A
13.[ADDRESS_626541] Payment and/or Travel Reimbursements
All patients will be compensated for their time spent completing research evaluations, with $40 for the 
intake/baseline visit and $25 for each of the week 4, 8, 12, and 24 research visits (regardless if all tasks are 
completed onsite or if some tasks are completed remotely). An extra $[ADDRESS_626542] been assigned to TAU + reSET-O will participate in the qualitative 
interview. Thus, total compensation will be $165 in the form of gift cards for individuals assigned to TAU + 
reSET-O, and the total compensation for individuals assigned to TAU alone will be $140 in the form of gift cards. 
Gift cards earned based on completed research appointments will be printed and handed to the participant or 
emailed to the participant – based on participant preference. If emailed, research assistants will follow-up with 
the participant to ensure that the gift card was received; however, it will be outlined in the consent form that 
“lost” gift cards will not be replaced. This study does not plan to use Greenphire because the ability to withdraw 
actual cash from the Greenphire card would allow a vulnerable patient with addiction to potentially withdraw 
money to purchase drugs or alcohol. Gift cards provided in this study are never associated with vendors that sell 
alcohol, drugs, or weapons (e.g., Target).  
Additionally, patients assigned to TAU + reSET-O may receive contingency management rewards as part of the 
reSET-O application program. Participants also have the possibility of earning monetary prizes ranging from $5 
to $100, in the form of a vendor gift card (e.g. Amazon or Starbucks), on a varying reinforcement schedule. 
Participants may earn prizes through a wheel-spin gaming system as coded within the app. Wheel-spi[INVESTIGATOR_487559], meaning no illegal substance is present in the participant’s 
urine, and learning module (within the app) completion.  Urine drug screens are evaluated based on urine 
screens collected at visits 4, 8, 12, and 24, in which the assessing clinician or research coordinator will use the 
Clinician Dashboard on the reSET-O app to activate the lottery-based reward.  The reSET-O app will manage the 
administration and activation of lottery-based rewards for participant completed modules.  
Half of the lottery-based rewards will be e-language positive reinforcement (i.e.: “Good Job!”). 41.8% of the 
rewards will be $5 electronic gift cards; 8.0% of the rewards will be $20 electronic gift cards; and 0.2% of the 
rewards will be $100 electronic gift cards (see uploaded power point document as an example of e-gift card 
administration from the reSET-O app).  All electronic gift cards are managed and administered by [CONTACT_487611]-O

18.1 Adverse Event Definitions
For drug studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:
Adverse event Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related
Adverse reaction Any adverse event caused by a drug
Suspected adverse 
reactionAny adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.
Reasonable possibility.  For the purpose of IND safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the adverse event.
Serious adverse 
event or Serious 
suspected adverse 
reactionSerious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reaction: An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
Life-threatening 
adverse event or 
life-threatening 
suspected adverse 
reactionAn adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site 
principal investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research 
subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.
Unexpected 
adverse event or 
Unexpected 
suspected adverse 
reaction.  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if 
it is not listed in the investigator brochure, general investigational plan, clinical 
protocol, or elsewhere in the current IND application; or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been previously observed and/or specified.
For device studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:

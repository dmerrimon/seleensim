Introduction/Background: 
Significance Despi[INVESTIGATOR_491328], major depr ession continues to be a prevalent, debilitating 
illness. An estimated 13 to 14 million American adu lts experience debilitating depression; it is a 
more common than asthma, diabetes or angina.  In  fact, depression is one of the most frequently 
encountered presentations by [CONTACT_491356] (Berman, 2009).  Tw o-thirds of patients 
who are new to antidepressant medications do not report a timely remission of symptoms, as 
conventionally defined by a minimally 50% reduction in symptom severity and achievement of 
an absolute measured score below a specified  cut-off level (Fava, 2003; Fava & Davidson, 
1996); forty to fifty percent of patients receiving new AD medication fail to experience a 
response that is timely.  The statistic that 10 to 20% of care-seeking depressed patients remain 
significantly symptomatic after 2 years exacerbates these figures (Scott, 1988).  Only about one-
third of treated patients experience, whether on mono- or adju nctive-therapy, robust remission of 
symptoms, and this low rate despi[INVESTIGATOR_491329] a number of new treatments for depression 
in the last few years (Berman, 2009).  The cost to society of so many incompletely remitted 
patients is high: a study as long a go as [ADDRESS_631835] of depression in the US 
as $44 billion annually.  And this figure was exclusive of significant out-of-pocket costs to 
families, estimated then to be $5,000 per worker , per year (Davidson & Meltzer-Brody, 1999).  
The current cost of unsuccessfully treated depr ession is estimated at 83 billion dollars annually 
(Fleurence, 2009).  The cost to families and loved ones, and the cost of lost opportunity and life 
experience for depressed individu als personally is incalculable. 
 
Treatment Refractory Depression 
While there may be a lack of consensus in precisely defining criteria for an “incomplete 
response” to antidepressant ther apy (ADT) (e.g., “treatment refractory,” “treatment-resistant,” 
“non-responders,” “difficult to treat,” or “incom plete responders”), it is widely recognized that 
many patients do not achieve a complete respons e (remission), and up to 10% of all depressed 
patients receiving treatment fail treatment completely (Goren, 2001) .  “Treatment resistance,” for 
our purpose, is defined as the failure of at least one adequate trial of an antidepressant 
medication (Carvahlo, Machado & Cavalcante, 2008).  We note that the associated public health 
burden referenced above is derive d from all patients with continued symptoms, and this includes 
 
RUMC Page 3 of 21 11/29/10 those conventionally termed “responders” yet w ho have not achieved a true remission.  
Importantly, residual symptoms are associated w ith an increased risk of relapse (Londen, 1998; 
Thase, 1992), impaired social and occupationa l functioning (Judd, 1998; Pa ykel, 1995; Miller, 
1998), and, obviously, chronicity (Judd, 2000). Ba sed on these findings, achieving sustained 
remission is the commonly accepted “gold-standard” of therapeutic goals (Zajecka, 2003; Thase, 
2003).  
 Again, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_491330] (Papakostas and Fava, 2005), accumulating data 
indicates that many patients suffering from major depression have persistent symptoms in spi[INVESTIGATOR_491331].  To wit, Corey-Lisle et al (2004) reported that  “approximately 22% of 
patients receiving treatment for depression by [CONTACT_283721]-care physicians remitted following 6 
months of treatment.”  Similarly, Rush et al (2004) reported only an “1 1% remission rate among 
depressed outpatients” following 12 months of AD T in “one of several public-sector community 
clinics.”  In the course of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, Trivedi et al. (2006) followe d nearly 3,000 outpatients with MDD who had 
been prescribed open-label citalopram.  The aut hors reported remission rate s of 28-33%.  Finally, 
Petersen et al (2005) studied outpatients with MDD enrolled in  “one of two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based, 
academically-affiliated depression specialty clinics (namely, [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], an 
affiliate of Harvard Medical School and Rhode Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], an affiliate of Brown University),” and reported a 20.5-30.7% remi ssion rate among patients receiving a single 
treatment.  To complicate matters further,  even among patients achieving remission residual 
symptoms are common (Nierenberg et al, 1999). These lingering symptoms are associated with 
reduced adaptive psychosocial functioning (Pap akostas et al, 2004a), as well as increased 
(Paykel et al, 1995) or accelerated (Judd, 1998, 2000) re lapse rates.  In addition to this burden to 
society of incomplete symptom remission or relaps e, the side-effect burden of many ADs is high.  
Common AD and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_491332], metabolic 
syndrome, extra-pyramidal symptoms, sexual dysfunction and somnolence (ibid), and it is axiomatic that high side-effect burde n equals low medication compliance. 
 
Augmentation and combination 
Augmentation or combination treatment as a tr eatment strategy, suggested by [CONTACT_491357].  Th ese treatment strategies may increase symptom relief, treatment 
compliance, and ease side-effect burden (Fava & Rush, 2006).  Potential alternative medication 
strategies in difficult cases include the use of lithium, tricyclic medications, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], 
combining medications and switching (Fleuren ce, 2009).  STAR*D has shown that augmenting 
early, rather than waiting for treatment failure, increases the li kelihood of remission and 
decreases the chances of relapse (ibid).  Prompt treatment, especially in the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_491333] a more robust response.  Conversely, 
delaying augmentation in patie nts showing resistance to monotherapy has been shown to 
correlate negatively with complete remission and positively with increased chance of relapse, even if complete remission is achieved (Rush, 2007) .   There is, however, a lack of consensus 
among psychiatrists as to what comprises proper, evidence-based treatment for patients with incomplete response, and this is due largely to insufficient data from rigorous studies.  Due to the 
 
RUMC Page 4 of 21 11/29/[ADDRESS_631836] of care for depression (Montgomery, 2006).    Switching medications has been shown to be ef fective treatment strategy in refractory 
depression, as is augmentation, although, obviously, the quality of patient response to the selected initial medication tends to predict whic h of the two second-line treatment approaches 
will be more effective.  That said, generally, patients who initially show an incomplete response have shown better improvement with augmentati on than that seen with switching (Rush, 2007). 
 
Augmentation Options 
The FDA has approved only 2 medications and 1 medicinal food for adjunctive use with ADs in 
patients failing to show adequate response to AD monotherapy: quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  aripi[INVESTIGATOR_34829] L-
methylfolate (ibid).  This governmental approval is consistent with the findings of the STAR*D 
study.  Significantly, STAR*D references fo r augmentation, however , did not include 
antipsychotics, supplements, or stimulant medi cations.  Primarily, data  that does exist for 
stimulant use in treatment of depression suppor ts it as an augmentation rather than as 
monotherapy (Chiarello & Cole , 1987).  (Note: Symby[CONTACT_276200], a combination of fluoxetine and 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], has very recently received a pproval for treatment re sistant depression.) 
 
Of these additional approved medications, arip iprazole has been found to be effective in 
increasing interest and motivation as well as en thusiasm.  Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_491334], however, carry a 
side-effect burden.  In a recent acute study of  aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], 18% of subjects experienced 
akathisia; other common side-e ffects included headache, somnolence, dizziness, restlessness, 
insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, blurred vision and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] 
(Berman, 2009). 
 
The alternative FDA-approved, pharmaceutical, AD- augmenting agent, quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], has been 
shown to improve depressive symptoms, especially insomnia and anxiety. It does, however, also carry a side-effect burden.  Garaka ni, et al. (2009) found weight ch ange, symptoms of dizziness, 
and GI symptoms, the last-mentioned being the onl y side effect to achie ve differentiation from 
placebo.  In extended release que tiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], McIntyre et al. (2009) found sedation, somnolence, 
EPS, weight gain, and an increase in fasting glucose.    
Dopamine and stimulant use in depression 
Common AD medications have fo cused on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5 HT) or norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE) 
although dopamine (DA) is a key endogenous neur otransmitter implicated in regulating mood, 
motivation, one’s level of intere st or pleasure, and other key hallmarks of depression (Dunlop & 
Nemeroff, 2007).  The few randomized controlled tr ials of stimulants’ ef ficacy available consist 
largely of acute, uncontrolled data (Orr & Taylor, 2007).  There are limited reports in the 
literature of TCA monotherapy failure being rectified by [CONTACT_491358] (Wharton, 
1991). 
 
A familiar potentiation strategy is that of TCAs  via methylphenidate (MPH).  Gwitzman (1994) 
found that MPH speeds the effect of TCA response, especially in the firs t and second weeks of 
treatment.  Studies of stimulant augmentation of ADT have been c onducted, but with mixed 
 
RUMC Page 5 of 21 11/29/10 results.  Fawcett, et al (1991) found clinical ly significant results with TRD patients when 
combining pemoline or dextroamphetamine with MAOIs.  SSRIs in combination with MPH or 
dextroamphetamine have been commonly utilized clinically (Shelton, 2010) .  Candy et al (2009) 
reviewed 24 randomized, controlle d trials of five psychostimulants using as monotherapy for 
depression, and found that only 13 of the 24 had “some useable data,” and among these, only 
three demonstrated “oral psychostimulants signifi cantly reduced short-term depressive symptoms 
in comparison with placebo.”  These authors charact erized the quality of th e reviewed studies as 
generally “low.”  Conversely, Fawcett, et al. (199 1) found that a majority (78%) of study patients 
had a good response to at least one stimulant plus a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I).  
Significantly, the authors of this study documented the safety of adjunc tive stimulant medication 
in this population.    Similarly, treatment-resistant depression subjects unresponsive to MAOI monotherapy or to MAOI administered with a TCA did res pond upon the addition of amphetamine or 
methylphenidate (Feighner, et al., 1985).  It is interesting to no te that of the five reviewed 
stimulants, pemoline is no longer available, and modafinil is not, strictly speaking, a 
psychostimulant, but rather, may elevate the release of norep inephrine and dopamine from 
synaptic terminals and elevate hypothalamic histamine levels (Ishizuka, Murakami & 
Yamatodani, 2008).  There is little research eviden ce supporting the use of stimulants as augmenting ADs.  As of 
2007, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of stimulant augmentation for TRD existed 
(Carvahlo, 2007).  Stimulant monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_491335], 
methamphetamine, dexamphetamine, pemoline and modafinil (Candy 2009).  These studies have 
shown positive findings for improvement in aner gia and fatigue symptoms, with only slight 
improvement in mood.  General mood symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_491359][INVESTIGATOR_491336]. Cited concerns included th e short half-life of stimulant medication 
and the risk of abuse of the medication (Carvahlo, 2008).   
 
MPH has been found to successfully augment citalopram in elderly patients; 8 of 10 patients so 
treated showed clinically significant improvement by [CONTACT_5875] 8 (Lavretsky & Kumar, 2001).  In a subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], Lavrets ky et al. found that 5 of 6 pa tients randomized to active 
citalopram and MPH achieved remission (HDRS-24 ≤ 10) compared with none of those in the 
CIT plus placebo group (2006).  C oncordantly, Masand et al. (1998) found in their 7-case series 
that every patient, previously responding only partially to a 2
nd generation AD, achieved a 
marked improvement, especially in apathy and fatigue, when augmented with a stimulant.  
Consistent with these findings, Fleurence, et al. (2009) found in their review of TRD 
augmentation studies that Hamilton and Mont gomery-Asperg symptoms do not generally 
improve with stimulant augmentation, however, CGI scores do improve, as do measures of sleep and energy.  Wagner et al (1997) found that 95% of studied patients (male, HIV positive) who completed at least six weeks of treatment reporte d substantial improvements with regard to both 
mood and energy at a median dosage of 10 mg per day of dextroamphetamine.  Olin and 
Massand (1996) found that 83% of a group of hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_491337]; 73% showed marked or moderate improvement.   
 
 
RUMC Page 6 of 21 11/29/10 Stimulant augmentation of ADs’ particular efficacy 
The few rigorous studies of stimulants’ efficacy available consist primarily of acute, 
uncontrolled data (Orr & Taylor, 2007).  There are a small number of findings in the literature of 
TCA monotherapy failure being successfully augmented by s timulant medication (Wharton, 
1991).Gwitzman (1994) found that, especially in the first and second weeks of treatment, MPH 
speeds the effect of TCA response,  Fawcett, et al (1991) found c linically significant results with 
TRD patients when combining pemoline or dextroamphetamine with MAOIs. It is a common clinical practice to use SSRIs in combinati on with MPH or dextroamphetamine (Shelton, 2010). 
 In elderly patients, methylphenidate has been found to successfully augm ent citalopram; 8 of 10 
patients so treated showed clinically significant improvement, although improvement did not necessarily occur previous to  week 8 (Lavretsky & Kumar, 2001).found that 5 of 6 patients 
randomized to active citalopram and MPH achieved remission of symptoms (HAM-24 ≤ 10) 
compared with none of those randomized to the CIT plus placebo group so remitting (2006).  Concordantly, Masand et al (1998)  found in their 7-case series th at every patient (previously 
responding only partially to a 2
nd generation AD) achieved a marked improvement, and we note, 
especially in the symptoms of apathy and fa tigue, when augmented with a stimulant.(2009) 
found in their review of TRD augmentation stud ies that symptoms rated by [CONTACT_491360], however, CGI scores do 
improve, as do measures of sleep and energy.    Selegiline, an MAO inhibitor, through certain  of its metabolites (L-amphetamine and L-
methamphetamine) is known to increase DA synthesi s.  Feinberg (2004) re views the efficacy of 
augmentation of MAOI ADs with selegiline and proposes the practice may have some clinical 
utility, including in cases of TRD.  The author notes that the availability of transdermal selegiline 
would decrease the potential for abuse of add- on stimulant medication.  Again, further study is 
recommended by [CONTACT_347230].  Ng’s 2009 report of his survey of New Zealand psychogeriatricians finds that stimulants are 
consistently and successfully, if not frequently utilized in that populati on to augment treatment-
resistant cases.  He later el aborated (2009) that such stimulant augmentation improved 
specifically fatigue and apat hy, promoting wakefulness, al ertness, and possible mood 
enhancement.  In a further elaboration, Ng ( 2009) explores whether psychostimulant medication 
may have efficacy among treatment-resistant cas es across a broader demographic.  The above 
findings are consistent with this study’s assertion that depression is usefully conceptualized as a disorder comprised of a constellation of symp tom domains, each domain potentially responding 
best to a particular treatment strategy.  Larger, higher quality trials are commonly r ecommended by [CONTACT_491361], and 
stimulant medication is suggested as deservi ng of serious consideration as a treatment 
alternative, despi[INVESTIGATOR_491338]  (Orr & Taylor, 2007; Parker 
& Brotchie, 2009).  The literature evaluating research on the use of stimulant medications as 
monotherapy or for adjunctive use have consis tently cited the need for larger, randomized-
controlled studies of this tr eatment modality (C andy, 2009; Dunlop & Nemeroff, 2007; Davidson 
& Meltzer-Brody, 1999; Carvahlo, 2008).  
 
RUMC Page 7 of 21 11/29/[ADDRESS_631837] been raised (Orr & Taylor , 2007).  Misuse of stimulant medication is a 
commonly held concern by [CONTACT_491362].  Psychostimulant medications “possess 
significant abuse potential because of their ability  to stimulate brain reward system pathways 
such as [the] mesocorticolimbic dopamine [p athway]…” (Tremblay, 2002).  Lessenger and 
Feinberg (2007) found that, in 2005, prescribed and OTC medications were intentionally 
misused or used for non-medical purposes by 6.[ADDRESS_631838] month.  Of the medication classes examined for abuse, 1.1 million had misused stimulant medications.  Among adults 18-25, the monthly mi suse of prescription drugs increased from 
5.4% to 6.3%.  The authors descri be stimulant medications as bei ng of “particular concern:” in 
2004, there were 7873 American visits to the ER due to non-medical use of stimulant 
medications.  Masand, et al, (1998) found no evidence in thei r case series of drug- seeking, tolerance or 
dependency among their patients augmented with stimulant medication.  Further, our group has 
over 25 years of experience in the use of stimulant medications for affective disorders; we have 
not seen any evidence for an increased risk of abuse potential.    Chronically depressed individuals may, additionally, show a comp ensatory up-regulation of D2 
receptors.  This up-regulation complicates initia l administration of stimulant medication as it 
may account for the “high” some patients experience with stimulants (Dunlop & Nemeroff, 2007).  As depressive physiopathology eases thr ough the initial course of treatment, this up-
regulation normalizes.  
Mechanism of Action 
Based on animal studies and other resear ch methods, possible mechanisms of the 
pathophysiology of depression include reward defic its thought to be caused by [CONTACT_491363].  If th e reward threshold is too high, the patient may 
experience anhedonia, decreased motivation, impaired concentration (Dunlop & Nemeroff, 2007; 
Cryan, 2003).  Diminished DA effect may be cause d by [CONTACT_491364], altered 
intracellular processing, or by a change in the nu mber of post-synaptic receptors.  Dopamine 
operates in the mesocortical (concentration and working memory), mesolimbic (motivation, 
pleasure, reward), nigrostriatal (motor planni ng), tuberoinfundibular (sexual behavior), and 
thalamic regions of the brain.  Impairment in  these systems may especially manifest as a 
decreased ability to work for reward and incr ease in learned helplessn ess (Dunlop & Nemeroff, 
2007).  
 The pathophysiology of MDD consists of “func tional changes in the neurotransmitter and 
neuroendocrine systems, such as the monoamines and the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_491339]-adrenal axis, as 
well as functional neuroanatomical changes in the cingulate, insula, amygdala, basal ganglia, 
caudate, and frontal, prefrontal, parietal, and temporal lobes” Tremblay (2002).  The author 
noted a marked positive correlation between  depression severity and “degree of 
dextroamphetamine [reward] effects.”  “Patients who were more depressed (Hamilton equals greater than 23) experience a grea ter degree of rewarding effects, whereas patients with moderate 
depression did not differentiate from controls (Tremblay, 2002). 
 
 
RUMC Page 8 of 21 11/29/10 It is commonly held that stimulant medicati ons (eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate, pemoline) 
have mood-elevating effects.  Amphetamine, for example, is primarily an indirect-action 
sympathomimetic agent with certain direct agonist  properties, which are achieved through direct 
neuronal release of DA and NE; blockade of  catecholamine reuptake and weak monoamine 
oxidase inhibition (Biel & Bopp, 1978) .  Alternatively, methylphenidate  is similar, structurally 
and mechanistically to amphetamine and pemo line is hypothesized to augment catecholamine 
transmission (Chiarello & Cole , 1987).  AMPH designates an a-methyl-phenmethyl-amine motif.  
“J.H. Biel and B.A. Bopp (1978) state the defini tive structural features  of AMPH as (1) an 
unsubstituted phenyl ring, (2) a two-carbon side chain between the pheny l ring and nitrogen, (3) 
an a-methyl group, and (4) a primary amino group” (Sulzer, 2005).    Amphetamine refers to the class of drugs that  predominantly releases catecholamines by a non-
exocytic mechanism.  Amphetamines elevate ex tra-cellular levels of  catecholamines and 
serotonin.  Amphetamines have been utilized by  [CONTACT_491365].  B-phenethylamine, phenylethanolamine, tyrosine, and 
tryptamine are formed in the peripheral nervous systems and the brain.  These aromatic amino acid metabolites may modulate behaviors such as excitement and alertness (Sulzer et al, 2005). 
 There is evidence for multiple sites of acti on by [CONTACT_491366].  
AMPH has also been suggested to induce CNS d opamine release.  AMPH is supposed to act on 
membrane transporters and so to aid in dopamine synthesis, and modulate monoamine 
availability in both the cytosol and in synaptic vesicles. and the cytosol,  and also to aid in 
dopamine synthesis.  The effect of AMPH on vesi cles is unclear.  Stimulants generally create 
dopamine release in the striatum (Sutzer, 2005).  Dopamine is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of depression, either through dimi nished presynaptic DA release, or through 
changes in number or function of post-synaptic receptors (Dunlop & Nemeroff, 2007).  
Amphetamines act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors  and have “effects on plasma membrane and 
vesicular transporters to increase the quantit y of biogenic amines available for release by 
[CONTACT_61670] [monoamine oxidase ]” (Sulzer et al 2005). 
 
Defects in the underlying “brain reward system may underlie specific and core symptoms of depression such as loss of pleasure or interest.”  The brain reward system consists of “extensive 
pathways that mediate behavioral components of  reward such as pleasure and motivation.”  
Brain reward system studies in humans have pointed  to this circuit’s involvement in the reward-
activities of psychoactive com pounds such as of cocaine, nicotine and dextroamphetamine 
(Tremblay, 2002).  “AMPH has long been noted to enhance dopamine synt hesis, and this provides an important role 
in its action under some conditions.”  (Sulzer et al 2005).  Wharton (1991) found 
methylphenidate “appears to invol ve an increase in the blood le vels of antidepressants through 
enzymatic inhibition of the metabolism of imipramine,” as does methyl imipramine, which increase is concomitant with clinical improvement.  According to David Mrazek (2010), dopamine tran sport is modulated by [CONTACT_491367]6A3 gene, the 
dopamine transporter gene, known as DAT or DAT1.  This gene “produces a protein that transfer 
dopamine from the synapse back to the neuron” ( p. 125).  This is important because reuptake of 
 
RUMC Page 9 of 21 11/29/10 DA back into the neuron switches off DA stimulation in the synapse.  Variations in this gene 
may be implicated in disorders such as “ADHD, binge eating, depression,  bipolar disorder, and 
alcoholism (Mrazek, 2010, p. 125).  Mrazek also addresses the DRD4 DA receptor gene and the D4 DA receptor.  This receptor is 
“located predominantly in the prefrontal cortex ” (p. 207).  Variations in the density of D4 
receptor in the PFC have been implicated in dise ases such as Parkinson’s and schizophrenia.  
Mutations in the DRD4 gene have also been implicated in ADHD (2010).  For all the limitations 
in study methodology and other design factors determining study significance, sufficient 
evidence clearly exists, both clinically and scientifically, supporting the ne ed for further inquiry 
into to the use of DA modulating (stimulant) me dications in mood disord ers; specifically, in 
treatment-resistant depression.  Primary Objective:  Generate evidence-based data on the efficacy, safety and tolerability of

The treatment phase of the study consists of 2 ph ases (21 treatment days per phase).  Study Phase 
[ADDRESS_631845] of visits 2 (basel ine) through 5.  Study Phase [ADDRESS_631846] of visits 6 through 8.  
There will be a follow-up visit 2 weeks following visit 8.  There is a one-week interval between 
study visits, with a scheduling window of +/- 3 days allowed.  Mixed salts amphetamine is FDA-approved for Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and superior in efficacy  to placebo; therefore, como rbid ADHD will be statistically 
controlled as a continuously-variable covariate,  but will not be considered an exclusionary 
condition.   
 
The primary analysis will be a repeated measures analysis of variance using a mixed-effects 
model (PROC MIXED-MMRM). The primary outcome  measure will be the MGH-CPFQ total 
score at baseline and the MGH-CPFQ total score at the end of the trial.  The independent 
variables will be the study visit, the treatment in the previous phase, and treatment assignment. 
The variance covariance matrix for the repeated measures will be unspecified.  
 
Enrollment Period:   The enrollment period is estimated to  be [ADDRESS_631847] patient is 
expected to complete the study by [CONTACT_11711] 31, 2010. 
 Number of Subjects:  40 subjects will be randomized (20 to each treatment arm).  Additional subjects may be consented to allow for screen failures.  Subjects who terminate early post-randomization will be replaced only sufficiently to ensure a total number of 24 (12 to each 
treatment arm) evaluable subjects.  Duration of Subjects' Study Participation:   There will be a total of 9 study visits over a period 
of 9 weeks.

Study Procedures:  Figure [ADDRESS_631848] signs the informed consent document.    
 
 
RUMC Page 13 of 21 11/29/10  Screen visit (Visit 1):   Medical and psychiatric history will  be taken, a physical examination and 
vital signs will be performed and lab tests done.  Lab tests include CBC, CMP, urine drug screen 
and urine pregnancy test for females of childbear ing potential.  If a subj ect has had the required 
lab tests performed within the past 3 months and can produce the re sults, lab procedures may be 
waived at the screening visit for that patient (except urine pregnancy test).  The HDRS-17 score 
upon screening will be used to determine entry elig ibility (see inclusion criteria).  Beyond the 
patient’s verbal report, we will attempt to obt ain medical records (e.g., previous clinician or 
pharmacy records) to document adequate dose and duration of previous/current ADT. 
 
 Study Phase 1  
Baseline visit (Visit 2):   Screened and eligible subjects will return one week after the screening 
visit.  At this visit (provided entry criteria continue to be met) subjects will be randomized in 
double-blind fashion to one of two treatment groups:  
o Group 1:  MSA duri ng both phases; or 
o Group 2:  PBO during Phase [ADDRESS_631849] until the next study visit 
(7 days +/- 3).    Study visits 3-5:   Following the baseline visit, subjects will return at one-week intervals for study 
visits 3-5.  Study procedures to be performed ar e reflected in Figure 3.  Phase 2 study drug is 
dispensed at study visit 5.  Study visits 6-8:   Subjects will return at one-week intervals for study visits 6-8.  Study 
procedures to be performed are reflected in Figure 3.  At visit 8, all subjects will receive 
instructions for tapering the dose of the MSA to avoid potential difficulties from abrupt 
discontinuation of the study drug.    Study visit 9:  Subjects will return two weeks followi ng visit [ADDRESS_631850] withdraws or is term inated early from the study, visit 9 procedures will be performed 
at the final study visit.  All concomitant medications taken during the stu dy will be recorded in the case report form, 
along with dosage information and start and stop  dates.  Subjects requiring excluded drugs will 
be discontinued from the study.  Medication manage ment and clinical rati ngs will be performed 
by [CONTACT_58686].  Subjects who complete the trial will be offered re ferrals to qualified phys icians for the purposes 
of continued care.  At the conclusion of Visit 8, study blind will be removed by [CONTACT_491371]’s selected follow-up care 
provider.  At Visit 8, study subjects will be provided a one-month prescription for the dose of 
MSA they are currently prescribed in the st udy to ease transition to their follow-up care 
physician. 
 
RUMC Page 14 of 21 11/29/[ADDRESS_631851](s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with 
Investigational Product(s):   Based upon clinical judgment and ascertained between clinician 
and patient, study drug will be dosed as follows: The total daily dosage of study drug will be 5-
60 mg, supplied in 5 and 10 mg tabl ets of MSA or matching PBO.   
 Total daily dosing of the concurrent ADT will be as follows: escitalopram 10-40 mg; fluoxetine 20-80 mg;  paroxetine CR 25-100 mg (paroxetine 20- 80 mg may be substituted if paroxetine CR 
is not available); sertraline  100-400 mg; venlafaxine XR 150-600 mg; desvenlafaxine 50-200mg; 
citalopram 20-80 mg; or duloxetine 60-180 mg ; bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 150-450 mg; mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 15-45 mg, 
tricyclics (standard dosing, individually per label instructions). 
 The dose of MSA begins at 5mg BID.  MSA dose range will be 5mg-20mg  BID or TID, not to 
exceed 60mg per day in addition to the stable  dose of ongoing ADT.  Each study medication 
tablet will be [ADDRESS_631852] titration will be based upon physician’s 
clinical judgment and confir med by [CONTACT_4676]’s consent.  
  Subjects unable to tolerate the study medications  will be withdrawn from the study. Every effort 
will be made to encourage patients to comply with this dosage regimen and to take all study 
medications and their ongoing concomitant ADT as instructed. All patients will be instructed to 
return any excess medication at each visit. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_491343]. Protocol violation will be defined as less than 80% compliance by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_692]. 
 
MSA doses will be custom-tapered per physician’s discretion starting at visit 8. 
 The study medication packager will use a block randomization scheme to distribute the kits 
within each box/block.    Risk/Safety Information:  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_491344].  The investigator is also responsible to follow, through an 
appropriate health care option, adverse events th at are serious or that caused the subject to 
discontinue before completing the study.  The subj ect should be followed until the event resolves 
or is explained.  Frequency of follow-up is left to the discretion of  the investigator.   
 
Monitoring and Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events: 
 
Adverse Events:
 
All observed or volunteered adverse events, regardless of suspected causal relationship to study 
drug, will be recorded on the case report form an d reported to the IRB if  reporting criteria are 
met.    
 
RUMC Page 15 of 21 11/29/10 Serious and/or Unexpected Adverse Events:  
Study site personnel will report to the IRB a ny serious and/or unexpected adverse event 
following IRB reporting guidelines.  A serious a dverse event is any adverse experience that 
results in one of the following outcomes,  or is significant for any other reason: 
 
• Death 
• Initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• A life-threatening experience (tha t is, immediate risk of dying) 
• Severe or permanent disability 
• Cancer 
• Congenital anomaly 
 
Serious adverse events occurring after a subjec t is discontinued from the study will not be 
reported unless the investigator f eels that the event may have b een caused by [CONTACT_13462] a 
protocol procedure.  
Unblinding Procedure 
Unblinding may be performed only by [CONTACT_18456] d site personnel, under two conditions: 
• If necessary for treatment of the subject in the even t of a medical emergency 
• Upon a subject's completion of the study (visit 8), in order to facili tate continuation of 
care by a non-study clinician 
 
Monitoring of Study/Oversight: 
Study staff will monitor source data and case report forms by [CONTACT_491372].  . 
 
IRB Review/Ethical Conduct of Study: 
IRB Review:  Prior to enrolling any subjects, documen tation will be obtained that the study 
protocol and informed consent form have been approved by [CONTACT_491373].  Any change in the protocol or informed consent form will require 
prior written approval except to prev ent injury or risk to a subject. 
 Regulatory Considerations:  This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical 
principles stated in the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki or the applicable 
guidelines on good clinical practice, whicheve r represents the grea ter protection of the 
individual. 
 Informed Consent:  The informed consent document, in conjunction with verbal discussion of the 
protocol, will be used to explain the study, including the risk s and benefits, to the subject in 
simple terms before the subject is  entered into the study.  The investigator is responsible to see 
that informed consent is obtained from each subject and to obtain the appropriate signatures and dates on the informed consent document prior to th e performance of any protocol procedures and 
prior to any changes made to a subject’s medi cal treatment plan for the purpose of study 
participation.  The original signed consen t form will be retained by [CONTACT_093]. 
   
 
RUMC Page 16 of 21 11/29/10 Confidentiality: 
All information collected about subjects for th e purposes of this st udy will be treated as 
confidential to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_2371].  The information obtained while subjects are enrolled 
in this study, including all study-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_491148], will be made available to the 
study doctor, Bristol-Myers Squibb, the Institu tional Review Board and other regulatory 
agencies, including the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administrati on (U.S. FDA).   
 
Intended Use of Data: 
The results of this research project may be pres ented at meetings or in publications, but the 
identity of subjects will not be di sclosed in such presentations. 
 
Statistical Analysis:         
Study Assessments and Primary Endpoints: The difference in absolute change in score from 
baseline to endpoint in the MGH-CPFQ between the MSA and the PBO groups is the primary 
endpoint.  Key secondary endpoints will be differe nce in absolute change from baseline in 
MADRS score between MSA and PBO, differen ce in remission rates (MADRS < 11) between 
MSA and PBO, the change from baseline in tota l score at endpoint of MGH-CPFQ item analysis, 
difference in change scores on the CGI-S, CGI-I and QIDS.  Safety outcome measures: adverse 
events, physical examinations, vital signs; blood pressure, orthostatic; EKG; Rush Sexual Inventory (RSI).                    Statistical Methods:  The randomized sample includes all patients who are randomized.  The 
Safety sample will include those randomized pa tients who received at least one dose of double-
blind study medication as indicated on the dosing record. The efficacy sample will include those 
patients in the safety sample who have at l east one efficacy evaluati on post-randomization.  The 
last observation carried forward (L OCF) data set includes data r ecorded at a given visit after 
randomization, or, if no observation is recorded at  that visit, data carried forward from the 
previous postrandomization visit. The LOCF data set is primary, and analysis of the observed case data set also will be conducted.                  The primary analysis will compare pooled M GH-CPFQ response rates between PBO and MSA 
and PBO non-responders.  Differences in respon se rates will be compared using the CMH 
General Association Test.  Descriptive sta tistics on non-primary groups will be conducted. 
 This study seeks to estimate the strength of any statistically si gnificant relationship, or effect 
size, in addition to stat istical significance of found treatment effects.   
 Secondary Endpoints Analysis:  Differences in remission (defin ed as an endpoint MADRS score 
<11) rates will be compared using the CMH General Association Test.  Logistic regression analysis will be performed to explore the relationship between response and patients’ 
demographics and prognostic variab les including baseline QIDS score,  gender, site, and age, etc.  
Similar analyses will be performed for remission.

 4 STUDY SUMMARY  
 
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most common substance use disorder s. Yet 
only a small fraction of people who need treatment receive it, and most of them get only short -term support even though continuing care has been shown to be much more 
effecti ve. Partner support can be critical to recovery, but many partners do not know 
how to support their partners’ recovery or manage their own responses to it. Clinicians also lack evidence of the efforts patients are making toward recovery. Treating couples in which one member is recovering from AUD has been shown to be efficacious; in 
particular, Alcohol Behavioral Couples Therapy (ABCT) has shown positive outcomes. Still, ABCT has not been widely a dopted, in part because of practical problems  such as 
the stigma that goes with the partner needing to go to an addiction treatment agency to participate. A -CHESS is a smartphone -based system proven to substantially reduce 
relapse rates , but A -CHESS serves only the patient.  
 This project will develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a new smartphone- based system for AUD 
patients, their partners, and clinicians called PartnerCHESS. PartnerCHESS will integrate key features of ABCT and A -CHESS. The project has three specific aims:  
 1. Integrate A -CHESS with key features o f ABCT to create PartnerCHESS to serve 
patients, partners, and clinicians.  
2. Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] (a small randomized clinical trial) of PartnerCHESS to estimate effect size and refine the protocol, procedures, recruitment strategy, measurements, 
and operations we would use in a large RCT.  
3a. Decide whether to pursue an R01 application, and if so, 3b. plan for the R01.  
 The project would engage [ADDRESS_179107] em would be tested by 34 other couples 
randomized to receive either PartnerCHESS + treatment as usual (TAU) or A -CHESS + 
TAU for a 6- month trial. We will collect survey data at baseline, 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_179108] of AUD treatment in general and couples therapy in particular . 
  1.0 BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE  
 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) has a lifetime prevalence of 29.1% in adults 18 and older.
2  
In 2014, 1.5 million adults sought treatment in an addiction specialty treatment program for AUD.
3 While treatment can be effective, its short term leads to high relapse rates; as 
many as 50% of treated patients return to problem use within a year.[ADDRESS_179109]. At set -up, 
patient -specific information is entered into the app, such as the patient’s triggers, 
therapeutic goals, and healthy activities of interest. The system includes emergency contacts (to use when the patient is at immediate risk of relapse) and nonemergency resources (e.g., social support through discussion groups, weekly check -ins that lead to 
information on copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]). If a patient nears a high- risk location (a bar s he used to 
frequent), the GPS initiates asking the patient if she wants to be there. A -CHESS also 
includes —with patient permission —a report to the patient’s counselor if weekly check -in 
responses signal a need for intervention. A -CHESS was tested in a large NIAAA- funded 
randomized trial.
1  
 Partner support can help prevent relapse because alcohol problems and intimate relationships are reciprocally related. Distress in the relationship, along with partner attempts to control patient substance use, may prompt craving and trigger relapse; 
alcohol use is associated with greater relationship conflict.
22 Recovery destabilizes 
relationships. New patterns of interacting need to be negotiated to support each 
partner’s needs.23 Yet many partners do not know how to support recovery or manage 
their own responses to their partner’s changed behavior and symptoms of post -acute 
withdrawal, such as irritability.[ADDRESS_179110]. They may need help too.30-
32 Couples treatment has shown efficacy for AUD outcomes; in particular, Alcohol 
Behavioral Couples Therapy (ABCT) has demonstrated positive outcomes for men and women with  AUD.

complementary, interconnected versions – one each for patient  and partner . 
PartnerCHESS will be designed to help prevent patient relapse and help both the patient and partner use copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], monitoring, and social support interventions in real time as they face triggers, cravings, and conflict. Compared with existing counseling 
  
 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_179112] the potential to provide services to more people, 
more often, for a longer period of time, with greater reach to a patient’s social support 
systems. Furthermore, being able to receive help without attending 12- step meetings 
and sessions at the clinic can reduce stigma.  
  2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 Specific Aim 1: Integrate A -CHESS with key features of ABCT to create PartnerCHESS to serve 
patients  and partners . 
 Specific Aim 2:  
Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] (a small RCT) of PartnerCHESS to examine feasibility and refine the protocol,  procedures, recruitment strategy, measurements, and operations we would 
use in a large RCT.  
 This R34 will help us prepare a subsequent R01 by [CONTACT_154763], estimate effect sizes, collect data, finalize our analytical protocol, and create an operational  manual.  
 Study Coordination  
The UW -Madison Center for Health Enhancement Systems Studies (CHESS) is the 
coordinating site for this study. The UW study coordinator will oversee all activities at 
the recruitment site which includes :  
• developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] s ite specific recruitment and data collec tion processes  that meet 
study objectives ; 
• training site staff on protocol procedures prior to start of recruitment and continuous monitoring to assure compliance with the protocol and human subjects regulation; 
• communicating with site staff via weekly conference calls  to monitor progress , 
inform of protocol changes/ distribute new version of protocol , and address 
unanticipated issues  or challenges ; 
• and manage all study data.  
  3.0 ELIGIBILITY  
 Patients and Partners: A total of 40 dyads  will be  recruited from the community and 
outpatient treatment programs in Fall River, MA ( Stanley Street Treatment and 
Resources  – SSTAR)  and Madison, WI (UW Behavioral Health & Recovery).  
 Patients and partners  must : 
• M ust be 18 or older  
• N ot have a mental or physical condition that limits smartphone use  
  
 
 
 
 7 • Not r eport fear of being involved in PartnerCHESS or fear that their partner would 
hurt them physically or emotionally for being involved in PartnerCHESS  
• Not have a history of schizophrenia 
 
Patients : 
• M ust have a DSM -5 diagnosis of alcohol use disorder  or meet NIAAA guidelines 
for risky drinking.  
• Have had at least one alcoholic drink in the last 3 months   
 
Partners :  
• M ust be a spouse, or in a 6- month or longer committed romantic relationship  
• Willing to participate in the study  
 
4.[ADDRESS_179113]. The consent 
process will be the same although the consent form itself will be different between the 
two groups.  
 Community Recruitment: Recruitment targeting the general community  in Fall River, MA 
and Madison, WI will be done by [CONTACT_154764]/Craiglist ads, flyers, and internal 
staff/faculty email s. 
 Outpatient Treatment Recruitment: SSTAR and UW Behavioral Health & Recovery staff 
will use medical records and client intake forms to identify and prescreen patients based on the eligibility criteria outlined in section 3.0.  After potentially eligible subjects are identified (via a phone call from the patient/partner 
regarding one of the community recruitment strategies or outpatient treatment staff) , the 
research staff will explain the study and its benefits and risks via the phone. If the 
patient/partner  is intere sted and believes their  partner would be willing to learn more, 
research staff will screen the patient /partner  for eligibility  and discuss the options for 
talking with their partner - 1) if available, talk to the patient/partner on the phone directly 
following screening of the first member of the dyad, 2) provide research staff phone number for patient/partner to call when convenient, or 3) mail /email/text  the Opt -in 
Letter (Partner Letter) which they can review and return if interested giving research 
staff permission to call and convenient times.  Once the research staff has talked with 
both the patient and partner and they are eligible and interested, the consent forms and 
study information sheets  will be mailed, emailed, or texted, whichever  method the 
participants prefer. Staff will also mail the baseline surveys and a set of calendars as 
part of the survey instrument that will be administered on their  first study call . At the first 
study call  staff will go over the consent forms in detail, verbal informed consent will be 
documented, baseline surveys  will be conducted, participants will be randomized, and 
  
 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_179114] to visit the clinic at all (even phone delivery can be provided at a more convenient location). Hence the incentive is high and the stigma in participating is low. If either the patient or the partner declines, the dyad will be excluded. To help us prepare for an R01, we will measure the number and percent of patients who are eligible and accept, the number and percent of partners who accept, and the number of dyads that join. We will document reasons for any refusal and monitor whether refusal rates differ by [CONTACT_154765], race, and age. Based on the results, the recruitment process for the R01 may need to change. We will note whether partners are of the opposite or same sex. To avoid coercion, SSTAR will be paid on a fixed- price contract rather than a per -couple-
recruited basis.   
 Patient Randomization: The [ADDRESS_179115] a dropout rate of about 10%, leaving about [ADDRESS_179116] the PartnerCHESS app. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_154742] 3 
focus groups include:  • Initial design feedback  
• Mock -ups feedback  
• Content feedback  
• Usability testing  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]  
• Review and give feedback on surveys to be used during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]

During the development phase the PartnerCHESS software design team will develop a series of interface prototypes and use rapid- cycle testing to gather user feedback about 
them. We will ask questions such as how intuitive the system is (Can people find what 
they are looking for? Do the graphics and naming conventions make sense?), how visually appealing it is, and whether the services seem useful. We will use tools such as wirefra mes, mockups, and paper and html prototypes to test prototypes, use feedback 
to quickly make changes, and test again. The information gathered from the [ADDRESS_179117] begins. Our baseline and follow -up surveys will also be tested with the 6 
dyads. Study participants will receive $35 for each focus group they attend for a 
maximum of $105.  
 Approximately [ADDRESS_179118] a smartphone we will pay them $[ADDRESS_179119] their phone service.  
 We will improve our  predictive analytic service in A -CHESS based on our research 
indicating that real -time linguistic analysis (LIWC)
[ADDRESS_179120] relapse. Our analyses of A -CHESS data found that some patterns of 
partic ipants’ word use in the discussion group (i.e., an increase in swear words) 
signaled impending relapse (R2=.40). For A -CHESS and PartnerCHESS, we propose 
modifying the analysis program so that it immediately identifies such patterns, allowing us to push tailored interventions right away. (This analysis currently occurs off line. The innovation is to make it work in real time.) Once the predictive analytic has been improved, the [ADDRESS_179121] it  and revisions will be 
made based on their feedback during the focus groups.   
 6-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] A -CHESS services. Patients randomized to the A -CHESS group will 
receive the A -CHESS app on a smartphone.  A -CHESS services are:  
 Instant Library. FAQs and brief information on addiction and couples -r
 elated issues, 
e.g., taking care of yourself, financial matters, alcohol abuse overview, crisis intervention, referral, medications.  
Discussion groups . Forum
 s connect patients or partners with others. Posts are analyzed 
to predict relapse.  
Personal stories. A udio of both patients and partners talking about experiences dealing 
with addiction.  
Location monitor (optional ). Geo -fencing of areas identified as triggers (e.g., a bar that 
was frequented), which prompts a warning followed by [CONTACT_154766]. If the patient stays in the area, a recorded message encourages him or her to leave. If the patient doesn’t leave, a support person is automatically notified.  
  
 
 
 
 10 Surveys/EMAs . Questions assess immediate needs and trends over time. Partners wil l 
be asked about their own status and their perspectives on the patient’s status. Advice or 
referrals to other A -CHESS or PartnerCHESS services will arise from responses to 
questions as well as from the Bayesian prediction of relapse risk using data from discussion groups and surveys.
41  
Guided relaxation.  Audio to guide mindfulness, relaxation exercises, games, and other 
help for cravings.  
Meeting locator. P atients and partners can use GPS to find AA/Al Anon meetings. 
Smartphone GPS data enable clinicians to estimate treatment adherence, e.g., attending 12- step meetings or other appointments.  
Healthy activities . Dat
 abase of ideas (e.g., taking a walk) and local recovery -friendly 
activities. Couples can add them to their recovery calendar.  
Crisis button . R elaxation exercises, optional  calls to supporters, games for distraction, 
and other resources.  
Skills reminder s. Ti ps and reminders of CBT- based skills (e.g., effective communication, 
refusal skills, etc.)  
 
6-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_154743].  Patients randomized to the 
PartnerCHESS group will receive all A- CHESS services listed above, plus the followi ng 
services from ABCT:  
 Urge discussion. Daily EMAs will track preconditions for relapse (urges), review urge 
reduction options on PartnerCHESS, and encourage discussions between partners on the causes of and ways to reduce urges.   
Homework checklist . Track
 s which interventions the couple is using/practicing, along 
with resources to help.  
Relapse plan. Monitoring and reminders of steps planned for relapse prevention.  
Reminders . Reminders to notice something positive in partner, of reasons to stay sober, 
to take meds, etc.  
Trigger identification and removal . Dur ing set -up, patient and partner enter triggers. 
PartnerCHESS will quiz couples on upcoming trigger events and remind them of ways 
to address each.   
 C
onceptual model of study.  Figure 1 shows the conceptual model we propose to 
study. It suggests that PartnerCHESS and A -CHESS 
will improve the secondary outcomes both directly and through multiple meditational paths. Changes in secondary outcomes (e.g., sleep
58) will improve 
the primary outcomes. We anticipate that PartnerCHESS will (more than A -CHESS 
alone) affect the patient’s intrinsic motivation to abstain as well as his or her relatedness 

  
 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_179122] 
outcomes both directly (by [CONTACT_154767]’s secondary outcomes) and by [CONTACT_154768] (and vice versa). For example, if PartnerCHESS boosts the partner’s feelings of relatedness, the patient’s feelings of relatedness may increase as a result.
[ADDRESS_179123] effects of PartnerCHESS on both mediators and secondary outcomes (i.e., women – partners or patients – will use dis cussion groups 
more and will benefit more). Similar expectations hold for patients assigned to A -
CHESS, except that the partner will not be directly affected by A -CHESS since the 
partner does not have access to it. However, partners may be indirectly affected by [CONTACT_154769] A -CHESS makes in patients. Finally, we anticipate that the extent to which 
partners PartnerCHESS will affect mediation and secondary outcomes.   
 Inclusion of sex as a moderator variable. We will examine how men and women use the interventions differently and how the interventions affect them differently.   Comparison group and TAU. Appropriate comparison groups are a hotly debated 
topic.
63-[ADDRESS_179124], but our 
concerns about the lack of equipoise and the need for the comparison arm to offer some proven benefit (as A -CHESS does) led us to propose comparing 
PartnerCHESS+TAU to A- CHESS+TAU rat her than comparing PartnerCHESS+TAU to 
TAU alone.  
 Treatment as Usual (TAU).
 At our recruitment site (SSTAR), TAU involves all patients 
learning core CBT skills. Patients receive training in anger and depression management, communication skills, distress tolerance, enjoying recovery, maintaining sobriety, parenting, problem solving, relapse prevention, seeking safety, and setting weekly objectives. A -CHESS and PartnerCHESS will prompt patients to use – and how 
to use – the skills that SSTAR teaches. SSTAR u ses a fidelity scale to ensure that 
trainers teach the required skills, and we will use it to ensure that our services remind participants of the same skills.  
 Data collection. The 34 dyads  will use the technologies for 6 months. Daily, 
PartnerCHESS will t rack triggers, relationship satisfaction, substance use, and cravings. 
Weekly, it will track the homework couples are doing; every [ADDRESS_179125] survey s over the phone. While 
partners of A -CHESS patients will not receive software, they will be survey ed. Each 
patient and partner  in the PartnerCHESS group and patients in the A -CHESS group will 
receive $20 for each completed survey . Partners in the A -CHESS group will receive $[ADDRESS_179126] a smartphone, they will be paid 
$[ADDRESS_179127] a smartphone, they will be given one with paid service for 6 
  
 
 
 
 12 months.  As appropriate, participants will provide feedback about what is helpful in the 
system and changes they would make. SSTAR will provide retention data.  
 
App use data will be automatically collected by [CONTACT_154770] “cookies” on smartphones (with participants’ consent) when randomization takes place. Data are stored on a central server, maintained by [CONTACT_77504] -Madison Division of Information 
Technology  (DoIT),  for protection in case of phone loss. Remaining data will come from 
patient survey s and be entered into REDCap, a secure, web- based application 
designed to support data management for research. After baseline data collection, survey s will omit stable dat a. UW s taff will periodically call participants to promote 
system use and response to assessments. The timing of survey s will be based on 
enrollment date. The payment we selected is consistent with what we have used successfully in earlier studies .  
 Qualitative data and analysis.  The baseline, 2, 4, and 6- month surveys will also 
collect qualitative data to help us further refine our interventions, the study design, and protocol. Seven issues will be addressed, tailored to whether the interviewee is a partner or patient and their study arm. Assuming the questions were asked of a patient assigned to PartnerCHESS: (1) What impact do you think PartnerCHESS has on your risky drinking and why? (2) What impact has it had on your relationship with your partner? (3) How easy was it to use the technology? What would make it easier? (4) How can we make the technology better? (5) Looking back on the study, what should have gone more smoothly (introduction, training, data collection, phone performance, 
etc.)? Be as specific as possible. (6) Suppose we could make only one change to the 
study, what should it be? (7) What do you like best/least about the technology? Non-duplicated lists of answers will be created and we will track the number of times each response is noted. Survey  data will be double coded with deviations, if found, resolved. 
Importance will be estimated by [CONTACT_154771]. Using that and our own judgments to set priorities, we will improve the technologies and the study design.  
 
Continuing development. Once the pi[INVESTIGATOR_154744], we will analyze use data every [ADDRESS_179128] accessed, and differences in patterns of use between patients and partners. One of the tools for patients within A -
CHE SS and PartnerCHESS will be a weekly survey adapted from the Brief Alcohol 
Monitor (BAM).[ADDRESS_179129] relapse; responses help CHESS systems tailor services to pat ients. During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087], we will add 2 questions to the weekly survey 
that ask participants what they like and don’t like about their system and its services. We will also add questions to the 2,  4, and 6 month survey s. These questions will 
change over time as we explore specific issues and services. If a service is not used for a month, we will add a question on the PartnerCHESS survey about why it isn’t used. If certain services are used a great deal, we will ask users to describe what they are getting from the service. In this way, we can continue to learn about and act on what is 
helpful and not helpful in a more immediate way than just from the survey s. 
Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_154745]. Other CHESS studies have done 4 things to 
  
 
 
 
 13 increase engagement. We will use all 4: (1) Monitor and respond to changes in amount 
of CHESS use. (2) Examine discussion group posts using tools such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)[ADDRESS_179130] worrisome language. (3) Use EMAs and weekly check- in data to identify disconcerting trends. These indicators lead 
to gentle interventions from our research staff (e.g., a call to ask how the person is doing) and referrals to relevant CHESS services, such as games and customized tips to address concerns, e.g., poor sleep. In this R34, we will enhance our inventory of games, especially ones that can be played by [CONTACT_154772]. (4) Regularly refresh the interventions with new information and resources so people keep coming back.  
Dissolution of the relationship.  If a partner and patient separate, we will encourage 
both to continue using the technology and completing surveys. At the request of patient or partner, we will disengage the portions of PartnerCHESS that connect the two of them. If the partner is willin g to continue in the study and act as a support for the patient 
via technology, we will keep the partner in the study.  If the separated partner prefers to 
not stay involved, we will honor that request. These experiences (if they occur) will help 
us better  understand relationships during recovery and plan PartnerCHESS 
modifications that account for the level of relationship dissolution or the possibility of repeated break -ups and reconciliations that may occur.  
Privacy and Confidentiality:  
To mitigate the risk of patient breaches of confidentiality, all subjects will be assigned a code number. A list of subject code numbers will be maintained by [CONTACT_154773] a password protected spreadsheet. Participant surveys will be identified by [CONTACT_120467]. The UW and SSTAR study coordinator s will assist 
patient subjects in choosing codenames and passwords to use to login to the A -CHESS 
or Partner -CHESS system. Patients will be instructed not to use their real names as a 
codename [CONTACT_154798] (e.g. real names or telephone numbers).  
Prior to gaining access to our data, all students, faculty and staff must provide our Data Security Officer a copy of their certificates of completion of the UW Madison Human Subjects online training and the online HIPAA Privacy Rule training. Furthermore, they are required to complete training on Center security procedures and policies and sign a Center Data Security Policy Certification upon completion of this training.  
Hard copy data, such as surveys, will not contain identifying information. They will be stored in a locked file cabinet in the study coordinators private office. Electronic data, such as A -CHESS or PartnerCHESS use data, will be stored on a secure UW -Madison 
DoIt serverl. Access to this data will be limited by [CONTACT_154774]- in. Paper study data, such as surveys and contact [CONTACT_3031], will be 
entered into a REDCap system managed by [CONTACT_154775].  
Hard copy data at SSTAR  and UW, intake and consent forms, will be stored in a locked 
file cabinet within the private office of the site coordinator. UMass will not house any data, electronic or paper.  
Any data stored on a participant's device are stored in an encrypted file and only accessible by [CONTACT_154776], i.e. participants won't have any other participant data on 
  
 
 
 
 14 their phone. These data are only collected after the participant has signed into their 
account and are removed when the participant signs out of the A -
CHESS/PartnerCHESS application. Any data transferred to and from CHESS servers are done through an encrypted connection.  
A list of subject code numbers will be maintained by [CONTACT_154777]. This data will be kept in a secure, limited access, password- protected file on CHESS servers which are located in the department of 
Systems and Industrial Engineering in the Mechanical Engineering building on the 4th floor.  
The study coordinator  will be the only person with access to both the coded study data 
and the subject identifiers .  
When all study activities are complete identifiable information will be destroyed. De-identified study data will be stored on the secure CHESS servers for potential future unspecified research for which new IRB submissions will be initiated.     
 Potential Risks:  
Regarding risk of misinterpretation of information: Information and resources on the A -
CHESS/PartnerCHESS app will be screened by [CONTACT_154778]  ([CONTACT_154802], [CONTACT_10785] and [CONTACT_69331]) for 
accuracy .  Additionally, messages exchanged within A -CHESS/PartnerCHESS will be 
monitored to make sure the information is accurate and that study participants are using the system for its intended purpose. Inaccurate or harmful statements will be addressed by [CONTACT_154779].  
Possible breach of confidentiality: All subjects will be assigned a blind code number  that 
will be kept in a locked file in the CHESS office. Data collecte d from clinic records and 
smartphone use files will have the name [CONTACT_154799] [CONTACT_9137].   
Possible break of confidentiality in surveys : Survey s will be conducted by [CONTACT_154780]. Project staff who have access to the data will not have access to subject names.  
Possible bre ach of confidentiality in smartphone use: There is a risk that information 
provided on A -CHESS or PartnerCHESS will be used to the detriment of the subjects. 
Particular sources of risk include A -CHESS or PartnerCHESS messages written within 
the discussion groups or personal profiles. Patients will select code names and passwords to use on A -CHESS/PartnerCHESS . They will be instructed to not use their 
real name [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a code name [CONTACT_154800] (e.g. real names or telephone numbers). The smartphone will automatically collect data on how often and for how long a subject uses each of the A -
CHESS- PartnerCHESS services. 
A-CHESS/PartnerCHESS data will be collected by [CONTACT_1766]' codename [CONTACT_154801]. Patients will also be asked to set up a pass code on the phone to protect their information in the event someone else finds the phone.  
  
 
 
 
 15 For the potential psychological stress regarding sensitive issues: Participants do not 
have to answer any questions that make them uncomfortable. In addition, study participants can change their minds and choose not to participate at any time.  
Findings of Depression/Self -harm/Harm to Others: If a patient subject is determined to 
be in danger of self -harm, suicide or harm to others when on the phone with a 
participant during a survey or by [CONTACT_42574] a discussion group post on the smartphone, a crisis intervention plan will be implemented. The UW researchers will contact [CONTACT_154781] (e.g., the subject's health care team, and/or police). The study team is mandated to report child abuse and will do so if the issue arises duri ng 
the course of this research.  
If they post a message on A -CHESS, we sen d a message through A -CHESS and will 
try to call the participant. We will ask them if they feel like they are in danger.  And provide them a set of resources in their local community.  
The research site will have at least one contact [CONTACT_154782] a contact [CONTACT_154783]. Mental health referrals will be made when symptoms of major depression, acute anxiety, etc. are indicated in discussion group messages, expert mail, or in the daily or weekly A -CHESS surve y. Subjects will 
be encouraged to call the site contact [CONTACT_154784].  If evidence arises that a participant is contemplating suicide, a 4- step protocol will be initiated that 
includes the following steps: (1) a CHESS staff person will break the code to make identification and emergency intervention possible (e.g., by [CONTACT_154785]); (2) notify the site contact [CONTACT_9702]; (3) initiate crisis intervention to disengage the writer from a suicide method, engage in stabilizing techniques, and 
connect the subject with appropriate support; (4) document and follow -up as 
appropriate.  
If there is evidence of abuse or of a smartphone user being engaged in criminal activity 
(e.g., a discussion group being used to sell an illegal drug), we may need to inform an appropriate authority. Hence our consent form will include the following statement: “I understand that subject anonymity and data confidentiality cannot be maintained if A -
CHESS or Partner -CHESS finds evidence of abuse, suicidality, or criminal activity.”  
Regarding imminent harm to self or others, a specific safety protocol will be in place at the treatment site. If participants experience any crises during the study period, they will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_154786]. If the risk to self or another is imminent, we will collaborate with staff to ensure that clinical staff evaluate the need for emergency services and triage the participant to receive appropriate services. If participants have crises after hours, they will be instructed to call 911 for imminent risk or go to a local emergency room crisis center. All participants will be provided with a listing of crisis hotline numbers and community resources that participants may access 24/7, such as the National Drug Abuse Hotline (800- 662-4357), the National Domestic 
Violence Hotline (1- [PHONE_3472]), or a Crisis Hotline for any crisis (800- 233-4357). For 
patients in the A -CHESS condition and patients and partners in the Partner -CHESS 
condition, these numbers will be set up in their safety plan and stored for use with the “panic button” service, which the participant will be trained to use as part of the 
  
 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_179131] or Stolen Smartphone:  Participants will be informed that if the phone is in the 
hands of another person there is the potential that someone might see the information they stored on the phone (personal contacts, text messages ).  Participa nts are advised 
to make their phone password protected to reduce the risk of someone being able to see their information if the phone is lost or stolen.   
Phone service for the study phone is terminated at the end of the 6 month study period: 
The study coordinator  will explain this prior to informed consent and will inform  the 
participants well in advance of the service ending so they have time to get their own 
service if they wish.  
To help us further protect participant  privacy, we will obtain a Certificate of 
Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.

7.0  STUDY PARAMETERS 
 
40 dyads will be recruited, 6 of whom will participate in development and initial testing of PartnerCHESS and the survey instruments. The remaining 34 dyads will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to either A -CHESS + TAU or PartnerCHESS + TAU. Subjects will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_154787] A -CHESS or PartnerCHESS for [ADDRESS_179135] access to ACHESS and Patients/Partners will have access to Partner 
CHESS for the [ADDRESS_179136] 60 days.
75 Risky drinking will be >4 drinks for men and >[ADDRESS_179137].  These questions are also 
contained in the PhenX tool kit.88 Secondary outcomes  are treatment retention (number 
of weeks from first to last treatment session) using SSTAR data; negative affect 
(measured by [CONTACT_154788]60); and sleep quality.  Exploratory outcomes  are days of other 
drug use and health service use per McCollister and French77; partner risky drinking 
days; abuse; and satisfaction with technology, assessed with Technology Acceptance Model
[ADDRESS_179138] 
comparable measures of them. Including partner mediators is new. Moderators  are 
gender and use of the technologies.  
Demographics and other covariates. Addiction severity will be identified by [CONTACT_9288] -
5 cat egories moderate  or severe based on number of symptoms present.87 We will use 
an adaptation of the Treatment Services Review to track concurrent treatments that patients and/or partners are receiving.  
  
 
 
 
 18 Data analysis plan.  The analysis will: (1) determine if there is a significant difference 
between study arms over the 6- month pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087], and (2) explore the conceptual model 
(Figure 1) —i.e., the relationships between the primary and secondary outcomes and 
patient and partner  mediators, moderators, the 2 study arms, and covariates.  We will 
report descriptive statistics for all demographic and clinical variables in both arms to 
ensure that randomization produced demographically and clinically comparable groups; if not, variables with significant differences will be included as covariates in a sensitivity analysis. Analysis of the impact of PartnerCHESS+TAU vs. A- CHESS+TAU will focus 
on outcomes over time computed from data at pretest, 2, 4, and 6 months, with separate models for  the primary outcomes and each secondary outcome. Linear mixed 
effects models —which account for dependence among successive observations on the 
same patient and incomplete data—will analyze outcomes longitudinally and at each time point. Initial intercepts  will be modeled as random variables to provide variance and 
covariance estimates of intervention effects at each time point and across and between patients. A generalized linear mixed effects model, based on a multiple regression, will be used for the continuous outcome of risky drinking days.
[ADDRESS_179139] time- based effects. 
Sensitivity analyses (with and without covariate adjustment) will determine the robustness of covariate-r elated error control.  
Modeling mediation and moderation. For
  both patients and partners, we will test the 
effect of the interventions on potential mediators  (competence, intrinsic motivation, and 
relatedness) on primary and secondary outcomes, using Barron and Kenny’s90 steps: 
Step 1, the outcomes (e.g., risky drinking days) will be regressed on the interventions (arm 1 vs. arm 2); Step 2, mediators will be regressed on the interventions; Step 3, the intervention variable and mediator variables will be regressed on the outcomes. Mediator effects are statistically significant if: (a) the beta -weight coefficients in Steps 1 
and 2 differ significantly from zero, (b) the Step 3 beta- weight coefficient of the 
mediators is statistically significant, and, (c) the difference between the beta- weight 
coefficients of the intervention variable in Steps [ADDRESS_179140] independent of other significant contributors. We will examine moderated mediat ion because the process may be more 
complex than can be rendered by [CONTACT_154789] (e.g., a mediator may be stronger for women than men or vice versa). We will develop a moderated mediation structure to determine whether the results are best described by [CONTACT_154790] -order interaction terms based on mediator -moderator combinations.  
Power.  We under st
 and that estimating effect size from pi[INVESTIGATOR_154747].  A paper by [CONTACT_154791], Davis, and Kraemer2 points out  that a pi[INVESTIGATOR_154748]. It informs feasibility and identifies modifications needed before a larger hypothesis -testing study. But (they argue) a pi[INVESTIGATOR_154749] e estimates for planning subsequent studies because of the imprecision 
inherent small samples.  Rather, a hypothesis -testing study should be designed to 
detect the smallest difference that is generally agreed to be clinically 
meaningful.  Several studies (e.g. Walters et al.)[ADDRESS_179141] size of d=.35 
  
 
 
 
 19 is considered clinically meaningful. So we will use d=.[ADDRESS_179142] on outcomes . Once the R34 
analyses are complete, we will develop the R01 proposal based on the previous work mentioned above but also considering what we learn about the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment procedures, and new methods  mentioned above.  
Missing data. In previous RCTs, we completed about 85% of survey s through 12 
months and kept missing data on core survey items to about 2%. We expect these rates 
in this study. In addiction treatment, data are not  likely to be missing at random (i.e., the 
probability that data are missing relates to what the data would have been had they been observed). For example, a patient may not want to disclose some information in survey s. Because this may lead to biased parameter estimates, we will identify missing 
data patterns and use pattern- mixture modeling to test the sensitivity of our analysis to 
missing data assumptions

missing data with a range of plausible values based on assumptions for the missing data (e.g., best -case, worst -case; with and without multiple imputation).

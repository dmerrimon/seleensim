COMPOUND: SAR231893 STUDY No: EFC13691  
STUDY NAME: [CONTACT_181309] A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181144]/TRIAL LOCATION Worldwide 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 3 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 
 Primary objective 
x To evaluate the efficacy of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181145], for 
reducing the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) in patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma. 
Secondary objectives  
x To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 
x To evaluate the effect of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181146]-reported 
outcomes (PROs) 
x To evaluate dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181147]-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
Exploratory objectives  
x To evaluate baseline and on-treatment levels of biomarkers in 
association with treatment response and for their potential to predict treatment responses  
x To evaluate patient genetic profiles and their potential to predict 
treatment responses 
x To evaluate the effect of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181148] (at selected study sites within Canada) 
STUDY DESIGN General Design 
Multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
assessing the effect of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181149] (SC) for a 
maximum of 24 weeks in patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma. 
Periods 
The clinical trial will be divided into the following periods: 
x Screening and OCS Optimization period (from 3 to up to 8 weeks 
[up to 10 weeks for patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation 
that requires a change in OCS dose to allow for 2 weeks of 
stabilization prior to randomization]): to determine a patient’s 
eligibility status and to ensure that patients enter the treatment 
period on the lowest dose of OCS that will manage their symptoms 
x Treatment period (24 weeks): includes a 4-week induction phase, a 
16-week OCS reduction phase, and a 4-week maintenance phase  
x Post-treatment period (12 weeks): to monitor a patient’s status after 
completing/withdrawing from study drug treatment for patients not 
rolling over into a long-term  study.

dose a patient can tolerate without experiencing any of the following criteria: 
x Increase in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-[ADDRESS_213703] ACQ-5 score recorded in the e-diary 
x Severe asthma exacerbation 
x Clinically significant event, based on investigator judgment that 
requires treatment by [CONTACT_181236], the investigator can refer to the ACQ-5 score at Screening Visit 1 
to guide the OCS dose adjustments made during the optimization phase of 
the study;  however, the decision to titrate can be based on the investigator’s 
clinical judgement.  Once determined, the optimized dose must remain stable for [ADDRESS_213704] the OCS dose according to a prespecified titration 
schedule based on the OCS optimization phase interruption criteria, and in 
accordance with their clinical judgement.  During the OCS optimization phase, 
the patient’s asthma control will be assessed weekly by [CONTACT_181237] 2.  If the patient’s asthma status remains controlled and none of the above criteria are met, the investigator 
should down-titrate the patient’s OCS dose.  The downward titration will 
continue until a point when at least 1 of the OCS optimization phase 
interruption criteria is met.  If the down-titration is stopped,  the investigator 
should up-titrate the OCS dose by 1 step per Table 1,  unless the patient’s medical condition requires treatment with a higher dose of OCS.   
Those patients who are able to down titrate their OCS dose to 2.[ADDRESS_213705] double the dose of current maintenance dose of OCS.  Following exacerbation treatment, the patient should be placed on the 
OCS dose 1 step higher than the dose they were on when the exacerbation 
occurred.  Note that the optimization period can be extended to 10 weeks to 
allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization.

EFC13691 - dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181143]: 1 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - Page 5 Induction Phase (4 weeks) 
At Visit 3 (Week 0), patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg once every 2 weeks (q2w) of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181150], respectively.  During 
this phase, patients will remain on their optimized dose of OCS along with 
their baseline asthma medications. 
OCS Reduction Phase (16 weeks) 
The OCS dose should be down-titrated during this phase following a 
predetermined schedule that is based upon the optimized OCS dose 
identified during the OCS Optimization Period.  Dose reductions may occur 
every [ADDRESS_213706] 
possible dose reduction can occur at Week 20. No down-titration beyond this 
time point is permitted.  The reduction in OCS dose should occur per the 
schedule unless the patient meets defined criteria indicating that it is not acceptable for the patient to reduce the dose.  A clinical assessment should 
be completed prior to each dose reduction.  Primary reasons for not following 
the scheduled dose reduction include: 
x Mean morning peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_161893] (PEF) <70% of baseline 
stability limit 
x Forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (FEV
1) 20% reduction from 
baseline stability limit 
x Rescue medication (metered dose inhaler) use requiring 4 or more 
puffs/day above the mean baseline value for any 2 consecutive 
days in the prior week, or 12 puffs or more on any 1 day in the prior 
week 
x Change in ACQ-5 score  +0.5 from the prior month OCS dose 
assessment 
x Clinically significant asthma exacerbation 
x Clinically significant event, based on investigator judgment, that 
requires treatment by [CONTACT_181238], depending on the reason for not reducing the 
OCS dose per schedule, whether to maintain or increase his /her current OCS 
dose by 1 step. 
Maintenance Phase (4 weeks) 
Patients will be maintained for the last [ADDRESS_213707] equivalent to double the dose of current 
maintenance dose of OCS.  Following resolution, the patient should be placed 
on the OCS dose 1 step higher than that which he/she was on when the exacerbation occurred for at least 4 weeks and continue with dose reductions

During this follow-up period, patients will continue treatment with their stable 
dose of controller medication (includes all medications used to control asthma symptoms, with the exception of the investigational medicinal product [IMP]) 
that can be modified based on their level of asthma control, as determined by 
[CONTACT_737]. 
During the post-treatment period, patients will continue to collect e-diary 
information that can be used to determine asthma control. 
Eligible patients completing the treatment period may have the opportunity to 
roll over into a long-term study with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  Patients subsequently 
enrolled in this long-term study will not participate in the Post-treatment period 
of this trial. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and 
encouraged to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits.  In addition, 
patients who discontinue early from treatment or patients who choose not to roll over into a long-term study may be asked to return to the clinic to have 
additional ADA samples collected for analysis based on the overall 
assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination  
The sample size estimation is based on the comparison between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181155]: percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared with the baseline dose and proportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or 
greater in their OCS dose compared with baseline at Week 24, while 
maintaining asthma control.  For the primary endpoint, assuming a common 
standard deviation of 50%, with [ADDRESS_213717] 94% power to detect a treatment difference of 27% at the 2-tailed 
significance level of Į=0.05.  For the key secondary endpoint, with the same 
sample size of [ADDRESS_213718] 81% power to detect a difference in the proportion of patients achieving 50% or 
greater in their OCS dose of 33% in the placebo group, compared to 54% in 
the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181156] 2-tailed significance level of Į=0.05. 
Patients will be randomized using a 1:1 randomization ratio for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 
300mg q2w and placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_181240] 0 ( 10 mg/day, >10 mg/day) and country.  
Recruitment of patients whose eosinophil level is below 150 cells/ μL will stop 
when approximately 46 (25% of the total sample size) of such patients are 
randomized.  Recruitment will continue with patients whose eosinophil level is 
greater or equal to 150 cells/ μL until reaching the total sample size of 180.  In 
addition, the number of patients receiving 5 mg OCS at Visit 3 will be limited 
to approximately 54 patients (approximately 30% of the study population). 
Analysis population 
The analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population defined as all randomized patients.  The efficacy analyses 
will be conducted according to the treatment to which they are randomized. 
The analysis population for the safety endpoints will be the safety population 
defined as all patients exposed to study medication, regardless of the amount 
of treatment administered.  The safety analyses will be conducted according 
to the treatment patients actually received. 
Primary analysis 
The outcome of the percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared 
with the baseline dose, while maintaining asthma control, will be calculated 
as: (optimized OCS dose – final OCS dose at Week 24)/optimized OCS dose 
× 100%.  The percentage reduction will be analyzed using an analysis of

reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 as the response variable, and treatment 
group, baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL and 150 cells/μL), 
optimized OCS dose at baseline, region as covariates.  Patients who 
permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged 
to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits and the Investigator will 
continue to prescribe OCS at the dose specified for OCS titration.  The off-
treatment OCS dose at Week 24 will be used in the primary analysis. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints  
The absolute reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model in the same fashion as for the primary endpoint (percent 
reduction of OCS dose at Week 24). 
The proportion of patients achieving OCS reduction will be analyzed using a 
logistic regression model including treatment, baseline eosinophil level 
subgroups, optimized OCS dose at baseline, and region as covariates. 
The annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation events will be analyzed 
using a negative binomial regression model.  The model will include the total 
number of events occurring during the 24-week Randomized Treatment 
period as the response variable, with the treatment group, baseline eosinophil 
level subgroups, region, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, and number of severe exacerbation events prior to the study as covariates.  Log transformed 
treatment duration will be the offset variable.  For patients who permanently 
discontinue the treatment, the events which occurred up to Week [ADDRESS_213719]

change from baseline FEV 1 values up to Week 24 as response variables, and 
factors (fixed effects) for treatment, age, sex, height, baseline eosinophil level 
subgroups, region, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, visit, treatment 
by-visit interaction, baseline FEV [ADDRESS_213720] model.  
The change from baseline for continuous endpoints will be analyzed using a 
MMRM in the same fashion as for the change in FEV 1.  Data up to Week 24 
will be included as response variables.  Age, sex, and height will be included 
as covariates in the models for spi[INVESTIGATOR_181157].

(only applicable for patients who plan to roll over into  a long term study).  Note: Anti-ds DNA antibody will be tested if ANA  is positive ( 1:160 titer).  At Visits 3 (randomization), 8, and 11, the 
blood sample should be taken with the patient in fasting state which means no intake of any food or drink except for water for at least 8 hours.  If the visit can only be done at a different time of 
the day and the patient is not fasting, then he/she should be advised to eat a light meal and the site should document that ser um chemistry was not obtained under fasting conditions. 
uUrine dipstick analysis, including specific gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, blood protein, nitrate, leukocyte esterase, urobilin ogen, and bilirubin. If any parameter on the dipstick is abnormal, a 
urine sample should be sent to the central laboratory for testing.  If positive for proteins, microscopic analysis will be perf ormed by [CONTACT_12115]. 
vPharmacokinetic samples will be collected prior to dosing.   
wSystemic drug concentration and ADA samples are to be collected prior to dosing. In the event of any SAE or any adverse event o f special interest (AESI) of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic 
reaction related to IMP and requiring treatment, or severe injection site reaction lasting longer than 24 hours, samples will b e collected near the onset and resolution of the event for any

long-term control.  However, it is estimated that 5% to 10% of asthma pa tients have symptomatic 
disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_181165] w ith combinations of anti-inflammatory and 
bronchodilator drugs.  These patients account for up to 50% of the total health cost through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], use of emergency services, and unscheduled physician visits ( 1). 
Although asthma is well controlled with inhaled therapy in most patients, approximately 10% of 
the patients have severe asthma that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.  
Severe asthma is a heterogene ous syndrome with multiple distin ct phenotypes based on several 
clinical, functional, and in flammatory parameters ( 2,3).  From a clinical perspective, severe 
asthma has been divided into 3 subgroups ( 1,4):  
xFrequent asthma exacerbations with relatively stable periods in between 
xAsthma with fixed airway obstruction 
xCorticosteroid-dependent asthma 
Corticosteroids are highly effectiv e in patients with severe asth ma; however, the regular use of 
systemic steroids can result in serious deleteri ous side effects affecting numerous body systems 
(eg, formation of cataracts, muscle weakening, central nervous system disorders, and osteoporosis) ( 5,6).  There is a clear need for safe cor ticosteroid sparing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_181166]. Current available options do not offer a po sitive benefit-risk ratio.  The consequences of 
unresponsiveness to therapy or lack of compliance with therapy is loss of asthma control and ultimately, asthma exacerbation. The poor response of some patients with asthma may reflect the number of cellular and molecular mechanisms operative in asthma. There is increasing interest in distinct phenotypes because targeted therapy is more likely to be successful in patients with 
similar underlying pathobiologic features ( 4). 
In a recently published trial involving 135 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, treated with 
oral corticosteroids (OCS) for more than 6 months in addition to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with a second controller, received mepolizumab (an anti-interleukin [IL]-5 monoclonal antibody) or placebo for [ADDRESS_213742] a dose reduction in their OCS daily dose.  The median percentage reduction was 50% for the actively treated patients ( 7). 
Recent therapeutic approaches in asthma have b een focused on trying to control the T-helper 
cell-2 (Th-2) response.  Up-regulation of IL-4 and IL-13 activity has been implicated as an 45

IL-[ADDRESS_213744] in reducing asthma exacerbations , improving lung function and asthma control in

4.2 RATIONALE 
4.2.1 Rational for study design 
This Phase 3 study will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], in comparison with 
placebo, in reducing the use of OCS while maintaining asthma control in patients with severe 
refractory asthma.  The study will also investigate the effects of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181168], including asthma exacerbation rate , quality of life, and lung function (eg, forced 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second [FEV 1]).  The study will enroll patie nts with severe asthma and 
well-documented, regular prescribed  treatment of maintenance syst emic corticosteroids  in the 
6 months prior to screening.  The clinical trial will be divided into 3 periods: 
xScreening and OCS optimization period (from 3 to up to 8 weeks [up to 10 weeks for those 
patients who experience an asthma exacerbati on that requires a change in OCS dose to 
allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization]). 
xTreatment period (24 weeks): includes a 4-week induction phase, a 16-week OCS 
reduction phase, and a 4-week maintenance phase. 
xPost-treatment period (12 weeks): to monitor the patients’ status following completion of 
study drug treatment.  This period only applies for those patients not rolling over into a 
long-term  study. 
The presence of a placebo arm is appropriate for the objectives of this study, since it will provide 
the most robust assessment of the efficacy and safety of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181169]. 
The OCS adjustments (increase or  decrease) during the Optimization phase and the length of the 
Optimization phase are deemed suitable because the patients have been managed on a stable dose of OCS for a significant period of time prior to the start of the study (as per by [CONTACT_181244]).  A similar optimization approach was successfully employed in 3 published OCS reduction studies ( 7,9,10). 
The proposed study design provides the opportunity to better understand the efficacy of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181170], prevention of severe asthma exacerbations, and symptom control while reducing the dose of OCS over a period of 24 weeks.

The dose regimen of subcutaneous (SC) dupi[INVESTIGATOR_125358] 300 mg every 
2 weeks (q2w).  All patients randomized to receive treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181171] [ADDRESS_213745] 300 cells/ PL or a sputum eosinophil level of at least 3%, partially controlled or uncontrolled 
by [INVESTIGATOR_49377]-to-high doses of ICS plus long-acting beta agonist (LABA; fluticasone/salmeterol, 
budesonide/formoterol, or mometasone/formoterol) were randomized to the study.  The study showed unprecedented efficacy in a population of mostly severe asthmatics with poor asthma control and decreased lung function inadequately controlled with mostly high doses of ICS in combination with a LABA. 
In addition, in the Phase 2b study DRI12544, 776 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 
1 of 4 dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181172].  The doses tested were: 200 mg every 4 weeks (q4w), 
[ADDRESS_213746] patient completed 12 weeks of treatment.  The assessment, change from baseline in FEV
1 at Week 12, was the final 
analysis of the primary endpoint.  The analysis of annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation included all events that occurred during the treatment period, adjusted by [CONTACT_181245].  At the time of this analysis, the average observed treatment duration was approximately 21.4 out of 24 weeks (approximately 89% of study information), with 70% of patient having completed 
24 weeks of treatment, and 30% of patients had completed the 16-week off-treatment follow-up.   
Compared with placebo, treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181173]-dependent improvement in 
FEV
1 and reduction in the annualized severe asthma exacerbation rate.  In general, the q2w dosing 
regimens demonstrated greater efficacy than the q4w dosing regimen.  Both the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w dose regimens demonstrated statistically significant improvements in FEV
1 and a 
significant reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations versus placebo in the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population, patients with a baseline high eosinophil count ( 300 
cells/μL), and patients with a lower baseline blood eosinophil (<300 cells/ μL).  In contrast to the 
q2w regimen, the q4w dosing regimens demonstrated a consistently lower improvement in FEV
1

6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
Screening is from signed informed consent to randomization and the study observation period 
starts at randomization and lasts until the end of the study.   
The total duration of the study (per patient) is expected to be up to 44 weeks (or up to 46 weeks in 
patients who experience an asthma exacerbation th at requires a change in OCS dose to allow for 
2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization) and consists of: 
xUp to 10 weeks for the Screening period/OCS Optimization phase 
x24 weeks for the Treatment period 
x12 weeks for the Post-treatme nt period (for patients not rolling over into a long-term 
study) 
Patients who discontinue early from treatment or patients who choose not to roll over into a 
long-term study may be asked to return to the c linic to have additional ADA samples collected for 
analysis based on the overall assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for all remaining study visits. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The last patient last visit will occur when the la st patient either comple tes the end-of-treatment 
(EOT) visit (Visit 11) and rolls over into long-term study, or at the end of the 12-week safety follow-up period if the patient co mpletes treatment and elects not to  roll over into long-term study 
or discontinues treatment early, or withdraws during the Post-treatment period for any reason, whichever occurs last.

[IP_ADDRESS] Screening Period/Oral Corticosteroid Optimization Phase (Visits 1 and 2) 
Patients who meet eligibility criteria at the Scr eening visit will enter the OCS Optimization Phase.  
Prednisone or predniso lone will be the only OCS used.  At  the Screening visit (V1), patients 
currently using other forms of maintenance OCS w ill have their corticostero ids switched to either 
of these corticosteroids at a dose clinically equi valent to their current stable OCS maintenance 
dose.  The definition of stable OCS maintenance dose in EFC13691 is no change of OCS dose within [ADDRESS_213766] dose a 
patient can tolerate without experien cing any of the following criteria: 
xIncrease in ACQ-5 of 0.[ADDRESS_213767] ACQ-5 score recorded in the e-diary 
xSevere asthma exacerbation 
xClinically significant event, based on investigator judgment that requires treatment by 
[CONTACT_181236], the investigator can refer to the ACQ-5 score at Screening Visit 1 to guide the OCS 
dose adjustments made during the optimization phase of the study; however, the decision to titrate 
can be based on the investigator’s clinical ju dgement.  Once determined, the optimized dose must 
remain stable for [ADDRESS_213768] the OCS dose according to a prespecified titration schedule ( Table 1 ) 
based on the OCS optimization phase in terruption criteria, and in acco rdance with their clinical 
judgement.  The decision rule of the titration sc hedule will be based on changes in the patient’s 
asthma control, assessed by [CONTACT_86950].  In the absence of a severe asthma exacerbation or 
a clinically significant event, the change in OCS dose should be guided directly by [CONTACT_181255]-5 
score. 
A severe asthma exacerbation event during the study is defined as a deterioration of asthma 
requiring:

with a systemic corticosteroid treatment (at least double the dose currently used) 
No change in OCS dose will be made at Visit 1.  One week after the Screening visit (Visit 1), 
patients will return to the clinic for Visit 2.  At Visit 2, and weekly throughout the Optimization 
phase, patient stability will be assessed by [CONTACT_181256].   
If at Visit 2, the patient’s asthma status remains controlled (ie, none of the above criteria are met), 
the Investigator should down titrate the patient’s OCS dose.  The downward titration will continue 
until a point when at least 1 of the OCS optimizati on phase interruption crite ria are met.  If the 
down-titration is stopped, the investigator should up-titrate the OCS dose by 1 step per Table 1 , 
unless the patient’s medical condition requires treatment with a higher dose of OCS. 
Deterioration is defined as an increase in the ACQ-5 score of 0.[ADDRESS_213769] ACQ-5 score 
recorded in the e-diary, the occurrence of a severe asthma exacerbation, or a clinically significant event, based on investigator judgment that requires treatment by [CONTACT_181257].  In these cases, the patient will return to the prior OCS dose at which none of the OCS optimization phase interruption criteria were met.   
If at Visit 2, or weekly thereafter, the patient's asthma status deteriorates as outlined above their 
OCS dose should be increased by 1 step ( Table 1 ).  In this manner, the Screening/OCS 
Optimization phase can range from 3 to 8 weeks until an optimized dose of OCS is achieved 
(Note: If an asthma exacerbation occurs that requires a change in OCS dose, this period can be extended up to 10 weeks to allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization.)  
In cases where the stable OCS dose for [ADDRESS_213770] conservative decrease that approximates the Table 1 protocol guidance.  As an example, 6 mg could be reduced to 5 mg and then per protocol to 2.5 mg thereafter, or 8 mg to 7.5 mg and then 5 mg, depending upon the individual patient and the investigator’s judgment.  In th e event of any uncertainty, the Investigator will 
discuss the therapy directly with the Sponsor prior to the first OCS dose reduction. 
Those patients who are able to down titrate their OCS dose to 2.5 mg during the OCS 
Optimization phase without meeting any of the above criteria, will be considered screen failures 
and will not be randomized.

  None of these reports can be delivered to unauthorized persons. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an adverse event (AE), the code should only be broken in circumstances when knowledge of the IMP is required for treating the patient.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by [CONTACT_179616] (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) and/or by [CONTACT_125459].  If the blind is broken, the Investigator 
should document the date, time of day, and reason for code breaking.   
Patient withdrawal will only occur when the code break  call is made at the s ite level, not the study 
level.  This means that if the emergency unblinding transaction is performed by [CONTACT_737] (ie, at the site level), then the patient will be withdrawn from treatme nt.  However, if the 
emergency unblinding transaction is performed by [CONTACT_125460] (GSO; ie, at the study level, as the GSO is not site  based), then the patient will not  be withdrawn from treatment.  
At the facilities where the systemic drug co ncentration measurements, ADA, and selected 
biomarkers are determined, the sa mples will be analyzed prior to data base lock leading to 
unblinding of responsible bioanalysts.  Bioanalysts are excluded from the clinical trial team.

9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT 
9.1.1 Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 
compared with the baseline dose,  while maintaining asthma cont rol.  The percent reduction in 
OCS dose will be calculated as: (optimized OCS do se – final OCS dose at Week 24)/optimized 
OCS dose × 100.  A patient will be considered as having maintained asthma control between 
Week 20 and Week 24 if he/she does not have a clinically significant event, based on investigator 
judgment that requires treatment by [CONTACT_181239].  For those patients who experience an exacerbation, the final OCS dose will be considered to be 1 step higher than the dose they were receiving at the time of the exacerbation.  Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked an d encouraged to return to the clinic for all 
remaining study visits and the Investigator will continue to prescribe OCS at the dose specified 
for OCS titration.  The off-treatment OCS dose at Week 24 will be used in the primary analysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Oral corticosteroid dose adjustments 
The dose adjustment of OCS through the OCS Re duction phase of the stud y will be based on the 
following: 
xAsthma symptom data collected through the eDiary (ACQ-5 score) 
xClinically significant asthma exacerbation(s) 
xMean morning PEF <70% of baseline stability limit as assessed in the week prior to the 
clinical visit 
xFEV 1 20% reduction from baseline stability limit 
xRescue medication use requiring 4 or more puffs/day above the mean baseline value for 
any 2 consecutive days in the prior week, or [ADDRESS_213781] the score in the eDiary 
(starting with Visit 1 onwards).  The Investigat or will review the eDiary data on a weekly basis 
during the OCS Optimization phase and monthly during the Randomized Treatment period.

9.2.1 Secondary efficacy endpoints related to adjustments in oral corticosteroid dosing 
The key secondary endpoint is: 
xProportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS dose compared 
with baseline at Week 24 while maintaining asthma control.  The relative reduction for 
each patient will be calculated as (optimized OCS dose – final OCS dose at 
Week 24)/optimized OCS dose × 100. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
xAbsolute reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared with the baseline dose while 
maintaining asthma control 
xProportion of patients achieving a reduction of OCS dose to <5 mg/day at Week 24 while 
maintaining asthma control 
xProportion of patients no longer requiring OCS at Week 24 while maintaining asthma 
control 
xProportion of patients achieving their maximum possible reduction of OCS dose per 
protocol at Week 24 while maintaining asthma control.

[IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Control Questionnaire 
The ACQ was designed to measure both the adequa cy of asthma control and change in asthma 
control which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment.  During the OCS Optimization period, the ACQ-5 will be completed weekly in the patient’s eDiary.  During the treatment period, the ACQ-[ADDRESS_213789] a scheduled clinic visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 question version 
The ACQ-5 is a 5-item questionnaire, which has been developed as a measure of patients’ asthma control that can be quickly and easil y completed in clinical practice ( 14).  The questions are 
designed to be self-completed by [CONTACT_102].  The 5 questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening on waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath, and wheezing).  The response options for all these questions consist of a 0 (no 
impairment/limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation) scale ( Appendix D ).  The ACQ-5 score 
is a mean of the values recorded for the individual questions. 
Throughout the study patients should complete the ACQ-5 on a weekly basis using their eDiary.  
The results from the ACQ-5 will be used as a part of the assessmen t to determine patient 
eligibility for OCS dose adjustment.  The patient should complete the questionnaire within the eDiary.  The patient should be instructed to complete the questions as accurately as possible.  The patient should be reassured that there are no right or wrong answers.  If the patient requests help or clarification with any of the questions, he/she will be asked to reread the instructions and give 
the answer that best reflects how he/she felt over the previous week.  The Investigator should not provide the patient with any answer or attempt to interpret any portion of a question. 
If the ACQ-5 is completed through the eDiary while the patient is at a scheduled in-clinic visit, it 
is recommended that the ACQ-5 be  administered at the same time during the visit.  To avoid 
biasing responses, the patients should not be told the results of diagnostic tests prior to completing the questionnaire and should be completed before any procedures are performed on the patient to avoid influencing the patient’s response.  Adequate time should be allowed to complete all items on the ACQ-5.

[IP_ADDRESS] Health care resource utilization 
A questionnaire of health care resource utilization (reliever medication, specialist visit, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency or urgent medical care facility visit, outcome, sick leaves, school days’ loss, etc) will be administered at each visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Airway hyperresponsiveness (optional; only for patients enrolled in select sites in 
Canada)
Airway hyperresponsiveness will be assessed through a bronchial provocation test using 
methacholine (to be done only if the patient’s FEV 1 is 70% of predicted).  A 20% decrease in the 
FEV [ADDRESS_213792] to cause this decrease is

9.2.3 Safety and tolerability endpoints  
The same safety assessments will be applied across both arms.  A dverse events, including serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and AEs of  special interest (AESI), will be collected at every visit.  The 
Investigator will ask the patient how he/she has fe lt since the last study visit.  To assure the 
continuing safety of patients in this study, an  independent DMC will be responsible for reviewing 
the safety data on a periodic basis throughout the course of the study as outlined in Section  6.4.1 . 
Safety observations 
xThe Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients.  
Notably, he/she should follow up the outcome of SAEs /AESI until clinical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results  have returned to normal or until progression has been 
stabilized or death.  In all cases, this may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034].

Adverse events for each patient will be monito red and documented from th e time the patient gives 
informed consent at Visit 1 until the End-of-Stu dy visit (Visit 14) or until the rollover to a 
long-term study, except for: 
xSerious AEs 
xAdverse events that are ongoing at database lock 
Adverse events, AESI, and SAEs will be reported as described in Section  10.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital signs 
Vital signs, including blood pressure (mmHg), he art rate (beats per minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 
(breaths per minute), body temperature (degrees Celsius) and body weight (kg) will be measured 
at every visit.  Height (cm) will be measur ed at the Screening visit (Visit 1) only.  
Vital signs will be measured in the sitting position using the same arm at each visit, and will be 
measured prior to receiving investigational product at the clinic visits.  
Refer to Section  1.1 for the schedule of vital signs performed throughout this study.

Please refer to the Operational Manual for additional information. The ECGs will be manually read at  a central reading vendor.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical laboratory tests 
The clinical laboratory tests will be conducted by [CONTACT_181271] (College of American Pathologists 
or equivalent) central laboratory with national and regional clinical licenses as required for diagnostic testing and must provide evidence of participation in prof iciency testing, as 
appropriate.  After reviewing the laboratory report and evaluating any results that are outside the 
normal range, the Investigator must sign and date the laboratory report.   
Abnormal laboratory values that are considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_181272] t to rule out laboratory 
error.  Persistent abnormal laboratory values should be repeated until they return to normal or until an etiology of the persistent abnormality is determined. 
Refer to Section  1.1 for the description of the clinical laboratory evaluations and the schedule of 
laboratory evaluations performed throughout this study. 
The clinical laboratory parameters that will be measured are: 
xHematology: To include hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, total white blood cell 
(WBC) count with 5-part differential count, and total red blood cell count. 
xSerum chemistry: To include creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c), uric acid, total chol esterol, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin (in case of 
values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, alkaline phosphatase, lactate 
dehydrogenase, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), bicarbonate, and creatine 
phosphokinase.  At Visits 3 (randomization), 8, and 11, the blood sample should be taken with the patient in fasting state which means no intake of any food or drink except for water for at least 8 hours.  If the visit can only be done at a different time of the day and the patient is not fasting, then he/she should be advised to eat a light meal and the site should document that the serum chemistry was not obtained under fasting conditions. 
xUrine dipstick analysis: To include specific gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, blood, protein, 
nitrate, leukocyte esterase, urobilinogen and bilirubin (by [CONTACT_5230]).  If any parameter on 
the dipstick is abnormal, a urine sample should be sent to the central laboratory for testing. If positive for proteins, microscopic analys is is performed by [CONTACT_12115]. 
xSerum immunoglobulins: quantitative immunoassays for total IgG, IgG subclasses 1-4, 
IgM, and IgA (after the first administration of  IMP, results are blinded to the sites and 
sponsor study team).

Patients should complete PROs before undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_68333]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire 
The AQLQ was designed as a self-administered PRO to measure the functional impairments that 
are most troublesome to patients as a result of their asthma (see Appendix G ).  The instrument is 
comprised of 32 items, each rated on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 to 7).  The AQLQ has 4 domains.  The domains and the number of items in each domain are as follows: 
xSymptoms (12 items) 
xActivity limitation (11 items) 
xEmotional function (5 items) 
xEnvironmental Stimuli (4 items) 
A global score is calculated ranging from 1 to 7 and a score by [CONTACT_121982].  Higher scores indicate 
better quality of life. 
The instrument has been used in many clinical tr ials, and it has been shown to be reliable, valid 
(patient interviews), and sensitive to change.  The MCID for the AQLQ is 0.5 ( 15).

[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181205] a general scale used to detect states of anxiety and depression and has been 
validated in patients with asthma (see Appendix I ).  The instrument is comprised of 14 items: 
7 items each related to anxiety and depression.  Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3; 
with a score for either anxiety or depression ranging between 0 and 21. 
The minimal important difference for the HADS-A (anx iety) has been reported to be in the range 
of 0.41 (anxious and depressed patients in active treatment controlled studies) to 1.32 (COPD patients), in the range of 0.50 (anxious and depressed patients in active treatment controlled studies) to 1.40 (COPD patients) for HADS-D (depression) and approximately 1.5 (COPD patients) for the HADS total score ( 17,18). 
Alternatively, a significant improvement in treatment versus placebo group was defined as the 
percentage of patients who moved from a defined category of moderate to severe depression or anxiety (8) to not having the disease (<8) ( 19).  Using this methodology Stelara (Ustekinumab) 
was able to make the claim in summary of produ ct characteristics that “HADS was significantly 
improved in the treatment group compared with placebo” ( 20). 
[IP_ADDRESS] EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized health-related quality of life questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_181273] a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal ( 21).  The EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by [CONTACT_1962]. 
The EQ-5D essentially consists of 2 pages – the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual 
analogue scale (VAS; see Appendix J) .  The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue

and 0 (worst imaginable health state) at the bottom.  The MCID for the EQ-5D in asthma patients has been reported to be in the range of 0.001 to 0.074 ( 22,23). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Asthma symptom score 
Patients will record overall sympto m scores in an eDiary twice a day prior to measuring their 
PEF.  Symptoms experienced during the night will be recorded upon arising (AM symptom score).  The patient’s overall asthma symptoms experienced during the waking hours will be recorded in the evening (PM symptom score).  Baseline symptom scores will be the mean AM

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The clinical study consists of 3 periods:  
1. Screening and OCS Optimization Period (from 3 to up to 8 weeks for those patients who 
experience an asthma exacerbation that require s a change in OCS dose this period can be 
extended to 10 weeks to allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization; Visits 1 and 2) 
2. Treatment Period (24 weeks): includes the randomization visit (Visit 3) and a 4-week 
induction phase (Visits 4 and 5), a 16-week OCS reduction phase (Visits 6-10), and a 4-week maintenance phase (Visit 11)  
3. Post-treatment Period (12 weeks; Visits 12-14) 
The study visits occur on the planned dates (rela tive to the first injection), as scheduled. After 
randomization, the visit schedule should be adhered to within the ± 3 day visit window. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for all remaining study vi sits and participate in follow-up assessments 
according to the visit schedule.  Under exceptional circumstances when a patient cannot come to the site for the scheduled visit/s, a phone contact [CONTACT_125465]. During the phone contact [CONTACT_181279], concomitant medications and exacerbation events should be collected. 
Patients should be reminded that sexually active female patients of reproductive potential are 
required to practice effective contraception during the entire study duration, while taking dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181217] [ADDRESS_213803] IMP dose. 
Prior to all screening assessments, after discussi on of participation in  the study, the written 
consent form (including voluntary participation in pharmacogenetic testing/future use of blood samples) must be signed and dated. 
Although the screening assessments for this study are grouped under the heading of 2 visits in this 
protocol, it is possible for them to be performed over more than the 2 scheduled site visits if necessary, as long as the screening window prior to randomization (Day 1) is respected.  If certain dynamic laboratory tests do not meet the eligibility  criteria, these laboratory assessments may be 
repeated, at the discretion of the Investigator, if it is judged to be likely to return to acceptable range for study inclusion within the screening visit window prior to Day 1.  These patients do not need to sign a new ICF and be allocated a ne w patient number within this same screening 
window. 
Patients that fail the initial screening for exclus ion criteria, eg, concomita nt medications, may be

Patients who fail the Screening Visit because of eDiary/spi[INVESTIGATOR_181218], or 
patient-related/site perso nnel-related unintentional errors may be rescreened 1 time after approval 
is granted by [CONTACT_1034]’s clinical study director. In every case of rescreen allowance due to technical equipment malfunction and/or unintentional human error(s), the Study Investigator must document receipt of Sponsor approval and, when applicable, document the site’s corrective action plan to prevent future occurrences. 
All clinical assessments and blood samples should be performed/collected prior to the 
administration of the IMP, unless otherwise specified.  
For patients at select sites in Canada who have agreed to participate in the optional assessment, a 
sputum sample will be collected at the time of an asthma exacerbation during an unscheduled visit. 
10.1.1 Screening and Oral Corticosteroid Optimization Period 
Patients who meet eligibility criteria at the Screening visit (Visit 1) will enter the OCS Optimization phase.  The Screening/ OCS Optimization Period will be from 3 to up to 8 weeks (if 
an asthma exacerbation occurs that requires a change in OCS dose this period can be extended to 10 weeks to allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization) in duration, dependent upon 
the length of time the patient requires to optimize their OCS dose. 
Prednisone or prednisolo ne will be used as the OCS.  At th e Screening visit, patients currently 
using other forms of maintenance OCS must have their corticosteroids switched to the 
corresponding equivalent daily dose of prednisone/prednisolone.  
Follow up visits/phone calls may be added during this period depending on the patient’s response 
to OCS dose changes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Visit 1 (Week -8 to -3) 
Following a discussion of participation in the clinical trial, informed consent must be obtained and documented.  These steps precede any study procedures.  In patients who experience an asthma exacerbation during the OCS Optimization phase, this visit may occur at Week -9 or -10. 
The following procedures will then be performed:

DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possible.  In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort.  Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the eCRF.  In any case, the 
patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal products 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by [CONTACT_181280].  Re-initiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical and/or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have  considered according to his/her best medical 
judgment that the AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with 
IMP.   
In addition, the following conditions(s) will be cause for temporary treatment discontinuation: 
xInfections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment. 
xAny laboratory abnormality that meets temporary treatment discontinuation criteria as per 
Appendix F . 
10.3.[ADDRESS_213867](s) 
Permanent treatment discontinua tion is any treatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the pati ent not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_213868] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision.  All efforts should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the 
e-CRF. 
Patients must be withdrawn from tr eatment (ie, from any further in vestigational treatment) for the 
following reasons: 
xAt their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospectiv e patient to the patient ’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research). 
xIf, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
patient’s well-being. 
xAt the specific request of the Sponsor.

All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation should be recorded by [CONTACT_179641].   
Patients who discontinue early from treatment may be asked to return to  the clinic to have 
additional ADA samples collected based on the overall assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for remaining study visits and participate in follow-up assessments according 
to the visit schedule.

consent for follow-up will jeopardize the public health value of the study. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible adverse 
events to their decision to withdraw consent, and any adverse event information elicited should be documented.  
Patients may withdraw consent verbally or in writing and, if verbal, then the site needs to 
document in source records that patient withdrew consent verbally.  All study withdrawals should be recorded by [CONTACT_181282] e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, at least the date of the 
withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end-of-study 
visit including a systemic drug concentration sample, if appropriate, and three Post treatment 
Period Visits. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Investigator should make the best effort to re-contact 
[CONTACT_102] (eg, contact[CONTACT_12531]’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_179642] s must be documented in the patie nt’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
A patient should only be designated as lost to follow-up if the site is unable to establish contact

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
xResults in death, or 
xIs life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening”  in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
 hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
xRequires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
xResults in persistent or sign ificant disability/incapacity, or 
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
xIs a medically important event 
xMedical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such  as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179576] (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important ev ents is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which condition has to be considered as a medically important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:

- Anaphylaxis (refer to Appendix K  for the definition of anaphylaxis) 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12995], absence, etc). 
- Development of drug dependence or drug abuse - ALT >3 × ULN + total bilirubin >2 × ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase >10 × ULN 
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality - Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling)

product as a regimen or as distinct entities.  The GSO must communicate this decision to the study team for inclusion in the protocol and AE CRF. 
xThe Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laborat ory results have returned to nor mal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the sa fety of the patients.  This may imply that

opportunistic infection.  As a precautionary measure, the Investigator is required to carefully monitor for any signs or symptoms of infec tion such as, but not limited to, increased body 
temperature, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, or serious febrile 
systemic illness. 
Since dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181222]-4R Į, preventing IL-4 and IL-13 activation of their respective 
receptors, it inhibits the T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokines production. Infections with a diversity of helminthic parasites elicit eosinophilia via stimulation of Th2-like lymphocyte responses. The Th2 response is characterized by [CONTACT_181290]-4, IL-[ADDRESS_213892]'s immune response and by [CONTACT_181291], including its distribution, migration, and development within the infected host. Therefore, patients treated with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181223]. 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  defines infections that should be reported as AESIs (ie, within 24 hours). 
A complete diagnostic work-up should be performed (ie, cultures, histopathological or cytological 
evaluation, antigen detection, and serum antibody titers).  Patients should be referred to an infectious disease specialist if deemed necessary for diagnostic work up and appropriate treatment. 
Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment should have study drug 
discontinued until the in fection is resolved. 
For any opportunistic infection, such as TB or other infections whose nature or course may 
suggest an immunocompromised status (Appendix L), patients must be permanently discontinued from study medication. 
In order to minimize this risk, any patient with an active parasitic infection should be excluded 
from the study. Similarly, patients with suspected parasitic infection, or those at high risk of parasitic infection are also ex cluded, unless clinical and (if ne cessary) laboratory assessments

history of parasitic exposure through recent travel to/ or residence in endemic areas, especially 
when conditions are conducive to infection (eg, extended stay, rural or slum areas, lack of running 
water, consumption of uncooked, undercooked, or otherwise potentially contaminated food, close contact [CONTACT_181292], etc). Subsequent medical assessments (eg, stool exam, blood tests, etc) must be performed in order to rule out parasitic infection/infestation.   Patients with confirmed parasitic infections during the study should be reported as AESI with immediate notification.  
10.6.4 Elevated liver function tests 
No preclinical and clinica l data has suggested any hepatic toxicity of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]; however, as a 
general consideration of clinical development, the administration of immunosuppressant or immunomodulating agents may represent an additional risk factor for hepatotoxicity. 
In order to closely follow potential liver function abnormalities, assessment of total protein, 
albumin, total bilirubin, ALT, aspartate aminotra nsferase, and alkaline ph osphatase are measured 
as part of the clinical laboratory testing.  Clin ical laboratory testing at Visit 1 and Visit 10 (only 
applicable for patients who pla nned to roll over into a long-term study) adds hepatitis screen 
(HBsAg, HBsAb, IgM and IgG/total-HBcAb, and HCVAb).  Patients who are IgG/total-HBcAb 
positive and HBsAg negative at Visit [ADDRESS_213894] undergo HBV DNA testing prior to 
randomization to determine eligibility (only applicable for patie nts who plan to roll over into a 
long-term study).  Furthermore, it is recommended that patients who are receiving potentially immunosuppressive therapy and are IgG HBcAb positive and HBV DNA negative undergo surveillance HBV DNA studies every [ADDRESS_213895] should be consulted on a case-by-case basis. 
Hepatitis virus tests and liver f unction tests (LFTs) will be performed at Visit 1, prior to 
randomization, to exclude those patients with high risk of hepatitis infection or severe liver injury from this study  (Section  7.2 and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
In order to closely follow potential liver abnormalities, assessment of total protein, albumin, total 
bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and nonconjugated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase are measured as part of the clinical laboratory testing ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
Guidance for the investigation of elevated LFTs is provided in  Appendix F.

11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
The outcome of the percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared with the baseline 
dose, while maintaining asthma control, w ill be calculated as (optimized OCS dose at  
baseline – final OCS dose at Week 24)/ optimized OCS dose at baseline × 100%.   
The percentage reduction will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.  
The model will include the percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 as the response variable, and the treatment groups, optimized OCS dose at baseline, regions (pooled countries), and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL, 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  A review of 
the residuals will be done to determine whether the normality assumption is met.  If the normality assumption is not met, a rank ANCOVA model will be used to corroborate the result. 
The treatment difference will be tested at the 2-sided significance level of Į=0.05.  Descriptive 
statistics for the primary efficacy endpoint will be provided, including the number of patients, means, standard errors, and least squares (LS) mea ns by [CONTACT_150227], as well as the 
difference in LS means and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).  
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for all remaining study visits  and the Investigator will continue to prescribe 
OCS at the dose specified for OCS titration (as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  The off-treatment

biomarker levels.  The details  will be provided in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Analysis of the key secondary efficacy endpoint 
The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS dose at Week 24 
compared with baseline will be analyzed using a logistic regression model.  The model will use 
the binary status of whether or not a patient achieved the 50% OCS dose reduction criterion as the response variable, and treatment groups, optimized OCS dose at baseline, regions (pooled countries), and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL or 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  
For patients who permanently discontinue the treatment, their final dose used for the primary efficacy endpoint will be used to determine whether or not they achieve the OCS dose reduction 
criterion. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Analysis of the absolute reduction of OCS dose  
The absolute reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model in 
the same fashion as for the primary endpoint, percent reduction of OCS dose at Week 24. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Analysis of proportion of patients achieving a certain reduction of OCS dose 
The proportion of patients achieving a certain reduction of OCS dose will be analyzed in the same manner as the key secondary endpoint.  The model will use the binary status of whether or not a patient achieves the prespecified OCS dose reduction criterion as the response variable, and the treatment groups, optimized OCS dose at baseline, regions (pooled countries), and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL or 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  For patients who 
permanently discontinue the treatment, their final dose used for the primary efficacy endpoint will 
be used to determine whether or not they achieve the OCS dose reduction criterion.

model will include the total number of the events  occurring during the 24-week Treatment Period 
as the response variable, and the treatment groups, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, regions (pooled countries), number of the events within 1 year prior to the study, and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL, 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  Log-transformed treatment duration 
will be the offset variable.  For patients who pe rmanently discontinue the treatment, the events 
which occurred up to Week [ADDRESS_213902] contac t date will be used to 
calculate the offset variable. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Analysis of time to event variables 
Time to event parameters (eg, first severe asthma exacerbation, first exacerbation requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181225]) will be analyzed usin g a Cox regression model with the time to event 
as the response variable, and the treatment groups, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, regions (pooled countries), number of the events within 1 year prior to the study, and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL, 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method 
will be used to derive the proportion of patients with an event at Weeks [ADDRESS_213903] date will be analyzed.

The change/percentage change from baseline for other continuous variables (eg, FEV 1, PEF, FVC, 
FEF 25-75% , ACQ, asthma symptom scores) will be analyzed using a mixed effect model with 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach.  For a continuous variable, the corresponding MMRM 
model will include the change/percent change from baseline as response variables, and factors (fixed effects) for the treatment groups, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, regions (pooled 
countries), baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ PL, 150 cells/ PL) visits, 
treatment-by-visit interaction, the corresponding baseline value of the endpoint, and baseline-by-visit interaction.  Additionally, age, gender, and height will be included as covariates 
in the models for spi[INVESTIGATOR_181226].  An unstructured correlation 
matrix will be used to model the within-patie nt errors.  Parameters will be estimated using 
restricted maximum likelihood method with the Newton-Raphson algorithm.  Statistical inferences on treatment comparisons for an endpoint will be derived from the corresponding mixed-effect model.

PROJECT SUMMARY  
 
 
1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT  
 
1.[ADDRESS_493614] trimester surgical abortion, and found that there was no difference in pain level 
(as measured by [CONTACT_393340]) at time of cervical dilation between women randomized to 
the standard paracervical block group versus the lidocaine gel only group. Given that 
pain remains a limiting barrier for other gynecologic office procedures as well, we 
decided to apply this met hod of analgesia to intrauterine device (IUD) insertions . 
 
For these procedures no standardized clinical guidelines for pain management exist. 
Reducing pain associated with IUD insertion may benefit patients and providers. When 
patients are comfortable during their procedure, it is likely the provider can more quickly 
and with fewer complications perform the insertion. It could also be argued these 
patients would report higher satisfaction with their procedure and provider [Kass -Wolf & 
Fisher , 2014]. To our knowledge, there is limited clinical consensus on pain 
management guidelines, demonstrating value in researching potential pain 
management solutions.   
 
We propose to explore the effect of a locally applied vaginal lidocaine gel in place of  the 
standard of care pain management (i.e. paracervical block or no intervention 
respectively) prior to IUD insertions . 
 
SALUD (IUD insertion): We hypothesize that lidocaine gel is superior to placebo at 
decreasing procedural pain at a variety of time poi nts throughout the procedure. This is 
a superiority, blinded, randomized controlled trial.  
 
If self -administered vaginal gel is acceptable and effective, it would increase options for 
pain control during abortion and other gynecologic procedures (IUD inse rtion). 
 
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_493615] of care (i.e. no pre -procedu ral analgesia).  
 
If a patient -administered vaginal gel is acceptable and effective, it would increase 
options for pain control during these gynecologic procedures.  
 
Hypothesis : Patients who receive 20 mL of 2% lidocaine gel self-administered  20-[ADDRESS_493616] pain control superior to that of a placebo gel . 
 
Primary Outcomes  
• SALUD (IUD Insertion): Pain perceived by [CONTACT_27326] (0 -100 mm) at 
the time of speculum removal  
 
Secondary Outcomes  
• Pain perceived at additional time points during/after the procedure:  
o Anticipated pain: measured upon clinic intake   
o Baseline pain:  upon arrival to procedure room  
o After speculum placement  
o After tenaculum placement  
 
Note: The research coordinator will stand at the head of the bed beside the patient with 
an iPad that has an enlarged VAS on it. They will ask the patient to tap somewhere 
along the VAS at these various time points to indicate their respective pain score.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_493617] shown promising results.  Although many providers recommend 
that patients take nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prior to the proced ure, 
a 2009 Cochrane review concluded that NSAIDs are not effective at reducing pain 
during IUD insertion. The same review also concluded  that the use of mis oprostol to 
soften and open the cervix does not effectively reduce peri -insertional pain during 
insertion in nulliparous women, and may cause side effects. In a randomized trial, a 1% 
lidocaine paracervical block did not significantly d ecrease perc eived pain with IUD 
insertion [Mody, 2012 ]. Randomized cont rolled trials by [CONTACT_393341]. and McNicholas et 
al. examined the effect of 2% cervical lidocaine gel applied [ADDRESS_493618] of our knowledge, there is no published data that 1) rigorously examines the 
effects of a prolonged time interval between local anesthetic administration and IUD 
insertion, or 2) explores whether adequate pain relief is possible through self -
administered,  non-invasive means alone.  
 
In a soon to be published study conducted at Stanford  (my primary fellowship project) , 
self-administration of 20 ml of 2% lido caine gel [ADDRESS_493619] of 2% lidocaine gel s elf-administered [ADDRESS_493620] of care pain management (i .e, no intervention).  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_493621] 
commonly practiced method for pain management in these procedures (no 
intervention).  In this study , participants and health care professionals will be blinded 
from the intervention/study group. Standard lubricating gel has the same clear gel 
appearance as lidocaine gel and will be used to ensure blinding. Due to logistical 
barriers with n eeding to prepare the gel immediately prior to insertion, the research 
coordinator responsible for enrolling and randomizing participants will not be blind to the 
intervention.  
 
Participants will be recruited from Stanford Gynecology Clinic . Informed cons ent will be 
obtained prior to enrollment by a trained research coordinator after which, patients will 
be randomized to either group by [CONTACT_17188]. At the completion of the 
procedure, compensation will be given in the form of a $[ADDRESS_493622]  or a $15 
donation to a fund that assists low -income women obtain family planning services.  
 
1.3.2   Criteria for the selection of subjects  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
Women ages 18 and older presenting for  elective IUD insertion (any type of IUD, copper 
or hormonal); at an out -patient setting at Stanford; English speaking, and ability to give 
informed consent.  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
• Pre-operative use of misoprostol  
• Allergy to study medications (lidocaine)  
• Known uterine anomaly  
• Prior cervical surgery  
• IV conscious sedation  
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_493623] Recruitment and Allocation  
 
Potential participants will be identified for recruitment if scheduled for IUD insertion (regardless 
of type) at the Stanford University Gynecology Clinic . They will b e approached by [CONTACT_393342]. If enrolled, they will be 
randomized by [CONTACT_17188]. The research coordinator will prepare a 20ml pre -filled 
syringe with either 2% lidocaine gel or placebo , so that the physician/researcher is blinded to 
the group allocated. Participants will receive the treatment previously allocated on a rolling 
bases. The patient and provider will be blinded as to the treatment group.  
 
All patients will then receive instr uction on how to properly self -insert the study medication using 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_393333] a similar RCT at this site (SALSA).  
 
1.3.4   Description of the drugs and devices to be studied  
 
Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) is a common local anesthetic that works by [CONTACT_393343]. Local anesthetics of the amide type are thought to act within the 
sodium channels of the nerve membrane. Accor ding to the packaging insert, anesthesia 
is achieved within 5 minutes, depending on the area of application, and duration of 
anesthesia is approximately 20 -30 minutes.  It is used prior to many genitourinary 
procedures involving mucus membranes including t he urethra, anus, and vulva. While 
no recommended dose is known for vaginal use prior to surgical abortion, 
recommended doses are known for the following procedures: 20 ml for 
proctoscopy/anoscopy; 10 ml for female urethral anesthesia as in cystoscopy. A s ingle 
maximum dosage for 2% Xylocaine jelly is not established [Blanco 1982], however 
Lexicomp drug information for topi[INVESTIGATOR_393334] a maximum dose of 600 mg in 
any 12 -hour period.  
 
The serum toxicity of intracervical lidocaine is thought to b e around 5 ug/ml [Blanco 
1982] and a study looking at serum lidocaine levels 10 minutes after paracervical 
injection of 20 ml of 1% lidocaine (200 mg total) found mean blood levels of 0.9 to 1.61 
ug/ml [McKenzie 1978].   
 
Similarly, a study investigating v aginal anesthesia with 4ml of 10% lidocaine spray 
(400mg total) 5 minutes prior to high dose intracavitary brachytherapy found a 
significant decrease in procedural pain [Chen 1998]. This study also looked at serum 
lidocaine levels at various time points fo llowing administration and found that the 400mg 
dose never reached toxic levels in participants. These data are further supported by 
[CONTACT_105]-toxic levels seen after nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal application in the studies 
sited above.  
 
Based on this informa tion, participants in the lidocaine gel group will self -administer 20 
ml of 2% lidocaine HCl vaginally (400 mg total) [ADDRESS_493624]:  
• XYLOCAINE® JELLY 2 % (lidocaine hydrochloride) [COMPANY_008]

Control Groups:  
 
SALUD (IUD Insertion Arm):  
No Intervention Group: As an alternative to lidocaine gel, participants will receive no 
intervention for pain management for IUD insertion (standard of care), but will receive 
placebo gel (standard lubricating gel).

outcome) and assessment of overall acceptability (likelihood to recommend procedure 
or choose this form of pain control again). Any potential procedural complications will be 
managed using typi[INVESTIGATOR_393335].  
 
1.3.7   Criteria for discontinuation  
 
Subjects will be able to withdraw from the study at any point during the procedure 
should they so choose.  
 
1.3.8   Laboratory and other investigations  
 
Not-applicable.  
 
1.3.9   Data management  
 
Data management will be done using RedCap, an electronic data capture program, and 
performed by [CONTACT_393344] (fellow).  
 
1.3.10   Data analysis  
SAS Version 9.3 and SPSS Version 23.0 will be used for data analysis.  
Statistical Methods:  
 
• Demographic  characteristics will be examined among the randomized groups 
using Fisher’s exact test  
• Median  VAS pain scores will be analyzed with Student’s t-tests and non -
parametric tests, respectively  
• Linear regression may be completed in multivariate analysis to identify predictors 
of pain  in an exploratory analysis  
 
1.3.11   Number of subjects and statistical power  
 
SALUD (IUD Insertion): The following powe r calculation accounts for continuous 
outcomes in a superiority trial  
 
n = f( α/2, β) × 2 × σ2 / (μ1 − μ2)[ADDRESS_493626] size = 15% difference in VAS [Jensen 2003, Todd 1996, 
Rowbothom 2001]  
o Mean outcome in control group: 36.7mm [Allen 2013]  
o Standard deviation of VAS = 21.7mm [Allen 2013]  
o Assuming α = 0.025, β = 0.10, 90% power  
 
SUMMARY: [ADDRESS_493627] a 90% chance of detecting, as significant 
at the 2.5% level, a decrease in the primary outcome measure from 36.7 in the control 
group to 21.7 in the experimental group. Accounting for drop -outs and protocol 
deviat ions by [CONTACT_1583] 10% to the number of participants, the total enrollment will be 220.  
 
1.3.12 Study limitations  
 
The potential limitations of this study include inability to blind the research coordinator 
given the need for preparation of the gel immediately  prior to the patient’s self -insertion, 
and the fact that this is a single site out -patient clinic at a university setting, that may not 
reach as widely as is desirable for the purposes of generalizability.

IUD procedures per month . Estimating 30% enrollment, the anticipated length of the study is [ADDRESS_493629] management  
 
The study coordinator and investigator will be responsible for data entry in RedCap and export 
to SAS for statistical analysis and any required data cleaning. All data cleaning is tracked when 
done in this manner decreasing data entry, transposition and cleaning errors. The study 
coordinator will be responsible for maintaining locked files containing research study consents 
and any other paper document ation created. Remaining data collection will occur via the secure 
system, RedCap, using an iPad in the clinic with the patient and provider/study coordinator.

Executive Summary  
Moderate to severe pain is common  in up to 75% of patients undergoing sternotomy for cardiac 
surgery and 4% of them develop chronic post -sternotomy pain1. Pain after cardiac surgery is 
multifactorial and caused by [CONTACT_459965], sternotomy, sternal retraction, internal mammary artery 
dissect ion, mediastinal and pleural drains, saphenous vein harvest, position of the patient and 
stretching of brachial plexus.  Pain after cardiac surgery is often undertreated because of fear of 
inducing cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_459907]. Untreated and 
undertreated pain has severe adverse consequences in cardiac surgical patients. Inadequate pain 
control can lead to increased sympathetic discharge, increased myocardial demand, myocardial 
ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, decreased ventil ator effort and clearance of secretions, prolonged 
mechanical ventilation, increased postoperative pulmonary complications, delayed patient 
mobilization, poor patient satisfaction, increased length of intensive care unit and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_459908] t of health care1. Commonly used treatment modalities include acetaminophen, oral 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_459909], respi[INVESTIGATOR_114148] 
(hypoxemia and carbon -dioxide retention), prolonged ileus, constipation, urinary retention and 
postoperative nausea and vomiting. Neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia (spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], epi[INVESTIGATOR_459910]) are avoided in cardiac surgery due to th e risk of inducing neuraxial 
hematoma with anticoagulation and neurological deficits. Neuraxial catheters also need 
management by [CONTACT_459966]. Current practice of local anesthesia 
infiltration into the wound is limited by [CONTACT_459967] (lidocaine and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) and was associated with increased incidence of wound 
infections2. Recent studies explored the use of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel; Pacira 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippan y, NJ) and duration of analgesia with this slow release 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459911] [ADDRESS_587294] implantations and abdominal surgical procedures3. There are no studies to date that 
investigated the use of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459912]. Our aim is to study 
the analgesic efficacy and safety of wound infiltration with liposomal  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459913] (CPB) and compare it 
with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459914].  
Background  
Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  (LB)  has recently  been the ta rget for many clinical trials  with the 
expectation that long lasting analgesic efficacy would improve patient satisfaction and patient 
outcomes. Several randomized studies have shown positive effect on postoperative pain relief with 
the use of LB (Table  1).  The following  eviden ce-based research  indicates the utility  of LB in 
specific surgical population s.  
Abdominal surgery  
Kalogera et al4 in a retrospective cohort study examined the utility of wound infiltration with LB 
after gynecologic surgery through laparoscopy and laparotomy. Median oral morphine 
equivalents, IV patient controlled analgesia (IVPCA) opi[INVESTIGATOR_459915], IV rescue anal gesia 
with opi[INVESTIGATOR_459916] (ERAS) population. Efficacy was better in laparoscopy population than in 
laparotomy patients.  
Hutchins et al5 in a randomized ob server blinded study compared ultrasound guided transversus 
abdominal plane (TAP) blocks with LB versus  non-liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459917]. There was a significant decrease in maximal pain 
scores and IVPCA fentanyl injection up to [ADDRESS_587295] 72 hours after surgery. A trend was noted in the LB 
group towards a shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340508] . Beck et al7 compared patients receiving multimodal 
analgesia that included LB infiltration and patients  using conventional pain management using IV 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_459918]. Patients receiving multimodal 
analgesia had lower pain scores, lower IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_459919].  
In spi[INVESTIGATOR_459920],  a few others failed to show significant benefit. Knudson et al8 compared LB 
and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459921] a non -sponsored, 
prospective randomized and double blinded clinical trial (n=57). IVPCA hydromorphine 
requirements were comparable for both groups and they suggested larger clin ical trials to define 
the effectiveness of LB. In another cohort study using  propensity - matched analysis, TAP block 
with LB was compared with IVPCA and epi[INVESTIGATOR_459922] (106 patients in each group). TAP blo ck was non -inferior to epi[INVESTIGATOR_459923]9. They recommended a larger clinical trial 
comparing these techniques. Knight et al10 in a prospective, randomized, patient blinded clinical 
trail evaluated wound inf iltration with LB and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459924]. No difference was found between  the groups in pain scores, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], adverse events or length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
Failure to demonstrate analgesic benefit in the above mentioned studies could be related to sample 
size, study methods (prospective versus retrospective cohort), variation in wound infiltration 
method and LB volumes, type of surgery (laparotomy versus laparoscopy), other analges ics used 
and duration of follow up.  
Orthopedic surgery  
Shoulder surgery  
Routman et al11 studied the effect of adding LB infiltration to multimodal analgesia (consisted of 
narcotics, gabapentin, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and singl e injection 
interscalene block) on postoperative analgesia and duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. The LB cohort had 
fewer  narcotic requirements, better visu al analog scores and shorter hospit alization after shoulder 
arthro plasty. However, when local infiltration w ith LB was compared with interscalene block in a 
prospective randomized clinical tri al, no significant benefits could be demonstrated  with the use 
of LB infiltration12. 
Knee arthroplasty  
A systematic review conducted by [CONTACT_459968]13, of studies comp aring standard periarticular 
injections and LB injection s have shown that LB had comparable length of stay, ambulation 
distance, PONV, pain scores and narcotic consumpti on after total knee arthroplasty (TKR) . 
Considering the cost, they questioned the use o f LB in pain management after TKR.  Ma et al14 
published another systematic review of [ADDRESS_587296] pain management (n=686) to LB infiltration (n=586) in total hip 
arthroplasty ( THR ) patients. Pain scores were similar. Patients who received LB had lower narcotic 
consumption, better achievem ent of physical therapy milesto nes, decreased length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_459925]. Barrington  et al reported several  large series of 
arthroplasty patients treated with LB and demonstrated superior pain relief with better outcomes 
using this drug16,[ADDRESS_587297] IV 
narcotic ana lgesia in patients undergoing single level discectomy procedures . Patients in LB group 
received shorter duration of IV analgesics  (average difference 10.3 hours)  but no differences in 
pain scores, total narcotic consumption or length of stay were detected when compared to standard 
pain manage ment group. Kim et al studied LB  infiltration versus standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459926]. They demonstrated significantly 
reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], reduced pain scores and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_459927]20. In patients undergoing posterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_459928], Grieff et al21 
compared standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459929], narcotic consumption and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. However, there was a trend 
towards less narcotic consumption in LB group.   
Plastic surger y 
Several studies evaluated the use of LB and demonstrated its benefits in plastic surgical procedures 
such as  breast  reconstruction, augmentation mammo plasty, abdominal wall reconstruction, 
mastectomy, bunionectomy and abdominoplasty22-26. Vyas et al27 performed a systematic review 
of [ADDRESS_587298] pain relief techniques (nerve 
blocks, epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187], patient controlled analgesia and IV narcotics). They reported safety, 
tolerability and equivalent or b etter efficacy with LB in plastic surgery.  
Cardiothoracic surgery  
Very few clinical trials examined the role of LB in postoperative analgesia after cardiac surgery. 
Thoracotomy is associated with significant pain and inadequate pain relief may lead to poor 
outcomes. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_459930], respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], pruritus and need for acute  pain service consult ( for 
infusion  pumps  management  and follow -up). Intercostal block with LB was tested and compared 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_459931] a retrospective study by [CONTACT_459969]28. There was a significant 
improvement in pain scores on days 1 and 3 bu t no significant difference on day 2. No significant 
difference could be shown in narcotic consumption but there was significant decrease in 
pulmonary complications in LB group. Total length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_459932].  
Robotic cardiac surgery with multiple thoracic ports and incisions can be associated with 
significant postoperative pain. Balkhy et al29 compared bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (n=30) and LB (n=30) 
infiltration through incision and port sites in patients undergoing robotic cardiac surgery. Patients 
in LB group had less pain intensity , reduced narcotic consumption  and reduced incidence of PONV 
compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124195]. The results did not achieve statistical significance because of 
small sample size but there was a trend towards better a nalgesic efficacy with LB.  
There are no studies to  date on the use of LB infiltration and its analgesic efficacy in cardiac 
surgery done through sternotomy. Although other surgical approaches are useful in selected group 
of patients  and surgeries , majorit y of cardiac surgery is still done through sternotomy  approach. 
We hypothesize that a randomized clinical trial to evaluate  the benefits of LB infiltration in cardiac 
surgery will be beneficial  for this surgical population.

and 20cc per inch of incision ).  
Anesthetic Management  
After the patient signs informed consent, patients are enrolled into the study. Mida zolam [ADDRESS_587299]. After intubatio n, oxygen and a volatile anesthetic (isoflurane or 
sevoflurane) will be used for maintenance of anesthesia and muscle paralysis achieved with non -
depolarizing muscle relaxants titrated to neuromuscular monitor. Intermittent fentanyl will be 
administered to  all patients as analgesic and will be titrated by [CONTACT_459974], isoflurane will be administered through CPB circuit and neuromuscular paralysis is 
maintained. Bispectral index is monitored to keep the values between [ADDRESS_587300] CPB period, ondansetron 4 
mg IV will be administered  to all patients in both groups. IV hydromorphine 1 mg will be 
administered for all patients during sternal wiring.  After the drapes come down, patient’s 
neuromuscular blockers will be reversed and extubation performed in the operating room. Patients 
who could not be extubated will be transferred on propofol to intensive care unit and will be 
extubated shortly by [CONTACT_459975].  
Outcomes  
Postoperative pain scores and total narcotic consumption in the first 72 hours postoperative period 
will be co -primary outcomes. Pain intensity will be evaluated by [CONTACT_310496] , NRS  (0- no 
pain [ADDRESS_587301] pain)  at rest, deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_459939].  NRS scores will be 
evaluated every [ADDRESS_587302] -operative analgesia will be provided by [CONTACT_459976], non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory dru gs, oral oxycodone (5 -10mg), IV narcotics administered by [CONTACT_459977] (PCA) with narcotics based on the patient ’s ability to take 
oral drugs and the intensity of pain. Three commonly used IV narcotics include: hydromorphone, 
morphine  and fentanyl. All narcotics administered in the first 72 hours will be converted to total 
IV morphine equivalent for comparison between the two groups .Patient controlled postoperative 
analgesia with hydromorphine (0.2 mg every 6 minutes ) without a basal infusion will be primarily 
used during ICU stay. Intravenous h ydromorphine (0.2-0.4 mg ) will be administered by [CONTACT_459978]. Oral oxycodone and IV acetaminophen 
can be given as rescue analges ics. All IV and oral narcotics administered in the first 72 hours will 
be converted to IV morphine equivalent for the purpose of analysis. IVPCA is discontinued if pain 
scores were persistently less than 4 and duration of IVPCA requirement will be noted.   
Secondary  outcome measures include the time to extubation , time to mobilization  and out of bed 
to chair , time to oral intake, noninvasive ventilation requirement and re -intubations, use of 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], postoperative nausea and vomiting , major organ dysfunction (cardiac, renal, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_459940])  from Society of Thoracic Surgeon’s database , length of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289686], readmissions and 30 day and in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380].  
Other pre -specific outcome measures include: Delirium, patient satisfaction, chronic pain 
assessment, and serum cortisol levels.   
An Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) will be administered at baseline, [ADDRESS_587303]-operatively.  They participant will also be assessed for patient satisfaction 
regarding pain management at the time of discharge. Chronic pain assessment using 0 –10 Numeric 
Pain Rating Scale Questionnaire (for both groups):  Two follow -up questionnaires  will be 
administered to all study subjects at 6 and 12 months after the surgery. Subjects will be asked: On 
a scale of [ADDRESS_587304] pain imaginable, how would 
you rate your pain? Current, worst and best pain levels will be questioned and an average pain 
score will be taken during rest and activity . 
In addition to clinical parameters, the suppression of stress response will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_459979]. Serum cortisol hormone levels will  be 
measured at baseline (right before surgery) , 8, [ADDRESS_587305] 
48 hours after sternotomy was (IV  morphine equivalent doses) 27 mg (SD 18  mg). Based on our 
previous institutional study, the estimated average narcotic consumption in the first 48 hours after 
sternotomy was (IV morphine equivalent doses) 27 mg (SD 18 mg). We anticipate mean narcotic 
consumption to be reduced to 14 mg with the use of  wound infiltration with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. 
With Alpha at 0.05 and 80% power, we estimate 30 patients will be required in each group (total 
n=60 patients). Since cardiac surgical patients may have high drop out rate (15%), we plan to 
recruit 70 patient s to demonstrate the analgesic superiority (total narcotic consumption in 48 hours) 
of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425163]. We anticipate 30% reduction in narcotic consumption with 
the use of wound infiltration with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. With Alpha at 0. 05 and 80% power, we 
estimate 51  patients will be req uired in each group (total n=102  patients). Since cardiac surgical 
patients may have high drop out ra te (15%), we plan to recruit 11 87 patients to demonstrate the 
analgesic superiority (total narcotic cons umption in 48 hours) of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_459941].  Interim statistical analysis will be done at the end of 50 patients before proceeding 
with a complete study.  
Data will be collected on d emographic variables  (age, gender, weight) and procedural variables 
(type of surgery, duration of surgery, CPB duration) and postoperative outcome parameters.  
Continuous variables such as narcotic consumption, length of ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and time 
to extubation will be a nalyzed using Student t test or Mann Whitney U test wherever 
appropriate. Incidence of complications and other binary variables between the groups will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_459980]. P value less than 0.05 will be considered 
significa nt. Confidence intervals and relative risks will be defined w herever appropriate. 
Intention -to–treat analysis will be used for the study population.

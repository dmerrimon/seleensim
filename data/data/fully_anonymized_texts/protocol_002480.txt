Introduction:  SPARTA science has developed  a post -operative rehab 
tool allowing the surgeon and the entire healthcare staff to optimize care according to the patient’s specific needs. The Sparta Platform includes force plate hardware coupled with Sparta Scan  
software that enables quick assessment of an individual’s movement and ba
lance  within minutes  
 The Sparta Scan takes a comprehensive look into an individual’s movement  qualities by [CONTACT_120260]. The magnitude as 
well as efficiency of  force production is analyzed to determine  the 
progress of the  patients on predicted trajectories of recovery, and more 
easily identify and triage those few patients who might have to stay longer in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11964].  
As part of an integrated clinical care pathway, post -operative scoring of 
likelihood  of discharge is an attractive prospect, because it allows 
caregivers to focus on patients who require the most assistance with 
obtaining safe and appropriate postoperative care .  
  
Purpose  To obtain an objective score 
which is patient -centered, data -
drive n, and value -based solution 
for post -operative  rehabilitation .  
 
Eligibilty criteria   Joint replacement  surgery , age 
should be more  than or equal to 
18 years.  
 

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   October 8, 2021  Study type  Prospective observational study  
Sample size  60  
Endpoints  Primary endpoint: Length of stay 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Higher the s core, 
shorter is the stay.  
Secondary endpoint: Reliability on 
force plate to co-relate with 
clinical data on data points such 
as discharge location, gait aid use, 
Knee society score(KSS) and range of motion (ROM). Time intervals 
for recording Gait aid use, KSS 
and ROM are as - 
1. Gait aid use  at the time of 
discharge,  2 weeks follow 
up, 6 weeks follow up, 3 weeks follow up, 1 year 
follow up and 2 year follow up  
2.  Outcome score ( KSS)  at 3 
weeks follow up, 1 year  
follow up and 2 year follow up 
3. Range of motion at 2 weeks follow up, 6 weeks follow 
up, 3 months follow up, 1 
year  follow up and 2 year 
follow up  
PROM used  KOOS JR, PROMIS & KSS  
Budget  TBD 
Personnel  IRB submission & data collection

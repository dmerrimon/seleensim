Version 12.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 11Definition of Key Study Terms
Terms Definition of terms
Baseline Observed values/findings which are regarded as the starting point for 
comparison. 
Enroll To register or enter into a clinical trial. NOTE: Once a subject has been 
enrolled, the clinical trial protocol applies to the subject. 
Intervention The drug, therapy or process under investigation in a clinical study that is 
believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study. (e.g., health -
related quality of life, efficacy, safety, pharmacoeconomics). 
Investigational 
periodPeriod of time where major interests of protocol objectives are observed, and 
where the test drug or comparative drug (sometimes without randomization) is 
usually given to a subject, and continues until the last assessment after 
completing administration of the test dru g or comparative drug.
Post investigational

ASP2215Phase of Development:  
Phase 1/2
Title of Study:
A Phase 1/2 Open- Label, Dose Escalation Study Investigating the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of ASP2215 in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Acute 
Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
Planned Study Period: 
From 4Q2013 to 3Q201 7
Study Objective(s): 
The primary objectives of this study are to:
Assess the safety and tolerability, including determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 
of oral ASP2215 in subjects with relapsed or treatment -refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ASP2215.
The secondary objectives of this study are to:
Investigate the anti -leukemic activity of various doses of ASP2215 in subjects with AML. 
Evaluate the effect of strong or moderate cytochrome P450 -isozyme3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors on 
the PK of ASP2215.
Evaluate the potential induction of CYP3A4 by [CONTACT_106346]2215 by [CONTACT_780643].
Evaluate the effect of ASP2215 on MATE1 substrates by [CONTACT_780644] .
Planned Total Number of Study Centers and Location(s):  
Approximately 35 centers
[LOCATION_002], Italy, [LOCATION_009] and [LOCATION_013]
Study Population:  
Patients with AML who relapsed after or are refractory to induction or salvage treatment.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled/Randomized:  
Up to 40 subjects in dose escalation cohort and up to 250 subjects in dose expansion cohort.
Study Design Overview:  
This study is an open -label, dose escalation, first -in-human study in subjects with relapsed or 
refractory AML, with concomitant expansion cohort for multiple doses. One cycle is   defined as 
28days and the subject will receive oral ASP2215 daily. The study treatment will continue until one 
of the discontinuation criteria is met or until rollover into the 2215 -CL-0109 study. 
The starting dose level of ASP2215 is 20 mg daily and the decision to dose escalate to the next dose 
level will be made based on the assessment of safety variables including occurrence of grade 2 
adverse events (AE) or DLTs.
Study Design Overview continued :  
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1073084] two cohorts of subjects (Figure 1 and Figure 2):  
1.Cohort 1: Dose escalation cohort
2.Cohort 2: Dose expansion cohort
Cohort 1 
Cohort 1 will comprise the initial dose escalation cohort with up to 10 dose levels ( Table 1). This 
cohort will be run at approximately 5 centers which will only participate in the dose expansion cohort 
(Cohort 2) if the enrollment in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1) is on a pause (i.e., dose level 
being tested at the time is fully enrolled and the one higher dose level has not yet been opened) . 
Subjects will be treated daily in 28 day cycles (with the exception of Cycle 1 where subjects will 
receive 29 doses). The DLT observation period is [ADDRESS_1073085] cycle and after receiving a single dose of the study drug on Day -2. 
This study will follow an accelerated titration design. Dose levels are set at around 50% increments. 
One subject will be treated at the starting dose level of [ADDRESS_1073086] 
will be enrolled at double the dose level, i.e. dose level 3 (40 mg see Table 1). This dose escalation 
approach will continue wherein only odd numbered dose levels (1, 3, 5) are tested until the first 
instance of a DLT or second instance (observed in tw o subjects at any of these dose levels) of a 
grade 2 AE judged by [CONTACT_178759] (e.g., possibly, probably, or definitely) to study 
drug (except for hematologic toxicities) occur.  
When a DLT or second instance (observed in two subjects) of grade [ADDRESS_1073087], the dose escalation schedule will stop the double- dose level method and follow 
the next consecutive dose level in Table 1 utilizing the modified 3+3 design. Modified 3+3 design 
testing each conse cutive dose level may also be followed if recommended by [CONTACT_780645].  After dose level 5 (80 mg), each 
subsequent dose level (6- 10) will be tested using the 3+3 design. In this phase, 3 subjects w ill be 
treated at each dose level. If no DLTs are observed, the subsequent subjects will be treated at the next 
dose level. If one DLT is observed in a dose level, 3 more subjects will be enrolled at that dose level. 
If the 3 additional subjects do not exp erience a DLT, the next dose level will be initiated. If 2 or more 
DLTs occur in a dose level the next lower dose level will be declared the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD).
Subject replacement in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1)
A subject that receives less than 80% of the intended dose during Cycle 1 (e.g., misses 6 daily doses 
or leaves the study for reasons other than a DLT), will not be evaluable for DLT and will be replaced 
by [CONTACT_780646]. In addition, if after enrollment any s ubject is found not to fulfill 
any inclusion/exclusion criteria that would adversely affect safety or efficacy evaluation of that 
subject, they may be replaced after discussion between the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_780615].
Cohort 2
Cohort 2 is th e dose expansion cohort. This cohort will be conducted at approximately 35 additional 
centers that will not participate in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1). However, those centers 
participating in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1) may participate in the dose expansion cohort 
(Cohort 2) after the completion of the dose escalation phase (Cohort 1). Cohort 1 centers may also 
enroll patients in Cohort 2 if the enrollment in Cohort 1 is on a pause (i.e., dose level being tested at 
the time is fully enro lled and the one higher dose level has not yet been opened). Subjects will be 
treated daily in [ADDRESS_1073088] dose taken on C1 D1. 
In the dose expansion phase (Cohort 2), a dose level may be expanded as follows:

Version 12.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 11If one subject in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1) at any dose level achieves complete 
remission (CR), complete remission with low platelets (CRp) or complete remission with 
incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) then this dose level will continue to enroll a minimum of 
3subjects. After the decision is made to escalate to the next dose level (0/3 or 1/6 DLTs observed), 
the dose level will be expanded to enroll up to 17 ad ditional subjects. All subsequent dose levels 
will also be expanded following a dose escalation decision for the dose level in the dose escalation 
cohort (Cohort 1). When more than one dose levels are expanded in the dose expansion cohort 
(Cohort 2), the newly enrolled patients will be randomized to all open expanded dose levels ).
In the absence of a CR, if the median decrease of FMS -like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) 
phosphorylation in plasma inhibitory assay (PIA) is equal or greater than 90% in a dose level with 
at least 3 subjects, then this dose level and the subsequent levels will be expanded following a dose 
escalation decision for the dose level (0/3 or 1/6 DLTs observed) in the dose escalation cohort 
(Cohort 1).
Subjects will be assigned in the dose escala tion cohort (Cohort 1) or randomized in the dose 
expansion cohort (Cohort 2) to one of the open dose escalation levels as defined in the statistical 
methodology section [Section 7]. At least 10 subjects with FLT3 mutations (internal tandem 
duplication [ITD] or activating point mutations) will be enrolled to each expanded dose level 
(including the subjects in the dose escalation cohort). Dose levels a t and above 120 mg will be further 
expanded (when found to be tolerable in Cohort 1) based on the efficacy results observed in 
escalation and expansion cohorts as described in the Statistical section.  At least 42 evaluable subjects 
with FLT3 mutations wil l be enrolled in dose levels selected for further expansion ( Figure 2).  The 
safety in the dose expansion cohort (Cohort 2) will be monitored using Bay esian logistic regression 
modeling, as described in Section 7, based on the DLT rate observed in subjects from both the dose 
escalation and expansi on cohorts.
In the dose expansion cohort (Cohort 2), and for the first dose level only, the effect of CYP3A4 
inhibition for strong inhibitor voriconazole (Schedule 2B) will be evaluated in all subjects in the dose 
level. In the dose expansion cohort (Coho rt 2), and at the highest dose level of ASP2215 (MTD or one 
level below MTD), the effect of ASP2215 on midazolam pharmacokinetics (Schedule 2D) will be 
evaluated. After completion of the CYP3A4 inhibition expansion (Schedule 2B) and until MTD is 
determined, Cohort 2 subjects will participate without the drug -drug interaction (DDI) component 
(Schedule 2C). DDI studies (Schedules 2B, 2D and 2E) will be conducted in the [LOCATION_002] only.  
European sites whose patients are randomized to the DDI arms of the st udy will follow Schedule 2C 
and will not administer their patients these medications. In addition, US sites approved by [CONTACT_780647] 2C even if patient s are randomized to Schedule 2B or 2D.
Patients who have a contraindication to voriconazole or midazolam can participate in the trial without 
the DDI component (Schedule 2C) after discussion with the medical monitor. 
If the first dose level closes prior t o [ADDRESS_1073090] of CYP3A4 inhibition for strong inhibitor voriconazole.
To further evaluate DDI, a sub-study with a MATE1 substrate will be conducted [ Table 2E].  This 
cohort will have approximately [ADDRESS_1073091] of ASP2215 on the MATE1 transporter.  The pharmacokinetics of 500 mg 
cephalexin will be investigated prior to initiation of ASP2215 treatment at Cycle 1 Day -1 and at 
Day 15 of Cycle 1.  This DDI sub -study (S chedule 2E) will be conducted in the [LOCATION_002] only. 
Subjects who have severe allergies to penicillins or cephalosporins cannot participate in this sub -study 
cohort.
Safety Information: Summary safety tables from the Dose Escalation Cohort (Cohort 1) m eetings will 
be shared with all investigators participating in both cohorts (escalation and expansion). These tables 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1073092] dose escalation for Cohorts 1 and 2 : 
In the dose escalation cohort  (Cohort 1), if the su bjects on 20 mg and 40 mg dose levels do not 
achieve a composite CR (CRc), defined as either of CR, CRp or CRi, after one cycle of treatment and 
did not have DLT, they may dose escalate to the next dose level. 
In the dose expansion cohort (Cohort 2), subj ects who do not achieve a CRc may dose escalate to the 
next dose level, if the next dose level has opened up for expansion (i.e., a decision has been made to 
escalate to next higher dosing level). 
Subjects who dose escalate will revert to more frequent sa fety evaluations [Section 5.1.2].
Continuation of Subjects in open label roll over study:
Should the Sponsor make the decision to end the study after primary analysis, all subjects receiving 
ASP2215 may be enrolled in an ASP2215 rollover study (2215 -CL-0109).  Subjects must not meet 
any discontinuation criteria for this study and must meet the entry criteria for the rollover study prior 
to being enrolled.  
Subjects who choose not to participate or are not eligible for Study 2215 -CL-0109 will complete their 
participation in Study 2215 -CL-0101 by [CONTACT_780648] 2215- CL-0109 at the institution.
Subjects, who are being followed for Long -term Follow -up at the time of study closure, will be 
discontinued.

Exploratory:
Statistical Methods: 
Sample Size Justification: 
The sample size is not based on statistical power calculation. It should provide adequate information 
for the objective of the study.
Bayesian Logistic Regression Modeling in Dose Escalation and Expansion Phases:
A modified 3+3 design with an accelerated titration is applied in the dose escalation cohort as 
described in the Study Design Overview section. A 2 -parameter Bayesian log istic regression will be 
used to model the dose -toxicity relationship on DLT. Subjects in either dose escalation cohort or dose 
expansion cohorts will be included in the model -fitting process to provide the complete safety 
information. The estimated DLT rates based on the Bayesian logistic regression model for each dose 
level will be provided as references for dose escalation procedures in dose escalation cohort and 
safety monitoring in dose expansion cohort. If the DLT rate for an expanded dose level is eq ual or 
higher than 20% with a posterior probability of 80%, then the enrollment to the dose level will be 
paused and the safety will be reassessed.
Subject Assignment in Cohort 2 Dose Expansion Cohort:
As a dose level is decided to be expanded, up to 17 su bjects will be enrolled for the dose level in the 
dose expansion cohort (to have a total of 20 subjects enrolled at a dose level including the subjects 
from dose escalation cohort). When more than one dose levels are expanded in the dose expansion 
cohort ( 2), the newly enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of the open expanded dose levels, 
based on the relative chance of (20 –n) in each dose level, where n is the number of subjects already 
enrolled in the dose level.

Further Expansion for Efficacy Evaluation
To improve gu idance for Recommended Phase 2 Dose, dose levels at and above 120 mg will be 
further expanded (when found to be tolerable in Cohort 1) based on the efficacy results observed in 
escalation and expansion cohorts. Approximately 40 additional subjects will be enrolled at these dose 
levels to bring the total enrolled to approximately 60 patients at the dose level inclusive of Cohort 1 
subjects. A minimum of 42 evaluable (receive 2 cycles of treatment or discontinue for progressive 
disease) FLT3 mutated patients will be enrolled.
The increased patient numbers will enable us to more accurately estimate the actual response rate 
(CRc) for a dose level based on the observed response rate.  With approximately 42 evaluable FLT3 
mutated subjects, the 90% 1 -sided Confidence Interval is about 10% below the observed response rate 
for each dose level. If the estimated response rate is 50%, we would be 90% sure that the real 
response rate is higher than 40%. Response rate will be continuously monitored for each dose level 
andthe enrollment will be stopped if the response rate for that dose level is at 90% significance level, 
less than 45% based on Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test with 25% as the unacceptable low 
response rate and 80% power. 
The following table will a pply (e.g., if 7 or less subjects respond as 25 FLT3 mutated subjects 
complete 2 cycles of treatment in a dose level, the enrollment at the dose level will be stopped):

Safety Analyses:
Safety analyses will consist of data summaries of AEs, DLTs, and other safety parameters. The 
number and percent of subjects experiencing 1 or more AE(s) will be summarized by [CONTACT_780650]. The relationship to study drug, time of onset, and severity of AE will also be summarized. AEs 
will be coded to system organ class and preferred term using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) terminology.
Laboratory parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_780651], and data listings of clinically significant abnormalities. Vital signs and ECG 
parameters and their changes from baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_780652]: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1073111] number 2014 -002217 -31

Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 11 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Back ground
AML  accounts for approximately  80% of acute leukemias diagnosed in adults. The median 
age at diagnosis is 66 y ears. I t is estimated that 13,780 people (7,350 men and 6,430 women) 
will be diagnosed with AML , and 10,200 will die from the disease in 2012 in the United 
States. [Howlader, 2011]. While 60% to 80% of younger patients achieve a complete 
remission with standard therap y, onl y about 20% to 30% of the overall patient population has 
long-term disease -free survival. Outcomes are w orse for patients aged 60 y ears or over, with 
complete remission rates in the range of 40% to 55% and poor long -term survival rates.
Along with age, remission rates and overall survival depend on a number of other factors, 
including cy togenetics, previous bone marrow disorders (such as m yelod ysplastic sy ndromes) 
and co -morbidities. Currently , there is no effective cure for the disease.
FLT3 is a member of the class III receptor t yrosine kinase famil y that is normally  expressed 
on the surface of hematopoietic progenitor cells. FLT3 and its ligand play an important role 
in proliferation, survival, and differentiation of multipotent stem cells. FLT3 is over 
expressed in the majority of AML cases. In addition, activated FLT3 with internal tandem 
duplication (ITD ) at juxtamembrane domain and ty rosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations at 
around D835 in the activation loop are present in 25% to 30% and 5% to 10% of AML cases, 
respectivel y [Schlenk, 2009]. These activated mutations in FLT3 are oncogenic, and show 
transfo rming activit y in cells [Yamamoto, 2001]. Furthermore, patients with these activated 
FLT3 show poor prognosis [Yanada, 2005].
Axl is a member of TAM family  (Tyro-3, Axl, and Mer) receptor t yrosine kinases and is 
normally  expressed in cells of mesenchy mal o rigin, such as osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and blood 
cells.  Axl has been reported to be overexpressed or activated in man y cancers, including acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) [L inger 2008]. Axl overexpression in AML  confers drug resistance 
[Hong 2008] and is associated with adverse prognosis [Rochlitz 1999 and Ben- Batalla 2013]. 
Axl inhibition suppresses the growth of human FLT3 -positive AML  in vivo [Park 2013]. 
Finally , Axl inhibition is also active in FLT3
-negative (but Axl expressing) AML  in vivo 
[Ben -Batall a 2013].
ASP2215 hemifumarate is a new chemical entit y (NCE) discovered b y Astellas Pharma Inc. 
in collaboration with  ASP2215 has an inhibitory  effect on 
tyrosine kinases, mainly  FLT3, Axl and ALK. ASP2215 demonstrated favorable efficacy  in a 
non-clinical AML model, which means complete regression of tumors in the xenograft model 
mice transplanted with MV4- 11, human AML cell line expressing FLT3 -ITD, by [CONTACT_780657]. In addition, ASP2215 inhibited the growth of cells expressing either wild ty pe 
FLT3, FLT3- ITD, FLT3 -D835Y, or FLT3
-ITD-D835Y.

luminescent cell viability assay  (CellTiter- Glo™), where MV4 -11 cells were exposed to 
ASP2215 for 5 days. 
ASP2215 inhibited the growth of MV4- 11 cells with an I C50value of 0.92 nmol/L .
Inhibitory  effect of A SP2215 on phosphory lation of FLT3 in MV4- 11 cells [2215 -PH-0010]
The inhibitory  effect of ASP2215 on phosphory lation of FLT3 in MV4- 11 cells was 
evaluated.  ASP2215 was added to the wells containing MV4 -11 cells to achieve final 
concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1 , and 10 nmol/L . At 2 hours after addition of ASP2215, the amount 
of phosphory lated FLT3 was anal yzed by [CONTACT_459017][INVESTIGATOR_780628] -blotting. Signals 
for FLT3 and phosphory lated FLT3 were detected using a CCD camera and quantified using 
ImageQuant TL software. The signals for phosphory lated FLT3 were normalized using those 
for FLT3. The mean percentage of phosphory lated FLT3 relative to control was calculated.
In MV4 -11 cells, ASP2215 at 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 nmol/L  resulted in FLT3 phosphory lation of 
100% , 86%, 19%, and 7%, respectively  [Figure 2].

[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics
In vitro metabolic activity of ASP2215 in recombinant human cy tochrome P450 Enzy mes 
[2215 -ME-0001] 
In vitro metabolism studies using recombinant human CYP- expressing microsomes indicated 
that the main CYP isozy me involved in the metabolism of ASP2215 was estimated to be 
CYP3A4.
In vitro metabolic fingerprinting of ASP2215 [2215- ME-0002]
In vitro metabolic fingerprinting of ASP2215 inpooled liver microsomes and cry opreserved 
hepatocy tesusing [14C]ASP2215 hemifumarate indicated that a ll metabolite peaks of  
[14C]ASP2215 -derived radioactivity  detected in human liver microsomes and hepatocy tes 
were also found in those of at least one other species , suggesting that no human -specific 
ASP2215 metabolites were formed b y liver microsomes or hepatocy tes.
In vitro plasma protein binding of ASP2215 in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkey s, and 
humans [2215- ME-0010]
The plasma protein binding ratios of ASP2215 at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 mcg/mL as

Inhibitory  effect of ASP2215 on the MDR1 -mediated transport, and transcellular transport of 
ASP2 215 in human MDR1 expressing cells [2215- ME-0011]
ASP2215 is a substrate for P -gp. Although ASP2215 has the potential of P -gp inhibition, its 
potential was not so strong and the IC 50was more than 30 mcmol/L .
Inhibitory  effect of ASP2215 on the human MATE1 -and MATE2-K-mediated transport 
[2215 -ME-0020]
ASP2215 showed inhibitory  effect on MATE1 -mediated [14C] metformin transport and 
MATE2 -K-mediated [14C]metformin transport in a concentration dependent manner. The 
IC50 values of ASP2215 were calculated to be 0.0543 μmol/L  and 47.7 μmol/L , respectivel y.

Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 [IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical Toxicology
Single dose toxicity  study  [2215 -TX-0001]
In the single oral dose toxicity  study  in rats, the approximate lethal dose level was 300 mg/kg
for males and females. The major change was a gastrointestinal hemorrhagic disorder at
100and 300 mg/kg. Reversibility  of the changes noted in the surviving animals was seen.
Repeated dose toxicity  studies [2215 -TX-3004, 2215- TX-0002, 2215 -TX-0003]
In the 1 -week oral repeated dose toxicity  study  in rats, interstitial pneumonia in the lung and
vacuolar change in the rod- cone lay er of the retina were observed in a male at 30 mg/kg. In
the 13- week oral repeated dose toxicity  study  in rats, deaths occurred at 20 mg/kg/day  in both
sexes. Target organ toxi city was identified in the gastrointestinal tract, immune sy stem, bone
marrow, ey e, lung, kidney , and liver. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was
lower than 2.5 mg/kg/day  for males and females because low body  weight was noted in
males and effe cts on the immune sy stem (low l ymphocy tes and serum gamma -globulin ratio,
and low spleen weight) were noted in females. The changes noted during the dosing period
recovered or tended to recover during the 4 -week recovery  period. The severel y toxic dose in
10% of the animals (STD 10) in rats was considered to be 20 mg/kg/day . In the 4 -week oral
repeated dose stud y in dogs, deaths or moribund sacrifices occurred in males at 10 mg/kg/day  
(1 out of 4 animals), 100 mg/kg/day  (all 7 animals), and 1000 mg/kg/day  (6out of 7 animals). 
Target organ toxicity was identified in the gastrointestinal tract, immune sy stem, bone 
marrow, ey e, kidney , and liver. The NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/day  for males and females since 
decreased bod y weight, increased aspartate aminotransferase (A ST) and thy mic atrophy  in 
males, ly mphocy te necrosis in the mesenteric l ymph node in females, and a positive fecal 
occult blood reaction and increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in both sexes were observed 
at 2.5 mg/kg/day  and higher. Reversibility  of the test article -related changes was indicated at 
the end of the 4- week recovery  period. The highest non -severel y toxic dose (HNSTD) in 
dogs was considered to be 5mg/kg/day .
Genotoxicity  studies [2215- TX-3008, 2215- TX-3009, 2215 -TX-3010, 2215 -TX-3011, 
2215 -TX-0004, 2215 -TX-0005]
ASP2215 induced gene mutation in bacteria in the screening in vitro reversion test but the 
extent of the increase in the number of revertant colonies was marginal and the
dose-relationship was unclear. On the other hand, ASP2215 did not induce gene mutation in 
the definitive in vitro reversion test in bacteria. Therefore, it was concluded that ASP2215 
does not have a potential to induce gene mutation. Although ASP2215 induced micronuclei 
in the screening in vitro micronucleus test, it did not induce chromosomal aberrations in the 
definitive in vitro chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells. The positive results in the 
screening test were obtained only  atconcentrations where evaluation could not be done due 
to cy totoxicity  in the definitive study .It was concluded that ASP2215 does not have potential 
to induce chromosomal aberrations in vitro. The screening in vivo micronucleus test showed 
thatASP2215 has a potential to induce chromosomal aberrations in mice. Based on the 
results of the battery  of genotoxicity  studies above, it was concluded that ASP2215 has a 
potential to induce genotoxicity  
in vivo .

ASP2215 hemifumarate showed no effects on the central nervous s ystem in rats at 10 mg/kg . 
At 30 mg/kg and higher, decreased urination was noted. I n addition, at 100 mg/kg, decreased 
defecation was noted.
ASP2215 hemifumarate did not show any  effect on the cardiovascular or respi[INVESTIGATOR_780631] 100 mg/kg, or on the central nervous system at 1 mg/kg. At 3 mg/kg and higher, 
the following signs were noted: retching at 3 mg/kg, vomiting and positive fecal occult blood 
at 10 mg/kg and higher, a decrease in the blood Ca+2concentration at 30 mg/kg, and 
salivation and an increase followed by a decrease in the blood Ca+2concentration at 
100mg/kg. All of the findings recovered.
In the single oral dose toxicity  study  in rats, the approximate lethal dose level was 300 mg/kg 
for males and females. The major change was a gastrointestinal hemorr hagic disorder at 
100and 300 mg/kg. Reversibility  of the changes noted in the surviving animals was seen. No 
single oral dose toxicity  study  in dogs was conducted. In the 4- week toxicity  study  in dogs, a 
dose of 1000 mg/kg/day  caused deaths and moribund sacrifices on Day 2. The cause of death

were observed. The lens opacity  and inflammatory  changes were reversible. In addition, the 
changes were observed only  at the highest dose level in each study  which was MTD or 
beyond MTD with low incidence. Therefore, these changes would not indicate a significant 
risk in clinical studies. I n dogs, at the highest dose level of 5 mg/kg/day , abnormal fundus

A total of 112 (72.7%) of the patients developed at least one serious TEAE. The most 
commonly  reported serious TEAE (occurring in at least 5% of patients) include febrile 
neutropenia ( 27.3%), sepsis (13.0%), AML (9.7%), pneumonia (6.5%), hypotension (5.8%), 
and diarrhea (5.2%) .Of the serious TEAEs, 31 (20.1%) patients had serious TEAEs that were 
considered b y the Investigators to be at least possibly  related to ASP2215. Drug -related 
serious TEAEs that occurred in 2 more patients include febrile neutropenia (1.9%), diarrhea 
and abnormal liver function test (1.3% each).  The most commonly  reported drug-related 
serious TEAEs occurred in the MedDRA Sy stem Organ Class of Infections and infestations 
(bacteraemia, diverticulitis, sepsis, and urosepsis) and Blood and l ymphatic sy stem disorders 
(anemia, febrile neutropenia, hemoly tic anemia).
After the data cutoff, 1 patient in the 200 mg dose group developed altered mental status and 
1epi[INVESTIGATOR_255127] (PRES). ASP2215 was discontinued and the patient’s sy mptoms resolved.  
Additionally , 1 case of rhabdomy olysis with associated CK elevations was reported in a patient 
in the 300 mg dose group. Both SAEs were considered DLTs.
At doses of 120 mg/day  and higher, moderate increases (grade 2) in creatinine kinase were 
seen in 10 of 59 patients (17%). One patient (1.6%) had severe (grade 3) elevati on in creatinine 
kinase. For CK, 21 (13.6%) of patients experienced a shift of 2 grades or higher, and these 
shifts appeared to increase with increasing dose.  For ALT, 19 (12.3%) patients experienced a 
shift of [ADDRESS_1073180], 19 (12.3%) pat ients experienced a shift of 2 grades or 
higher.
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment
Approximately  30% of adult AML  patients are refractory  to induction therapy . Furthermore, 
of those who achieve CR, approximately  75% will relapse. Generally , there is no established 
standard for these patients and less than 20% will achieve CR with subsequent treatment.  
The response duration for patients who achieve CR with subsequent treatment is limited and 
most of the patients relapse. Patients who are in 2ndrelapse or refractory  to 1stsalvage have 
an extremely  poor prognosis, with survival measured in weeks. 
Some of the issues with other FLT3 inhibitor compounds are their short duration of disease 
control due to point mutations, prolonged m yelosupression and corrected QT interva l (QTc) 
prolongation. 
ASP2215 inhibits FL T3-ITD and FLT3 point mutations (D835). FLT3 is over
-expressed in 
the majority  of AML cases. There are activating FLT3 mutations in approximately  35% of 
AML  cases. These mutations increase the transforming activit y and decrease the progn osis 
for AML patients. 
ASP2215 showed no significant findings in the safety  pharmacology  studies. I n the repeated 
dose toxicity  studies with rats and dogs, mortality  was shown and all major findings were

2 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S), DESIGN, AND ENDPOINT S
2.1 Study Objectives
2.1.1 Primary Objectives
●Assess the safet y and tolerability , including determination of the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) of oral ASP2215 in subjects with relapsed or treatment -refractory  AML.
●Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ASP2215. 
2.1.2 Secondary Obje ctives
●Investigate the anti- leukemic activity  of various doses of ASP2215 in subjects with AML. 
●Evaluate the effect of strong or moderate cy tochrome P450 -isozy me3A4 (CYP3A4) 
inhibitors on the PK of ASP2215.
●Evaluate the potential induction of CYP3A4 by  [CONTACT_106346]2215 by  [CONTACT_780643].
●Evaluate the effect of ASP2215 on MATE1 substrates by  [CONTACT_780644].
2.[ADDRESS_1073182] will receive oral ASP2215 daily . The study treatment will continue 
until one of the discontinuation criteria is met or until r ollover into the 2215- CL-0109 study . 
The starting dose level of ASP2215 is 20 mg daily and the decision to dose escalate to the next 
dose level will be made based on the assessment of safet y variables including occurrence of 
grade 2 adverse events (AE) or DLTs.  
This study  will have two cohorts of subjects [ Figure 4and Figure 5]:
●Cohort 1: Dose escalation cohort
●Cohort 2: Dose expansion cohort
Cohort 1 
Cohort 1 will comprise the initial dose escalation cohort with up to 10 dose levels [ Table 5]. 
This cohort will be run at approximately  5 centers which will only  participate in the dose 
expansion cohort (Cohort 2) if the enrollment in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1) is on a 
pause (i.e., dose level being tested at the time is fully  enrolled and the one higher dose level 
has not y et been opened) . Subjects will be treated daily  in 28 day  cycles (with the exception 
of Cy cle1 where subjects will receive 29 doses). The DLT observation period is [ADDRESS_1073183] 28 day  treatment cy cle. 
Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1073184] cy cleand after 
receiving a single dose of the study  drug on Day -2. 
This study  will follow an accelerated titration design. Dose levels are set at around 50% 
increments. One subject will be treated at the starting dose level of [ADDRESS_1073185] will be enrolled at double the dose level, i.e., dos e level 3 (40 mg 
see Table 5). This dose escalation approach will continue wherein onl y odd numbered dose 
levels (1, 3, 5) are tested until the first instance of a DLT or second instance (observed in two 
subjects at an y of these dose levels) of a grade 2 AE judged related (e.g., possibly , probabl y, or 
definitely ) by [CONTACT_7185] (except for hematologic toxicities) 
occur.  
When a DLT or second instance (observed in two subjects) of grade [ADDRESS_1073186], the dose escalation schedule will stop the double -dose level method 
and follow the next consecutive dose level in Table 5 utilizing the modified 3+3 design. 
Modified 3+3 design testing each consecutive dose level may  also be followed if recommended 
by [CONTACT_780659].  After dose level 5 
(80mg), ea ch subsequent dose level (6 -10) will be tested using the 3+3 design. In this phase, 3 
subjects will be treated at each dose level. If no DLTs are observed, the subsequent subjects 
will be treated at the next dose level. If one DLT is observed in a dose lev el, 3 more subjects 
will be enrolled at that dose level. If the 3 additional subjects do not experience a DLT, the 
next dose level will be initiated. If 2 or more DLTs occur in a dose level, DLT will be 
established. The next lower dose level will be declar ed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
Subject replacement in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1)
A subject that receives less than 80% of the intended dose during C ycle 1 (e.g., misses 
6daily  doses or leaves the study  for reasons other than a DLT), will not be evaluable for 
DLT and will be replaced by  [CONTACT_780646]. In addition, if after enrollment 
any subject is found not to fulfill any  inclusion/exclusion criteria that would adversel y affect 
safet y or efficacy evaluation of that subject, they  may  be replaced after discussion between 
the Principal Investigator [CONTACT_73651].
Cohort 2
Cohort 2 is the dose expansion cohort. This cohort will be conducted at approximately  
35additional centers that will not participate in the dose es calation cohort (Cohort 1). 
However, those centers participating in Cohort 1 may  participate in Cohort 2 after the 
completion of the dose escalation phase (Cohort 1). Cohort 1 centers may  also enroll patients 
in Cohort 2 if the enrollment in Cohort 1 is on a pause (i.e., dose level being tested at the time 
is fully  enrolled and the one higher dose level has not y et been opened). Subjects will be 
treated dail y in 28 day cycles. The DLT observation period is based on one completed 
cyclestarting with the firs t dose taken on C1D1.

Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 1In the dose expansion phase (Cohort 2), a dose level may  be expanded as follows: 
●If one subject in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1) at any  dose level achieves complete 
remission (CR), complete remission with low platelets (CRp) or complete remission with 
incomplete hematologic recovery  (CRi) then this dose level will continue to enroll a 
minimum of 3 subjects. After the decision is made to escalate to the next dose level (0/3 or 
1/6 DL Ts observed), the dose level will be expande d to enroll up to 17 additional subjects. 
All subsequent dose levels will also be expanded following a dose escalation decision for 
the dose level in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1). When more than one dose levels are 
expanded in the dose expansion c ohort (Cohort 2), the newl y enrolled patients will be 
randomized to all open expanded dose levels ).
●In the absence of a CRc, if the median decrease of FMS -like ty rosine kinase (FLT3) 
phosphory lation in plasma inhibitory  assay  (PIA) is equal or greater than 90% in a dose 
level with at least 3 subjects, then this dose level and the subsequent levels will be 
expanded following a dose escalation decision for the dose level (0/3 or 1/6 DL Ts 
observed) in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1).
Subjects will be ass igned in the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1) or randomized in the dose 
expansion cohort (Cohort 2) to one of the open dose levels as defined in the statistical 
methodology  section [Section 7]. At least 10 subjects with FLT3 mutations (ITD or 
activating point mutations) will be enrolled to each expanded dose level (including the 
subjects in the dose escalation cohort). Dose levels at and above 120 mgwill be further 
expanded (when found to be tolerable in Cohort 1) based on the efficacy  results observed in 
escalation and expansion cohorts as described in the Statistical section. At least 42 evaluable 
subjects with FLT3 mutations will be enrolled in dose levels selected for further expansion 
[Figure 5].  The safet y in the dose expansion cohort (Cohort 2) will be monitored using 
Bayesian logistic reg ression modeling, as described in Section 7
, based on the DLT rate 
observed in subjects from both the dose escalation and expansion cohorts. In the dose 
expansion cohort (Cohort 2), and for the first dose level only , the effect of CYP3A4 
inhibition for strong inhibitor voriconazole (Schedule 2B) will be evaluated in all subjects in 
the dose level. In the dose expansion cohort (Cohort 2), and at the h ighest dose level of 
ASP2215 (MTD or one level below MTD), the effect of ASP2215 on midazolam 
pharmacokinetics (Schedule 2D) will be evaluated. After completion of the CYP3A4 
inhibition expansion (Schedule 2B) and until MTD is determined, Cohort 2 subjects will 
participate without the DDI component (Schedule 2C). DDI studies (Schedules 2B, 2D and 
2E) will be conducted in the [LOCATION_002] only .  European sites whose patients are 
randomized to the DDI arms of the study  will follow Schedule 2C and will not ad minister 
their patients these medications. In addition, US sites approved b y the sponsor to join the trial 
who cannot conduct the DDI portion of the trial will also be allowed to follow Schedule 2C 
even if patients are randomized to Schedule 2B or 2D.
Patients who have a contraindication to voriconazole or midazolam can participate in the trial 
without the DDI component (Schedule 2C) after discussion with the medical monitor.

To further evaluate drug -drug interaction (DDI), a sub -study  with a MATE1 substrate will be 
conducted [ Table 2E].  This cohort will have approximately  [ADDRESS_1073189] of ASP2215 on the MATE1 
transporter.  The pharmacokinetics of 500 mg cephalexin will be investigated prior to 
initiation of ASP2215 treatment at Cy cle1 Day -1 and at Day 15 of Cy cle1.  This DDI sub-

Intra -subject dose escalation for Cohorts 1 and 2:  
In the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1), if the subjects on 20 mg and 40 mg dose levels do 
not achieve a composite CR (CRc), defined as either of CR, CRp or CRi, after [ADDRESS_1073190] DLT, they  may  dose escalate to the next dose level. 
In the dose expansion cohort (Cohort 2), subjects who do n ot achieve a CRc may  dose 
escalate to the next dose level, if the next dose level has opened up for expansion (i.e., a 
decision has been made to escalate to next higher dosing level). 
Subjects who dose escalate will revert to more frequent safet y evaluations [Section 5.1.2].
Continuation of Subjects in open label roll over study :
Should the Sponsor make the decision to end the study  after pri mary  anal ysis, all subjects 
receiving ASP2215 may  be enrolled in an ASP2215 rollover study  (2215 -CL-0109).  
Subjects must not meet any  discontinuation criteria for this study  and must meet the entry

Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 12.2.2 Dose Rationale
ASP2215 has been tested in numerous pre -clinical studies. I n the repeated dose toxicity  
studies, deaths due to deteriorated general conditions occurred at 20 and 10 mg/kg/day  in rats 
and dogs, respectively . Target organs were the gastrointestinal tract, immune sy stem, ey e,liver, 
kidney , lung and/or bone marrow in rats and dogs at ASP2215 doses at 2.5 mg/kg/day  or more. 
All major findings were reversible and monitorable. STD 10and HNSTD were 20 and 
5mg/kg/day  in rats and dogs, respectivel y. Human equivalent doses based on body  surface

4.1.[ADDRESS_1073209] Drug(s)
ASP2215 is an oral tablet that is available in a 10 mg tablet or a 100 mg tablet. The tablets 
are contained within blister cards. 
There will be a total of 140 tablets per carton ([ADDRESS_1073210]). The 
study  site personnel will fill out the sub carton dispensing label to indicate the subject's 
ASP2215 dose and the corresponding number of tablets that need to be taken each day . 
Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1073211] or Sponsor’s designee in accordance with 
APGD -AUST or Sponsor’s designee Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Good 
Manufacturing P ractice (GMP) guidelines, ICH GCP guidelines, and applicable local 
laws/regulations.
Each blister pack and bottle will bear a label conforming to regulatory  guidelines, GMP and 
local laws and regulations which identifies the contents as investigational dru g.
The study  centers will be provided cartons containing 10 - 2x7 blisters cards. Blistered 
ASP2215 should be stored between (2◦C to 8◦C) and protected from light, with excursions in 
the temperature permitted from (0◦C to 15◦C).  Temperature logs are to be maintained by  [CONTACT_780660]  (at minimum).
Study  centers will be provided bottles containing 30 tablets of ASP2215 10 mg, 40 mg or 
100mg. Bottled ASP2215 should be stored at room temperature between 20°C and 25°C 
(68°F and 77°F) and protected from light in a tight container, with excursions in temperature 
permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).  
4.3 Study Drug Handling 
Current ICH GCP Guidelines require the investigator to ensure that stud y drug deliveries 
from the Sponsor are received by  [CONTACT_093]/or designee and
●that such deliveries are recorded,

Platelets < 25 x 109/L and/or ANC ≤ 0.5 x 109/L;
Marrow blasts < 5%;
No evidence of extramedullary disease;
Further stepwise dose reduction is permitted if dosing 1 full cycle at the 
reduced dose has not resulted in the desired hematologic recovery.
Guidelines for dose escalation are provided in Table 7
In the dose escalation cohort (Cohort 1), if the subjects on 20 mg and 40 mg dose levels do 
not achieve a composite CR (CRc), defined as either of CR, CRp or CRi, after [ADDRESS_1073220] DLT, they  may  dose escalate to the next dose level. Only  one 
dose escalation is allowed for lack of response.
In the dose expansion cohort (Cohort 2), subjects who do not achieve a CRc may  dose escalate 
to the next dose level, if the next dose level has opened up for expansion (i.e., a decision has 
been made to escalate to next higher dosing level). After the initial dose escalation, additional 
dose escalations may  occur following the dose levels in Table 5if the next dose level has 
opened up for expansion (i.e., a decision has been made to escalate to next higher dosing level).

All medications and concomitant treatments administered from [ADDRESS_1073224] be recorded in the CRF. Documentation will include 
the medication name, indication, dose and dates of administration. Treatment with concomitant 
drugs that are strong inducers of CYP3A are prohibited.  Treatment with concomitant drugs 
that are strong inhibitors or inducers of P-gp and concomitant drugs that target serotonin 
5HT 1R or 5HT 2BR or sigma nonspecific receptor are to be avoided with the exception of drugs 
Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1073225] -transplant or to 
prevent or treat infections. If CYP3A inhibitors are used comcom itantl y, subjects should be 
closely  monitored for AEs.
Precaution should be used in treatment of ASP2215 with concomitant drugs that are substrates 
of BCRP, since the transporter has been shown to be inhibited by  A2215 in in vitro studies.
Common CYP3A inhi bitors, CYP3A inducers, drugs targeting the serotonin receptor P-gp 
inhibitors or inducers and drugs known to prolong QT or QTc intervals are listed 
[Appendix 12.1]. The investigator should consult individual labels for all drugs that the subject 
is taking to evaluate if they  fall into any  of the above named categories. For concomitant drugs 
that have the potential to prolong QT or QTc intervals, a cardiology  consul t should be obtained 
as medicall y indicated. Any other treatments of AML  (including but not limited to 
chemotherap y, radiotherapy , surgery , immunotherapy  or cellular therapy ) are prohibited during 
therap y with ASP2215 with the exception of hydrox yurea up t o 5g dail y for up to [ADDRESS_1073226] count below 50 x 109/L, prophy lactic intrathecal chemotherapy  or

5.3.1 Response Definitions
Response to treatment will be defined per modified Cheson criteria [2003] as outlined below.
[IP_ADDRESS] Composite Complete Remission Rate (CRc)
Defined as the confirmed remission rate of all complete and incomplete CRs ( i.e., CR+ CRp +Cri).
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete Remission (CR)
For subjects to be classified as being in CR, they  must have bone marrow regenerating normal 
hematopoietic cells and achieve a morphologic leukemia -free state and must have an absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) > 1 x 109/L and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and normal marrow 
differential with < 5% blasts, and they  will be red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion 
independent (defined as 1 week without RBC transfusion and 1 week without platelet 
transfusion). The re should be no evidence of extramedullary  leukemia .
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete Remission with Incomplete Platelet Recovery (CRp)
For subjects to be classified as being in CRp, they  must achieve CR except for incomplete 
platelet recovery  (< 100 109/L).
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete Remission with Incomplete Hematological Recovery (CRi)
For subjects to be classified as being in CRi, they  must fulfill all the criteria for CR except for 
incomplete hematological recovery  with residual neutropenia < 1109/L with or without 
complete platelet recov ery. RBC and platelet transfusion independence is not required.
[IP_ADDRESS] Partial Remission (PR)
For subjects to be classified as being in PR, they  must have bone marrow regenerating normal 
hematopoietic cells with evidence of peripheral recovery  with no (or only  a few regenerating) 
circulating blasts and with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts in the bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_559798] 5% and 25%.

Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 [IP_ADDRESS] Relapse
Relapse after CR, CRp or CRi is defined as a reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral 
blood or ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_780634].  
Relapse after PR is similarly  defined with reappearance of significant numbers of peripheral 
blasts and an increase in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_278581] > 25% not 
attributable to an y other cause or reappearance or new appearance of extramedullary leukemia.
[IP_ADDRESS] Best Response
Best response is defined as the best measured response (CR, CRp, CRi, or PR) post -treatment.
Two best responses, up to the time of 2 cy cles of treatment period and the End of Treatment 
Visit will be defined. 
5.4 Safety Assessment
5.4.1 Vital Signs
Vital signs, including s ystolic and diastolic blood pressures (mmHg), radial pulse rate 
(beats/minute), and temperature will be obtained and recorded at the times specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments. All vital sign measures will be obtained with the subject in the 
sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
If clinicall y sign ificant vital sign changes from baseline (pretreatment) are noted, the changes 
will be documented as AEs on the Adverse Event page of the CRF. Clinical significance will 
be defined as a variation in vital signs, which has medical relevance that could resul t in an 
alteration in medical care. The Investigator will continue to monitor the subject until the 
parameter returns to Grade ≤ 1, or to the baseline (pretreatment) value, or until the I nvestigator 
determines that follow up is no longer medicall y necessar y. 
5.4.2 Adverse Events
Adverse event collection will begin from time of informed consent and continue through the 
30 Day Follow -Up visit. Adverse events will be documented at each clinic visit, but can be 
collected at an y time. Any adverse event that meets the definition of an S AE will also be 
reported on a separate form to the Sponsor. See Section 5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safet y 
Aspects for information regarding adverse event collection and data handling.

Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 15.4.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
ECGs will be conducted at visits as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments. Pre-dose 
assessments should be taken within 0.[ADDRESS_1073242] dose assessments should be taken within ± 0.5 hours of nominal time. The 
12-lead ECGs will be recorded in triplicate ([ADDRESS_1073243] 5 minutes apart per 
timepoint) and transmitted electronically for central reading. 
ECGs should be obtained after the subject h as rested quietly  and is awake in a fully  supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251] (or semi-
recumbent, if supi[INVESTIGATOR_327695]) for [ADDRESS_1073244] ECG from 
a triplicate. Whenever a study  procedure coincides with the scheduled timepoint for an ECG 
triplicate, the study activities will ideally  be undertaken in a fixed sequence: ECG triplicate 
first, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) second, and an y type of blood draw as the last 
assessment. This order of events can be changed if required in order to accommodate PK time 
points and is not mandatory .
The mean QTcF of the triplicate ECG tracings based on central reading will be used for all 
treatment decisions.  A Cy cle 1 Day  8 ECG will be taken and the central read results will be 
provided to the site 24 hours afte r receipt of the tracing.  A confirmatory  ECG should be 
performed on C ycle 1 Day 9 if the mean QTcF from Cy cle 1 Day  1 to Cy cle 1 Day  8 has 
increased > [ADDRESS_1073245] to be contact[CONTACT_647332] C ycle 1 Day  9 ECG is

Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 15.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a s ubject administered a study  drug 
or has undergone study  procedures and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease te mporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets one of the 
following criteria:
●Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
●Requires active intervention
●Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  medication
●The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically  significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070].
Some countries may  have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in an expedited manner similar to an SAE. I n these cases, it is the 
investigator’s resp onsibility  to ensure these AEs or other reporting requirements are followed 
and the information is appropriatel y recorded in the (e)CRF accordingly.
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of eit her the investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any  of the following outcomes: 
●Results in death
●Is life threatening (an adverse event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death)
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal lif e functions 
●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
● Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious) 
●Other medicall y important events
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780635]. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, 
Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1073247] 2014 -002217 -31
-CONFIDENTIAL -
02 Jun 2017 Astellas Page 76of 133
Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 1should also usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
Safety  events of interest on the med icinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study  (e.g., stud y drug, comparator, background therap y) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
●Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
●Suspecte d abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
●Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product(s)
● Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject/patient 
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])
All of the events of interest noted above should be recorded on the (e)CRF. Any  situation 
involving these events of interest that also meets the criteria for an SAE should be recorded 
on the AE page of the (e)CRF and marked ‘serious’ and the SAE worksheet.
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an adverse 
event is reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “alway s serious”, 
additional information on the event may  be requested.   
5.5.3 Criter ia for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
Adverse events that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "adverse 
events whose relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out".
Causal relationship to 
the study drugCriteria f or causal relationship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and/or in  which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. Informati on 
on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or  other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response on re- administration (rechallenge) or 
withdrawal (dechallenge).

Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 15.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory  values, will be graded using the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) -Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) guidelines 
(Version 4.03). The items that are not stipulated in the NCI- CTCAE Version 4.03 will be 
assessed according to the criteria below and entered into the eCRF:
Grade Assessment Standard
1-Mild Asymptomatic, or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations noted; 
intervention not indicated.
2-Moderate Local or noninvasive intervention indicated.
3-Severe Medically significant but not immediately life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255130].
4-Life Threatening Life threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated
5-Death Death related to AE
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

period or within 120 days from the discontinuation of dosing, the investigator should report the 
information to the Sponsor /delegated CRO as if it is anSAE. The expe cted date of delivery  or 
expected date of the end of the pregnancy , last menstruation, estimated conception date, 
pregnancy  result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this information.
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother , as well as the fetus, as if the 
pregnancy  is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor.
When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAEs [spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y (including anomaly  in a 
miscarried fetus)], the investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure 
for SAEs. Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  (which is 
categorized as an SAE) is mentioned below.
●"Spontaneous abor tion"includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion
●Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study  drug
● If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reporte d if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as " possible "by 
[CONTACT_093]
●In the case of a delivery  of a living newborn, the "normality "of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth
●Unless a congenital anomaly are identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, 
the embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects b y visual examination
If during the conduct of a clinical trial, a male subject makes his partner pregnant, the subject 
should repor t the pregnancy  to the investigator. The investigator will report the pregnancy  to

The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  [CONTACT_201451] -US. 
TheStatistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the anal ysis, along 
with specifications for tables, listings and figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized 
before the database soft lock at the latest. An y changes from the anal yses planned in SAP 
will be detailed in the Clinical Study  Report (CSR).
Prior to Database Lock, a Final Review of Data and TLFs Meeting will be held to allow a 
review of the clinical trial data and to verify  the data that will be used for analy sis set 
classification. If required, consequences for the statistical anal ysis will be discussed and 
documented.  A meeting to determine anal ysis set classifications may  also be held prior to 
database lock.
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive sta tistics (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and 
frequency  and percentage for categorical endpoints.
7.1 Sample Size
The sample size is not based on statistical power calculation. I t should provi de adequate 
information for the objective of the study .
Up to 40 subjects are planned to be enrolled into up to 10 dose levels in the dose escalation 
phase depending on the number of dose levels studied. The dose expansion phase will enroll up 
to 250 subje cts in the expansion cohort depending on the number of dose levels expanded. The 
total number of subjects estimated for enrollment is between 2 and 270 subjects. This excludes 
consideration of the replacement of subjects in the Dose Escalation Cohort (Coho rt 1) that 
meet the replacement criteria, in which case the sample size would increase based on the 
number of subjects replaced.

The full anal ysis set will consist of all subject s who are enrolled and receive at least one dose 
of study  drug and who have at least one post- treatment data point . This will be the primary  
analysis set for efficacy  analy ses.
7.2.2 Per Protocol Set (PPS)
The per protocol set will consist of the subset of the F AS who do not meet criteria for PPS 
exclusion. These criteria are to capture relevant non-adherence to the protocol and will be 
defined in the SAP. The PPS will be a secondary  anal ysis set for efficacy  analy ses.

For the statistic al summary  of the safet y data, the safet y analysis set (SAF) will be used. The 
SAF consists of all subjects who took at least one dose of study  medication, and will be used 
for safety  anal yses.
7.2.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS)
The pharmacokinetic analy sis set (PKAS) consists of the subset of the SAF population for 
which sufficient plasma concentration data is available to facilitate derivation of at least one 
PK parameter and for whom the time of dosing on the day  of sampling is known. Additional 
subject s may  be excluded from the PKAS at the discretion of the pharmacokineticist. Any  
formal definitions for exclusion of subjects or time- points from the PKAS will be 
documented in the in the Classification Specifications and determined the Classification 
Meet ing. 
7.2.5 Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set (PDAS) 
The pharmacod ynamic analysis set (PDAS) will include the subjects from the SAF 
population for whom sufficient pharmacod ynamic measurements were collected The PDAS 
will be used for all analyses of pharmacod ynamic d ata.

The frequency  of concomitant medications (prescription, over -the-counter, and nutritional 
supplements) will be summarized by  [CONTACT_9084], dose and preferred term for SAF. Medications 
will be coded using the WHO drug dictionary . Medications will be counted by  [CONTACT_780664]. A subject taking the same medication multiple times will 
only be counted once for that medication. Medications will be presented in decreasing order of 
frequency  based on the total number of subjects who took each medication.

7.3.7 Extent of Exposure
Exposure to treatment, measured b y the duration of treatment in number of day s will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_780667]. Duration of exposure to a study  drug is defined as: (the last 
date that subject took study  drug – the first dose date + 1). Any  duration of dose interruptions 
will be excluded from the exposure. The total dose administered, number of dose reductions, 
number of dose escalations , number and proportion of subjects with dose reduction and dose 
escalation will be tabulated.
7.4 Analysis of Efficacy 
Efficacy  anal ysis will be conducted on the FAS and PPS in which FAS will be considered as 
primary  and PPS as supportive.
7.4.1 Analysis of Effica cy Variables
Complete remission (CR) rate, composite complete remission rate, overall response rate, 
duration of confirmed response, disease -free survival (DFS), event free survival (EFS) and 
overall survival (OS), will be summarized using descriptive stat istics. The survival curve and 
median for time -to-event variables will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method and will 
be reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.
To explore the relationship between dose level and CR response a do se-response model 
(logistic regression) will be fitted to the binary  CR response with ITD mutation status, the 
first and second order of logarithm transformed dose as independent covariates for all 
subjects from the Dose Escalation Cohort and Dose Expansio n Cohort. The CR response rate 
for each dose level will be estimated with two -sided 95% CI from this model.

Version 1 2.0, Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1 17.5.1 Bayesian Logistic Regression Modeling in Dose Escalation and Expansion 
Phases
A modified 3+3 design with an accelerated titration is applied in the dose escalation cohort as 
described in the Study Design Overview section [Section 2]. A [ADDRESS_1073283] one treatment 
cycleor experience DLTs will be included in the model -fitting process to provide the 
complete safety  information. The estimated DLT rates based on the Bay esian logistic 
regression model for each dose level will be provided as references for dose escalation 
procedures in dose escalation cohort and safet y monitoring in dose expansion cohort. If the 
DLT rate for an expanded dose level is equal or higher than 20% with a posterior probability  
of 80%, then the enrollm ent to the dose level will be paused and the safety  will be reassessed.
7.5.[ADDRESS_1073284] Assignment in Cohort 2 Dose Expansion Cohort
As a dose level is decided to be expanded, up to 17 subjects will be enrolled for the dose 
level in the dose expansion phase (to have a total of 20 subjects enrolled at a dose level 
including the subjects from dose escalation cohort). When more than one do se levels are 
expanded in the dose expansion cohort (Cohort 2), the newl y enrolled subjects will be 
randomized to one of the open expanded dose levels, based on the relative chance of (20 –n) 
in each dose level, where n is the number of subjects alread y e
nrolled in the dose level, 
including both the dose escalation and expansion phases. 
If 10 subjects without FLT3 mutations (I TD or activating point mutations) are enrolled into 
an expanded dose level (including the subjects in the dose escalation cohort an d dose 
expansion cohort), only  subjects with FLT3 mutations can be enrolled to the dose level.
Any dose level in the dose expansion cohort will be stopped if no CRc is achieved in more 
than 6 subjects who complete 2 treatment cy cles or less than 2 CRcs in more than 12 subjects 
are achieved.
Further Expansion for Efficacy Evaluation
To improve guidance for Recommended Phase 2 Dose, dose levels at and above 120 mg will 
be further expanded (when found to be tolerable in Cohort 1) based on the efficacy  results 
observed in escalation and expansion cohorts. Approximately  40 additional Cohort 2 subjects 
will be enrolled at these dose levels to bring the total enrolled to approximately  60 patients at 
the dose level inclusive of Cohort 1 subjects. A minimum of 42 eva luable (receive 2 cy cles of 
treatment or discontinue for progressive disease) FLT3 mutated patients will be enrolled.
The increased patient numbers will enable us to more accurately  estimate the actual response 
rate (CRc) for a dose level based on the obse rved response rate. With approximately  
42evaluable FLT3 mutated subjects, the 90% 1 -sided Confidence Interval is about 10% below 
the observed response rate for each dose level. If the estimated response rate is 50%, we would 
be 90% sure that the real resp onse rate is higher than 40%. Response rate will be continuously  
monitored for each dose level and the enrollment will be stopped if the response rate for that 
dose level is at 90% significance level, less than 45% based on Wald’s Sequential Probability

may be considered an important medical event and may  be reported as a Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE). The Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_771410].
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Sy mptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘adverse events’ on the AE page of 
(e)CRF. Illnesses and conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac 
disease that may  lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Non -alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabet ic patients 
and may  be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels. The investigator should 
ensure that the medical history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment 
that may  be relevant in assessing hepatic function.
● Obtain a histo ry of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets. Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medication page of the ( e)CRF. Information on alcohol, other substance use, and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
●Based on the subject’s history , other testing may  be appropriate includi ng: 
oacute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents). 
oultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease
oother laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any additional testing and possible etiology on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as viral hepatitis, pre -existing or 
acute liver disease, presence of liver metastas es, or exposure to other agents associated with 
liver injury , the subject may  be discontinued from the study . The investigator may  determine 
that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue study  enrollment. Discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN

Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1073330]’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may  impact what treatment options 
are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx by  [CONTACT_190965][INVESTIGATOR_007], gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies 
(GWAS), the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy  or toxicity  may  
be better understood. As many  diseases may  be influenced b y one or more genetic variations, 
PGx research may  identify  which genes are involved in determining the way  a subj ect may  or 
may not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired buccal swab samples is 
exploratory . The objective of this research will be to analy zeor determine genes of relevance 
to clinical response, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity /safety  issues.
By [CONTACT_77816], it may  be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
SUBJECT PARTICIPATION
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study  may  participate in this 
PGx sub-study . As part of this sub- study , subjects must provide separate written consent prior 
to providing an y buccal swab samples that may be used at a later time for genetic analy sis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study  will provide a buccal swab per vendor 
preparation instructions. Each sample will be identified by [CONTACT_201459] (first 
code). Samples will be shipped to a designated banking CRO either directly from site or via a 
central laboratory  as directed by  [CONTACT_77818].
BANKING CRO STORAGE AND SAMPLE CODING 
Once received at the banking CRO, the samples will be assigned a unique sample code 
(second code) and store d frozen. A table linking the subject number (first code) with the 
newly -assigned sample code (second code) will be kept b y the banking CRO. PGx analy sis 
will be conducted using the second code onl y.
PGx ANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analy sis cannot be established y et. Astellas may  initiate the PGx 
analysis incase evidence suggests that genetic variants may  be influencing the drug’s 
kinetics, efficacy  and / or safety. Prior to initiating any  anal ysis on the banked samples, the 
Astellas ethical committee (AREC) must approve the anal ysis plan.

DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
For female subjects the period after study  participation during which the subject cannot 
become pregnant or donate ova is lengthened from [ADDRESS_1073335] use 
contraception and not donate sperm is lengthened from 105 day s to 120 day s.
For female subjects and female partners of male subjects, pregnancy  reporting is lengthened 
from 90 to 180 day s from the discontinuation of dosing .
RATIONALE:
Increased reproductive restrictions to ensure maximum protection against potential 
embry ofetal toxicity .  Reporting period increased to clarify  situation where female subject or 
partner of a male subject will be considered of non -child bearing potential.
No new patients will be enrolled under this version of the protocol; however, patients are still 
receiving treatment with ASP2215 under the study. Therefore, post discontinuati on 
requirements are provided.
4.Minor Administrative -type Changes
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: 
Include minor administrative -type changes, e.g., ty pos, format, numbering, consistency  
throughout the protocol.  
RATIONALE:
To provide clarifications to the protocol and to ensure complete understanding of stud y 
procedures.

Sample Size Justification:
The sample size was based on an estimate of precision. A sample size of 60 subjects will generate a 95% CI for 
endoscopic remission (defined a s SES -CD 0 -2) at Week 26 with a half width no wider than 12.7% and expected 
remission of 50%. If the expected remission rate is different from 50%, a required sample size would be smaller.

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Disease and Current Treatments
Inflammatory  bowel  disease (IBD) i s a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory  disorder of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract that includes 2 ent ities, namely ulcerat ive colit is (UC) and Crohn’s 
disease (CD). In contrast to the diffuse, superficial , conti nuous inflammat ion limited to the colon 
in UC, the inflammat ion of CD is focal, may be transmural, and can invo lve any segment of the GI 
tract from mouth to anus. The prevalence of CD is approximately 150/100,000 of the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) popul ation[1]. Thecharacteristic pathology invo lves a chronic inflammatory infiltrate 
consist ing of neutrophils and macrophages. Hallmarks of CD include granulo matous 
inflammat ion and aphthous ulcerat ion. CD is neither medically or surgi cally curable at the current 
time. 
Untreated CD patients commonly develop structural co mplications that include stricture and 
fistul a formation, which commo nly result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_754773]. When 
examining 306 CD patients from the [LOCATION_002], Thia et al. showed that the cumulat ive risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_754774] 33.7% at 5 years and 
50.8% at 20 years after establishment of CD diagnosis [2 ]. The natural course of the disease can 
range fro m an indolent course with prolonged periods of remission to aggressive, incapacitat ing 
disease associated with structural bowel wall damage. Certain patients have aggressive CD, which 
could be defined as having a high relapse rate, development of penetrating disease, need for repeat 
surgery , or m ultiple admissio ns for flares [3]. The pathophysio logy of IBD is complex as mult iple 
environmental factors interact with the genoty pe of an individual to cause expressio n of disease. 
Published risk factors for aggressive disease include involvement of the upper GI tract and ileum, 
penetrating disease, early age at diagnosis, smoking, extensive ulceration of the mucosa, high titers 
of certain serum ant ibodies, and m utations of  the nucl eotide-binding oligo merization 
domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) gene [4]. The abilit y to more readily predict which pat ients 
will be at higher risk for complicat ions and target more intensive, early  treatm ent to that group 
woul d be invaluable. The 2014 American Gastroenterology  Associ ation (AGA) Clinical Care 
Pathway  outlined cri teria for patients consi dered at m oderate -high risk for disease co mplications 
that included: <30 y ears of age at initial diagnosis, extensive anatomic involvement, perianal or 
severe rectal disease, deep ulcers, prior surgical resection or structuring, and/or penetrating 
behavior [5]. Addi tionally, the Crohn's Disease Personalized Risk and Outcome Prediction Tool 
(PROSPECT), which incorporates clinical, serological, and genet ic variables, has been developed 
by [CONTACT_754842]. This tool is used to predict the probabilit y of developi[INVESTIGATOR_754775], specifically  strictures or internal penetrating disease. The output of the predict ive model 
allows ri sk stratificat ion of pat ients from low to medi um to hi gh risk of co mplications wit hin a

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 0 4 30 June 2020
4.1.2 Vedolizumab
Vedolizumab (also called MLN0002) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclo nal 
antibody  (mAb) directed against the human lymphocyte integrin α4β7. The α4β7 integrin mediates 
lymphocy te trafficking to GI mucosa and gut- associated lymphoid t issue through adhesive 
interact ion with mucosal  addressin cell adhesion molecule- 1 (MAdCAM -1), whi ch is expressed 
on the endothelium o f mesenteric lymph nodes and GI mucosa [7-10]. Vedolizumab binds the 
α4β7 integrin, antagonizing its adherence to MAdCAM -1 and as such, impairs the migrat ion of gut 
homing lymphocytes into GI mucosa. As a result, vedo lizumab acts as a gut- selective 
immuno modulator [11]. 
Vedolizumab IV (also known as ENTYVIO; Vedolizumab for Inject ion, for Intravenous Use; 
Vedolizumab Powder for Concentrate for Solut ion for Infusio n; or MLN0002 IV) has been 
granted market ing approval in mult iple countries glo bally. Vedolizumab intravenous (IV) is 
approved for the treatment of adult pat ients with moderately to severely acute UC or CD who have 
had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to a tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) blocker or immuno modulator; or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or 
demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids. The approved dosing and administration regimen is 
300 m g vedolizumab IV infus ed intravenously  at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, then once every  8 weeks 
(Q8W) thereafter. 
Previously  conducted clinical  studi es have characterized the efficacy, safety , tolerabili ty, 
pharmacokinet ic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and immunogenicit y of vedo lizumab in healt hy 
subjects and subjects with UC or CD.
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted with vedo lizumab and its murine 
homolo gue, murine predecessor to vedolizumab antibody (Act -1). Act -1 has demonstrated clinica l 
and histom orphologic evidence of efficacy in an animal model of IBD (cotton- top tamarins). 
Extensive nonclinical evaluations of the cardiovascular, acute, local, subchronic, chronic, 
immuno logic, and reproductive toxicit y of vedo lizumab in pharmaco logically  responsiv e species 
(New Zealand white rabbit s and cyno molgus mo nkeys) have been conducted and support its 
clinical development. Nonclinical studi es also show that vedolizumab does not antagonize α4β1 
integrin [11].
[IP_ADDRESS] Human Experience

in efficacy co mpared to placebo for both the Induction Phase and Maintenance Phase. The study 
met its primary endpo int for the Induction Phase, clinica l remissi on at Week 6, but did not meet the 
second primary  endpoint of enhanced clinical response (Crohn’s Disease Activit y Index 
[CDAI] -100) at Week 6 in the overall population, although the treatment difference favored 
vedo lizumab. The study  did meet i tsprimary  endpoint for the Maintenance Phase, clinical 
remission at Week 52, as well as important secondary endpoints, including enhanced clinical 
response at Week 52 and corticosteroid -free clinical remissio n at Week 52 [12].
Rates of mucosal healing were recently reported in 27 CD subjects who received IV vedolizuma b 
monotherapy . Mucosal  healing was reported in 30% of subjects who had a baseline co lonoscopy  
before vedo lizumab, 73% of who m were not TNF -antagonist naïve. The subj ects’ second 
colonoscopy  occurred 12 to 52 weeks after vedolizumab induction (median of 22 weeks). Mucosal 
healing was defined as an absence of ulcerat ion. Endoscopic improvement was 52% [13].
Vedolizumab has shown an acceptable and consist ent safet y profile in clinical trials (see current

vedo lizumab were nausea, nasoph aryngi tis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_39738], arthralgia, py rexia, 
fatigue, headache, and cough. Most serious adverse events (SAEs) have been related to 
exacerbations or complications of the underlying UC or CD. For those infect ions that were 
reported more frequent ly in vedo lizumab -treated subjects, the sites of these infect ions correlated 
with the known tissue distribut ion of MAdCAM -[ADDRESS_1033273] ions 
(bronchit is, pneumonia, urinary tract infect ion, sepsis) occurred at low frequency (<1%). A total of 
4% of vedo lizumab -treated subj ects and 3% of placebo -treated subjects experienced an

Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_1033276] ivate lymphotoxin (TNF -β). TNF -α is a naturally occurring 
cytokine that i s invo lved in normal inflammatory  and immune responses. TNF -α plays an 
important role in both the path ologi c inflammat ion and the j oint destructi on that are hallmarks of 
inflammatory  diseases. Adalimumab also modulates bio logical responses that are induced or 
regul ated by  [CONTACT_51004] -α, including changes in the levels of adhesio n molecules responsible for 
leukocy te migrati on.
Adalimumab is approved globall y for the treatm ent of moderately to severely act ive CD in patients 
who have had an inadequate response to convent ional therapy . Additionally, adalimumab is 
approved for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing clinical remissio n in t hese pat ients if t hey 
have also lost response to or are intolerant to infliximab.

In CLASSIC I, a dose ranging, randomized, controlled induct ion trial of adalimumab, 299 subjects

demonstra ted that an adalimumab loading dose regimen of 160 mg subcutaneous (SC) at Week [ADDRESS_1033278] ive than placebo (36% vs 12%, p=0.001). 
CLASSIC II, a m aintenance follow -up tri al to CLASSIC I, dem onstrated that adalimumab SC 
every other week or weekly was superior to placebo in maintaining remissio n over a [ADDRESS_1033279] ion therapy . In thi s rerando mized cohort of 
55subjects, 79% who received adalimumab 40 mg every  other week and 83% who received 
40mg weekly maintained remission through Week 56 (primary endpo int) compared wit h 44% for 
placebo (p< 0.05 for both adalimumab groups vs placebo). The subje cts from CLASSIC I who had 
not been in remissio n ent ered an open -label ar m and received adalimumab 40 mg ever y other week

Vedolizumab IV
Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_1033285] acebo -controlled, rando mized, controlled trial evaluated 325 subjects with 
moderate to severe CD who had failed infliximab therapy (defined as intolerant of infliximab or 
having previously  responded then l ost response to infliximab). Subjects were treated with 
adalimumab (160 mg at Week 0 then 80 mg at Week 2) or placebo. A total of 301 subjects 
completed the tr ial, and at Week 4 induction of remission was greater for adalimumab than for 
placebo (21% vs 7% p<0.001) [18].
Adalimumab was well tolerated in the efficacy- based studi es discussed above. SAEs have been 
reported in 25% of patients, including inj ection-site reacti ons (20%), m alignant neoplasm (1.7%), 
opportunist ic infect ion (2.1%), and tuberculosis ([TB] 0.2%). Other adverse events (AEs) 
associ ated wi th adalimumab include increased risk of infections, ant ibody  formati on, 
autoimmunit y, skin eruptio n, abnorm al liver funct ion tests (LFTs), demyelizat ion, and congest ive

methotrexate has beco me the agent of cho ice for combinat ion therap y with the newer bio logics in 
rheumatoi d arthri tis [19], [20], [21], [22].
TNF antagonist therapy  and m ethotrexate appear to have addit ive effects with respect to efficacy 
in rheumatoid arthrit is. In CD, the additive effect ma y be relevant fro m a mechanist ic perspect ive 
since both drugs induce apoptosis. Cell death mechanisms and apoptosis are important to the 
pathogenesis of CD.
Following oral  administrati on of  low-dose methotrexate (<5 mg), absorption approaches 100%. 
The pea k blood concentration is observed wit hin 1 to2 hours. Methotrexate is 50% protein bound, 
displacement occurs in compet ition with other hi ghly protein -bound compounds, and distribut ion 
is widespread. In 1987, Kozarek was the first to report the results of intramuscular methotrexate 
therapy  in pat ients with refractory  IBD (14 CD; 7 UC) and two -thirds of patients with steroid 
refractory  disease showed an improvement in symptoms and a concomitant reduction in

these studies, steroid-dependent CD pati ents treated with 25 mg methotrexate intramuscularly 
each week achieved steroid -free remission rates in 39% compared with 19% on placebo, and 
maintained remis sion with 15mg methotrexate per week in 65% compared with 39% on placebo. 
In spi[INVESTIGATOR_754781], it has never been widely ut ilized as 
a monotherapy in adults but is increasingly used clinically in co mbinat ion wit h bio logic therapy  to 
reduce immunogenicit y [24]. The co mbinat ion of maintenance methotrexate and infliximab in the 
COMMIT tri al is the m ost recent study  to dem onstr ate immunogenicit y efficacy  of methotrexate 
on infliximab trough and ant i-infliximab ant ibody  levels [27]. The study did not, however, reveal a 
difference in clinical outcomes between combinat ion methotrexate/infliximab and infliximab 
monotherapy , despi[INVESTIGATOR_754782]. These results are in contrast to the results of the study  of bi ologic and 
immuno modulatory -naive patients in the SONIC CD study , which demonstrated an increased 
effect iveness of azathioprine/infliximab combinat ion therapy co mpared with infliximab 
monothera py in inducing and maintaining remission, and was corroborated by [CONTACT_754844] l evels and lower ant i-infliximab antibodies [28].
The m ost frequently observed adverse event of methotrexate therapy  is nausea (in up to 25% of 
treated patients), which often can be well -controlled and/or avoided with conco mitant ondansetron 
tablets given 1 to2 hours before and 12 to 24 hours after methotrexate administration [24]. 
Methotrexate also may cause bone marrow suppression. In 1 series, mild leukopenia (white blood 
cell [WBC] count 2.8 -4.0×109/L) was encountered at least once in 21% of patients wi th 
rheumatoi d arthri tis treated wi th 15 m g weekly [29]. In all cases, leukopenia was transient, 
responded to minimal dose reduction, and did not lead to cessat ion of therapy . Although severe 
leukopenia and associated infect ion has been reported with methotrexate, it is rare with low- dose
therapy . Leukopenia is usually  correctabl e by [CONTACT_754845]. 
Thrombocy topeni a is rarely seen. Addit ionally , acute pulmo nary toxicity is an unco mmo n adverse 
reacti on to m ethotrexate. This hypersensit ivity reacti on present s with acute dyspnea associated 
with bilateral  alveol ar or intersti tial pulm onary changes. A high clinical index of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n and 
prom pt treatment wi th steroi ds usually  leads to resol ution without chroni c sequelae. No increased 
incidence of cancer or lymph oma has been reported for methotrexate although overall rates of use 
are lower than that of other immunomodulator therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [24]. Methotrexate may pro mote rise of 
liver enzymes, which is observed in 3% to 33% of IBD patients treated with methotrexate, and 
necessitates discont inuing therapy in around 6% to 8% [24]. Recommendat ions for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_754783]. Underlying liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty  liver 
disease, diabetes, or excess alcoho l consumpt ion are imp ortant cofactors for methotrexate -induced 
liver toxicit y. However, methotrexate -associated advanced liver fibrosis is rarely seen in pat ients 
with IBD or rheum atoid arthri tis. Other GI com plaints including stomat itis and diarrhea are less

Vedolizumab IV
Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_1033290] infliximab and immuno modulator azathi oprine further 
significant ly improved treatment efficacy  [30]. About 40% of pati ents, however, will not achieve 
remis sion after ini tiation of  a combined TNF antagonist and immuno modulator [30]. This raises 
the question as to whether we can improve remission rates and modify disease progression by 
[CONTACT_1583] a third agent, vedolizumab, with a different mechanism o f action to TNF antagonists, to the 
combinat ion regimen, particularly  for pati ents who are at higher risk for CD complicat ions. 
Vedolizumab is an α4β7 anti-integrin, approved in the [LOCATION_002] in 2014 to treat both moderate 
to severe CD and UC and in Canada in 2015 to treat UC, after demo nstrating efficacy and safet y in 
the GEMINI studies [12,31,32] . Subjects who have failed TNF -antagonist therapy  have been 
shown to have higher levels of tissue MAdCAM and lower levels of circulat ing α4β7 -positive cells. 
Subjects who responded to therapy  with infliximab or adalimumab have been shown to have a 
decrease in MAdCAM and an increase in α4β7 -positive cells [33]. Thi s suggests that the 
vedo lizumab pathway is act ive and that vedolizumab may wo rk well as part of a combinat ion 
therapy  regimen. Combining bio logic therapi [INVESTIGATOR_754785] m echanisms of act ion, such as the 
anti-integrin vedo lizumab and the TNF antagonist adalimumab, may provide clinically relevant 
synergy .
There i s growing evidence that mucosal  healing is an important outcome in CD treatment. 
Rutgeerts et al. demonstrated this in the postoperative setting showing that CD patients with 
endoscopi c evi dence of act ive disease were more likely to have a clinical recurrence in the 
following 4 to 8 y ears [34]. In clinical trials wit h bio logics, pati ents who have mucosal healing 
have been shown to have increased rates of steroid -free remissio n and a decreased risk of surgery  
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298] [35]. In view of these findings, clinical practice is moving toward a “treat to 
target” approach, where the goals o f treatm ent go bey ond controlling symptom s and instead aim 
for improving object ive measures such as mucosal healing and deep remissio n [36].
Further subgroup analyses in CD bio logic clinic al trials have demonstrated higher response rates 
in patients who are treated earlier in the course of their disease (less than 1 or 2 y ears fro m 
diagnosis). In a recent study , using a combinat ion of a TNF antagonist, infliximab, and 
azathioprine, clinical remissio n and full mucosal healing was observed in more than 65% of 
patients wi th early disease of less than 18 months in duration [37,38] . The REACT trial 
demonstrated that early introduction of co mbinat ion therapy  with adalimumab and an 
immuno modulator decreased the chance o f hospi [INVESTIGATOR_36651], com plicati ons, and surgeries at 
2years compared to convent ional therapy [39]. 
Importantly, our understanding o f which pat ients with CD are at hi gher risk for an aggressive 
disease course has improved, as various risk factors are identifi ed and predi ctive tools have been 
developed [6,40]. Invo lvement of the upper GI tract and ileum, penetrating dise ase, early  age at 
diagnosis, sm oking, extensive ulceration of the mucosa, high titers of serum antibodies, and 
mutati ons of the NOD2 gene all have been determined to be markers of aggressive CD [3].This can 
allow for targeting of earlier co mbinat ion therapy  forthose at hi ghest risk. 
The hypothesis of this study  is that triple combinati on therapy  with 2biologics wi th different 
mechanisms of action (the anti- integrin vedo lizumab IV and the TNF antagonist adalimumab SC) Property of [COMPANY_005]: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useents, however, will not achieve

profile at inducing endoscopic remissio n over a 26 -week period. Endoscopic remission will be 
defined as a Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES -CD) 0to 2. Only  subjects wi th 
suspected aggressive CD at increased risk for disease complicat ions will be enro lled in the study . 
By [CONTACT_754848], subjects will be assessed as having CD at moderate-high risk for 
complicat ions based on clinical assessment, the PROSPECT tool, or criteria defined by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1033291]  [4-6]. Importantly , the tri ple combinati on approach is 
hypoth esized to m odify disease progression in newly  diagnosed CD subjects at hi gher risk for 
complicat ions related to more aggressive disease.

and trials. The Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severit y(CDEIS) and the SES -CD are robust, 
validated, endoscopic indices that show high reproducibilit y among central  readers [41]. The 
absence of validated score thresho lds associated wit h specific prognostic values or with 
endosc opic healing, however, represents a weakness of both the CDEIS and the SES- CD. While 
most thresho lds for remissio n in trials have been chosen arbitrarily by [CONTACT_431], specialists in 
the field of IBD recently agreed on a SES- CD of 0 –2 for the definit ion of endoscopi c remissio n. 
Endoscopic response as a >50% decrease in SES-CD was also proposed [41].
There are different treatment agents and combinat ions used currently in clinical pract ice to achieve 
the goal  of endoscopi [INVESTIGATOR_754787] n. Combinat ion therapy  for CD appears to l ead to 
significant ly improved efficacy; however, many subjects treated with combined TNF- antagoni st 
and immuno modulator therapy  do not achi eve mucosal  healing [30]. Vedolizumab has a unique, 
gut-select ive, immunomodul atory  mechanism  of action that provides the basis for its development 
as a treatm ent for CD. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] [ADDRESS_1033309] ion and m aintenance therapy  in subjects with CD [12]. The goal of adding vedo lizumab, 
which has a different mechanism of act ion, to a TNF antagonist and immuno modulator, is to safely 
and effectively improve remission rates in CD patients. Coadministration of the 2 biologics 
infliximab and natalizumab was previous ly studi ed for 10 weeks in 52 CD subjects and was well 
tolerated wi thout increased adverse events compared to infliximab mo notherapy  [42].
The primary  endpoint evaluated in this study  will be endo scopic remission at Week 26. Based on 
a post hoc analysis of the SONIC trial, 26 weeks is the minimum t ime for the m ajority of patients 
to achieve deep remissio n wit h combinat ion therapy [43]. CD patients treated early in their course 
of disease wi th combinat ion therapy  have reduced chances of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], com plicat ions, and 
surgeri es [39]. 
Our understanding o f which pat ients with CD are at hi gher risk for aggressive disease course has 
improved. A number of clinical factors have been ident ified that predict CD progression including 
disease l ocati on, y oung age at di agnosis, di sease behavior, peri anal disease, use of steroi ds at 
diagnosis, and smoking. Some serological tests, such as ant ibodies against Saccaromyces 
cerevisae and genet ic markers, have also been used in an effort to improve risk stratificat ion. In 
2014, th e AGA published CD Clinical Care Pathway, which includes pat ient stratificat ion 
according to their disease burden ( Appendix E) [5]. Using this care pathway , pati ents are 
considered being at moderate -high r isk for CD complicat ions due to disease progression if they are 
<[ADDRESS_1033310] perianal and/or 
severe rectal diseas e, have deep ulcers, or have had prior surgical resect ion and structuring and/or 
penetrating behavior. Siegel et al. created a web-based tool, the PROSPECT CD Risk Calculator, 
which has been used to predict outcomes and response to treatment for individual s [4,6]. This tool 
has been validated in pediatric and adult patients with CD. About 20% of patients with CD have an 
indolent course of disease from the time o f diagnosis and are considered low risk for disease 
complicat ions. Only subjects with suspected aggressive CD at increased risk for disease 
complicat ions will be enrolled in the stu dy.Property of [COMPANY_005]: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Userobust,

[IP_ADDRESS] PROSPECT CD Tool 
The PROSPECT CD Risk Calculator is a web -based tool used to predict out comes and response to 
treatm ent [4,6]. For subjects who m the invest igator chooses to implement the PROSPECT tool, 
their blood will be drawn at the time of informed consent and shipped to Prometheus Labs, San 
Diego, CA (or other lab) for serologic and genet ic markers. If an invest igator chooses not to utilize 
the PROSPECT tool to assess a subject’s risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_754796], blood may still be 
collected for serologic and genet ic markers for the endpo int analysis o f PROSPECT tool 
perform ance at any  time during the subject’s screening period. Further instruction on the 
collect ion and handling of these samples can be found in the study Laboratory Manual. The results 
of these tests will be used as inputs to the PROSPECT predict ive tool. This mathemat ical 
predi ction tool incorporates basic disease characterist ics including disease locat ion and t ime since 
diagnosis, in addit ion to serologic markers such as ant i-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody  
(ASCA), CBir, perinuclear antineutrophil antibody (pANCA), and a single genet ic polymorphism

9.1.11 Colonoscopy and Biopsy Procedure
Colonoscopy  will be performed during screening and at Weeks 26 and 102 or early terminat ion. 
All study  colonoscopi [INVESTIGATOR_754799] -recorded using the Robarts Central Image Management 
Solution (CIMS). All study endoscopy videos will be subject to central re view to ensure consistent 
grading. A central reviewer will confirm the SES- CD inclusio n criterion pri or to subj ect 
enrollment. Central reviewer’s grading will stand as final assessment for eligibilit y. CIMS will 
communicate incidental findings observed dur ing central review to the invest igator/study  team for 
additional follow up.
At each colonoscopy , up to 4 biopsies for histopatho logy will be collected from 5 segments (for a 
total of up to 20 biopsies): the rectum, left colon, transverse co lon, right colo n, and ileum. Biopsies 
will be taken in the vicinit y of the m ost prominent ul cerat ive lesio ns, if present. If there is more 
than [ADDRESS_1033376] preparati on for colonoscopy  shoul d follow the si te’s 
usual clinical practice (such as polyethylene glycol). 
All biopsies collected per protocol will be centrally  stored and analyzed at the end of the study . 
Although it i s permissible for the investigator to take addit ional biopsy samples as deemed 
necessary  for standard of care management of the patient during the protocol -requi red 
colonoscopy , these will be considered as occurring outside the protocol. Such collect ion, handling,

9.1.12 Primary Efficacy Measurement
The primary  efficacy  measure is the percentage of su bjects who achieve endoscopic remissio n, 
defined as SES-CD 0- 2 at Week 26.
9.1.13 The SES- CD
The SES -CD [48] evaluates 4 endoscopic variables (u lcer size, proportion of the surface area that 
is ulcerated, proportion of the surface area affected, and stenosis) by [CONTACT_754886] a 
scale fro m 0 to 3 where higher scores indicate more severe diseas e, in 5 bowel  segments (ileum, 
right colon, t ransverse colon, left colon, and rectum). 
The score for each endoscopic variable is the sum of the values obtained for each segment. The 
SES-CD Total is the sum o f the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56. See Appendix F.
9.1.14 CDAI
A CDAI [49] score will be calculated at baseline Week 0, using subject diary entries during 
screening within [ADDRESS_1033377] recent 7 days wit h complete

prior, day  of, and the day  after the col onoscopy  cannot be used for CDAI sub -score cal culat ion. 
For the baseline CDAI the hematoc rit resul ts collected during screening should be used. A CDAI 
score will also be derived at the time po ints specified in the Schedule of Events and at any 
unscheduled visit(s) due to disease exacerbat ion. See Appendix G. A Standard Weight Table is

DNA form s the basis for the genes that make the body  produce proteins such as enzymes, drug 
transporters, or drug targets. RNA has mult iple vital roles in the codes, decoding, regulat ion, 
expressio n of genes and sensing and co mmunicat ing responses to cellular signals. Both DNA and 
RNA from t issues such as blood may be evaluated for the genet ic contribut ion of how the drug is 
broken down, or how the drug affects the body . This is called a “Pharmacogeno mics research 
study .” Specific purposes of this study  include:
Identifying genet ic reasons why certain people respond differently to vedolizumab.
Finding out more informat ion about how vedolizumab works. 
Generat ing informat ion needed for res earch, development, and regulatory  approval  of tests to 
predi ct response to vedolizumab.
Ident ifying variations in genes related to the bio logical target of vedo lizumab.
This information may be used, for example, to develop a better understanding of the sa fety and 
efficacy  of vedo lizumab and other study medicat ions, and for improving the efficiency, design and 
study  methods of future research studies.

Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms sh ould NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If a di agnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG paramete rs are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if the y 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  retest and/or continued monitori ng of an abnormal value are not considered an 
intervent ion. In addit ion, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG finding s are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the ti me o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, l aboratory tests, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless 
related to study procedures. Howe ver, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication 
of such a concurrent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medicat ion) or 
an AE (worsening or c omplicat ion occurs after start of study medicat ion). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If a subject has a pre- exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_45285], serious or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complic ation should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).Property of [COMPANY_005]: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usempanying signs (including

If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs /Seri ous PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
informed consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
perform ed early  (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the 
worsening of the condit ion should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complicat ions 
resulting fro m any planned surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion

10.1.7 Severity of PTEs and AEs
Thedifferent categories o f intensit y (severit y) are characterized as follows:
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The eve nt causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.
10.1.8 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categories:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.
10.1.9 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Relate d if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related. 
10.1.10 Start Date
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or physician, and the time, if available.
10.1.11 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died, and the time, if available.
10.1.12 Frequency 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c AEs/PTE (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.13 Action Concerning Study Medication 
Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the pa rticular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.

stopped before the onset of the AE).
Dose Interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.1.14 Outcome
Recovered/Resolved – Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the norm al range or to Baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/reso lving.”
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosis, signs/symptoms or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved.”
Reso lved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal  –the AEs/PTEs which are con sidered as the cause of death. 
Unknown –the course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1670]’s participation in the study .

[IP_ADDRESS] PTE and AE ReportingAt each study  visit, the inv estigator will assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ng at any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to Baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study procedure, need not to be fo llowed up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study medicat ion 
or not, m ust be m onitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically  relevant changes in 
laborator y values have returned to baseline or until there is a sat isfactory  explanat ion for the 
changes observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, 
whether or not the invest igator concludes that the event is related to the drug tr eatment. The

CDAI and qualit y of life instruments will not be used as a primary means to collect AEs. However, 
shoul d the invest igator become aware of a potential AE through the informat ion collected with 
these instruments, proper follow -up with the subject for medi cal eval uation shoul d be undertaken. 
Through this fo llow-up if it is determined that an AE not previously  reported has been i dentified, 
norm al reporting requi rements shoul d be applied.

No data safet y monitoring co mmittee will be used in this study.

A PML Independent Adjudication Co mmittee (IAC) will be inst ituted for this s tudy. The PML 
IAC will consist of a panel of leading PML experts, including a neuro logist, neuroradio logist, and 
a viro logist.
11.1.1 Risk Assessment and Minimization for PML (RAMP) Program
Natalizumab (TYSABRI), another integrin receptor antagonist, has been ass ociated wi thPML, a 
rare and often fatal opportunist ic infection o f the central  nervous system. PML is caused by  [CONTACT_39809] (JCV) and typi[INVESTIGATOR_754804] 
[58,59] . Natalizumab is a pan - α4 integrin antagonist that binds to both the α4β1 and α4β7 
integrins and inhibits cellular adhesio n to vascular cell adhesio n molecule -1 (VCAM -1) and 
MAdCAM -1 [60,61] . In contrast, vedolizumab binds to the α4β7 i ntegrin only [11]and inhibits 
adhesio n to MAdCAM -1, but not VCAM -1. Arisk of PML cannot be ruled out with vedo lizumab .
To address the theoretical risk o f the deve lopment of PML in subjects treated with vedo lizumab, 
the sponsor, with input fro m renowned PML experts, has developed a RAMP program. The 
complete descri ption of the RAMP program, including materials and instructions for its 
implementation and mo nitoring, is included in the Reference Binder.
The RAMP is focused on early  clinical detecti on and management of that specific safet y risk, 
including the discont inuat ion of study  drug, if applicable. Subjects are assessed for signs and Property of [COMPANY_005]: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of UseThe timelines

To ensure success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the features of 
PML, and subjects will be trained to report specific neurological signs and symptoms without 
delay. Educati onal materi als for teaching site personnel and subjects about PML and the RAMP 
procedures will be distributed to all sites and are included in the Reference Binder. Formal teaching and training will be performed for site personnel prior to the start of the study . Subjects 
will receive training and educat ional materi als pri or to receiving treatm ent. The informed consent

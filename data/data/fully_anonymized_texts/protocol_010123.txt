Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM) in Primary Brain Tumor Patients  
SIGNIFICANCE  
Brain cancer is associated with disproportionate  financial impact, symptom burden , and functional 
impairment . Brain cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in young adults  and the eighth -most 
common among those age [ADDRESS_170042] the p revalence rate for PBT in the United  States  (US) 
at 0.21% of the population (more than 700,000 affected individuals), with an additional 87,[ADDRESS_170043] (mean net cost 
approaching $150,000) and the highest per -patient last -year-of-life care cost (mean net cost ranging from 
$135,000 to $210,000) relative to other cancers.3 Further, the symptoms associated with brain cancer are 
numerous and include  fatigue, sleep disturbance, headache, nausea, seizure, cognitive changes, and neurologic 
symptoms , such as dizziness, difficulty with balance, sensory problems, and numbness/tingling.[ADDRESS_170044] majority require some form of 
rehabilitation therapy.5 Compared to other cancer populations, individuals with brain cance r are less likely to be 
employed6,7 and more likely to be divorced .8 Activities of daily living that promote independence , such as self -
care, locomotion/mobility, and driving can be affected by [CONTACT_47827], treatment, or both.9,[ADDRESS_170045] common type of m alignant PBT, has a median overall survival rate of 15 
months and a five -year survival rate of 6.8%.2 It is estimated that over 18,000 people with a malignant PBT will 
die each year. Furthermore, medical interventions targeting amelioration of  PBT are associated with a range of 
adverse effects , including cognitive decline  and fatigue , compounding the symptoms of the disease itself . Given 
this poor prognosis, medical management often focuses on symptom alleviation (e.g., the provision of steroids to 
reduce brain swelling , anticonvulsants to reduce seizure frequency ).[ADDRESS_170046]  include a  focus on improving quality of life and reducing 
psychological burden. Nearly all patients with PBT (93% -95%) report symptoms of depression,14,15 with rates of 
clinical diagnoses greater than both other oncology populations and the general population (22% -41% v. 13% v. 
7%, respectively).15–20 Our own preliminary data demonstrate that those with PBT endorse a particular type of 
distress —death anxiety —at a drastically higher rate than other cancer populations (81% v. 32%).21 Death anxiety 
refers to fear and preoccupation with thoughts of death and dying that may interfere with individuals’ daily 
functioning. Anxiety regarding death is understandable among those with brain cancer given the uncertain disease 
trajectory, lack of curative treatment, potential loss of functioning, and the inherent existential nature of brain 
cancer itself.22 Distress of this kind in individuals  with advanced cancer has been shown to be ameliorated by 
[CONTACT_148314].23  
Individuals with brain cancer are significantly underrepresented —and often purposely excluded —from 
behavioral and psychosocial invest igations. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_148303] , 
little is known about  the trajectory  of this distress, its correlates, or effective treatment s. Our research team 
recently conducted a systematic review of the  extent to which individuals  with brain cancer are included in 
psycho -oncology research focused on death -related distress . Results revealed that this patient population 
represented only 0.18% of participants inc luded in such studies.24 Frequently , this omission is not due to oversight, 
but rather is purposeful and based on the unsubstantiated assumption that individuals with brain cancer are not 
cognitively capable of participating in such research. While those individuals with PBT  are at risk for cognitive 
decline, only a small sub -sample demonstrate cognitive impairment to an extent that woul d exclude them from 
research studies. In our own research using a common cognitive screener , the Mini Mental State Exam  (MMSE ), 
we found that the majority  (66%)  of patients with PBT passed this eligibility screen er, with 25% perform ing in 
the range indicative of mild neurocognitive disorder  (mNCD)  and only 9% perform ing in the range reflective of 
dementia.25 In short, t he need  for inclusion of those with PBT in research is clear, and their exclusion from 
behavioral and psychosocial research represents a significant gap in knowledge. The capacity of the se individuals 
to consent and to engage in s tudy tasks is nuanced, highlight ing the urgent need for research designed and 
conducted by [CONTACT_1697] s familiar with this vulnerable population and its unique challenges and 
considerations .26   
 
An effective evidence -based treatment to address psychological 
distress in advanced cancer exists —but has never been 
investigated in brain cancer. Though cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) is effective for a variety of psycho -oncology concerns, it is less 
effective for  individuals with advanced cancer.27–29 Indeed, a recent 
large -scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) found CBT to be 
ineffective for treating symptoms of depression in patients with 
advanced cancer.30 Similarly, psychopharmacological approaches are 
of limited benefit for this population, and are often contraindicated for 
individuals with PBT. Research further demonstrates that 
antidepressant use is associated with lowered seizure thresholds, 
cognitive decline, and worsened fatigue among individuals with 
PBT;31 and, the use of antidepressants has been shown to be an 
independent predictor of tumor recurrence in  this population.32 An 
alternative intervention, Managing Cancer and Living M eaningfully (CALM), was designed to specifically 
address the inevitable challenges patients with advanced cancer face  (Figure 1 ). CALM is a brief, indi vidual, 
manual ized, supportive -expressive psychotherapeutic intervention developed by [CONTACT_148315] -oncology and 
palliative care .23,33,[ADDRESS_170047] decade has shown CALM to be feasible and ac -
ceptable,35–[ADDRESS_170048] been 
excluded from CALM trials .  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
AIM s: To conduct a mixed -method Phase IIa  Proof -of-Concept Trial  (N = 12) with post -session surveys and 
individual exit interviews to guide CALM adaptation  and determine preliminary feasibility and acceptability in 
patients with PBT .  
Exploratory AIMs .  
1. To examine within -group changes in depression, distress about deat h and dying, and quality of life  in 
order to assess preliminary efficacy in this population.  
 
HYPOTHESES  
We hypothesize that it will be feasible to recruit participants into a controlled trial, to evaluate and follow study 
participants and to preliminarily assess the efficacy of CALM in individuals with brain cancer.  Preliminary 
information on CALM feasibility will be collected with regards to the ability to consent patients to the study , 
study session attendance, post -session assessment  and follow -up assessment completion, and participant 
satisfaction ratings.    
 
RESEARCH STRATEGY AND FEASIBILITY  
Approach.  A mixed -methods approach, utilizing the NIH Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) supported 
ORBIT model43,44 has been chosen for this study. The ORBIT model begins with a theory grounded in behavioral 
science about the mechanisms of behavior change (Phase I), and develops an intervention in small incremental 
steps, paying attention to tailoring, acceptability, a nd testing efficacy of early outcomes using smaller experiments 
(Phase II), before embarking on a randomized controlled trial (Phase III).  
 
Study Population. Diagnosis and classification of brain cancer will be based on [ADDRESS_170049] are 
White  (76%) followed by [CONTACT_148316] (16%) and most are men (59%). The majority fall into the younger 
age range (5 9%; 18 -54 years).  
 
Inclusion Criteria. This study will consider for enrollment individuals of all genders, ethnic, racial, and 
socioeconomic b ackgrounds. PBT p articipants must: (1) have a confirmed malignant brain cancer diagnosis via 
histopathology, (2) be a minimum of [ADDRESS_170050] -surgical resection or biopsy (if applicable), (3) be primarily 
English speaking, (4) be age 18+, (5) obtain >20 on Telephone  Inter view for C ognitive Status , (6) have current 
elevated depression ( Patient Health Questionnaire -9 Item [ PHQ9 ] >10) or death anxiety symptoms (D eath and 
Dying Distress Scale [DADDS]  >15),23 and (6) have rel iable internet connection.   
  
Exclusion Criteria.  This study will exclude participa nts with : (1) Major communication difficulties as 
determined by [CONTACT_148317], (2) inability to meet with 
interventionist via an electronic device for telehealth intervention sessions, or (3) inability to provide informed 
consent.  
 
VCU Recruitment.  VCUHealth treat s approximately  [ADDRESS_170051] the study described to them. Interested individuals will be emailed 
and asked to read the consent for m and encouraged to ask any questions. They will be informed that their decision 
to (or not) participate will not affect their care at any VCU facility. Once all questions are answered, interested 
individuals will be asked to sign the consent form  electron ically . We anticipate participation rates similar to those 
reported in prior advanced cancer behavioral health and psychotherapeutic trials, with >70% consenting to 
screening and >30% of eligible patients enrolling ( Table 1).23,35,36,40,41   
 
Scientific Rigor.  To parallel the multi -phase drug development scientific process, including intervention 
development and dose -response testing (Phase I), feasibility and acceptability evaluations (Phase II), and eventual 
Phase III efficacy trails, the NIH SOBC ORBIT model  was selected to guide this project (Figure 5).[ADDRESS_170052] and unbiased approach, we will: (1) use validated measures ( Table 2), (2) have a non -clinical research 
assistant (RA) conduct eligibility screening and consent to reduce coercion, and (3) have the RA collect 
participant measures and conduct exit interviews .   
 
AIM 1: Proof -of-Concept Trial Design.  Using the ORBIT model, we will initially conduct a 1 -year Phase IIa 
Proof -of-Concept Trial  (N=12) to guide CALM implementation for individuals with PBT. Within one week 
before and after the intervention and [ADDRESS_170053] -intervention (if applicable given terminal illness ; Figure 6), 
participants will be asked to complete self -report surveys of behavioral and  psychological variables ( Table 2) via 
a secure online data collection system (REDCap). Participants will be offered a $[ADDRESS_170054] for completing these 
surveys across each of the 3 timepoints (pre -intervention, post -intervention, follow -up). If paper cop ies of the 
questionnaire are preferred by [CONTACT_2299], these can be mailed and the RA will input any data into REDCap 
upon return. Six sessions of CALM therapy will be provided at no cost to participants. After each intervention 
session, participants will be sent a link for a brief post -session satisfaction survey via secure email link. 
Participants will rate 1) topic applicability ; 2) perceived benefit of session ; 3) comfort with interventionist(s); and 
4) overall satisfaction. Participants who withdraw will be contact[CONTACT_148318] -ended questions on reasons 
for termination and suggestions for improvement. Interventionists will also complete surveys at the end of each 
session which address : 1) topic applicability;  2) perceived participant response; 3) suggestions for improvement.  
Within one month of intervention completion, the RA will conduct individual exit interviews by [CONTACT_648]  (Figure 
8), which will be audio recorded for verbatim transcription. Interviews will assess length and number of sessions, 
content  applicability , recommended modifications, helpful and unhelpful aspects of sessions, perceived benefits, 
overall satisfaction, and sugg estions for improvement. This will inform treatment preferences, intervention 
adaptations, and overall satisfaction. Our team has used these survey and interview measures with success in prior 
treatment development trials .49,50At any time during the intervention, participants considered by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_148304], or who demonstrate significant worsening of depression or other psychiatric co -
morbidities that require treatment, will be referred for psychiatric assessment and treatment in the  Department of 
Psychiatry. This may include pharmacotherapy or other psychiatric interventions.  
 
 
CALM Interventionist s. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_148305] (2018: 
Toronto; 2019: London and Banff; 2020: Virginia). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_148306] s ongoing supervision 
from CALM founder  on a bi -weekly basis to discuss cases, therapeutic f idelity, supervision of interventionists, 
and research procedures. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_148307] -
doctoral and doctoral trainees. All interventionists will also have attended at least one 3 -day CALM trainin g 
workshop  and participate in ongoing weekly supervision .   
 
Assessment Measures.   
Covariates.  Baseline self -report data will include: age, gender, ethnicity, race, educational status, employment, 
marital and parental status, history of substance abuse and/or mental health history (psychiatric diagnoses, suicidal 
ideat ion), and self -reported social support and spi[INVESTIGATOR_148308] . We will extract the following data from medical 
records : time since diagnosis, tumor characteristics and treatment, seizure history, and psychopharmacological 
medication history. Patients ’ oncologists will report on estimated prognosis.  Additional psychological 
interventi on (e.g., psychotherapy, pastoral care, social work) and/or psychopharmacological medication use will 
also be tracked throughout the intervention and follow -up time period.

DATA ANALYSIS.  
Primary Outcomes.  Detailed records of the number of individuals who screen, are eligible, enroll, complete 
assessment measures, and attend telehealth sessions will be kept. Reasons for attrition will be recorded. 
Individuals who “no -show” will be contact[CONTACT_148319]. 
Each attempt to contact [CONTACT_148320]. This information will guide future recruitment/retention 
and inform feasibility. Recruitment source will be tracked to determine the most fruitful strategies.  We will 
calculate frequencies and proportions to explore preliminary  feasibility outcomes  and means and standard 
deviations or medians and interquartile ranges to assess preliminary acceptability ( Table 1). The two -sample t -
tests and/or Mann -Whitney U -test, and chi-square  tests will be used to compare eligible patients who did and did 
not enroll in terms of demographic , medical, and psychiatric variables.   
 
Exploratory Outcomes.  Within -group changes i n behavioral and psychological variables will be explored to 
prepare for future pi[INVESTIGATOR_148309]. Thus, for each data collection time points we will calculate the mean 
and standard deviation of exploratory outcomes . In addition, we will calculate the correlation on the measures 
between time points as well as calculating the dif ference scores and the accompanying standard deviations . 
 
POTENTIAL CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS  
Our previous track record of research accomplishments clearly demonstrates  our capacity to conduct  the proposed 
research. The proposed qualitative methods will ensure that intervention components are appropriately adapted 
and aligned with patient preferences  and capabilities . If enrollment is less than expected, recruitment will  be 
expanded to greater Richmond community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148310] a  long-standing collaborative 
relationship  with. If eligibility rates are less than expected,  we will consider enrolling individuals with high -risk 
grade II PBT. If interventi on adherence is low, we will aim to align appointments with neuro -oncology clinic 
days and provide the option for in -person CALM sessions  for those unable or unwilling to participate in an online 
intervention . Attrition due to disease progression is a conc ern. If necessary, additional participants will be 
recruited. All visits are being scheduled and completed using a telehealth format as to negate in -person safety 
issues with COVID -19. If telehealth is not an option for a n individual,  we can consider in-person clinic visit s 
following all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines .

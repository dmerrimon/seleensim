primary objective is observe the safety and tolerability of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]®.  Secondary objectives will be to 
document the relative pain during the Sono HSG procedure and any changes in quality of life as a result 
of the procedure according to the contrast agent.  Exploratory outcomes will be the feasibility of 
blinding the patient and observer to the type of contrast medium injected at the end of the Sono HSG 
procedure and the prevalence of Anti-Chlamydial antibodies and association with outcomes.  The results 
from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_784779] a larger multi-center clinical trial examining Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]® as a 
contrast agent during Sono HSG.
1.2 Primary  Study Endpoints
Ongoing pregnancy rate  (8 week viable intrauterine pregnancy) on all pregnancies conceived within 6 
months(+2 weeks) of Sono HSG.
   
1.3 Secondary  Study Endpoints
Procedural related pain on visual  analogue scale (VAS) score, echogenicity of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]®  with 
ultrasound, accuracy of patient and investigator assessment of type of contrast medium received during 
the study, prevalence of anti-chlamydial antibodies, live birth rate.  
2.[ADDRESS_1079608] of debate dating into the 1950’s 
and before.   Oil based media have been theorized  to have greater benefit on facilitating pregnancy 
after the test (both spontaneously and after treatment) compared to water based agents.   There have 
been a number of randomized trials to support this and serial meta-analyses have documented a benefit 
of oil-based contrast media over water-based on pregnancy rates.(1-3)   The exact mechanisms for the 
improvement of fertility are unknown, but it is theorized that oil based method may better unclog 
blocked or obstructive fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_784780].   There may also be immune modulated 
effects that improve fertilization.   It has also been suggested that women with unexplained infertility 
may receive the greatest therapeutic benefit from the use of oil-based contrast agents. 
We plan  to study a specific oil based contrast medium,  Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]® (Guerbet LLC, Princeton, NJ).  This 
product is FDA approved for infusion during hysterosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_784781] U.S.  There have been a 
number of small published RCTs documenting a pregnancy benefit with this specific contrast agent vs 
water-based contrast(4,5) with long term follow up of safety and efficacy.(6)
The major  controversy about the use of oil-based contrast agents are concerns about the safety with 
reports of granuloma formation in the pelvis and concerns about intravasation of oil-based dye and 
related morbidity including at least one reported case of a coma which eventually resolved 
spontaneously.
STUDY00008466
Approval: 9/7/2021
Page 4 of  19 (V.04/27/2017) There are  multiple public health issues that could benefit from further study of oil-based agents.  We 
have seen an increasing utilization of in vitro fertilization in the U.S. and throughout the world.  The 
indications for IVF which were originally tubal disease, have now expanded to any infertility diagnosis, 
and we are seeing increasing utilization of this technology for ovulatory disorders and unexplained 
infertility which used to be managed with less expensive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].(7)  Additionally IVF in the U.S. is 
associated with a high risk of multiple pregnancy, currently approaching 30% because of the habit of 
transferring multiple embryos (up to [ADDRESS_1079609] patients).(8)  While the introduction of guidelines limiting 
the number of embryos transferred has lowered the high order multiple pregnancy rate (i.e. triplets or 
higher), this twinning rate has remained high. Twinning remains an undesirable treatment outcome due 
to   its associated increased risk of maternal and fetal morbidity (through increased maternal rates of 
pre-eclampsia, abnormal placentation, abruption, etc and through increased prematurity, either 
iatrogenic or spontaneous due to preterm delivery on the fetus).  Identifying a fertility test that also has 
therapeutic benefit, would increase the number of  pregnancies conceived naturally or with low cost, 
low multiple pregnancy-associated fertility treatments (i.e. mainly oral based ovarian stimulation agents 
for the female factor and intrauterine inseminations for male factor).   Reducing preterm delivery rates 
and fetal prematurity is the number one perinatal health issue in the [LOCATION_002].
Unrecognized tubal disease  remains a leading cause of infertility in the world.  Many have 
recommended using serum tests to document a history of pelvic infection and potential tubal disease.  
One of the tests that is used world-wide but remains experimental are tests for anti-chlamydial 
antibodies.  Chlamydia remains a common sexually transmitted disease and a major cause of pelvic 
inflammatory disease, tubal damage, and infertility.   We have previously shown that anti-chlamydial 
antibodies (specifically anti-Chlamydial trachomatis IgG3 seropositivity) is associated with lower 
pregnancy rates and higher rates of ectopic pregnancy in an infertile population undergoing first line 
infertility treatment with oral ovarian stimulation agents combined with either timed intercourse or 
intrauterine insemination.(9)  We are further interested in incorporating this test into the fertility testing 
regimen and it may also select patients who may be more likely to conceive after Sono HSG testing (i.e. 
by [CONTACT_662239]-chlamydial antibodies).
2.2 Previous Data
Recently a large  multi-center trial using this agent compared to a water-based agent was conducted in 
the Netherlands and the results were reported at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human 
Reproduction and Endocrinology (ESHRE) in 2015.   The trial (H2OIlie study) randomized 1119 women 
primarily with unexplained infertility in a 1:1 ratio to the agents and found a significantly higher ongoing 
pregnancy rate 6 mos after HSG (the primary outcome) with Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]®  compared to the water-based 
agent, i.e. 39.2% vs. 28.5%, Relative Risk (RR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs)   RR = 1.38, 95% CIs 
1.[ADDRESS_1079610] media, specifically Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784782]® both in the context of a contrast agent and as a potential treatment agent for women from couples 
with infertility.  We specifically propose, eventually, to both build on and replicate the H2Oilie trial 
conducted in the Netherlands.   We will build on the H2Oilie trial by [CONTACT_784796].   Ultrasound based hysterosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_2114], i.e. Sono HSG, can be 
conducted in an outpatient setting by a single physician.    It avoids patient and physician exposure to 
radiation, in many cases the additional trip to an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the requirement of staffing by [CONTACT_784797], and the greater expense of fluoroscopic HSG.   We will expand the 
patient population from primarily women with unexplained infertility, to all women with infertility who 
will receive expectant management or conventional first line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  We will excluded women who 
will be going on to in vitro fertilization (IVF) as the chosen infertility therapy, because IVF as a first line 
STUDY00008466
Approval: 9/7/2021
Page 5 of  19 (V.04/27/2017) therapy is  only applicable to women with tubal occlusion/tubal disease or couples with severe 
oligospermia  requiring oocyte insemination or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).   
Our specific hypothesis is that  tubal patency testing by [CONTACT_784798]-based contrast medium, 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]®,  will lead to higher ongoing pregnancy rates compared to the use of normal saline as a 
contrast medium with equal safety as a saline contrast agent.    
The intervention  will involve injection of 10 cc of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]® versus saline at the time of Sono HSG as a 
control.  Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]® is approved as an injection agent for HSG by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA. 
The underlying  rational for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_784783] a larger multi-center trial definitively powered to document the safety and efficacy of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784782]® as a primary contrast agent during Sono HSG.

4.3 Recruitment  materials
Phone Screening  Eligibility Form will be used to pre-screen interested subjects.
4.4 Eligibility/screening  of subjects
A screening  script will be designed and utilized to use in response to a potential subjects 
interest in the study. This will include a script to follow as well as a list of general 
inclusion/exclusion questions to be asked as part of the pre-screening process.
5.0 Consent  Process and Documentation 
5.1 Consent  Process 
 
5.1.1 Obtaining  Informed Consent
[IP_ADDRESS] Timing  and Location of Consent
After the  subject has completed a pre-screening and has agreed to participate in the study, 
consent will be obtained. If the participant has an upcoming clinic visit, the informed 
consent process will take place in our infertility clinic, located at [ADDRESS_1079614] and a study 
coordinator along with a witness on the study coordinator’s end. The participant, along 
with the study coordinator and witness will sign the consent documents.  Participants will 
then mail, scan, or fax the signed consent form back to the study staff.  Study staff will then 
attach the witness signature [CONTACT_784810] a copy of all 
pages to the subject. No study procedures will be conducted before the patient signs the 
informed consent and any investigators who are not authorized to perform consenting 
procedures will not do so. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Coercion  or Undue Influence during Consent
Study subjects will  be provided the study information from their clinician along with all 
other options currently available for infertility treatment. It will be the subject’s decision 
to pursue the study. If the subject completes the pre-screening process and is interested 
in the study, the subject can opt to proceed with the study. If the subject decides to not 
participate, they will not be swayed otherwise. The subject’s decision to participate or 
not to participate in the study will not affect their care. 
5.1.2 Waiver  or alteration of the informed consent requirement
A partial  waver of consent has been requested for recruitment purposes in order to use chart 
review to identify patients who are potentially eligible for the study so that they can be 
approached to determine if they are interested in participating.

subject so that they do not have to come in solely to sign the consent form and allow 
researchers the ability to randomize the patient prior to their arrival for the procedure so as to 
minimize delays in the visit.  
5.2.2 Waiver  of Documentation of Consent (Implied consent, Verbal consent, etc.)
A waiver  of documentation of consent is requested for recruitment purposes. Verbal consent 
will be obtained from potential subjects prior to asking the Pre-Screening questions.

7.2.3 Baseline Assessments/Study Intervention
Case report  forms documenting the history will be obtained, the Ferti-QOL (12) quality of life 
survey will be obtained.  Serum for Anti-Chlamydial antibodies as well as Free T4 and TSH will be 
drawn before or after the Sono HSG depending on the patient’s reason for visit, as often a 
baseline progesterone and hCG level are obtained prior to the Sono HSG if the patient is to go 
on immediately to treatment.  The rationale for the Anti-Chlamydial antibodies is that we have 
shown they are associated with failure to conceive and pregnancy loss including ectopic 
pregnancies in our prospective randomized controlled trials (9).  Samples drawn for anti-
chlamydial antibodies will be sent to the study sponsor’s laboratory for analysis.  Free T4 and 
TSH will be collected in order to assess thyroid function.  A urine pregnancy test will be 
performed.  We will then proceed with the Sono HSG. This begins first with a routine pelvic 
ultrasound.  Then a speculum is inserted into the vagina and then the Sono HSG catheter is 
inserted through the cervical canal into the uterine cavity and the balloon is inflated to maintain 
a seal at the cervical canal.    A special device, i.e. the FemVue system, will then be used to 
infuse normal saline while at the same time creating bubbles to ease ultrasound visualization.   
The speculum is removed and the transvaginal ultrasound probe is inserted.  The Sono HSG 
begins with infusion of normal saline via the FemVue catheter.   After a patient has had an SHG 
with a normal cavity and at least one patent tube as determined by [CONTACT_784801], 
the patient will receive the study contrast or control saline which will be in an opaque glass 
syringe and connected to the uterine catheter via opaque tubing to allow double blinding of 
physician and patient. The study agent will be shaken vigorously to induce turbulence and air 
bubbles to ease tracking of the agent and then infused in 2 cc increments under ultrasound

Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines for treatment.(13)  Currently, based on Level I 
evidence that would be clomiphene/IUI for unexplained infertility (14) and letrozole with timed 
intercourse for polycystic ovary syndrome.(15) The initial consent will allow access to all medical 
records in the Electronic Health Record including any resulting pregnancy.   Data collected will 
include any potential adverse events as well as information on the participant’s course of 
infertility treatment/any resulting pregnancy outcomes up to [ADDRESS_1079622] visit to our infertility clinic to obtain release of these 
records at the end of the 6 month participation in the study (or longer if a patient conceives at 
the end of the 6 month window of study participation).  We will not follow any conceptions that 
occur more than [ADDRESS_1079623] (6 months + 2 weeks)

8.[ADDRESS_1079627]  Numbers and Statistical Plan
8.1 Number  of Subjects
Fifty-six subjects  will be randomized and receive study intervention, twenty-eight per randomization 
arm.  We estimate that we will need to screen one hundred patients in order to meet this goal. 
STUDY00008466
Approval: 9/7/2021
Page 13  of 19 (V.04/27/2017) 8.2 Sample  size determination
For pi[INVESTIGATOR_784788] 12 to 60 subjects per 
group would provide sufficient data to obtain estimates of the primary outcome in order to power a 
future definitive clinical trial, as well as provide sufficient evidence to assess feasibility, blinding safety, 
and regulatory considerations.(16) A sample size of 50 evaluable subjects (25 per group) should be 
sufficient in order to satisfy the goals of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (i.e., feasibility of binding the contrast medium, 
obtaining estimates for a formal power calculation of a future trial, and evaluating the safety of the 
contrast medium). We anticipate, however, that 10% of the subjects will either drop-out prior to study 
completion or be randomized but not be able to have a Sono HSG performed because they change their 
minds during the procedure and opt out or they have bilateral tubal occlusion or a hydrosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_2116]. 
Also, subjects may  not be evaluable as result of technical errors associated with manipulation of the required 
glass syringe for study drug administration.  Therefore, we will recruit a minimum of [ADDRESS_1079628] reached the goal of 50 evaluable subjects.  
8.3 Statistical  methods
The analysis dataset  will follow a modified intention to treat (mITT) where all evaluable subjects will be 
analyzed.  For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], an evaluable subject is a subject that has been randomized and has 
completed the Sono HSG.
Descriptive statistics  for continuous data will be reported as the mean (standard deviation) or as the 
median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) if the distribution is not normally distributed. Descriptive 
statistics for categorical will be reported as a frequency and percentage. All hypothesis tests will be two-
sided and tested at a significance level of 0.05. All analyses will be conducted using SAS software, 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) or R software, version 3.3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria).
8.3.1. Primary  Endpoint Analysis
A Pearson’s  chi-square test, or Fisher’s exact test if the expected cell counts are <5, will be used 
to compare the proportion of subjects with an ongoing pregnancy (for all pregnancies identified 
by 6 mos after Sono HSG) between the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]® and saline groups. A relative risk and 95% 
confidence interval will be used to quantify the effect size.
8.3.2. Secondary  Endpoint Analysis
A two-sample t-test  will be used to compare the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]® to saline groups with respect to 
continuous outcomes, such as VAS scores, change in Ferti-QOL scores from baseline to [ADDRESS_1079629] size from the two-sample t-tests 
will be quantified using the difference in means and 95% confidence interval. In the event the 
data do not meet parametric assumptions, the data will either be transformed (e.g., a 
logarithmic transformation) in order to satisfy parametric assumptions or a non-parametric 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to compare the treatment groups.
A Pearson’s  chi-square test, or Fisher’s exact test if the expected cell counts are <5, will be used 
to compare the live birth proportions, as well as detectability (yes/no) for anti-chlamydial 
antibodies, between the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]® and saline groups. A relative risk and 95% confidence

10.3 Method of collection  of safety information
The occurrence  of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor, Allen 
Kunselman. All AEs will be captured on the appropriate CRF and include event description, time of onset, 
clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_10263] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event.  
10.[ADDRESS_1079631] all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At 
each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events 
will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.

Annual reports  will be made to the Penn State IRB as per the current protocol.  Data will also be 
monitored by [CONTACT_784806]. 
10.7 Statistical  tests
A Pearson’s  chi-square test, or Fisher’s exact test if the expected cell counts are <5, will be used to 
compare each reported AE between the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]® and saline groups, provided there are sufficient 
AEs to obtain inference.
10.8 Suspension  of research
This study may  be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by [CONTACT_784807], Princeton, NJ.  If the study is 
prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33894](s)

Page 15  of 19 (V.04/27/2017) 11.0 Risks
The immediate  risks of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]®  for HSG are lower than the other indicated uses, since the major risks are 
related to intravasation and associated anaphylactic and/or embolism events.  While there is evidence of 
intravasation during conventional fluoroscopic HSG(10), there has been only one case report of a cergral 
embolization event related to this, with a 12 day coma and ICU stay after HSG that resolved without sequelae. 
(11).  The immediate risks include discomfort or pain from the infusion into the uterine cavity, an anaphylactic or 
allergic reaction to Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_784778]®, and embolization after intravasation.  The long term risks include formation of 
granulomas and/or pelvic adhesions and late sequelae of intravastion.
There is  a risk of loss of confidentiality if information is obtained by [CONTACT_127774].  
Precautions will be taken to prevent this as described in Section 9. 
There is  a risk that the questionnaires may make participant uncomfortable.
Risks of  standard venipuncture include slight pi[INVESTIGATOR_784790], discomfort, black and blue mark at the site of 
puncture, small blood clot, infection or bleeding at the site, and fainting during the procedure.
Risks associated with  Sonohysterogram/Hysterosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_784791], bleeding, damage to the uterus, 
pelvic infection, interrupting an unrecognized pregnancy , small amount of radiation exposure, and allergic 
reaction to the radio-opaque dye.  
Risks associated with  randomization. One treatment may be less effective or have more side effects than the 
other research treatment or other available treatments.

 For Part 1 t here could be a second visit in which we ask patient’s feedback 
on different device protypes regarding how they look and how comfortable 
they are. Both visits could take place on the same day.  The device will not 
function while you are wearing it.  
 
For Part 2 the DOVE prototype device is a wearable device . 
Subjects will be ask to wear the differen t prototypes of the device 
during the study visit to assess comfort and design.  The device will 
not function while you are wearing it.  
Statistical 
Methodology  Survey answers will be entered into a RedCap database and 
responses will be aggregated and  summarized using descriptive 
statistics. To compare differences survey responses among study 
participant  subgroups, we will use t -tests or Wilcoxon rank -sum 
tests (F -tests or Kruskal -Wallis test) for  continuous variables and 
Pearson chi square tests or Fis hers exact tests for categorical 
variables. Linear  and logistic regression will be used to assess for 
differences in the continuous and dichotomous  outcomes, 
respectively. All hypothesis tests will be two -sided using a two -
sided alpha of 0.05 as our  thresh old for statistical significance. 
We will use Stata and/or SAS to analyze the data.  
 
BACKGROUND AND STUDY  RATIONALE  
This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable University of 
Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and State 
laws and regulations including [as applicable include the following regulations as they 
apply 45 CFR 46 , 21 CFR Parts 50 , 54, 56, and 812 and Good Clinical Practice : 
Consolidated Guidelines approved by [CONTACT_284572][INVESTIGATOR_284541].  
1 Introduction  
In 2017, 70,237 people died following an accidental overdose in the [LOCATION_002].1 Of 
those, 47,600 (6 7.8%) died following an opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], a rate of one death every [ADDRESS_347539] affected cities.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211] -related statistics  are 
staggering and heartbreaking. Philadelphia County (City of Philadelphia) had th e second 
highest rates of drug overdose deaths per county in [ZIP_CODE]. Although nationally 68% of 
drug deaths involved opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], more than 80% of drug deaths i n Philadelphia involved 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_284542] 3 fatal incidents per day.5,6 In the decade between 
2007 and 2017, 5670 individuals died following an opi[INVESTIGATOR_284543]. Until 
it plateaued in 2017, the number of fatal incidents increased every year.6

 Page 4 1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
In many instances, tragic overdose deaths could be avoided.3 Within 5 minutes of an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], an individual has irreversible brain damage caused by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_1399]. 
Naloxone is a med ication used to block the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], especially in overdose. 
Naloxone may be combined with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_284544]. When 
given intravenously, Naloxone works within two minutes, and when injected into a muscle, 
it works with in five minutes; it may also be sprayed into the nose. The effects of Naloxone 
last about half an hour to an hour. Multiple doses may be required . If desired response is 
not obtained, doses should be repeated at 2 to 3 minute intervals.  Without interventio n, 
preventable deaths continue to occur [  
Figure 1]. Life-threatening opi[INVESTIGATOR_284545], administer Naloxone [ Figure 2]. 
 
Figure 1: Overdose Progression with Naloxone Intervention  
 
Figure 2: Overdose Progression without Naloxone Intervention  
 
At the time of op ioid overdose, the person overdosing not only needs to have Naloxone 
available, but they need another person to administer the Naloxone, and quickly. Since 
someone is needed to administer, the by[CONTACT_284573], at the minimum, 
comfortable administering the drug. While the American Heart Association added 
Naloxone administration as a special situation for the cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR) training in 2015, the median county training rates are generally low.8,[ADDRESS_347540] 2.39%10. Still, the by[CONTACT_284574]. Since 1999, a patient was found alone following fatal overdose in 70,000 
cases.11 While Naloxone is readily available today, many overdose victims are not found 
in time for adm inistration of Naloxone. After five minutes without Naloxone intervention, 
a patient may continue to decompensate, become permanently disabled, or die.1 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_284546] 
1970’s, the  rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_284547].[ADDRESS_347541] be independent of variables that require human action.  
 
While a strategy for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_284548], 
designers  may also be inclined to reconsider how the medication is deployed. Two major 
strategies are (1) for more individuals to carry Naloxone and (2) for more distribution 
points for Naloxone13–16. In Pennsylvania, Secretary of Health Rachel Levine issued a 
blank et standing order to permit over the counter Naloxone distribution: “this standing 
order may be used by [CONTACT_284575] a prescription or third -party prescription to 
obtain Naloxone from a pharmacy in the event that they are unable to obtain Naloxone o r 
a prescription for Naloxone from their regular health care providers or another source.”[ADDRESS_347542]  
Device name: [CONTACT_284587]: The device is a de novo device called the DOVE  (Delivery of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_284549]) Device.   During part [ADDRESS_347543] reversal -agent 
response in a device is novel, predicate devices sense physiological variables and 
administer a drug in  response to a change in the physiological variable. For example, the 
FreeO 2 wearable device monitors hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284550] 2.18 In 
response to SpO 2 below the target range, the device adjusts a valve that changes O 2 
flow. 18 Likewise, a sweat -based glucose monitor (EOFlow) has been proposed in 
conjunction with transdermal glucose delivery.19  
 
Device category : 
Category B Device  
Intended use:  During Part [ADDRESS_347544] 
not done pre -clinical testing.  Like FreeO 2’s pulse oximetry, DOVE would analyze 
physiologically associated waveforms and test whether those waveforms elicit a threshold 
that prompts the agent to response.  
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of Part 1 is to determine the  opi[INVESTIGATOR_284551]’s need for a 
wearable device that will treat an opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]. The primary objective of Part 2 is to  
obtain descriptive data and functional data on DOVE device prototype s. Naloxone will not 
be administered during the trial. Examples of data collected are:  
 Study participant will be asked about their opi[INVESTIGATOR_284552] . 
 Accessibility to Naloxo ne. 
 Study participant will be asked to evaluate potential wearable device designs  
(Part 2 only).  
 Study participant evaluates which devices would be more helpful in terms of 
detection and comfort  (Part 2 only).

 Assess frequency of opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211].  
[ADDRESS_347546]’s verbal feedback, in order 
to guide the process of optimi zing the device.  At the end of Part 2, we will have optimized 
the design of the device for comfort and design preference. In part 2 there may be follow -
up testing. Naloxone will not be administered during the study . 
3.1.2  Screening Phase  
Subjects will be recruited directly from clinics associated with the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71972], physician referrals, and IRB -approved advertisements 
targeting the Delaware Valley region.  If a potential study participant i s considered to b e 
eligible, he/she will be referred to the research staff to participate in the initial telephone 
screening. A series of questions will be asked over the phone to confirm eligibility. 
Potential subjects that are eligible based on study criteria will be bro ught in for the 
baseline visit. Study participant may also be enrolled in clinic. The screening and baseline 
visit may occur on the same day.  
3.1.2  Study Design Phase  
The wearable design phase ( WDP) will consist of wearing the DOVE device for part [ADDRESS_347547] comfort . Subjects could be given the option of completing part 1

9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should 
be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be  adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_284578] , the FDA defines an adverse event as the following:  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans whether or not considered drug related.  
9.1.2  Serious Adverse  Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  
A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the ot her serious outcomes noted above.  For example, 
drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_48517].  
 
All adverse even ts that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events .  
9.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
Any AE/ADE will be recorded by [CONTACT_284579], and 
signed off by [CONTACT_978]. Recording of ad verse events will begin when the first subject is 
enrolled and will end when the last subject has completed all study procedures. 
Unanticipated adverse events (serious and non -serious) will be reported to the Penn IRB, 
in accordance with federal and instit utional requirements.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   
 Page [ADDRESS_347558] via inspection 
and palpation. Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the 
adverse event case report form (CRF).   
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period (from study intervention start to end 
of the study) will be recorded by [CONTACT_2710].  The clinical course of each event 
will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study 
intervention or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse event s that are still ongoing 
at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any 
serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly 
related to the study intervention or study participat ion will be recorded and reported 
immediately.  
9.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
All adverse events and adverse device effects will be reported according to the timeline 
below:  
 
Serious Adverse Event  Within [ADDRESS_347559] conform to the adverse event reporting timelines, formats and 
requirements o f the various entities to which they are responsible.

Certain events are required to be reported to the IRB in an expedited fashion as per 
21 CFR 812.150:  
 Device Recall, Repair, or Disposal : If the device manufacturer requests a recall, 
repair, or disposal of the DOVE  device, the IRB will be notified within [ADDRESS_347562] devic e recall.  
 Failure to Obtain Consent : If an investigator fails to obtain informed consent, the 
IRB must be notified within 5 working days.  
 Final Report : A final report on the study will be submitted to IRB within 6 months 
of study completion.  
Additionally all other events (see list below) will be recorded and reported with respect 
to institutional and federal policies as described in the Penn Manual . All events as 
defined above will be reported to the Penn IRB by [CONTACT_284580] .  
 Any adverse event that would  cause the sponsor to modify the protocol or informed 
consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_284581].  
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the 
research, in terms of severit y or frequency. For example:  
 An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected.  
 Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more 
frequent than initially exp ected.  
 A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research

10.1.1 Additional reportin g requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND/IDE safety reports all previous reports 
concerning similar adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current event in 
light of the previous reports.  
10.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original docum ents, 
and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, 
recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_58620], microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at 
the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical  trial. 
 10.3 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  
All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If 
a space on the CRF is left blank beca use the procedure was not done or the question 
was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  
All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to 
correct such an error,  draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the 
correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE 
OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the 
clarification ab ove the item, then initial and date it.  
 
[ADDRESS_347563] of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  of the 
following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorizat ion for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of 
subject authorization.   
 
Full privacy wil l be expected to each participant in the study. To identify potential subjects 
in the study, research personnel responsible for consenting and enrollment will identify 
potential subjects via active lists of patients and referrals from clinical faculty. Res earch

If enrolled in clinic: The potential subject will be alone in the room without risk of having 
patient’s privacy compromised during enrollment/consent. If there are family members or 
friends around a potential subject at time of enrollment/consent, potential s ubjects will be 
asked if they are comfortable discussing the study in the setting of other individuals.  
 
If enrolled via telephone encounter: The study participant will first be asked if he is 
interested in talking to research personnel about possible enr ollment. They will have the 
opportunity to ask us to call back another time.  
 
All research personnel will follow privacy guidelines as described in CITI training 
biomedical and good behavior research modules, as required by [CONTACT_284582].  
[ADDRESS_347565] safety. The study team and sponsor  will meet periodically to 
review the progress of the study, paying particular attention to any missing data – to 
ensure that all forms are completed on schedule and all data is entered, verified and 
available for analysis. Data will be stored in password protected files, on a secure 
research server with data backup preformed nightly. Protected health information linking 
the assigned unique identifier to the subject identity will only be kept as an electronic 
document and will be held on the shared Penn Medicine e-drive. This document will be 
password protected and only study personnel will have access. Study files  will be kept in 
a locked filing cabinet. Data will be maintained in locked files to which only authorized 
study personnel will have access. Data collected will be entered in RedCap , excel and/or 
CTMS . 
13 Records Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_347566]. These documents should be retained for a longer period if re quired by [CONTACT_284583]. In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor to 
inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be 
retained.

 Page 19 14 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
The primar y investigator will be responsible for monitoring all information. The investigator 
will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.   
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_28923]/IRB and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, 
study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable 
study -related fac ilities.  
 15 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulations 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional 
research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol a nd any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted 
independent Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement 
with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of 
the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and 
a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before commencement of this study.  
[ADDRESS_347567] confidentiality is  maintained. This risk has been mitigated by [CONTACT_284584], a highly secure data  storage system at Pen n Medicine, and 
a plan to remove identifiers from the data wherever possible. In addition, all study 
personnel will be held to high standards of upholding confidentiality and  safeguarding 
patient privacy. To ensure that patient  confidentiality is preserved , individual identifiers 
(such as name) are stored in a single password protected system that is accessible to the 
principle  investigator and research team . This system is hosted on site at Penn Medicine 
and is protected by a secure f irewall. Any datasets and computer files that leave the 
firewall will be stripped of all identifiers besides  the study ID. The study ID will also be 
used on all analytical files. Confidentiality of all study data will be  maintained by [CONTACT_284585].

It is the investigators’ belief that the benefits to society outweigh the minimal risks with 
the device.  
17.2  Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorizatio n  
All study subjects who meeting enrollment criteria will be required to provide personal 
consent. Primarily, the research coordinator will obtain consent, but other IRB approved 
study personnel will be permitted to obtain consent.  
 
Consent will be obtai ned, when possible, via in person paper consent. Once the form is 
completed and signed by [CONTACT_284586], all consent forms will be placed 
with other securely stored documents.  
During the consent process, the consent form will be reviewed, a s well as the description 
of the questionnaire, device and study procedures, the purpose of the study, the risks and 
benefits, and the voluntary nature of research participation.  
  
To prevent coercion and ensure all information is understood, subjects will  have the 
opportunity to ask as many questions as they need and will have the option to withdrawal 
from the study.

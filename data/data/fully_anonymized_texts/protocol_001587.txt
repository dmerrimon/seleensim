 Protocol Summary  
Title: A randomized open -label trial of deprescribing proton pump inhibitors to reduce the risk of 
hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation.  
Precis: A total of 40 patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) who undergo transjugular 
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation as part of routine clinical care will be 
randomized in 1:[ADDRESS_1041866] -TIPS hepatic 
encephalopathy (HE). Patients will be assessed for symptoms of minimal HE (MHE), using the 
established psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) b attery of tests. MHE 
assessment will be conducted at two timepoints: at baseline prior to randomization and TIPS 
creation and approximately 4 weeks after randomization and TIPS creation. Stool samples will 
also be collected at both timepoints to allow char acterization of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing. The pre to post -TIPS change in PHES scores will be 
compared between patients randomized to continue versus discontinue their PPIs. Quality of life 
(QOL) will also be asse ssed. Changes in the GI tract microbiome will be analyzed to determine 
whether this represents a potential biological mechanism linking PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760751] -TIPS HE.  
Objectives: The primary objective is to determine whether discontinuation of PPIs reduces the  
risk of post -TIPS HE. Additional secondary objectives will include a comparison of cirrhosis -
specific and gastroesophageal reflux disease -specific QOL in the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760752]. An exploratory objective  is to determine whether PPI  [INVESTIGATOR_760753] a potential biological mechanism mediating PPI-induced 
risk of post -TIPS HE.  
Endpoints: Change in PHES pre to post -TIPS  by [CONTACT_7586] -to-treat (ITT)  (primary endpoint). Per-
protocol change in PHES; chan ge in Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) and Quality 
of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia (QOLRAD) scores pre to post -TIPS (secondary endpoints). 
Mediation analysis of GI tract bacterial taxon abundances as a potential link be tween PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760754] -TIPS  HE (exploratory endpoint).

 2 Introduction: Background Information and Scientific Rat ionale  
2.1 Background Information  
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation is an important minimally invasive 
procedure for treatment of complications resulting from cirrhosis and portal hypertension (1). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_760756], gastrointestinal (GI) variceal bleeding risk, and 
in certain settings survival (2, 3) , development of hepatic encephalopathy  (HE) after TIPS can 
limit use of this  procedu re. HE is the most common complication of TIPS, occurring in 30% to 
60% of patients (4). Medical therapy for HE, though effective, can be expensive (5) and cause 
unpleasant side effects  (6). Thus , in patients who ex perience post -TIPS HE, the reduction in 
quality of life (QOL) can negate other  beneficial effects of TIPS  (7, 8) . Furthermore , the cost of 
HE related care is substantial, estimated at  $5,370 -$50,120 per patient per  year (9). Therefore , 
additional strategies to reduce the risk of p ost-TIPS HE are needed.  
Recent retrospective studies have shown an association between  proton pump inhibitor (PPI) 
use and HE in cirrhotic patients (10-20). Meta -analyses have supported a small but significantly 
increased risk of HE among cirrhotic patients taking PPIs, with pooled odds ratios ranging from 
1.50 to 2.58 (21-24). Among these studies, two focused exclusively on TIPS patients and 
described a more robust effect  size in this high risk population with a greater than [ADDRESS_1041869] -TIPS HE among PPI [CONTACT_8333] (19, 20) . In an independent, unpublished 
dataset of [ADDRESS_1041870] -TIPS HE (Figure 1).  
 
Figure 1: Patient timelines after TIPS showing intervals of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760757] (left 
panel). Incidence rate ratios showing statistically significantly increased rates of post -TIPS  HE 
with PPI [CONTACT_3225] (middle panel) and with increasing PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760758] (right panel).  
Biological mechanisms to account for the association between PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760759] , but a potential pathway involves alterations in the GI tract microbiome.  Randomized 
placebo controlled  studies have demonstrated that PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760760]  (25). These changes, characterized by [CONTACT_760827] a more alkaline stomach, appear to be reversible upon discontinuation of 
PPIs  (25, 26) . Separate observat ional studies have characterized the differences in GI flora 

13 
 between cirrhotic patients with HE versus those without HE (27). In patients with HE, reduced 
levels of Lachnospi[INVESTIGATOR_300594], Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridiales and increased 
Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaeae closely mirror the changes caused by  [CONTACT_67164] [CONTACT_3225] (25, 
27). Thus, given the concordant changes in the lower GI tra ct microbiome seen with PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760761], these bacterial taxa could  play a role in mediating HE. However, other 
mechanisms, such as a simple effect of pH , are also plausible . Lactulose, long established as 
an effective treatment for HE, is a colonic acidifying agent (28). In a reduced pH environment in 
the colon, ammonia is protonated to the less well absorbed ammonium ion, which is thus 
excreted (28). By [CONTACT_760828], PPIs may counteract this process.  
PPIs are among the most commonly used medications, but a Cochrane review has reported 
that 25% to 70% of patients may be prescribed a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760762] (29). Among TIPS 
patients, 60% to 75% take PPIs (19, 20) . While s hort courses of PPIs are indicated for ulcer 
disease (30, 31)  and possibly for prevention of esophageal variceal band ligation ulcers (32), 
PPIs do not appear in practice guidelines for prevention and management of portal hypertensive 
bleeding in cirrhotic patients (33). Thus , discontinuation of inessential PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760763] a simple and cost effective intervention to reduce the 
risk of post -TIPS HE.  
Since the link between PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760764], observat ional data and 
because biological mechanisms remain unexplored, this protocol proposes a prospective, 
randomized study design to more definitively support or refute a role for PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760765] a risk factor 
for HE. Such a study design would more clearly determin e whether discontinuation of PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_760766] -TIPS HE  and may also provide  mechanistic  insights into the 
interplay between upper GI tract pH, the GI tract microbiome, and HE . 
2.[ADDRESS_1041871] -TIPS does not imply that discontinuation of PPIs 
would reduce rates of HE in these patients. Second, a Cochrane review of randomized PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_760767] ( GERD ) 
symptoms in patients who stopped their PPIs (29). Therefore, even if PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760768] -TIPS HE, the harm ful effects from worsening  GERD in patients 
discontinuing  PPIs may outweigh the beneficial reduction in post -TIPS HE. Third, retrospective 
observation al studies provide few insights into biological mechanisms . Therefore, even if 
discontinuation of PPIs was known to be beneficial , this narrow strategy would fail to advance 
the understanding of physiologic  connections between upper GI tract pH, the GI tract 
microbiome, and HE.  
Rationale for microbiome analysis  
[ADDRESS_1041872] microbiome via statistical mediation analysis as 
illustrated in Figure 2  (34). Scenario A depi[INVESTIGATOR_27039]  a direct effect of PPIs on HE. Scenario B depi[INVESTIGATOR_760769]. The microbiome is considered a mediator if (1) PPIs are causally related to 
HE (i.e. c ≠ 0 in scenario A), (2) PPIs are causally related to microbiome change (i.e. a ≠ 0 in 
scenario B), and (3 ) the microbiome significantly predicts HE after controlling for PPI [CONTACT_3225] (i.e. b 
≠ 0 in scenario B). Complete mediation is said to occur if  c’ = 0 (i.e. the impact of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760770]), whereas partial 
medi ation is said to occur if c’ ≠ 0 
(i.e. PPIs affect the risk of HE both 
through the microbiome but also 
through other unexplained 
mechanisms, such as a direct effect 
of pH). Formal statistical methods 
for quantifying such relationships in 
mediation analysis  have been 
described (34). 
Figure 2: Arrows demonstrate 
directionality of hypothesized causal 
chains linking PPI [CONTACT_3225] , the 
microbiome,  and post -TIPS HE.   
Rationale for a deprescribing trial 
This protocol proposes a randomized deprescribing study design, whereby [CONTACT_760829]. Because currently 
available retrospective data suggest PPIs may increase  risk of HE, it woul d be potentially  
unethical to administer PPIs to patients not already on these agents. In contrast, a deprescribing 
trial, where patients are randomized to continue or discontinue a potentially ineffective or 
harmful medication , can be considered in such c ircumstances (35). Such deprescribing trials 
are w ell accepted in the field of geriatrics to combat polypharmacy  and reduce pi[INVESTIGATOR_13551] , and 
PPIs have been the focus of multiple deprescribing trials (29). 
Rationale for studying TIPS patients  
This study focuses on deprescribing PPIs in the subset of cirrhotic patients undergoing TIPS 
creation. While a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760771], HE represents an acute clinical problem in TIPS patients and prevention 
and management of HE in this group remains a challenge  (36). Retrospective studies  have 
shown greater than 3 fold higher r ates of HE associated with PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760772]  (19, 
20), compared with 1.50 to 2.58 fold higher rates among cirrhotic patients in general (21-24). 

[ADDRESS_1041873] been character ized in a deprescribing 
trial conducted in 164 patients age 65 and older with a history of acute grade I -III esophagitis 
(37): 
● GERD : heartburn (54.8% in discontinuation arm vs 8.3% in PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760773]), acid 
regurgitation (41.9% vs 12.5%)  
● Esophagitis  documented by [CONTACT_235127] : 69.6% vs 20.4%  
● Other rare adverse events ( AEs) occurring in both arms: glossitis, headache, diarrhea , 
cardiac arrhythmia, urticaria , abdominal pain, impotence, dysuria, leukopenia, pruritus, 
dizziness  
 
Patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers, grade IV esophagitis  (deep ulcer or esophagitis with 
complications) were excluded from this study. No ulcers, comp lications from esophagitis, or 
cases of grade IV esophagitis were reported in the discontinuation arm.

3 Objec tives and Purpose  
 
Primary objective: To determine whether discontinuation of PPIs in patients undergoing TIPS 
creation reduces the risk of post -TIPS HE, as assessed by [CONTACT_760830] ( PHES ) tests of minimal hepatic encephalopath y (MHE ). 
Secondary objectives: To determine whether discontinuation of PPIs impacts chronic liver 
disease or GERD related QOL, as asse ssed by [CONTACT_760831] 
(CLDQ ) and Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia ( QOLRAD ) surveys.  
Explo ratory objectives: To perform mediation analysis to determine whether the relationship 
between PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760774] -TIPS HE is driven by [CONTACT_760832], 
characterized through 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples.  
4 Study Design and Endpoint s 
4.1 Description of the Study Design  
16 
 The proposed study is a single center randomized, open -label , deprescribing trial of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760775].  The study will involve two arms : the experimental/PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760776] s top taking their PPIs prior to TIPS creation and the control/PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_760777].  
Patients will be assessed for MHE using the PHES test battery and for QOL using the CLDQ 
and QOLRAD surveys prior to randomization, and approximately [ADDRESS_1041875] completed the study.  
4.2 Study Endpoints  
4.2.1  Primary Endpoint

● Active Helicobacter pylori infectio n 
● Pregnancy  
5.3 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Potential patients will be identified by [CONTACT_760834] (IR) clinical team at the time 
of referral for TIPS creation . At the time of referral for TIPS, patients will be screened for 
eligibility and exclusion criteria. Potential study candidates will be contact[CONTACT_760835].  Patients who are 
potentially interested in participating will then have the opportunit y to undergo a formal written 
informed consent discussion at the time of the pre -TIPS IR clinic visit. No compensation will be 
provided for study participation.  
5.4 Participant Withdrawal or Termination  
5.4.1  Reasons for Withdrawal or Termination  
An inves tigator may terminate participation in the study if:  
● Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs 
such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant  
● The participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_1041879] unde rgone any study related 
intervention. Therefore, replacement of these participants will be permitted. Any patients who  
undergo randomization and withdraw prior to completion of the study  will be analyzed according 
to the principle of ITT. 
5.5 Premature Ter mination or Suspension of Study  
18 
 This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_305088]( s) for the termination or suspension.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
● Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
● Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stop pi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
● Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
● Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
● Determination of futility  
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, data quality are 
addressed and satisfy the IRB.  
6 Study Agent  
Patients will be randomized to receive instructions to stop their existing PPI [CONTACT_48831] 
(experimental/discontinuation/deprescribing arm) or to receive no specific instructions regarding 
PPI [CONTACT_48831] (control/continuation arm). Therefore, considerati ons related  to storage, handling, 
formulation, and labeling of  study agent are not applicable.  
7 Study Procedures and Schedule  
7.1 Study Procedures/Evaluations  
7.1.1  Study Specific Procedures  
The following will study specific procedures will occur:  
● Prior t o randomization, all patients will undergo assessment of MHE, using the 
established PHES battery of pencil -and-paper tests (Figure 3), QOL assessments using 
the CLDQ and QOLRAD surveys, and will be provided with return -by-mail at home stool 
collection kits  
● Patients will be randomized to either receive instructions to immediately discontinue their 
PPI, or to receive no specific instructions regarding their PPI  
● Patients in the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760783], to attempt lifestyle interventions to counteract 
GERD symptoms (e.g. smoking cessation, avoiding late evening meals, and head -of-
the-bed elevation) (40), and to use on -demand over -the-counter histamine H2 blocker 
therapy for intolerable  GERD symptoms  
● Approximately 4 weeks following TIPS creation, all patients will undergo reassessment 
of MHE and QOL and will be provided with return -by-mail at home stool collection kits  
● At the completion  of the study, all patients will be invited to resum e or discontinu e PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_760784], gastroenterology, 
and IR physician s  
19 
  
Figure 3: PHES tests from (41). 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1041880] of care for all patients undergoing TIPS creation : 
● After receiving a referral TIPS creation , the treating IR physician reviews the patient’s 
electronic medical records including history, medications, allergies, physical examination  
and imaging findings, and laboratory tests  to evaluate the pati ent’s candidacy for the 
procedure  
● All patients referred for TIPS creation undergo a pre procedure consultation with the 
treating IR physician  
● All TIPS procedures are performed under general anesthesia. Portal vein access is 
achieved using intracardiac echo cardiography/intravascular ultrasound guid ance.  
Controlled expansion covered Viatorr covered stent grafts are deployed and dilated to 
achieve a target reduction in the portosystemic pressure gradient of 50% or <12 mm Hg 
for varices and <8 mm Hg for ascites  (1). Patients are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_760785].  
● Patients undergo routine follow up with the IR clinical team approximately 4 weeks after 
TIPS creation.  
7.2 Laboratory Proce dures/Evaluations  
7.2.1  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Routine clinical laboratory evaluation prior to TIPS procedure includes assessment of a 
complete metabolic panel, complete blood count, and coagulation studies (prothrombin 
time/international normaliz ed ratio). These laboratory evaluations are performed as part of 
standard of care for patients undergoing TIPS creation. No study specific clinical laboratory 
assessments are proposed.

gut-kit/OMR -200.100.html). Patient friendly instructions for use of this kit are available from the 
manufacturer and will be further explained to study participants by [CONTACT_10186]. Briefly, a t home 
after stooling, patients use a small spat ula provided in the kit to obtain a stool sample which is 
placed in a stabilizing collection tube. The tube is then placed in a bio -specimen bag. Fecal 
samples collected with the OMNIgene -GUT kit can be stored at room temperature for up to [ADDRESS_1041882]. In 
accordance with IRB and HIPAA regulations, no PHI will be recorded during this screening 
evaluation.  
7.3.2  Enrollment/Baseline  
At the time of the routine pre -TIPS  IR clinic visit, patients who remain potentially interested i n 
participatin g in the study will meet with the study team CRC and informed written consent will be 
obtained from subjects who elect to participate.  Baseline MHE assessment via the PHES tests 
and QOL surveys will then be administered and home stool collect ion kits will be provided.

 8 Assessment of Safety  
8.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
Safety parameters included as secondary e ndpoints include epi[INVESTIGATOR_760791] s (see Section 4.2).  
8.1.1  Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered interven tion-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
8.1.2  Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adver se event, prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or result in prolong ation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgement, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent on of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples  of such medical events include  development of grade IV esophagitis, gastric or 
duodenal ulcers, or West -Haven grade 4 HE (e.g. comatose, unresponsive to pain, decorticate 
or decerebrate posturing) . 
8.1.3  Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
Unanticip ated problems involving risks to participants or others include, in general, any incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
● Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are des cribed in the protocol -related study documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant populations being studied;  
● Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]; and  
● Suggest that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized  
8.2 Classification of an Adverse Event (AE)  
8.2.1  Severity of Event  
Adverse events will be graded according to the following guidelines to describe severity : 
24 
 ● Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s 
daily activities.  
● Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference wit h functioning.  
● Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  
8.2.2  Relationship to Study Intervention  
For a ll collected A Es, the clinician who examines and evaluates the participant will determine 
the AE’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgement. The degree of 
certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below:  
● Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event occurs in a plausible 
time relationship to the study intervention  and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_760839] . 
● Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence 
of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event occurs within a reasonable time after the 
study intervention , is unlikely to be attri buted to concurrent disease or other medications . 
● Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after the study intervention ). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the  event (e.g. the participant’s clinical condition or other 
concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after 
discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to 
“probably related” or “definit ely related” as appropriate.  
● Unlikely to be Related – A clinical event whose temporal relationship to the study 
intervention makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g. the event did not occur within 
a reasonable time after the study intervention ) and in which other medications  or 
underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g. the participant’s clinical 
condition or other concomitant treatments).  
● Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention , and/or evidence 
exists that the  event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
8.2.3  Expectedness  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12824], MD PhD will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected 
or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
8.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
The occurrence  of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during the study 
or during  routine clinical monitoring following completion of the study . All A Es not meeting the 
25 
 criteria for SAEs will  be captured on the CRF. Information to be collected inclu des event 
description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to the study 
intervention  (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and 
time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All A Es occurr ing while on study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All A Es will be followed to adequate 
resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not repor ted as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. U Ps will be recorded in 
the data collection system throughout the study.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documente d to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each level of severity to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_760792] 7 (for non -serious A Es) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization.  
8.4 Reporting Procedures  
8.4.1  Adverse Event Reporting  
For any problem or AE requiring prompt reporting to the IRB but not meeting criteria for a SAE, 
within ten business days of the investigator becoming aware of the event, study personnel will 
send to the IRB a Safety Event submissio n in the eIRB.  
8.4.2  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The study clinician will complete a SAE Form within the following timelines:  
● Immediately (within 24 hours) upon learning of an unanticipated study -related death, 
study personnel will notify the IRB via e -mail or fax by [CONTACT_1541] a brief summary of the 
event. Then, within 1 week (five business days), study personnel will send to the IRB a 
Safety Event submission in the eIRB.  
● For a reportable SAE, study personnel will notify the IRB within five business day s of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event. Study personnel will send a Safety Event 
submission in the eIRB.  
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the investigator deems the event to 
be chronic or the adherence to be stabl e. Other supporting documentation of the event may be 
requested by [CONTACT_760840].  
8.4.3  Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
26 
 Incidents or events that meet the criteria for U Ps require the creation and completion of an UP 
report form. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_760793]. The UP report will include the following 
information:  
Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
● A detailed description of the event, incident, experience , or outcome;  
● An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP;  
● A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP . 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, U Ps will be reported using the following 
timeline:  
● UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB within 1 week (5 business days) of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event.  
● Any other UP will be report ed to the IRB within ten business days of the investigator 
becoming aware of the problem.

8.4.5  Reporting of Pregnancy  
Not applicable.  
8.5 Study Halting Rules  
The study intervention  will be halted when three  SAEs determined to be “definitely related” or 
“probably related” to PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760794].  
8.[ADDRESS_1041887] of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s). Audits 
may be performed at any time at the discretion of the Duke University Health System IRB.  
10 Statistical Considerations  
27 
 10.1 Statistical and Ana lytic Plans  
A separate statistical analysis plan  will not be created. See below for detailed description of the 
statistical analysis plan.  
10.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
 
Primary endpoint: The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760795] -TIPS. The alternative 
hypothesis is that there is a difference in the change in PHES pre versus post -TIPS in the PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_760796]:  
 
H0: µ+PPI = µ -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760797] H 1: µ+PPI ≠ µ -PPI 
 
[INVESTIGATOR_760798] µ +PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760799] , 
and µ -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760800].  
 
Secondary e ndpoints:  
 Per-protocol evaluation of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760801] -TIPS HE : The null hypothesis is 
that there is no difference in the change in PHES among patients  who adhered with PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_760802].  
 ITT analysis of the change in CLDQ and QOLRAD sco res: The null hypothesis is that 
there is no difference in the p re to post -TIPS change in CLDQ/ QOL RAD  scores among 
patients in the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760803].  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_155536]: The null hypothesis is that t here is no difference in the number of 
patients experiencing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_760804], defined as a West -Haven score greater 
than or equal to 2, in the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760805].  
 On-demand requirement for acid s uppression therapy: Descriptive statistics will be 
presented on the number of patients in the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760806] -demand 
use of histamine H2 blockers or PPIs.  
 Adverse events: The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the number  of 
patients experiencing an AE in the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760807].  
 
Exploratory endpoints:  
For analys es exploring  the role of the microbiome in mediating PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760808] -TIPS HE, the 
null hypothesis is that b = 0 and that c = c’ ( no mediation, see Figure 2). The alternative 
hypothesis is that b ≠ 0 and c’ < c (partial  or complete  mediation) (34). 
10.3 Analysis Datasets  
28 
 Analysis dataset s will include  all randomized patients (ITT analysis dataset) and patients who 
discontinued  PPI [CONTACT_48831]  (defined as those who used on -demand histamine H2 blockers or 
PPIs less than twi ce weekly) versus those who continued  PPIs  therapy (defined as a daily dose 
of a least 20 mg omeprazole equivalent ) (per-protocol analysis dataset).  
10.4 Description of Statistical Methods  
10.4.1  General Approach  
● For descriptive statistics, such as patient  demographics, means and ranges  will be 
reported for continuous variables , whereas counts and  percentages will be re ported for 
categorical variables.  
● For inferential tests , differences in sample means  will be assessed by [CONTACT_1192] -sided 
unpaired T -tests, whereas differences in proportions will be assessed by  [CONTACT_1192]-sided 
Fisher’ s exact tests.  
● For s tatistical mediation analysis, the non -parametric bootstrap method of Preacher and 
Hayes will be utilized (34).  
● For all inferential tests, a two -sided p -value less than 0.[ADDRESS_1041888] of 
the hypothesis H0: µ+PPI = µ -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760797] H1: µ+PPI ≠ µ -PPI. The estimate of µ +PPI, the mean difference 
in pre versus post -TIPS  PHES in the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760773], is derived from the sample mean:  
x̅+PPI = 1/n ∑ (xpost-TIPS,i – xpre-TIPS,i) 
 
Here x post-TIPS,i and x pre-TIPS,i are the PHES test scores [ADDRESS_1041889] in the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760809] a rm. The estimate of µ -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760810]. For the primary outcome analysis will be 
conducted according to the principle of ITT.  
 
10.4.3  Analysis of the Secondary  and Exploratory  Endpoints  
 Per-protocol evaluation of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760811] -TIPS HE: Statistical analysis will be 
conducted via a two -sided unpaired T-test of the hypothesis H 0: µ+PPI = µ -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760797] H1: 
µ+PPI ≠ µ -PPI. Here µ+PPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] µ -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760812] -TIPS change in PHES estimated 
from the sample means in the per -protocol dataset.  
 ITT analysis of the change in CLDQ and QOLRAD scores: Statistical analysis will be 
conducted via a two -sided unpaired T -test of the hypothesis H0: µ+PPI = µ -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760797] H1: 
µ+PPI ≠ µ -PPI. Here µ+PPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] µ -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760812] -TIPS change in QOL scores on the 
respective surveys, estimated in the ITT dataset.  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_155536]: Statistical analysis will be conducted via a t wo-sided Fisher’s 
exact test of the hypothesis H0: p+PPI = p -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760797] H1: p+PPI ≠ p -PPI. Here p+PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760813] 
[ADDRESS_1041890] -Haven grade 2 overt HE, and p -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760814].  
 On-demand requirement for acid suppression therapy: The proportion of patients in the 
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760815] -demand histamine H2 blockers and PPIs will be 
reported.  
 Adverse ev ents: Statistical analysis will be conducted via a two -sided Fisher’s exact test 
of the hypothesis H0: p+PPI = p -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760797] H1: p+PPI ≠ p -PPI. Here p+PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760816], and p -PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760817].  
 Exploratory analysis of the role of the GI tract microbiome in mediating PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760818]-TIPS HE: Analysis will be conducted using statistical mediation analysis (34, 43) . 
Criteria for assessing mediation a re based on the following equations:  
Y = µ 1 + c X + ε 1 
Mj = µ 2 + a X + ε 2 
Y = µ 3 + c’ X + b M j + ε [ADDRESS_1041891] -TIPS change for the ith patient.  X is an 
indicator vector where the ith element is 0 if the patient was randomized to the PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_760819] 1 otherwise.   The µ and ε terms rep resent intercepts and error 
terms, respectively. Variable M j is considered a mediator if the regression coefficients 
satisfy (1) c ≠ 0, (2) a ≠ 0, and (3) b ≠ 0. The non -parametric bootstrap test of Preacher 
and Hayes will be utilized to formally test thes e relationships (34). For microbiome 
studies, the mediating effects on HE are analyzed using relative abundances of bacterial 
taxa at the family and genus level s in a causal compositio nal mediation model (43). Due 
to the multiplicity of bacterial families and genera, the false discovery rate will be used 
for multiple tes ting correction (44). 
10.4.4 Safety Analyses  
Analyses of AEs will be performed as described above in Section 10.4.3.  
10.4.5  Adherence and Retention Analyses  
Analysis of on -demand acid suppression pharmaco therapy will be performed as described 
above in Section 10.4.3. No retention a nalyses are planned.  
10.4.6  Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Baseline characteristics of t he PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760820], 
including demographics , comorbidities , prior HE and anti -HE therapy, and TIPS procedure 
characteristics , using means and ranges  for continuous variables and counts and percentages 
for categorical variables. Inferential tests to assess differences in baseline characteristics of the 
30 
 groups will be performed using T -tests for continuous variables and Fisher’s e xact tests for 
categorical variables.  
10.4.7  Planned Interim Analyses

Not applicable.  
10.4.8  Additional Sub -Group Analysis  
Not applicable.  
10.4.9  Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity  
As described above in Section 10.4.3 the false discovery rate criteria of Benjamini and 
Hochberg (44) will be used for multiple testing correction in GI tract microbiome mediation 
analyses.  
10.4.[ADDRESS_1041892] microbiome are described above in Section 10.4.3. 
These analyses are considered exploratory for the  following reasons : 
 To formally conclude mediation  in the most rigorous sense , two additional criteria must 
be met in addition to those described above : (1) there can be no measurement error in 
the mediator variable M j (2) Y cannot cause M j. In this study measurement error is 
present in M j, the change in abundance of the jth bacterial taxon pre to post -TIPS. In 
addition, the pre to post -TIPS change in PHES could potentially cause changes in the GI 
tract microbiome, for example in patients prescribed rifaxim in therapy due to overt post -
TIPS HE.  
 In mediation analysis, sample sizes of [ADDRESS_1041893] large 
effects, and medium size effects may require 100 patients (45). Therefore, the present 
study may lack power to det ect medium size or small mediation effects.  
 Because microbiome mediation analysis utilizes relative abundances of bacterial taxa at 
the family and genus level s (43) a multiple testing correction is required as described 
above. The necessity for multiple testing correction further reduces statistical power . 
10.[ADDRESS_1041894] -TIPS change in PHES compared between the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760822]. Compared to pre -TIPS, patients perform approximately 18%, 51%, 26%, and 48% 
worse post -TIPS on the number connection A/B, digit symbo l, and block design tests, 
respectively  (46). Assuming a similar degree of PHES  worsening pre - versus post -TIPS among 
the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760773], but that cessation of PPIs would improve HE such that test 
performance is unchanged in the discontinuation  arm, the e stimated power with 20 patients in 
each arm (40 patients total) would be 71% to 96%. The  proposed sample size and study 
duration are commensurate with previous studies. For example, previous clinical trials of 
lactulose and rifaximin for minimal HE randomi zed 61 patients for 12 weeks (47) and 42 patients 
for 8 weeks (48). Approximately 30 patients undergo elective TIPS creation per year at Duke 
University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], with approximately 60 -75% of those taking PPIs. Thus, approximately 20 
patients per year are expected t o be eligible for the study.   
10.6 Measures to Minimize Bias  
10.6.1  Enrollment/Randomization/Masking Procedures  
Randomization codes will be generated and maintained by [CONTACT_978]. Randomization of subjects 
between the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_760823] s will be performed in a 1:1 fashion. The 
patient and treating IR physician will not be blinded (open -label design). The CRC performing 
MHE assessments via PHES tests and QOL assessments via the CLDQ and QOLRAD surveys 
will be blinded to patient assignment .

Not applicable.  
10.6.3  Breaking the Study Blind/Participant Code  
Not applicable.  
11 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents  
Source data will include CRFs and the electronic medical record. CRFs will incl ude Duke 
medical record number, a study subject identifier, PHES test results, QOL survey results, and 
patients’ reported use of on -demand histamine H2 blockers and PPIs. Raw source data and 
post-processed data from stool microbiome sequencing will be main tained in the Duke 
Protected Analytics Computing Environment ( PACE ).  
12 Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
Quality control procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry into CRFs. Any 
missing data or data anomalies will be reviewed by [CONTACT_3433] e PI [INVESTIGATOR_760824]/resolution. The study team will provide direct access to all trial related

study personnel, on non -secured or non -Duke University Health System computers.   
14.2 Study Records R etention  
Study documents will be retained for a minimum of 6 years following completion of the study in 
accordance with IRB regulations.  
14.3 Protocol Deviations  
34 
 A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol. The noncompliance 
may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study team. As a result of 
deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
These practices are consistent with ICH:  
● 4.5 Compliance with Protocol , sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
● 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
● 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
It is the responsibility of the study team to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations within 10 working days of identification of the protocol deviation. Protocol deviations 
will be sent to the local IRB per their guidelines.  
14.4 Publication and Data Sharing  
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted 
a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. In addition, in accordance of with 
Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 which mandates that a "responsible 
party" (i.e., the PI) register and report results of certain "ap plicable clinical trials" (including trials 
of drugs and biologics: controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase I investigations,  of a 
product subject to FDA regulation), the trial will be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and results 
reported.

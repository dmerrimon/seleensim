Study Abstract  
This study seeks to evaluate the prevalence and characterize predictors of physician burnout 
within anesthesia residency.  A cross -sectional evaluation of bu rnout via the Maslach burnout 
inventory, perceived stress via the Perceived Stress Scale, average sleep propensity via the 
Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50526], social support and copi[INVESTIGATOR_595713], and demographic and  professional data will be collected from all four 
years of Vanderbilt Anesthesia residents. Maslach burnout inventory scores can be assessed 
within each residency class to determine the prevalence of burnout and whether year in training, 
stress, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] s, personal support or copi[INVESTIGATOR_595714] a role in burnout scores.  
 
Additionally, the study seeks to evaluate the effect of an exercise intervention on burnout and 
personal resiliency (i.e., less individual stress given the same workload). This will b e 
accomplished by [CONTACT_595728]  (in the intern, CA -1, and CA -2 
classes)  to 8 weeks of an exercise intervention (15 min of activity at 70% of max heart rate or 
higher, 5 days a week) to meet the activity recommendations of the Of fice of Disease Prevention 
and Health Promotion or 8 weeks of continuing their baseline activity level prior to the study. 
Progress will be tracked using wearable  activity trackers to monitor heart rate, activity, sleep, 
and distance measures. Weekly surve ys will be sent to assess work hours, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_595715]. Monthly surveys will evaluate number of weekend days worked/month, workload 
assessments, Maslach burnout invento ry, Perceived stress scale, and Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] . 
We will access ins titutional work hours and clinical assignment logs to validate the self -reported 
work schedules.  
 
Specific Aims and Hypothesis  
 
Specific Aims  
1. Characterize predictors  of burnout in anesthesia residency in the intern, CA -1, CA -[ADDRESS_786392] of an exercise intervention on burnout and personal resiliency (i.e., less 
individual stress given the same workload).  
Effects of exercise on burnout in anesthesia residents  Sandy An, MD  
 [ADDRESS_786393] nationwide survey of 7 ,288 US physicians showed that approximately 45% experienced 
at least 1 symptom of burnout and this was more prevalent compared to US workers in other 
fields. Subsequently, Shanafelt et al showed that prevalence  of burnout among US physicians 
increase d to greater than 50% in 2014.1  
 
Many factors play a role in the development of burnout.2 Sinsky et al reported in a nationwide 
survey across specialties that 20% of responding physicians planned to reduce their clinical 
hours within the next year and another 26% planned on leaving their current clinical practice 
within the next 2 years.3 Burnout and the associated physician turnover is expensive for society; 
it typi[INVESTIGATOR_64549] 2 -3 times a physician’s annual salary to replace tha t physician.[ADDRESS_786394] 8  years  after 
college graduation  to train an anesthesiologis t (4 years of medical school and 4 of residency) 
plus any additional subspecialty fellowship training. The incidence of burnout among physicians 
in training is variable, but has been previously been estimated at 45%.[ADDRESS_786395] for measuring job burnout in persons working in human services and health 
care is the Maslach Burnout Inventory –Human Services Survey (MBI –HSS).6 The MBI –HSS 
consists of 22 questions in complete sentences that are specifically geared for subjects who work 
in human service professions. In a prior study by  [CONTACT_27156], Hyman et al used the Maslach 
Burnout Inventory to demonstrate a higher rate of burnout in perioperative physicians (i.e., 
surgeons and anesthesiologists) compared to nurse anesthetists and OR nurses. After adjusting 
for sex and age, residents s cored significantly higher than other physicians in the MBI -HSS 
global score (1.12 [0.43 -1.82, 95% confidence interval]), Emotional Exhaustion (EE) (1.54 
[0.44 -2.60]), and Depersonalization  (DP) (1.09 [0.23 -1.95]). The observed difference ( 0.74 [1.59 
- -0.11]) in Lack  of Personal Accomplishment (LPA) did not attain statistical significance. 
Compared with non -physicians, residents were at least a full unit higher on all items (P < 0.05 in 
all cases). Residents had better health (1.49 [0.48 -2.50]) and higher workload (1.23 [0.07 -2.40]) 
compared with attending physicians.[ADDRESS_786396] s’ 
burnout, copi[INVESTIGATOR_595716], conduct ed via an online survey associated with a 
Effects of exercise on burnout in anesthesia residents  Sandy An, MD  
 [ADDRESS_786397] study (mean EE 3.5 vs. 3.3, DP 1.5 vs. 2.0, and LPA 2.3 vs. 1.5, 
respectively).[ADDRESS_786398] promising results. Bretland et al 
showed exercise (cardiovascular or resistance training) in previously inactive participants led to 
increased well -being, decreased psychological distress, perceived stress, and emotional 
exhaustion with large effect sizes despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a small sample size (n = 49 total, n  = 20 controls, n  = 
20 cardiovascular training, n  = 9 resistance training ).12 Weight et al showed that a 12 -week 
incentivized exercise program directed at the residents and fellows (n = 628) across all 
disciplines increased physical a ctivity and improved quality of life scores. Participants had lower 
burnout scores compared to non -participants, but the difference s were  not statistically 
significant.13 However,  exercise program was self -directed and self -reported. Only 51% of the 
participants (n=89) reported at least 75 min of vigorous exercise per week compared to 25% of 
non-participants (n=88). Additionally, rather than measuring burnout with the MBI, Weight et al 
measured burnout with 2 questions adapted from the MBI scor ed on a 7 -point Likert scale.    
 
To enhance overall health, the U.S. government Office of Disease Prevention and Health 
promotion recommends an average of 150 min of moderate intensity exercise (brisk walking or 
tennis) weekly or 75 minutes of vigorous in tensity physical activity (jogging or swimming 
laps).[ADDRESS_786399] 10 -minute 
intervals.  
 
If consistently participating in such an exercise regimen can be shown to improve personal 
resiliency and decrease burnout in resident physicians, such an intervention  could improve 
resident performance and morale, reduce departmental and /or institutional costs, and enhance 
retention. By [CONTACT_595729], young physicians could  continue to build personal 
resilience to decrease the prevalence of burnout throughout their careers. Additionally, if this 
study ’s results are positive, a n exercise intervention could then be studied in other anesthesia 
professionals (i.e., faculty and CRNA) and across the medical profession more generally.

Research Design and Methods  
 
This study  consists of  two components:  
1. A cross -sectional survey of the prevalence of burnout among anesthesia residents to identify 
potential predictors of burnout  
2. An order -randomized, [ADDRESS_786400] crossover study evaluating whether a n 
exercise intervention will improve personal resiliency and decrease burnout i n the resident 
physician.  
 
The cross -sectional baseline survey  will include all consenting Vanderbilt anesthesia residents 
(interns, CA1, CA2, and CA3s). We will send a REDCap survey that contains questions 
regarding demographic information (age, gender, level of training, etc), activity level (current 
physical activity, minutes/week, etc), sleep propensity (Epworth sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50526]), stress 
(Perceived Stress Scale), and burnout (Maslach burnout Inventory) . The goal will be to include 
all [ADDRESS_786401] 3 years  (intern, CA1, 
and CA2) . They will be invited to participate in a 16 -week study in which each resident will be 
randomized to e ither an exercise intervention or usual activity (i.e., control) for the first 8 weeks.  
Then, in the second 8 -week block, the participants will be in the opposite condition (i.e., control 
or the exercise intervention, respectively).  We will create a random ly-generated, balanced 
allocation table and enter participants sequentially from a blinded list as they are enrolled.  
 
A total of 55 residents are eligible for the study . The goal will be to enroll ~ 50 anesthesiology 
residents into the interventional study ; [ADDRESS_786402] three classes (i.e., 
intern, CA 1 and CA2). We anticipate that about 10 -15% will  not successfully complete the 
study , yielding a desired accrual of ~43 residents (~14 per class) with complete data . 
 
The exclusion  criteria for the interventional study will be the following:  
o Failure to sign informed consent  
o Will not be in town and available for the full duration of the study (e.g., 2 or more weeks of 
vacation or absence )  
o Physical inability to perform the exercise i ntervention (including health indications)  
 
At study enrollment, all participants will complete the same REDCap survey as mentioned in the 
cross -sectional component of the study (see supplemental materials for all questions). Each 
person will receive a wearable  activity tracker that automatically continuously collects heart rate, 
sleep, and activity (number of steps, calories burned, etc .). If the participant already has a smart 
watch, they will be asked to either also wear the study wearable  activity track er or instead wear it 
during the study period (note that depending on the type of smart watch they already use, we 
may be able to use that for the study instead of our specified study device). Participants will be 
expected to wear their wearable  activity t racker  at all times for the duration of the study except 
when it needs to be charged ( for about 2 hours once every 4 -5 days) or if they are swimming or 
showering.

allow the PI [INVESTIGATOR_595718].  Additionally, height and weight measurements will be obtained at this 
time as well.  
 
The intervention will be a [ADDRESS_786404] 5 days each week, in addition to (i.e. 
independent of) any exercise in which the participant regularly engages. During the [ADDRESS_786405]  
70% of their maximum heart rate (70% of (220 – age)) – this is also known as the “cardio zone” 
as depi[INVESTIGATOR_595719] .

The wearable  activity tracker  provide s a reliable method of tracking adherence to the exercise 
intervention; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_595720] 15-minutes of  
sustained heart rate s of greater than or equal to 70% of the participant’s maximum heart rate. 
Each participant will be given several equivalent exercise options to assure that they have clear 
guidance as to how to attain the ir personal  heart rate goals regardless of their clinical 
assignments and daily workload .  
 
Examples of possible 15 -minute exercise  regimens to be used  by [CONTACT_595730]:  
o Walking quickly or running up and down stairs  (e.g., in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595721])  
o Plyometric exercises such as jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_54817], high knees, squats, lunges, speed skaters, 
froggers, etc.  
Effects of exercise on burnout in anesthesia residents  Sandy An, MD  
 6 o Walking up an incline on a treadmill  
o Jogging or running on a treadmill or elliptical  
o Stationary cycling or rowing  
 
At the end of each week of the study, participants will be prompted via email or text to complete 
a short  online  questionnaire (via REDCap) regarding their current rotation, hours worked over 
the past week, and self -assessments of stress and fatigue over the past week. If a survey is not 
completed within 2 4 hours , a reminder email  or text  will be sent to the participant. Wearable  
activity tracker  data will also be captured and evaluated each week  to confirm adherence to the 
protocol and to troubleshoot any issues related to the activity tracker.  
 
At the end of each 4-week block (i.e. at the end of each monthly clinical rotation), participants 
will be prompted  to complete an online REDCap survey containing the weekly survey data as 
well as a MBI -HSS, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50526], and number of 
weekend days  worked (in house or home call).  This will yield 5 sets of scores per participant 
(baseline plus [ADDRESS_786406] -rotation samples) . As with the weekly REDCap surveys, if a  survey is not 
completed within 2 4 hours , a reminder email or text w ill be sent  to the participant.  
 
At the end of each 8-week block, participants’ weight will be obtained.  
 
At the completion of the study, the number of weekends worked will be extracted from  
OpenTempo . Additionally, all participants will be asked in the terminal REDCap survey if they 
intend to continue an exercise regimen after the study based on their experience during the study.

The following scales will be used in this study .  
1. Maslach Burnout Inventory – Human Services Study  (MBI -HSS)  is the gold standard for 
measuring job burnout in persons working in human services and health care.7 The MBI -HSS 
consists of 22 questions in complete sentences scored on a 7 -point Likert scale that are 
Effects of exercise on burnout in anesthesia residents  Sandy An, MD  
 7 specifically geared for subjects who work in human service professions.  The MBI -HSS will 
be administered every 4 weeks for total of 5 set of scores per participant.  
2. “Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for 
measuring the perception of stress. ”[ADDRESS_786407] been associated with failure to quit smoking, controlling blood 
glucose levels in diabetics, etc. The questions are geared to assessing an individual’s feelings 
over the past month. The PSS will be administered every [ADDRESS_786408] questionnaire (FIQ) 
and has been shown to be valid as an endpoint measure in Fibromyalgia clinical trials.17 
Similarly, a unidimensional 0 -100-point scale will be used assess fatigue and stress  on a 
weekly basis.  
4. Social suppo rt and personal copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (SSPC -14): The SSPC -14 was developed by [CONTACT_595731]’s copi[INVESTIGATOR_595722].[ADDRESS_786409]  
questions, a higher score represents better copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/ support.  
5. Epworth sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50526] (ESS): The ESS is an 8 -question survey scored on a 4 -point Likert 
scale designed to assess average sleep propensity. The scale does not specify a recall period, 
but is instead intended to cover a time span of weeks – months rather than a few hours or 
days.18  
 
Risks to participants  
 
The r isks to participants are minimal.  All participant s’ study  data will be de-identified, to the 
extent possible,  after data collection to protect  participant confidentiality  and privacy . Identi fying 
information will be maintained in a separat e database from the study data.  
 
For the cross -sectional survey , there are minimal risks to participants as all data will be de -
identified. For the interventional part of the study, they will be asked to pa rticipate in 
cardiovascular activity that will maintain their heart rate at 70% of their max heart rate (220 -age) 
for 15 minutes, 5 times a week. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_595723] . If the participant is unable  to do this safely, they will be excluded from the study.  
The intended participants are generally healthy individuals who will be  able to participate in 
cardiovascular activity and maintain a heart rate of greater than 70% of their maximum heart rate 
for 1 5 minutes or greater. This amount of activity is recommended by [CONTACT_941] U.S. government 
Office of Disease Prevention and Health promotion.  
 
Data and safety monitoring plan:  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_595724]. To ensure 
participants' safety and data integrity, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_595725] (e.g. at least once a month, if not more frequently) to review and 
discuss the data and any potential issues or challenges related to the study.

Adverse Events  
 
Adverse research events (i.e., those affecting subject or others due to the conduct of this 
research), should they occur , will be immediately reported, as appropriate, to Occupational 
Health and the IRB.  
 
Statistical Analysis and Power:  
 
Aim 1 : The degree of burnout among residents will be quantified using baseline MBI 
measurements. Summaries of the total MBI score and each  component score will be made using 
the median and inter -quartile range, and these summaries will be stratified according to baseline 
demographics and other characteristics (e.g., residency class). We will then use multiple 
regression methods to quantify t he adjusted associations between these factors and the total and 
component MBI scores. In regression analyses, all quantitative covariates will be modeled using 
restricted cubic splines with up to four knots. Multiple -degree -of-freedom tests will be used t o 
quantify the variability explained by [CONTACT_595732]. In the absence of strong evidence of 
nonlinearity, these terms will be excluded from the model. No interactions will be considered. 
Model assumptions will be checked using graphical and quantitative regression diagnostics, and 
alternative model formulations or data transformations will be considered as necessary. The 
adjusted associations between covariates and outcomes will be summarized using an estimate, 
95% confidence interval, and Wald -type signi ficance test at the 5% level. For quantitative 
covariates with nonlinear associations, graphical methods will be used to summarize these 
associations.  
  
Aim 2 : The effect of intervention on the change in the degree of burnout across study phases (as 
measur ed by [CONTACT_595733]) and other outcomes will be quantified 
using mixed -effects regression methods. For these analyses, we will use the difference scores as 
the primary outcome (e.g., MBI post – MBI pre), such that each participant  will contribute two 
outcome measurements. These measurements will be regressed onto the treatment/control 
indicator variable, the indicator for crossover order (i.e., 0 if control -then-treatment, 1 if 
treatment -then-control), as well as baseline covariate s, which will be modeled in a manner 
similar to that described for the Aim [ADDRESS_786410] of interventio n will be quantified using an estimate, 95% confidence 
interval, and Wald -type significance test at the 5% level.  
 
For all primary analyses, we will adhere to intent -to-treat principles. Thus, all available data will 
be used in primary analyses regardless  of participant dropout or adherence to study protocols. 
We will conduct two sets of secondary analyses, including per -protocol analysis using only those 
participant records that were in compliance with the study protocol, and by [CONTACT_595734] /control indicator variable for a variable that quantifies the total amount of exercise 
time associated with the study intervention.  
 
Effects of exercise on burnout in anesthesia residents  Sandy An, MD  
 9 In the event that substantial missingness (>10%) occurs in one or more covariates, we will use 
the chained -equations multi ple imputation method, and Rubin’s rules to account for this added 
uncertainty . 
The statistical power associated with the Aim [ADDRESS_786411] deviation is approximately 7 points, 
which is roughly half of the between -participa nts variability observed in previous studies. Under 
these assumptions, the proposed study size of 40 participants renders 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_786412] size equates to 
a 10% change  in the typi[INVESTIGATOR_595726].  
 
Participant Incentives and Inducements  
 
Participants in the interventional study will be compensated for their time and effort. All 
residents who complete the study will receive  a $[ADDRESS_786413] upon  their successful completion of 
each  8-week block ($50 total per participant) . In addition , each resident who completes the entire 
study successfully  will be entered into a raffle for a $[ADDRESS_786414] organized by [CONTACT_595735] 
(one each for the intern, CA -1, and CA -2 class es). Based on prior studies involving anesthesia 
resident participants, this level of compensation should be sufficien t to induce enrollment and 
on-going active participation without being coercive.  
 
The study will have a website to permit the investigators to disseminate information to 
participants, to support participants’ issues and concerns, and to enhance participant adherence to 
the data collection and exercise intervention regimens. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_595727] ‘on track’ , to assure capture of data from their 
wearable activity monitor, and  to answer any  questions or address any concerns. All interaction 
with the study and its personnel will be compl etely vol untary and escapable. T he study will not 
affect the  residents’ patient care duties or their standing in the training program.  
 
Timeline  
 
After receiving IRB approval, participants will be consented and enrolled. Stu dy set -up will 
occur in the two weeks prior to the first study rotation. Set up will include collection of baseline 
data, distributing and configuring the wearable  activity tracker s and associated apps, and 
establishing each participant ’s preferred exercise regimen. Each participant’s d ata collection will 
then occur over the next 16 weeks. Data analysis and manuscript preparation is expected require 
an additional 12 weeks.  
 
Dissemination Plan  
 
The results of the study will be presented at a national conference (most likely at IARS or ASA  
depending on timing). A peer -reviewed journal publication will contain the primary outcome 
data (i.e., changes in the Maslach burnout inventory scores with and without the exercise 
intervention). It is anticipated that this manuscript will be prepared and  ready for publication 
during the summer of 2018.

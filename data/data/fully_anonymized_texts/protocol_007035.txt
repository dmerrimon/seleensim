2) An  automatic settings initializer and adaptation system running on the server Type of Study Prospective, Single Arm, Single Center Feasibility Study Rational The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary safety and performance data on a settings initialization and adaptation 
algorithm used in conjunction with closed-loop control. Based on 
data from simulations and current system use, an algorithm to 
more accurately initialize settings and adapt them over time, faster 
than typi[INVESTIGATOR_595055], would benefit users onboarding from 
multiple daily injections ( MDI ) and help them reach optimal 
glycemic outcomes faster. Outcomes of this s tudy will allow for 
the determination of an optimal product configuration for adaptive 
settings and the ability to clinically test a commercial version of the new product for effectiveness. Objectives Primary objective: To demonstrate the safety of the system, by [CONTACT_595063] (needing 
assistance) compared to expected incidence  
 
Secondary objective : Compare time in range metrics and adverse 
events in the full 24 hour period, overnight and during the day, 
after each we ek of settings adaptation. The number of physician 
overrides/physician initiated changes in pump settings will also be tracked. Primary Endpoints 1) Primary Endpoint: a. To demonstrate the safety of the system, by [CONTACT_595064] s evere hypoglycemic events  (needing 
assistance)  compared to expected incidence  
2) Secondary Endpoints: 
a. Time in range 70-180 mg/dL 
b. Time < 54 mg/dL 
c. Time < 70 mg/dL 
d. Time > 180 mg/dL 
e. Time > 250 mg/dL

Patient Reported Outcomes Duration of Study Up to 17 weeks total, to allow for 2 to 4 weeks of CGM run-in if needed, then 13 weeks of pump/AID use with weekly settings adaptation Study Design $GXOWVDJH\HDUVRIDJHZLWKW\SHGLDEHWHVZKRDUHusing multiple daily injections, will be required to collect baseline CGM 
data for the first [ADDRESS_785525] 11 of 14 days of CGM use for the 14 days prior to 
enrollment.  They may repeat this 14 day run-in period if adequate 
CGM data is not collected, or study staff feel it is necessary to 
continue to monitor their insulin dose. 
 
Subjects will then proceed to pump/Control- IQ training , where an 
algorithm performed on a paper worksheet will be used to 
recommend initial basal rate , carbohydrate ratio and correction 
factor  settings .  
 
Subjects will then wear the insulin pump with Control- IQ 
technology active for 13 weeks, and at day 3 and at the end of 
each week will:  
1) Upload their pump using the USB uploader  
2) Have their study physician review the settings 
recommendations on the pump download report that will 
appear after each download.  
3) Change their settings after being called by [CONTACT_595065]. 
4) Upload their pump again so the study physician can verify 
the settings have been changed  appropriately , and verify 
the correct settings have been applied to the correct pump 
assigned to the subject by [CONTACT_595066] t:connect. 
5) Physicians can at any time adjust pump settings  and 
override the settings adaptation recommendations for 
safety concerns , and convert scheduled phone follow-up 
visits to in clinic visit at their discretion.  
 
A semi -structured one-on- one interview may be completed 
concurrent with the 13- Week Visit or within a [ADDRESS_785526] approximately 30 
minutes and will be conducted by [CONTACT_468513] a script of open-ended questions to gather feedback and reactions to the Page B9

4.1 DISEASE BACKGROUND  128 
Type 1 diabetes affects 1.25 million people in the [LOCATION_002]. Approximately 70% of 129 
individuals with type 1 diabetes report poor metabolic control, and do not meet the American 130 
Diabetes Association’s recommended goal of hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) level of 7.0% for children [ADDRESS_785531] that approximately 40 0,000 U.S. patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) 134 
use insulin pumps. Adoption of pump therapy varies by [CONTACT_595069] 135 
healthcare provider preference or patient characteristics and socioeconomic status. Use of insulin 136 
pumps is more common in individuals of higher socioeconomic status as reflected by 137 
race/ethnicity, private health insurance, family income, and education. Additionally, referrals 138 
from healthcare providers and insurance approvals are c ritical determinants for who becomes a 139 
pump us er in the [LOCATION_002].  140 
However, a main barrier to starting pump therapy and staying on it is having to enter insulin 141 
delivery settings into the pump (ie basa l rate, carbohydrate ratio, correction factor) and [ADDRESS_785532] the safety and feasibility  of 143 
using a settings initializer for individuals onboarding to the t:slim X2 pump with Control- IQ 144 
technology, with weekly adaptations of insulin delivery settings over ~13 weeks.  145 
4.2 DEVICE BACKGROUND  146 
The t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control -IQ technology is an advanced hybrid closed-loop 147 
(HCL) system, developed and manufactured by [CONTACT_3438], Inc. and cleared in the 148 
U.S. by [CONTACT_3439] 1 diabetes. Control- IQ is integrated with the Dexcom 149 
G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and uses CGM values to predict glucose values 30 150 
minutes in the future. Based on the predicted glucose, Control-IQ modulates basal insulin 151 
delivery, and delivers automated correction boluses to mitigate impending hyperglycemia. The 152 
current Control- IQ system is F DA approved down to age 6 years old for individuals with type 1 153 
diabetes, and has been found to improve time in range (70-180 mg/dL) and decrease both time < 154 
70 mg/dL and time >180 mg/dL (1,2). 155 
4.3 SETTINGS O PTIMIZER  156 
For this study, insulin delivery settings i nitialization will use a paper worksheet (Figure 1) to 157 
guide initial settings .  158

Figure 1. Insulin pump initiation settings worksheet 162 
Adaptation will be recommended by [CONTACT_595070], emailing written recommendations 163 
for settings changes to physicians for their review. The automated settings adaptation system will 164 
recommend a single basal rate, carbohydrate ratio and correction factor throughout the day 165 
(Figure 2) , and will limit recommendations to a maximum 5% change at a time.  166

8.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  416 
This feasibility study is a prospective, single arm study, evaluating al algorithm to recommend 417 
insulin pump settings at pump start (initialization) and then weekly for 13 weeks. 418 
Descriptive statistics of the rates of severe hypoglycemia, DKA, and serious adverse events will 419 
be reported for baseline (with CGM run -in data) and compared to changes after each weekly 420 
adap tation. Additionally, descriptive statistics of glycemic outcomes will for baseline and each 421 
intervention configuration will be provided.  422 
The statistics will include  all primary and secondary outcomes of the study as listed in section 423 
5.3. These statistics will be calculated at the patient -level, and a sub-analysis of daytime vs. 424 
nighttime statistics will be provided.  425

9.1 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THE DEVICE  429 
Risks and Benefits are detailed below. Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk; however, data 430 
are handled to minimize this risk. Hypoglycemia, hyp erglycemia and ketone formation are 431 
always a risk in participants with diabetes  and participants will be monitored for this. 432 
9.2 VENIPUNCTURE RISKS  433 
A hollow needle/plastic tube may be placed in the arm for taking blood samples . Blood draws 434 
can cause some commo n reactions like pain, bruising, or redness at the sampling site. Less 435 
common reactions include bleeding from the sampling site, formation of a small blood clot or 436 
swelling of the vein and surrounding tissues, and fainting. 437 
9.3 FINGERSTICK RISKS  438 
About 1 drop of blood will be removed by [CONTACT_595077] 439 
sometimes Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) or other tests. This is a standard method used to obtain [ADDRESS_785560] for several weeks. The risk of local infection is less than 1 in 1000. This should not be a 443 
significant contributor to risks in this study as fingerstick s are part of the usual care for people 444 
with diabetes.  445 
9.4 SUBCUTANEOUS CATHETER RISKS (CGM)  446 
With CGM use participants are at low risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin infection at the site of the 447 
sensor needle placement. If a catheter is left under the skin for more than 24 hours, it is possible 448 
to get an infection where it goes into the skin, with swelling, redness and pain. There may be 449 
bleeding where the catheter is put in and bleeding under the skin causes a bruise (1 in 10 risk). [ADDRESS_785561] a small portion of the sensor probe under the 451 
skin that may cause redness, swelling or pain at the insertion site. The participant will be 452 
instructed to notify the study coordinator immediately if this occurs. 453 
9.5 RISK OF HYPOGLYCEMIA  454 
As with any person having diabetes  and using insulin, there is always a risk of having a low 455 
blood sugar (hypoglycemia). The frequency of hypoglycemia should be no more and possibly [ADDRESS_785562] as at home, there is the possibility of fainting or seizures 458 
(convulsions) and that for a few days the participant may not be as aware of symptoms of 459 
hypoglycemia. A CGM functioning poorly and significantly over-reading glucose values could 460 
lead to inappropriate insulin delivery. 461 
Page B26

   Contains trade secrets and/or confidential information exempt fr om disclosure from [ADDRESS_785563] strips, and a ketone 466 
meter and ketone strips to use to carefully monitor for hyperglycemia and be given instructions 467 
on how to mitigate hyperglycemia should it occur. 468 
9.7 RISK OF DEVICE REUSE  469 
All devices will be used by a single study participant only. There will be no device re- use. 470 
9.8 OTHER RISKS  471 
Some par ticipants may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives used to secure 472 
the CGM, or from tape to secure the insulin infusion sets for the continuous subcutaneous insulin 473 
infusion.  If these reactions occur, different adhesives or “under-tapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” (such as with IV 3000, 474 
Tegaderm, etc.) will be tried, sites will be rotated frequently, and a mild topi[INVESTIGATOR_3406] 475 
other medication may be required.  476 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an infection. The CGM and pump infusion 477 
sites are inserted under the skin. It is possible that any part that is inserted under the skin may 478 
cause an infection. These occur very infrequently, but, if an infection was to occur, oral and/or [ADDRESS_785564]’s home pump will include data from prior to the date of the screening visit. 485 
Some people may  be uncomfortable with the researchers' having such detailed information about 486 
their daily diabetes habits. 487 
9.9 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  488 
Participants may experience a significant improvement in glucose control. Hypoglycemia is the 489 
number one fear of many individuals taking insulin and this fear often prevents o ptimal glycemic 490 
control. Hyperglycemia will likely be reduced as well.  491 
It is expected that this protocol will yield increased knowledge about using an automated 492 
closed -loop to control glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes. The individual participant 493 
may or may not benefit from study participation. 494 
9.10 RISK ASSESSMENT  495 
Based on the facts that (1) adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes experience mild 496 
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia frequently as a consequence of the disease and its 497 
management, (2) th e study intervention involves periodic automated insulin dosing that may 498 Page B27
   Confidential     
   Contains trade secrets and/or confidential information exempt fr om disclosure from 21 CFR 20.61  increase the likelihood of hypoglycemia, and periodic automated attenuation of insulin delivery 499 
that may increase the likelihood of hyperglycemia, (3) mitigations are in place, and have been 500 
tested in prior studies using the investigational device system in the home setting, that limit the 501 
likelihood of excessive insulin dosing or prolonged withdrawal of insulin, (4) rapid reversal of 502 
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can be achieved, and (5) the Control algorithm (Control- IQ) is 503 
already FDA approved for and has shown significant (10+%) TIR improvements in individuals [ADDRESS_785565] their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, with 511 
the protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 512

RULES 581 
11.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  582 
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a  study participant, irrespective of the 583 
relationship between the adverse event and the device(s) under investigation (see section 11.2 for 584 
reportable adverse events for this protocol). 585 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any untoward medical occurrence that: 586 
Results in death. 587 
Is life -threatening; (a non- life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 588 
become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event). 589

Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to [ADDRESS_785573] normal life functions (sight threatening). [ADDRESS_785574]. 593 
Is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] (e.g., 594 
may jeopardize the participant or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the 595 
outcomes listed above).  [ADDRESS_785575] (UADE):  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or [ADDRESS_785576], 598 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 599 
investigati onal plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other 600 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 601 
welfare of participants (21 CFR 812.3(s)). [ADDRESS_785577] (ADE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant which [ADDRESS_785578] contributed (Note that an Adverse 604 
Event Form is to be completed in addition to a Device Deficiency or Issue Form). 605 
Device Complaints and Malfunctions: A device complication or complaint is something that 606 
happens to a device or related to device performance, whereas an adverse event happens to a 607 
participant. A device complaint may occur independently from an AE, or along with an AE. 608 
An AE may occur without a device complaint or there may be an AE related to a device 609 
complaint. A device malfunction is any failure of a device to meet its performance specifications 610 
or otherwise perform as intended. Performance specifications include all claims made in the 611 
labeling for the device. The intended performance of a device refers to the intended use for 612 
which the device is labeled or marketed. (21 CFR 803.3). Note: for reporting purposes, sites 613 
will not be asked to distinguish between device complaints and malfunctions. 614

All reportable Adverse Events —whether volunteered by [CONTACT_2299], discovered by [CONTACT_3449] [ADDRESS_785585], or other 657 
means —will be reported on an adverse event form online. Each adverse event form is reviewed [ADDRESS_785586] be en caused 662 
by [CONTACT_19911]. 663 
To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators should apply the 664 
following general guideline when determining whether an adverse event is related: 665 
Yes 666 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and the study 667 
intervention, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical state, 668 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the adverse event follows a known pattern 669 
of respo nse to the study intervention; and/or the adverse event abates or resolves upon 670 
discontinuation of the study intervention or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon 671 
re-challenge.  672 
No 673 
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study intervention (e.g., 674 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 675 
medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to study 676 
intervention. 677 
11.6 INTENSITY OF ADVERSE EVENT  678 
The inten sity of an adverse event will be rated on a three point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or 679 
(3) severe. It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus a severe adverse 680 
event is not necessarily serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but 681 
may not be clinically serious. 682 Page B33
   Confidential     
   Contains trade secrets and/or confidential information exempt fr om disclosure from 21 CFR 20.61  MILD: Usually transient, requires no special treatment, and does not interfere with the participant’s 683 
daily activities.  684 
MODERATE: Usually causes a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may interfere 685 
with daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  686 
SEVERE: Interrupts a participant’s usual daily activities and generally requires systemic drug therapy or 687 
other treatment.  688 
11.7 CODING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  689 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. T he investigator’s assessment will 690 
be recorded.  691 
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study 692 
will be followed until their medical o utcome is determined or until no further change in the 693

11.8 OUTCOME OF ADVERSE EVENT  695 
The outcome of each reportable adverse event will be classified by [CONTACT_3470]: 696 
RECOVERED/RESOLVED – The participant recovered from the AE/SAE without sequelae. [ADDRESS_785587] the AE/SAE stop date.  698 
RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE – The event persisted and had stabilized [ADDRESS_785588] the AE/SAE stop date. 700 
FATAL – A fatal outcome is defined as the SAE that resulted  in death. Only the event that was 701 
the cause of death should be reported as fatal. AEs/SAEs that were ongoing at the time of death; 702 
however, were not the cause of death, will be recorded as “resolved” at the time of death.  703 
NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED (ONGOING) – An ongoing AE/SAE is defined as the 704 
event was ongoing with an undetermined outcome. 705 
An ongoing outcome will require follow-up by [CONTACT_595078] 706 
the AE/SAE.  707 
The outcome of an ongoing event at the time of death that was not the cause of death, will be 708 
updated and recorded as “resolved” with the date of death recorded as the stop date.  709 
UNKNOWN – An unknown outcome is defined as an inability to access the participant or the 710 
participant’s records to determine the outcom e (for example, a participant that was lost to follow - 711 
up). 712 
All clinically significant abnormalities of clinical laboratory measurements or adverse events  713 
occurring during the study and continuing at study termination should be followed by [CONTACT_941] 714 
participant’s  physician and evaluated with additional tests (if necessary) until diagnosis of the 715 
underlying cause, or resolution. Follow-up information should be recorded on source documents. 716

 1. Background and Rationale  
 
The prescribing of inappropriate medications for older adults is extremely common in the 
[LOCATION_002], ranging from 12% in community settings to 40% of those who are institutionalized.1-[ADDRESS_986508] commonly 
prescribed in circumstances that are inconsistent with practice guidelines.3,4 While inappropriate 
prescribing increases the risk of adverse health consequences for all patients, older adults are 
particularly vulnerable.2,5-7 Physicians’ lack of awareness of alternatives, ambiguous practice 
guidelines, and perceived pressure of patients or caregivers are among the reasons why these 
drugs are used more than might be optimal.[ADDRESS_986509] (EHR) systems. While EHR strategies 
are widely used to support the informational needs of providers, these tools have demonstrated 
only modest effectiveness at improving pr escribing.8-[ADDRESS_986510] also 
been criticized for the sheer volume of alerts, the lack of clinical significance of the tools, and the 
poor/delayed timing of the clinical decision support (i.e., after the prescribing decision). 
Accordingly , the effectiveness of these tools could be enhanced by [CONTACT_722316] -gained 
insights from behavioral economics and other related sciences. Their application to EHRs has 
been limited, and they have not been used to reduce the prescribing of potentially harmful 
medications to older adults.  
 
2. Study Aims  
The overall goal of the proposed research is to evaluate whether EHR -based tools , 
optimized using behavioral science principles , reduce inappropriate prescribing among older 
adults. Our overall hypothesis is that thoughtful incorporation of behavioral principles into 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986511] EHR tools 
or usual care .  Composite of 1) discontinuation 
of high -risk medications 
(benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], sedative 
hypnotics, or anticholinergicsor 
2) ordering a gradual dose 
taper for one of these 
medications  These outcomes are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_722304].  
Secondary  
To examine whether behavioral 
science -based EHR tools 
reduce cumulative prescribing 
of high -risk medications in 
older adults compared with 
usual care .  Quantity of high -risk medication 
prescribed , defined by [CONTACT_722317][INVESTIGATOR_722305] -risk 
medications prescribed to 
patients in follow -up  These outcomes capture the extent to 
which high -risk medications are 
cumulatively prescribed to patients by [CONTACT_722318] -up period.  
Tertiary/Exploratory  
To evaluate whether behavioral 
science -based EHR tools reduce 
the risk of clinically -significant 
adverse drug events, falls, 
fractures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or 
emergency room visits  
compared with usual care.  Rates of adverse drug events, 
falls, fractures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
and emergency room visits in 
follow -up; quantity of high -risk 
medications dispensed to 
patients in follow -up period  These outcomes measure clinical  
outcomes that are consequences of these 
high-risk medications, measured in medical 
and pharmacy administrative claims data.  
 
 
3. Study Design  
 
3.1 Study site 
 
The replication trial will be conducted in outpatient primary care practices at Mass 
General Brigham (MGB), specifically Mass General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . MGB has  a fully functional EHR, 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39457] ( www.epi[INVESTIGATOR_722306].com ), that supports computerized ordering of medications . MGB is 
comprised of 150 outpatient practices with over 1,800 physicians . 
 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986512] a p arallel group trial at Mass General Brigham , specifically within MGH 
primary care practices . We hypothesize that these tools will reduce prescribing of high -risk 
medications (primary outcome), cumulative prescribing  of high -risk medications (secondary 
outcome), and clinically -significant adverse drug events like sedation and confusion ( tertiary 
outcome) compared with usual care.  
3.2.1 Trial Design  
 This trial is a cluster -randomized, NIH -defined Phase III pragmatic trial. The study 
statistician, in partnership with data analysts at MGB , will generate and implement the 
randomization scheme, with oversight by [CONTACT_5844]. All the study sites will be at 
MGH for this trial ; we have received approval from leadership at MGH primary care practices and 
Digital Health eCare teams to conduct this trial . For study evaluation, data regarding patients' 
medical history, disease control, medication use , and healthcare utilization will be obtained from 
EHR data or administrative claims data. Any administrative claims data used for evaluation in this 
study will come directly from MGB  in HIPAA -limited datasets  through their risk -bearing contracts.  
  We will randomize primary care providers at MGH to one of the [ADDRESS_986513] promising treatment 
arms identified in the prior adaptive randomized trial conducted at Atrius Health or usual care  
(described in further detail in 5.2) . We expect to randomize approximately 2 00 providers.  Providers 
randomized to one of the  2 selected treatment arms will receive an EHR tool to guide their care of 
eligible patients. We will randomize providers based on provider demographic characteristics, 
patient case -mix factors, and baseline rates of high-risk medication prescribing  measured in EHR 
data.  
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986514] one older adult in the 180 days prior to randomization. Providers will 
receive these EHR tools for their patients who meet the f ollowing criteria: 1) older adults (aged 
65 years or more), and 2) who have been prescribed at least [ADDRESS_986515], would not provide the same 
degree of scientific rigor.  
 
3.5 Justification for intervention  
The focus areas for the EHR tools will be primarily drawn from the outpatient Choosing 
Wisely recommendations in geriatric medicine but are also informed by [CONTACT_722319] -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
9 
 other major clinical guidelines.16-18 In specific, we plan to focus on the following therapeutic 
classes: (1) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]; (2 ) sedative hypnotics (sleep medicines) and (3) anticholinergics. 
These classes were chosen because they all have established clinical guidelines recommending 
reductions in use, continue to be heavily over -prescribed, contribute significantly to poor clinical  
outcomes in older adults, and also have non -drug or less risky therapeutic alternatives. While 
prescribing non -drug options may be the optimal alternative to these potentially inappropriate 
medications, their adverse effects could also be attenuated by [CONTACT_722320] 
a different drug class , lower doses of medication, or alternative, safer medications within the same 
drug class.  
  We have chosen to focus on key principles of behavioral economics and cognitive 
psychology to “nudge” providers to optimize prescribing, such as  timing, salience, framing, 
simplification, pre-commitment, and boostering. These principles were selected based on their 
effectiveness in other settings19-22, their applicability to the care of older adults , and their ability to 
be adapted to the EHR context.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_986516] of the Clarity and Payer 
databases. The Clarity database is a relational database that contains clinical and  financial 
information from the Epic Suite of products; including the electronic medical record system, the 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
10 
 appointment scheduling syste m, the patient accounting system, and the master patient index 
(Identity). The various tables within the Clarity database are refreshed on a daily, weekly or 
monthly basis . At MGB, we will extract clinical information from the electronic medical record 
system via the Epic Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) or the Mass General Brigham 
Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR). Accessing the EDW in particular is necessary in order 
to adequately identify and link all eligible patients seen  by [CONTACT_722321], which is not possible using other sources.  
For the claims data, the Medicare claims data are being provided by [CONTACT_175315], the 
National Institute on Aging (NIA), through their partnership with Acumen and the established 
MedRIC  (https://www.medric.info/data -enclave/data -pages/data ). In order to obtain claims data 
from the funder, we will provide them with Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) for linked 
patients in our study.  We are executing all appropriate data use agreements with the NIA and 
Acumen  to receive these data.

 4. Study Population  
 
The study will intervene upon primary care providers ( primary care provider  designated 
physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) and their patients in the outpatient 
practices of Mass General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  
 
4.[ADDRESS_986517]. The inclusion criteria are limited to maxi mize generalizability in 
accordance with pragmatic trial principles by [CONTACT_722322] -2 (PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum 
Indicator Summary ). 
 
Providers will be eligible if they:  
• Are a primary care provider at  Mass General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , with a minim um clinical schedule  
of 2 sessions  per week  
• Prescribed a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sedative hypnotic, or anticholinergic to at least one older 
adult in the 180 days prior to randomization  
 
Patients will be included in the analysis if they:  
• Are assigned to one of the randomized primary care providers  (by [CONTACT_722323])  
• Are aged 65 years or more  
• Have been prescribed at least [ADDRESS_986518] 90 pi[INVESTIGATOR_722307] 180 
days  
 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986519] is to improve existing decision 
support  to reduce the use of potentially dangerous medications in the elderly, consistent with 
numerous professional guidelines and quality metrics.  P roviders will retain oversight of the ir 
patient s’ care  and will be able to make therapeutic choices based using their professional 
judgement . Patients will not receiv e any direct intervention as a result of their inclusion in the study .

5. Study Interventions  
5.1 Therapeutic areas  
The focus areas for the EHR tools will be primarily drawn from the outpatient Choosing 
Wisely recommendations in geriatric medicine but are also informed by [CONTACT_722324].4,23 In specific, we plan to focus on the following therapeutic 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
13 
 classes: (1) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]; (2)  sedative hypnotics (sleep medicines) and (3) 
anticholinergics.  
 
 
5.2 Study interventions  
 
Physicians in the replication trial randomized to one of the 2 active intervention arms will 
receive one of several possible enhanced EHR decision support to guide care. The type and 
timing of an alert will vary based on the intervention are outlined below. The t wo specific EHR 
tools for the replication trial at MGB was determined based on the adaptive randomized trial 
results:  
Arm Alert type  Open 
encounter  Follow -up 
booster  Pre-commitment  
1 Enhanced  X X  
2 Enhanced  X  X 
Usual care  None     
 
Arms 1 through 2 are enhanced  EHR tools to encourage the deprescribing of the 
medications under study.  Physicians randomized to usual care will receive no intervention.  
The central component of Arms 1 through  2 will be an enhanced EHR alert (known as a 
Best Practice Advisory [BPA]). The enhanced BPA will appear on each provider’s EHR screen 
and will contain several standard components .  The BPA will:  
1. give providers  information about why the medication is dangerous for their patient 
using the behavioral science principle of salience to make this information as 
impactful as possible ;  
2. include a set of tips to help providers discuss medication discontinuation with their 
patients ; 
3. ask provider s to select an acknowledgment reason if they decided not to discontinue 
the medication ; 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986521] 
(e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_722308]) , the EHR tools will appear for both classes  
separately.  
 
5.3 Measures to minimize bias: randomization and blinding  
 
Providers  will be randomized to treatment arms in equal proportions  based on blocks . We 
will use pr ovider -based cluster randomization to minimize the possibility of contamination in 
study interventions between practices and clinic staff. For the randomization, we will use 
stratified randomization based on clinic practice size and baseline rates of prescribing to 
reduce potential imbalances between the providers assigned to the treatment arms.   
The providers will not be blinded to which arm they were assigned to, as blinding is the 
context of an intervention that is intended to motivate action will be infeasible.  The study 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986522] baseline data on patients and providers using extracted EHR data and/or 
administrative claims data as applicable for the study aim. This baseline data will be used to 
assess any potential imbalances in the characteristics of providers or patients despi[INVESTIGATOR_722309]. The baseline data will include, but are not limited to:  gender, baseline rates of 
prescribing, practice location, and patient case -mix. We will also collect patient  data that 
include but are not limited to: sociodemographic data , medical history and comorbidities, 
baseline resource utilization in prior 12 months (i.e., number of visits) , biometric values (e.g., 
serum creatinine, systolic/diastolic blood pressures) .  
 
 
6.2  Outcomes  
 
The primary outcome will be a binary composite measure of a reduction in inappropriate 
prescribing , evaluated using EHR data.  In specific, we will measure a composite of 1) 
discontinuation of high -risk medications (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], sedative hypnotics, or 
anticholinergics)  defined by [CONTACT_5640]: a) active discontinuation and no subsequent order or b) no 
order during follow -up or 2) ordering a gradual dose taper (for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_722310]) . Our primary analyses will be within patients who had a visit (telemedicine or in -
person) with a study provider after randomization. If either of these actions is taken by  
[CONTACT_48368] s for a specific patient at any point in the follow -up window , we will classify the  patient 
as having had a reduction in inappropriate prescribing. If the patient has multiple therapeutic 
classes of interest (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_722308]), we will classify patients with 
a reduction for any class as a “reduction”  for the composite measure . We will also stratify 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
16 
 patients by [CONTACT_722325] (i.e., one, two, or three classes) and 
analyze outcomes within these strata.  
Secondary outcomes include the quantity of high -risk medication prescribed, defined by 
[CONTACT_141303][INVESTIGATOR_722311] -risk medications (all three classes) prescribed to patients in the follow -
up period  and number of lorazepam milligram equivalents of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_722312] . As above , we will also stratify 
patients by [CONTACT_722325] (i.e., one, two, or three classes) and 
analyze outcomes within these strata.  
Tertiary outcomes will include the extent to which medications are filled and consumed 
by [CONTACT_1962] , as measured within the subgroup of patients with claims data.  In specific, these 
outcomes will be conducted among the large subgroup of patients funded by [CONTACT_170311] , 
including pharmacy claims  via the  secure  MedRIC data enclave . In particular, we will measure 
the quantity of high -risk medication dispensed, defined by [CONTACT_722326]-risk medications filled by [CONTACT_1962], in follow -up, using pharmacy claims data. Other tertiary 
outcomes will include the occurrence of clinically -significant adverse drug events, including but 
not limited to, sedation or cognitive impairment , and all -cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_722313], measured in administrative claims data . These clinical outcomes will be evaluated 
using validated  and CMS -driven  ICD-10-CM diagnosis and procedure -based algorithms applied 
to these patients’ medical and pharmacy administrative claims data. Because the sensitivity of 
clinical outcomes in EHR systems is known to be low (e.g., because patients may seek 
subsequent care at other healthcare systems), using routinely -collected data from insurers 
overcomes this limitation.24 We will also evaluate implementation of the intervention using 
structured deidentified data from the EHR about use of the EHR system , which will help inform 
how to scale the interventions  (see Data to be collected form) .  
 
6.3 Adverse events  and unanticipated problems  
 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986523] their use. The 
decision support provides resources to help patients safely discontinue the high -risk 
medications under study (e.g., providing tapering guidelines and facilitating the substitution of 
lower -risk therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) . There is a theoretical risk of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_722314] , but the risk is less 
than the continued risks o f ongoing use of the drugs being addressed by [CONTACT_169345] . 
We will ensure the safety of patient -subjects by [CONTACT_722327] -making 
in the hands of the evaluating provider who is in charge of caring for the patient. The study 
team will not be providing any direct care to patients, and all treatment decisions will ultimately 
be made by [CONTACT_13935]’ own medical teams . As a result, any adverse events will be handled 
in the course of regular clinical care . Further, to maximize the generalizability of the results and 
to avoid co -intervention, patients will not be required to have study -specific monitoring as part 
of the proposed pragmatic trials. Therefore, we do not plan to use any patient -directed 
prospecti ve monitoring of Adverse Events ( AEs) or Significant Adverse Events ( SAEs ) in this 
trial. An Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as a ny untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human study participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical e xam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ 
involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research.   
- Adverse Events  will be classified using the following rating scales:  
o Severity: Mild, Moderate or Severe  
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
18 
 ▪ Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms but are easily tolerated  
▪ Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern but may 
interfere with daily activities but are usually improved by [CONTACT_39508]  
▪ Severe: Events interrupt the participants’ normal daily activities and 
generally require systemic drug therapy  
o Expectedness: Unexpected or Expected  
▪ Unexpected: nature or severity of the event is not consistent with the 
condition under study  
▪ Expected: event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition 
under study.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) are defined as any  adverse event that  results in death , is 
life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the  event as it 
occurred , requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, causes persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity , results in congenital anomalies or birth defects , and i s another condition which 
investigators judge to represent significant hazards . 
However, our plan for data and safety monitoring does include multiple mechanisms to 
ensure minimal risk of participation in the trials.  We will leverage an automatic adverse event 
reporting and review system to observe and monitor for any SAEs that do occur. In specific, 
providers report adverse events through a n online  reporting system. Any reports of deaths will 
be submitted to the NIA Program Officer and to the Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) 
Chair or designated DSMB member within 24 hours. Any unan ticipated SAEs deemed by [CONTACT_722328] 48 hours of the study’s knowledge of the SAE. 
All other reported SAEs and AEs received by [CONTACT_722329] -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025

 7. Statistical Considerations  
 
7.1  Statistical Hypotheses  
 
Our null hypothesis will be that rates of provider prescribing  (defined by [CONTACT_110042] a 
reduction in prescribing  of high -risk medication ) in the intervention arms will be no different 
than in the other arms, including the usual care arm.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_986524]  >80% power to detect absolute differences of 10% or smaller in the 
reduction in prescribing  between each  intervention arms and usual care, assuming an intra -
provider  correlation of 0. 1 (which is based on prior work including the Atrius trial)  and a 
baseline rate of the primary outcome of 25% in the usual care arm . We plan to use Holm -
Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing  between each of the intervention arms and 
usual care , but we will be powered even if using a Bonferroni correction. Our assumptions will 
also be robust to a slightly higher baseline rate of the primary outcome in the usual care arm. 
We should also be sufficiently powered to detect meaningful differences in the clinically 
significant adverse events.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_986525] for clustering and repeated 
observations  per provider  to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention arms versus usual 
care. For the inappropriate prescribing outcome, we will use a log link function and binary 
distributed errors. These models generate the estimated relative risks (RRs) with robust 
standard errors and are considered to be particularly a ppropriate when outcomes are common 
(e.g., incidences of ≥10%).  Because this is a randomized trial, our primary analyses are 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
21 
 planned as unadjusted; however, in secondary analyses, we will adjust for patient age, 
race/ethnicity, and gender . 
Given the nature of the data and how the outcomes are categorized, there will not be 
missing values for the primary endpoint, as the absence of action is classified as no action by 
[CONTACT_13917]. For the primary analysis, we will include all eligible patien ts in the denominator 
who had at least one visit with their primary care provider. In secondary analyses, we will 
include all eligible patients of those primary care providers in the denominator, regardless of 
whether the patient visited the provider over the follow -up period.  
 
 
7.3.2  Analysis of secondary endpoints  
 
For the secondary outcome of cumulative medication prescribing , will use an identity 
link function and normally distributed errors within the generalized linear model s. For tertiary 
adverse clinical outcomes  and resource utilization outcomes , we will use a log link function and 
binary distributed errors. These models generate the estimated relative risks (RRs) with robust 
standard errors and are considered to be particularly appropriate when outcomes are common 
(e.g., incidences of ≥10%). For  these outcomes from claims data, we will follow patients whose 
providers are randomized to the study from the time of randomization until they are censored 
due to lose of continuous enrollment in their health plan . Due to the nature of the 
randomization, we do not anticipate any systematic differences in the amount of follow -up time 
per arm but will account for any imbalances using inverse probability censoring weights.  
Because this is a randomized trial, our primary analyses are planned as unadjusted; 
however, if there are strong patient -level predictors of the outcomes not balanced by [CONTACT_96237], we will adjust for these. Given the nature of the data and h ow the outcomes are 
being measured, there should not be missing values. However, should there be sufficient 
missing data (e.g., >10%), we will use multiple imputation.25

MGB Trial Protocol  
22 
 7.3.3 Baseline descriptive analyses  
 
We will report the means and frequencies of pre -randomization variables separately for 
intervention and control subjects.  Comparisons of these values will be performed using t -tests 
and chi square tests and their non -parametric analogs, as appropriate. The outcomes will be 
evaluated using intention -to-treat principles among all randomized patients.  
 
 
7.3.4 Subgroup analyses  
 
In subgroup analyses, we will explore whether there were any modifiers of the effects of 
the EHR tools. For example, we will explore if certain types of providers (e.g., by [CONTACT_101699]) 
were more likely to respond to the EHR tools or if there were observable differences in patients 
who w ere less likely to receive inappropriate medications, such as gender or race/ethnicity.  
 
7.3.5 Exploratory analyses  
 
In secondary analyses, we will control for potential confounders which will be measured 
using EHR data from structured fields and administrative claims data. These variables will 
include provid er characteristics (such as s pecialty, age, and gender), patient characteristics 
(such as major comorbidities, race/ethnicity, and age), and practice characteristics (such as 
practice size).  
 
8. Ethical and regulatory requirements  
8.[ADDRESS_986526] by [CONTACT_54852] (Drs. Choudhry and 
Lauffenburger) will occur throughout the study period, including regular contact [CONTACT_722330]. In addition, 
this protocol will undergo Institutional Review Board (IRB) evaluation by a centralized IRB for 
this multi -site clinical trial. Study data will be accessible at all times for the principal 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
23 
 investigators (Drs. Choudhry and Lauffenburger) and co -investigators to review, if applicable. 
The principal investigators will review study conduct (e.g., protocol deviations) on a monthly 
basis. The principal investigators will also ensure that all proto col deviations for the trials are 
reported to the NIH and the IRB according to the applicable regulatory requirements.  
 We believe that the risks to participation for both sets of subjects (i.e. providers and 
patients) are no more than minimal for several reasons.  
 First, the intervention aims to emphasize guideline -recommended information for 
providers to assist in their decision -making when caring for older patients. Second, all 
treatment decisions will ultimately be made by [CONTACT_39516]. Finally,  the 
intervention is specifically provider -focused and delivered in an electronic health record system 
using information already available to providers. We believe there is no more than minimal risk 
involved to the provider subjects, as the providers will  simply be “nudged” to alter their 
behaviors towards guideline recommended care, as opposed to being forced to do so. All 
medical decisions are ultimately made by [CONTACT_13917] . This trial will not interfere with the 
ordinary workings of the outpatient centers.  
There is a small risk associated with altering medication prescribing behaviors, 
including allergic reactions or other adverse medication effects; however , these risks are no 
more than are encountered during routine clinical care and are less than patients would 
otherwise encounter if there were to receive the high -risk medications whose use the 
intervention seeks to reduce. In addition, these risks will be minimized in our protocol as we 
are relying on the provider to prescribe as they see best for their p atient; the prescribing 
changes in the EHR tools are simply suggestions, not rigid rules for the providers.  In addition, 
as described above, in  the unexpected situation in which the EHR tools lead to worse 
prescribing decisions, we will discontinue those arms at the end of Stage  1. 
The primary risk to patients will be privacy of health information. We will minimize the 
risk to privacy by [CONTACT_722331]. Clinical 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986527] staff to 
ensure the accuracy of these data throughout the study period. For the purpose of conducting 
analyses of the study outcomes, this will involve creating scrambled patient and provider 
identifiers and sharing only limited Protected Health Information (PHI) with investigators for the 
purposes of analysis. All tea m members have received appropriate training in data privacy.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_986528], the nature of this quality improvement intervention 
involves testing EHR decision supp ort directly for providers (using information already available 
to them and a similar infrastructure they use in the course of re gular clinical care). Second, the 
ability to understand the true effect of the intervention as it is delivered in the real world would 
be difficult to ascertain if true informed consent was sought. Third, o btaining true informed 
consent would predictably reduce the number of patients participating in the study, especially 
those from unrepresented populations, and therefore undermine the generalizability of the 
study results, a foundational aspect of pragmati c clinical trial principles. Fourth, t his approach  
has been  approved by [CONTACT_722332]. In our prior work at these 
institutions, we have received a waiver of informed consent from the IRBs of these 
organizations for similar interventions. We also request a HIPAA waiver of patient au thorization 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986529] of pharmacy 
and medical claims, laboratory information, and structured information from the EHR. The only 
PHI that will be shared with the study investigators are dates (e.g., date of birth, 
admission/discharge da tes, and dates of medication fills ), zip code , and Medicare Beneficiary 
Identifier (MBI), which is necessary in order to ac cess the Medicare administrative claims data 
for the outcome evaluation . Sharing this information will be necessary to assess the impact of 
the interventions.  
The electronic data will be safeguarded by [CONTACT_54443] -of-the-art security protocols. The 
facilities have [ADDRESS_986530] -protected access only to study investigators. All data transfer s between the 
organizations will be accomplished using secure file transfer protocols.  To ensure the 
confidentiality and security of all data, the research team operates a secure, state -of-the-art 
computing facility housed at MGB’s  data center. The MGB  data center is a secure facility that 
houses both computing environments as well as clinical systems and electronic medical 
records for several large hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39481]. Entry into the computer room 
requires staffed computer room security. The Division’s computers are connected to the MGB  
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
26 
 networking backbone with 10 gigabit -per-second fiber links. Network security is overseen by 
[CONTACT_39522]’s data. All data are transmitted to 
programmers’ workstations in an encrypted state. Backups are created using the current 
Department of Defense standard for data security  and are stored in a locked facility. The 
redundancy, extensive data power, and security of our computer facility confirm our capacity to 
collect and manage data and ensure confidentiality for all project participants.  
As described, all members of the research team have completed or will complete 
appropriate human subjects research training and patient privacy training related to the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The setup for analysis of these HIPAA -
limited data will be exactly the same as all of the other IRB applications that our MGB  research 
division submits for secondary use of data. In fact, we have an umbrella -approval place in 
place with the  MGB  IRB for using these types of HIPAA -limited data. All of the datasets, 
including limited PHI, will be stored only on secure servers at MGB  Healthcare’s data center 
and will only be accessed by a limited number of individuals in the study team from this division 
who are all trained in data security and patient privacy.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_986531] (IRB) and a Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) for all aspects of this research. We will also establish an 
independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) with experience in quality of care, 
patient safety, and biostatistics. The DSMB will act in an advisory capacity to monitor 
participant safety and evaluate the progress of the st udy, review procedures and management 
of the study. Drs. Choudhry and Lauffenburger are the PIs at  MGB . The DSMB will consist of  
individuals  with experience in quality of care, patient safety, and biostatistics. This committee 
will convene  biannually and review data related to the study protocols and ensure protection of 
patient confidentiality and safety, as well as to monitor the quality of the data collected via the 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986532] with clinical 
leadership to obtain any feedback from clinicians regarding the studies. Compliance of 
regulatory documents and study data accuracy and completeness will be maintained through 
an internal study team quality assurance process.  At each meeting, the DSMB  will make 
recommendations as to whether the studies  should continue or if changes to the protocol are 
necessary for continuation.  This trial will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.  
 
8.5 Benefit risk assessment  
8.5.1 Known potential risks  
There is a small risk associated with altering medication prescribing behaviors, including 
allergic reactions or other adverse medication effects; however , these risks are no more than are 
encountered during routine clinical care. In addition, these risks will be minimized in our protocol as 
we are relying on the provider to prescribe as they see best for their patient; the prescribing 
changes in the EHR too ls are simply suggestions, not rigid rules for the providers.  In the 
intervention arms, providers will be encouraged to follow national guidelines in the care of their 
patients and discontinue dangerous medications. It is recommended that some of these 
medications (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], sedative hypnotics) be discontinued through a gradual dose taper 
so as to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and suggested tapers will be provided as a solution within the 
EHR prompts.  Another potential small risk to patients will be pri vacy of health information. We will 
minimize the risk to privacy by [CONTACT_722333]. Clinical data on the care for patients will be retrieved from the electronic medical 
records and insurer administra tive claim s. 
 
8.5.[ADDRESS_986533] prescribing tools for providers 
caring for older adults. Potential benefits for participants in this study include improved decision 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April [ADDRESS_986534] system using information already available to providers. 
We believe there is no more than minimal risk involved to the provider subjects, as the providers 
will simply be “nudged” to al ter their behaviors towards guideline recommended care, as opposed 
to being forced to do so. All medical decisions are ultimately made by [CONTACT_13917]. This trial will not 
interfere with the ordinary workings of the outpatient centers.   
The potential societal benefits outweigh the minimal risk, especially in light of multiple 
measures in place to protect confidentiality.  The data extracts obtained from the electronic medical 
record and these claims are continuously used by [CONTACT_722334], and undergo routine, rigorous peer -review by [CONTACT_722335].  For the purpose of conducting analyses of the study 
outcomes, this will involve creating scramble d patient and provider identifiers and sharing only 
limited Protected Health Information (PHI) with investigators for the purposes of analysis.  Because 
our intervention encourages providers to discontinue dangerous medications in a way that 
prioritized patient safety and enables the provider to retain full decision -making power of the care 
of the patient, there is no more than minimal risk involve d for our patient and physician -subjects.

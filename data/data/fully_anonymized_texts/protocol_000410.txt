Prospective single center study in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_606907].   Study purpose and rationale Immunosuppressive therapy with the calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (Tac), has radically changed the field of organ transplantation. Ironically, although extensively and effectively used for kidney and other solid organ transplants, CsA and Tac cause significant adverse renal side effects: acute and chronic renal dysfunction, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, hypertension, electrolyte disturbances and tubular acidosis. Chronic nephrotoxicity from CNI has been implicated as a principal cause of post-transplant renal dysfunction. It is characterized by [CONTACT_118292], interstitial fibrosis, and focal hyalinosis of small renal arteries and arterioles. Furthermore, by [CONTACT_149614]2 production, this class of medications is also associated with a negative impact on generation of regulatory T cells, or (Tregs). (Tregs are an important subpopulation of helper T cells that has been associated with positive immunomodulation and donor specific hypo-responsiveness).   In renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], complete avoidance of calcineurin inhibitors from the time of renal transplant surgery has been associated with increased incidence of acute cellular rejection. The combination of mTOR inhibitors with full dose CNI has been shown to be synergistically nephrotoxic, and has been associated with poor graft outcome. We and other investigators have tested conversion from CNI to mTOR inhibitors with promising results. We have shown that in a prednisone-free immunosuppression regimen, conversion from tacrolimus to mTor inhibitors is safe, and not associated with an increased risk of acute rejection. More importantly, we have shown that it is associated with a persistent increase of regulatory T cells (Data presented at ATC 09 and 2010).  Recently, the A2309 study led to FDA-approval of Everolimus. The A2309 was a study designed to combine reduced dose CsA+Everolimus. Interestingly, the reduced exposure to CsA was not associated with an increased rate of ACR; renal allograft function was well maintained when compared to that of the control group. This study 
Investigator’s name: [CONTACT_606923] 2 Study name: [CONTACT_606924]: 10-26-2017 Everolimus ePRISM ID:  IIRP-1275 study leads us to question the mechanism(s) behind the efficacy of a low dose CNI with an mTOR inhibitor in preventing acute allograft rejection.    The present proposal is designed to investigate the mechanisms of the synergistic effect(s) of low dose CNI and mTOR inhibitors (Everolimus) in controlling alloreactive T and B cells while expanding Tregs.    Our hypothesis, based on published data and our laboratory results (see preliminary data-Supportive documents), is that mTOR inhibitors allow expansion of Tregs and that low exposure to CNI is sufficient to control alloreactive T cells. Decreased exposure to CNI and concomitant increase of Tregs will then translate to improved renal allograft function and histology.  Objectives  The overall aim of the present study is to prospectively investigate the impact of two maintenance immunosuppressive regimens (both prednisone-free) on subpopulations of T and B cells and on renal allograft function at 12, [ADDRESS_804054]-randomization. One regimen combines low CNI exposure (tacrolimus) with concentration controlled Everolimus, and the second combines standard dose CNI (Tacrolimus) with MMF.  The primary endpoints of the study are to: 1) evaluate the impact of the two maintenance immunonusuppressive regimens on T cells subpopulations, including regulatory T cells and B cell subpopulations, at different time points post renal transplant, and2) determine the impact of the two regimens on renal allograft function at 12, [ADDRESS_804055]-randomization (post-transplant). Secondary endpoints of the study are to: 1) evaluate the impact of the two regimens on allograft immunohistopathology gene expression profiles and graft infiltrating cells (memory T cell (CD4+ or CD8+ CD45RO+), TREG (CD4+FoxP3+), memory B cell (CD19+CD27+)) at 12 and 24 months in renal allograft biopsies, and 2) evaluate the impact of the regimens on acute rejection, graft loss and death at 12, [ADDRESS_804056]-transplant.  Population The study will be conducted at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine/Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and subjects will be recruited during visits to the Comprehensive Transplant Center.

Investigator’s name: [CONTACT_606923] 5 Study name: [CONTACT_606924]: 10-26-2017 Everolimus ePRISM ID:  IIRP-1275 we will look at regulatory T cells (Treg: Foxp3+CD4+ CD25bright+) that could have been generated via the two maintenance immunonusuppressive regimens, and correlate the generation of with their function.   RNA from peripheral blood will be also collected and stored for post-hoc analyses of T and B-cell immunoresponse gene expression via gene arrays.   Kidney biopsy samples will be collected with standard-of-care samples at time of transplant (back table), [ADDRESS_804061]-transplant. These will help evaluateand compare the impacts of the two maintenance immunonusuppressive regimens on allograft immunohistopathology.  Gene expression profiles will also be analyzed.  These samples will be processed in the principal investigator’s research laboratory.    Both groups of subjects will be followed through 36-months post-randomization. In addition to monitoring renal allograft function, we will evaluate the incidence of acute rejection, subject and graft survival, incidence of hypertension (HTN), malignancies, opportunistic infections and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (DM).  Donors: Blood samples from donor subjects will also be obtained at either the time of randomization or post-surgery during standard-of-care follow-up appointments These donor leukocytes will be used as stimulator cells in studies of functional activity of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] T-cells.

Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_606916]-transplant infections (i.e., UTI, CMV, HSV, EBV, HCV, HBV, HIV,PCP), that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_606917]/her participation in this research trial, will be stopped from participating in this study..

Statistical analysis:   The primary endpoints of the study are graft function and subpopulations of T cells, including regulatory T cells and B cell subpopulations at 3, 6, 12, [ADDRESS_804063] kidney transplant. The secondary endpoints of the study include 1) incidence of acute rejection, graft loss, and death at 12,[ADDRESS_804064] kidney transplant; 2) allograft immunohistopathology and gene expression profiles at [ADDRESS_804065] all variables for linear relationships or non-linear relationships.   Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation, frequency) and correlations (both Pearson and Spearman) among variables will be calculated for preliminary data assessment. Necessary transformation and imputations will be carried out based on the raw data distribution.   As missing data are inevitable in a longitudinal study, we will determine whether missing data are MCAR (data are missing completely at random), MAR (data are missing at random), or NMAR (not missing at random). If missing data are MCAR or MAR, it is likely that the standard multivariate computations using PROC MI (multiple imputations) will not result in biased standard error estimates.   However, if missing data are NMAR, we will use the "pattern mixture" approach to compute a weighted average of the parameters that are associated with the missing data to estimate what the data would have been.  For the primary objective, we hypothesize that subjects receiving low dose CNI with mTOR inhibitor (Everolimus) will exhibit significantly greater graft function and higher numbers of regulatory T cells as compared to the standard dose CNI+MMF group.   We will utilize both repeated-measures ANOVA and random mixed effect models to compare the trajectory change in graft function and proportion of regulatory T cells over 12, 24 and 36 months between the two experimental groups. The method of estimation will be maximum likelihood (ML).    
Investigator’s name: [CONTACT_606923] 8 Study name: [CONTACT_606924]: 10-26-2017 Everolimus ePRISM ID:  IIRP-1275 A variety of covariance structures (first order regressive, compound symmetry, Toeplitz, variance components, unstructured) will be carefully examined and compared using the best fitting statistics, such as Akaike’s Information (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). These statistics are likelihood functions and can be compared across models. If, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_606918], distributions of subjects’ baseline characteristics are found to be different between the two experimental groups, these variables will be entered as covariates in the statistical analysis.  For the secondary endpoints, we will use logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards models to analyze time-to-event outcomes (acute rejection, graft failure, and death). For allograft immunohistopathology and gene expression profile outcomes, we will first develop a comprehensive immune profile of each participant by [CONTACT_606921] T and B cell subsets. We will examine how these correlate with immunohistopathology and alloantibody production using Pearson or Spearman correlations. We will compare correlation coefficients between the two experimental groups using Z -tests to determine the distinct effects of each treatment arm.  We will also compare the trajectory changes in cell populations and antibody production over 12, [ADDRESS_804066] models. All tests will be two-sided, and an error rate of α <0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All data analyses will be performed using SAS 9.2 statistical software (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).       Sample size and power   We calculated our sample power for the two primary endpoints based on our clinical experience and small pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]. Using a two-tailed α of 0.05, the anticipated effect sizes corresponding to each specific aim between the two treatment arms were calculated using a minimum of 80% statistical power and assumed 10% attrition at 12 months.   For the sample size of n= [ADDRESS_804067] size of 1.0 and 2.0 for graft function and % regulatory T cell change, respectively, between the two treatment arms.  Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we do not consider the statistical power of secondary outcomes; It is anticipated that a much larger sample size will be needed in order to achieve statistical power for the secondary endpoints in this proposed study.

Little is known about the impact of immunosuppressive (IS) drugs on allospecific T cell subpopulations. Methods: A two-step culture system was used. Alloreactve memory CD4+ T cells were first generated in MLR culture with responding CD4+CD45RA+ nave T cells and allogeneic CD14+ monocytes. Memory CD4+ T cells, from the primary MLR, were enriched and re-stimulated by [CONTACT_3252]-culturing with autologous CD14+ monocytes in the presence of antigenic stimulation of anti-CD3 to increase the frequency of Th1,Th17 and Treg cells. Two different IS agents, Tacrolimus (Tac) and Sirolimus (SRL) were added to the second culture alone or in combination at different concentrations. The effects on the generation of Th1, Th17, Treg cells from alloreactive memory T cells (CD4+CD45RO+) were then determined by [CONTACT_15242]. Results: After secondary stimulation, there was up to 10-fold increase, compared to primary stimulation, in the % of Th1, Th17 and Treg cells. Tac at low doses, significantly blocked the productions of IFN- (Th1) and IL-17 (Th17), while SRL even at high concentration (10ng/ml or 20ng/ml) had minimal effect on IFN- and IL-17 production (see top panels of figure). FOXP3 expression (Treg) was markedly increased in SRL compared to Tac (see bottom panel). When Tac and SRL were used in combination and at different concentrations, we found that Tac at 2-5 ng/ml with SRL at 2.5-10ng/ml achieved the maximal effect in inhibiting the production of IFN- and IL-17 while maintaining a high level

 Conclusions: Tac and SRL have differential effects on subpopulation of T helper cells. These findings can help to guide the clinical use of IS drugs to promote Treg expansion while controlling Th1 and Th17 responses.

Confidential  Page 12 of 145 1 SUMMARY  
EP0034 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, extension study to obtain long-term safety and 
efficacy data in pediatric subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_67530] -onset seizures treated with 
lacosamide (LCM) oral solution or LCM tablets as adjunctive therapy. The study will provide 
continued availability of LCM to subjects who have c ompleted SP0969 (pediatric subjects with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_579604] ≥4  to <17 years with partial -onset seizures). EP0034 will also be open to subjects 
who participate in SP0967 (pediatric subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_579604] 1  month to <4 years with 
partial -onset seizures). Bot h SP0969 and SP0967 are Phase 3, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
studies for LCM as adjunctive therapy.  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1004130] of a pproximately 2 years. The 
number of sites is dependent on the number of enrolling centers from SP0967 and SP0969. The 
study will be conducted in North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia/Pacific regions, 
with the possibility to expand the study to  other countries and regions if deemed necessary. At 
selected sites, subjects may also be able to participate in a substudy without withdrawing from 
EP0034.  
The study medication is LCM in either the oral solution formulation or tablet formulation. 
Subjects  may take either oral solution or tablets during the Treatment Period, based on clinical 
judgment, regardless of their weight. Lacosamide will be administered twice daily (bid) at 
approximately [ADDRESS_1004131] been 
transitioned to a dose of LCM according to their weight. Subje cts will receive 
LCM  10mg/kg/day (oral solution) for subjects weighing <30kg, LCM 6mg/kg/day (oral solution) 
for subjects weighing ≥30kg to <50kg, and LCM 300mg/day (tablets) for subjects weighing 
≥50kg during at least their first week in the Treatment Per iod of EP0034. After [ADDRESS_1004132] the LCM dose during the Treatment Period based on clinical 
judgment within a range of 2mg/kg/day to 12mg/kg/day for the oral solution and 100mg/day to 
600mg/day for the tablets.  
During the Treatment Period, study visits are scheduled at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 
60, 72, 84, and 96. Telephone contacts are scheduled at Weeks 2, 6, 10, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 
66, and 78. Subjects who withdraw from treatment during the study should taper off LCM if the 
following doses are achieved: LCM ≥3mg/kg/day (oral solution) for subjects receiving LCM oral 
solution, or LCM ≥150mg/day (tablet) for subjects taking tablets; lower doses will not require a 
taper. An Early Termination Visit must be co mpleted for all subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from the study. Subjects who complete the study or withdraw prematurely from the 
study, and who discontinue use of LCM, should complete a Safety Follow -Up Visit 2 weeks 
(±2 days) after the final dose of LCM. A Safety Follow -Up Telephone Contact [CONTACT_97632]

Safety will be evaluated based on the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), the results of periodic 
clinical labor atory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical (Tanner Stage, if applicable, 
depending on subject’s developmental status) and neurological examinations, vital signs (blood 
pressure and pulse rate) monitoring, and body weight and height.  
The efficacy vari ables will be based on seizure diary data and will include the percentage of 
seizure -free days during the study. The following other efficacy variables based on seizure diary 
data will be computed for subjects from SP0969: the percentage of 50% responders (subjects 
with at least a 50% reduction in total partial -onset seizure frequency per 28  days compared to 
Baseline) and the percentage of 50% responders per seizure type (simple partial, complex partial, 
or secondarily generalized) compared to Baseline, the  percentage of 75% responders (subjects 
with at least a 75% reduction in total partial -onset seizure frequency per 28 days compared to 
Baseline) and the percentage of 75% responders per seizure type (simple partial, complex partial, 
or secondarily generali zed) compared to Baseline, absolute and percent reduction in total partial -
onset seizures and per partial -onset seizure type (simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily 
generalized) compared to Baseline (Baseline is defined as the period before receiv ing study 
medication in the previous pediatric study), and partial -onset seizure frequency per 28 days. The 
following other efficacy variables will be computed for all subjects in EP0034: achievement of 
seizure -free status (no seizure) during the study for  total partial -onset seizure and per seizure 
type (simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily generalized), Clinical Global Impression of 
Change, and Caregiver’s Global Impression of Change.  
Other evaluations will include behavioral and cognition ass essments (Achenbach Child Behavior 
Checklist [CBCL], Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF®]/BRIEF 
Preschool Version [BRIEF®-P], and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third 
Edition [Bayley -III®] for subjects enrolled in Engl ish-speaking countries), quality of life 
assessments (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory [PedsQL™]), health care resource use

Confidential  Page 14 of 145 according to a number of criteria, including seizure type, cause, anatomy, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4582], 
age at onset, and sometimes prognosis.  
The newer AEDs differ from older agents in several important ways, including mechanism of 
action, spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics (Herman and Pedley, 
1998). However, more than 30% of patients have inadequate seizure control on currently 
available AEDs or experience significant adverse drug effects (CHMP/EWP/566/98, 2010). 
Therefore, a need remains for AEDs with improved effectiveness and tolerability (Sander, 1998).  
Among the newer AEDs, only 6 (gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], 
levetiracetam, and perampanel) have successfully demonstrated efficacy as adjunctive therapy in 
children with difficult to treat partial -onset seizures (Rheims and Ryvlin, 2013; Glauser et al, 
2006; Glauser et al, 2000; Appleton et al, 1999; Duchowny et al,  1999; Elterman et al, 1999). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_67522], more than 25% of pediatric patients have inadequate 
seizure control on currently available AEDs or experience significant adverse drug effects 
(Hadjiloizou and Bourgeois, 2007).  
Lacosamide (VIMPAT®; SPM 927; previously referred to as harkoseride; [R] 2 -acetamido -N-
benzyl -3-methoxypropi[INVESTIGATOR_67515], ADD 234037) belongs to a novel class of functionalized amino 
acids. It has minimal protein binding and effect on cytochrome P450 enzyme sys tem function 
(reducing the risk of drug -drug interactions), high oral bioavailability, and a half -life of 
approximately 13 hours (in adults), which allows a bid dose regimen. It also displays 
dose-proportional PK following administration over a range of do ses up to 800mg in adults.  
Lacosamide has been approved as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of 
partial -onset seizures in patients 17 years of age and older in the [LOCATION_002] (tablets, oral 
solution, and solution for intravenous [iv] in fusion) and as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in 
the treatment of partial -onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients 16 
years of age and older in the European Union (tablets, oral solution, and solution for iv infusion). 
The ora l solution (also referred to as syrup) is a formulation suitable for administration to 
children. Bioequivalence has been shown between the tablet and oral solution formulations, 
comparing 2  tablets of LCM 100mg and the oral solution containing LCM 200mg, a fter 
single -dose administration in healthy subjects. The PK of LCM and SPM [ZIP_CODE] (major LCM 
metabolite in humans) in plasma, urine, and saliva were identical or very similar after single oral 
doses of LCM 200mg administered as tablets or as oral solution.  
In the clinical development program for LCM, safety and tolerability of multiple doses of up to 
LCM 400mg bid (LCM 800mg/day) were evaluated in approximately 800 unique volunteers who 
received LCM in Phase 1 studies. The safety and efficacy of LCM has also  been evaluated in 
Phase 2/3 studies as adjunctive oral therapy in over 1300 adult subjects with partial -onset 
seizures and as oral monotherapy in over 2400 adult subjects in other indications (neuropathic 
pain, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and migraine p rophylaxis). In addition, LCM solution for 
infusion was evaluated as short -term replacement therapy in a subset of subjects with 
partial -onset seizures (220 patients) who were receiving adjunctive LCM tablets.  
Three double -blind, placebo -controlled, multic enter studies (SP667, SP754, and SP755) in 
1308  adult subjects, aged 16 to 70 years, established the efficacy of oral LCM as adjunctive 
therapy (1 to 3 concomitant AEDs) in subjects with difficult to control partial -onset seizures. In 
these studies, LCM wa s initiated at a dose of 100mg/day (in 2 divided doses) and escalated to the

week increments.  
When oral LCM was administered as adjunctive therapy at doses up to 600mg/day in  the 
[ADDRESS_1004136] frequently reported treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) were central nervous system - and 
gastrointestinal -associated events. A dose relationship was s een for the most frequently reported 
common TEAEs, including dizziness, nausea, and diplopia. The nature and frequency of AEs 
were comparable to adjunctive therapy with other marketed AEDs. Safety evaluations support 
the further development of LCM as an AE D. 
Pellock et al have recently conducted a systematic review of AEDs used in the treatment of 
partial -onset seizures (Bourgeois and Goodkin, 2012; Pellock et al, 2012). The AEDs that were 
shown to be superior to placebo for the adjunctive treatment of part ial-onset seizures in adult 
clinical studies were also shown to be superior to placebo for adjunctive treatment of 
partial -onset seizures in the pediatric clinical studies (subjects >2 years of age) in which they 
were investigated. The efficacy and safety of LCM observed in clinical studies in adults and 
preclinical data, as well as many additional attributes of LCM, render the drug appropriate to 
investigate in pediatric subjects. These attributes include predictable and linear PK, lack of 
drug-drug intera ctions, easy twice daily dosing, and the availability of 3 different types of 
formulations in multiple strengths (allowing for flexibility in dose range and individualizing 
treatment).  
EP0034 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, extension study to obtain  long-term safety and 
efficacy data in pediatric subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_67530] -onset seizures treated with LCM oral 
solution or LCM tablets as adjunctive therapy. The study will provide continued availability of 
LCM to subjects who have completed SP0 969 (pediatric subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_579604] ≥4 to 
<17 years with partial -onset seizures). EP0034 will also be open to subjects who participate in 
SP0967 (pediatric subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_579604] 1 month to <4 years with partial -onset seizures).

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_24571] a condition for which an improved benefit/risk ratio for medicinal products remains a 
challenge; this is  especially true for pediatric patients.  
EP0034 will provide continued availability of LCM to subjects who have completed SP0969, 
which is a Phase 3, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LCM as adjunctive therapy in pediatric subjects with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ≥4  years to <17  years of age with partial -onset seizures. EP0034 will also be open to 
subjects who complete SP0967, which is the planned confirmatory study for LCM as adjunctive 
therapy in pediatric subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_579604] ≥1 month to <4 years with partial -onset seizures.  
Dose selection in EP0034 is based on the primary studies (ie, SP0969 and SP0967). During 
EP0034, investigators will be allowed to increase or decrease the dos e of LCM to optimize 
tolerability and seizure reduction for each subject. Lacosamide doses may be increased up to a 
maximum of LCM 600mg/day or 12mg/kg/day, whichever is lower based on body weight.

has elevations only in total bilirubin that are >ULN and <1.5xULN, fractionate bilirubin to 
identify possible undiagnosed Gilbert’s syndrome (ie, direct bilirubi n <35%).  
For enrolled subjects with a Baseline result >ULN for ALT, AST, ALP, or total bilirubin, a 
Baseline diagnosis and/or the cause of any clinically meaningful elevation must be 
understood and recorded in the electronic Case Report form (eCRF).  
6.[ADDRESS_1004163]’s legal representatives are free to withdraw the 
subject from the study at any time, without prejudice to their continued care.  
Participation in this study must  be discontinued for any of the follo wing reasons:  
1. Subject experiences intolerable AEs, including clinically relevant abnormal laboratory 
findings that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], preclude further participation in the study.  
2. The sponsor or a regulatory agency requests withdrawal of the subject.  
3. Subject has a QTc interval ≥500ms that is confirmed by a cardiologist over read on any ECG.

Participation in this study may be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
1. Any clinically relevant change in medical or psychiatric condition (if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the condition warrants discontinuation from the study).  
2. Subject r equires a medication that is not permitted by [CONTACT_760] (see Section 7.8.1 ). 
3. Subject and/or legal representative is noncompliant with study proced ures or medication, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
Subjects discontinuing LCM for any reason should taper off medication as described in 
Section  7.2.[ADDRESS_1004167] to follow -up, the investigator should make an 
effort (at least [ADDRESS_1004168] and/or legal representative), and 
document his/her effort (date and summary of the phone call and copy of the writt en message in 
the source documents), to complete the final evaluation. All results of these evaluations and 
observations, together with a narrative description of the reason(s) for removing the subject, 
must be recorded in the source documents. All subject s who withdraw from the study due to an 
AE must be followed until resolution of the event or until the event is considered stable. The 
eCRF must document the primary reason for withdrawal or discontinuation.  
6.3.1  Potential drug -induced liver injury IMP disconti nuation criteria  
Subjects with potential drug -induced liver injury (PDILI) must be assessed to determine if 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) must be immediately and permanently discontinued. In 
addition, all concomitant medications and herbal supple ments that are not medically necessary 
should also be discontinued.  
The PDILI criteria below require immediate and permanent discontinuation of IMP:  
• Subjects with either of the following:  
− ALT or AST ≥5xULN  
− ALT or AST ≥3xULN and coexisting total bilirubin ≥2xULN  
The PDILI criterion below requires immediate discontinuation of IMP:  
• Subjects with ALT or AST ≥3xULN who exhibit temporally associated symptoms of 
hepatitis or hypersensitivity. Hepatitis symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadr ant pain or tenderness. Hypersensitivity symptoms include fever (without clear 
alternative cause), rash, or eosinophilia (ie, >5%).  
The PDILI criterion below allows for subjects to continue on IMP at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
• Subjects with ALT or  AST ≥3xULN (and ≥2x Baseline), and <5xULN, total bilirubin 
<2xULN, and no eosinophilia (ie, ≤5%), with no fever, rash, or symptoms of hepatitis (eg, 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness)

UCB   [ADDRESS_1004169] be discontinued immediately.  
Investigators should attempt to obtain information on subjects in the case of IMP discontinuation 
to complete the final evaluation. Subjects with PDILI should not be withdrawn from the study 
until investigation and monitoring are complete. All results of t hese evaluations and 
observations, as well as the reason(s) for IMP discontinuation and subject withdrawal (if 
applicable), must be recorded in the source documents. The eCRF must document the primary 
reason for IMP discontinuation.

7.[ADDRESS_1004170] (IMP) will be provided as LCM oral solution (LCM 10mg/mL) 
and LCM tablets (LCM 50mg and LCM 100mg).  
The oral solution formulation contains 10mg/mL of drug substance and is color less to pale 
yellow in appearance.  
The tablet formulation will be supplied in doses of 50mg and 100mg. The 50mg tablets are light 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745], oval, film -coated tablets debossed with “SP” on one side and “50” on the other. The 100mg 
tablets are dark yellow, oval , film -coated tablets debossed with “SP” on one side and “100” on 
the other.  
7.2 Treatment(s) to be administered  
Lacosamide will be administered bid (at approximately 12 -hour intervals, once in the morning 
and once in the evening) in divided doses. The oral s olution formulation will be measured and 
administered via a dosing syringe.  
Oral administration is the preferred route in this study. Feeding tube administration is an 
alternative route in case a subject is unable to swallow the study medication.  
Each subj ect’s weight will be monitored at every visit, and the LCM dose will be adjusted 
accordingly.

Confidential  Page 39 of 145 7.5 Handling and storage requirements  
Lacosamide is to be stored according to the instructions on the label.  
The investigator (or designee) is responsible for the safe and proper storage of IMP  at the site. 
Investigational medicinal product stored by [CONTACT_207278] a secured area with 
limited access.  
Appropriate storage conditions must be ensured either by [CONTACT_58952] a temperature log in ac cordance with local requirements on a regular basis, 
showing minimum and maximum temperatures reached over the time interval.  
In case an out -of-range temperature is noted, it must be immediately communicated to the 
sponsor’s designee in accordance with the  pharmacy manual.  
The investigator (or designee) will instruct the subject to store the IMP following the instructions 
on the label.  
7.[ADDRESS_1004174] (due to breakage or wastage), not used, disposed of at the study site, or returned to 
the sponsor’s designee must also be recorded on the appropriate form s. All supplies and 
pharmacy documentation must be made available throughout the study for UCB (or designee) to 
review.  
The investigator (or designee) is responsible for retaining all used, unused, and partially used 
containers of IMP until returned.  
The i nvestigator may assign some of the investigator’s duties for drug accountability at the study 
site to an appropriate pharmacist/designee.  
The investigator must ensure that the IMP is used only in accordance with the protocol.  
Periodically, and/or after com pletion of the clinical phase of the study, all used (including empty 
containers) and unused IMP containers must be reconciled and returned to UCB’s designee, 
preferably in their original package. The IMP intended for the study cannot be used for any other  
purpose than that described in this protocol.  
7.[ADDRESS_1004175]’s presence in  order to obtain 
explanations regarding discrepancies in compliance with the dosing regimen. Drug 
accountability must be recorded on the Drug Accountability form.  
If a subject is found to be persistently noncompliant (defined as less than 75% or more than 
125% compliant with the dosage schedule), the sponsor, in conjunction with the investigator, 
will make a decision as to whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study.  
Timely completion of the subject diary is essential for evaluation of safety and  efficacy. Subject 
diary use will be confirmed at each visit and telephone contact.

may be carefully tapered and discontinued to achieve LCM monotherapy. New concomitant 
AEDs may be introduced as treatment if the medication has been approved by [CONTACT_734937]. New concomitant AEDs should be added 
only when the subject has not optimally or adequately responded to a maximum tolerated dose of 
LCM.  
Implantation of and changes in vagal nerve stimulation settings are permitted.  
The investigator must contact [CONTACT_734938]. In 
general, it is not necessary to discontinue LCM for subjects undergoing surgery, alt hough each 
case must be discussed on a case -by-case basis. The investigator must contact [CONTACT_734939] -starting LCM after a surgery.  
Therapy that becomes necessary, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], during the course of the study 
must not be r efused to a subject, even if described above as a therapy that is expressly not 
permitted in the frame of this study. The subject's participation in this study may be discontinued 
in such a case.  
7.9 Blinding  
EP0034 is an open -label study; thus, there will be no blinding.  
7.10 Randomization and numbering of subjects  
Subjects will not be randomized in this study. The same unique 5 -digit identification number 
used in the primary study (ie, SP0967 or SP0969) will be used in EP0034. This subject number 
will be used to i dentify the subject throughout the study and to maintain subject confidentiality.

8 STUDY  PROCEDURES BY [CONTACT_734940] 5.2.  
A time window of ±[ADDRESS_1004176] should take the morning LCM dose at the usual time.  
At all visits and telephone contacts, subjects will b e instructed to call the investigator if any 
intolerable and/or serious AEs occur before the next visit or contact.  
Subjects will be required to have a 12 -lead ECG (2 interpretable recordings approximately 20 to 
30 minutes apart) conducted at LCM maximum p lasma concentration (C max) 1 week after a LCM 
dose increase to ≥8mg/kg/day, after subsequent dose increases (ie, the first time a subject reaches 
a LCM dose of 8mg/kg/day, 9mg/kg/day, 10mg/kg/day, etc) or for LCM doses of ≥400mg/day 
(ie, the first time a s ubject reaches a LCM dose of 400mg/day, 500mg/day, etc), or when a new 
concomitant AED is introduced during the study. This ECG can be conducted at an Unscheduled 
Visit (Section 8.5), if necessary. Subjects having a LCM dose increase to ≥8mg/kg/day or to 
≥400mg/day, or when a new concomitant AED is added will be required to arrive at the clinic 
prior to taking their morning dose of LCM. Subjects will b e administered their morning LCM 
dose by [CONTACT_207258] (2 interpretable recordings approximately 
20 to 30  minutes apart prior to any blood sample collection or vital signs assessment) can be 
performed 30  minutes to 1 hour aft er the administration of LCM.  
The PedsQL, the Achenbach CBCL, and the BRIEF -P and BRIEF will only be administered in 
countries where a validated translated version is available. The Bayley -III scales should be 
completed only for subjects enrolled in Engli sh-speaking countries.  
8.1 Treatment Period  
8.1.1  Visit 1 (Week 0)  
For subjects completing the Transition Period of the primary studies and choosing to enroll in 
EP0034, the final Transition Visit (Transition Visit 4 in SP0969 and Final Transition Visit in 
SP0967) w ill serve as Visit 1 of EP0034. At Visit 1 (Week 0), prior to the conduct of any 
study -related procedures, a complete explanation (both verbal and written) of the nature and 
purpose of the study will be given to the subject (when possible or as required ac cording to local 
IRBs/IECs) and the subject’s legal representative(s) by [CONTACT_093] (or designee). The 
subject’s parent/legal guardian will be requested to sign and date the IRB/IEC -approved ICF. 
When possible, or as required by [CONTACT_1036]/IEC, th e subject will be requested to give assent 
to participate in the study.  
The subject’s eligibility for the study will be determined at Visit 1 on the basis of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, signature [CONTACT_734960] -related procedures or 
evaluations, and the results of the assessments listed below (for further details of the assessments 
and the required procedures and methods, please refer to Section 9 and Section 10 of this

If a subject needs to be discontinued and cannot come into the clinic, then appropriate tapering 
instructions will be provided, and a visit will be scheduled to perform safety assessments as so on 
as possible.  
In situations where a subject is unable to return to the study site, investigators will assess and 
document the subject’s safety via telephone contact. Based on information gathered from the 
telephone contact, investigators will confirm whe ther the subject could continue the current 
study treatment based upon the outcome of the safety assessments. Subjects’ agreement to 
implement this procedure should be obtained and documented prior to implementing any 
changes. Changes in the study treatmen t supply in this situation are described in Section  7.2.[ADDRESS_1004201] visits another facility for a medical issue (or has to switch sites for a COV ID-19-

9.2 Global Impression of Change  
The Clinical and Caregiver’s Global Impression of Change w ill be administered according to the 
tabular schedules of study procedures (Section 5.2). 
The Clinical Global Impression of Change is a [ADDRESS_1004203]’s change from Baseline in clinical status, including an 
evaluation of seizure frequency and intensity, the occurrence of AEs, and subject’s functional 
status.

The PedsQL will be administered according to the tabular sch edules of study procedures 
(Section 5.2). The PedsQL will only be administered in countries where a validated translated 
version is available.  
The Pe dsQL measurement model consists of developmentally appropriate forms for pediatric 
subjects 1 month to 12 months, 13 months to 24 months, 2 years to 4 years, 5 years to 7 years, 8 
years to 12 years, and 13 years to 18  years of age. Self -report is measured for pediatric subjects

10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
10.1 Adverse events  
10.1.1  Definition of adverse event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administ ered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with th e 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
In order to ensure complete safety data collection, all AEs occurring during the study (ie,  after 
the signing of the ICF), including any pret reatment and posttreatment periods required by [CONTACT_12695], must be reported in the eCRF even if no investigational product was taken but specific 
study procedures were conducted. This includes all AEs not present prior to the initial visit and 
all AEs th at recurred or worsened after the initial visit. For results disclosure, only TEAEs are 
applicable.  
Signs or symptoms of the condition/disease for which  the investigational product is being studied 
should be recorded as AEs only if their nature changes co nsiderably or their frequency or 
intensity increases in a clinically significant manner as compared to the clinical profile known to 
the investigator from the subject’s history or the Baseline Period.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1004206]’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal representative(s) will be given the 
opportunity to report AEs spontaneously. A general prompt will also be given at each study visit 
to detect AEs. For example:  
“Did you notice anything unusual about you r health (since your last visit)?”  
In addition, the investigator should review any self -assessment procedures (eg,  diary cards) 
employed in the study.

resolution/stable level of sequelae is achieved, or until the investigator no longer deems that it is 
clinically significant, or until the subject is lost to follow up. If no follow up is provided, the 
investigator must provide a justif ication. The follow up will usually be continued for [ADDRESS_1004209] has discontinued his/her IMP.  
10.1.5  Rule for repetition of an adverse event  
An increase in the intensity of an AE should lead to the repetition of the AE being reported with:  
• The outc ome date of the first AE that is not related to the natural course of the disease being 
the same as the start date of the repeated AE, and the outcome of “worsening”  
• The AE verbatim term being the same for the first and repeated AE, so that the repeated AE  
can be easily identified as the worsening of the first one

department should be informed immediately. The subject should be withdrawn from the study as 
soon as  pregnancy is known, and the following should be completed:  
• The subject should return for an Early Termination Visit.  
• The subject should immediately stop the intake of the IMP or be down -titrated as instructed 
at the Early Termination Visit.  
• A Safety Foll ow-Up Visit should be scheduled 2 weeks (±2 days) after the subject has 
discontinued IMP.  
The investigator must inform the subject of information currently known about potential risks 
and about available treatment alternatives.  
In cases where the partner o f a male subject enrolled in a clinical study becomes pregnant, UCB 
will ask the investigator or designee to contact [CONTACT_734947]. If the partner agrees to provide additional informat ion, the 
Pregnancy Report and Outcome form will be forwarded to the subject’s partner for completion.  
The pregnancy will be documented on the Pregnancy Report and Outcome form provided to the 
investigator. The progression of the pregnancy and the eventual birth (if applicable) must be 
followed -up using the Pregnancy Report and Outcome form in which the investigator has to 
report on the health of the mother and of the child. The health of the child must be followed for

A pregnancy becomes an SAE in the following circumstances: miscarriage, abortion, or 
anomaly/birth defect of the child. Those SAEs must  be additionally reported using the 
Investigator SAE Report form.  
10.1.7  Overdose of IMP  
Excessive dosing (beyond that prescribed in the protocol and including overdose) should be 
recorded in the Drug Accountability or Study Drug Dosing module of the eCRF. Any SA E or 
nonserious AE associated with excessive dosing must be followed as any other SAE or 
nonserious AE. These events are only considered AEs or SAEs if there are associated clinical 
signs and symptoms or if the act of taking the excess medicine itself is a n AE or SAE 
(eg, suicide attempt).  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1004212] as early as possible any 
safety concern(s) related to the IMP so that investigators, clinical study subjects, regulatory 
author ities, and IRBs/IECs will be informed appropriately and as early as possible.  
The Study Physician or medically qualified designee/equivalent will conduct an ongoing review 
of SAEs and perform ongoing SAE reconciliations in collaboration with the Drug Safet y 
representative.  
As appropriate for the stage of development and accumulated experience with the IMP, 
medically qualified personnel at UCB may identify additional safety measures (eg,  AEs, vital 
signs, laboratory or ECG results) for which data will be per iodically reviewed during the course 
of the study.  
10.1.9  Occurrence of COVID -19 
Occurrence of COVID -19 in subjects should be reported as either “suspected COVID -19” or 
“confirmed COVID -19” along with all available relevant data including diagnostic and 
laborator y data. For subjects where COVID -[ADDRESS_1004213], 
please report as “suspected COVID -19” and provide relevant data to support the diagnosis as 
well as the test results.

patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition of serious  
(Important medical events may include but are not limited to, potential Hy’s Law [see 
Section  10.3], allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasias that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the developme nt 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.)  
• Initial inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
(A patient admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], even if he/she is released on the same day, meets the

admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58912]. 
However, emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_352178], instead , should be evaluated for 1 of the other criteria in the 
definition of serious [eg,  life-threatening adverse experience, important medical event].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58913] [eg,  preplanned 
surgery or elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened or manifested 
in an unusual or uncharacteristic manner] do not qualify for reporting. For example, if a 
subject has a condition recorded on his/her medical history and later has a preplanned surger y 
for this condition, it is not appropriate to record the surgery or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18256], 
since there is no AE upon which to assess the serious criteria. Please note that, if the 
pre-existing condition has worsened or manifested in an unusual or unch aracteristic manner, 
this would then qualify as an AE and, if necessary, the seriousness of the event would need to 
be determined.)  
10.2.[ADDRESS_1004215] be informed within 24 hours of receipt of th is information by 
[CONTACT_779] (see contact [CONTACT_67596]). The investigator must forward to UCB (or its representative) 
a duly completed “Investigator SAE Repor t Form for Development Drug” (SAE report form) 
provided by [CONTACT_18338], even if the data are incomplete, or if it is obvious that more data will be 
needed in order to draw any conclusions. Information recorded on this form will be entered into 
the global safety da tabase.  
An Investigator SAE report form will be provided to the investigator. The Investigator SAE 
report form must be completed in English.  
It is important for the investigator, when completing the SAE report form, to include the 
assessment as to a causa l relationship between the SAE and the IMP administration. This insight 
from the investigator is very important for UCB to consider in assessing the safety of the IMP 
and in determining whether the SAE requires reporting to the regulatory authorities in an  
expedited manner.  
Additional information (eg,  autopsy or laboratory reports) received by [CONTACT_67597] [ADDRESS_1004216] and report to UCB (or its representative) any 
SAEs (even if the investigator is certain that they are in no way associ ated with the IMP), up to 
[ADDRESS_1004217] be reported to UCB regardless of the 
time between the event and the end of the study.  
Upon receipt of the SAE report form, UCB will perform an assessment of expectedness of the 
reported SAE. The assessment of the expectedness of the SAE is based  on the Investigator’s

10.6.1  Liver function tests and evaluation of PDILI  
The PDILI IMP discontinuation criteria for this study are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , with the 
accompanying required follow -up investigation and monitoring detailed below. All PDILI events 
must be reported as an AE and reported to the study site an d sponsor within 24 hours of learning 
of their occurrence. Any PDILI event that meets the criterion for potential Hy’s Law must be 
reported as an AE of special interest (see Section  10.3), and, if applicable, also reported as an 
SAE (see Section 10.2).  
Evaluation of PDILI consists of the diagno stic testing and continued monitoring included in 
Table  10‒3 (specific tests dependent on laboratory results and corresponding symptoms) and 
consultatio n with a local hepatologist (if applicable; discussed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). The local

UCB   [ADDRESS_1004223]. Additional investigation and monitoring may be required and adapted based 
on the diagnosis after the cause of the liv er injury/abnormality is confirmed (details in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
The results of all monitoring, including laboratory testing and other testing, sho uld be made 
available to the study site and sponsor.  
All initial tests resulting in abnormal hepatic laboratory values need to be repeated, but 
appropriate medical action must not be delayed waiting for the repeat result.  
If tests are done locally for more  rapid results, a concurrent sample should also be sent to the 
central laboratory whenever possible. Medical care decisions are to be made initially using the 
most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_58916] a conservative approach must be taken if the results from the 
2 laboratory tests are significantly different. Data from the local and central laboratory are to be 
recorded on the applicable eCRF pages.  
When IMP is discontinued, all concomitant medications and herbal supplements that are not 
medically necessary should  also be discontinued. In these cases, the investigator should also 
consider dose reduction for medically necessary concomitant medication and consider changing 
any medically required concomitant medication known to be hepatotoxic to a suitable 
alternative . 
When IMP is stopped due to PDILI (as described in Section 6.3.1 ), IMP must be permanently 
discontinued unless a subsequent alternative diagnosis fu lly explains the hepatic findings. 
Rechallenge with a substance potentially causing drug -induced liver injury is dangerous, may be 
fatal, and must not occur.  
Table  10‒3 below summarizes the approach to investigate PDILI.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Consultation with Medical Monitor and local hepatologist  
Potential drug -induced liver injury events require notificat ion of the Medical Monitor within 
24 hours (eg, by [CONTACT_58980]), and the subject must be discussed with the Medical Monitor as 
soon as possible. If required, the subject must also be discussed with the local hepatologist. The 
local hepatologist is the  expert usually consulted by [CONTACT_58979]. This would usually be a hepatologist, but may be a 
gastroenterologist. If determined necessary, this discussion should be followed by a full 
hepatology assessment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and SAE report (if applicable).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immediate action: determination of IMP discontinuation  
All PDILI events re quire immediate action, testing, and monitoring.  
The immediate action is dependent on the laboratory values and symptoms of hepatitis or 
hypersensitivity and ranges from continuation of IMP (followed by [CONTACT_58984]) to 
immediate and permanent d iscontinuation (see Section 6.3.1  and Table  10‒3 for details).  
When IMP is discontinued, all concomitant medications and herbal supplements that are not 
medically necessary should also be discontinued. The investigator should also consider dose 
reduction for medically necessary concomitant medicatio n and consider changing any medically 
required concomitant medication known to be hepatotoxic to a suitable alternative.

The measurements and additional information required for the assessment of PD ILI events when 
there is a reasonable possibility  that they may have been caused by [CONTACT_67603]  10‒4 (laboratory measurements) and Table  10‒5 (additional information). Results of the 
laboratory measurements and information collected are to be submitted to the sponsor on the 
corresponding eCRF. If the medical history of the subject indicates a requirement for other 
assessments not included below, these additional assessments should be compl eted and 
submitted, as applicable.  
All blood samples should be stored, if possible. If tests are done locally for more rapid results, a 
concurrent sample must also be sent to the central laboratory.

3 minutes after standing up, as feasible.  
Body weight will be determined without shoes and wearing light clothing, and height will be 
measured without shoes. Body weight and height will be assessed according to the tabular 
schedu les of study procedures (Section 5.2). 
10.8.6  Assessment of suicidality  
Suicidality will be assessed by [CONTACT_207276] C -SSRS (Columbia University 
Medical Center, 2008). This scale will be used for subject’s eligibility for the study as well as to 
assess suicidal ideation and behavior that may occur during the study.  
The C -SSRS will be completed according to the tabular schedules of study  procedures 
(Section  5.2). This scale will be completed for subjects ≥6  years of age. The “Since Last Visit” 
version of the C -SSRS should be used. I f a subject becomes 6 years of age during the study, the

6 years of age and the “Since Last Visit” version at subsequent visits.  
The C -SSRS is not validated for subjects <6 years of age and will not be used for this population. 
Subjects should be monitored for any changes in mood, ideas, or behavior for warning signs of 
depression. The investigator should be aware of common warning signs that might be a signal  for 
risk of depression. For common signs and symptoms of depression in children younger than 
6 years old, reference should be made to the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders. Parents and caregivers should also be a dvised accordingly and 
effort should be made at clinic visits to specifically assess potential depression.  
10.8.7  Achenbach CBCL  
The Achenbach CBCL is a widely used validated questionnaire to evaluate a child’s 
competencies and behavioral/emotional problems. Behavioral problems will be scored by [CONTACT_31588](s)/legal representative(s).  
Depending on the subject’s age, 2 versions of th e Achenbach CBCL will be used. The 
CBCL/1½ -[ADDRESS_1004230] is intended for use in children 18 months to 5 years and 11  months of age 
(Achenbach and Rescorla, 2000). For subjects ≥6 years to <17 years of age, the CBCL/6 -18 
version will be used (Achenbach and Re scorla, 2001). The version of the Achenbach CBCL 
appropriate to each subject’s age should be administered with the following exception: For 
subjects who completed the CBCL/1½ -5 at the Baseline assessment of the previous study and 
turn 6  years of age within  1 year after the Baseline assessment of the primary study, the 
CBCL/1½ -5 should be completed for 1 year after the Baseline assessment of the primary study, 
and subsequently the CBCL/6 -18 should be completed. The Achenbach CBCL will only be 
administered in  countries where a validated translated version is available.  
The Achenbach CBCL will be completed according to the tabular schedules of study procedures 
(Section 5.2). The completion of the Achenbach CBCL will require approximately [ADDRESS_1004231] 6 months 
will be scored on the following scale:  
• 0=not true (as far as kno wn) 
• 1=somewhat or sometimes true  
• 2=very true or often true  
Eight syndrome scores will be calculated from these questions, which will in turn be summarized 
by 2 composite scores. Additionally, for each score on the question, syndrome, and total level, 
categ orizations based on a normative sample will be used to evaluate normal, borderline, or 
clinically relevant behavior.  
In addition, the CBCL/6 -18 includes ratings related to performance in school, activities in leisure 
time, and special interests.  
10.8.8  BRIEF -P an d BRIEF  
The BRIEF -P and the BRIEF are validated tools that will be used for the evaluation of subjects 
≥2 years to <5 years of age and ≥5 years of age, respectively (Gioia et al, 2000). The BRIEF -P or 
BRIEF appropriate for each subject’s age should be comp leted, with the following exception:

turn 5 years of age within 1 year after the Baseline assessment of the primary study, the BRIEF -P 
should be completed for 1 yea r after the Baseline assessment of the primary study, and 
subsequently the BRIEF should be completed. The BRIEF -P and BRIEF will be administered 
according to the tabular schedules of study procedures (Section 5.2). The BRIEF -P and BRIEF 
will only be administered in countries where a validated translated version is available.  
The BRIEF -P and BRIEF include rating forms used by [CONTACT_67607] ’ executive 
functioning. Executive functions broadly encompass a set of cognitive skills that are responsible 
for the planning, initiation, sequencing, and monitoring of complex goal -directed behavior. The 
BRIEF -P rating form consists of items that measure  various aspects of executive functioning: 
Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Working Memory, and Plan/Organize. The clinical scales form 
[ADDRESS_1004232] indexes (Inhibitory Self -Control, Flexibility, and Emergent Metacognition) and 
1 composite score (Global Execu tive Composite).  
The BRIEF rating form contains items in nonoverlappi[INVESTIGATOR_207235]. These theoretically and 
statistically derived scales form 2 broader indexes: Behavioral Regulation (3 scales) and 
Metacognition (5 scales), as well as a Global Executi ve Composite score.  
Both the BRIEF -P and the BRIEF include validity scales to measure negativity and 
inconsistency of responses.

developmental assessment instruments (Sattler and Hoge, 2006) used to examine the major 
facets of a young child’s development (Bayley, 2006). The Bayley -III scales are a standardized, 
individually administered, adaptive assessment tha t measures the developmental functioning of 
infants and young pediatric subjects from 1 month to 42 months of age (Bayley, 2006). The 
Bayley -III scales measure cognitive, language, motor, social -emotional, and adaptive 
development and are a revision of the  predecessor, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 
Second Edition (Bayley, 1993). The Bayley -III scales are a technically sound instrument, with 
strong internal consistency, as well as test -retest stability. The Bayley -III scales are validated 
only in English.  
This scale is validated as a tool for assessment of neurological development in young pediatric 
subjects and is therefore considered appropriate for EP0034.  
The Bayley -III scales are an individually administered, adaptive assessment that present s 
pediatric subjects with situations and tasks designed to produce an observable set of behavioral 
responses. They consist of a cognitive scale, a language composite scale with receptive and 
expressive language subscales, and a motor composite scale with f ine and gross motor subscales 
to be completed by [CONTACT_1719]. It also has a social emotional scale, comprising 
social -emotional competence, and sensory processing, and an adaptive behavior scale, which 
assesses the attainment of skills nec essary for the development of independence, to be completed 
by [CONTACT_2252]’s parent or caregiver.  
The completion of the Bayley -III scales will require approximately 50 minutes for pediatric 
subjects who are 12 months old or younger and 90 minutes for pediat ric subjects aged 12 months 
to 18 months.

12 STATISTICS  
A description of statistical methods follows and will be described in more detail in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
12.1 Definition of analysis sets  
Analysis sets will be defined as follows:  
• The Safety Set (SS) will consist of all enrolled subjects who took at least 1 dose of LCM in 
this long -term study. All safety analyses will be performed on the SS.  
• The Full Analysis Set wil l be used for the analysis of seizure data and will consist of all 
subjects in the SS, who have at least [ADDRESS_1004244] deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. No statistical hypothesis 
testing will be performed. Baseline values for safety and efficacy variables will be determined 
from Baseline values of the primary study.  
Further methods pertaining to the summary and analysis of the efficacy and safety data are 
presented in the following sections, and will be described in more detail in the SAP.  
12.[ADDRESS_1004245] d ose of LCM 
will be considered treatment emergent. Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_529475], 3 -month period, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA®) Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term in  incidence tables. 
Separate tables will be provided by [CONTACT_734951].  
The safety variables such as changes in ECG, vital signs, laboratory parameters, height, body 
weight meas urements, and Tanner Stage scores will be analyzed descriptively. The results for 
occurrence of these variables during long -term treatment will be summarized overall, and by 
[CONTACT_765]. Subjects will be grouped by [CONTACT_734952]. The procedure for gr oupi[INVESTIGATOR_734914].
UCB   [ADDRESS_1004246] -Baseline status when compared to 
their Baseline status.  
Changes from Baseline in laboratory,  ECG, and vital sign values will be tabulated. In addition, 
physical and neurological examination abnormalities will be listed by [CONTACT_765]. Markedly abnormal 
values will be summarized descriptively for laboratory, vital sign, body weight, and ECG 
parameters.  
Achenbach CBCL scores, BRIEF/BRIEF -P scores, and Bayley -III scores and the respective 
change from primary LCM study Baseline scores will be analyzed in a descriptive manner.  
12.[ADDRESS_1004247] diaries, which include type, date, and number of seizures.  
Descriptive statistics will also be presented for the Clinical and Caregiver’s Global Impression of 
Change, PedsQL  scores, and the number of health care resources used (concomitant medications, 
medical procedures, and health care provider consultations including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67563]).  
12.[ADDRESS_1004248] been e ntered and queries addressed, and prior to locking the clinical 
database, a data evaluation meeting (DEM) will be held. The purpose of this DEM will be to 
assess the quality of the data for subsequent database lock, identify protocol deviations, and 
finali ze analysis sets.  
12.6 Handling of dropouts or missing data  
No imputation of missing values for analysis parameters is planned unless otherwise noted. 
Imputations for missing or partial values for dates for AEs and concomitant medications will be 
applied to det ermine if an event is to be considered treatment emergent or concomitant. Across 
safety and efficacy analyses, only reported data will be used in each analysis time interval.  
Protocol deviations (eg, missing assessments or visits) related to COVID -19 will be documented.  
12.7 Planned interim analysis and data monitoring  
No formal interim analysis or Data Monitoring Committee is planned. However, data may be 
reported prior to the completion of this study to support annual reports, regulatory submissions, 
and publications.  
12.8 Determination of sample size  
Approximately 500 subjects from the SP0967 and the SP0969 study will be eligible to enroll in 
this open -label extension study. No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted in this study; 
therefore, no formal sam ple size calculations have been performed.

Before initiating a study, the investigator will have written and dated full approval from the 
responsible IRB/IEC for the protocol.  
The investigator will also promptly report to the IRB/IEC all changes in the study, all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others, and any protocol deviations, 
to eliminate immediate h azards to subjects.  
The investigator will not make any changes in the study or study conduct without IRB/IEC 
approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. For 
minor changes to a previously approved protocol durin g the period covered by [CONTACT_18424], it may be possible for the investigator to obtain an expedited review by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC as 
allowed.  
As part of the IRB/IEC requirements for continuing review of approved studies, the investigator 
will be responsi ble for submitting periodic progress reports to the IRB/IEC (based on IRB/IEC 
requirements), at intervals appropriate to the degree of subject risk involved, but no less than 
once per year. The investigator should provide a final report to the IRB/IEC foll owing study 
completion.  
UCB (or its representative) will communicate safety information to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities and all active investigators in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
The appropriate IRB/IEC will also be infor med by [CONTACT_8893], as specified by

Confidential  Page 88 of 145 16 APPENDICES  
16.1 Protocol Amendment 1  
Rationale for the amendment  
The primary purpose of this substantial amendment is to add further clarification regarding the 
addition of extra procedures (ECGs) in case of LCM dose increases to ≥8mg/kg/day and 
≥400mg/day in accordance with the FDA request and based on program specific  guidelines. 
Furthermore, at the request of the Spanish IEC, additional inclusion criteria (Inclusion Criterion 
#5 and #6) were added to clarify age and diagnosis requirements for enrollment.  
Additional changes have been implemented for consistency with o ther protocols in the LCM 
pediatric program.  
Furthermore, administrative changes including the update of the study team and minor 
corrections, and update of the Sponsor Declaration for electronic signature, have been made.  
 
Modifications and changes  
Globa l changes  
The following changes were made throughout the protocol:  
• Text has been added to clarify the extra ECG assessments related to LCM dose increases of 
≥8mg/kg/day and ≥400mg/day, respectively.  
• Inclusion Criterion #5 has been added to clarify the enro llment requirements for age of 
subjects (1 month to ≤17  years).  
• Inclusion Criterion #6 has been added to clarify the enrollment requirements for diagnosis of 
subjects (epi[INVESTIGATOR_67530] -onset seizures).  
• Text has been modified to clarify that the C -SSRS  needs to be completed at an Unscheduled 
Visit if the visit is scheduled due to safety or efficacy reasons.  
• Text has been added to clarify which C -SSRS versions to use if a subject becomes 6 years of 
age (at that specific visit and all subsequent visits).  
• Text has been updated to clarify protocol adherence.  
• Efficacy variables have been added.  
• Text has been modified to clarify the handling of dropouts or missing data.  
• Exclusion Criterion #2 has been amended and Exclusion Criterion #4 has been deleted to 
clarify that subjects are excluded if they meet the mandatory withdrawal criteria for SP0967 
or SP0969.  
• Text has been added to clarify that the subject’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal representative(s) 
are also given the opportunity to report AEs spontaneousl y.

collect urine (in an appropriate container).  
• Text has been adde d to clarify that implantation of and changes in vagal nerve stimulation 
settings are permitted.  
• For subjects choosing to enroll in EP0034 from SP0969, the final Transition Visit, which will 
serve as Visit 1 of EP0034, has been corrected from Transition V isit 3 to Transition Visit 4.  
• Text has been corrected to clarify that the LCM doses will be divided between the morning 
and the evening dose (but not equally divided).  
• Text has been modified to correct the duration of the Taper Period from 6 weeks to 4 we eks.  
• The Sponsor Study Physician, Clinical Project Manager, and Clinical Trial Biostatistician 
have changed and their contact [CONTACT_8972], as well as those of the Clinical Monitoring Research 
Organization, have been updated.  
• The Sponsor Declaration has been updated for electronic signature.  
• Other changes made in this amendment are to provide clarification, are administrative in 
nature, or are to correct errors.

  16.2 Protocol Amendment 2  
The primary purposes of this substantial amendment are to allow administration of the Pediatric 
Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) to subjects under 2  years of age and to implement language 
regarding potential drug -induced liver injury (PDILI) events, base d on new standard language 
which is being applied across all protocols at UCB.  Addition of this language is to align with 
FDA guidance regarding monitoring of PDILI events and does not reflect a change in the liver 
safety signal for LCM.  
 
Modifications a nd changes  
Global changes  
The following changes were made throughout the protocol:  
• The PedsQL measurement model text was updated so it consists of developmentally 
appropriate forms for pediatric subjects ≥1 month to ≤12 months, ≥13 months to <24  months.  
• To update the protocol information pertaining to PDILI monitoring in the exclusion criteria, 
withdrawal criteria, adverse events of special interest, and assessment of safety.  
• Minor editorial changes have been made throughout the protocol.

  • ALT or AST ≥5xULN  
• ALT or AST ≥3xULN and coexisting total bilirubin ≥2xULN  
The PDILI criterion below requires immediate discontinuation of IMP:  
• Subjects with ALT or AST ≥3xULN who exhibit temporally associated symptoms of 
hepatitis or hypersensitivity. Hepatitis symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tende rness. Hypersensitivity symptoms include fever (without clear 
alternative cause), rash, or eosinophilia (ie, >5%).  
The PDILI criterion below allows for subjects to continue on IMP at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
• Subjects with ALT or AST ≥3xULN (and ≥2x Baseline), and <5xULN,  total bilirubin 
<2xULN, and no eosinophilia (ie, ≤5%), with no fever, rash, or symptoms of hepatitis (eg, 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness)  
Evaluation of PDILI must be initiated as described in Section 10.6.1. If subjects are unable to 
comply with the applicable monitoring schedule, IMP must be discontinued immediately.  
Investigators should attempt to obtain information on subjects in the case of IMP discontinuation 
to complete the final evaluati on. Subjects with PDILI should not be withdrawn from the study 
until investigation and monitoring are complete. All results of these evaluations and 
observations, as well as the reason(s) for IMP discontinuation and subject withdrawal (if 
applicable), must  be recorded in the source documents. The eCRF must document the primary 
reason for IMP discontinuation.

Section 10.6.1  Liver function tests and evaluation of PDILI  
The PDILI IMP discontinuation criteria for this study are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS], with the 
accompanying required follow -up investigatio n and monitoring detailed below. All PDILI events 
must be reported as an AE and reported to the study site and sponsor within 24 hours of learning 
of their occurrence. Any PDILI event that meets the criterion for potential Hy’s Law must be

UCB   [ADDRESS_1004304] (see Section10.3), and, if applicable, also reported as an 
SAE (see Section 10.2).  
Evaluation of PDILI consists of the diagnostic testing and continued monitoring included in 
Table 10‒3 (specific tests dependent on laboratory results  and corresponding symptoms) and 
consultation with a local hepatologist (if applicable; discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The local 
hepatologist is the expert usually consulted by [CONTACT_734954]. This would usually be a hepatologist, but may be a 
gastroenterologist. Additional investigation and monitoring may be required and adapted based 
on the diagnosis after the cause of the liver injury/abnormality is confirmed (details in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ).  
The results of all monitoring, including laboratory testing and other testing, should be made 
available to the study site and sponsor.  
All initial tests resulting in abnormal hepatic laboratory values need to be repeated, but 
appropriate medical action  must not be delayed waiting for the repeat result.  
If tests are done locally for more rapid results, a concurrent sample should also be sent to the 
central laboratory whenever possible. Medical care decisions are to be made initially using the 
most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y available results and a conservative approach must be taken if the results from the 2 
laboratory tests are significantly different. Data from the local and central laboratory are to be 
recorded on the applicable eCRF pages.  
When IMP is discontinued, all concomitant medications and herbal supplements that are not 
medically necessary should also be discontinued. In these cases, the investigator should also 
consider dose reduction for medically necessary concomitant medication and consider changing 
any medic ally required concomitant medication known to be hepatotoxic to a suitable 
alternative.  
When IMP is stopped due to PDILI (as described in Section 6.3.1), IMP must be permanently 
discontinued unless a subsequent alternative diagnosis fully explains the hepatic findings. 
Rechallenge with a substance potentially causing drug -induced liver injury is dangerous, may be 
fatal, and must not occur.  
Table 10‒3 below summarizes the approach to investigate PDILI.

  [IP_ADDRESS] Consultation with Medical Monitor and local hepatologist  
Potential drug -induced liver injury events require notificatio n of the Medical Monitor within 
24 hours (eg, by [CONTACT_58980]), and the subject must be discussed with the Medical Monitor as 
soon as possible. If required, the subject must also be discussed with the local hepatologist. The 
local hepatologist is the e xpert usually consulted by [CONTACT_58979]. This would usually be a hepatologist, but may be a 
gastroenterologist. If determined necessary, this discussion should be followed by a full 
hepat ology assessment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and SAE report (if applicable).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immediate action: determination of IMP discontinuation  
All PDILI events require immediate action, testing, and monitoring.  
The immediate action is dependent on the laboratory values and symptoms of hepatitis or 
hypersensitivity and ranges from continuation of IMP (followed by [CONTACT_58984]) to 
immediate and pe rmanent discontinuation (see Section 6.3.1  and Table  10‒3 for details).  
When IMP is discontinued, all concomitant medications and herbal supplements that are not 
medically necessary should also be discontinued. The investigator should also consider dose 
reduction for medically necessary concomitant  medication and consider changing any medically 
required concomitant medication known to be hepatotoxic to a suitable alternative.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Testing: identification/exclusion of alternative etiology  
The measurements and additional information required for t he assessment of PDILI events when 
there is a reasonable possibility  that they may have been caused by [CONTACT_67603]  10‒4 (laboratory measurements) and Table  10‒5 (additional information). Results of the 
laboratory measurements and information collected are to be submitte d to the sponsor on the 
corresponding eCRF. If the medical history of the subject indicates a requirement for other 
assessments not included below, these additional assessments should be completed and 
submitted, as applicable.  
All blood samples should be stored, if possible. If tests are done locally for more rapid results, a 
concurrent sample must also be sent to the central laboratory.  
The following measurements are to be assessed:

UCB   [ADDRESS_1004318] may be warranted  to understand the curre nt health status of the subjects, 
to follow up on AEs, and inform them of any protective measures taken by [CONTACT_207265] a 
result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic (eg, any measures that may limit 
access to the site or may require  additional actions by [CONTACT_734945]).  
If a subject needs to be discontinued and cannot come into the clinic, then appropriate tapering 
instructions will be provided, and a visit will be scheduled to perform safety assessments as so on 
as possible.  
In situations where a subject is unable to return to the study site, investigators will assess and 
document the subject’s safety via telephone contact. Based on information gathered from the 
telephone contact, investigators will confirm whe ther the subject could continue the current 
study treatment based upon the outcome of the safety assessments. Subjects’ agreement to 
implement this procedure should be obtained and documented prior to implementing any 
changes. Changes in the study treatmen t supply in this situation are described in Section  7.2.[ADDRESS_1004319] visits another facility for a medical issue (or has to switch sites for a COV ID-19-
related reason), the investigator should request contact [CONTACT_207267] a detailed explanation of the subject’s condition and his/her participation in the clinical 
study. Subjects or caregivers shall be reminded to compl etely collect and keep records of this 
visit.  
Deviations to data collection including inability to perform some assessments, such as ECG, 
blood collection for safety laboratory assessments and PK, or alternative methods of assessment, 
such as phone calls,  should be recorded in the source documentation and notated as “not done” in 
the eCRF.  
In cases where subjects cannot return to the clinic, and it will not be possible to dispense a new 
seizure diary, subjects will be instructed to continue recording of se izures in a manner that is 
mutually agreed with the investigator (eg, hand -written notes, recording on a smart device). Any 
recording of seizures in a manner outside of the study seizure diary must be carefully 
documented in the source medical records (cop ies/print -screen printouts of these recordings will 
be brought to and retained at the site).

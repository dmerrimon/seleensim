A Novel Application of Exparel for Postoperative Pain Management in Shoulder 
Arthroplasty and Humerus Fracture Fixation  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
 
4/14/[ADDRESS_1117416] unique  postop erative goals for mobi lization and 
rehabilitation that are often limited by [CONTACT_77368]. Current pain management  schemes are subopti mal. 
liposom al bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  (Exparel) is a promising new agent, still untested in shoulder  arthroplas ty 
patients, and may improve outcom es such a s opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], pain control, patient satisfaction, and 
shoulde r function. This study aims to measure these outcom es in order to show th at Exparel is 
superior to continuous  interscalene block in reducing postope rative pain and healthcare cost and 
improving  functional outcomes  and pa tient satisfaction, which will hope fully lead to a 
widespread change in clinical practice for shoul der surgery. 
With the mount ing evidenc e that a liposom al bupi[INVESTIGATOR_117610] e-based multimodal  analgesic 
regimen results in statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d 
consumpt ion, short er length of stay and low er inpatient costs for  general surgery procedu res, it is 
important we examine its use in orthopaedics. The potential  benefits of liposom al bupi[INVESTIGATOR_808445] a wid espread shift in clinical practice for po stope rative pain 
management  after total joint replacement.  However, many providers are unconvinc ed regarding 
the potential utility and benefit of this  agent due to current lack of evidence in orthopaedics. 
Results from this study may show t hat liposomal  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_808446] d ecreased 
postope rative pain, decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d use, less c omplications and improve d patient satisfaction and 
shoulde r function in shoulder  arthroplas ty patients. If the hypothesis  is confirmed,  this study will 
promote  the use of liposom al bupi[INVESTIGATOR_117610] e-based multimodal analgesic regimen over continuous  
interscalene block as a method of postoperative pain control  for shoulde r arthroplas ty patients. 
 
HYPOTHESES& SPECIFIC AIM  
Hypothesis  – Liposomal  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_808447] d 
postope rative pain control, reduction in amount  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d suppl ement ation, decreased 
compl ications and quicke r return to function compa red to current standard of care pain 
management  for patients unde rgoing shoulde r arthroplas ty surgery. 
 
Speci fic Aim [ADDRESS_1117417] of care continuous 
peripheral  nerve cathet er in terms of postoperat ive pain control  after shoul der arthroplasty 
surger y. 
Speci fic Aim 2 
To evaluat e amount of  supple mental opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d usage  by [CONTACT_808456][INVESTIGATOR_808448] 
(CPN B) after shoul der arthroplasty  surgery. 
Speci fic Aim [ADDRESS_1117418] will be performed (for pr emenopa usal women  only), and concomitant 
medi cations and na rcotic usage will be recorded. Training on self-assessment  measures will also 
be conduc ted. Patients  meeting inclus ion criteria will be consented at prescreening visit for 
participation  in this study by a study coordina tor or PI. 
At baseline (1week prior to surgery) a physical examination, medi cal history, and pain 
assessment  using  a [ADDRESS_1117419] (NRS-R) and with  activity(NRS-A) will 
be collected.  Patients  will then be enroll ed and randomized into the study in one of two groups. 
All patients  will receive  standard of care preoperative analgesia. Preoperatively, the 
anesthesio logist will administer a 60mL single bolus brachial  plexus nerve block with 0.5% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_808449]. Patients in Group 1 will  also unde rgo cathe ter placement  at this time 
and continue to receive  continuous peripheral nerve block (CISB) with 0.125%  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_808450] a 
rate of 6 mL/hour  postop eratively, allowing for the maximum dose to be administered over [ADDRESS_1117420] of care general anesthesia  with appropriate 
intraoperative doses of fe ntanyl or analogs equiva lents. Patients in Group 2 will  receive  local 
tissue infiltration with liposom al bupi[INVESTIGATOR_808451]-operatively in addit ion to the previous ly 
administered single shot peripheral nerve block to cover early postope rative pain. The study 
medi cation will be diluted to the recom mended total volume of 60m L with 0.9% nor mal saline, 
and administered via recommended movi ng needle technique  during the surgical procedure. The 
study drug administration will be done  prior  to prosthet ic implant ation (36ml) and after 
prosthe tic implant ation (12mL into the capsul e and rotator cuff mus culatu re) and wound du ring 
closure  (12mL). The techniqu e used has been validated and de monstr ated success for total knee 
replacements  as well as case series for to tal shoulder  arthroplasty. 
Post-operatively, the patients will be  continued on ora l acetaminophen and ce lecoxib for 
[ADDRESS_1117421]-operat ively all patients will be  assesse d for pa in every 2 hou rs by [CONTACT_808457] (NRS-A, and NR S-R) for pain (0=no pain, 10= worst pain)  for the  first 
[ADDRESS_1117422] data includi ng 
pain scales, narcotic usage, patient satisfaction with postope rative anesthesia/p ain control, reason 
for not  using  medi cation, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d related side effects, catheter related side effects, and use of othe r 
pain control methods  from each consented participant  prospect ively, this data will be recorded 
using  a standardized outcomes  data collection form. Follow up postope rative assessments wi ll 
include  the above  pain scores and na rcotic usage logs as well as additional  stand ard functional 
outcome  assessments.  These assessments wi ll occur at [ADDRESS_1117423]-surgical anesthesia  at discharge, and time to resumpt ion 
of work or no rmal activities. Safety outcome  measures will include , vital signs, wound h ealing 
status,  neuropraxia, any adverse events (classifi ed as being related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110762],  or cathe ter), and pa tient responses r egarding  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_808452] , unplanne d 
medi cal visits or health related problems.  Short term functional assessme nts of shoulde r function 
will also be measur ed at follow up clinic visits ([ADDRESS_1117424]-operatively) and 
reported as secondary outcom es. These outcome  measures are all well described and validated 
for use  in out comes f ollowing  shoulde r surgery. The scores all assess the p atients’ subj ective 
quantification of pain and ability to complete  functional activities. The Const ant Score elaborates 
on thi s to include an obje ctive physician assessm ent of shoulder  range of motion and str ength. 
 
Statistical Anal ysis 
Power calculations for this study are based on previous  studi es utilizing liposom al

or chi-squared test as appropriat e. All doses of opi [INVESTIGATOR_808454]. Total narcotic consumpt ion and cumul ative pain scores will be calculated 
as the area under the curve (AUC) using  the trapezoidal  method. The total narcotic consum ption,

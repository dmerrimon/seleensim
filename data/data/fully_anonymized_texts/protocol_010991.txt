Abstract: 
Specific Aims: To access  the efficacy  of adding diphenhydramine as adjunct to improve sedation  
and to reduce the amount of standard sedatives  used during colonoscopy in patients  on chronic 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Background: Large number of colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_526663].  Use of Sedation  
increases  tolerance and improves outcomes.  With  increasing  use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_526664].  
Although effective,  these medications  have the potential to cause hypotension and respi[INVESTIGATOR_526665]. Diphenhydramine with its CNS  depressant effect can 
theoretically  provide synergistic effects.   We hypothesis use of diphenhydramine will decrease the 
amount of fentanyl and midazolam (versed) used during colonoscopy and will decrease the 
duration the procedure and the number adverse effects.  Methods: Patient on c hronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_526666] 50mg of diphenhydramine or 
placebo.  Amount of sedatives,  duration of procedure, adverse effect  and quality  of sedation  (nurse, 
physician  and patient)  will be recorded. Two-sided t-test will be used to compare the means  of

A. Specific  Aims
The primary  aim of our study is to determine  if addition  of Diphenhydramine to Fentanyl and 
Midazolam will decrease  the dose of Fentanyl and Midazolam (versed) used during colonoscopy 
in individuals  on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Secondarily  we will be looking at quality  of sedation,  duration 
of colonoscopy, time to reach  cecum and adverse effects  (hypoxia defined  as O2 saturation  less 
than 89% lasting  for more than 30 seconds,  Hypertension 20 mmhg  increase  in BP from baseline 
provided this is >140 systolic and 90 diastolic,  Hypotension 20 mmhg  decrease in BP from 
baseline provided this <100 systolic or 60 diastolic,  Bradycardia a decrease in HR of > 20 provided 
this is less than 60, Tachycardia a increase in HR of >20 provided this greater  than 100 and use of 
reversal agents  i.e Naloxone or Flumazenil).
B.Background and Significance 
According to an estimate more than [ADDRESS_683414] been  conflicting  factors  predictive of difficult sedation

vResults  of the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health  (NSDUH) showed that an estimated  
22.6 million  (8.9%) of Americans,  aged  [ADDRESS_683415] in  this challenging  population. 
C.Preliminary  Studies 
Study by [CONTACT_31409]  H et al showed addition  of diphenhydramine resulted  in 10.1% reduction  in 
meperidine and 13.7% reduction  in midazolam  dose. Sedation  scores significantly  favor 
Diphenhydramine. However, only 7/130 patients  in the diphenhydramine group were on chronic 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].

5Recruitment and  Consent:
Charts  of patients  scheduled  for colonoscopy at VA Medical Center  Oklahoma will be reviewed  
by [CONTACT_526668].  
Patients  will be consented  on the day of the procedure by [CONTACT_526669] a private  room. 
Day of Procedure:
After  consent is obtained  the medical records of the patients  will be reviewed  and demographic 
information, co-morbidities,  current medication  will be extracted  and recorded.
On the day of colonoscopy Alcohol use disorder inventory (AUDIT) will be used to screen  for 
alcohol abuse. AUDIT was developed  by [CONTACT_526670] 
a period of [ADDRESS_683417] of 10 questions, each question is scored 0-4 on the basis  of subjects  
alcohol use. It takes  about 2-4 minutes  to complete.  
Subjects  will be checked  in and prepared according  to routine protocols of the VA medical center.  
Participants  will be randomly assigned to receive  either  50 mg of diphenhydramine or 10 ml of 
0.9% sodium chloride.  On the day of colonoscopy randomization  will be performed by [CONTACT_526671] a pharmacist  at VA medical  center  using the website 
http://www.randomization.com . She will also prepare and dispense medication.  Each  endoscopy 
team will consist of an attending  gastroenterologist, two nurses either  with or without a 3rd year 
gastroenterology fellow.  Medications  will be administered  by [CONTACT_526672].
At the start of procedure baseline  vitals  will be recorded as per our unit’s policy.  Research  
medication  will be administered  within  [ADDRESS_683418] will be aware  of the contents  of 
IRB NUMBER: 3508

6the vial. Conscious sedation  will be achieved  using a combination  of intravenous midazolam 
(versed) and fentanyl as standard sedative.  During the procedure vital signs including  oxygen 
saturation  will be monitored  per standard operating  procedures of the endoscopy lab. Procedure 
related  complications,  including  hypotension, desaturation  and cardiac arrhythmia will be 
managed  according  to our endoscopy unit policy  and protocols.
Following the procedure, the nurse and the fellow  or the attending  will individually  rate the quality  
if sedation  on a Likert scale (optimal  sedation  score of 7). Qualitative assessment will also be made 
(Under-sedated, adequately  sedated,  or over-sedated).  
Recovery  time will be recorded. 
Day Following the Colonoscopy 
Twenty-four hour discharge a follow up call will be made and the patients  will be asked  to evaluate  
the level of pain (1, no pain; 10 severe pain), and amnesia (10, no memory  of the procedure; 1 
complete memory). 
E.Statistical Analysis 
Sample Size Calculation : Using a mean  dose of 94 mcg ± 29.1 for fentanyl (Robertson, DJ et al.) 
and considering a 15 mcg decrease in dose as significant a sample  size of 120 will give a power of 
80% at an  alpha of 0.05
SAS software (SAS Institute,  Cary,  NC, [LOCATION_003]) will be used for performance of data analyses.  
Continuous variables  will be reported as mean  ± SD and categorical variables  as percentages.  Two-
sided  t-test  will be used to compare  the means  of continuous variables  in the two groups 
IRB NUMBER: 3508
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/15/2017
7(diphenhydramine versus placebo),  and Chi-square test will be used to compare the categorical 
variables.  A P value < 0.05 will be considered statistically  significant.
F.Gender/Minority/Pediatric Inclusion for Research  
This protocol includes  all adult (over age 18) patients  who will be having a colonoscopy as  an 
outpatient.   No distinctions  based  on race or gender is  relevant.
G.Human Subjects
Criteria for inclusion  and exclusion  is described  are listed  above. 
After  obtaining  consent medical records will  be reviewed.  Data will be gathered  during and  after  
colonoscopy as  described  above. 
The patient  will be consent on the  day of procedure by a team  member  in a private setting.  
Information about the study will be provided over the phone in  advance and  a copy of consent 
will be mailed  to the identified  patients  for review  at least a week  prior to  the scheduled  
colonoscopy. A contact [CONTACT_526673]. 
Risk and side effects  related  to Diphenhydramine as  an adjunct to  sedation: <1%  (Limited  to 
important or life-threatening).  Side effects  include dry mouth, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_43706],  urinary 
retention,  constipation,  hallucinations  and delirium.  Most of these side effects  are temporary. QT 
prolongation leading  to cardiac  arrhythmia and  torsades de pontes is  extremely  rare.  xi Study by 
[CONTACT_31409]  H, et  al showed complication  rate was  not significantly  different between  patient  
receiving  (midazolam + meperidine + Placebo)  and   (Midazolam + meperidine + 
diphenhydramine). In addition  all complications  were mild.

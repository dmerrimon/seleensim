Using Urine Color as a marker of hydration status  
 
 
Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
The study protocol consists of a crossover design. During one arm the subjects will report euhydrated 
and then dehydrate 2% by [CONTACT_244261] a treadmill in the heat. During the second arm, subjects will report 
dehydrated after an overnight fast, and then rehy drate by [CONTACT_588739] 2 hours. Urine 
specific gravity, urine osmolality, subjective urine color and objective urine color (expressed in CIELab 
space) with be collected at the start and end of each arm of the study. Paired t -tests will be used  to 
determine if significant changes occur in each physiological variable during each of the 2 arms. Overall 
study significance will be set to p<0.05

Prospective single -blinded, controlled randomized clin ical trial with 2 -armed  
parallel -group sequential design  
D. Sample Size  
20 
E. Study  Duration  
13 months  
F. Study drug and Intervention  Description  
We will use CryoICE® CRYO2 cryoablation probes (AtriCure, Inc), which is 
an FDA -approved device for the use of intercostal nerve cryoablation.  
Subjects will be randomized into two groups:  
Group  A will receive  the study  procedure,  intercostal  nerve  cryoabla tion using 
CryoICE® CRYO2 cryoablation probes (AtriCure, Inc) to intercostal spaces 
4th to 10th in thoracoabdominal aortic repairs and 4th to 8th in descending 
thoracic aortic repair cases. This procedure will be performed under 
electromyography to confirm  the successful ablation of the  nerve.  
Group B will not receive cryoablation but will obtain electromyography to 
evaluate as the control.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/2019   
 Both patient groups will receive intraoperative local analgesia infiltration with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_101310] (Exparel®, Pacira 
Pharmacoceuticals) and patient -controlled analgesia (PCA) postoperatively.  
H Primary Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is to prove the feasibility of intercostal 
nerve cryoablation in postoperative pain control both in magnitude and 
duration in patients undergoing thoracoabdominal incisions for the 
descending or thoracoabdominal aortic an eurysm repair.  
I. Secondary  Objectives  
• To compare opi[INVESTIGATOR_101311].  
• To evaluate and compare patient participation in physical  therapy.  
• To evaluate and compare patient length of stay in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
• To evaluate cost -effectiveness of adding intercostal ne rve cryoablation to 
a postoperative pain control  regimen.  
 
VI. BACKGROUND AND  SIGNIFICANCE  
General Information  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101312]/thoracoabdominal aortic repair with thoracoabdomi nal incisions to have 
better control of postoperative pain management.  
 
Background Information  
In the [LOCATION_002], around 48 million inpatient surgical procedures were performed 
in 2009.1 Although pain is a predictable part of the postoperative experienc e 
(significant in up to 75% of patients),2,[ADDRESS_111843].4-6 Some studies show that the economic load of chronic pain that 
develops  from an acute  epi[INVESTIGATOR_101313] a 30 year-old patient  may be as much  as $1 
million over a lifetime.7 Lack of postoperative pain control may also result in deep  vein 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/2019   
 thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, coronary ischemia, myocardial infarction, 
pneumonia, poor wound healing, insomnia and demoralization.8,9 A number of drugs 
are available for postoperati ve pain control, such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], nonsteroidal anti - 
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), local anesthetic agents infiltration, as well as combined 
regimens  and protocols  among  them.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_101314]. Severe opi[INVESTIGATOR_101315] -effects such as 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_101316].  Acetaminophen  (Tylenol®)  is generally  safe but 
high doses can cause hepatic toxicity. One of the limitations of many pain control 
regimens,  including  most  local anesthetic  infiltrations,  is that the effect  usually  lasts for 
less than [ADDRESS_111844] satisfactory 
outcomes. The Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) method is one that is very 
comm only used in postoperative pain management protocols. This method was 
developed  and introduced  by [CONTACT_47310]  H. Sechzer  in the late 1960s  and described  in 1971. 
It consists of allowing people to administer their own pain relief whenever they feel it 
is needed.  On the surgical patient and while in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the usual administration route 
is IV (intravenous), and the drugs usually used on a PCA system are from the opi[INVESTIGATOR_101317].  The infusion  is programmed  by [CONTACT_101345],  lockout 
interva l, maximum drug delivery per hour, and rescue dose. For example, a morphine 
PCA could  be set to deliver  1 mg of morphine  sulfate  on demand  after a lockout  interval 
of 10 minutes,  a maximum  cumulative  dose  of 8 mg per hour,  and a rescue  dose  of an 
extra 2 mg to be given if there is inadequate pain control. If it is set and functioning as 
intended, the machine is unlikely to deliver an overdose of  medication.  
Cryoanalgesia  has  been  used  to  treat  pan  syndromes  including  facial  
neuralgias  and peripheral  neuropathies.12 In the 1980s,  this technique  was applied  for 
postoperative  pain control  in patients  with thoracotomy  with satisfactory  improved  pain 
control  without  adverse  events.13,14  The Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  approved  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/[ADDRESS_111845] commercially available cryoablation probe (CryoICE®, AtriCure, Mason, OH), 
which made the cryotherapy more applicable. Postoperative pain management of 
thoracoabdominal  incisions is the most  invasive  incision  and pose  a difficult  challenge 
to manage  pain control.  Thus,  we propose  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101318].  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_101319].  We will perform  a larger  prospective  randomized 
study if this pi[INVESTIGATOR_101320].  
 
VII. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of the study is to prove the feasibility of intercostal nerve 
cryoablation in postoperative pain control both in magnitude and duration in patients 
undergoing  thoracoabdominal  incisions  for the descending  or thoracoabdominal  aortic 
aneurysm  repair.  
Specific assessment tools that will be used in our study are:  
1. Numeric Pain Scale (NPS) : The NPS measures the intensity of pain. It consists of 
an [ADDRESS_111846]  a value  that correlates  to the pain experienced 
by [CONTACT_476]. A written form can also be used. The NPS has good sensitivity and has a 
good capacity of producing data that can be statistically  analyzed.15,16,17, 18 
2. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) : The Brief Pain Inventory is a medical questionnaire used 
to measure pain, developed by [CONTACT_101346]. Although the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_101321]. Besides assessing pain intensity, it 
assesses how much the pain is affecting their lives. The BPI [CONTACT_832] a powerful tool and, 
having demonstrated both reliability and validity across cultures and languages, is 
being  adopted  in many  countries  for clinical  pain assessment,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_101322], 
and in studies of the effectiveness of pain  treatment.19,20 
3. Five-point satisfaction scale:  This scale is used to assess the patient’s pain 
management experience during their postoper ative care. It consists of patients  rating  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/2019   
 their overall  postoperative  pain management  experience  using  a 5-point  rating  system. 
The scale  is from 1 to 5 with 1 being  “extremely  dissatisfied”,  2 “somewhat  dissatisfied”, 
3 “Neutral/Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied”, 4 “somewhat satisfied” and 5 “extremely 
satisfied”  with their postoperative  pain care.  This rating  has been  used  in other  clinical 
trials of different analgesia to be a reproducible assessment  tool.21 
Primary outcome measures  
• The area under the curve (AUC) of Numeric Pain Scale (NPS) scores through 
72 hours after intraoperative injection – Each subject, using the numeric scale  
from 0 to 10 ([ADDRESS_111847] pain) will self - 
assess pain level at (+/ -2 hours) 7am and 7pm of the third to fifth post - 
operative days. The AUC on a graphical plotting will be used to analyze  data.  
• Brief Pain Inventory (BP I) – Each subject will be asked to complete the BPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_101323], at 7am (+/ -2 hours) of the third to fifth post -operative 
days as well as on their 30th and 180th post-operative  days.  
• 5-point satisfaction scale – Each subject, using a 5 number (1 t o 5) scale will 
be assessed on post -surgical analgesia satisfaction (from 1 being “very 
dissatisfied” to 5 being “very satisfied”). Patients will be assessed using this 
method around 7am of the third to fifth post -operative days and as well as on 
their 30th and 180th post-operative  days.  
 
VIII. SECONDARY  OBJECTIVES  
• To compare opi[INVESTIGATOR_101311].  
• To evaluate and compare patient participation in physical  therapy.  
• To evaluate and compare patient length of stay in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
• To evaluate cost -effectiveness of adding intercostal nerve cryoablation to 
a postoperative pain control  regimen.  
Secondary outcome measures  
• The total amount in mg of opi[INVESTIGATOR_101324] -operative days after  surgery.  
• Requirement of opi[INVESTIGATOR_101325]: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/2019   
 • Requirement of PCA use and amount of PCA  used  
• Patient participation during physical therapy rehabilitation duration to 
reach an optimal functional  level  
• Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101326].  
 
IX. STUDY  POPULATION  
The target population of our study will be comprised of patients that are 18 years -old 
and above  that present  to our group  at the McGovern  Medical  School  at UTHealth  and 
will require thoracoabdominal incision for the descending/thoracoabdominal aortic 
aneurysm repair. Our plan is to enroll 20 patients over a period of 6  months.  
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Patients will be eligible for the study if:  
• 18 years -old or ol der, and

X. STUDY  DRUGS  
CryoICE® CRYO2 cryoablation probe (AtriCure, Inc) is an FDA -approved device for 
the use of intercostal  nerve  cryoablation.  Subjects  will be randomized  into two groups: 
Group  A will receive the study procedure, intercostal nerve cryoablation using 
CryoICE®  CRYO2  cryoablation  probes  (AtriCure,  Inc) to intercostal  spaces  4th to 10th 
in thoracoabdominal aortic repairs and 4th to 8th in descending thoracic aortic repair 
cases. Thi s procedure will be performed under electromyography to confirm the 
successful ablation of the nerve.Group B will not receive cryoablation but will obtain 
electromyography to evaluate as the  control.  
Both patient  groups  will receive  intraoperative  local analgesia  infiltration  with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_101310] (Exparel®, Pacira Pharmacoceuticals) 
and patient -controlled analgesia (PCA)  postoperatively.  
 
XI. STUDY  SCHEDULE  
Expected  start date:  Jan 1st, 2019 
Expected end -date for enrollment:  June 3 0th, 2019 
Length of enrollment for each patient: 6 months 
Length of follow -up for each patient: 6 months 
Expected end -date of study:  January 31st, 2020  
 
XII. STUDY  DESIGN/METHODOLOGY  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/[ADDRESS_111849] care, local anesthesia infiltration of 
Exparel®.  
Screened patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized into one 
of the two study  groups.  Both patient  groups  will receive  intraoperative  local analgesia 
infiltration  with Exparel®  prior to wound  closure  and patient -controlled  analgesia  (PCA) 
postoperatively. Each patient will choose whether or not they will use PCA. The first 
group (A) of patients will receive intraoperative intercostal nerve cry oablation using 
CryoICE®  CRYO2  cryoablation  probes  (AtriCure,  Inc) to intercostal  spaces  4th to 10th 
in thoracoabdominal aortic repairs and 4th to 8th in descending thoracic aortic repair 
cases prior to wound closure. This procedure will be performed under  
electromyography  to confirm  the successful  ablation  of the nerve.  The second  group  
(B) of patients will be injected with Exparel® in the surgical wound. We will obtain 
intraoperative electromyography to evaluate as the control.  
On the screening visit, pat ients should present prior to surgery to receive 
training on the NPS and BPI [INVESTIGATOR_101327], using BPI. This may be performed prior to surgery in the preoperative holding 
area, on the inpatient ward, or in the outpatient settings of the McGovern Medical 
School at UTHealth.  
Patients from both groups will receive the same volume of diluted Exparel®, 
which will be given in four 20ml syringes using 22 -gauge needles (266mg of 
liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], equivalent of one 1.3% 20ml vial of EXPAREL, diluted in 
50ml of preservative -free normal (0.9%) sterile saline for a total volume of  70ml).  
Intercostal muscle electromyogram will be performed in both groups. Group A will 
have it done before and after the cryoablation. This assessment is to confirm the 
completeness of the intercostal nerve cryoablation, as the waveform of the 
electromyogram is expected to disappear after an adequate cryoablation. Group B 
will have the electromyogram prior to wound closure. The surgical wound length will  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/2019   
 be measured. Patients will be injected according to the surgical incision required. 
Patients that require thoracotomies or thoracoabdominal incisions will undergo serial 
intercostal nerve blocks. Intercostal nerve block will be done injecting 10 cc (of the  
total 70cc) on each side of the incision, from two above to two below the incision 
(total 50 cc for intercostal nerve block). In addition, all patients (including all surgical 
incisions) will be injected in the fascia, subcutaneous tissues, periosteum (if  
applicable) and parietal pleura (if applicable). The total volume injected will be 70cc 
regardless of incision type.  
All patients will be blinded to having the cryoablation or not. The surgical 
team will be blinded up only until the time of wound closure as the knowledge of 
cryoablation is inevitable.  
Patients will have access to the standard PCA (Patient -Controlled 
Analgesia) offered at the Memorial Hermann Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – [LOCATION_007] Medical Center. The 
PCA drug will be Dilaudid (hydromorphone). Initial dosing will  be per the standard 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101328] 0.[ADDRESS_111850] after the patient is extubated and can 
adequately evaluate his/her own pain through the Numeric Pain Scale. NPS will be 
repeated and recorded at: twice daily (AM and PM) during the third and fifth post - 
operative day. NPS will also be done right befo re the first opi[INVESTIGATOR_101329] (if applicable and if NPS had not been assessed within the last hour).  
Patients in the study should also complete the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 
before the procedure, at (+/ - 2 hours) of the during the third and fifth post -operative 
day, as well as on their 30th and 180th post-operative days. Patients will be assessed 
on their satisfaction with the postsurgical analgesia. This will be done using the 5 - 
point satisfaction scale with 1 being “very dissatis fied” to 5 being “very satisfied” at  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/2019   
 7am (+/ - 2 hours) of the third to fifth post -op day and as well as on their 30th and 
180th post-operative days. After the 180 -day follow -up and BPI [CONTACT_34055], the patient 
terminates his/her enrollment. This enrollment termination does not mean 
severance of the physician -patient relationship. Patients will be consented and  their 
medical records p ertinent to the study will be collected on a case report form and this 
information will be kept on a secured HIPAA -compliant web -accessed database. No 
protected health information (PHI) will be maintained on the web -accessible 
database.  
 
Study Conduct  
1. Scre ening  
The research group will assess patients as possible candidates for enrollment based 
on the inclusion criteria and the planned surgical exposure: median sternotomy, 
thoracotomy, midline laparotomy, and/or thoracoabdominal incision. Once the 
eligibilit y is met, an informed written consent will be collected. A member of the 
research team - the PI, Co -PI, research coordinator, or nurse will obtain the consent 
from the surgical candidates who met the preliminary inclusion criteria. The consent 
process will  take place either during the preoperative clinic visit, upon inpatient 
admission, or in the preoperative holding area. Patients will be consented before their 
surgical procedures and will be given the appropriate time to think and discuss with 
family abou t being part of the study. There will also be given enough time for the 
patients to ask questions about the protocol and research study. A copy of the signed 
informed  consent  shall be provided  to the patient,  a copy  will be placed  in the patient’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853], and a copy will be kept by [CONTACT_5051]. Medical/surgical history, 
vital signs measurements, drug/alcohol screening, and standard preoperative testing 
will also be performed as per the usual surgical  practice.  
2. Quality of life  assessment - Brief Pain  Inventory  
The impact of pain on patient’s quality of life will be assessed through a brief pain 
inventory (BPI) that should be done before surgery, at 7am (+ - 2 hours) of the third to 
fifth post -operative day as well as on their 30th and 180th post-operative days. The  BPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_101330]: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/[ADDRESS_111851] ed by [CONTACT_101347] [INVESTIGATOR_101331].  
4. Enrollment  
After  the screening  is done,  the eligibility  criteria  are met, and the patient  is consented; 
the patient  will be enrolled  in the trial. At this point,  the study  coordinator/research  office 
will be notified  so that the patient  can be randomly  allocated  to one of the study  groups.  
5. Randomization and Allocation  Concealment  
Randomization and allocation concealment will be performed via a web - 
based/computer generated b lock randomization sequence/list secured in a  password - 
protected secure computer in the trial office accessible only to the research staff 
independent  of the trial administration  process,  who are not involved  in the recruitment, 
data collection, analysis, assessment and/or follow -up. This office/research staff will 
be contact[CONTACT_101348]/investigator to provide certain  specific  
6. Preoperative  assessment  
Pain assessment will be also done using the  BPI [CONTACT_982].  
7. Follow -up 
After the surgical procedure is done, the follow -up will be:  
i. 7am (+ or - 2 hours)  of the third post-op day: the NPS and the the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 5 
-point scale analgesia satisfaction survey will be assessed  
ii. 7pm (+ or - 2 hours) of the third post -op day: the NPS will be  assessed  
iii. 7am (+ or - 2 hours) of the fourth post -op day: the NPS and the the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]  5 
-point scale analgesia satisfaction survey will be assessed  
iv. 7pm (+ or - 2 hours) of the third post -op day:  the NPS will be  assessed  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/2019   
 v. 7am (+ or - 2 hours)  of the fifth post-op day: the NPS and the the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 5 
-point scale analgesia satisfaction survey will be assessed  
vi. 7pm (+ or - 2 hours) of the fifth post -op day: the NPS will be  assessed  
vii. [ADDRESS_111852] his/her enrollment terminated:  
i. After the [ADDRESS_111853] patient,  or 
iii. If any medical/surgical/environmental condition develops that would affect or 
impair primary or secondary outcomes measurements results,  or 
iv. If the study is terminated,  or 
v. If the patient  dies. 
9. Termination of  Study  
i. End of study  period  
ii. If a clinically/statistically significant difference is achieved early during an interim 
analysis.  
 
XIII. ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
Patients enrolled in the trial will be informed to report any unwanted effect at any time 
during the study. Adverse effects of intercostal nerve cryoablation will be made plain 
to the patients during the screening/enrollment as well as in the informed cons ent 
process. Most adverse side effects are injury of the lung or other surrounding 
organs/tissues, which may happen if cryoablation probe is misplaced to the 
organ/tissue. This is extremely rare amongst trained and board -certified vascular 
surgeons. All th e surgeons involved in our study have been extensively trained on  the 
cryoablation technique required for appropriate use. Other adverse effects  include  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/2019   
 allodynia like -pain after  the degeneration of the affected nerve is reported after 
cryoablation  of the nerve,  but this is often  associated  with thoracotomy  procedure  and 
not specific to the cryoablation. Safety monitoring will include assessment  of: 
i. Adverse Effects  (AE) 
ii. Vital Signs  
iii. Wound healing  status  
iv. Scarring  
v. Cardiac  monitoring  
All items above will be closely monitored in a continuous manner, as part of our 
standard postoperative care. Any abnormalities found will be promptly assessed and 
described in the patient’s medical records. Once the patient is discharged it is very 
unlike ly that any of the study  drugs  or procedure  will cause  any abnormalities.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_101332], patients will be asked to contact [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_101333]. Definitions and examples of the standard or known adverse events 
associated with  cryoablation is tingling, burning sensation, etc., will be presented to 
the patient for reference. Patients will be also assessed on the above items on their 
postoperative clinic visits. In addition, emergency contact [CONTACT_101349]. If need be, an immediate unscheduled visit shall be arranged if the patient 
so desires. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101334], changes to the study design or drug 
use will be  determined on an ongoing  basis.  
 
XIV. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN  
A. Primary  Outcomes  
NPS measures will be plotted for each subject over the initial third to fifth 
postoperatively  and the area under  the curve  (AUC)  integrated  to produce  a cumulative 
numeric  pain score.  The primary  endpoint  will be measured  by a statistical  comparison 
of AUC between the groups, using a Wilcoxon rank -sum test. Randomization is 
expected to balance the groups with respect to preoperative risk  factors.  
B. Secondary  Outcomes

C. Sample Size  Determination  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101335]/thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair with 
thoracoabdominal incision.  
Although  the study  is designed  as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101336],  the proposed  sample  size of [ADDRESS_111855] 
a seven  point  decrease  (from  21 to 14) in the cumulative  three -day postoperative  BPI, 
with 80% power  at alpha  <0.05.  This would  equate  to an average  reduction  of roughly 
two points  per day in the 10-point  pain scale  over three  postoperative  days,  or about  a 
1/3 reduction in total pain during that period with cryoablation compared to the control 
treatment. These estimates are based on prior work  by [CONTACT_101350] a randomized 
trial of injectable liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (the control treatment in this trial).  This would 
be a large effect, but certainly within the realm of  feasibility.  
 
 
 
XV. ETHICS  
A. Informed Consent  Process  
All eligible  patients  who meet  the inclusion  criteria  will be consented,  if willing,  after an 
in-depth description of the study, the study drug and its adverse effects, the risks and 
benefits,  follow -up routine,  enrollment  and termination  terms.  The importance  of follow -

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/2019   
 up will be emphasized;  however,  the patient  will retain  the right to voluntarily  withdraw 
from the study at any point. It will also be stressed that patient confidentiality will be 
kept at all times  during  study  through  de-identification  of data.  Information  will be stated 
clearly in a written consent form that will be designed at a 6t h grade level of 
understanding. Information will also be presented verbally. A member of the research 
team,  either  the principal  investigator,  or co-investigators  will obtain  the consent  of the 
patient or other the legally authorized representative of the patient. The consent 
process will take place either during the preoperative clinic visit, upon inpatient 
admission, or in the preoperative holding area. The member of the team who is 
obtaining the written consent will describe the research project in its e ntirety and 
answer the questions of the patient and/or family members should they ask any. 
Sufficient time will be provided to the patient party to review the study before making 
an informed  decision  to participate  or decline.  We will make  sure the patient  have  time 
to deliberate on the risk/benefits of joining the study. If they require, patients will be 
given at least one hour for deliberation and discussion with the research staff, friends 
and/or family members about enrolling or not the study Should the y decide to 
participate,  three  copi[INVESTIGATOR_101337]’s medical record, the study record, and one copy 
will be provided to the  patient.  
 
B. Data Handling and  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_101338]. All sensitive information or patient identifiers will be stored in form of a 
patient linkage file that will link the patient study/trial number to their  clinical records 
and secured  on the Zone  [ADDRESS_111856] protected electronic database that, along with the case report 
forms,  will be de-identified  and contain  only study  relevant  data point s and the patient’s 
trial number. Access to any data pertaining to the study will be restricted to approved 
research  team  members,  the FDA,  institutional  review  boards  of the McGovern  Medical 
School at UTHealth and Memorial Hermann  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

C. Risk/Benefits  
Risks to participants  
There is a small increased risk to the patients by [CONTACT_101351] a possible  chance  of breach  in patient  confidentiality  as the study  involves  evaluation 
of an FDA -approved device. As detailed in the informed consent, the subjects are at 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_101339], abdominal muscle bulging or 
sympathetic  nerve  pararesis.  Patients  will be offered  standard  optimal  medical  therapy 
options, even if that will culminate in withdrawal from the study. In addition, there is 
risk of an unintentional disclosure of personal health  information.  
Benefits to participants  
The patients stand to receive no direct b enefit from the study. However, in the event 
our results endorse the published reports of reduction in postoperative pain by 
[CONTACT_101352], the group of patients receiving it might be indirectly benefitted through 
participation.  
 
 
 
XVI. STUDY  TIMELINE  
Considerin g our group’s  monthly  average  for the given  procedures  and the enrollment 
rates, drop -outs and withdrawal, and interim analyses we estimate recruitment of our 
sample size will take 6 months. Once the follow -up of all enrolled participants is 
finished,  data will be analyzed  and published.  The following  is a chronological  estimate 
of the  stages:  
Stage 1: Patient screening and enrollment 0 - 6 months  
Stage 2: Follow -up up to [ADDRESS_111857] patient enrolled (0 – 12 months) 
Stage 3: Data collection and a nalysis 1 month  
Stage 4: Presentation and publication period (at the end of data analysis)  
 
 
XVII.  QUALITY CONTROL AND  ASSURANCE  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0283 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/05/[ADDRESS_111858]  
There is no relationship between the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_101340]. The 10 probes are provided from the AtriCure Inc. for the 
current study.  
 
XIX. FUTURE PUBLICATION AND  PRESENTATION  
The results of this study will be analyzed and published after the approval of the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_101341] a peer -reviewed scientific journal and/or 
presented at an international/national scientific conference or meeting regardless of 
outcome. The publication will acknowledge members of the study research group for 
their cont ributions and will maintain patient data protection.

Application of Ideal Binary Masking to Disordered Speech

Conditions [ADDRESS_123028] of the phrases representing dysarthric (condition 3) and control speech (condition 4) mixed with noise at a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For a masker, a cafeteria noise (Auditec of St. Louis) will be used to represent a relatively natural listening background. Conditions [ADDRESS_123029] of the same phrases representing dysarthric (condition 5) and control speech (condition 6) mixed with cafeteria noise as in conditions 3 and 4, but processed by [CONTACT_110485]. Speech stimuli will be processed by [CONTACT_110486]-quality D/A converters and a PC. All participants will be seated in a sound treated booth and fitted with Sennheiser HD280 Pro circumaural headphones. Hearing-impaired participants will not wear their hearing aids during testing, but audibility will be ensured through the spectral shapi[INVESTIGATOR_110483] a digital equalizer. Participants will be told that they will be presented with phrases that will be difficult to understand, either because the phrases will be produced by a person with a speech disorder and/or background noise, and that their job is to listen carefully and try to understand what is being said. The experimenter will present the phrases, one at a time, and following each phrase, the participants will be asked to repeat back what they think they heard. The experimenter will type out the participant’s verbal responses. This method was selected over more traditional “hear and type” methods to mitigate possible issues with mobility and typi[INVESTIGATOR_110484], particularly applicable to the older listeners. Responses will be scored for words correct, using previously established scoring criteria for the semantically anomalous phrases and a validated in-house computer program.  Multiple regression analysis will be used to test for differences in PWC scores across the conditions. Each model will control for individual age, gender, and PWC scores in quiet—thereby [CONTACT_110487].

Risks  
This is a minimal risk research study. That  means  that the risks  of participating  are no more  likely  or serious  than  
those  you encounter  in everyday  activities.  The foreseeable risks or discomforts include fatigue due to the length 
of testing ( 30 minutes). In order to minimize those risks and discomforts, you make take short breaks as needed.  
 
Benefits  
There is no direct benefit to you for participating in this research study. More broadly, this study will help the  
researchers  learn  more  about  hearing  and speech  understanding  and may  help  future  individuals  with  
communication  difficulties  through  a deeper  understanding  of how  speech  understanding  can be improved  for this 
population.  
 
Confidentiality  
The researchers  will make  every  effort  to ensure  that the information  you provide  as part  of this study  remains  
confidential. Your participation is anonymous.  Your  identity  will not be revealed  in any publications,  presentations,  
or reports  resultin g from this research study.  
We will collect  your  information  through  assessments  and questionnaires.  Online  activities  always  carry  a risk of 
a data breach, but we will use systems and processes that minimize breach opportunities. Data will be securely  
stored in a restricted -access folder on Box.com, an encrypted, cloud -based storage system and/or in a locked  
drawer in a restricted -access laboratory.  No identifiable data will be collected or stored at any time.  
 
Voluntary Participation & Withdrawal  
Your participation  in this research  is completely  voluntary.  If you do  not complete  the study,  any data  we already  
have  from  you will  be destroyed  as soon  as possible.  
 
Compensation  
For your participation in this research study, you  will receive $ 4. You will al so receive a bonus of $ 1 if you 
demonstrate  engagement  in the task by [CONTACT_110488].  If you choose  to withdraw  before  
completion  of the study,  you will not  receive compensation.  
 
Findings  & Future Participation  
Identifiers may be removed from your data. These de -identified data may be used or distributed for  future 
research without additional consent from you. If you do not wish for us to use your data in thi s way,  please  state

Statistical Design and Power  The outcome measure for the current study is percent words correct (PWC). To test whether there is a difference in PWC between the experimental conditions, linear mixed effects regression analysis will be used. Each mixed effects model will control for covariates including individual age, gender, MOCA score, audiometric thresholds, frequency-specific audibility of stimuli, and QuickSIN scores. We will also assess PWC scores in quiet as both a covariate and as a potential moderator—thereby [CONTACT_110487]—and intra-individual variability. Of particular interest is whether the IBM-processed speech is significantly more intelligible than unprocessed speech in noise (which would indicate that IBM processing provides benefit). These models will also test whether IBM-processed speech is not significantly different from unprocessed speech in quiet (which would provide evidence that IBM processing restores intelligibility of speech in noise to that of speech in quiet). These tests will be done systematically. The first aim includes the unadjusted (bivariate) model as well as the adjusted model discussed in the Research Strategy. Aim [ADDRESS_123032] sizes. This analysis relied on Monte Carlo simulations from a known population model. All code used is provided below. For Aim 1, a minimum of 30 participants will be tested per sub-experiment, as this results in sufficient power for the planned comparisons (for alpha of .05, with [ADDRESS_123033] size of .5, power = .93).    For Aim 2, at least [ADDRESS_123034] indicate this sample size will result in sufficient power for the planned interactions (for alpha of .05, with 6 covariates, power = .91).

V1 8/19/11 Introduction     
Laser in situ keratomileusis  (LASIK) is the most popular form of refractive surgery worldwide.  
However, the LASIK procedure includes the creation of a corneal flap and involves a risk of both 
flap-related complications1 and corneal ectasia2.  Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is an older, 
well established, flapless refractive procedure that has been performed for over [ADDRESS_111643] operative days until the epi[INVESTIGATOR_101057]
13, and that even slight trauma to this 
area (i.e.- rubbing of eye lids against the wound) may cause severe pain.  This would explain 
why standard bandage contact [CONTACT_101073], as they still freely move over the surface of the eye and may abrade the exposed nerve fibers.  Another observation is corneal swelling immediately after both PRK and LASIK. However, swelling is 
significantly reduced the day after surgery in LASIK whereas it increases in patients undergoing 
PRK. One reason for this may be the fact that the replaced LASIK flap following ablation limits 
hydration of the underlying tissue by [CONTACT_101074]. The current study is to evaluate an eye shield made of silicone with extremely high oxygen permeability and zero water content. The objective is to place the shield directly over the 
ablated stromal tissue in order to protect the cornea,  maintain normal corneal hydration 
avoiding edema,  and  promote wound healing. Furthermore, the silicone shield is designed not to move during blinking and eye movement providing for  the potential to significantly reduce 
pain and maintain vision following PRK.

silicone and surface treatments designed to increase the wett ability of the silicone.  The surface 
treatments will include well known plasma-deposited hydrocarbon coatings in sub- micron to 
micron thicknesses used in standard contact [CONTACT_101075].  
All shields will be 300µm or less in center thickness tapering to the outer edge with an outer 
diameter ≤ 16mm. The shield will cover the cornea and part of the conjunctiva.

discretion of the investigator.   The following may be justifiable reasons for the investigator to withdraw a patient from the 
study:  
 
• A patient who is uncooperative or misses two or more consecutive follow -up visits  
• A patient noncompliant with the medical study requirements, including the prescribed use 
of medication 
• A patient erroneously included in the study  
• A patient who develops an exclusion criterion or concurrent disease ( Please note that if 
subject reports pregnancy, that will be considered as developi[INVESTIGATOR_101059].)  
 
Moreover, a patient may be withdrawn from the study for the following medical or administrative reasons:  
 
• Adverse Event (AE):  If a patient suffers an AE that, in the judgment of the Investigator, 
presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the patient, the patient will be 
withdrawn from further participation in the study.  
 If a patient decides to withdraw from participation in the study, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_101077](s) for withdrawal and about any adverse events.  Whenever possible, the patient should return to the study site for final clinical assessments.  It is important for the Investigator to provide a written report on the Patient Disposition page of the CRF describing the reason for withdrawal.

Study Treatment  
The study method is comprised of the placement of an eye shield to the eye after PRK similar to standard bandage lens. A standard bandage contact [CONTACT_101079](s) after 
PRK at the investigator’s discretion.  
 
Methods 
1. Patients planning to undergo PRK will be recruited for the study. 
2. Aside from the procedure described below no alteration in patient management in the 
post PRK period will be made.  
3. Both eyes will be treated in the same manner . 
4. Following detailed explanation and signing an informed consent form each patient will 
receive the following:  
a. Bilateral standard PRK procedure.  A trephine up to 8mm will be used to mark 
the debridement zone.  If the surgeon decides to apply alcohol for debridement, a 
20% alcohol solution placed in the trephine will be used to prepare the cornea for 
debridement. 
b. Standardize d mitomycin use to ablation depth > 70 microns  
  (For LASIK re -treatments mitomycin used in all cases)  
c. At the end of the procedure while still on the surgery table1 gtt of Oph thalmic

Study Completion 
The trial is completed when the planned enrollment has been completed and the enrolled patients exit the study.  
Adverse Events and Reportable Adverse Events 
An adverse event is any undesirable clinical event experienced by a patient during participation in a clinical trial whether or not that event is considered related to the investigational material .  This 
includes a change in the patient’s condition or laboratory results which has or could have a deleterious effect on the patient’s health or well -being.  For example, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101064].  
 Any adverse event reported by a patient or noted by [CONTACT_101081].  The Investigator must categorize each adverse event by [CONTACT_101082] (serious or not serious), relationship to study material  (definite, 
probable, possible, or no relationship), and whether or not the adverse event was unanticipated (listed below are expected/anticipated events for this material).    A finding represents any objective observations made by [CONTACT_101083].  
An objective finding by [CONTACT_101084]: 
• It was not present at the previous visit and not considered part of the surgical procedure (i.e.-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_17754]) 
• It was present at the previous visit(s) but with a lesser severity than the current observation  
 
A symptom  is a noticeable change that is perceived by [CONTACT_102].  Any ocular or systemic 
symptom, which is out of the ordinary  for the patient, will be reported as an adverse event.  The 
patient will be directly questioned about symptoms that occur between visits.   
 
Adverse events will be carefully monitored during the study period.  Minimum requirements of data to be recorded are: type of event, duration of event (start to end), severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome, relationship to material  (definitely, probably, possibly, or not related) , and, if

Page 17 of 23  
V1 8/19/11 possible, the cause of the event. The investigator shall follow the participant until the condition 
clears, returns to baseline, or no longer warrants further follow -up. 
 
• Intra-Operative Adverse Events:  
o Material  malfunction identified prior to  placement 
 
• Post-Operative Adverse Events:  
o Visual acuity loss determined to be unacceptable as judged by [CONTACT_35425]  
o Pain determined to be unacceptable as judged by [CONTACT_35425]  
o Shield lens malposition  
o Shield malfunction (and/or bandage contact [CONTACT_13293])  
o Persistent inflammation after 1 month postop  
o Infection  
o Corneal complications (corneal edema after 1 month, opacification)  
o Corneal sterile infiltrates 
 
Note: Investigator or responsible staff personnel are required to notify the adverse 
events to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  The 
Serious Adverse Event/Unanticipated Adverse material Effect form should be completed 
in as much detail as possible and faxed to Sponsor at:  
FAX (for reporting): ([PHONE_2338]  
Phone (for queries): ([PHONE_2339] 
 
Serious Adverse Events 
Any of the following will be considered a Serious Adverse Event (SAE): 
• Death 
• Life-threatening event  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Complete loss of vision  
• Sight-threatening complication:  
o Endophthalmitis  
 
Trained and competent personnel in recognizing and treating adverse reactions of all types must 
be immediately available; personnel must also have current treatment knowledge.  An event does not need to be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE) if it represents only a relapse or an expected change or progression of pain of discomfort typi[INVESTIGATOR_101065].  
This type of event needs only to be reported as an adverse event.

It is the Investigator’s responsibility to inform the appropriate Institutional  Review Board (IRB) and 
Sponsor about serious adverse events associated with the Corneal Shield. 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Material Effects 
An unanticipated adverse material  effect (UADE) or event is any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a material  if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigation plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a material  that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of patients.  The following events are expected after the procedure:

Changes to the Study Protocol or Conduct of the Study 
All changes must be documented by [CONTACT_101085].  If substantial changes to the design of the study are made, the amendment must be submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_101086] I nvestigator .    
 
Patient Informed C onsent 
Written informed consent is required prior to enrollment in the study.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such consent.  
 
Case Report Forms 
Case Report Forms (CRFs) are provided separately from this clinical protocol document. C RFs will 
be filled out legibly and completely (black or blue ball point pen).  The original and copy of CRFs will be kept by [CONTACT_093].   
 Each patient enrolled in the study will be assigned a unique patient number.  The patient identifier will include the enrollment number. As the person ultimately responsible for the accuracy of all CRF 
data, the Investigator must sign each patient’s CRF.    All study -required data will be completely documented in patient study files . 
 
Study Material Information and Accountability 
 
Coding/Masking:  As this is a non- comparative study, no coding or masking will be used.  
 
Dispensing:  The Investigator, or designee, will be responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_101067] s dispensed.

Documents not submitted that identify the patient (e.g., the signed informed consent document) must be maintained in strict confidence by [CONTACT_093] . 
 
Monitoring  
The Sponsor or Sponsor representative may  visit the investigator periodically for the purpose of 
monitoring the progress of this study in accordance with GCP regulations.  It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to be present or available for consultation during such scheduled monitoring visits.  
During these routine visits, all data pertaining to a patient's participation in this clinical investigation must be made available to the monitor.  Monitoring will include personal visits and other forms of communication to assure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol and in order to comply with guidelines of good clinical practice.  On-site review of CRFs will include a review of 
forms for completeness and clarity, and for consistency with source documents.  Note that a variety 
of original documents, data, and records will be considered as source documents in this trial.   A copy of the patient’s stu dy laboratory values will be added to the CRF, and the original document 
will remain in the source document file.  
The Sponsor or Sponsor representative may request to witness patient evaluations occurring as 
part of this protocol.  The Investigator and appropriate personnel may be periodically requested to attend meetings/workshops organized by [CONTACT_101088].

Examination Procedures, Tests, Equipment and Techniques 
 
 
Visual Acuity (uncorrected) 
 
Introduction: Distance uncorrected visual acuity will be measured at baseline and follow -up visits 
as shown in Table 1. Standard ETDRS acuity chart will be used for measuring VA. 
 In order to provide standardized and well-controlled assessment of visual acuity during the study, 
all visual acuity assessments for a subject must be performed consistently (e.g., the same lighting conditions, viewing distance, etc.) during the entire study.  
 
Scoring Best -Corrected Visual Acuity 
 
While looking through the manifest refraction in the phoropter giving the best vision according to 
the patient and the patient properly aligned with the ETDRS chart, the patient should be asked to 
read the smallest line that he can distinguish on the chart. If the patient chooses a line and reads it 
perfectly, he should be encouraged to read the next smallest line and so on until he makes errors in reading a line. The visual acuity is the largest Snellen fraction corresponding to the line of smallest letters that the patient can read with two or less mistakes. If one line is read with two 
mistakes and the next smallest line is read with three letters misread, the visual acuity should be recorded as the Snellen fraction corresponding to the line that was read with two mistakes, using “ -
2” to indicate the [ADDRESS_111668] clinical practice.  
 Observations will be documented on the appropriate Case Report Form:  
The clinician will examine the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber of the eye with the aid of a slit 
lamp, which is a table-mounted binocular microscope.  Fluorescein dye will be instilled into the ocular cul -de-sac to facilitate this examination as indicated by [CONTACT_101089].  The 
patient will be seated during the examination.  Grading will be done as follows: 
 
 
CORNEA  
Edema  
None  (0)= Transparent and clear or less than mild  
Mild (+1) =  Dull glassy appearance  
Moderate (+2)=  Dull glassy appearance of epi[INVESTIGATOR_101068] (+3) =  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_101069]/or stromal edema, localized or diffuse, with or without stromal 
striae  
 
 
 Staining/Erosion  
None (0)=  No fluorescein staining of epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], OR less than mild  
Mild (+1) =  Slight fluorescein staining confined to a small focus

V1 8/19/11 Moderate (+2)=  Regionally dense fluorescein staining (1 mm or greater in diameter) with underlying 
structure moderately visible  
Severe (+3) =  Marked fluorescein staining or epi[INVESTIGATOR_101070] (Anterior Segment)  
Cells  
None (0)=  No cells seen or less than mild  
Mild (+ 1) =  + cells  
Moderate (+2) =  ++ cells  
Severe (+3) =  +++ cells  
Hypopyon (+4)=  ++++ cells, Hypopyon Formation (indicate size of hypopyon)  
 Flare  
None (0)=  No Tyndall effect or less than mild  
Mild (+1) =  Tyndall beam in the anterior chamber has a mild intensity  
Moderate (+2) =  Tyndall beam in  the anterior chamber is of strong intensity  
Severe (+3) =  Tyndall beam is very intense.  The aqueous has a white, milky appearance  
 
Photography 
 
As part of the biomicroscopic examination, photographs may be taken by [CONTACT_101090]/bandage contact [CONTACT_13293], ocular conditions, or other observations 
made by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator.  These are to be taken consistent with standard clinical practice.  The 
patient’s name [CONTACT_101094].

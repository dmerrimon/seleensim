of patients.  We also  aim to explore associations  between  tear LTB4  concentration,  eye 
comfort, visual performance, and  subjective  visual quality  after  6-8 hours (full day  of 
wear)  toric  and spherical  contact [CONTACT_93827].
1.2 Primary  Hypotheses: Subjects  will have better  near  visual acuity  and near  
visual performance with  toric,  as opposed to  spherical,  contact [CONTACT_375711].  As 
such, the following hypotheses will be tested:
H01: There is  no statistically  significant difference in  near  visual acuity  or near  
vision performance between  contact [CONTACT_375712]1: There is  a statistically  significant difference in  visual acuity  or vision 
performance between  contact [CONTACT_375713]
2.[ADDRESS_469962] than  traditional visual acuity  
measures  in being  a detection  rather  than  recognition  task,  is always  of equal difficulty,  
there is  limited  time for observer adjustments  such as  blinking/squinting, and  a staircase 
procedure ensures a definitive  endpoint. Wolffsohn’s lab  has recently  developed  an iPad-
based  application  to assess dynamic  visual acuity  (see Appendix A).
Woods et al3 began  exploring patients’  preferences  conducting real-world tasks  such as  
the ability  to locate a web  page,  read  a newspaper or use a computer.  They  showed that 
while the difference in  standard acuity  testing  was small,  patients  reported significant  
subjective improvements  in driving, watching  a television,  and using a desktop computer,  
among  others.3 Wolffsohn and  colleagues  recently  developed  iPad  based  applications  that 
can quantify reading  performance on digital  devices  while the user performs reading  
tasks  (see also  Appendix B ).4 The user’s face  is analyzed  in real-time by [CONTACT_375714].  Swipes, changes  in 
magnification  and the time to  complete the task  are also  assessed. This  group also  
developed  a Near  Activity  Visual Questionnaire (NAVQ) (Appendix C) to  quantify 
subjective near  visual function.5

lens discomfort was  related  to upregulation of tear  eicosanoid  biomarkers. Masoudi et al  
found a higher tear  concentration  of Leukotriene B4  (LTB4)  at the end  of the day  in 
symptomatic soft contact [CONTACT_375718].[ADDRESS_469968] lens  wear.  We also  aim to explore the association  
between  tear LTB4  concentration,  eye comfort, visual performance, and  subjective visual 
quality  after  6-8 hours (full day) of toric  and spherical contact [CONTACT_93827].

Patient demographics The subjects  will be asked  questions about their  age,  sex, race 
and ethnicity.
History The subjects  will be asked  questions about their  systemic and  eye 
health  and surgical history and  medications.  The subjects  will be 
asked  questions about how they  use their  current contact [CONTACT_13276],  
such as  their  current contact [CONTACT_375728],  as

examine the health  of the front of the eye,  including  conjunctival 
and limbal redness using Cornea and  Contact [CONTACT_375731] 
(CCLRU)  grading scale.  Sodium fluorescein  (NaFl) and  
lissamine green  are  temporary  dyes that  are used in  routine 
contact [CONTACT_375732].
Tear collection Tears  will be collected  from both eyes  using glass  microcapi[INVESTIGATOR_375705]  (BLAU_BRAND, Intramark, Werthein,  [LOCATION_013]) and  
pooled together  in a low  adhesion Eppendorf tube.  The collected

In addition  to ulcerative keratitis,  the following problems may  occur  when wearing  
contact [CONTACT_13276]:
Other, less  serious, infections  or inflammation  of the  eye(s)
Burning, stinging, itching,  dryness or general irritation  of the eye(s)
Corneal neovascularization  (small  blood vessels  growing into  the cornea)  
Excessive  watering,  unusual eye  secretions,  or redness of the eye

Key Information:  
You are being  asked  to participate in  a research  study to  help  us evaluate the vision and  performance of 
different types  of contact  [CONTACT_375755].  In addition,  we will be evaluating  the 
composition  of the  tears  on the front of your eye  after  wearing  the different types  of lenses.  You may  
be eligible to  be in  the study because  you have a certain  amount of astigmatism  (due to  the curvature of 
the front of your eye).  
We will be testing  different types  of soft contact [CONTACT_375756].  As such, you may  get slightly  different vision with  each  set of contact [CONTACT_13276].  At the end  of the 
study, the study doctors will explain  the differences  in the contact [CONTACT_375757]. 
Taking  part in  this study is  entirely  voluntary, meaning  that you may  or may  not choose to  participate.

Version: Jan19What  happens  if I say yes, I want  to be  in this research?
All of the  tests  done during the study are  described  above. All  of the contact [CONTACT_375766]. The eye examination  and contact [CONTACT_375767].  The questionnaires and  special vision and  reading  testing  are done for research  
purposes to  get a better  idea of how subjects  are performing with  the contact [CONTACT_13276].  
An iPad  app will be used to  measure your reading  performance. This  iPad  App uses the front camera to  
track  your blinks and  eye movements,  as well as  to make sure that you are properly lined  up with  the 
device.  The video/images  will be deleted  after  they  are checked  for accuracy  at the  end of each  study 
visit.
This research  study will be conducted  at Richdale  Lab by [CONTACT_375768]. Optometrists  (eye 
doctors) will  fit the  contact [CONTACT_375769]. A research  assistant may  
help with  the questionnaire and  visual performance testing.
The contact  [CONTACT_375770],  like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  You will have 
equal chance of starting  with  either  lens design treatment.  Neither  you nor the study doctor evaluating  
your performance will know which  lens design you are using. 
Audio, video  or photograph will be not be taken  during the  study.
What  are my responsibilities  if I take part in this research?
If you agree  to be a part of this research,  you will be responsible for wearing  the assigned contact 
[CONTACT_94644] [ADDRESS_470013] six  hours before coming  to the 
outcome visits  (Visits  3 and  5). 
What  happens  if I do not want  to be in this research?
You can  choose not to  take part in  the research,  and it will not be held  against you. Choosing not to  
take part will  involve no penalty  or loss of benefit  to which  you are otherwise entitled.
If you are a student, a decision  to take  part or not, or to  withdraw from the research  will have no effect 
on your grades and/or standing with  the University of Houston.  If you are receiving  clinical care,  a 
decision  to take  part or not, or withdraw from the research,  will have no effect on what would be 
offered to  you as  part of routine care.  If you are an  employee of the  University of Houston, a decision  
to take part or not, or to  withdraw from the research  will have no effect  on your employment  with  the 
University of Houston
If you chose not to  be in  this study, you can  ask your eye doctor if  you can  be fitted  for contact [CONTACT_13276].  
What  happens  if I say yes, but  I change  my mind  later?
You can  leave  the research  at any  time it will not be held  against  you.
If you decide to  leave the research,  you will not be compensated  for study visits  after  you exit  the study 
and the data collected  up to  the point of study exit may  still be used. If you decide  to leave  the study,

Version: Jan19If you stop being  in the research,  already  collected  data may  not be removed  from the study database.  
You will be asked  whether  the investigator  can collect data  from your routine medical care.  If you 
agree,  this data  will be handled  the same as  research  data.  
Is there any  way  being in this study  could be bad for me?
The risks to  subjects  from participation  in the study are minimal.  The procedures in  the study (slit lamp  
exam,  contact [CONTACT_375746],  etc.)  are commonly  used clinical procedures in  optometry  and 
ophthalmology. 
The usual risks which  exist during the performance of tear  collection  may  include minor  eye 
discomfort, irritation,  and temporary  redness of the  eyes.  The discomfort is  usually  self-limiting  and 
can be resolved with  the use of over the counter  artificial tears.  A break  will be given  if you experience 
any discomfort or irritation  during tear  collection.
Commercially  available (FDA approved) contact [CONTACT_375771]. While most 
individuals  wear  contact  [CONTACT_375772], there are  some risks associated  with  wearing  contact 
[CONTACT_13276].  Ulcerative keratitis  (infection  of the clear  front part of the eye),  is the most severe risk and  can 
lead to loss of vision. Ulcerative keratitis  is estimated  to happen to  about 1-[ADDRESS_470014]  lenses.  The risk of ulcerative keratitis  may  be reduced  by [CONTACT_375773]’s directions  for lens  care  including  throwing out your contact [CONTACT_375774], never  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_375706],  and never  exposing your contact [CONTACT_375743].
The following problems may  also occur  when wearing  contact [CONTACT_13276]:
Other, less  serious, infections  or inflammation  of the  eye(s)
Burning, stinging, itching,  dryness or general irritation  of the eye(s)
Corneal neovascularization  (small  blood vessels  growing into  the cornea)  
Excessive  watering,  unusual eye  secretions  (such as mucus), or redness of the eye(s)
Reduced  or blurred vision (compared  to glasses)
Seeing  rainbows or halos  around bright lights  (compared  to glasses)
In the event you experience signs or symptoms associated  with  one of the problems listed  
above, you should immediately  contact [CONTACT_375775] [PHONE_7776] (during regular  business hours) 
or the study Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_353746],  at [PHONE_7319] (outside business 
hours).
Will I receive anything for being  in this study?
If you are eligible for the study and  complete all 5 study visits  you will receive a $[ADDRESS_470015] ($50/visit for 5 visits)  and parking validation  at any  study visit(s) for the patient parking lot.  If 
you attend  the first visit  but are  not eligible  (screen  fail),  you will receive a $[ADDRESS_470016]  for 
Visit 1. If you are  exited  from the study at a later  visit (due to  problems with  the fit or vision of the 
contact [CONTACT_13276],  or not attending  the study visits  as assigned), you will only be paid  for the study visits  
that you completed  on time.  You will be paid  when you complete  or otherwise exit the study.

2.0 Background and Significance  
Many adults experience cognitive decline with aging. The causes of cognitive dysfunction in older 
adult s range from the devastating effects of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to treatable causes of dysfunction 
and include the normal mild forgetfulness described by [CONTACT_676081]. Recently, there has been 
a move to identify cognitive difficulties at the ear liest stage, rather than waiting until difficulties progress to 
the level of dementia. Early detection is crucial, as even mild cognitive dysfunction can impair decision 
making and impact functional abilities. Early detection can provide an opportunity to identify potentially 
treatable causes of cognitive loss, and the opportunity to make future plans at a time when symptoms are 
mild and patients are able to make informed decisions. Identifying mild cognitive loss, regardless of 
etiology, will also help the  family and physician determine whether the individual can safely manage 
complex activities, such as making financial decisions, handling complex medication regimens, or 
continuing to work and drive.  
Identifying cognitive impairment becomes increasingly i mportant as the US population ages and 
increasing numbers of older individuals live with cognitive dysfunction. Current trends in healthcare 
suggest that the majority of elderly individuals obtain their care solely from their family physician and will 
not be referred for specialist evaluation. Beginning in January 2011, in compliance with the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, Sec 4103), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
began covering the costs of an Annual Wellness Visit. As p art of this visit, primary healthcare providers 
are instructed to detect cognitive dysfunction based on direct observation, objective testing, the patient’s 
own reports, and/or information from family members, friends, and caregivers. Although published 
guidelines exist to aid the physician in this assessment, the availability of effective tools to accomplish this 
goal in the context of a busy office with abundant and competing priorities remains scarce.  
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_914022] batt ery includes the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) and 
neuropsychological tests designed to detect deficits across multiple cognitive domains:  
 
(1) WAIS -IV Digit Span Forward and Backward (Wechs ler, 1987)  
(2) WAIS -IV Digit Symbol (Wechsler, 1987)  
(3) Hopkins Verba l Learning Test – Revised (HVLT -R;Brandt and Benedict,2001;Benedict, Schretlen, 
Groninger, & Brandt, 1998)  
(4) Logical Memory; Wechsler Memory Scale I V (WMS -IV) 
(5) Trail Making Test part A and part B (Reitan, 1958)  
(6) [LOCATION_011] Naming Test 2nd edition (Kaplan et al., 2 000) 
(7) REY Figure copy and delayed recall (Meyers and Meyers, 1995)  
(8) Semantic Fluency (animals) (Spreen and Strauss, 1997)  
(9) Letter Fluency (number of letters starting with “F” “A” and “S” in 60 seconds each)  
 
CAMCI  Computerized  Task Battery   
CAMCI  is a compute rized screening tool for the assessment of cognitive status.  CAMCI accurately 
assesses cognitive performance using standard neuropsychological tests of memory, attention, and 
executive ability modified for computer administration, and an innovative Virtual  Environment task , testing 
domains such as incidental memory, not easily assessed using paper -pencil tests. Computer -
administered tasks ensure standard administration and scoring, avoiding inter -site and inter -examiner 
variability.  The CAMCI battery consis ts of tasks testing multiple aspects of cognitive function, and a series 
of self -report questions administered via tablet computer. Using touchscreen technology for response 
input,  CAMCI takes approximately [ADDRESS_914023] 
recognition.  
 
3.2 Protocol 1 (Specific Aim 3)  
The purpose of  this protocol is to validate the CAMCI scoring algorithm on an independent sample of 
older individuals. Approximately [ADDRESS_914024] battery , a survey  requesting feedback from the 
participant concerning their experience with the CAMCI application , and a brief reading assessment . The 
paper -pencil tests will be used by [CONTACT_676082] (see Appendix  A) to adjudicate the 
participants. Th e baseline test session will take approximately 2.5 hours  to complete , and participants will 
be paid $ 100 for completion of th is portion of the  study . 
 
 
Version 3.0  If an equivalent and valid neuropsychological task battery assessment (as determined by [CONTACT_235039] -certified exami ner) is available at the time of enrollment in the study, the 
neuropsychological task battery will not be re -administered, and the protocol will be shortened to 
administer all remaining elements. In this case, total test session time is estimated to be 
approximately 60 minutes, and participants will be paid $ [ADDRESS_914025] session (either 6 month s and 12 months, or 12 months and 24 months). During the follow -up 
test sessions, participants will be asked to complete the  MoCA , the CAMCI battery of tasks, and a 
complete paper -pencil neuropsychological test battery  (the survey and reading assessment wi ll not be 
repeated) . Each follow -up test session will take approximately 2 hours to complete, and participants will 
be paid $ [ADDRESS_914026] session completed.  Total compensation for each participant may be 
up to $ [ADDRESS_914027] session 
before completion, the participant will be paid $25.  
 
3.3 Protocol 2  (Specific Aim 4)  
The purpose of this pro tocol is to verify applicability of the scoring algorithm for older individuals to 
additional populations. Therefore, the focus will be to recruit a sample of African American (n=225) and 
Hispanic (n=175) subjects (of any race). Adult male and female African American and/or Hispanic 
participants [ADDRESS_914028] battery , a survey requesting feedback from the 
participant concerning their experience with the CAMCI application, and a br ief reading assessment . The 
paper -pencil tests will be used by [CONTACT_676082] (see Appendix  A) to adjudicate the 
participants. Th e baseline test  session will take approximately 2.5 hours  to complete , and participants will 
be paid $ 100 for complet ion of th is portion of the  study . 
 
If an equivalent and valid neuropsychological task battery assessment (as determined by [CONTACT_290442]) is available at the time of enrollment in the study, the neuropsychological task battery 
will not be re -administered, a nd the protocol will be shortened to administer all remaining 
elements. In this case, total test session time is estimated to be approximately 60 minutes, and 
participants will be paid $ [ADDRESS_914029] session 
before completion, the participant will be paid $25.  
 
3.4 Protocol 3 (Specific Aim 5) 
The purpose of this protocol is to validate the readability and usefulness of the C AMCI report with a 
sample of potential users of the product. We will recruit and test healthcare professionals (N=60) who 
would be responsible for interpretation of the CAMCI report and decisions concerning patient care (e.g., 
physicians, physician’s assis tants, neuropsychologists).   
 
After consent, participants will be presented with a series of case studies including information expected 
to be available during an assessment of cognitive status (e.g.,  MoCA , list of medications, patient report, 
etc.) as wel l as the results of CAMCI testing, and will be asked to respond to a series of questions related 
to 1) thoroughness of the information provided, 2) usefulness of information, and 3) recommended course 
 
Version 3.0  of action  based on the CAMCI report, and 4) their likel ihood to use the tool . In addition, the readability of 
the CAMCI report will be evaluated by [CONTACT_676083]. Report validation will occur in two phases during Year 1 (N=30) and Year 3 (N=30) in conj unction 
with the efforts to validate the scoring algorithm and develop the change metric.  Each test session will 
take approximately 60 minutes to complete, and participants will be paid $100 for completion of this 
portion of the study.  
 
4.0 Human Subjects  
 
4.1 General Characteristics.   
The age, racial, gender and ethnic characteristics of the proposed participant population are based on the 
need s of each specific  aim involving human subjects.   
 
Protocol 1 (Specific Aim 3)  
The goals of Specific Aim [ADDRESS_914030] the demographic  distribution within  the [LOCATION_002] 
(https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045216 , Population estimates, July 1, 2016).  The 
proposed participant population  of adults ages 60+  is 77% White, 13% Black or African American,  6% 
Asian, 4% all other racial groups, 18 % Hispanic  (of any race) , and 51% female   
 
Protocol 2 (Specific Aim 4)  
The goals of Specific Aim 4 are to verify applicability of the scoring algorithm to additional populations and 
increase minority representation.  We will recruit a total of 400 African American subjects and Hispanic 
subjects  of any races  (225 African American subjects, and 175 Hispanic subjects of any race). All 
subjects will be adults ages 60 -95. The specific focus of this effort includes 100% par ticipation from 
ethnic/racial minorities , with 50% of each gender .  
 
Protocol 3 (Specific Aim 5) 
The goal of Specific Aim 5, to validate the CAMCI reporting feature, will involve the recruitment of 
healthcare professionals  as potential users of the product . The most important qualification for 
recruitment in accomplishing this aim is professional position and expertise concerning cognitive 
assessment. We will seek to recruit professionals at a rate matching that of the population of healthcare 
professionals . Females account for more than [ADDRESS_914031] U.S. health occupations 
(http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/supplydemand/usworkfor ce/diversityushealthoccupations.pdf ). 
Whites make up 77.6%, Blacks or African Americans represent 13.6%, Asians make up 6%, and 
individuals reporting multiple races or other race represent 2%. Hispanics comprise 15.5% of workers in 
most U.S. health occupa tions. Therefore, the proposed participant population for specific aim 5 is 78% 
White, 14% Black or African American, 6% Asian, 2% all other racial groups, 16% Hispanic , and 80% 
female . 
 
4.2. Inclusion of Children in Research.  This study deals with disorde rs of memory in adults associated 
with aging and other causes .  Therefore, the study is not applicable to children.  
 
4.3 General Inclusion criteria . Signed informed consent; adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow 
neuropsychological testing; able to r ead, write and understand study and test requirements ; within the 
age range of 60+ (Protocols 1 and 2), professional position in a healthcare field (Protocol 3) . 
 
4.[ADDRESS_914032] dem entia, 
Parkinson’s disease, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], stroke, multiple sclerosis or head trauma; history of major depression or 
other major psychiatric disorder, such as, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; history of consuming 5 or 
more alcoholic drinks per day on a regu lar basis ; MoCA score <10 .  
 
4.5 Recruitment Procedures .  
 
Version 3.0  Protocols 1 -2: Potential participants will be ident ified by a subject recruiter  through response to 
advertisement or referral, and at a variety of community and clinical sources (e.g., PCP offices, local 
churches, community centers, clinics) . The test is purely cognitive, so no medical records will be 
requested. The subject recruiter will describe the study to the participant and ask if they are interested in 
participating.  If they express an interes t, study staff will meet with the participant to discuss the study in 
detail and to obtain informed consent. Participants who fail to demonstrate an adequate understanding of 
the material reviewed during the informed con sent process , or who score  <10 on th e MoCA  will be 
excluded.  
 
Protocol 3:  Potential participants will be identified through professional connections , referral, and 
advertisement. The PI, co -investigators, consultants, and research staff on the project have links to a 
broad range of academic  and clinical departments at Universities and community health care services  in 
the local area and across the country  at which we will solicit for professionals interested in participating in 
the study . In addition, we  will research community and health or ganizations  in and around the city of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] (spanning a 10 county area) providing varying services to older adults (e.g., rehab facilities, 
outpatient clinics, physician offices, community centers) , and  will provide flyers, presentations, and/or 
addit ional information to these organizations, as requested, to raise interest in the project and to recruit 
participants.  
 
4.6 Risk/Benefit Ratio . Some individuals may experience fatigue, frustration, or feel slightly distressed if 
they think they are not doin g well on a test of intellectual ability. If the participant indicates any distress 
the test will be discontinued , or breaks will be provided, if requested . Other than payment for participation, 
there  are no direct benefits to participants from participati ng in this study. Participants will be informed 
that the results of this study may help identify early signs of memory problems. If a previously unknown 
disorder is identified (i.e., MoCA <10 ), we will refer the participant to the appropriate health and 
community services and if consent is provided, the results of the  MoCA  will be provided to their 
health care provider of choice . Results will not be provided directly to an individual, and as CAMCI  is not 
yet an FDA -cleared tool for clinical assessment, compu ter test scores collected or reported by [CONTACT_676084] .  
 
4.[ADDRESS_914033] forms and/or procedures that have been 
established  for the clinical t rial. The yearly IRB renewal for this study will include a summary report of the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan findings from the prior year.   
 
4.[ADDRESS_914034] 5 years after the study 
ends.  
 
4.9 Alternative Treatments . Not Applicable.  
 
4.10 New Information . Participants  will be promptly notified if any new information, either good or bad, 
develops during the course of this study that may cause a change of mind about continuing to participate.

Introduction  
Controversy surrounds the use of regional cerebral oximetry (rSO 2) as a measure of true 
cerebral oxygenation  because extracranial contamination has  been demonstrated for cerebral 
oximeters from several manufacturers .[ADDRESS_845094] of cerebral a:v ratio2 which is assumed fixed within mathematical algorithms 
used in device software.  Yet , cerebral oximetry has been employed in multiple clinical settings3-
5 and decreases below an absolute measure of 50% or relative decreases  of 20% appear to  
correlate to cerebral ischemia.2  Furthermore, low baseline values are associated with  poor 
outcome .6 
The measurement of brain tissue oxygen (PbrO 2) has been used in routine neurosurgery7 and 
has been shown to reliably demonstrate cerebral hypoxia following severe head injury .[ADDRESS_845095] measure of cerebral oxygenation but probe insertion is highly invasive and 
hence precludes use outside of the neurosurgical or neur ocritical care setting.   Correlation 
between rSO 2 and jugular bulb monitoring has been demonstrated under conditions o f varying 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_619039]  (FIO 2) in both uninjured9 and injured human brain10 but no study  has 
been specifically designed to compare  PbrO 2 (the most reliable) and rSO 2 (the least invasive) as 
mea sures of cerebral oxygenation.   Here, we test the hypothesis that there is a correlation 
between PbrO [ADDRESS_845096] because confirmation of the hypothesis would 
validate cerebral oximetry as a surrogate of cerebral oxygenation.   
 
Methods/Design  
The primary aim of this prospective cohort study is to evaluate for correlation between PbrO 2 
and rSO 2.  The secondary aim  is to investigate  the relationship between combined changes in 
FIO 2 and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) with both PbrO [ADDRESS_845097] at the 
surgeon’s office or at a separate pre -operative clinic within [ADDRESS_845098] rSO 2 values11 and the study is 
small , recruitment will be limited to Caucasian patients. All patients will undergo the same 2 
step variation in ventilation strategy designed to maximize the potential changes in brain 
oxygenation.  
Following pre -oxygenation, an esthesia will be induced using fentanyl (1 -2mcg/kg) and propofol 
(0.5-2mg/kg).  Muscle relaxation will be initiated and maintained with an appropriate 
combination of succinylcholine  and non -depolarizing muscle relaxants as deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_632937] .  
The patient’s trachea will be intubated and their lungs will be ventilated to achieve an FIO 2 and 
PaCO 2 determined by [CONTACT_4690].  General anesthesia will be maint ained by [CONTACT_632938] (TIVA) with a combination of propofol (80 -150 mcg/kg/min) and 
remifentanil (0.05 -0.1 mcg/kg/min)  targeted to a Bispectral Index range 40 -60 (BIS; Covidien, 
Boulder, CO) .   
Routine perioperative monitoring and invasive blood pressure monitoring will be used  for all 
patients .  rSO 2 will be measured using the INVOS 5100B monitor (Somanetics Corporation, Troy, 
MI) and PbO 2 using the LICOX brain tissue oxygen monitoring system (Integra LifeSciences 
Corporation, Plainsboro, NJ).  BIS and rSO 2 optodes will be applied, before induction of 
anesthesia, by a single researcher on both sides of the patient’s forehead, as recommended  by 
[CONTACT_3455] .  Baseline readings will be recorded in the pre -operative holding room with 
the patient sitting and breathing room air.   
Following craniotomy, the LICOX probe will be placed under direct vision into an area of normal 
brain within the t umor excision canal by [CONTACT_632939].  The probe will secured in 
place and allowed to equilibrate as directed by [CONTACT_3455].   The s tarting tidal volume will 
be set at 6 -8 mls/kg  and adjustments will be made by [CONTACT_632940][INVESTIGATOR_697] r ather than 
manipulating tidal volume further.  During a pause in surgery FIO 2 and minute ventilation will 
be sequentially adjusted to achieve  the following pairs of ventilation set points :  
1) FIO 2 0.3 and paCO2 30mmHg  
2) FIO 2 1.0 and paCO2 40mmHg  
Changes in rSO 2 are complete and stable within 5 minutes following a change in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_632933] ;4 LICOX responds more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].  Thus, after ≥5 minutes at each set point FIO 2, 
PaCO2, rSO 2 and PbrO 2 will be recorded as a “snap -shot” . Blood pressure, heart rate, 
hematocrit, BIS value and propofol and remifentanil infusion rates will also be recorded at each 
set point.  The anesthesiologist caring for the patient will be blinded to the measures of 
cerebral oxygenation. N 2O, a possible confounding factor, will be avoided.  Bolus dose 
phenylephrine is associated with a 2.8% reduction in rSO [ADDRESS_845099].  A total of two blood samples  (2 teaspoons each) will be collected 
during the surgery through the arterial line, which is already in place for surgery.  This will allow 
us to measure arterial blood gas and hematocrit levels.  Demographic  and intra -operative data 
will be retrieved from  the patient’s electronic anesthetic and medical records.   The preliminary 
de-identified electronic data captured in this study will be retained for future use in a larger -
scale study.   No specimens will be retained for any reason as part of the research s tudy.  
Statistical analysis  
A sample size of 15 achieves  an 80% power with a one -sided type I error of 5 % to detect a positive 
correlation of 0.6 (from the null hypothesis of no correlation) between changes in PbrO 2 and 
changes in rSO 2 subsequent on alterations made in ventilation  strategy.  Correlation w ill be 
measured using Pearson’s Correlation.  P values < 0.[ADDRESS_845100] typi[INVESTIGATOR_632934], oxygenation and intracranial

within brain parenchyma.  Even with this highly invasive approach the technique is reported to 
be safe ,13 the main complication being hematoma which occurs  in < 2% patients.[ADDRESS_845101] not been

 2 			Protocol:	Intervention:	Leg	Movement	Rate		Significance		Infants	with	developmental	delay	often	experience	lifelong	functional	limitations	in	motor,	cognitive	and	social	domains.	A	strictly-defined,	conservative	estimate	recently	determined	that	~9%	of	infants	in	the	US	are	eligible	for	early	intervention	services	because	they	are	at	risk	for	developmental	delay.	Diagnoses	of	developmental	delay	are	typi[INVESTIGATOR_708967]	[ADDRESS_963880]	in	the	field12,	and	researchers	are	starting	to	investigate	the	feasibility	of	different	approaches	for	providing	early,	intense	interventions13,14.	Although	these	approaches	are	laudable	and	strongly	theoretically	based	there	is	a	fundamental	gap:	we	do	not	know	what	amount	and	type	of	movement	experience	is	necessary	and	sufficient	to	have	a	positive	effect	on	the	development	of	infant	neuromotor	control.	This	proposal	will	address	this	fundamental	question	by	[CONTACT_708981]-based	minimum	threshold	for	quantity	and	type	of	movement	and	measuring	the	association	between	amount	of	leg	movement	experience	and	motor	development	rate.		The	intervention	promotes	movement	experience	from	[ADDRESS_963881]	a	poor	neuromotor	outcome	than	infants	who	demonstrate	a	leg	movement	rate	above	1200	movements	per	hour	of	awake	time.	Further,	infants	at	risk	for	developmental	delay	move	their	legs	significantly	less	and	make	a	higher	proportion	of	unilateral	movements	than	infants	with	typi[INVESTIGATOR_708968].	The	goal	of	the	intervention	is	to	increase	infant	movement	experience	above	the	quantity	threshold	while	consisting	of	the	prescribed	type	(1200	movements	per	hour	of	awake	time	with	variety	of	type	of	movement)	in	order	to	provide	sufficient	and	necessary	experience	for	learning	neuromotor	control.		Approach		Recruitment.	Participants	will	be	a	representative	sample	of	12	infants	AR	recruited	using	4	methods.	1)	The	infants	will	be	recruited	with	fliers	placed	around	USC	campuses	and	public	spaces	such	as	local	libraries.	Fliers	will	also	be	distributed	in	person	and/or	electronically	via	email	to	local	early	intervention	providers,	on	social	media	sites	including	facebook	and	instagram,	and	on	the	website	of	the	Division	of	Biokinesiology	and	Physical	Therapy.	The	parent	or	legal	guardian	will	be	asked	to	contact	[CONTACT_708982],	including	further	discussion	of	the	inclusion	criteria.	When	the	parent	or	legal	guardian	contacts	research	staff,	the	research	staff	will	give	more	specific	information	about	the	study	and	answer	any	questions.	If	they	choose	to	participate	after	the	initial	contact,	a	written	consent	form	will	be	mailed	to	them.	This	will	allow	the	parents	and/or	legal	guardians	to	discuss	their	participation	with	others	before	signing	the	written	consent.	2)	A	licensed	healthcare	provider	at	CHLA	or	an	early	intervention	provider,	with	the	permission	of	the	parent	or	legal	guardian,	will	provide	the	research	staff	with	the	name	[CONTACT_708992]	a	potential	infant	participant	who	is	under	their	professional	care.	Research	staff	will	call	the	parent	or	legal	guardian	and	give	more	specific	information	about	the	study	and	answer	any	
 [ADDRESS_963882],	a	written	consent	form	will	be	mailed	to	them.	This	will	allow	the	parents	and/or	legal	guardians	to	discuss	their	participation	with	others	before	signing	the	written	consent.	3)	Research	staff	will	attend	the	High	Risk	Follow-Up	Clinic	at	CHLA.	A	licensed	healthcare	provider	at	CHLA,	with	the	permission	of	the	parent	or	legal	guardian,	will	introduce	the	research	staff	to	the	family.	The	research	staff	will	give	more	specific	information	about	the	study	and	answer	any	questions.	If	they	choose	to	participate	after	the	initial	contact,	a	written	consent	form	will	be	mailed	to	them.	This	will	allow	the	parents	and/or	legal	guardians	to	discuss	their	participation	with	others	before	signing	the	written	consent.	4)	A	CHLA	Clinical	Research	Coordinator	(CRC)	will	coordinate	with	the	High	Risk	Follow	Up	Clinic	and	potentially	the	NICU	to	review	infants'	medical	records	for	eligibility	and	speak	to	families	of	potential	participants.	With	the	permission	of	the	parent	or	legal	guardian,	the	CRC	will	provide	the	research	staff	with	the	contact	[CONTACT_2997].	Research	staff	will	call	the	parent	or	legal	guardian	and	give	more	specific	information	about	the	study	and	answer	any	questions.	If	they	choose	to	participate	after	the	initial	contact,	a	written	consent	form	will	be	mailed	to	them.	This	will	allow	the	parents	and/or	legal	guardians	to	discuss	their	participation	with	others	before	signing	the	written	consent.		Inclusion	Criteria.	Infants	will	be	3-[ADDRESS_963883]	visit,	+/-	30	days.	Infants	will	be	defined	as	at	risk	in	accordance	with	the	definition	below	(confirmed	by	[CONTACT_97758]	[INVESTIGATOR_708969])	15:

 4 		Procedures.	A	parent	or	legal	guardian	will	sign	an	informed	consent	form	prior	to	their	infant’s	participation.	They	will	receive	the	consent	form	to	review	and	will	have	any	questions	answered	before	scheduling	a	visit.	At	the	time	of	the	visit,	they	will	inspect	all	equipment	and	toys	have	any	questions	answered	before	signing	the	consent	form.	A	caregiver	will	be	present	and	engaged	throughout	the	data	collection	visit,	which	lasts	approximately	1	hour	in	their	home,	or,	if	they	prefer,	in	our	laboratory.	Infants	will	receive	$20	compensation	and	souvenir	photos	for	each	visit.		Data	Collection.	All	infants	will	be	assessed	in	their	homes	once	per	month	(+	or	–	5	days),	from	3-6	months	of	corrected	age	until	sitting	onset	(can	maintain	independent	sitting	>	30	s)	or	[ADDRESS_963884]	chosen	this	as	our	intervention	endpoint	because	1)	once	sitting	is	established,	the	way	in	which	infants	use	their	legs	shifts	drastically	(from	mostly	supi[INVESTIGATOR_708970])	and	2)	if	they	are	not	sitting	independently	by	[ADDRESS_963885]	clinically	to	identify	significantly	delay.	The	goal	of	our	intervention	is	to	get	them	on	the	“right	track”	early,	not	to	provide	intervention	once	a	significant	delay	has	occurred.	We	have	chosen	to	start	our	intervention	at	[ADDRESS_963886]	been	observed	between	leg	movement	frequency	and	later	functional	outcomes	(as	described	in	the	siginificance	section).	Sensor	Data.	To	record	leg	movement	rate,	infants	will	wear	custom	leg	warmers	with	a	pocket	that	securely	holds	a	movement	sensor	at	each	ankle	from	the	morning	visit	until	bedtime.	The	caregivers	will	remove	the	leg	warmers	and	sensors	when	they	put	their	infant	to	bed	for	the	night	(~10-12	hours	later).	We	will	return	to	pi[INVESTIGATOR_708971].	Amount	and	type	of	leg	movements	will	be	determoned	using	our	exitisting,	validated	software	algorithms.	Assessments.	We	will	measure	the	infant’s	weight,	length,	head	circumference,	thigh	and	shank	lengths	and	circumferences.	We	will	document	medical	and	therapy	interventions	being	received	and	assess	motor	skills	using	the	Alberta	Infant	Motor	Scale	(AIMS),	a	standardized,	norm-referenced	observational	scale16.	We	will	record	[ADDRESS_963887]	the	caregiver	teaching	the	child	a	novel	task	and	assess	the	caregiver-infant	interaction	using	the	Nursing	Child	Assessment	Teaching	Scale	(NCAST),	a	evidence	based	standardized-assement	tool17.			Intervention.	At	each	visit,	the	caregiver	will	be	reminded	of	the	infant’s	movement.	The	research	team	will	spend	15	minutes	interacting	with	the	caregiver	to	determine	possible	ways	to	achieve	the	goal	of	1200	movements	per	hour	of	awake	time,	with	a	variety	of	movements.	Strategies	to	increase	leg	movements	will	be	encouraged	based	on	the	infant’s	developmental	level	and	what	they	demonstrate	a	response	to,	including:	shake	a	toy	when	infant	moves	legs,	sing	a	line	of	a	song	when	infant	moves	legs,	change	the	position	of	the	infant	to	encourage	more	leg	movement,	or	lightly	tickle	the	legs	and	feet	of	the	infant.	The	intervention	will	use	the	GAME	(Goals	-	Activity	-	Motor	Enrichment)	protocol,	a	motor	learning,	environmental	enrichment	intervention	that	has	recently	been	shown	to	be	effective	for	improving	motor	skills	in	infants	at	high	risk	of	cerebral	palsy	compared	to	standard	care.	The	intervention	is	based	on	the	principles	of	active	motor	learning,	family	centred	care,	parent	coaching	and	environmental	enrichment.	Intervention	was	customised	to	parent	goals	and	enrichment	style	and	the	child’s	motor	ability.	To	increase	the	dose	of	motor	practice	families	were	provided	with	a	home	program	containing	suggested	activities	according	to	identified	goals14,18,19.	We	are	expanding	this	effective	intervention	by	[CONTACT_708983]	a	new	population	(infants	broadly	at	risk	as	opposed	to	specifically	at	risk	for	cerebral	palsy)	and	by	[CONTACT_708984]	(amount	and	type).	Otherwise,	all	intervention	will	be	consistent	with	the	established,	published	protocol.	A	customized	logbook	of	all	exercises	with	demonstration	pi[INVESTIGATOR_708972],	instructions,	and	tracking	(amount	and	type)	will	be	provided	to	the	family	each	visit.	Example	Intervention	Strategy.	The	research	team	and	family	determine	that	the	baby	[CONTACT_708985]	“You	are	my	sunshine”.	They	decide	that	every	time	the	baby’s	diaper	is	changed,	Mom	will	demonstrate	by	[CONTACT_708986]	
 5 producing	alternating	kicks	while	smiling	and	singing	for	10	total	alternating	kicks	(5	each	leg)	and	then	encouraging	the	baby	[CONTACT_708987]	(not	assisting)	for	[ADDRESS_963888]	intentions,	however,	logbooks	are	often	incomplete;	the	GAME	study	reported	~	50%	completion	19.	Our	main	fidelity	measure	in	this	study	will	be	the	movement	rate	and	proportion	of	unilateral	movements	demonstrated	by	[CONTACT_708988].	We	will	be	able	to	compare	these	data	to	our	existing	obervational	data	to	measure	the	intervention	effect	size.			Follow	Up:	Families	will	be	contact[CONTACT_708989]	3-[ADDRESS_963889]	visit	until	24	months	of	corrected	age	for	updates	on	their	child's	medical	and	developmental	status.		Statistical	test	and	analyses	were	performed	using	SPSS	(Version	24;	IBM,	Corporation,	Armonk,	NY,	[LOCATION_003]).	We	first	checked	all	variables	for	normality	by	[CONTACT_708990].	Given	the	sample	size	and	visual	inspection	of	the	variables,	we	chose	to	analyze	our	data	using	non-parametric	statistics.	The	median	and	range	were	used	to	represent	all	descriptive	statistics	for	the	first	and	last	visit.	Wilcoxon	Signed	Ranked	tests	(alpha	=	0.05)	were	used	to	compare	the	leg	movement	rates,	adherence,	and	NCAST-Teaching	total	score	to	test	for	significant	differences	between	the	first	and	last	visits.	Spearman	rank	order	correlations	(alpha	=	0.05)	were	used	to	test	for	significant	relationships	between	quality	of	caregiver-child	interaction	and	adherence	to	the	intervention	and	leg	movement	rate	at	all	visits.			Sample	size	justification.	We	determined	our	sample	size	of	[ADDRESS_963890]	sizes	(Cohen’s	d	=	0.8	–	1.3)	for	leg	movement	quantity	(movements	per	hour	of	awake	time)	between	12	infants	with	TD	and	24	infants	AR	(anticipate	~12	good	and	~12	poor	neuromotor	outcomes).	With	the	planned	primary	comparison	of	leg	movement	of	those	who	received	intervention	(N	=	12)	versus	those	who	did	not	(N	=	24),	we	should	be	able	to	detect	an	effect	of	Cohen’s	d	of	1.0	at	9	months,	with	alpha	=	0.05	and	80%	power.			Potential	Risks	Wearable	Sensors:	There	is	a	small	risk	of	skin	irritation	from	wearing	the	legwarmers	all	day.	Parents	will	be	able	to	visually	see	their	infants’	feet	at	all	times	(they	are	not	covered)	and	can	remove	the	legwarmers	briefly	as	desired	to	inspect	their	infant’s	skin.	Although	the	movement	sensors	are	small,	they	are	not	small	enough	to	present	a	choking	hazard.	They	measure	1.[ADDRESS_963891]	guidelines.20				Storage	of	Materials.	There	is	a	small	risk	of	disclosure	of	participant’s	personal	information.	Data	collected	from	participants	includes	biological	data	of	leg	movement	activity,	video	recordings	and	health	status	information.	All	information	collected	will	be	kept	private	and	secure.	Password	protection	and	secure	internal	computer	networks	and	REDCap,	a	HIPAA-compliant	database	system	hosted	by	[CONTACT_73726],	will	be	used	to	collect	and	store	data.	Hard	copi[INVESTIGATOR_708973],	including	[ADDRESS_963892]	drives,	will	be	stored	in	a	locked,	waterproof,	fireproof	safe	in	a	locked	room	in	a	secured	building	(keys,	identification	cards)	on	a	secured	campus	(identification	cards,	security	patrol).	Unique	identifier	codes	will	be	used	to	separate	all	data	collected	from	any	personal	identifying	information.	Laboratory	members	will	have	access	to	data	identified	by	[CONTACT_708991],	while	only	the	PI	[INVESTIGATOR_708974]	(RA)	will	have	access	to	identifying	information	for	participant	tracking	purposes.		Intervention.	As	is	typi[INVESTIGATOR_708975],	there	is	a	risk	that	
 6 the	infant	will	become	distressed	as	the	caregiver	attempts	to	get	the	infant	to	move	his	or	her	legs	more	(the	intervention).	Caregivers	will	be	encouraged	to	soothe	their	infant	and	try	the	intervention	again	at	a	later	time	of	the	day.	If	the	infant	still	becomes	distressed,	the	caregiver	will	make	a	note	of	this	and	not	perform	the	distressing	activity	further.			References		1.	Spi[INVESTIGATOR_708976],	Doyle	LW,	Boyd	RN.

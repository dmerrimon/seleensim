 Protocol Title:  Sentinel Lymph Node Localization and Biopsy for Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma 
of the Eyelid 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_734125]   
 
1.0 Objectives  
Primary Objectives:  
a) Identify the rate of SLN (sentinel lymph node) positivity for eyelid sebaceous gland 
carcinomas.  
b) Identify the false negative events associated with SLN biopsy for sebaceous gland 
carcinomas.  
Secondary Objective:  
Record any side effects associated with SLN biopsy for sebaceous gland carcinoma of the 
eyelid.  
2.0 Background  
Sebaceous gland carcinoma of the eyelid is a rare cancer with a tendency for regional nodal 
metastasis.  Clinically obvious regional nodal metastasis is detected in 10- 20% of patients with 
sebaceous gland carcinoma of the eyelid according to most series.  
Sentinel lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_734126] a technique that has been successful in identifying patients with cutaneous melanoma who have microscopic regional lymph node metastasis.  An early therapeutic lymph node dissection is subsequent ly performed 
in patients proven to harbor occult metastatic disease.  This technique is well characterized for cutaneous melanomas in most locations.  Our group has adapted SLN biopsy technique for conjunctival melanoma and eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma.
5,8-11,[ADDRESS_1003187] on biopsy divided by [CONTACT_734135].  The false negative events refer to recurrence in a lymphatic basin that 
was previously deemed to harbor a "negative" SLN within the first 3 years of follow -up. 
3.0 Patient Eligibility  
Inclusion Criteria:  
a)   Participant must be 18 years of age or over.  
b)   Possible or Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_734127].

 c)   A CXR (chest x -ray), liver enzymes, and a head and neck CT ,a (SPECT/CT) or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , and an ultrasound negative for clinical evidence of   
 metastasis.  
d)   Patient provided written informed consent.  In the event that non- English   
 speaking participants are eligible for this study, a short form (if applicable)   
 or an ICD in their language, will be utilized and completed in accordance   
 with the MDACC Policy for Consenting Non- English Speaking Participants.  
Exclusion Criteria:  
a) Pregnant or nursing females.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1003189] /CT scan  and an ultrasound of regional nodes are 
obtained to establish lack of clinically identifiable metastatic disease.  The patient's ability to undergo surgery under general anesthesia will also be evaluated/assessed at this time.  The 
eligible patients then undergo preoperative lymphoscintigraphy.  
NOTE:  A serum/blood pregnancy test (i.e., 10cc’s) will be obtained, within [ADDRESS_1003190] will be obtained.  If beta hcg is out of 
range a second time, a gynecologic consult will be obtained.  
Women of child- bearing potential (WOCBP) include any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, 
bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal [defined as 
amenorrhea  12 consecutive months; or women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) 
with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level  35mIU/mL].  Even women who are using oral, implanted or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products 
such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to 
prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy), 
should be considered to be of child bearing potential.  
5.[ADDRESS_1003191]/CT will be obtained in the Nuclear Medicine Department following standard of care

 protocols at MD Anderson Cancer Center. .  At this point transmission images of the head 
and neck region will be performed.  
Intra-operative Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_734128], 0. 15-0.2 cc (0. 3-0.4 mCi) of Tc99m -Sulfur colloid will be injected 
intradermally around the primary lesion approximately one hour prior to the procedure, only 
if it has been more than [ADDRESS_1003193] transcutaneously before a small skin inc ision is made over the 
corresponding nodal basin(s), and identification of a SLN is attempted.  An SLN is defined 
as one that collects radiolabeled colloid (at least twice background) within a regional nodal basin.  The maximal ex -vivo counts per second ar e recorded for each SLN.  The SLN 
harvest is considered to be complete when radiotracer uptake in the draining nodal basin(s) is less than twice background.  All patients will undergo wide local excision of the eyelid 
sebaceous gland carcinoma if needed during the same anesthesia session.  
The intradermal injection of Tc99m -Sulfur colloid as well as resection of the eyelid tumor will 
be done by [CONTACT_978].  The intraoperative localization of SLN will be performed by a surgeon from Surgical Oncology or from Head & Neck Surgery.  
Excised SLNs are analyzed following the same methodology as in other anatomic locations.  
Briefly, the SLNs are breadloafed at 2 mm interval.  Formalin- fixed, paraffin- embedded and 
serially sections at 4- µm intervals are obtained.  Initially, one hematoxil in and eosin (H&E) 
stained slide is examined by [CONTACT_734136].  If a metastasis is identified, the diagnosis is rendered.  In the report, the size (two dimensions) of the largest metastatic focus, the 
localization of metastasis (subscapular, intraparenchymal or both) and the presence or 
absence of the extracapsular extension will be included.  If metastasis is not identified in the 
initial H&E section, a serial level will be obtained and another H&E -stained slide will be 
examined, along with an immunohistochemical study performed on paraffin- embedded 
sections.  The immunohistochemical study will include  a pan -keratin cocktail (containing 
antibodies against high and low molecular -weight keratins), as well as antisera against 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_734129] (EMA).  The combination of immunohistochemical studies is performed in order to expand the sensitivity of sebaceous carcinoma metastases detection method in SLNs.  
6.0 Evaluation During Study 
An ophthalmologic exam to check for recurrence of the eyelid tumor is undertaken every 
three months (+/ - 6 weeks) during the first year and every 6 months (+/ - 6 weeks) during 
years 2 -5.  A CXR will be performed 1 year (+/ - 6 weeks) after removal of the pr imary tumor.  
A head and neck CT or MRI or a SPECT /CT scan is done once every 6 months (+/ - 6 
weeks) during the first year and then once a year (+/ - 6 weeks), thereafter and as needed.  
An ultrasound of regional nodes will be repeated 1 year (+/ - 6 weeks) after removal of 
primary tumor.

 A study participant's inability to comply with study policies and procedures, including the 
inability to comply with recommended follow up visits and testing, will be withdrawn from the 
study by [CONTACT_9154].  
7.[ADDRESS_1003195] biopsy for periocular tumors is the likelihood of 
involvement of the preauricular (parotid) lymph nodes and the risk of da mage to the facial 
nerve during the dissection and biopsy.  In our experience so far, in over [ADDRESS_1003196] is about 15% and the estimated rate of false negative events is 8%.  
Based on these assumptions, the widths of 95% binomial confidence intervals based on 20 
patients would be:  5%: 0.25; 10%: 0.30; 15%: 0.35; 20%: 0.38.  
10. Data Analysis  
Data analysis will be done at the end of patient accrual and follow up.

Initial protocol  
 
Protocol Version 1.1  
Date: March 29, 2020  
Substantive protocol changes in V ersion  1.1: 
1. Based on recommendations from FDA, the dose of hydroxychloroquine in the trial was changed 
from hydroxychloroquine 400 mg every 12 hours for 10 doses (version 1) to hydroxychloroquine 
400 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses followed by 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 doses (version 1.1) . 
This change was made before any patients were enrolled  and before the trial was posted on 
clinicaltrials.gov.   
  
Protocol Version 2.0  
Date: April 14 , 2020  
Substantive protocol changes in V ersion  2.0: 
1. Inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_872707] results with a high clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_166489] -19 are no longer eligible. This change was made because SARS -CoV -2 
laboratory results ar e now routinely available within hours of initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650721] (which was not true early in the COVID -19 pandemic).  
2. Exclusion criterion #16 was added.  This exclusion criterion states that a patient is excluded if the 
treating clinical team does not believe equipoise exists regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine 
for treatment of th is patient . 
3. Discussion of  potential drug shortages w as removed because study drug for all sites will be 
supplied by [CONTACT_650768].  
4. Language describing consent processes was revised to increase precision.  
5. Revised the statistical considerations section (Section 7).  
6. Corrected the definition of serious adverse event in section 11.1 to harmonize with secti on 11.3  
7. Added the following statement to Appendix C: “The Medical Monitor will  provide to Sandoz 
Pharmacovigilance any significant safety findings  (without disclosing protected health 
information)  during the conduct of the trial.”     
8. Added Appendix D: Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act  
9. Additional data collection added:  Clinically diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or 
pulmonary embolism (PE)

odds ratio to suggest futility of 1.1 (section 7.1) . 
 
Protocol Version 4.0  
Date: June 4, 2020  
Substantive Changes in Version 4.0  
1. Added languag e for the DMSB to consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650723] (section 7.1): “If we 
determine there is >70% probability that the odds ratio is <0.70, the DSMB should consider 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650723].”  
2. Added language that enrollment will be paused  after 510 participants until the DSMB reviews 
primary outcome  data from all 510 participants.

Analysis  The primary analysis will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the primary 
outcome between patients randomized to hydroxychloroquine versus placebo 
using a proportional odds model. An odds ratio (OR)  >1.0 indicates more 
favorable outcomes with hydroxychloroquine on the COVID Ordinal Outcome 
scale, while an OR <1.0 indicates more favorable outcomes with placebo . The 
trial is designed with a Bayesian monitoring plan and has an anticipated sample 
size around 510 patients. The suggeste d stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650729]: > 95% probability that the OR  is >1.0 with a skeptical prior 
distribution (stop for efficacy); >90% probability that the OR is <1.1 with a flat 
prior (stop for futility); or >70% probability that the O R is <0.7 with a flat prior 
(stop for harm). With 5 interim analyses, a simulation showed that over 90% of 
trials would show efficacy on or before the fifth interim analysis (510 patients) if 
the true odds ratio were 1.8. Meanwhile, 6% of trials would show  efficacy, and 
77% would stop for futility if the odds ratio were 1.0.  If the trial enrolls 510 
participants, further enrollment will be paused until the DSMB reviews data on 
the primary outcome from all enrolled pa rticipants; a decision to continue 
enroll ment will be made by [CONTACT_650770].   
 
  
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 12 of 53  2. TRIAL  DESCRIPTION 
2.1 Background  
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) is an acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_563099] 2  (SARS -CoV -2).1,[ADDRESS_872712] adults with COVID -19 appear to experience fever, cough, and fatigue and then recover 
within 1 -3 weeks.  However, a portion of adults with COVID -19 deve lop severe illness, typi[INVESTIGATOR_563100], with continued progression to acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) and death in some cases.1–[ADDRESS_872713] been 
demonstrated to prevent progression of COVID -19 to severe illness.  Based on mechanism of action and 
early clinical experiences, several agents currently available in the [LOCATION_002] (US) have been proposed 
as potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_650730].4–[ADDRESS_872714] a zoonotic 
origin , although the specific reservoir and  intermediary species remain unclear.9  The COVID- 19 
infection represents the seventh coronavirus known to cause disease in humans.10  Four of the 
coronaviruses viruses are known to cause symptoms of the common cold in immunocompetent 
individuals while two other s (SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV) have caused recent outbreaks of severe and 
sometimes fatal respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748].[ADDRESS_872715] common reasons for ICU care  are respi[INVESTIGATOR_563110], with a minority 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_563103].17 The case fatality rate is estimated to be  0.25% to 
3.0%.[ADDRESS_872716] common side effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, 
and headache.  Mechanisms of action include: 1) immunomodulation: decreased inflammatory response 
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 13 of 53  via inhibition of IL1, IL6, and tumor necrosis factor and impairment of complement -dependent antigen -
antibody reactions; 2) antimalarial: increasing pH of the vacuole within malaria parasites preventing 
normal growth and replication; and 3) antiviral: increasing endosomal pH, which limits virus -cell fusion 
and in terferes with glycosylation of cell receptors targeted by [CONTACT_650771].4,5,19,[ADDRESS_872717] adults with COVID -19 recover without complication s, 
patients who require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650731]. In case series of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139096]- 19, up to 26% require ICU admission and up to 17% die in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].24,[ADDRESS_872718] in finding 
effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265], specifically, in repurposing approved medications with  widespread  availability 
and known safety  profile s.3,26  Potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_650732], 
chloroquine, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, interferon β, and corticosteroids. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650733], 
hydroxychloroquine has been adopted into treatment guidelines in China27 and has been proposed as first -
line therapy for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650734] -[ADDRESS_872719] been proposed as potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_650735]- 19, including remdesivir and azithromycin.   Remdesivir treatment for COVID -19 is being 
studied in a clinical trial sponsored by [CONTACT_80911] (NIAID) 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ]. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is commonly  used in the US for treatment of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. During the design of this protocol, the investigators considered studying 
combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine plus remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin. 
The investigators noted that combination therapy would likely  increase the risk of toxicities. With no 
preliminary data suggesting combination therapy is likely to be more effective than hydroxychloroquine 
monotherapy, the investigators believe the risks of studying combination therapy likely outweigh the 
benefits a t this time.  Additionally, results of a trial evaluating combination therapy may be difficult to 
interpret.  Trial results suggesting effectiveness would probably not be attributable to a single agent and 
would leave uncertainty about whether treatment wit h combination therapy is preferable to monotherapy. 
Furthermore, null results of a trial evaluating combination therapy could occur if neither agent is 
effective, if one is effective and one is detrimental, or if both are effective but there are unfavorabl e drug -
drug interactions .  Interpretation of a trial of one agent will be straightforward and may provide the basis 
for subsequent trial s of combination therapy. The investigators note that two distinct, simultaneously 
conducted placebo- controlled randomiz ed trials evaluating remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine separately 
will provide high quality data on the effectiveness and safety of each agent versus placebo .

following: amiodarone; cimetidine; dofetilide; phenobarbital; phenytoin; sotalol  
12. Receipt of >1 dose of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the 10 days prior to enrollment  
13. Inability to receive entera l medications  
14. Refusal or i nability to be contact[CONTACT_7699] 15 for clinical outcome assessment  if discharged prior 
to Day 15  
15. Previous enrollment in this trial  
16. The treating clinical team does not believe equipoise exists regarding the use of 
hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of this patient  
3.3 Justification of Exclusion Criteria 
The exclusion criteria are primarily designed for patient safety.  In addition to excluding specific 
vulnerable populations (e.g., prisoners), these criteria are designed to exclude patients for whom receipt of 
hydroxychloroquine might increase the risk of serious adverse events.  For example, patients wh o have a  
prolonged QTc or are taking medications that would  increase the risk of experiencing a prolonged QTc 
when combined with hydroxychloroquine are excluded to minimize the risk of Torsades de Pointes.  
3.4 Screening  
The s ite investigator or delegate wi ll screen for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105458] s with laboratory confirmed COVID -
19 (that is, a positive laboratory test for SARS -CoV -2) or a pending SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_872722] the site investigator or delegate for patient s with a high clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_166489] -19.   
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 16 of 53  3.5 Assessment of Eligibility and Exclusion Tracking  
For patients who appear to meet inclusion  criteria  during screening , an electronic case report form will be 
completed to determine eligibility and track exc lusions.  The electronic case report form will be accessed 
and stored in the electronic database.  A t the time of entry into the screening database, the patient will be 
assigned  a screening number.  
If a patient appears to meet all eligibility criteria, the site investigator or delegate will approach the 
treating clinician to  ask permission to approach the patient or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) 
to confirm eligibility, discuss potential stu dy recruitment, and proceed with informed consent.   
For all excluded patients, including refusal by [CONTACT_650773]/surrogate, a small number 
of de -identified variables will be collected including  month and year  the patient met screening  criteria, 
age, sex, ethnicity, patient location, and reason(s)  patient  was excluded.   For the safety of research 
personnel  and conservation of personal protective equipment , these encounters may occur via telephone 
or videophone.  
3.6 Process of Obtaining  Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained from the patient or from a surrogate decision maker if the patient lacks 
decision -making capacity.    
In some instances, b ringing a paper consent form and pen to the bedside of a patient with known or 
suspected COVID -19 and then taking these out of the room would  violate infection control principles and 
policies .  Given the infectious risk from COVID -19 and potential  shortages of personal pr otective 
equipment (PPE), there is a moral and practical imperative to minimize face -to-face contact  [CONTACT_650774]- clinical personnel .  The current epi[INVESTIGATOR_650737]’s legally authoriz ed representative (LAR).  To minimize infectious risk, many  
institutions are not allowing visitors to enter the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Furthermore, the LAR is likely to have been 
exposed to the patient and may therefore be under self -quarantine at the time of the infor med consent  
discussion.  
Therefore, in addition to the traditional approach of an in- person consent discussion and signed paper 
informed consent document , we will allow use  of “no- touch”  consent  procedures for this trial .  Below, we 
outline three examples of no -touch consent procedures that may be used:  (a)  a paper -based  approach;  (b) 
an electronic /e-consent  approach ; and (c) attestation of informed consent .   
 
3.6.1 Paper -based approach 
1. The informed consent document is delivered to the patient or  LAR . 
a. If the patient or LAR is on -site, the informed consent document many be delivered to the 
patient or LAR either by [CONTACT_274423]  
b. If the LAR is off -site, the informed consent document may be emailed, faxed, or 
otherwise electronic ally transferred to the LAR (method dictated by [CONTACT_10569])  
2. Research staff discuss the informed consent document  with the patient  or LAR either in -person or 
by [CONTACT_191648] .  This step confirms subject/LAR identity.  
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 17 of 53  3. If the patient or LAR  decides to consent  to participate , the patient  or LAR signs the  paper copy of 
the informed consent document.  
4. A photograph is taken of the signature [CONTACT_650809] (e.g. REDCap).  
a. If using the patient’s device (such as a patient’s personal cellular phone) , a survey link 
can be sent to their device  to allow direct upload of the image into the electronic database 
(e.g. REDC ap). 
b. If using a staff device, it must be approved to store PHI by [CONTACT_7848]. In that 
case, research personnel can take a photograph of the signature [CONTACT_563020]’s room .  The photograph can then be uploaded into the electronic database.  If a 
staff device is taken into the patient’s room to take a photograph it must be able to be 
disinfected according to local institutional practices.  
5. Research staff and witness prov ide signatures within the electronic database (e.g. REDCap) 
confirming their participation in the informed consent process.  
6. The patient or LAR retains the paper consent document.  The image of the signature [CONTACT_650810] a copy of the  blank informed consent document  for research records.  
 
3.6.2 Electronic/e -consent  approach  
1. The electronic informed consent document is opened on a research device or a link for the 
electronic informed consent  document  is sent to the patient’s or LAR ’s dev ice. 
2. Research staff discuss the informed consent document with the patient  or LAR  either in person or  
by [CONTACT_191648] .  This step confirms subject/LAR identity.  
3. If the  patient or LAR decides to consent to participate the patient  or LAR signs the electronic 
informed consent document.  This  signature [CONTACT_650811]: 
a. an actual signature (often tracing a  finger on the screen) OR  
b. a username [CONTACT_650812]  
4. Research staff and witness provide signatures within the electronic database (e.g., REDCap) 
confirming their participation in the informed consent process.  
5. The image of the signature [CONTACT_650813] a copy of the blank inf ormed 
consent document  for research records.  
 
If a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191569] -based consent, that device will be 
disinfected according to institutional protocols and removed by [CONTACT_650775]’s room. 
This approach complies with relevant regulations and sub- regulator guidance at 45 CFR 46.117, 45 CFR 
164.512, 21 CFR 11 Subpart C (11.100 –11.300) , https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations -and-
policy/guidance/use -electronic- informed -consent -questions -and-answers/index.html , 
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory- information/search -fda-guidance -docum ents/informed -consent  
The information for the informed consent discussion will be provided in a formal document (or electronic 
equivalent) that has been approved by [CONTACT_274427] a language comprehensible to the potential 
participant, using an interpreter  if necessary. The information presented in the consent form and by [CONTACT_650776] s, including any

from the trial at any time for any reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give 
the reason for withdrawal. Where a patient does not speak English, a short -form consent and qualified 
interpreter will be employed, using similar “no- touch” principles .  Use of an interpreter and the 
interpreter’s identity will be documented on the electronic consent.  
3.6.3 Attestation of informed consent  
If none of the options outlined above (traditional signature [CONTACT_191707] a paper consent form, electronic 
photographs of a signed consent page, or  e-consent) are available, study personnel may attest to 
completion of the informed consent process using t he procedures outlined below.  Importantly, the 
process of informed consent using this attestation option should not change compared with the traditional 
method of obtaining informed consent for trial participation except for the method of documenting the 
consent process in the research record .  Rather than storing a paper document with the participant ’s 
signature, a member of the research team and an impartial witness will attest  to completion of the 
informed consent process and that the participant signed  the informed consent document. This option of 
attestation of informed  consent is not available when obtaining consent through an LAR.   
Procedures for attestation of informed consent:  
1. An unsigned paper consent form is provided to the patient by a heath ca re worker or study 
member . 
2. The study member obtaining consent  arranges an in- person meeting or three -way call or video 
conference with himself/herself, the patient, and an impartial witness.  If desired and  feasible, 
additional people  requested by [CONTACT_180186] (e.g., next of kin)  may also join this discussion.  
3. Study member  reviews consent and answers questions in the presence of the impartial witness . 
4. Patient signs the paper informed consent document while the witness is listening on the phone or 
directly obs erving.  
5. Patient provides verbal confirmation that he/she  would like to participate in the trial and he/she  
has signed and dated the informed consent document . This signed informed consent document 
stays with the patient due to the risk of spreading the vir us.   
6. Study member and witness attest  that other techniques for documenting informed consent were 
not available for this participant and that the participant provided written informed consent for 
trial participation by [CONTACT_2960] a paper informed consent document.  A n attestation form is available 
in the ORCHID REDCap tool kit for documenting this attestation.  This attestation page with 
signatures from the study member and witness will be save as evidence of the informed consent 
process.  A signature [CONTACT_191708].   
   
3.[ADDRESS_872723] provided informed consent  will be 
randomized 1:[ADDRESS_872724] a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access the 
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_872725] will receive a computer -generated randomization ID number.  The 
computer -generated randomization ID number will be provided to the pharmacy who will provide a dose 
pack containing hydroxychloroquine or placebo.  The participant, treating clinicians, study personnel , and 
outcome assessors will all remain  blinded to group assignment until after the database is locked  and 
blinded analysis is completed . 
3.8 Minorities and Women  
No patients will be excluded on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex. The clinical coordinating center  will 
monitor recruitment of minorities and women. If necessary, additional recruitment efforts will be made to 
ensure that the aggregate patient sample contains representative race/ethnicity and sex subsets.  
 
4. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
4.1 Treatment of S tudy P articipants  
A summary of the trial ’s schedule of events is included in Appendix A.  
Timing of study procedures is based on the time of randomization, which is defined as “Time 0” .    The 
primary outcome will be assessed on Study Day 15, which corresponds to 14 days (2 weeks) after 
randomization .  
Study medications will be administered by [CONTACT_650777][INVESTIGATOR_057]. 
The first dose of study medicatio ns will be administered within [ADDRESS_872726] dose will correspond to the timing of morning and evening medication 
delivery for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/unit.  If the patient is discharged prior to comple tion of the study medication, the 
patient will be discharged with the study medication packet to complete the course after discharge. At 
home , the patient will be instructed to take the morning dose upon awakening and the evening dose 
approximately 12 hour s later.  
On S tudy D ays 1 -5, study personnel  will review patient records to confirm administration of study drug 
and document the number and reason for any missed doses.  For patients who are discharged prior to D ay 
5, study personnel  will obtain data on s tudy drug adherence and safety outcomes from the patient or 
surrogate at via telephone follow -up scheduled at Day 8. Research personnel will also assess patients at 
Day 15 and Day 29 ; these assessments will be completed by [CONTACT_650778][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
4.[ADDRESS_872727] two doses and then 200 mg twice daily for the subsequent eight doses  
(“Days 2 – 5”).   This dosing regimen is a total of [ADDRESS_872728] 24 
hours divided in to two doses followed by 400 mg daily divided into two doses over the following 4 days .  
Medication dose packs containing all 10 doses will be provided at randomization by [CONTACT_650779].  
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 20 of 53  Hydroxychloroquine is available in 200 mg oral tablets of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Common 
hydroxychloroquine dosing for treatment of uncomplicated malaria is 800 mg followed by 400 mg at 6 
hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours. Common initial dosing for rheumatoid arthritis is 400 mg to 600 mg daily. 
For this COVID- 19 trial, we selected  a dose of hydroxychloroquine ([ADDRESS_872729] two 
doses followed by 200 mg twice daily for next 8 doses ) based on similar doses being well tolerated in the 
treatment of other conditions  and in vitro  studies suggesting  that SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_872730] day followed by 400 mg for the following 4 days.5  This dose and duration is  
comparable to the dose and duration being administered empi[INVESTIGATOR_650738] -19 as a part 
of clinical care during the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].          
4.3 Control Group  
Participants randomized to the control group will receive matching  placebo ente rally twice daily  matching 
the dosing regimen described above for hydroxychloroquine .  Medication dose packs containing all 10 
doses will be provided at randomization by [CONTACT_156979].  The placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_650739].  
4.4 Co- Interventions  
This trial will c ontrol the use of hydroxychloroquine vs placebo during the 5- day intervention period.  
Enrolled participants will not receive open -label hydroxychloroquine  or chloroquine  during the 5- day 
intervention period. All other treatment decisions will be made by t reating clinicians without influence 
from the protocol.  Administration of other antiviral medications (“rescue therapy”) will be allowed.  The 
decision to administer other antiviral medications will be made by [CONTACT_650780].   The decision to administer immunomodulating medications, including 
corticosteroids, will be made by [CONTACT_650781].   
4.[ADDRESS_872731]  an assessment of the QTc with an 
electrocardiogram (EKG) or rhythm strip performed [ADDRESS_872732] daily for 
potential medication interactions with hydroxychloroquine (see Appendix B ).  If a medication  that is 
considered to be contraindicated with hydroxychloroquine is discovered, treating clinician s will be 
contact[CONTACT_650782][INVESTIGATOR_650740] .  If a medicati on with a potential interaction with hydroxychloroquine is identified, study 
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_872733] er entry  system  to automatically screen for medication 
interactions with hydroxychloroquine and notify ordering providers of the potential interaction at the time 
of order entry.  
4.6 Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_401570] (a) adverse 
events, (b) results of on -study monitoring, (c) clinical deterioration , or (d) evidence of an alternative cause 
to the patient’s symptoms .   
If a patient experiences an adverse event that the patie nt (or legally authorized representative), treating 
clinicians, or investigators feel merits temporarily or permanently stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648], the study drug 
will be stopped . The explanation for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650741] , and 
the adverse event will be recorded and reported according to the adverse event guidelines below .  If the 
adverse event resolves to the extent that the patient (or legally authorized representative), treating 
clinicians, and investigators f eel that resuming the study drug is appropriate, the study drug will be 
resumed, and this information will be recorded in the case report form.   
If a QTc assessed after  randomization is >500 ms, the study drug will be discontinued for 24 hours and a 
repea t EKG will be performed daily until either the QTc is less than 5 00 ms, at which time study drug is 
resumed until 5 days after randomization with daily QTc assessments, or until 5 days after randomization  
is reached without resumption of study drug.  Both the  value for the  QTc and the decision to continue or 
stop the study drug will be recorded in the case report form. If the QTc in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650742] 24- 48 hours, study drug will be discontinued until the QTc can be assessed.  If th e daily on-
study monitoring by [CONTACT_563157] a potential interaction with a 
medication that treating clinicians feel is required for the optimal treatment of the patient and with which 
treating clinicians and the inv estigator feel it would be unsafe to administer hydroxychloroquine   
(including but not limited to: amiodarone; cimetidine; chloroquine; dofetilide; phenobarbital; phenytoin ; 
sotalol) , the study drug will be stopped and the reason will be recorded in the ca se report form.  
Patients on study may experience clinical deterioration  due to their illness.  Clinical deterioration will be 
defined as a decrease of 1 point or more on the ordinal scale for the primary outcome (e.g., patient 
transitions from “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18552] d on supplemental oxygen” to “ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339951]- invasive ventilation or 
high flow nasal cannula”).  Patients who experience clinical deterioration in either group may be 
administered other antivirals or immunomodulators as “rescue therapy”.  For patients  who experience 
clinical deterioration for w hich treating clinicians feel optimal care would be to stop the study drug, 
unblind group assignment, and administer hydroxychloroquine to patients in the placebo group, the study 
drug will be stopped, the site investigator will contact [CONTACT_650783] 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 22 of 53  study group assignment, and any additional treatment will be deferred to treating clinicians .  In this 
situation, the following data will be recorded in the case report form: t he criteria met for clinical 
deterioration ; the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_563123] ; use of hydroxychloroquine, other 
antivirals, and immunomodulators ; and study outcomes . Crossovers from placebo to open- label 
hydroxychloroquine will be recorded and reported to the DSMB at DSMB reviews and interim analyses.  
Before implementation of protocol version 2.0, patients could be enrolled with a pending SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_872734] result if clinical criterial were present suggesting a high likelihood of COVID -19. In these patients, i f 
SARS -CoV -2 results return ed negative  and the clinical team identifie d a likely alternative cause of the 
patient’s clinical syndrome, the clinical team could elect to stop administration of the study drug. If the 
study drug was stopped for this reason, the timing and reason for study drug dis continuation was 
recorded.   After implementation of protocol version 2.0, only patients with laboratory- confirmed SARS -
CoV -2 infection are eligible.

order to determine incident cases of cognitive impairment, post -traumatic stress disorder, and depression, 
baseline data will be collected from the subject’s family member or friend or the subject him/herself. 
Details of ORCHID- BUD study procedures are described in Appendix E.  
 
7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
7.1 Statistical Approach  
The primary analysis will be an intention- to-treat comparison of the Day 15 COVID Ordinal Outcome 
score between patients randomized to hydroxychloroquine versus placebo.  This analysis will be 
conducted with a proportional odds model using the Day 15 COVID  Ordinal Outcome score as the 
dependent variable, randomized group assignment as the primary independent variable, and the following 
co-variables: age, sex, baseline COVID Ordinal Outcome score, baseline SOFA score, and duration of 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_650749].  An odds ratio >1.0 indicates more favorable 
outcomes with hydroxychloroquine on the COVID Ordinal Outcome scale, while an odds ratio <1.[ADDRESS_872737] laboratory confirmed 
SARS -CoV -2 infection will be included in the primary intention to treat analysis. In additional to 
reporting data for the full trial population we will also report data separately for  patients randomized in 
the ICU (who tend to be more severely ill) and those randomized outside the ICU (who tend to be less 
severely ill)  as well as those with duration of symptoms ≤5 days prior to randomization and those with >[ADDRESS_872738] 
error of the log(odds -ratio) statistic with 5 1 patients per arm based on data from a recently completed trial 
within the PETAL Network that enrolled patients early in the course of critical illness, the Vitamin D to 
Improve Outcomes by [CONTACT_259361]  (VIOLET) trial .35 In the VIOLET trial at Day 15, 
11.5% of patients had died, 5.8% were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 22.9% remained in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and the remaining had been discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Table 1). We used these outcomes in 
VIOLET to approximate Day 15 outcomes on the COVID Ordinal Outcome scale that we may observe in 
this trial.

ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 27 of 53   
We plan to use a Bayesian analysis of the evolving data which allows flexibility in the number and timing 
of the interim analyses.  If we determine there is >95% probability of the odds ratio being >1.0, the 
DSMB should consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_264107]. If we determine there is >90% probability that the 
odds ratio is <1. 1, the DSMB should consider stop pi[INVESTIGATOR_48621].  If we determine there is >70% 
probability that the odds ratio is <0.70, the DSMB should consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650723]. We will 
use a prior odds ratio of 1.0 (equal chance of harm and benefit ; mean log OR of 0.0)  and a prior 
distributio n of the standard error for its log set at 0.352  for tests of efficacy and a non -informative prior 
for tests of futility  and harm . The results will be reported in a similar manner to those published by 
[CONTACT_650785].36    One advantage of Bayesian analysis is that stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650750].  
 
If the trial enrolls 510 participants, further enrollment will be paused until the DSMB reviews data on the 
primary outcome from all enrolled participants; a decision to continue enrollment will be made by 
[CONTACT_650786].   
 
We calculat ed probabilities that this trial would stop for efficacy or futility based on several fixed 
scenarios assuming we had an interim analysis after each 102 patients.  The probabilities for continuing, 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34303], and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650751] a true odds ratio of 1.0 (no difference between the 
hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups) and 1.8 (substantially better outcomes in the 
hydroxychloroquine group) are show in Table 2 and Table 3.

8. DATA QUALITY MONITORING AND STORAGE  
8.1 Data Quality Monitoring 
Data quality will be reviewed remotely using front -end range and logic checks at the time of data entry 
and back- end monitoring of data using application programming interface tools connecting the online 
database  to statistical software to generate data reports. Patient records and case repor t forms will also be 
examined by [CONTACT_650787] a randomly selected 5- 10% sample  to evaluate the accuracy and 
completeness of the data entered into the database and monitor for protocol compliance .  The 
coordinating center will perform remote monitorin g of each study site to examine the completeness and 
accuracy of informed consent documents for study participants, documentation of eligibility criteria, and 
the completeness of study outcome collection.  
8.2 Data Storage  
Data will be entered into a secure online database.  All data will be maintained in the secure online 
database until the time of study publication.  At the time of publication, a de -identified version of the 
database will be generated.  
 
9. RISK ASSESSMENT  
9.1 Potential Risk to Participants  
Although hydroxychloroquine is an FDA approved medication with an established safety profile 
(described as “among the safest medications used for the treatment of systematic rheumatic disease”),[ADDRESS_872741] to participating in this study of hydroxychloroquine  versus placebo for the treatment 
of COVID- 19.   
9.1.1 Potential risks of receiving hydroxychloroquine   
Potential risks of receiving hydroxychloroquine  can be  classified based on their severity as Major or 
Minor.  Major potential risks of receiving hydroxychloroquine include:  
1) Neurological System  
a) Seizure – Hydroxychloroquine can lower the seizure threshold and co- administration of 
hydroxychloroquine with other m edications known to lower the seizure threshold has been 
reported to increase the risk of seizures.  This trial protocol excludes patients with a seizure 
disorder.  
b) Psychosis – A small number of case reports describe psychosis in patients on long- term treat ment 
with hydroxychloroquine,39 but has not been described with short -term treatment.  
c) Suicidal behavior -  Suicidal behavior  has been rarely reported in patients on long- term treatment 
with hydroxychloroquine for rheumatologic disorders,40 but not with short -term therapy.  
2) Circulatory system  
a) Cardiac arrhythmias  
i) Ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes – Hydroxychloroquine can prolong the QT 
interval and ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de points have been reported in patients 
taking hydroxychloroquine.  This trial protocol excludes patients with a prolonged QTc on 
baseline EKG  and history of prolonged QTc  syndromes , assesses the QTc after receipt of 
study drug, monitors daily for co- administration of medications that prolong the QTc and 
specifies criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650754].  
ii) Cardiomyopathy, sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block, or bundle branch block – 
Cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease have rarely been reported among patients on 
long- term hydroxychloroquine,[ADDRESS_872742] not been reported among patients receiving less 
than 3 months of therapy.  
3) Digestive system  
a) Liver injury – Fulminant hepatic failure has been reported in at least two cases from long -term 
administration of hydroxychloroquine .42  Porphyria cutanea tarda appears to be a risk factor for 
liver injury from hydroxychloroquine.  This trial protocol excludes patients with porphyria 
cutanea tarda.  
b) Increased cyclosporine or digoxin levels – h ydroxychloroquine can increase levels of 
cyclosporine or digoxin for patients being co- administered these medications.  This trial protocol 
monitors daily for receipt of medications that interact with hydroxychloroquine and notifies 
treating clinicians abo ut potential medication interactions.  
4) Endocrine system  
a) Symptomatic hypoglycemia – hydroxychloroquine can increase risk of hypoglycemia, especially 
when co- administered with antidiabetic agents, although this is rarely observed in clinical 
practice.43 
5) Integumentary system  
a) Severe dermatologic reactions – A mild dermatologic reaction occurs in approximately 10 percent 
of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, but severe dermatologic reactions such as Steven’s 
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 31 of 53  Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_650755].  For example, in one recent case 
series of patients on hydroxychloroquine with dermatologic r eactions, none of the reported 
reactions were severe.44 
6) Hematological system  
a) Neutropenic, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia – Rare toxicities of hydroxychloroquine 
include agranulocytosis45 and aplastic anemia, but there has never been a report of this occurring 
with hydroxychloroquine in doses less than 7 mg/kg/day or during short -term use.  
Minor pote ntial risks of receiving hydroxychloroquine include: retinopathy or corneal deposits (with 
months -to-years of therapy); vertigo, tinnitus, or deafness; headache; light -headedness; insomnia; tremor 
or dyskinesia; peripheral neuropathy (with months -to-years of therapy); nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; 
mild dermatologic reaction; and muscle weakness (with months -to-years of therapy).  
9.1.[ADDRESS_872743] be enrolled to determine whether hydroxychloroquine is an effective therapy for COVID -19, 
excluding patients who decline to participate because they feel the ir optimal care requires 
hydroxychloroquine, excluding patients whose treating clinicians declines to allow enrollment because 
they feel the patient’s optimal care requires treatment with hydroxychloroquine, and specifying 
procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_49080], unblinding, and allowing open- label administration of 
hydroxychloroquine for patients who experience clinical deterioration during the study period.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_872744] once the patches are 
removed, without requiring treatment.  
9.2 Minimization of Risk  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46.111(a)(1) require that risks to participants are minimized by [CONTACT_191693].  This trial protocol incorporat es numerous 
design elements to minimize risk to patients that meet this human subject protection requirement.  
Hydroxychloroquine has been approved by [CONTACT_650788] a number of patien t populations with an established safety profile.  The 
dose and route of administration of hydroxychloroquine in this trial are comparable to the dose and route 
of administration approved for the treatment of other acute infections, such as malaria.  The duration of 
treatment in this trial of [ADDRESS_872745] benefits from their participation in this study. 
Administration of hydroxychloroquine may improve clinical outcomes among adults hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190290] -19 infection.  
9.4 Risk in Relation to Anticipated Benefit  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46.111 (a)(2) require that “the risks to subjects are reasonable i n relation to 
anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be 
expected to result.” Based on the preceding assessment of risks and potential benefits, the risks to subjects 
are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.  Hydroxychloroquine has been used in clinical practice 
for decades and previously evaluated for the treatment of patients acutely ill from infection with 
substantial data to support its safety and potential efficacy.  
 
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  
Each study participant or a LAR must sign and date an informed consent form. Approval of t he central 
institutional review board will be required before any participant  is entered into the study.  
10.1 Selection of Subjects  
Federal regulation s at 45 CFR 46(a)(3) require the equitable selection of subjects. The emergency 
departments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_173967], and ICUs of participating sites will be screened to determine if any patient 
meets inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data that have been collected as part of the routine clinical care of  
the patient  will be reviewed to determine eligibility. If any patient meets criteria for study enrollment, 
then the attending physician responsible for his or her care will be asked for permission to approach the 
patient or his  or her LAR for informed consent. Study exclusion criteria neither unjustly exclude classes 
of individuals from participation in the research nor unjustly include classes of individuals for  
participation in the research. Hence, the recruitment of participants conforms to the principle of 
distrib utive justice.  
10.[ADDRESS_872746] milder disease than those with 
impaired capacity. Therefore, the va lidity of the study and its generalizability to severely ill patients 
would be compromised by [CONTACT_650789]- making capacity. 
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 33 of 53  Hence, participants recruited for this trial are not being unfairly burdened with involvement in this 
research . 
10.3 Informed Consent  
Federal regulations 45 CFR 46.111(a)(5) require that informed consent will be sought from each patient 
or the patient’s  LAR. Study personnel obtaining informed consent are responsible for ensuring that the 
patient or LAR understands the risks and benefits of participating in the study, answering any questions 
the patient  or LAR may have throughout the study and sharing any new information in a timely manner 
that may be relevant to the patient ’s or LAR’s willingn ess to permit the patient ’s continued participation 
in the trial. The study personnel obtaining informed consent will make every effort to minimize coercion. 
All patients  or their LARs will be informed of the objectives of the study and the potential risks. The 
informed consent document will be used to explain the risks and benefits of study participation to the 
patient  or LAR in simple terms before the patient is entered into the study, and to confirm  that the patient  
or LAR is satisfied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in the study and 
desires to participate in the study. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is 
given by [CONTACT_650790]. This includes obtaining the appropriate signatu res and dates on the 
informed consent document prior to the performance of any protocol procedures including administration 
of study agent.  
For additional details, see Section [ADDRESS_872747] that such consent 
shoul d be obtained.  The process for obtaining consent from  these patients will be the same as that 
outlined in section 3.  
10.5 Withdrawal of Consent  
Participat ing patients  may withdraw or be withdrawn (by [CONTACT_55639] , treating physician, or investigator ) 
from the trial at any time without prejudice. Data recorded up to the point of withdrawal will be included 
in the trial analysis, unless consent to use data has also been withdrawn. Withdrawal of consent prior to 
receipt of study drug will constitute a screen- failure and will be recorded.  Withdrawal of consent after 
randomization and administration of one or more doses of study drug will lead to discontinuation  of study 
interventions  but site staff will request access to medical records for data related to the trial .   
10.[ADDRESS_872748] impaired  decision -
making  capacity  due to critical illness and will not be able to provide informed consent. Accordingly, 
informed consent will be sought from the patient’s  LAR.   
Regarding consent  from the LAR , the existing federal research regulations (‘the Common Rule’) states at 
45 CFR 46.116 that “no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research…unless the 
investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or t he subject’s legally 
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 34 of 53  authorized representative”; and defines at 45 CFR 46 102 (c) a LAR as “an individual or judicial or other 
body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject’s 
participation in the procedur es(s) involved in the research.” The Office of Human Research Protections 
(OHRP) defined examples of “applicable law” as being state statutes, regulations, case law, or formal 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a State Attorney General that addresses the issue of surrogate consen t to medical procedures. 
Such “applicable law” could then be considered as empowering the LAR to provide consent for 
participant participation in the research. Interpretation of “applicable law” may be state specific and will 
be addressed by [CONTACT_650791] B.  
According to a previous President’s Bioethics Committee (National Bioethics Advisory Committee 
(NBAC)), an investigator should accept a relative or friend of the potential participant who is recognized 
as an LAR for purposes of clinical decision making  under the law of the state where the research takes 
place.46 Finally, OHRP has stated in their determination letters that a surrogate could serve as a LAR for 
research decision making if such an individual is authorized under applicable state law to provide consent 
for the “procedures” involved in the research study  
10.[ADDRESS_872749] two ethical convictions; first, 
that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that persons  with diminished 
autonomy a re entitled to protection. One method that serves to protect patients  is restrictions on the 
participation of patients  in research that presents greater than minimal risk. Commentators and research 
ethics commissions have held the view that it is permissib le to include incapable participants in greater 
than minimal risk research as long as there is the potential for beneficial effects and that the research 
presents a balance of risks and expected direct benefits similar to that available in the clinical set ting.[ADDRESS_872750] deemed it permissible to include incapable participants in research. For 
example, the American College of Physicians’ document allows surrogates to consent to research 
involvi ng incapable participants only “if the net additional risks of participation are not substantially 
greater than the risks of standard treatment”.[ADDRESS_872751] medical benefits to the participant, 
provided that “the potential subject’s LAR gives permission…”.[ADDRESS_872752] benefits that is similar to that available in the 
clinical setting.  
10.8 Additional Safeguards for Vulnerable Participants  
The present research will involve participants who might be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. As 
required in 45CFR46.111(b), we recommend that sites utilize additional safeguards to protect the rights 
and welfare of these participant s. Such safeguards might include but are not limited to: a) assessment of 
the potential participant’s capacity to provide informed consent, and b) the availability of the LAR to 
monitor the participant’s  subsequent participation and withdrawal from the study. The specific nature of 
the additional safeguards will be left to the discretion of the central IRB, in conjunction with the sites.  
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 35 of 53  10.9 Confidentiality 
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46 111 (a) (7) re quires that when appropriate, there are adequate provisions 
to protect the privacy of participants and to maintain the confidentiality of data. At no time during the 
course of this study, its analysis, or its publication will patient identities be revealed in any manner.  The 
minimum necessary data containing patient or provider identities will be collected.  All patients will be 
assigned a unique study ID number for tracking.  All data collected for this study will be entered directly 
into a secure online database.  All data will be maintained in the secure online database until the time of 
study publication.  At the time of publication, a de -identified version of the database will be generated. 
Further, tools within the secure online database will be used so that only the coordinating center and 
investigators from the enrolling site will have access to data from participants enrolled at that site.  
 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Assuring patient safety is an essential component of this protocol.  Hydroxychloroquine ha s been 
approved by [CONTACT_650792].  Use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_650756]- 19, however, raises unique safety con siderations.  This protocol addresses these considerations 
through:  
1. Exclusion criteria designed to prevent enrollment of patients likely to experience adverse events with 
receipt of hydroxychloroquine ; 
2. Proactive education of treating clinicians regarding m edication interactions relevant to use of 
hydroxychloroquine in the inpatient setting ; 
3. On-study monitoring of co- interventions (e.g., medications) and patient characteristics (e.g., EKG) to 
intervene before adverse events occur ; 
4. Systematic collection of safety outcomes relevant to use of hydroxychloroquine in this setting ; 
5. Structured reporting of adverse events  
11.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug or a study 
procedure, whether or not  considered drug related.  
Serious Adverse Event : A serious adverse event is any adverse event that results in one of the outcomes 
listed in section 11.3 below.  
Adverse Reaction : An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a study intervention. A n 
adverse reaction is a subset of all suspected adverse events  where there is a reason to conclude that the 
study intervention caused the event.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction : Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study procedures caused the adverse event. Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a 
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 36 of 53  causal relationship between the study procedures and the adverse event. A suspec ted adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction.  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) : An adverse reaction that is both 
unexpected (not consistent with risks outlined in the study protocol o r investigator brochure), serious, and 
meets the definition of a suspected adverse reaction.  
11.2 Safety Monitoring  
Assuring patient safety is an essential component of this protocol. Each participating investigator has 
primary responsibility for the safety of the individual participants under his or her care. The Investigators 
will determine daily if any adverse events occur during the period from enrollment through study day 7 
(48 hours after completion of the study drug) or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], whichever occurs first and will 
determine if such adverse events are reportable.  Thereafter, adverse events are not required to be reported 
unless the investigator feels the adverse event was related to study drug or study procedures.   
The following adverse events will be considered reportable and thus collected in the adverse event case 
report forms:   
 Serious adverse events  
 Non-serious adverse events that are considered by [CONTACT_563166] (Appendix C)  
 Events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug  
Study- specific clinical outcomes (Primary , Secondary and Safety  Outcomes and Assessments 
During the Study), including serious outcomes  such as organ failures and death, are 
systematically recorded in the case report forms and are exempt from adverse event reporting 
unless the investigator deems the event to be r elated to the administration of study drug or the 
conduct of study procedures (or of uncertain relationship) as outlined in Appendix C.  
After randomization, adverse events must be evaluated by [CONTACT_093]. If the adverse event is judged 
to be reporta ble, as outlined above, then the investigator will report to the CCC their assessment of the 
potential relatedness of each adverse event to the study drug or protocol procedure via electronic data 
entry. Investigators will assess if there is a reasonable p ossibility that the study procedure caused the 
event, based on the criteria outlined in Appendix C. Investigators will also consider if the event is 
unexpected.  Unexpected adverse events are events not listed in the study protocol and the investigator 
brochure for Hydroxychloroquine. Investigators will also determine if adverse events are unanticipated 
given the patient’s clinical course, previous medical conditions, and concomitant medications.   
If a patient's treatment is discontinued as a result of an adverse event, study site personnel must also 
report the circumstances and data leading to discontinuation of treatment in the adverse event case report 
forms.   
11.[ADDRESS_872753] alert the CCC of any serious and 
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 37 of 53  study procedure related  adverse event within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event.  Alerts 
issued via telephone are to be immediately followed with official notification on the adverse event case 
report form. See Appendix C for reporting timelines for  serious, unexpected, study related events (SAEs) 
and serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
As per the FDA and NIH definitions, a serious adverse event is any adverse event that results in one of 
the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
 Prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257353] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_562979]://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053087.htm : Report if admission 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274358] a result of the adverse event. Emergency roo m 
visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563135] (e.g., life -threatening; required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; 
other serious medically important event).  
 Persisten t or significant disability/incapacity  
As per http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053087.htm : Report if the adverse 
event resulted in a substantial disruption of a p erson's ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., 
the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or 
disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life.  
Repo rtable serious adverse events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312753], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Serious adverse events will be collected during the first  [ADDRESS_872754], regardless of the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289] .  
 
12. Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  
The principal role of the DSMB is to assure the safety of participants in the trial. They will regularly 
monitor data from this trial, review and assess the performance of its operations, and make 
recommendations to the steering committee and NHLBI  with re spect to:  
• Review of adverse events  
• Interim results of the study for evidence of efficacy or adverse events  
• Possible early termination of the trial because of new external information, early attainment of 
study objectives, safety concerns, or inadequate pe rformance  
• Possible modifications in the clinical trial protocol  
• Performance of individual centers  
The NHLBI PETAL Network DSMB is appointed by [CONTACT_650793]. The DSMB reviews all protocols for safety following review by [CONTACT_650794] 4.[ADDRESS_872755] or. 
Recommendations for major changes, such as stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526746] , will be reviewed by [CONTACT_650795]. Other recommendations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_650796], which will distribute to the PETAL steering committee with 
instructions for reporting to local IRBs when appropriate.

ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 45 of 53  Appendix C:  Adverse Event Reporting and Unanticipated Events  
As noted in section 11, investigators will report all “serious adverse events,”  defined as adverse events 
that are serious and have a reasonable possibility that the event was due to a study drug or procedure (or 
of uncertain relatedness) , to the CCC within [ADDRESS_872759] (cIRB).  
The Medical Monitor at the CCC will work collaboratively with the reporting investigator to determine if 
a serious adverse event has a reasonable possibility of having been caused by [CONTACT_650799], as outlined in 21 CFR 312.32(a) (1), and below. The Medical Monitor will be unblinded and 
will also determine if the event is unexpected for hydroxychloroquine.  An adverse is considered 
“unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or the study protocol (21 CFR 312.32(a)). If a 
determination is made that a serious adverse event has a reasonable possibility of having been caused by a 
study procedure or the study drug, it will be classified as a suspected adverse reaction. If the suspected 
adverse reaction is unexpe cted, it will be classified as a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R).  
The CCC will report all unexpected deaths, serious and treatment related adverse events, and S[LOCATION_003]Rs to 
the DSMB, NHLBI, and cIRB within 7 days after receipt of the report from a clinical site. A written 
report will be sent to the NHLBI, DSMB, FDA, and the cIRB within 15 calendar days. The DSMB will 
also review all reported adverse events and clinical outcomes during scheduled interim analyses. The 
CCC will distribute th e written summary of the DSMB’s periodic review of reported adverse events to the 
cIRB in accordance with NIH guidelines (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/not99 -107.html). 
The Medical Monitor will provide to Sandoz Pharmacovigilance any sign ificant safety findings  (without 
disclosing protected health information)  during the conduct of the trial.  
 
C.1. Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
Investigators must also report Unanticipated Problems, regardless of severity, associated with study 
procedures wi thin 24 hours. An unanticipated problem is defined as follows: any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given the research procedures that are 
described in the p rotocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research, in this guidance document, possibly 
related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459];  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including p hysical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
C.2. Determining Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug or Study Procedures  
Investigators will be asked to grade the strength of the relationship of an adver se event to study drug or 
study procedures as follows:  
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 46 of 53  • Definitely Related: The event follows: a) A reasonable, temporal sequence from a study 
procedure; and b) Cannot be explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state 
or other thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and c) Evaluation of the patient’s clinical state indicates to the investigator that 
the experience is definitely related to study procedures.  
• Probably or Possibly Related: The event should be assessed following the same criteria for 
“Definitely Associated”. If in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_563136], then “probably” or “possibly” associated should be selected.  
• Probably Not Related: The event occurred while the patient was on the study but can reasonably 
be explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Definitely Not Related: The event is definitely produced by [CONTACT_42036]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_563171].  
• Uncertain Relationship: The event does not meet any of the criteria previously outlined.  
C.3. Clinical Outcomes that may be Exempt from Adverse Event Reporting  
Study- specifi c outcomes of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], COVID -19, and critical illness will be 
systematically collected for all patients in both study group and are exempt from adverse event 
reporting unless the investigator considers the event to be Definitely or Poss ibly Related  (or of an 
Uncertain Relationship) to the study drug or study procedures.  Examples of study- specific clinical 
outcomes include:  
• Death not related to the study procedures  
• Neurological events  
o Seizure  
• Cardiovascular events  
o Receipt of vasopressor s 
o Atrial or ventricular arrhythmia  
o Cardiac arrest  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]  
o Hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen  
o Acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]  
o Receipt of mechanical ventilation  
o Receipt of extra- corporeal membrane oxygenation  
• Gastrointestinal events  
o Eleva tion of aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase  
o Acute pancreatitis  
• Renal events  
o Acute kidney injury 
o Receipt of renal replacement therapy  
• Endocrine events  
o Symptomatic hypoglycemia  
• Hematologic or coagulation events  
o Neutropenia, lymphopenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia  
• Dermatologic events  
o Severe dermatologic reaction (e.g., Steven’s Johnson Syndrome)  
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 47 of 53  Note: A study -specific clinical outcome may also qualify as a reportable adverse event.  For example, a 
ventricular arrhythmia that the investigator considers Definitely or Possibly Related  to the study drug 
would be both recorded as a study- specific clinical outcome and reported as a Serious and Definitely or 
Possibly Related Adverse Event.

ORCHID Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_872760]  
This study is being conducted to determine whether hydroxychloroquine can safely and effectively be 
used to mitigate, treat, or cure COVID -19 or limit the  harm of the COVID -19 pandemic in accordance 
with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS’s) Declaration under the 
Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID -19 
(COVID- 19 Declaration )  effective February 4, 2020.  The purpose of this study is to test if 
hydroxychloroquine results in clinical benefit in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] - 19.   
Hydroxychloroquine has been approved by [CONTACT_650800]-
19 in this study has been exempted by [CONTACT_650801] 21 CFR 312.2(b)(1).  This study is conducted under a Research Project Cooperative 
Agreement with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Ins titute .

Appendix E: ORCHID -BUD Ancillary Study Protocol  
1. Title:  Outcomes R elated to COVID -19 treated with Hydroxychloroquine among In -patients with 
symptomatic Disease – Brain O utcomes and Psychological D istress ( ORCHID -BUD ) 
2. Objective : 
• Aim 1 : To determine (a) the epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (i.e., prevalence) of cognitive impairment (i.e., 
acquired -Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia [ADRD]) characterized by [CONTACT_650802], attention, language, reasoning, and executive function at 12- months in adults  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 infection, and (b) if hydroxychloroquine administration is 
associated with improvement in these same outcomes.  
• Aim 2 : To determine (a) the epi[INVESTIGATOR_650762] -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 
depression at 12- months in adul ts who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 infection, and (b) if 
hydroxychloroquine administration is associated with improvement in these same outcomes.  
• Aim 3 : To identify modifiable risk factors (e.g., sedatives, isolation, intravenous fluids, 
antibiotics, p ressor, angiotensin- converting enzyme [ACE] -inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor 
blocker [ARB] use, etc.) associated with worse long- term cognitive impairment, PTSD, and 
depression at 12 months in adults hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 infection.  
3. Hypothesis:  The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) COVID -[ADDRESS_872761], PTSD, and depression. The secondary hypothesis is that hydroxychloroquine will 
lower the burden of these three outcomes as compared to placebo.  
4. Study Des ign: ORCHID- BUD will assess 12 -month cognition, PTSD, and depression using a 
comprehensive phone battery in all patients enrolled in ORCHID since the beginning of the study 
(March 2020).  ORCHID -BUD essentially expands and better defines the ORCHID’s follo w-up study 
procedures that are already described its study protocol (ORCHID protocol Version 1.1, Section 
6.3.2, and page 22):“We will follow -up selected patients at 3, 6, and 12 months to assess vital status, 
cognition, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, quality of life, employment status, physical 
disability, and psychological distress (i.e., depression, post -traumatic stress disorder, etc.), place of 
residence, and rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. These assessments may occur by [CONTACT_648], in- person, or 
videoconferencing.”   In anticipation of ORCHID -BUD, the ORCHID parent study has already added 
language to the informed consent document to conduct the proposed study procedures, including the 
baseline phone interview with the patient and family member:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0 
June 4, 2020   Page 50 of 53  Therefore, the ORCHID -BUD study activities will be considered part of the ORCHID parent study 
activities, and separate informed consent will not be performed.   
5. Study procedures :  
5.[ADDRESS_872762] th e surrogate approximately 3- months (+/ - 2 months) 
after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650763], PTSD, and depression. We 
will contact [CONTACT_650803] (phone, 
text message, or e- mail).   
For the family member, we will administer the short form Informant Questionnaire on 
Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) establish the subject’s baseline cognition; this 
16-item questionnaire takes less than [ADDRESS_872763] the FAM -CAM  and SQiD , which are informant -based delirium assessment s, to 
further characterize delirium  during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. We will ask th em to estimate the number 
of days they felt the patient was confused.  We will also ask if they (or any family members) 
were able to visit the patient in person, by [CONTACT_648], or by [CONTACT_650804]. We will also ask them 
to estimate the number of days the subjec t was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650764], duration of 
ICU length of stay and mechanical ventilation.  We will also ask if the surrogate whether or 
not the subject has baseline dementia, PTSD, or depression. We will also ask about the 
subject’s race, ethnicity, age, level of education, highest occupation, and region of residence.  
These data will be obtained over the phone, but the family member will have the option to 
complete the surveys via an online REDCap survey if preferred.   
If no surrogate is listed  for ORCHID, we will contact [CONTACT_650805] (phone, text message, or e -mail).  If the surrogate is available, we obtain the 
surrogate’s contact [CONTACT_3031].   For the patient, w e will administer the IQCODE and ask if 
they have baseline dementia, PTSD, or depression.  We will also ask if they were on 
cholinesterase inhibitors before they were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191544] -19. We will also ask their 
race, ethnicity, age, level of educatio n, highest occupation, and region of residence.  We will 
ask patients some questions about their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  We will also ask how long they were 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], how long were they in the ICU, and how long they were mechanically 
ventilated. These questi ons may be answered by [CONTACT_650806]. We will also ask patients if they felt confused, disoriented, or had hallucinations 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. We will ask them to estimate the number of days during the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650765] y felt they had these symptoms. We will also ask how much contact [CONTACT_650807][INVESTIGATOR_650766], by 
[CONTACT_514405], or by [CONTACT_648].  We will also ask about the subject’s race, ethnicity, age, 
level of education, highest occupation, and region of residence. These data will be obtained 
over the phone, but the subject will have the option to complete the surveys via an online 
REDCap survey if preferred.   
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.[ADDRESS_872764] them 
approximately 12- months (+/ - 3 months) after randomization to assess their cognition and 
psychological well -being using a phone battery. We will also let them know that we will give 
them a gift card after they  complete the [ADDRESS_872765] enroll subjects at approximately 12- months (+/ - 3 months) .  We 
will perform the phone battery as described in the Primary Endpoints (Section 10) and Seconda ry 
Endpoints (Section 11) section.  Any data not obtained during the baseline phone call will be 
obtained during the 12- month phone call to minimize missing data.  After the 12- month follow -up is 
completed, patients will be given a gift card.  
It is possibl e that ORCHID- BUD patients will be co -enrolled with other PETAL network COVID -19 
trials (e.g., BLUE CORAL) who are conducting long- term follow -ups. We may coordinate with the 
University of Washington and University of Michigan study teams to streamline dat a collection and 
minimize overburdening the patient.  
5.[ADDRESS_872766] the 12- month 
outcomes.   
6. Risks:  Because ORCHID -BUD is only adding a comprehensive phone battery at 12- months, its risks 
are minimal:  
6.1 Fatigue or distress:  For ORCHID -BUD specifically, subjects will undergo a comprehensive phone 
battery at 12 -months that can take up to 45 to 60 minutes to perform. There is a small risk that the 
patient may become fatigued or distressed during the study’s cognitive assessment s. 
6.2 Confidentiality:  Because patient identifiers are accessed throughout all phases of the study, there is a 
small risk of loss of patient confidentiality.  
7. Inclusion Criteria : : All patients enrolled in ORCHID will be included.  
8. Exclusion Criteria : ORCHID -BUD will exclude patients who are:  
(1) non- English or non- Spanish speaking,  
(2) deaf, or  
(3) non- verbal or unable to follow simple commands prior to the COVID -19 illness.   
We will exclude non- English and Non- Spanish speaking patients because our  neuropsychological 
raters can only provide their assessments in these languages.  We will also exclude patients who are 
non-verbal or unable to follow simple commands prior to the COVID -19 illness to exclude patients 
with end- stage dementia.  
ORCHID Protocol Version 4.0

surrogates approximately one to three months after ORCHID randomization.  At approximately 12 -
months (+/ - 3 months) after randomization, we will call the patients and conduct the phone battery to

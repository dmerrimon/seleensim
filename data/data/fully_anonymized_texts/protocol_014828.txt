 Research Design and Methods:  
Describe in detail the design and methodology of the  study.  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
The overall purpose of the RCTs is to evaluate the impact that R/R, delivered through the patient portal, could  
have on the flu immunization rates of UCLA Health patients. The intent is to ultimately take the information  
learned and create and disseminate an adaptable toolkit to other health systems.  
 
Specific aims are  
 
Aim #1: Adapt algorithms, educational messages, and  protocols previously used for mailed or phone influenza  
vaccine R/R, to create a patient portal research platform. (Aim 1 is outlined in detail in IRB applications titled:  
Patient Portal - Patient Qualitative Interviews and Patient - Portal Provider Qualit ative Interview)  
 
Aim #2: Assess the impact of portal R/R and key design features upon flu vaccination rates and costs.  
2a: Using a [ADDRESS_13937], clustering within practices (up to 55), compare the effectiveness of 1, 2, or 3  
portal R/R’s vs. 0 R/R’s on influ enza vaccination rates  
Hyp. 2a.1 [Primary Outcome]: >1 portal R/R will increase vaccination rates vs. no R/R.  
Hyp. 2a.2: More R/R messages will raise vaccination rates (3R/R > 2R/R > 1R/R > 0R/R).  
 
 
OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  
Subjects receiving the intervention will be patients at one of the primary care practices within UCLA Health’s  
System (up to 55 practices), and will include patients of any age. A proportion of the patients from these  
practices will be selected to participate - i.e. those who meet the inclus ion criteria. Randomization techniques 
will occur before each RCT.  
 
Patient s will either be randomized to receive 0 (control), 1, 2 or 3 flu reminder messages via the portal.  
 
Number of Subjects  
There are approx n = 385,000 patients in the primary care reg istry (RCT#1) who are active/inactive portal 
users  and affiliated with the primary care practices of interest for this research, and will be randomized into 
either the  control, 1, 2, or 3 reminder arms (for RCT #1).  
 
Many patients are members of the same f amily. As such, the research team will assemble family units (using  
household address, primary telephone number, patient ID of the guarantor, and insurance member ID as the  
variables of commonality to create these family units). For RCT 1, for each family,  1 individual will be randomly  
selected as the index patient. Only index patients who are also active portal users and affiliated with a primary  
care practice (criteria explained below) will have their data analyzed as part of the primary analysis plan.  
Secondary analyses will involve all study subjects.  
 
Gender and age: We anticipate the gender distribution to be roughly equal. All ages of patients will be included 
in the study; however, patient will not receive a message until they are 6 months of age, as  the flu vaccine is 
not recommended for those less than 6 months of age.  
 
Racial and ethnic origin: There are no enrollment restrictions based on race/ethnicity.  
Inclusion criteria  
 
 
A patient at one of the clinics of interest within the UCLA Health System  (up to 55 practices). An individual is  
deemed a primary care patient of the UCLA Health System through the following algorithm:  
 
Assigned managed care patients (UCLAMG) +  Attributed patients from other payers/ACOs  
􀀀 ≥[ADDRESS_13938] 3 years; or  
3 
 􀀀 ≥[ADDRESS_13939] 1 year ([ZIP_CODE] -[ZIP_CODE] or G0438/G0439)  
􀀀 All visits cannot be urgent care visits (ie excludes visits after hours or on weekends, not by [CONTACT_14568])  
 
Active pa tient: We decided to use the algorithm outlined above and currently approved and in place by [CONTACT_14569] a generalizable model that could be applied to 
other health  systems.  
 
Exclusion criteria  
Patients will be excluded from the overall study if they are not part of UCLA's primary care registry per the 
above  algorithm detailed in the inclusion criteria.  
 
Creating family units  
An overall address field will be constructed from the data pull including the address , city, state, and zip code  
fields. Primary telephone number, patient ID of the guarantor and insurance member ID will be used as other  
variables in the process to create the family units. The following steps taken to create these family units is 
described  below:  
1. Start with a single entry in the contact [CONTACT_14570]  
2. Add any other entries with the same patient ID as any existing entry to the family  
3. Add any other entries with the same address as any existing entry to the family  
4. Add any other entries with the sam e primary phone as any existing entry to the family  
5. Add any other entries with a patient ID matching the patient ID of guarantor as any existing entry to 
the family  
6. Add any other entries with the same insurance member ID as any existing entry to the family  
7. Repeat steps [ADDRESS_13940] been 
associated with a family.  
Please note - when there were errors with the address and telephone number, these variables were not used 
to group families (ex. instances with 20+ entries with the same data for telephone number).  
 
Definition of active portal user:  
We can only send portal R/R messages to patients who have signed up f or the portal. Since some patients 
sign up for the portal but never use it, we define an active portal user as a patient (or proxy on behalf of the 
patient)  who has used the portal within 12m (~59% of UCLA patients), and who has logged in [ADDRESS_13941]  12 months (reference date for login activity will be selected by [CONTACT_14571]  365 days, example of a range 8/1/17 - 7/31/[ADDRESS_13942] excluding their initial activation login 
and any  subsequent logins on the s ame date of account activation.  
 
Selection of index patient from each family unit  
1. If the family contains any active portal user per our definition above, the index patient is randomly selected  
from among these patients.  
2. If the family contains no active por tal users, the index patient is randomly selected from all patients in the  
family.  
 
 
Selection of the index patient for primary analysis:  
1. An active portal user per the definition above  
2. The patient is affiliated with one of the primary care clinics of  interest  
3. The patient was randomly selected as the index patient in their family unit  
 
We will assess primary intervention effects among eligible index patients, and secondary analyses for the 
entire  primary care registry since the impact of the interve ntion reflects the extent of portal penetration and high  
4 
 correlation that exists among members of the same family (n=385,[ADDRESS_13943]; up to 480,[ADDRESS_13944],(ISS -generated data extraction: of 430,000; IP -generated data extraction of a pproximately 
50,000  (MRNS only)  
. 
 
METHODS AND STUDY PROCEDURES  
The UCLA Health System is made up in part of approx 55 primary care practices. The leadership team at 
UCLA  Health has agreed to allow these practices to participate in the 4 RCTs outlined below.  
Among the primary care practices (up to n= 55), patients who meet the inclusion criteria (outlined above and in  
section 11.1 item 4.0) will be randomized into the study arms. Below is a detailed outline of each of the four 
RCTs  and the interventiona l components.  
 
RCT - conducted 2018 -19 
We propose a randomized trial, where patients are randomized within practices to 0, 1, 2 or 3 R/R messages  
sent via the portal on a 1:1:1:1 basis. Our prior studies showed the effects of influenza R/R can vary by [CONTACT_14572] (i.e. age, race, practice type). We will select [ADDRESS_13945] each other’s receipt of vaccine.  
Inclusion criteria: Outlined above.  
 
Eligib ility for R/R: Our EHR will identify subjects who are eligible for either 1 or 2 influenza vaccinations based 
on ACIP algorithms (2 are recommended for children <[ADDRESS_13946] not had a prior flu vaccination).  
Spacing of R/R messages: Based on our prior  studies, we plan to send up to 3 R/R messages, spaced every 
3-4 weeks, beginning in October; Aim 1 findings may modify plans.  
 
Languages: R/R messages will be in English. Portal messages in Spanish will not be available during RCT 1 
due to technological c apabilities.  
 
Health Literacy: We will use plain language <8th grade reading level per Flesch -Kincaid analysis.  
In Aim 1 we will adapt messages with input from key stakeholders (see IRB submissions titled: Patient Portal - 
Patient Qualitative Interviews an d Patient - Portal Provider Qualitative Interview for full outline of protocol). Our  
message content will be rooted in decades of work by [CONTACT_14573] (see file named: Health Belief Model for multipl e examples of the content that will be 
adapted for  the message). The content of the R/R message will be the same for each reminder that is sent.  
Please see item 1.[ADDRESS_13947]  
Reminders  is the language used in the first two reminders (sent in October and November 2018), and the file 
titled RCT #[ADDRESS_13948].  
 
Website link: the research team is  working with UCLA marketing department to develop a new flu educational  
webpage. This webpage is currently under -development, but we will embed short health educational videos  
(examples below) on the UCLA website specific for this project:  
https://www.you tube.com/watch?v=EstDvA -mr5A  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTjchoH1KYM  
 
The purpose of this website is to determine what subject areas of vaccine education (i.e. safety, effectiveness,  
general info) that patients are most interested in. All content will be approved by [CONTACT_14574]'s marketing dept.  
 
R/R Message Content: The content of each R/R message will be the same for each study arm. As discussed  
above we may modify the R/R message content slightly based the results of the prior RCTs and the qualitative  
interviews to follow. The number of R/R’s sent will be based upon the optimal number from Aim 1 and will be  
identical for both study arms.  
 
Please see item 1.0 for examples of the messages to be used (title: RCT #3 Reminders). Example message 
for Arm [ADDRESS_13949].  
5 
  
Toolkit Development (Aim 3)  
Toolkit and Adoption Guide: In the final year we will develop an online toolkit and adoption guide for portal -
based  R/R, with a manual of operations for algorithms, messages, data management protocols and c osts for 
start-up and maintenance. Guides will contain FAQs and common scenarios, references, websites, and other 
materials  for health systems to personalize portal R/R. We will use diffusion of innovation methods guided by 
[CONTACT_14575]. The  toolkit and guide will be adaptable for pandemic flu vaccination R/R.  
Please note, should the language included in any of the messages outlines for RCT [ADDRESS_13950], qualitative provider and p atient interviews will be conducted. Those procedures and measures  
are outlined in IRB submissions titled: Patient Portal - Patient Qualitative Interviews and Patient - Portal  
 
Provider  Qualitative Interview.  
Independent Variables: The key variable is study group (portal R/R vs control).  
Treatment Variables: Exposure to: (a) any portal R/R messages or (b) 1, 2 or 3 R/R’s; see Analysis for RCT 1.  
Covariates: Covariates considered for analyses (found in studies to affect flu vaccine rates) include: Practi ce 
variables will include type - (ex. pediatric, internal medicine, geriatric, or Med -Peds, and family medicine).  
Patient variables will include - age (6m -17y, 18 -64y, 65+y), race/ethnicity, gender, primary language (by [CONTACT_14576]),  
degree of portal use, and receipt of influenza vaccination in prior years. We recognize few UCLA patients have  
Medicaid; we will focus on low -income groups in the dissemination phase (Aim 3).  
 
Dependent Measures  
Vaccine Outcome: The primary outcome is influenza vaccination during t he vaccination season as measured 
by [CONTACT_14577]. For children <9y who had not received prior influenza vaccination, the outcome will 
be at  least 1 influenza vaccination.  
 
Process Outcomes: These will include: (a) total # visits to the practice du ring the study time period, (b) # flu  
vaccine  or nurse visits, and (c) missed opportunities. Visits will be measured by [CONTACT_14578]; using ICD -10/CPT  
codes to classify visits to primary care as preventive, acute/chronic, or nurse -vaccination. Missed opportunit ies 
are defined as # vaccine -eligible visits during which the patient did not receive an influenza vaccination. These  
process metrics will help assess how the intervention worked.  
 
Additional Measures: see file: Summary of outcome measures RCT 1 which show s additional measures,  
grounded in the RE -AIM framework. Found in item 1.0 of this section.  
 
Costs: Since the intervention is implemented centrally we assume no added practice costs. We also assume  
practice costs/vaccination from portal R/R is identical to  standard practice costs/vaccination. We will assess 
the time and costs of study and implementation personnel and non -personnel costs, distinguishing planning 
costs  from intervention costs. We will measure costs using a standardized time study/resource sur vey sent 
weekly to  all individuals working on the study that delineates (a) the # hours spent for each individual, and (b) 
research vs  implementation time. We will use national salary estimates by [CONTACT_14579]. We will measure non -personnel costs EHR hardware, 
software,  materials.  
 
 
Cost and Cost Effectiveness  
Costs: We will assume that the actual per -dose vaccination costs (administration costs, vaccine costs, storage,  
etc.) are ide ntical for intervention and comparison patients and equal to the average national reimbursement 
for an influenza vaccine dose. The difference in total costs between the study arms will be influenced by [CONTACT_14580], the difference in vaccination rates within study arms, and the 
subsequent  health care utilization by [CONTACT_14581] (which we can model from prior studies)  
 
6 
 Effectiveness: For each RCT we will estimate effectiveness using model -based, standardized expected val ues 
(mean) at the end of each RCT. We will calculate incremental cost -effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each  
intervention arm.  
 
For example, to compare costs in RCT #1 for Arm 3 R/R’s vs Arm 2 R/R’s, the ICER is: ICER (Arms 3 R/R vs 2  
R/R) = (costArm  3 R/R – costArm 2 R/R) / (Flu vaccine rateArm 3 R/R – Flu vaccine rateArm 2 R/R)  
In the numerator of the above equation, the costArm X is equal to [(# Flu vaccine doses given per study arm x  
average national vaccine reimbursement per dose) + average costs  per patient in that Arm]. The denominator 
of the equation is the difference in model -based, standardized expected values at the end of the intervention.  
 
 
STATISTICS AND ANALYTIC PLAN  
Analytic Plan :  
The primary outcome is receipt of influenza vaccine amo ng eligible index patients comparing the  
effectiveness of 1, 2, or 3 MyChart flu reminders to zero MyChart flu reminders.  
Secondary measures are receipt of influenza vaccine among all identified patients in the primary care registry  
(per the algorithm outl ined above in the inclusion criteria), process metrics, # subsequent preventive visits, and  
costs.  
 
Power Analysis :  
Power was evaluated using a simulation study. We assumed a within -practice randomization  
plan, and expect at minimum the sample sizes repor ted in Table 3 (n=145,684). We further assumed, based 
on preliminary UCLA Health data, that influenza vaccination rates are 42% among portal users without receipt 
of any portal -based R/R, and 45%, 47% and 49% among users in the 1, 2, and 3 R/R arms. We est imate 1,248  
portal user families per practice (we will select [ADDRESS_13951] per family), based on our estimated mean family size 
of 2.38 portal users per family, and up to 55 practices.  
 
Adjusting for clustering of patients in practices, and assuming an intrac lass correlation (ICC) of 1% (consistent  
with previous work), this sample size provides >90% power to detect an overall difference of 5 percentage 
points  between portal -based R/R (combining 1, 2, + 3 R/R arms) and 0 R/R arm for all users and subgroups of 
interest  (age and race/ethnicity). The power for the subgroups corresponds to evaluating the treatment effect 
within each  subgroup. These power analyses represent conservative estimates based on the available patient 
sample —we expect larger effect sizes bas ed upon our prior R/R studies. An estimated number of index 
subjects is 1,248 x 55 = 68,640.  
 
Statistical Analysis - Primary Outcome  
Hyp. 2a .1: Patients receiving 1, 2, or 3 portal R/R will have higher influenza vaccination rates than 0 R/R.  
Primary outcomes (patient receipt of flu vaccine) are binary; our main explanatory variable will be an indicator 
for the receipt of any portal -based R/R.  
 
We will employ intent -to-treat analyses using mixed effects logistic  regression models with practice  random 
effects, an approach recommended for RCTs in which the goal is to  estimate the causal effects of interventions 
on individuals, adjusted for patient correlation within practice. I n addition to the treatment variable, the 
covariates in the model will  include patient age (6m -17y, 18 -64y, 65+y),  race/ethnicity, gender, primary 
language, degree of portal use, flu vaccination in prior year, and practice type  (internal medicine, family 
medicine, pediatric). This method performs well in situations where the  number of  observations per cluster is 
large and for unequal cluster sizes. Hypothesis tests will be two -sided and a p value <  0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant. We will use SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute In  c., Cary, NC).  
 
Hyp 2a.2: More R/R messages will incrementally increase vaccine rates (3 R/R > 2 R/R > 1 R/R > 0 R/R): As  
above, we will use mixed effects logistic regression models.  
The major difference for these analyses is that we  will test for pairwise differences between consecutive study 
arms. With linear contrasts we can determine if each  additional R/R increases vaccination rates. Bonferroni 
corrections will be applied to account for multiple  comparisons. The expected sample size provides >90% 
[ADDRESS_13952] an OR of 1.13 between  consecutive study arms (corresponding to a 3% 
increase in vaccination rates from the baseline rate of 42%).  
 
Statistical Analysis - Subgroup analysis  
We will test Hyp. 2a.1 and 2a.2 stratifying by [CONTACT_654] (6m -17y, 18 -64y, 65+ y) and race/ethnicity  
(Hispanic, NH Black, NH Asian, NH White). We will apply Bonferroni corrections to account for multiple  
comparisons.  
 
Statistical Analysis - Process measures  
Because other process measures (# visits, # vaccination or nurse visits, and # missed  opportunities) are count 
outcomes, we will use negative binomial mixed effects models to compare incidence  rates between arms, 
controlling for the patient and practice covariates mentioned above.

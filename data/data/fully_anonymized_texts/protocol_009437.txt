Protocol Version #3  6 June 14, 2022 1. OBJECTIVES  1.1. Primary Objective  To examine the rate of bleeding events in patients receiving oral api[INVESTIGATOR_550980].   1.2. Secondary Objectives   To examine the rate of VTE events in patients receiving oral api[INVESTIGATOR_550980].  2. BACKGROUND  2.1 Study Disease   Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients undergoing surgery that can have devastating consequences (1-3). While symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) can lead to severe post-thrombotic syndrome in 10% of patients, symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) is the most common cause of preventable in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_550981] a mortality rate of 10% within the hour and 17% at three months (4). The importance of prevention has been recognized and validated instruments, such as the Caprini Risk Assessment Model, have been introduced. These aid in clinical decision-making regarding chemoprophylaxis. The occurrence of ‘breakthrough’ VTE events, defined as the occurrence of VTE events despi[INVESTIGATOR_550982]-compliant chemoprophylaxis, however, highlights the need for changes in clinical practice to improve clinical outcomes.  2.2 Study Agent/Device/Procedure Review of enoxaparin mechanism and pharmacodynamics Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin commonly provided as chemical VTE prophylaxis in surgical patients.  Enoxaparin accelerates the activity of antithrombin, which, in turn, accelerates the rate at which Factor Xa is inactivated.  Factor Xa inactivation results in decreased conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.  Inhibition of this critical step in the coagulation cascade decreases the likelihood that clot will form.  Enoxaparin’s peak response occurs at three to five hours after subcutaneous injection, with a half-life of seven hours.  Enoxaparin metabolism occurs by [CONTACT_550999].  Patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min demonstrate 30% decreased enoxaparin clearance.  Enoxaparin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and an inverse relationship between renal impairment and drug activity.   Review of api[INVESTIGATOR_550983] [ADDRESS_723909] reconstruction has not been approved by [CONTACT_1622].  2.3 Rationale Venous thromboembolism (VTE) continues to be a major patient safety issue after surgical intervention. Significant morbidity and mortality are associated with the development of VTE. With over 100,[ADDRESS_723910] common cause of preventable in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473] (10, 11). Furthermore, the associated economic burden is substantial, with annual costs to the U.S. healthcare system in excess of $7 billion (12).  The importance of VTE prevention has been recognized by [CONTACT_551000]. Significant resources have been 
Protocol Template for Interventional Studies at Stanford Cancer Institute Version 7  
Protocol Version #3  7 June 14, 2022 invested into raising awareness and improving VTE risk stratification and prophylaxis in patients undergoing plastic and reconstructive surgery. Initiatives such as the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) VTE Task Force, the Plastic Surgery Foundation (PSF)-funded VTE Prevention Study (VTEPS) as well as initiatives by [CONTACT_551001] (AAPS) reflect the significant emphasis placed on this particular area of clinical research (3, 11, 13, 14). Important questions, however, remain unanswered and include issues such as appropriate dosing as well as duration of VTE chemoprophylaxis. Furthermore, mechanisms underlying ‘breakthrough’ VTE events, defined as VTE events despi[INVESTIGATOR_550982]-compliant chemoprophylaxis, remain unknown. VTEPS demonstrated that despi[INVESTIGATOR_550984] 1 patient in 25 with a Caprini score >8 had a breakthrough VTE event (3). The occurrence of breakthrough VTE events highlights the need for an improved approach to VTE chemoprophylaxis.  VTE risk stratification and clinical research in other specialties have identified cancer patients as a particularly vulnerable patient population (15, 16). Of these, breast cancer patients represent the largest group treated by [CONTACT_199853]. Symptomatic VTE has been reported in up to 4% of patients undergoing autologous reconstruction using abdominal flaps (17). An up to 20% rate of asymptomatic VTE after autologous reconstruction has been reported (18). In light of rising numbers of breast reconstruction in the U.S., with more than 18,000 autologous reconstructions in 2013, a 35% increase in the number of annual breast reconstructions since 2000, and over 106,[ADDRESS_723911] reconstructions in 2015 alone, the number of patients at risk for VTE is alarmingly high (19-21). It is important to note that an increased rate of DVT formation has been reported following autologous vs. implant-based breast reconstruction despi[INVESTIGATOR_550982]-compliant prophylaxis (22). These findings are particularly relevant in light of an increasing number of patients undergoing prophylactic bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. As such, it is of no surprise that the ASPS VTE Task Force identified “major breast reconstruction” as a procedure warranting additional prophylactic considerations (11). Given the large number of patients at risk, particular emphasis on understanding the processes leading to VTE development in this patient population is warranted. A recent retrospective study in over 1500 patients who underwent body contouring procedures (LMWH [N=454]; rivaroxaban [N=703], api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] [N=415]) demonstrated similar rates of bleeding-related adverse events (37).  2.[ADDRESS_723912] Clinical Trials Directory compliance   • Prevention: protocol designed to assess one or more interventions aimed at preventing the development of a specific disease or health condition  • Parallel: one of two groups in parallel for duration of study.   • 2 intervention arms.    • Open: no masking is used   • Study is randomized.   • Safety/Efficacy; Pharmacokinetics.     3.

The treatment period spans the duration of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. While hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], patients will be evaluated daily for symptomatic VTE (DVT and/or PE) and bleeding events.

INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT/DEVICE/PROCEDURE INFORMATION 5.1 Investigational Agent/Device/Procedure   We previously demonstrated that the majority of plastic surgery patients receive inadequate enoxaparin prophylaxis using fixed daily dosing (5). A follow-up study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in postoperative VTE rate following twice daily administration of enoxaparin (6). The observed clinical differences are explained by [CONTACT_551003]-range peak anti-factor Xa levels (7).   Although enoxaparin is effective, disadvantages include the need for subcutaneous injection as well as dose adjustment based on anti-factor Xa levels. A potentially better alternative is the use of oral, direct factor Xa inhibitors. Importantly, this group has demonstrated superior outcomes in the orthopedic population when compared to enoxaparin (8, 9). Hence, it appears prudent to examine their role in the plastic surgery population.  This project will identify plastic surgery patients who meet criteria for postoperative VTE chemoprophylaxis and 1)

ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  7.[ADDRESS_723921] dose of the study medication was administered (Lassen et al. NEJM 2020;26:2487-2498). Bleeding is categorized as major, clinically relevant nonmajor, or minor bleeding and as the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. The definition of major bleeding is acute, clinically overt bleeding accompanied by [CONTACT_265672]: a decrease in the hemoglobin level of 2 g per deciliter or more over a 24-hour period; transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red cells; bleeding at a critical site (including intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, pericardial, and retroperitoneal bleeding); bleeding into the operated joint, necessitating reoperation or intervention; intramuscular bleeding with the compartment syndrome; or fatal bleeding. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding includes acute, clinically overt epi[INVESTIGATOR_550988], bruising or ecchymosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemoptysis, hematuria, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_550989]. Bleeding is categorized as minor if it is clinically overt but is not adjudicated as major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.   7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  All bleeding/thrombotic Adverse Events will be tracked by [CONTACT_551004]. All unanticipated adverse events and SAE’s will be reported to the IRB. Annual summaries of adverse events will be reported to the IRB.  Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.03.  Both Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific Case Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse Event (AE) to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure, and related to the investigation. All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution, or until [ADDRESS_723922] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following review by [CONTACT_6802], events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the IRB using eProtocol within [ADDRESS_723923] Cancer Institute Version 7

Study Number: MLN0002SC -3027 Phase: 3
Study Design:
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , placebo -controlled 
trial, including a vedolizumab intravenous ( vedolizumab IV) reference arm, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of maintenance treatment with vedolizumab subcutaneous (vedolizumab SC) in adult subjects with moderately 
to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who achieved a clinical response at Week 6 following open -label therapy 
with 300 mg vedolizumab IV administered at Weeks 0 and 2. The study includes a vedolizumab IV reference arm to 
allow for wit hin study descriptive comparisons on efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity between the two vedolizumab 
presentations.
Moderately to severely active UC is defined as a complete Mayo score of 6 to 12 points with endoscopic subscore of 
≥2. Subjects that are tu mor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α) antagonist na ïve or with TNF -α antagonist failure will be 
included, ensuring that approximately 50% of subjects with TNF -α antagonist failure are enrolled. Subjects with 
previous use of TNF -αantagonist but not failed will NOT be enrolled.
Primary Objectives:
To assess the effect of vedolizumab SC maintenance treatment on clinical remission at Week 52 in subjects with 
moderately to severely active UC who achieved clinical response at Week 6 following administration of 
vedo lizumab IV at Weeks 0 and 2.
Secondary Objectives:
To determine the effect of vedolizumab SC maintenance treatment on mucosal healing at Week 52 in subjects 
who achieved clinical response at Week 6 following administration of vedolizumab IV at Weeks 0 and 2.
To determine the effect of vedolizumab SC maintenance treatment on durable clinical response at Week 52 in 
subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 6 following administration of vedolizumab IV at Weeks 0 and 2.
To determine the effect of vedoliz umab SC maintenance treatment on durable clinical remission at Week 52 in 
subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 6 following administration of vedolizumab IV at Weeks 0 and 2.
To determine the effect of vedolizumab SC maintenance treatment on cort icosteroid free remission at Week [ADDRESS_1095202] Population: Adult subjects with UC, aged 18 -80 years inclusive.
Number of Subjects: 
Approximately 400 subjects enrolled to enable approximately 188 subjects 
to be randomized for maintenance treatment.Number of Sites: 
Approximately 250 sites globally.

Subjects who do not participate in the 
open -label extension (OLE) study will 
be required to participate in a Final 
Safety Visit 18-weeks after the las t 
study drug dose (Week 50 or early 
termination [ET]) and a long -term 
follow -up (LTFU) safety survey by 
[CONTACT_82261], [ADDRESS_1095203] dose 
of study drug.
Main Criteria for Inclusion:
The subject has a diagnosis of UC established at least [ADDRESS_1095204] has moderately to severely active UC as determined by a complete Mayo score of 6 -12 with an endoscopic 
subscore ≥[ADDRESS_1095205] has evidence of UC extending proximal to the rectum ( ≥15 cm of involved colon).
The subject has demonstrated an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance of at least 1 of the 
following agents: immunomodu lators, corticosteroids, or TNF -α antago nists.
Main Criteria for Exclusion:
The subject has had extensive colonic resection, subtotal or total colectomy.
The subject has any evidence of an active infection during screening. 
The subject has a positive progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) subjective checklist at Screening (or at 
Week 0 before the administration of study drug). 
The subject has received any investigational or approved biologic or biosimilar within [ADDRESS_1095206] has had prior exposure to natalizumab, efalizumab, or rituximab.
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses: 
The primary endpoint for t his study  is the proportion of subjects with clinical remission, defined as a complete Mayo 
score of ≤2 points and no individual subcore >1 point, at Week 52.
Secondary endpoints for this study are:
Proportio n of subjects with mucosal healing (defined as M ayo endoscopic subscore of ≤1 point) at Week 52.
Proportio n of subjects with durable clinical response (defined as clinical response at Weeks 6 and 52, where 
Vedolizumab SC

CONFIDENTIALclinical response is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from Base line (Week 0) 
with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 
point).
Proportio n of subjects with durable clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at Weeks 6 and 52).
Proportio n of s ubjects with corticosteroid-free remission (defined as subjects using oral corticosteroids at 
Baseline (Week 0) who have discontinued oral corticosteroids and are in clinical remission at Week 52). 
Statistical Considerations:
All statistical testing will be performed at 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_1095207] secondary endpoint w ill only be performed if the primary endpoint is statistically significant and 
so on for each subsequent secondary endpoint. 
All dichotomous efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel tests for risk differences, 
stratified by [CONTACT_794198] n stratum. All subjects with missing data for determination of endpoint status will be 
considered as a nonresponder in the analysis.
Sample Size Justification: 
Assuming a clinical remission rate of 42% for vedolizumab and 16% for placebo at Week 52, a sample size of 
94subjects in the vedolizumab SC group, 47 subjects in the placebo group will provide 90% power at 2 -sided 0.05 
level of significance. To ensure a r andomized sample size of 188 subjects, assuming 47% of the subjects entering 
inductio n will achieve clinical response at Week 6, approximately [ADDRESS_1095208] ivities in full or in partnership with the sponsor.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Diseases and Current Treatments 
Inflammatory  bowel  disease (IBD) i s a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory  disorder of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract that includes 2 ent ities, namely ulcerat ive colit is (UC) and Crohn’s 
disease (CD). 
UC i s characteri zed by  [CONTACT_260214], superficial inflammat ion of the colonic mucosa that begins in the 
rectum  and extends proximally  to invo lve any cont iguous length of co lon. The prevalence of UC is 
approximately  200/100,000 of the [LOCATION_002] populat ion and approximately 150/100,000 of the 
popul ation in Western Europe [1-3]and 63.6/100,000 of the populat ion in Japan [4].A genetic 
contribution to the disease is indicated by [CONTACT_260215] o f UC (of 30 to 100 times that of 
the general populat ion) am ongfirst-degree relatives of patients with UC. The characteristic 
pathol ogy is one of chronic inflammat ion characteri zed by [CONTACT_465144] o f lymphocy tes and 
histiocytes in the diseased mucosa and submucosa with an acute inflammatory infiltrate composed 
of neutrophils vari ably present.
Clinical manifestations of UC include diarrhea, ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_260202] , as well  as abdominal pain, fecal 
urgency, and incont inence. Systemic features such as fever, weight loss, malaise, and fat igue are 
indicators of more extensive di sease. Extra -intestinal manifestations such as uveit is, arthrit is, 
ankylo sis spondylit is, or primary sclerosing cho langitis may also be seen in conjunct ion with IBD.  
The di agnosis of UC is usually  made by [CONTACT_260217] , 
physical examinat ion, in co mbinat ion with laboratory  and imaging studies.
Current treatments have been effective for many patients with UC but have numerous limitat ions 
for pati ents wi th moderately to severely act ive disease. 5- aminosalicylates (5 -ASAs) are the 
mainstay  of UC pharmacotherapy  for induct ion and maintenance of remissio n for patients with 
mild to m oderate di sease, but are less effective in moderate to severe disease. [5,6]. 
Corti costeroi ds are often required for the 1/3 of patients who fail to respond to 5 -ASAs [7,8] . 
While highly effect ive for induct ion of remissio n, corti costeroi ds are not recommended for 
maintenance of remissio n and carry  significant und esirable side effects, including osteoporosis, 
glucose intol erance, and increased risk of infect ion. 
Immunomodulatory  agents, including [ADDRESS_1095211] a role in 
maintenance of remissio n in moderately to severely  active UC. Thei r relatively slow onset of 
action precludes their use during flares of disease, and the use o f these agents has been reported to 
potenti ally increase the ri sk of lymphoma in patients with IBD [9]. Other severe adverse events 
(AEs) associated with use of immuno modulators i nclude cy topenias, hepat itis, and infection.
Intravenous (IV) cy closporine has a role in the management of severely  active UC; however, it is 
impract ical in non -hospi [INVESTIGATOR_9643], requi res intense monitoring, and may cause irreversible 
nephrotoxi city, all of which limit its use.

CONFIDENTIALMonoclonal  antibodies (mAbs) di rected against tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF- α) have been 
approved for the treatment of UC in many countries world -wide, including infliximab (Remicade), 
which is administered by [CONTACT_113925] n, and adalimumab (Humira) and go limumab (Simponi ), 
which are administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection [10-12 ]. These agents have substant ially 
improved the care of patients with UC by [CONTACT_260218] n and decreasing the 
need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_260204], and other complicat ions. Alt hough TNF -α antagoni sts 
represent an important a ddition to the UC pharmacologic armamentarium, they  are effect ive in

39% of patients with UC [15] and durable clinical remission (ie, defined as clinical remissio n at 
Weeks 8, 30, and 54 ) occurs in only 26% of pat ients with UC. In addit ion, controlled studies have 
demonstrated that, after failure of [ADDRESS_1095213], a patient’s response to a second TNF -α

serious safet y concerns based on their suppressio n of systemic immunit y, including react ivation of 
tubercul osis (TB); various bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infect ions; and malignancies, 
such as hepatosplenic T cell lympho ma [10,11] .

4.1.2 Vedolizumab
Vedolizumab (also known a s MLN0002) is a novel reco mbinant humanized mAb co mposed of 
2light chains o f the subclass and 2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 heavy  chains. Vedolizumab binds 
specifically to the human lymphocy te integrin 47. The α 4β7integrin mediates lymphocy te 
trafficking to GI mucosa and gut -associ ated lymphoid t issue (GALT) through adhesive interact ion 
with mucosal addressin cell adhesio n molecule -1(MAdCAM -1), which is expressed on the 
endothelium o f mesenteri c lymph nodes and GI mucosa [20-23] . As a result, vedolizum ab impairs 
the migrat ion of gut -homing leukocytes into GI mucosa [24] andacts as a gut -selective 
immuno modulator.
Vedolizumab IV (also known as ENTYVIO; KYNTELES; Vedolizumab for Inject ion, for 
Intravenous Use; Vedo lizumab Powder for Concentrate for Solut ion for Infusion; or MLN0002 
IV) has been granted market ing approval in several regio ns, including the United State s (US) and 
European Unio n (EU). Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with 
moderately  to severely act ive UC and CD, who have failed convent ional treatment, such as 
immuno modulators, corticosteroids, or TNF -α antagonists. The approv ed dosing and 
administration regimen is 300 mg vedo lizumab IV infused intravenously at Weeks 0 and 2, then 
once every  8 weeks (Q8W) thereafter, beginning at Week 6.

CONFIDENTIALVedolizumab SC (also known as Vedolizumab Injection, for Subcutaneous Use; Vedolizumab 
Solution for Injection in Pre-filled Syringe; or MLN0002 SC) is a new liquid presentation that has 
been developed for SC administration.  
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the nonclinical and clinical information from studies with vedolizumab 
IV are considered relevant.

[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have b een conducted with vedolizumab and its murine 
homologue, Act-1. Act-1 has demonstrated clinical and histomorphologic evidence of efficacy in 
an animal model of IBD (cotton-top tamarins). Extensive nonclinical evaluations of the 
cardiovascular, acute, local, subchronic, c hronic, immunologic, and reproductive toxicity of 
vedolizumab in pharmacologically responsive species (New Zealand white rabbits and 
cynomolgus monkeys) have been conducted and support its clinical development. Nonclinical 
studies also show that vedolizumab does not antagonize #4∃1integrin [ 24].
A single-dose local tolerance study was conducted to determine the local irritancy potential of 
vedolizumab SC when administered by [CONTACT_794200]. Macroscopic and histological 
examinations of the injection sites indicated no findings of concern with the vehicle or formulated vedolizumab SC.

Vedolizumab has shown an acceptable safet y profile based on an analysis o f safet y data from both 
completed and ongoing studies (see current edit ion of IB). In phase 1 and 2 clinical trials 
(7completed phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and 8 completed phase 1b/2 studies in UC or CD 
subjects), there was no consistent evidence of any dose- toxicity relationships, and vedo lizumab 
was well -tolerated. The m ajority of the safet y data is fro m 3 wel l-controlled, phase 3 clinical 
studi es that eval uated the safet y of vedolizumab IV for up to 12 months in subjects with UC

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Experience With Vedolizumab SC
The feasibilit y of administering the vedo lizumab IV formulat ion by [CONTACT_82269] (IM) injection was explored in an open -label, single dose, parallel -group 
bioavailabilit y study  (C13010) in healt hy male subjec ts. In thi s study , 42 subjects were enrolled 
and 14 subjects each received a single dose of 180 mg vedolizumab IV as IV infusio n (over 
30minutes), SC inject ions (2 × 1.5 mL × 60 mg/mL), or IM injections (2 × 1.5 mL × 60 mg/mL). 
Following SC administration , absorpti on of  vedo lizumab was gradual, achieving maximum 
concentration at [ADDRESS_1095221] ion (time to reach maximum serum concentration [t max]). The 
maximum observed serum concentration (C max) following SC inject ion was approximately 1/3 of 
the C maxfollowing 30 minute IV infusio n. There was no difference in the terminal eliminat ion 
profile of the SC cohort compared to the IV cohort, indicating that the eliminat ion of vedo lizumab 
is not absorption rate -limited. The abso lute bioavailabilit y of vedo lizum ab was approximately  
75% for SC administration. Vedo lizumab was well tolerated when administered at a dose of 
180mg by [CONTACT_57982]. Five of the 14 subjects (36%) in the IV infusio n cohort and 3 of the 
14subjects (21%) in the SC cohort experienced a drug -related AE (assessed by [CONTACT_3170]). 
Most AEs were mild or moderate in severit y. Three of the 14 subjects (21%) in the IV infusio n 
cohort and 2 of the 14 subjects (14%) in the SC cohort in this study were AVA posit ive using the 
originally developed AVA assay that was used in the phase [ADDRESS_1095222] ion of vedo lizumab SC at 
3dose levels (54, 108, and 160 mg) relat ive to a single IV infusio n of vedolizumab IV 300 mg was 
examined in a phase 1, open -label study  (MLN0002SC -101). Forty -eight (24 Japanese and 
Vedolizumab SC
Study No. MLN0002SC-3027 Page 25 of 109Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 05 28 September 2016
CONFIDENTIAL24 non-Japanese) healthy, adult male and fema le subjects were randomized, A total of 12 subjects 
received a single dose of vedolizumab IV 300 mg and 36 subjects received a single dose of 
vedolizumab SC at 54, 108, or 160 mg (12 subjects per dose group).
The bioavailability following a single SC injection of vedolizumab SC was 75.1%, independent of 
the vedolizumab SC dose evaluated (54, 108, or 160 mg). Vedolizumab reached maximum serum 
concentrations around 1 week after a single SC injection. Vedolizumab was eliminated by [CONTACT_82270], with more rapid elimination with 
decreasing dose/concentration. Compared with non-Japanese subjects, Japanese subjects generally 
showed similar or slightly higher exposure; howev er, ethnicity did not have an impact on clearance 
or central volume of distribution based on the populat ion PK analysis, likely due to the fact that 
weight was included as a covariate for various population PK parameters. Simulations further 
confirmed that vedolizumab SC at 108 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) is expected to provide lower 
trough concentrations at steady state than vedolizumab IV 300 mg Q4W and similar steady-state 
exposures (average serum c oncentration at steady state [C av,ss]) to that from the approved 
vedolizumab IV 300 mg Q8W maintenance regimen.
An electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay has been developed to determine serum titers of AVA. 
This assay has improved drug tolerance as compared to the prior enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) method used in the vedolizumab clinical development program and, as a result, is 
more sensitive. Both assays were used in Study MLN0002SC-101; the ECL assay data were used 
in the analysis of PK and safety.
Overall, 75.0% (36/48) of subjects had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and the 
percentage of subjects with a TEAE was ident ical in sub jects who received vedolizumab SC 
compared with subjects who received vedolizumab IV. All TEAEs were considered by [CONTACT_82271]; no TEAEs of severe intensity were reported. The 
percentage of subjects with mild or moderate TEAEs was similar between subjects who received 
vedolizumab SC and vedolizumab IV; the percentages were also similar across the dose groups. 
No subjects had clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) results that 
were reported as AEs. Two subjects had elevated bilirubin levels that met the predefined markedly 
abnormal value criteria; however, no subject had abnormal liver function test (LFT) results 
involving aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alaninine aminotransferase (ALT).
Two AEs of special interest were reported: [ADDRESS_1095223] in the vedolizumab SC CCI

observed at the 30 minute postdose observation time point (a protocol -defined time point). In each 
case, the event resolved at the 1.5 hour postdose observation time point and was considered by [CONTACT_82272]. Both subjects recovered without any 
sequelae.
No SAEs, severe AEs, or deaths were reported in Study MLN00002SC-101. The observed AEs are 
consistent with the overall safety profile of vedolizumab.
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
As IV infusion may not be convenient as long-ter m therapy for some patients, vedolizumab SC has 
been developed to enable injection by [CONTACT_82273]. 
This phase 3 study is designed to evaluate  the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of 
multiple injections of the new presentation, vedolizumab SC, as maintenance therapy in subjects 
with UC.
 
 
 Therefore, all nonclinical and 
clinical information from studies with vedolizumab IV is considered relevant. 
The vedolizumab exposure-efficacy r elations hip has been demonstrated in UC subjects in the 
phase 3 vedolizumab IV study (C13006), where higher serum vedolizumab concentrations were 
associated with higher eff icacy (Source: Population PK Efficacy Report 2013). The proposed 
vedolizumab SC maintenance dosing regimen (108 mg Q2W) was selected to provide lower 
steady-state trough concentrations than the ve dolizumab IV Q4W dosing regimen and similar 
Cavg steady-state exposures to that from the approved vedolizumab IV Q8W dosing regimen, and 
the safety and efficacy of the vedolizumab SC presentation are expected to be similar to those of 
vedolizumab IV, outside of expected local administration site events, such as injection-site 
reactions.
4.3 Benefit-Risk Assessment
The proposed study (MLN0002SC-3027) is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
vedolizumab SC as maintenance therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who 
achieved clinical response following open-label vedo lizumab IV therapy. Because IV infusion 
may not be convenient as long-term therapy, vedolizumab SC has been developed to  ultimately 
enable injection by [CONTACT_82273].  CCI

Therefore, the 
nonclinical and clinical information from studies with vedolizumab IV are considered relevant.
The study population in Study MLN0002SC-3027 is consistent with the approved vedolizumab IV 
label. The proposed vedolizumab SC maintenance dosing regimen (108 mg Q2W) was selected to 
provide similar steady- state exposure to that from the approved vedolizumab IV dosing regimen 
(300 mg Q8W). It is expected that similar steady-state exposure to vedolizumab will result in 
similar maintenance efficacy, independent of the dosing route or presentation. In addition, safety 
of the vedolizumab SC presentation is expected to be similar to that of vedolizumab IV due to 
similar exposure, outside of expected local administration site events, such as injection-site 
reactions. Results from a phase [ADDRESS_1095224] that administration of vedolizumab SC (rather than 
IV) may result in higher immunogenicity; however, the clinical significance of these results is 
unclear, since this was a single-dose study in healthy subjects. The observed AEs with 
vedolizumab SC are consistent with the vedolizumab IV safety profile. 
Overall, vedolizumab has been well tolerated in clinical studies, including a phase 1 study of 
vedolizumab SC, and has a positive benefit-risk profile in the treatment of UC.CCI

CONFIDENTIAL6.2 Justification for Study Design, Dose, and Endpoints
This phase 3 study is designed to evaluate  the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of 
multiple injections of the new presentation, vedolizumab SC, as maintenance therapy in subjects 
with UC. The proposed vedolizumab SC maintenance dosing regimen (108 mg Q2W) was 
selected to provide similar steady-state exposures to that from the approved vedolizumab IV 
dosing regimen (300 mg Q8W), and the safety and efficacy of the vedolizumab SC presentation is 
expected to be similar to that of vedolizumab IV, outside of expected local administration site 
events, such as in jection-site reactions. 
The study design allows for independent assessments of vedolizumab SC efficacy as maintenance 
therapy in subjects who responded to vedolizumab IV by [CONTACT_794203]. It also permits double-blind, 
placebo-controlled comparisons of safety parameters during the Maintenance Phase. Additional 
measures will be taken to collect safety parameters beyond the 52-week duration of the trial, where 
subjects who do not enroll in OLE will have a Final Safety Visit conducted [ADDRESS_1095233]’s last dose of study drug, and additional safety information will be collected by [CONTACT_794204] a LTFU survey at [ADDRESS_1095234] study dose (for both SC and IV dosing).
Consistent with the currently approved vedolizumab IV label, subjects who do not achieve a 
clinical response at Week [ADDRESS_1095235] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ie, corticosteroids, 
immunomodulators, or TNF- α antagonists), will be enrolled into the study. Entry criteria will also 
exclude subjects who might not benefit from drug or who might be at risk for treatment toxicities. 
Additional measures to ensure the safety of en rolled subjects include protocol-mandated criteria 
for withdrawal from the study of subjects who e xperience worsening of disease or require rescue 
medication (ie, any new medication or any increase in dose of a baseline medication required to 
treat new or unresolved UC symptoms, other than antidiarrheals for control of chronic diarrhea). 
Thus, subjects who may be treated with placebo (inactive treatment) between Weeks 6 and 52 will 
be withdrawn from the study if they experience treatment failure (ie, disease worsening, need for 
rescue medications), but may be eligible to enroll in the OLE study.
At Week 6, subjects receiving oral corticosteroi ds who achieve clinical response must begin a 
corticosteroid tapering regimen as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  Subjects are allowed to continue 
background therapy such as 5-ASAs or immunomodulators, as indicated in the Permitted 
Medications and Treatments in Section  7.3.1.CCI
Vedolizumab SC
Study No. MLN0002SC-[ADDRESS_1095236] indicator of disease activity in UC subjects. 
Exposure-efficacy analyses were conducted using either observed or population model predicted 
vedolizumab concentrations from the phase 3 vedolizumab IV studies. There was an apparent 
exposure-efficacy relationship in subjects with UC for both the Induction and Maintenance 
Phases, where higher vedolizumab concentrations were associated with higher efficacy. Based on 
the exposure-efficacy r elations hip for vedolizumab IV, the vedolizumab SC dosing regimen was 
selected to provide lower trough concentrations than vedolizumab IV Q4W and similar exposure 
to that from the approved vedolizumab IV Q8W regimen during the Maintenance Phase. It is 
expected that similar exposure to vedolizumab will result in similar efficacy and safety during 
maintenance, independent of the dosing route or formulation.
In addition to efficacy and safety evaluat ions, the multiple dose PK and immunogenicity of 
vedolizumab SC in subjects during the Maintenance Phase will be evaluated in this study. Given 
the long half-life of vedolizumab (approximately 25 days), blood samples will be collected up to 
18 weeks (>5 half-lives) after the last dose of study drug to assess the PK of vedolizumab.
During the Maintenance Phase of this study, vedolizumab SC or placebo SC injections will be 
administered by [CONTACT_82279] (Weeks 6, 8, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46 
and 50 under HCP supervision) and outside of the clinic, while vedolizumab IV and placebo IV 
infusions will be administered by [CONTACT_794205] (Weeks 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46). 
HCPs will train the subjects (and their caregivers) on the adequate technique to prepare and inject 
study drug during at least at the Week [ADDRESS_1095237] information for any questions on vedolizumab SC use. Details on the 
training protocol and injection technique will be included in the appropriate Study Manual. 
Pharmacogenomic analysis may be conducted to evaluate the contribution of genetic variance on 
drug response, eg, its efficacy and safety. Participation of study subjects in pharmacogeno mic 
sample collection is optional (Section  9.1.16) . As pharmacogenomics is an evolving science, 
currently many genes and their function are not yet fully understood. Future data may suggest a 
role of some of these genes in drug response and disease, which may lead to additional 
hypothesis-generating exploratory research on stored samples.
If future analysis is required, the sponsor will create a research protocol for pharmacogenomics 
investigations and the research protocol will require prior approval by [CONTACT_448403] (IRB) prior to implementation (Japan only).CCI

diarrhea; stable doses are encouraged.
–Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, provided that the dose has been stable for the [ADDRESS_1095268] dose of study  drug. Dose(s) shoul d rem ain stable, unless the 
medicat ion is discontinued due to a toxicit y related to the medicat ion. Even if the toxicit y 
resolves, azathioprine or 6 -mercaptopurine will not be re -started.
For immunosuppressives, oral 5- ASAs, probiotics and ant ibiotics for UC, dose reduction or 
discontinuat ion per label will be allowed only due to adverse react ions. For oral corticosteroid, 
asper the tapering schedule (see Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Need for Rescue Medications : In this study, any new medication or any increase in dose of a 
baseline medication required to treat new or unresolved UC symptoms (other than 
antidiarrheals for control of chronic diarrhea) is considered a rescue medicat ion. An increase in 
corticosteroi d dose back to baseline for subjects undergoing corticosteroid tapering within the 
guidelines presented in Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS] is not considered rescue medicat ion. Administration o f 
rescue m edicati ons, approved or invest igational, constitutes treatment failure. Rescue 
medicat ions should not be withheld if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_35272], failure to prescribe 
them woul d com promise subject safet y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Oral Corticosteroid Dosing and Tapering 
At Week 6, subjects receiving oral corticosteroids who achieved clinical response will begin a
corticosteroi d tapering regimen. The tapering schedule is as fo llows: 
–For prednisone at doses >10 mg/day (or equivalent), the dose should be reduced at a rate of 
5mg/week unt il a 10 m g/day  dose is reached. 
–For predni sone at doses ≤10 m g/day  (or equivalent) or once a 10 mg/day dose (or 
equivalent) is achieved by [CONTACT_39782], the dose should be reduced at a rate of 2.5 mg/week 
until discontinuation.
For subjects who cannot tolerate the corticosteroid taper without recurrence of clinical symptoms, 
corticosteroi ds may  be increased up to the original dose at the start of induct ion therapy  (shoul d 
not exceed baseline dose). In such cas es, the tapering regimen above must be reinit iated within 
2weeks. Subjects who consistent ly cannot be tapered should be wit hdrawn from the study  
according to Section 7.4.
Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of premedicat ion 
(eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving vedo lizumab; hence, such premedicat ion 
is unlikely  to be necessary  or be neficial. At the discretion of the investigator, however, subjects 
may be administered premedicat ion prior to any  study  drug administration. Corticosteroids, if 
given as a premedication, should be limited to the day  of administrati on.

2.Significant protocol  deviat ion. The discovery  after the first dose of study  medicat ion that the 
subject failed to m eet protocol  entry  criteria or di d not adhere to protocol requirements, and 
continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health.
3.Lost to follow -up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact [CONTACT_794206]. Three attempts to con tact the subject must be documented (ie, 2 attempts 
by [CONTACT_17084] 1 attempt by  [CONTACT_50202] l etter).
4.Voluntary  withdrawal. The subject (or subject’s legally  acceptable representative) wishes to 
withdraw from  the stu dy. The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the 
eCRF.
Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, 
where possible, the primary  underlying reason should be recorded (ie, withdrawal due to an 
AE or l ack of  efficacy shoul d not be recorded in the “vo luntary withdrawal” category ). 
5.Study  terminat ion. The sponsor, IRB, IEC, or regulatory  agency  terminates the study .
6. Pregnancy. The subject is found to be pregnant. 
Note: If the subject is found to be pregnant, the subject must be withdrawn immediately. The 
procedure is described in Sect ion 9.1.[ADDRESS_1095270] should be discont inued fro m the study  if the fo llowing cri teria 
apply:
Week [ADDRESS_1095271] vedo lizumab IV infusio ns at Week 6.
Treatment failure during the Maintenance Phase, defined as disease worsening (as defined 
in Section 3.5), need for rescue medicat ions (as defined in Sect ion 7.3.1 ), or need for 
surgi cal interventi on for treat ment of UC.
Leukopenia or Lymphopenia: WBC and lymphocyte counts will be monitored for all subjects. 
Azathioprine, or 6 -mercaptopurine, if applicable, should be discontinued and the dose of study 
drug held for an abso lute lymphocyte count <0.5 × 109/L at a ny po int in the study. The abso lute 
lymphocy te count m ust be repeated at appropriate intervals as determined by [CONTACT_3170]. 
The next dose of study drug can be administered only if the abso lute lymphocyte count is ≥0.5 
× 109/L. If the abso lute lymphoc yte count remains <0.5 × 109/L, study  drug shoul d be 
discontinued and the subject withdrawn fro m the study .

the WPAI-UC to assess the impact on loss of work productivity and activity impairment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire
The IBDQ is a valid and reliable [ 30]instrument used to assess health-related quality of life 
(HRQOL) in adult subjects with IBD. It includes 32 questions on 4 domains of HRQOL: Bowel 
Systems (10 items), Emotional Function (12 items), Social Function (5 items), and Systemic 
Function (5 items). Subjects are asked to recall symptoms and quality of life from the last 2 weeks 
and rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale (higher scores equate to higher quality of life). A total 
IBDQ score is calculated by [CONTACT_82293]; the total IBDQ score ranges 
from 32 to 224.
[IP_ADDRESS] EQ-5D Questionnaire
The EQ-5D questionnaire, developed by [CONTACT_941] ‘EuroQol Research Foundation’ is a simple, valid, 
and reliable [ 31]instrument used to measure general HRQOL in subjects and includes five domain 
items - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discom fort, and anxiety/depression. Subjects 
choose the level of health problems they currently have on each item as “None”, “Moderate”, or 
“Extreme” and are scored a 1, 2, or 3, respectively. A composite EQ-5D score can be calculated 
from the individual scores to assess overall HRQOL. The EQ-5D visual analog score (VAS) score 
is a self-assigned rating of overall health using a [ADDRESS_1095307] been CCI

The WPAI questionnaire is a valid and reliable [32] 6-item instrument that consists of four metrics: 
absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one’s healt h in the past seven days), 
presenteeism (the percenta ge of impairment experienced while at work in the past seven days 
because of one’s healt h), overall work productivit y loss (an overall impairment estimate that is a 
combinat ion of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activit y impairment (the percentage of 
impairment in daily  activi ties because of one’s healt h in the past seven days). The sum of specific 
healt h problem impairment and impairment due to other health reasons is equal to impairment due 
to all healt h reasons. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairme nt percentages, with higher

CONFIDENTIAL10.0 PRETREATMENT EVENTS (PTE), ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND PRODUCT 
COMPLAINTS (PC)
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 PTEs
A Pre -Treatment Event (PTE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
investigat ion subject wh o has signed informed consent to participate in a study  but pri or to 
administration of any  study  medicat ion; it does not necessarily  have to have a causal relat ionship 
with study  parti cipat ion.
10.1.[ADDRESS_1095317] 
administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  finding), sympto m, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
In addit ion, drug -device AEs related to qualit y or malfunct ion will be collected.
10.1.[ADDRESS_1095318] fin ding generally  may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre exist ing condit ions underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168].
PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) s hould be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. I f a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Vedolizumab SC
Study No. MLN0002SC -3027 Page 68of 109
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 05 28 September 2016
CONFIDENTIALLaboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG paramete rs are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if the y 
are judged to be c linically significant (ie, if so me action or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  re-test and/or continued monitoring o f an abnormal value are not consider ed an 
intervent ion. In addit ion, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are c onsidered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, l aboratory  tests, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless 
related to study  procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsen ing or com plicati on 
of such a concurrent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medicat ion) or 
an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after start of study medication). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_45285], serious or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurr ent condi tion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).

CONFIDENTIALChanges in severit y of AEs /Seri ous PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a prepl anned procedure is 
perform ed early  (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the 
worsening of the condit ion should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complicat ions 
resul ting fro m any planned surgery  shoul d be re ported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions resu lting from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion, should NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The invest igator must make the dist inction bet ween exacerbation o f pre-exist ing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the eCRF. Any 
manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of 
the eCRF.
10.1.[ADDRESS_1095319] medical occurrence that at any  dose:

The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the f ollowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonabl y be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related. 
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE /PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or physician.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died.

Dose not ch anged –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable –a study  medicat ion was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE eg,

Recovered/Resolved – Subject returned to first a ssessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore stages: the di agnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not

CONFIDENTIAL13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS
13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A stati stical analysis plan (SAP) will b e prepared and finalized prior to database lock and 
unblinding of subjects’ treatment assignments. This document will provide further details 
regarding the definit ion of analysis variables and analysis methodology  to address all study  
objectives.
A blinded data review meeting will be conducted prior to unblinding of subjects’ treatment 
assignment and database lock. This review will assess the accuracy and completeness of the stud y 
database, subject evaluabilit y, and appropriateness of the planned statist ical methods.
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
study  drug. Subj ects in this set will be analyzed according to the treatment they  were randomized 
to receive.
The per -protocol (PP) populat ion is a subset of the intent -to-treat populat ion. The PP population 
consists of all subjects who do not vio late the terms of the protocol in a way that would impact the 
study  output significant ly. All decisio ns to exclude subjects for the per -proto col population dataset 
will be made prior to the unblinding of the study. Analyses using the per- protocol  population may 
be provided as a sensit ivity analysis.
The Safet y Analysis Set will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_1095343] ics (number of 
subjects, mean, sta ndard deviat ion, minimum, median, and maximum). For categorical variables, 
the summary  will consist of number and percentage of subjects in each category .
Medical history and concurrent medical condit ions will be summarized by [CONTACT_794217] . Medi cation history  and conco mitant medicat ions will be summarized by [CONTACT_39813].
13.1.[ADDRESS_1095344] ics of treatment effects and corresponding 95% CIs for the IV arm versus 
placebo for the prima ry and secondary  efficacy  endpoints will be presented.
The comparison between vedo lizumab IV and placebo groups will be considered exploratory  and 
hence will not be included in the mult iplicit y control procedure described above. All dichotomous 
efficacy  endpoints will be analyzed using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel tests for risk differences, 
stratified by [CONTACT_35876]. The descript ive statist ics of treatment effects and 
corresponding 95% CIs for the IV arm versus placebo for the primary  and secondary ef ficacy  
endpo ints will be presented. All subjects with missing data for determinat ion of endpo int status 
will be considered as a non -responder in the analysis. 
13.1.4 Resource Utilization and Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)
All statist ical test ing will be performed at 2 -sided 0.05 level o f significance. To control the overall 
Type I error rate for the comparison between vedo lizumab SC and placebo groups, a hierarchy 
approach will be applied to the PRO endpoints if the primary endpoint i s significant. 
The order of testing of PRO endpo ints in Section 5.2.3 will be finalized in SAP before database 
lock. 
Changes fro m Base line to Week 52 in IBDQ, EQ -5D scores and WPAI -UC com ponents will be 
analyzed in an Analysis of Covariance model wit h treatm ent as a factor and baseline score as a 
covari ate. Changes fro m Week 6 to Week 52 will be analyzed in a similar fashion.
13.1.5 Pharmacokin etic Analysis
Concentrations of vedo lizumab in serum will be summarized by [CONTACT_794218]. Individual serum concentration data versus time will be presented in a data 
listing.
A separate Data Analysis Plan will be create d to describe the populat ion PK analysis approach for 
this study . The results of all PK parameters derived fro m populat ion PK analysis will be described

Study No. MLN0002SC -[ADDRESS_1095345]-baseline sample, and is further categorized as:
Transient ly posit ive: defined as subjects with confirmed positive AVA in [ADDRESS_1095346]-dose visit.
Persi stently posi tive: defined as subjec ts wi th confirmed posit ive AVA in [ADDRESS_1095347] -dose visits.
The serum t iters of AVA are defined as low (<250), moderate (25 0-2500) and high (>6250). 
Note: these are subject to change depending on the dilution factor that is used at the time of testing.
The ECL assay has better drug tolerance than the ELISA assay used in previous clinical trials 
(including the phase 3 registration studies wit h vedolizumab IV), therefore allowing more samples 
that have higher drug levels or sam ples that have lower AVA titers to be detected. 
The impact of immunogenicit y on PK, efficacy and safet y (including inject ion site react ions and 
infusio n related reacti ons) will be explored.

Kaplan -Meier estimates of Week 24 and Week 48 event rates presented.
13.1.7 Safety Analysis
Safety analysis will be performed using the Safet y Analysis Set. No statistical inference will be 
made for safe ty analyses.
The number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs (defined as any AEs, regardl ess of 
relationship to study  drug), AESIs (ie, serious infections including opportunistic infect ion such as 
PML, m alignancies , liver injury, infusio n reactions, injec tion si te reacti ons), and SAEs which 
occur on or after the first dose date and up to [ADDRESS_1095348] dose of the open -label

Maintenance Phase between the Week [ADDRESS_1095349] ings.
13.2 Interim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination
No interim analysis is planned.
13.3 Determination of Sample Size
Assuming a clinical remissio n rate of 42% f or vedolizumab and 16% for placebo at Week 52, a 
sample size of 94 subjects in the vedo lizumab SC group and 47 subjects in the placebo group will 
provi de 90% power at a 2 -sided 0.05 level o f significance. To ensure a randomized sample size o f 
188 subjects, assuming 47% of the subjects entering induction will achieve clinical response at 
Week 6, approximately  400 subjects will need to be enrolled into the study .

Stool frequency (b)
0 = Normal no. of stools for this patient
1 = 1 to 2 stools more than normal
2 = 3 to 4 stools more than normal
3 = 5 or more stools more than normal
Sub score, 0 to 3
Rectal bleeding (c)
0 = No blood seen 
1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time 
2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time 
3 = Blood alone passes 
Sub score, 0 to 3
Findings on endoscopy 
0 = Normal or inactive disease 
1 = Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern , mild friability)
2 = Moderate disease (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions)
3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)
Sub score, 0 to 3; 0 = Normal or inactive disease
Physician’s global assessment (d)
0 = Normal
1 = Mild disease
2 = Moderate disease
3 = Severe disease
Sub score, 0 to 3
(a) The Mayo score ranges from 0 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. Partial Mayo score excludes 
endoscopy and ranges from 0 9.
(b) Each patient serves as his or her own control to establish the degree of abnormality of the stool frequency.
(c) The daily bleeding score represents the most severe bleeding of the day.
(d) The physician’s global assessment acknowledges the 3 other criteria, the patient’s daily recoll ection of abdominal 
discomfort and general sense of well -being, and other observations, such as physical findings and the patient’s 
performance status.

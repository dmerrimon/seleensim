Version [ADDRESS_66518]-sepsis care recommendations target specific deficits experienced by [CONTACT_61741]; 
however, these recommendations are infrequently applied. Our STAR program implements 
evidence -based post -sepsis care recommendations, directed to high -risk sepsis survivors, and 
delivered using a proactive, nurse n avigation process demonstrated to reduce readmissions and 
costs. This project will evaluate if implementation of the STAR program within a large healthcare 
system will improve outcomes for high -risk sepsis patients and will generate knowledge of best 
pract ices for implementation and dissemination of post -sepsis transitions of care.  
The proposed research consists of 1) a pragmatic, stepped -wedge, cluster randomized 
controlled trial, 2) prospective economic evaluation, and 3) concurrent analyses of the 
implementation process.  
1) We will conduct a two -arm, pragmatic, stepped -wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial to 
test the effects of two post -sepsis care implementation strategies on clinical outcomes. At each 
four-month interval, one of eight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61712] 1) 
usual care (UC) consisting of current, standard peri - and post -discharge activities, to ARM 2) 
STAR program beginning during index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61713] 90 days after 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
2) Cost analysis will occur through a prospective economic evaluation that uses empi[INVESTIGATOR_61714], health utilization, and clinical outcomes from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42619]'s 
data warehouse as inputs to a Markov state transition model for f ormal cost -effectiveness 
analysis.

 3) The study's implementation will be guided by [CONTACT_61742]. A mixed methods evaluation framework will be used to inform future 
implementation and dissemination activities.

is large, and study procedures are embedded into the context of routine care. Patients are 
eligible if they present to the emergency department and are subsequently admitted under 
inpatient or observation status to a participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Specific inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are described.

 Inclusion Criteria : 
1. At least 18 years of age upon admission  
2. Oral/parenteral antibiotic or bacterial culture order within 24 hours of emergency department 
presentation  
a) culture drawn first, antibiotics ordered within 48 hours or  
b) antibiotics ordered first, culture ordered within 48 hours (adapted from criteria applied in 
development of the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock)  
3. Deemed as high -risk for death or [ADDRESS_66521] generation  
Exclusion Criteria : 
1. Antibiotic doses administered in the operating room will be excluded from eligibility 
determination as these administrations are likely to represent pre -operative infection prophylaxis 
and not presumed infection  
2. Patients transferred from other acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61717]  
3. Patients with a change in code status (i.e., do not resuscitate, do not intubate) within 24 hours 
after infection onset due to presumed limitation of aggressive treatment.  
4. Patient has not been randomized previously.  
Risk models include clinical and administrative data to produce a near -real time risk score that 
identifies cohorts at high risk for death and 90 -day readmission, delivering the information at the 
point of care. Risk models will run each morning and automa tically generate lists of eligible, 
high-risk patients admitted over the prior 72 hours. During the intervention phase at each facility 
Version 3

 (i.e., after transition from UC to STAR), the navigator will receive the list of admitted, high risk 
patients via secure email. Patients will only be identified as eligible for randomization once 
during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61718]. Patients assigned to the intervention will be contact[CONTACT_61743][INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
Randomization  
Eight participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61719] a staggered sequence (i.e., steps 1 to 8) of 
transitioning from UC to STAR group assignments using SAS Enterprise Guide v7.1 (Cary, NC). 
All eight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61720] a control period of varying len gth, dependent on timing of 
transition to the intervention arm. Every four months, one randomly assigned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61721]. 
All patients identified as eligible using the risk model will be allocated to the study ARM that 
matches the admitting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s assignment (STAR or UC). During the intervention phase at 
each facility (i.e., after transition from UC to STAR), the navigator will receive the list of 
admitted,  high risk patients via secure email.  
Study Procedures  
Patient identification : Each morning, the list of eligible, high -risk patients is automatically 
securely transmitted to the study database within REDCap and the study PIs are notified of 
completed transmission. The list of eligible, high risk patients at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61722] (based on randomly assigned months) will also be automatically emailed via 
secure transmission to the STAR navigators.  
Initial contact [CONTACT_61744] : After the patient list is generated, the STAR navigator will 
contact [CONTACT_61745] (e.g., bedside nurse, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8384]) to obtain permission to discuss the 
STAR program with patients assigned to STAR. At any time, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8384], bedside nurse, or 
Version 3

 patient may decline for the patient to participate in the STAR program or any components of 
usual care.  
Summary of STAR services duration : The STAR navigator will provide telephone - and EHR -
based support within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61723]. Within [ADDRESS_66522] -discharge follow -up. They will 
continue to receive STAR directed services for 90 days following their discharge. Subsequently, 
they will be transitioned back to the next appropria te care location.  
Detailed description of STAR services : At the initial contact [CONTACT_61746][INVESTIGATOR_059], the STAR navigator will introduce the STAR program and conduct health literacy 
screening and mental health screening using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -2, with 
reflex administration of PHQ -9 for positive PHQ -2 (i.e., > or = 3).130 The STAR navigator will 
convey results to the care team for appropriate behavioral health referrals. The STAR navigator 
will also confirm consultations wit h physical therapy (recommendations delivered to care team), 
antibiotic stewardship (i.e., a coordinated program that promotes appropriate antibiotic use) with 
additional infectious disease consult if ongoing Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome 
criteri a more than 48 hours after infection onset (i.e., abnormal body temperature, heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], white blood cell count), and palliative care team. For discharge, the STAR 
navigator will provide disease -specific education to the patient and careg iver and discharge 
education including what to expect during transition and a "playbook" with information on 
planned follow -ups. The navigator will also record all in -person and phone follow -up and all 
disciplines with post -acute touchpoints in the provide r discharge plan. Because communication 
of care gaps and recommendations can be difficult in the complex acute care environment, our 
group has conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_61724] [ADDRESS_66523]

 admitted; inpatient case managers for estimated discharge date, primary care provider 
information, and regular 24-48-hour contact [CONTACT_61747]; EHR -based messaging to 
providers; and post -acute care team within 24 hours of discharge (e.g., home health clinical 
supervisor) to initiate two -way communication.  
Irrespective of discharge location (e.g., home versus skilled nursing facility), the STAR 
navigator will provide monitoring through phone contact [CONTACT_10974], caregiver, or provider (as 
appropriate for post -acute care location) at <[ADDRESS_66524] -acute inte rval, the STAR navigator will maintain weekly telehealth 
touchpoints with patients who remain at high -risk for poor outcome (i.e., any previous positive 
screen, high -risk comorbid condition [e.g., chronic lung disease, heart failure], or low health 
literac y) and every third week touchpoints with patients considered low -risk after the immediate 
post-acute interval. These [ADDRESS_66525] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  
Statistical Analysis  
Sample Size Determination : This study is designed to detect a 20% relative reduction in 
composite [ADDRESS_66526] 
Version 3 
7-15-2022

 roughly 40% combined [ADDRESS_66527] 90%  power (α=0.05) to detect a 20% relative 
reduction in composite 90 -day mortality and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].  
Statistical Methods  
Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative, virtual nurse navigator 
implementation strategy to  improve post -sepsis care .  
All primary and secondary analyses will follow intention to treat approach, such that all 
patients meeting  identical criteria and randomized will be analyzed, regardless of adherence to 
intervention assignment. This  real-world approach will assess intervention effectiveness while 
limiting selection biases associated with  adherence. We will compare the two groups (STAR 
versus usual care) at baseline for age, sex, race, and  comorbidities to assess for balance 
inferred randomization.  The primary outcome is the composite of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61725] [ADDRESS_66528] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47850]. Because hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61726] a 
staggered sequence and the outcome varies at  the patient level, we will use a generalized linear 
mixed -effects model to compare the composite 90 -day mortality and readmission primary 
outcome measure between the intervention conditions, adjusting for  clustering effects across 
multiple levels (e.g., admitting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], implementation timing) to include hierarchical  data 
structures. The intervention fixed -effect coeffici ent will compare STAR versus UC conditions 
(i.e., UC as  reference). We will evaluate covariates for patient (e.g., sex, race, comorbidities, 
length of stay, discharge  disposition [skilled nursing facility, rehabilitation, home]) and 
organizational factors (e.g., admitting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  guideline adherence, urban versus rural setting, 
implementation timing) to identify any potential differences  between study arms. We will include 
covariates in model if unbalanced between STAR and UC groups. We will  also evaluate effect

 modification by [CONTACT_61748] (e.g., discharge  
disposition) and by [CONTACT_61749] (e.g., referrals).  
 
Secondary outcomes are described below and will be assessed using the same 
approach. That is, we will  construct generalized linear mixed -effects models, like for the primary 
outcome analysis, for individual  assessments of secondary outcomes and process measures. 
We will test different distribution parameters to  determine the optimal distribution family for each 
model and outcome variable (e.g., binomial, gamma  distributions).  
1. All -cause mortality. We will assess the individual mortality component of the primary 
composite endpoint  separately. We will construct generalized linear mixed -effects models with 
all-cause mortality as the  dependent variable, assessed as a binary outcome at [ADDRESS_66529]  coefficient will compare STAR 
versus UC conditions, using an intent -to-treat approach.  
5. Cause -specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715]. We will assess the cause -specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61727]  a) infection, b) chronic lung disease, c) heart failure, and d) acute 
kidney injury. We will construct separate  generalized linear mixed -effects models for each of the 
four cause -specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61728].  The dependent variable for each model will 
be infection -, chronic lung disease -, heart failure -, and acut e kidney injury -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5449], respectively, assessed as a bina ry outcome at [ADDRESS_66530] coefficient will compare STAR versus UC conditions,  using an intent -to-treat approach.  
9. Support service referrals. We will compare the receipt of support service referrals. 
Documented referrals  to a) rehabilitation services, b) speech therapy, and c) behavioral health 
will each be captured separately  from the electronic health record. We will construct separate 
generalized linear mixed -effects models with  documented referral to rehabilitation services, 
speech therapy, and behavioral health each as the dependent  variable of one model. Each 
variable will be assessed as a binary outcome at [ADDRESS_66531] modified intent -
to-treat analyses excluding  sepsis patients 1) who do not survive index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61729]; and 2) 
discharged against medical advice since providers do not have the  opportunity to deliver full 
care and prepare the patient for discharge. Based on published data and internal  estimates, we 
expect less than 10% of study patients will die during index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61730]  2% 
will be discharged against medical advice. We will present results from group comparisons as 
odds ratios and  95% confidence intervals.  
We do not anticipate substantial missing data because all outcomes are routinely 
collected variables and  utilization is broadly captured within the large integrated system. While 
utilization may occur outside of CHS,  this is not expected to be a major limitation because of 
CHS market share and accessibility. Specifically, CHS  operates three large hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61731], the only acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61732], Burke,  Cleveland, Lincoln, Stanly, 
and Union counties, where most of this study will be co nducted, and more than [ADDRESS_66532] treatment groups equally. Further, 
internal data  indicates nearly 75% of high -risk patients are Medicare -insured and have complete 
healthcare claims within  and outside CHS facilities captured through participation in the ACO 
managed by [CONTACT_61750]. We will leverage this data for subgroup analyses and to explore miss ing data 
patterns that can be adjusted using pattern -mixture methods in sensitivity analyses.

 All hypothesis tests  will be two sided and data will be analyzed using SAS Enterpris e 
Guide v7.1 (Cary, NC) or R v3.5 (Vienna,  Austria).  
Interim Analysis  
Interim analyses will be conducted when 50% of enrollment targets are met and [ADDRESS_66533] (a Steering  Committee representative, an independent clinician investigator, 
and an independent biostatistician), who will  make a recommendation on continuing the trial as 
planned or modified.  The following analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_61751]:  
1. Sample size re -estimation  
a. Drop -out rate for STAR: We define the drop-out rate for the STAR program to 
be the rate of  nonadherence to the intervention. Non -adherence is defined by [CONTACT_61752], were  discharged before contact [CONTACT_61753], and were not able 
to be contact[CONTACT_61754][INVESTIGATOR_47850]. The population is defined as all patients who 
were deemed eligible and identified as high  risk for readmission or mortality. We 
propose to assess the drop -out rate in the STAR intervention  arm when half of patients 
have 90 -day follow up information available (n= 2196). At that time, we will  re-estimate 
the sample size needed for the study using drop -out rates.  
b. Event rate: We propose to re -estimate the sample size based on the combined 
90-day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61733] (n=2196). We 
will base the re -estimation on the  original 20% relative reduction to determine if more 
patients are needed to maintain 90% power. We  will measure the composite outcome as 
defined for the primary effectiveness analysis, i.e., we will  capture all patients wi th either 
Version [ADDRESS_66534]  discharge as event -
positive.  
2. Interim efficacy analysis with 50% information (i.e., 50% of target accrual with 90 -day follow 
up data).  
We propose to conduct an interim effectiveness analysis of the primary outcome of 
composite 90 -day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61734] 50% of patients have been 
accrued and have 90 -day outcomes. We will use the Haybittle -Peto procedure with boundary of 
less than 0.001. No additional  interim analyses will be planned until the sample size re -
estimation and futility analyses are reviewed  and a recommendation is made to continue, stop, 
or modify the study.  
3. Futility analysis/conditional power at 50% complete data information (50% of target 
accrual with [ADDRESS_66535] a futility analysis at 50% information 
accrual for the trial. The  first futility analysis will be conducted at the same time as the sample 
size re -estimation based on the  drop-out rate. Conditional power is the probability of detecting a 
difference at the end of the study  (p<0.05) given the current data trend. We will estimate 
conditional power under the null hypot hesis of  no difference, the designed alternative of 20% 
relative reduction, and the current observed trend. A  recommendation would be made to stop 
the study for futility if the conditional power is less than 0.10  for the designed alternative.  
Aim 2: To assess the cost -effectiveness of virtual nurse navigator -driven STAR program  
Within -trial Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio.  
We will estimate Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio  (ICER) of STAR versus UC using 
data derived during the study interval as a measure of benefit to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61735]. We will 
estimate ICER as incremental costs divided by [CONTACT_61755]. The intervention group  beta 
weight from cost model will be divided by [CONTACT_61756]. 
Version [ADDRESS_66536] probabilistic sensitivity analysis to address uncertainty by [CONTACT_61757] 10 -15%.  
Subgroup Analyses: Reliance on CHS data warehouse for measuring healthcare use may miss 
costs incurred  in other health systems. We expect cross -system healthcare utilization to be 
similar between groups and low  overall due to the size and accessibility of CHS in the study 
region. However, we will repeat analyses within the  subgroup of patients enrolled in the ACO 
managed by [CONTACT_61750] (more than 140,000 lives covered in 2018). Within  this subset, we will have 
complete visibility of all healthcare claims within and  outside of CHS during the study  interval. 
Data from this group will be informative to health policy given the introduction of the CMS BPCI, 
a value -based alternative payment model to improve post -acute care for specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61736], including  sepsis. Subgroup analyses will also be performed by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_61737] (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577],  discharge disposition, comorbidities).  
Extrapolated Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio. We will build a Markov -type state -
transition simulation  model using TreeAge (TreeAge Software Inc.) to estimate ICER of 
receiving STAR. We will use data derived  during the study interval and other evidence -based 
sources to extrapolate cost -effectiveness analyses to 12  months after discharge. This analysis 
will be conducted to assess benefit from a societal perspective and  determine if the intervention 
costs associated with STAR are offset by [CONTACT_61758] (e.g., 
reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394]) and improvements in mortality. We will estimate the ICER as 
the incremental costs divided by [CONTACT_61759], including a 3% standard discount for 
costs and  outcomes. The intervention group beta weight from the cost model will be divided by 
[CONTACT_61760]. Sensitivity Analyses and Uncertainty: 
Model parameters will be sampled  from their appropriate distributions over [ADDRESS_66537] -effectiveness of STAR is sensitive to changes in  specific assumptions made to

 inform the baseline analysis. We will also estimate 95% confidence intervals  around ICER point 
estimates using probabilistic analyses and create acceptability curves comparing STAR  
favorability at various willingness to pay thresholds.  
The data analys es for Aim [ADDRESS_66538] which specifies the sharing 
of data under a limited data se t.  
Aim 3: To determine the key enablers, barriers, and contextual factors that contribute to 
the successful  implementation of the STAR program  
The goal of this mixed methods assessment is to identify perceived barriers to, and 
enablers of, implementing  the STAR program into the peri -discharge setting and feedback 
results to improve process. The Consolidated  Framework for Implementation Research will 
guide discovery and evaluation of implementation barriers and  enablers. Other outcomes will be 
assessed based on elements from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,  Implementation, and 
Maintenance (RE -AIM) model to quantify the reach and effectiveness of the STAR  program and 
its potential for dissemination and scalability.  
Our mixed -methods approach includes: a) semi -structured interviews conducted with 
administrative leaders  and providers during Pre -Implementation to assess organizational 
support, culture, and recommendations for  STAR implementation and then Post -implementation 
to plan future dissemination; b) navigator/provider  interviews and surveys during Implementation 
to assess inner setting, intervention, and individual factors; c)  patient/caregiver interviews and 
surveys during implementation phase (recruited from the  intervention arms) to  learn about their 
Version [ADDRESS_66539] on STAR  
recommendations; and d) focused ethnography of the navigator role in the program conducted 
on four work  days (two days for each navigator) at the three 8 -month intervals during 
implementation. Focused ethnography  is an innovative component of our study, selected to 
obtain a holistic and nuanced understanding of the  navigator’s role in the intervention.  Interview 
recordings and ethnographic observation fieldnotes will be  transcribed for coding and qualitative  
analysis using ATLAS.ti v8.0. We will perform content analysis using the constant comparison 
method, an  inductive grounded theory approach for developi[INVESTIGATOR_61738]. We will finalize  the code list and repeat data review using the 
finalized code structure for coding reliability.  Participant recruitment will be primarily facilitat ed 
through email survey invitation  in REDCap . Subject  identifiers , including email address,  will also 
be tracked  and captured  in REDCap.  
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PLAN  
Recruitment Plan  
Pragmatic Clinical Trial

models will run each  morning and automatically generate lists of eligible patients admitted over 
the prior [ADDRESS_66540] of actively admitted, high risk patients via 
secure email. Assignment to a study arm will be based on the  date the eligible patient is 
identified by [CONTACT_61761]. Pa tients will only be identified as eligible for  randomization once 
during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], regardless of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]. Patients with repeat

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
Mixed -methods process analyses  
A subset of patients randomized to receive the STAR program and providers and 
administrative leaders will be  recruited to provide interviews for analyses of STAR program 
implementation processes. For pre - and postimplementation data collection, we will recruit and 
interview [ADDRESS_66541] the  interviews.

4) Objectives    
Validate the utility  of sweat as a non -invasive sample for the pharmacological investigation of 
skin biology 
 
Specific Aim  1: Develop and Report Validated Protocols for the Collection and Quantification of 
Lipid Mediator Profiles in Sweat by [CONTACT_56620]:  
1) Comparison of pharmacological and physiological methods of sweat stimulation (i.e. comparing the lipid mediator profile of sweat collected following stimulation by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_631307])  
2) Site-specificity of sweat lipid mediator composition (i.e. comparing the lipid mediator profile 
of sweat collected from the volar forearm to sweat collected from the anterior distal thigh  
and/or lower back ) 
3) Inter - and intra- individual variability of the sweat mediator lipi[INVESTIGATOR_631308] 2 : Evaluating the impact of systemic cyclooxygenase inhibition  on the plasma and 
sweat mediator lipi[INVESTIGATOR_33771]    
 
5) Background  
Blood and urine represent common human biofluids that have been extensively studied in the context of pharmacokinetic and metabolomic analyses. However, the collection of these biofluids is either physically or culturally invasive and therefore subject compliance is sometimes difficult to achieve. The use of non- invasive matrices such as hair, oral fluid, sweat 
and tears has improved subject compliance in pharmacokinetic studies, and recently there has 
been interest in conducting metabolomic analyses usi ng sweat for the same reason. While sweat 
has been previously used to diagnose cystic fibrosis in neonates and infants and to detect illicit drugs in forensic settings, it has rarely been used in metabolomic analyses due to a lack of uniform sweat collection protocols that provide a reproducible and measureable volume of sweat . With advances in technology, the Macroduct® sweat collection system was developed 
and validated by [CONTACT_631321], Inc. for the reproducible collection of neonatal sweat for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. More recently, the Macroduct® system was used in a proof-of- principle study

 Page [ADDRESS_842524] of our knowledge, only a single study exists that examines the composition of sweat in the context of cutaneous disease, and this study 
demonstrated that subjects with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or hyp erhidrosis exhibited increased 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels relative to healthy control.   PGE2 is a member of a class of compounds known as bioactive lipid mediators, which regulate inflammatory and immune responses. These mediators, which include an ar ray of oxygenated 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (“oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]”), endocannabinoids and ceramides, are generally produced locally via a 
variety of biosynthetic pathways in response to extracellular stimuli and function similarly to 
local hormones or autacoids. Additionally, ceramide s play an important structural role in the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_214221]. Lipid mediators have been studied previously in cutaneous research, but have depended  on a limited number of analytical targets and/or focus ed on a single class of analytes, 
preventing the identification of mediator pathway cross-talk. Our laboratory has developed methods to quantify over [ADDRESS_842525]® sweat collection 
system  on the volar bilateral forearm of human subjects  (IRB #605131). However, little is known 
about the source of lipid mediators in sweat, the effects of different sweat stimulation techniques on lipid mediator composition as well as the site -specificity of the sweat mediator lipi[INVESTIGATOR_33771]. 
Collecting such baseline data is critical for the evaluation of routine mediator lipi[INVESTIGATOR_631309] a non -invasive tool to  support studies investigating cutaneous inflammatory 
responses, dietary manipulation, and skin diseases lacking biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

12) Procedures Involved  
 
Prior to enrollment in study  
All volunteers will be subjected to either an in -person interview at the WHNRC or to  a telephone 
interview during which their eligibility and willingness to participate in the study will be determined. Twelve subjects eligible and willing to participate will be enrolled in the study and 
scheduled to begin participation at least seven days after  enrollment.  
  
Study Design  and Visits  
Subjects will participate in four study visits, separ ated by [CONTACT_386787]. On each of the study 
days, participants will arrive in the morning after an overnight [ADDRESS_842528]  (ad lib water 
consumption will be allowed and encouraged). Collection procedures will be performed at approximately the same time of the day to avoid circadian effects. Subjects will also be asked to 
not apply any cream or medication to their body [ADDRESS_842529] 48 hours prior to each study visit . 
 
• Study Visit 1:  After obtaining written informed consent, s weat will be collected using the 
Macroduct® sweat collector from the volar forearm following stimulation of sweating by 
[CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_631311] . Following sweat 
collection, subjects will be given a 15 -minute break after which they will undergo up to 15-
minutes of light exercise on a stationary bicycle to stimulate sweat by [CONTACT_631327] 
(see below). Following the light exercise, sweat will be collected from the opposite volar 
forearm using the Macroduct® sweat collector.  The study visit is complete after the second 
sweat collection.  
 
• Study Visit 2:  Sweat will be collected using the Macroduct® sweat collector from the volar 
forearm and anterior distal thigh following stimulation of sweat by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_631312] . Collect ions will occur simultaneously at both 
sites.  The study visit is complete after both sweat collections.  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Investigating the stability, variability and mechanism of 
incorporation of lipid mediators into eccrine sweat  
 Page 6 of 12   • Study Visit 3:   Sweat will be collected using the Macroduct® sweat collector from both volar 
forearms  and the lower back  following stimulation of sweat by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_631313] . Collections will begin  at approximately 10 
minute intervals at all three  sites.  The study visit is complete after all three  sweat collections.   
 
• Study Visit 4:  A baseline sweat sample will be collected using the Macroduct® sweat 
collector from the volar forearm following stimulation of sweating by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_631314] . A blood sample (~ 6 mL) will 
be collected in EDTA -treated Vacutainer® tubes following venipuncture of the opposite 
antecubital vein. Following sweat and blood collection, subjects will consume [ADDRESS_842530]-ibuprofen consumption. Total blood drawn per participant over the course of the study will be ~ 24  mL.  Prior to Study Visit 4, participants  will undergo a video interview 
with the study physician (and co- PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966]) [CONTACT_631342], during which time [CONTACT_631343] will obtain a medical history from the subjects and review the risks and side effects of ibuprofen with the subjects.  
 Participants will remain fasted during study visits (ad lib water consumption will be allowed and encouraged). At the end of the study visit, subjects will be allowed access to the WHNRC dining 
room where snacks such as juice, granola bars, oatmeal, dried fruit, coffee, tea and hot cocoa will be made available for their consumption.  All blood and sweat samples collected will be measured  for metabolites derived from normal 
biological processes which  will include inflammatory mediators. Additionally, blood and sweat 
collected during visit 4 will also be used to measure ibuprofen levels at each collection time.  
 
Description of the “ light exercise”  
Sweat stimulation by [CONTACT_631328], such as riding a stationary bicycle with resistance, has been 
used in several recent studies to collect sweat for ionic analysis. In the proposed study, subjects 
will ride a  cycle ergometer (Monark ergometer)  with resistance for 10-15 minutes in a 
temperature and humidity monitored room. Resistance (in kg*m/min)  will be set so as to  elevate 
heart rate to that evinced during moderate (60-80% VO2max) steady state aerobic exercise and pedal cadence will be set using a metronome at  [ADDRESS_842531]® sweat collection system and the Webster Sweat Inducer  are FDA-approved 
medical devices routinely used for sweat collection in neonates and infants in order to diagnose cystic fibrosis . The protocols for these devices are well established and freely available at 
http://wescor.com/translations/Translations/M2551 -7A-EN.pdf . In brief, the collection site will 
be cleansed with a 70% solution of isopropanol followed by [CONTACT_631329], and sweating wi ll be

collector will then be attached to marked site and secured using a tourniquet or bandage to maximize cutaneous contact. The collection device will remain in place for up to 30 minutes after which it will be removed and the collected sweat will be exuded into a collection vial and 
stored until analysis. 
 
   
13) Data and Specimen Banking  
All banked specimens will be stored in -20 oC or -80 oC freezers.  Participants will be given the 
option to provide consent for future , undetermined use of their specimens by [CONTACT_631330] a signed consent document and a verbal  agree ment of ‘yes’  during the 
discussion of consent for participation at the enrollment visit.  Any archived blood or sweat samples of participants having provided the described consent may be used at a later date for 
purposes not specified by [CONTACT_15365].  All identifiable subject information will be removed except for assigned subject ID codes. If the subject does not agree to future use of specimens, all remaining  specimens  will be destroyed.   
 
14) Data Management and Confidentiality  
Identifiable information linked with the participant identification code will be stored separately 
from  any data collected during the study and will only be made accessible to the study Principal 
Investigators and the Coordinator.  Data will be collected on hard copy forms and computer-
based questionnaires using only the participant identification code.  Completed f orms will be 
kept in locked files at the WHNRC in rooms that are also locked.  Electronic files will be kept in 
folders on the WHNRC fileserver, which is password- protected  and will be limited to access for 
key study personnel only.  The WHNRC fileserver is located  behind a hardware firewall and is 
backed up off- site weekly , at a minimum. In the case that data needs to be stored on a laptop 
computer, the laptop will be encrypted.  Data entered manually will be double entered and compared to identify data entry errors.    
15) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
This study is an observational  study and involves an intervention with an FDA-approved over-
the-counter non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drug . The Co -Investigator for the study, [CONTACT_631344], will provide oversight for this part of the research and review the study participants’ 
medical history prior to prescribing the ibuprofen to each subject.  Neve rtheless, it does present 
several challenges and various methods of data collection t hat participants will be subject to.  In 
order to ensure the safety of participants during administration of challenges or specimen collection , all aspects of the study will be carried out by [CONTACT_7355].  The other 
collections involve non-invas ive minimal risk activities.   Participants will spend the study visit 
day in private rooms in the Metabolic Research Unit of the WHNRC containing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_631315].  A unit monitor will remain in the unit (but outside of the participant room) as a contact [CONTACT_631331], 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Investigating the stability, variability and mechanism of 
incorporation of lipid mediators into eccrine sweat  
 Page 8 of 12   concerns, questions, or emergencies arise throughout the visit .  Participants will never be left 
alone in the Metabolic Research Unit.  
 
The exercise- induced  sweat stimulation  (exercise bicycle) will be administered by a qualified 
physiologist and staff  who, prior to the test, will assess the subject’s risk level using the risk 
factors established by [CONTACT_25986]: a) family history o f premature 
heart disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], impaired fasting glucose, obesity, 
and sedentary lifestyle. Those subjects falling in the low and moderate risk categories will be further evaluated by [CONTACT_631332].  If the subject responds ‘yes’ to any of the questions, they will not
 perform the tes t. For those cleared for testing, heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure 
will be measured prior to administration of the challenge . During the test , participants will be 
asked to rate their level of perceived exertion, and if level reaches a level of ‘extremely hard’  or 
if the participant loses balance, becomes dizzy, or other adverse reaction occurs during the test , it 
will be stopped immediately .    
 Venipuncture blood draws will be conducted by [CONTACT_591395], trained and experienced phlebotomists. If excessive bruising or discomfort occurs, no further venipunctures will be conducted.  Sweat -stimulation by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_631316]. Subjects will be asked 
periodically during iontophoresis if the discomfort is unbearable. If the subject responds ‘yes’, the iontophoresis procedure will be stopped immediately.  If at any time a participant refuses to continue participation or refuses to participate in a particular aspect of the study, they will be excluded from all or part of the remaining procedures 
according to their wishes .  
 
16) Withdrawal of Subjects  
During the consent process, participants  will be informed that they can withdraw from the study 
at any time without any risk of repercussion or penalty.  Compensation for participant time in the 
study will be pro -rated to reflect the withdrawal time .  Specimens previously collected during the 
study will be used as specified.    
 
17) Risks to Subjects  
There is a small risk of loss of balance, dizziness, or shortness of breath that could result from 
the 3 0 min light exercise to stimulate sweat production  (exercise bicycle).  The use of an exercise 
bicycle is expected to result in increased heart rate and sweating  but may present additional risks 
to individuals in very poor cardiovascular health or with undiagnosed cardiovascular risk factors such as family history of heart disease, h ypertension, high cholesterol, type [ADDRESS_842533]. Potential 
cardiovascular -related serious adverse events include stroke and myocardial infarction, which 
could result in death.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Investigating the stability, variability and mechanism of 
incorporation of lipid mediators into eccrine sweat  
 Page [ADDRESS_842534] that the mask be readjusted or removed at any time.  
 
Sweat collection procedures pose minimal risks to the subjects as they are all noninvasive. The 
Webster Sweat Inducer  uses electricity for iontophoresis based i nduction of sweating. Physical 
risks of the sweat collection may include: 
• The use of the device will require pressing on the skin. If a subject bruises easily, they may 
develop a bruise at the location of the measurements although this would be unusual. 
• Iontophoretic induction of sweating using the Webster Sweat Inducer  may cause contact 
[CONTACT_631333][INVESTIGATOR_8826]. It is also possible, although 
unlikely, that the iontophoretic procedure may cause burns to the subject. The device manufacturer has estimated that the risk of burns to be [ADDRESS_842535] been 
cleared for sweat collection by [CONTACT_631334].  
• Iontophoresis may also cause minor discomfort to subjects in the form of slight stinging or 
prickling at the site of administration. However, the procedure has been approved by [CONTACT_631335] (~ 5 
min).  
 As the amount of ibuprofen provided (400 mg) is within the recommended over-the-counter dosage for this product, we do not anticipate any risks associated with administration of this drug. However, ibuprofen intake has been known to produce an upset stomach including nausea, bloating and gas; diarrhea; constipation; headaches; dizziness; nervousness; itching skin or a rash; blurred vision or ringing ears in certain individuals. Pri or to prescription of the ibuprofen, 
[CONTACT_631342] will review the participants’ medical history and inform them of of the risks and potential side effects associated with ibuprofen intake.  We will do our best to make sure that the personal information in the subjects’ study record will be kept private. However, no study can guarantee 100% protection of private information despi[INVESTIGATOR_631317]’s privacy. Subjects will be made aware of this during the consent process. 
 
18) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
There are no direct benefits to the participants.  Results f rom this study will benefit the scientific 
and medical  communit ies and provide information that may be used to develop non-invasive 
sampling methods to support future cutaneous research studies.

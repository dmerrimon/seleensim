Introduction: 
You are being asked to volunteer as a subject in a research study. Taking part in research is 
completely voluntary . This consent form provides you with the information you will need in order to 
consider whether you would like to participate in this study. 
 
The investigator of this study will explain the purpose of the study, including how the study will be 
carried out and what you will be expected to do.  The investigator will also explain the possible ri sks, 
possible benefits and alternatives of being in the study.  You should ask the investigator any questions 
you have about any of these things before you decide whether you wish to take part in the study.  If you 
decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to sign and date this consent form to indicate t hat 
you agree to participate.  This process is called informed consent. 
 
You are invited to participate in a research study.  Research is a way of gaining new knowledge.  A 
person who participates in a research study is called a “subject” rather than a patient. 
 
Why is this research study being done?  
The purpose of this research study is to investigate whether or not platelet rich plasma (PRP) ma y help 
to improve healing and decrease post operative pain in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament 
(ACL) reconstructive surgery using their own patellar tendon grafts.  PRP is a form of treatment that 
uses the patients own blood sample to enhance healing. Nearly 200,000 ACL surgeries using the patients  
own patellar tendon for reconstructions are performed annually, however, many of these patients suffer 
from postoperative pain located at the site of the patellar tendon graft.  
You are being asked to participate in this study because your injury and subsequent surgical treatment 
using your own patellar tendon as graft represents the patient type we believe stands to benefit from 
improved outcomes with the use of PRP.   
Why is this research? 
This is a research study because the application of PRP to patellar tendon graft harvest sites i s being 
compared to the standard procedure of patellar tendon graft harvest without the application of PRP.  The

 v This study will be “randomized” in order to achieve the best possible study results that will 
reflect only outcomes related to the PRP and not any bias on the part of those enrolling you in 
the study or performing the surgery.  You will be randomly selected to receive one of two 
possible treatments: ACL reconstruction with PRP applied to the graft harvest site or ACL 
reconstruction alone, without any PRP. By [CONTACT_172628], it ensures that you will 
be assigned to a group by [CONTACT_3364] (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin). You will have an equal chance of being 
in either group.  
v This study will be “double blinded” to order to achieve the best possible study results that will 
reflect only outcomes related to the PRP and not any bias on the part of those evaluating the 
study results. This means that neither you nor the investigators directly involved in the study 
procedures will be allowed to know whether or not you received any PRP or not during your 
surgery until the study is complete. The study is done this way because knowing whether you are 
in a group can change the results of the study.  We will not tell you which group you are in since 
the research study staff will not know your group either. However, we can quickly find out 
which group you are in if we ever need to know for your safety.  
 
 
Ø If you are randomized into the treatment arm of the study (selected to receive the PRP), a 
sample of blood totaling 10cc (less than one tablespoon) will be drawn by [CONTACT_172629]. This will occur in the operating room, 
after you have been anesthetized or “put to sleep.” This blood will be drawn using the IV line 
which will have been previously placed by [CONTACT_172630]. This means that you will not be subjected to any 
additional needle sticks nor will you be caused any additional discomfort from the blood 
draw by [CONTACT_4907].  
 
Ø If you are randomized into the control arm of the study (not selected to receive the PRP), you 
will not undergo a blood draw nor will you receive any treatment with the PRP. Neither you 
nor the investigators will know if you had a blood draw or received PRP. Therefore, the 
remaining study procedures will be the same for all individuals in the study.   
 
 
By [CONTACT_172631] 24 months. 
 
• At the beginning of each of your follow up visits, you will be asked to fill out brief 
questionnaires. These questionnaires will require approximately 10 minutes of your time 
to fill out. These questionnaires will ask you about the characteristic, severity, and 
location of any postoperative pain you may experience. They will also ask you to judge 
your function level after the surgery and compare that to your function levels prior to 
your injury. After your doctor gives you a physical, the study investigator will also 
perform a short physical that should take approximately 5 minutes.  
 
• At your 3 and 6 month follow up visits, imaging studies will be done in addition to your 
physical and questionnaires. D etails regarding these imaging procedures are included 
below:  
Version: 9/5/12 
IRB #: 12-160A          Page 4 of 10 
 
 o X-Ray imaging of the Knee: At your [ADDRESS_202163] of care for all patients that undergo ACL reconstruction, and not 
only those that choose to participate in this study. These x-rays will require an 
additional 15 minutes of your time during that visit. 
 
o Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Knee: At your [ADDRESS_202164] Nicholas’ office. This will be used to 
assess the effect, if any, that the PRP may have on the healing of the donor site. 
This MRI exam is unique to this study and would not be normally done as part of 
standard of care for your surgery. This imaging will require an additional 30 
minutes of your time during that visit.   
 
 Drugs and Devices used in this study:  
 
• The process of PRP preparation and administration will be as follows: Prior to the start of every 
surgery, the anesthesiologist will obtain an intravenous (IV) line to administer anesthesia for 
your surgery. Those patients randomized to undergo treatment with PRP will have approximately 
1 tablespoon worth of blood withdrawn. This will only be done on those patients who were 
enrolled in the study and randomized to the treatment group (group assigned to receive PRP).  
• Briefly, the blood sample is put through a series of filtering cycles by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_172626] a device 
called a centrifuge. This process helps to concentrate the PRP or platelet rich plasma,  which is a 
portion of your blood that contains the chemicals we are studying. After this has been prepared, 
we will apply it to your surgical wound at the end of the surgery. 
• The application of the PRP will be done at the very end of the surgery by a fellow or resident 
participating in the case, but not a study investigator. This will ensure that neither you nor any 
member of the research group will know whether you received PRP or not. The PRP sample that 
has been prepared will be placed into the portion of your patella bone that was used to harvest 
the graft (donor site). A small portion of the patellar tendon known as para-tenon will be used to 
hold the PRP sample in place (Para-tenon is a special name [CONTACT_172636]). It is standard procedure to sew the 
para-tenon back over the graft harvest site at the end of an ACL reconstruction.  If randomized to 
receive the PRP, the only thing we will be doing differently is laying the PRP sample down on 
the patellar bone before we close the para-tenon.  
• Since PRP is created from your own blood without the addition of any added chemicals or 
biochemical modification, it does not require FDA approval for its use. The machines that are 
used to spin the blood samples and help to create PRP are approved and regulated by [CONTACT_1622]. 
Our study will be performed using an “Arthrex” centrifuge to prepare our samples. This device 
has gained full FDA approval. More information on this can be found at:

What are the risks and discomforts of this research study? What could go wrong? 
 
Since this study is randomized, your group may receive less effective treatment or have more side 
effects than the other group. The potential risks and discomforts that you might experience while on this 
study are outlined below. 
 
Platelet Rich Plasma:   
Since PRP is a formulation created entirely from your own blood, the complications and risks are 
extremely low. The anesthesiologist who prepares the blood is highly skilled and will carefully ste rilize 
the skin prior to obtaining the sample.  
 
Another side effect that is common is an initial increase in pain and inflammation at the s ite where the 
PRP is injected. This occurs because the platelets and blood sample contain natural chemic als that 
stimulate the immune system. This type of complication is short lived and when it does occur, is t reated 
effectively with pain medication and anti-inflammatory medications, such as Ibuprofen. 
 
Please inform the investigator if you have a bleeding disorder or are on a medication known to thin the 
blood such as Coumadin or Lovenox. These participants have a higher risk of bleeding when compared 
with normal bleeding characteristics. 
 
Blood-Drawing:    
There are no major risks of having your blood drawn in this study. You will be fully anesthetized (in a 
clinically induced sleep) while the blood is drawn, which therefore eliminates the pain of the i njection. 
In addition, the blood will be drawn through the IV that is already being placed as part of your scheduled 
surgery. Therefore, you will not experience any additional bruising or discomfort as a result of 
participating in this study. 
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): 
 
Since MRI machines use magnets and radio waves to take images of the body, you are not subjected to 
any radiation. However, you might experience discomfort with having to lie on a narrow enclosed couch 
for 15 minutes as the machine takes the images. In addition, the machine produces loud tappi[INVESTIGATOR_172627] s 
that might cause you some discomfort. Earplugs will be provided to you to help reduce the noise. Also, 
some people with claustrophobia (fear of closed spaces) may find the MRI scanner too confining.   
 
It is very important that you tell the researcher about any metal objects, devices or implants that  are in or 
on your body before you enter the scanner room.  All metal objects must be removed before entering the 
magnet room. The MRI may cause any metal in or on your body to move. In some cases, having those 
devices may mean that you should not have an MRI scan.   
 
If the scan reveals a condition that could affect your health, you will be referred for the proper follow-up 
care to your primary care physician or another specialist.

 X-rays:  
As a result of the x-ray imaging, you will be exposed to radiation during the [ADDRESS_202165] ACL reconstruction surgery, you will not be 
exposed to any additional radiation by [CONTACT_4907].  While we cannot be sure any dose of 
radiation is completely safe, the amount you will be exposed to in this study is not known to cause 
health problems.  
 
Surveys :  
There are no risks associated with completing the survey. However, you might feel discomfort from 
completing the survey as a result of the questions being asked.   
 
Breach of Confidentiality:   
Although it is unlikely, there is a small risk that there can be a breach of confidentiality if pati ent 
information is disclosed to unauthorized individuals.  All measures to ensure patient confidentiali ty will 
be employed.  Data will be de-identified and entered into a password-protected computer only access ible 
to investigators on this study.  
 
Unknown Side Effects:  
As with any new procedure or treatment, there might be side effects that are unknown at this time. You 
will be closely watched for side effects.  You should report any unusual events to the study staff. 
 
Risks to Women of Childbearing Potential and Pregnant Women  
We do not know the effects of PRP on fertility or a fetus.  For this reason, if you believe you are 
pregnant or have a chance of becoming pregnant, you should not take part in this study. A urine 
pregnancy test will be performed prior to the start of study procedures.  If you are pregnant, you will not 
be allowed to be in the study.  If you become pregnant during the study, please notify the investigator 
immediately. The investigator might have to withdraw you from the study and closely monitor you 
through your entire pregnancy. 
 
The side effects of this experimental procedure on newborns are also not known; therefore, if you are 
currently breastfeeding you cannot be in this study. 
 
What are the benefits of this research study?  
If you are randomized to receive PRP in this study, you may directly benefit by [CONTACT_172632]. This may allow you to return to pre-injury activity leve ls 
faster than individuals that have the standard of care autologous bone patellar tendon bone 
reconstruction of their ACL. In addition, this study may provide knowledge on the benefits of PRP in 
graft site healing and patient satisfaction following ACL reconstruction. This information can then be  
used to change the standard treatment for patients requiring this surgery in the future.  
 
If you do not want to take part in this research study, what are your other choices?  
If you do not join this study, you have other choices for treatment. Talk to your doctor about your 
choices.   
Version: 9/5/12 
IRB #: 12-160A          Page 7 of 10 
 
 Possible choices may include: 
 
• Application of PRP to the graft harvest site without participation in the study; 
• Standard treatment – ACL reconstruction with autograft bone patellar tendon bone; 
• No surgical treatment, including physical therapy and plyometric training; or 
• Comfort care. 
 
Are there any costs for being in this research study?   
This research study is funded partially “Arthrex.” The remainder of the costs associated with thi s study 
will be incurred by [CONTACT_172633].” You will not have any added costs from being in this study. All study 
related visits, procedures and medications will be given to you at no cost. Neither you nor your 
insurance company will be billed for your participation in this research.  
 
The portion of the study that involves the preparation of the PRP is the portion of the study that will be 
funded partially by “Arthrex” as they have donated their centrifuge and other equipment (syringes) 
needed to prepare the PRP .

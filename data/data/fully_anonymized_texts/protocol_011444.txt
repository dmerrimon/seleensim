‘Intervent ion’ and ‘treatment’
‘Intervent ion’ is used generically in clinical studies to describe the intervent ion under 
evaluat ion (eg, medical device, pharmaceut ical product, physical or behavioral 
adjustm ent etc) . ‘Intervent ion’ is used in mo st sectio ns of this document forMEDI6570

‘Parti cipant’ and ‘subject’
‘Parti cipant’ is used generically to describe healthy  volunteers or patients taking part in a 
clinical study . ‘Parti cipant’ is used in most sections of this do cument; however, ‘subject’ 
is used in the statistical sect ions for consistency  with standard stati stical termino logy.

‘Nonsterilized male study 
participants should be advised to 
use a condom for all sexual 
intercourse with a female partner 
of childbearing poten tial from 
Day [ADDRESS_858641] dose. If the

paragraphs in the section was 
re-arranged to match the template.[COMPANY_008] has reassessed the 
theoretical risk to women of 
childbearing potential of exposure 
to semen from male participants 
receiving MEDI6570. The

from male participants exposed to 
MEDI6570 poses low to no risk to 
the fetus of pregnant sexual

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22of 131Overall Design :
This is a rando mized, double -blind ed, placebo -controlled, parallel -group , multicenter 
(approximately 70 to 100 ), internat ional study  in parti cipants who have recent ly (within the 
previous 30 to 365days) had a nMI (either ST segment elevat ion MIor non -ST segment 
elevation MI),with persistent inflammat ion (high sensi tivity C-react ive protein [ hs-CRP] 
≥ 1mg/L).Participants will be randomized in a 2:2:1:[ADDRESS_858656] ion 
volume of 1.5 mL)or  (in an inject ion volume of 4.0 mL) MEDI6570, or an
inject ion/volume-matched pl acebo, subcutaneously (SC), every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 32 weeks 
(9doses in total). Participants who were randomized to a study  intervent ion under Protocol 
Versi on1.0 or Am endment 1 (when there was also a  dose group) and were allocated a 
dosing vo lume of 0.5 mL will cont inue on their randomized study intervent ion (  
MEDI6570, or its inject ion/volume-matched placebo) to the end of the study , and the study  
blind will be maintained wit h regard to active versus placebo.
The rando mizat ion will be stratified by  [CONTACT_1617] (Asia, North America and Rest of 
World) and by  [CONTACT_641590] ( no,low-or moderate -intensit y statin 
therapy  vs high -intensity statin therapy). 
Parti cipants will undergo an echocardiogram and computed tom ography an giography ( CTA )
scan before randomizat ionand administration of study  intervent ion. During the fo llow-up 
period, parti cipants will also undergo an echocardiogram and CTA scan.
Disclosure Statement : Thi s is a parallel- group, treatm ent study  with 6intervent ion group s 
(including the legacy  mg dose group and matched placebo) that is parti cipant -and 
investigator -blinded.
Number of Participants: Approximately 400participants will be randomly  assigned to a 
study  interventi on,withan antici pated 369participants being rando mized toreceive active
study  interventi on (1 23participants in each of the 2 MEDI6570 group s),and 123participants 
being rando mized across the 3 placebo groups (ie, including participants already rando mized 
to the l egacy dose/v olume-matched placebo group for the  m g dose ). It is estimated that 
approximately 360evaluable participants (111evaluable participants in each of the 2 
MEDI6570 group s [  and mg],plus 27 evaluable participants in the legacy  mg 
MEDI6570 group, plus 111participants across the 3placebo groups )willcomplete the study .
Evaluable par ticipants are defined as those wi th an evaluable CTA at baseline and fo llow-up 
(Day  253; Visit 13).
Intervention Groups and Duration :The stud y intervent ion is MEDI 6570, a human
Immunoglobulin G1 l ambda (IgG1λ )triple m utation antibody that binds to  
 Going forward from Amendment 2, the
study  will include 4 intervent ion groups: and mg MEDI6570, and 2

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 24of 131Statistical methods for primary endpoint :The primary endpo int is change from baseline in 
NCPV MD. An analysis o f covari ance (ANCOVA) model on change fro m baseline adjusted for 
treatm ent group, baseline, and rando mizat ion strata will be used for the primary  analysis.
Statistical methods for secondary efficacy endpoints: Secondary endpo int of relative 
change from baseline in NT -proBNP will be analyzed with a mixed model wit h repeated 
measures analysis on change fro m baseline for the log -transform ed value of NT -proBNP. The 
resul ts will  be back -transformed to the original scale. The model will include fix ed effects of 
treatm ent group, visit, treatm ent group -by-visit int eracti on,and rando mization strata ,with 
baseline NT -proBNP as a covariate . Repeated measures for the model will be visit wit hin 
subjects ;an unstructured covariance structure will be used f or the repeated m easures. In case 
the model does not converge, back- up covari ance structures and other analysis solut ions will 
be detailed in the statistical analysis plan .
Secondary  endpoints that are measured by [CONTACT_641591], respectively . ANCOVA analyses similar to 
the primary  endpoint will be performed; the model will adjust for treatm ent group, respective 
baseline value , and rando mization strata .
Statis tical methods for safety variables: Type, inci dence, severit y, and rel ationship of 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events to study  intervent ion will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_641592]. Specific AEs 
will be counted once for each participant for calculating percentages. If the same AE occurs 
multiple times wit hin a participant , the highest severit y and level o f relationship to study  
intervent ion observed will be reported. Vital signs and safet y laboratory  data will be 
summarized descript ively at each time point by [CONTACT_336103].
Interim analysis: No formal interim analysis is planned. 
Ananalysis restricted to PK (serum MEDI6570 concentration)  
 
 Non -study  personnel who have no other 
involvement in the study  will perf orm this evaluat ion. These PKand PD data will be reviewed

2.2 Background
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_641557], CHD rem ains the l eading cause of mortalit y worldwide with a reco rded 
8930369deaths attributed to it in 2018. Of those deaths 2 110562 occurred in Europe (87 019 
in the U nited Kingdom  and [ZIP_CODE] in Sweden), 581 645 occurred in North Am erica (533 166 in 
the [LOCATION_002] and [ZIP_CODE] in Canada), 4929141 in Asia, 7285 11 in Africa, [ZIP_CODE] in 
Australia and 477308 in Lat in America and the Caribbean (BHF -CVD -Statistics 2019) . The 
economic burden is also substant ial with an est imated cost of $218.[ADDRESS_858680] of CAD ,the latter being defined as the presence of atherosclerosis in the 
coronary  arteri es. CAD can l ead to CHD in the form of stable angina, ACS, a syndrome of 
unstable angina , NSTEMI, and STEMI. 
Atherosclerosi s develops as a result of 2 interrelated primary mechanisms :lipid depos ition
and c oronary  inflamm ation (Ross 1999, Linton et al 2000 ). Pati ents wi th a pri or MI are at 
increased risk of MACE fro m atheroscl erosis, including CV death, MI, and stroke . Treatment 
with statins, which decrease low -densit y lipoprotein concentration, forms part of the current 
standard of care for patients with a prior MI. While statins decrease the residual lipid risk and 
partially decrease the inflammatory  risk in pat ients with a prior MI, a clinically significant risk 
of MACE rem ains, indicat ing a possible need to reconsider whether background statin use 
shoul d be mandated . CANTOS demonstrated that targeting the inflammatory  risk wi th 
canakinumab, a monoclonal ant ibody  against interleukin -1 β, reduces MACE compared with 
placebo (Ridker et al 2017 ).Natriuretic pept ides were not evaluated in this study; therefore, it 
is not known whether canakinumab affected natriuretic peptide levels. To the sponsor’ s
knowl edge, there are no plans to develop canakinumab for the CHD indicat ion.
Furtherm ore, i schemic CHD i s the m ost comm on cause of HF ( Crespo -Leiro et al 2016 ), a 
global epi[INVESTIGATOR_641558] >37.[ADDRESS_858681] e worl dwide ( Ziaeian and Fonarow 2016 ), with 
a proj ected 46% increase in the prevalence by [CONTACT_2892] 2030 (Savarese and Lund 2017 ). In 
Clinical Study Protocol - [ADDRESS_858682] on mortalit y and m orbidi ty (Crespo -Leiro et al 2016 ),HF 
accounts for 1% to 2% of the total healt hcare expendi ture in Europe and North America
(Cowi e et al 2014 ). Despi [INVESTIGATOR_641559] y of therapi [INVESTIGATOR_473670], there is a need for 
additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_641560].

anticipated to reduce the fo llowing in pat ients with a pri or MI, resi dual inflammat ion, and 
elevated NT -proBNP :
Reduce the lipid and inflammatory  risks that cause atherosclerosis, and thus reduce the 
incidence of MACE 
Reduce the inflammatory  risk and endothelial dysfunct ion that contribute to HF, and thus 
reduce the incidence of HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_641561] o f the chemistry , pharmaco logy, efficacy , and safet y ofMEDI6570 is

Potential Risk of Clinical 
SignificanceSummary of Data and/or 
Rationale for RiskMitigation Strategy
CTA scan Potential clinical consequences of 
undergoing a CTA scan include, as 
follows:
• Radiation exposure
• Reactions to iodinated 
contrast
• Renal impairment due to 
contrast administration
• Detection of incidental 
findings that may require 
assessment• R adiation reduction 
technologies, including 
prospective ECG -triggerin g 
and iterative reconstruct ion, 
allow CTA scan s tobe 
performed at low radiatio n 
doses ( Chen et al 2013 ,Hou 
et al 2014 , Meyersohn et al
2017 ,Schmermund et al
2017). Radiation reducing 
image acquisition techniques 
will be used (Section 8.1.1 )
and the ant icipated median 
(range) radiation exposure 
per CTA imaging time point
is 6 (3 -10) mSv .
• Risks of renal impairment 
will be minimized by 
[CONTACT_641594]
(Section 8.1.1).
• For each CTA scan, critical 
alert findings of clinical 
importance will be 
interpreted locally at the site 
to permit appropriate 
assessment and treatment 
(Section 8.1.1 ).

More extrem e inflammatory

elevated  levels. A recent study  dem onstrated that treatment with anti- inflammatory

levels during treatment predicted regression of non -calcified plaque burden (Dey et al
2020 ).  Given 
the preclinical and clinical data, MEDI6570 maydecrease the severi ty of atherosclerosis and 
HFand is a potential  future therapy  for the secondary  prevent ion of CV death, MI, stroke, HF, 
and revascu larizat ion. 
However, as the efficacy o f MEDI6570 in patients with a prior MI is y et to be determined, 
participants might receive limited or no efficacy benefits fro m participat ing in this study . 
Parti cipants might also benefit from receiving close monitoring and follow-up of their disease 
status post -MI.

Given the measures taken to minimize risk to participants enrolledin this study , the potenti al

4.0mL), subcutaneously (SC), every 4weeks (Q4W) for 32weeks ( 9doses in total). 
Approximately  400 participants will be randomly  assigned to a study  intervent ion,with an 
anticipated 369 participants being rando mized to receive active study  interventi on 
(123 participants in each of the 2 MEDI6570 groups), and 123 participants being ran domized 
across the 3 placebo groups (ie, including participants already rando mized to the legacy 
dose/volume -matched placebo group for the  mg dose). It is est imated that approximately 
360evaluable participants (111 evaluable participants in each of the 2 MEDI6570 groups 
[ and mg], plus 27 evaluable participants in the legacy mg MEDI6570 group, plus 
111 participants across the 3 placebo groups) will complete the study .The rando mizat ion will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_641596] c regi on(Asia, North Ameri ca and Rest of World )and by [CONTACT_641597] (no,low-or moderate -intensity statin therapy vs high-intensitystatin therapy ; 
refer to Appendix F) at baseline.
Parti cipants who were randomized to a study  intervent ion under Protocol Versio n1.0 or 
Amendment 1 (when there was also a mg dose group) and were allocated a dosing volume 
of0.5mL will continue on their rando mized study intervent ion (  mg MEDI6570, or its 
inject ion/volume-matched pl acebo) to the end of the study , and the study  blind will be 
maintained with regard to active versus placebo.
In accordance with the ESC/EAS and ACC/ AHA gui delines regarding lipid modificat ion and 
the reduction o f residual CV risk, the use of high -dose stati ns in secondary  prevent ion is a 
Class I recommendat ion with Level  A evidence to support it ( Mach et al 2020 ,Grundy  et al
2019 ). As such ,and in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_641563], the implementation and 
maintenance of the highest tolerated dose of statins (although not mandated) is strongly 
encouraged in this study  popul ation.
The study  will be conducted at approximately [ADDRESS_858688] on study  enrol lment; therefore, a more accurate estimation of the number 
of countri es and study  sites that ma y be included globally is challenging.
Parti cipants will be enr olled in the study  for up to approximately  12months, com prising a n 
optional, pre-screening period of up to 42 days (6 weeks), a screening and baseline imaging
period of  up to 42 day s (6weeks ), an intervent ion peri od of  225 days (31 to 32 weeks ), and a 
follow-up period of 100days (approximately 14weeks ; Figure 1). Following screening and 
confirmat ion of eligibilit y, parti cipants will underg o anechocardiogram and CTA sc an before 
rando mizat ion. The fi rst dose of study  intervent ionwill be administered on Day  1(Visit 3),

Johansson et al 2017 ). This increased ris k is partially  driven by  [CONTACT_641599] -infarct related vessels (Momiyama et al 2012 ,Park 2014 ,Kato et al 
2012 ),which may beco me more suscept ible to rupture due to the intense inflammatory  
response, a prerequisite for healing and scar formation triggered by [CONTACT_641600](Frangogiannis et 
al2002 ). Thi s post -infarct ion inflammatory process peaks within the first and second weeks 
post-ischemic event and resolves by  [CONTACT_641601] f ourth week ( Sun et al 2009 ). Moreover, 
evidence from clinical studies suggest sthat patients with persistent elevat ion of serum 
inflammatory  biomarkers [ADDRESS_858691] worse outcomes (d e Lem os et al 2007 ).
NCPV and total plaque vol ume have been shown to be significant predictors of cardiac events 
in ACS, wi th NCPV being a better predictor of a MACE than total plaque volume or calcium 
score (Kristensen et al 2011 ). These different components of coronary  atheroscl erosi s during 
CTA have been shown to be of incremental value for prognosticat ion (Radosavljevic -
Radovanovic et al 2016 ). 
In addit ion, NT -proBNP has been shown to be a strong predictor of future AEs in the post -MI 
popul ation(Lindahl et al 2005 ), being more reliable when measured in the relat ively stable 
phase (Kurtul et al 2016 ). Furthermore, the l evels of NT -proBNP were associated with the 
severit y and com plexi ty of the underlying CAD (Kurtul et al 2016 ).

Com pliment ing NT -proBNP for the evaluat ion of MEDI6570 in HF, LVEF and GLS will be 
secondary  endpoints in the study . Change in LVEF and change in GLS by  [CONTACT_641602] m baseline to Day  [ADDRESS_858694] -MI patients ( Multicente r Postinfarct ion Research Group 1983 ). In 
addition, changes in LVEF fo llowing MI are predictive of sudden cardiac arrest and death 
(Chew et al 2018 ). Furtherm ore, pharm acologic improvem ents in LVEF have been linked to 
decreases in mortalit y and HFhospi [INVESTIGATOR_36651] ( Breathett et al 2016 ,Kramer et al 2010 ). 
Improvem ents in LVEF can o ccur with ant i-inflammatory  therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. The CANTOS study  
demonstrated an improvement in the exercise capacit y (measured by [CONTACT_641603] ) and LVEF in a subgroup analysis ( Trankle et al 2018 ).LVEF will be calculated 
as the ratio of stroke volume divided by  [CONTACT_124702]-diastolic vo lume. 
Although LVEF isthe most extensively  used and investi gated assessment of l eft ventri cular 
funct ion, GLS is a new ,emerging technique that may  have a m ore si gnificant predi ctive value 
pertaining to outcomes in the HF populat ion when compared with LVEF (Kalam et al 2014 ). 
In a study  of 4172 pati ents wi th acute HF and varying degrees of LVEF, 1% improvement in 
GLS was associated with a 5% reduction in mortalit y risk irrespect ive of the ejection fraction
(Park et al 2018 ). Furtherm ore, i t has been shown that the reproducibilit y of GLS as a 
measurement of left ventri cular function surpasses that of LVEF,regardless of the level o f 
echocardiographic training (Karlsen et al2019 ).
Global Non -calcified Plaque Volume and Low Attenuat ion Plaque Volume
Two further measurements of plaque burden will be used in this study  as a secondary  
endpo int. NCPV i s the total  volume of  plaque in the coronary  arteri es that l acks calcificat ion. 
A subset of NCPV is LAPV.
Previous studies have shown increased NCPV and LAPV in patients with ACS when 
compared with patients with stable angina (Motoyama et al 2015 ,Dey et al  2014 ).This

comprehensively . Computed tomography angiography measurements of NCPV and LAPV are 
highly  reproducible (Andelius et al 2018 ).Change in NCPV and LAPV in the coronary 
arteri es will be measured fro m baseline to Day  [ADDRESS_858696], when studied in ACS, specifically non -STEMI, NCPV is a better predictor of 
MACE when co mpared withAgatston calcium score and total plaque vo lume (Kristensen et al
2011 ).  
 
 In studi es evaluat ing plaque regressio n with statin use, regressio n of both 
NCPV and LAPV have been observed. LAPV reducti on has been associated wi th decrease in 
CVevents (Andelius et al 2018 ). NCPV and LAPV will be measured in all vess els≥2 mm  in

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 59of 131Before the study  starts , the instructions for the RTSM will be provided to each site.
Re-allocation of participants to a dosing volume (Protocol Amendment 1): As a result of 
removing the  mg dose and introducing the mg dose in Amendment 1, a ll participants 
enrolled under Protocol Versi on 1.0were re-allocated to the appropriate dosing vo lume for 
their randomized intervent ion group under Amendment 1. Participants originally rando mized 
to the mg MEDI6570 group under Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_858717] ion/volume-matched placebo group s under Amendment 1.
6.3.[ADDRESS_858718] igator, and the site staff performing study- related procedures will all 
be blinded to the participant’s intervent ion group , with respect to active treatment versus 
placebo, to minimize bias.
The RTSM will provide to the invest igators or pharmacists the kit ident ification number to be 
allocated to the participant at the dispensing visit. Routines for this will be described in the 
RTSM user manual provided to each study  site.
The sponsor retains the rig ht to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected 
to be causally  related to the study  intervent ionand that potentially require expedited reporting 
to regulatory  authori ties. Rando mizat ion codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of 
data until all decisio ns on the evaluabilit y of the data from  each individual participant have 
been made and documented.
The RTSM will be program med wi th blind- breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, in 
which the knowledge of the specific blind ed study treatm ent will affect the immediate 
management of the participant’s condit ion, the investigator has the sole responsibilit y for 
determining whether unblinding of a participant’s intervent ion assignment is warranted. 
Parti cipant safety  must al ways be the first consideration in making such a determinat ion. If a 
participant’s intervent ion assignment is unblinded, the spo nsor must be notified within 
[ADDRESS_858719] document and report the action to the 
sponsor, without revealing the participant’s treatment to the sponsor’s staff.
Parti cipants enrolled under Protocol  Amendment 2 will be rando mly assigned to one of 4 
possible intervent ion groups in a 2:2:1:1 ratio:  mg (with an inject ion volume of 1.5 mL) 
or mg (with an inject ion volume of 4.0 mL) MEDI6570, or aninject ion/volume-matched 
placebo (1.5 or 4.0 mL). Invest igators will remain blinded to each participant’s assigned study 
intervent ion, with respect to active treatment versus placebo, throughout the course of the

[IP_ADDRESS] Timing of CTA Imaging Relative to Echocardiogram
If echocardiogram (Section 8.1.2 ) and CTA imaging are performed on the same day, 
echocardiogram imaging must always occur before CTA imaging, and before any addit ional 
beta-blocker administration above the daily dose used by [CONTACT_2299] , to avoid large doses 
of a beta-blocker affect ing echocardiogram measurements. This only  applies to abeta-blocker 
given for the purposes of heart r ate control for coronary  CTA. Parti cipants shoul d cont inue

For the pre -randomizat ion peri od, CTA imaging requirements are included in the inclusion 
criteria (Secti on 5.1). 
For the fo llow

1Using creat inine samples for the calculat ions, eGFR must be ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73m2(within 
30 day s beforethe CTA scan ).Sites are permitted to test for an addit ional creat inine 
(local or central ), if needed for the purposes of CTA imaging.
2No known allergy to iodinated con trast or known history  of contrast -induced 
nephropathy .
3No history  of coronary  by[CONTACT_641610] .
4No active arr hythmia including atrial fibrillat ionoratrial flutter on the day  of CTA 
imaging that would likely interfere with qualit y of CTA imaging. Parti cipants can return 
for CTA imaging on another day , if necessary.
5No c ontraindication to nitroglycerin.
6Not have r apid heart rate that i s uncontrolled by  [CONTACT_641611] .
7Parti cipants who have any condit ion that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the investigator, would 
increase the risk associated with having CTA imaging (eg, clinically significant renal 
disease) will not undergo CTA imaging.
[IP_ADDRESS] Radiation Exposure from CTA Imaging, Including Rules for Repeating CTA 
Scans 
The overarching principle for CTA imaging will be to maximize high -qualit y CTA imaging 
for endpo int ascertainment while minimizing radia tion exposure to participants. 
The ant icipated m edian (range) radiat ion exposure per CTA imaging time point is 
6(3-10)mSv. A maximum cumulat ive radiat ion exposure of [ADDRESS_858723] using a 
K(conversio n) factor of 0.014. Dose -saving image acquisit ion techniques will be used where 
applicable. 
The baseline and fo llow-up CTA scans may be repeated under certain circumstances . 
In order to ensure that the overall radiation exposure remains wit hin the specified limit, rules 
for CTA scans are detailed by [CONTACT_641612] :
1Baseline CTA (Day  -30 to -1; Visit 2 ):
(a)If the baseline CTA scan is obtained but randomization does not occur within the 
prespecified screening window, there is a 30-day window to repeat screening and 
proceed wi th rando mizat ion using the init ial baseline CTA. If repeat screening

echocardiogram imaging. If echocardiogram and CTA imaging are performed on the same 
day, echocardi ogram imaging must always occur beforeCTA imaging, and before any 
additional beta-blocker is administered above the daily  dose used by  [CONTACT_271147].
Imaging personnel and equipment will undergo certification by  a separate, blinded, 
independent core laboratory . Echocardiography will be perform ed at time points specified in 
the SoA (Secti on 1.3).
Planned measurements include , as f ollows:
Left Ventricular Ejection Fract ion
Left Ven tricular GLS

All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_641614] ,reported in response to an 
open question fro m the study  site staff (ie, Have you had any healt h probl ems since the 
previous visit/y ou were previ ously  asked ?), or reveal ed by  [CONTACT_16037],will be co llected and 
recorded in the eCRF . When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is prefe rred (when 
possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms . However, if a diagnosis is known and 
there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis 
and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
In addi tion,the recording of CV events (in this study to include CV death, MI, stroke, 
coronary  revascularizat ion, and heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]) are important efficacy  measures 
in CV clinical trials. All CV events will be recorded as AEs to allow for furthe r 
characteri zation. Alt hough this study  will not be powered for these endpoints, the study  will 
explore the effect of MEDI6570 on these important parameters .

the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated labor atory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion. Wherever possible ,the reporting invest igator
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg,anemia versus low hemoglobin value) . In 
the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, c linically relevant deteriorations in non -mandated 
param eters shoul d be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related to the disease under study .
8.3.6 Hy’s Law
Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry  may requi re further 
evaluat ion and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TBL ≥2xULN m ay need

Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
B [ADDRESS_858752] a 
causal relat ionship with this treatm ent.An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign ( eg, an abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom ( eg,nausea, chest pain), or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a medi cinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product . 
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of a pre -exist ing medical occurrence . An AE m ay occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study intervent ion has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of Serious Adverse Event
AnSAEis an AE occurring during any study phase ( ie,run-in, treatment, washout, follow -up) 
that fulfi lls one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -partici pant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_641571] 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
Is an Important Medical Event that may jeopardi ze the participant or may  requi re medical 
treatm ent to prevent o ne of the outcom es listed above
AEs for malignant tumo rsreported during a study  should generally be assessed as serious 
AEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medi cal Event’ cri terion shoul d be 
used. In certain situations, however, medi cal judgment on an individual event basis should be 
applied to clarify that the malignant tumor event should be assessed and reported as a 
non-serious AE. For example, if the tumo r is included as medical history  and progressi on 
occurs duri ng the study , but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumor, the AE may  not fulfillthe attributes for being assessed as serious, al though 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumoras an AE is valid and should occur. Also, 
some ty pes of  malignant tumors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], may be assessed as non-serious; examples in adult s include 
Stage 1 basal cell carcino ma and S tage 1A1 cervical cancer remove d via cone biopsy .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 88of 131Life-threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
participant ’s death . ‘Life -threateni ng’ does not m ean that ,had an AE occurred in a more 
severe form ,it might have caused death ( eg,hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96698] a serious AE, although the reason s 
for it may be ( eg,bronchospa sm, laryngeal  edema) . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the participant was enrolled in the study , provi ded that i tdid not deteriorate in 
an unexpected way  during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment
Medical and scientific judg ment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where Important Medi cal Events may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], disabili ty or incapacit y but may jeopard izethe participant or may 
requi re medical treatm ent to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of seri ous. 
These should usually be cons idered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_641572] ; 
medical judg ment must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_499501] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias ( eg,neutropenia or an emia requiring blood transfusio n, etc) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Intensity Rating Scale
mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities)
severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs . Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_73010] B 2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious . For example, nausea that persists for

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 89of 131several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a nSAE unless i t meets the cri teria 
shown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a nSAE when i t satisfies the cri teria 
shown in Appendix B 2.
B 3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y,consider the fo llowing factors when deciding 
whether there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by  [CONTACT_641621].
Time Course . Exposure to study  intervent ion. Has the participant actually received the 
study  interventi on? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the study  interventi on?
Consistency wit h known drug profile . Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the study  intervent ion(pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or intervent ions of 
the sam e pharmacol ogical class? Or coul d the AE be ant icipated fro m its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience . Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_122570]?
No al ternative cause . The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_33154], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence. Did the AE re -occur if the study  intervent ionwas reintroduced
after having been stopped? The sponsor would not normally reco mmend or support a re-
challenge .
Laboratory  tests . A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogn ized feature of overdose of the study intervent ion?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case . The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the availabl e data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment . Wit h no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relat ionship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’ .
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to lack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 90of 131B 4 Study Intervention Error
For the purposes of this clinical study ,a study  intervent ion error i s an unintended failure or 
mistake in the process for administering astudy interven tionthat either causes harm to the 
participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant . 
A study  intervent ion error i s not l ack of  efficacy of the study  interventi on, but rather a human 
or process related failure while the study  intervent ion is in the control  of the study  site staff or 
participant.
Study  intervent ion error includes situat ions where an error :
occurred
was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
did not occur, but circumstances wer e recogni zedthat coul d have l ed to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as study  intervent ion errors:
Study  intervent ion name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error ,eg, study intervent ion prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  
given to the participant
Study  intervent ion not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site 
of administrati on
Study  intervent ion not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be 
taken as a solid tablet 
Study  intervent ion not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
Wrong participant received the study  interventi on (excluding RTSM errors)
Wrong study  intervent ion administered to participant (excluding RTSM errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as study  interventi on errors in clinical 
studi es:
Errors related to or resulting fro m RTSM -including those which lead to one of the 
events listed above that woul d otherwi se have been a study  intervent ion error 
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed study  intervent ion dose(s) eg, forgot to take study 
intervent ion
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant f ailed to return unused study  intervent ion or em pty packaging
Study  intervent ion error s are not regarded as AEs, but AEs m ay occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.

participants while in storage at the cent eruntil shipment or di sposal  (where appropri ate) and 
records relevant processing informat ion related to the samples while at site.
The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and during use unt il 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward 
shipment or disposal.
The sponsor or delegated representatives will keep oversig ht of the ent ire lifecycle through 
internal  procedures, m onitoring of study  sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual 
requi rements of external laboratory  provi ders
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the sponsor’s assigned bio banks or other 
sample archive facilit ies and will be tracked by  [CONTACT_641622] t he remainder 
of the sam ple life cycle.
If requi red, the sponsor will ensure that remaining bio logical  samples are returned to the si te 
according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner.
C 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples 
If a parti cipant wi thdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical  samples, the samples will 
be disposed of/destroy ed/repatriated, and the action documented. If samples have already been 
analy zed,the sponsor is not obliged to destroy the results of th e research.
Following wi thdrawal  of consent for bi ological samples, further study  partici pation shoul d be 
considered in relat ion to the wi thdrawal  processes outlined in the informed consent.
The invest igator:
Ensures participant’s withdrawal of informed conse nt to the use of donated samples is 
highlighted immediately to the sponsor or del egate
Ensures that relevant human bio logical samples from  that parti cipant, if stored at the 
study  site, are i dentified immediately , disposed of appropriate ly, and that the action is 
docum ented
Ensures that the participant and the sponsor are informed about the sample disposal

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 94of 131Collection of Samples for Genetic Research
The blood sample for this genetic research will be obtained fro m the participant s at Day 1 , 
Visit 3 (before dosing) . Although DNA is stable, early  sample collecti on is preferred to avoid 
introducing bias through excluding participant s who may wit hdraw due to an AE . If for any  
reason the sample is not drawn at Day 1, Visit [ADDRESS_858757] 
study  visit. Only one sample should be co llected per participant for genet ics during the study.
Coding and Storage of DNA Samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are 
important to maintain participant confident iality. Sam ples will  be stored for a m aximum  
of 15years fro m the date of l ast participant last visit, af ter whi ch they  will be destroy ed. 
DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses . Sam ples will  be stored and used 
until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached.
An addit ional second code will be assigned to t he sample eit her before or at the time of 
DNA extraction replacing the informat ion on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will 
be ident ifiable only by [CONTACT_33160], unique number . Thi s number i s used to i dentify  the 
sample and corresponding data at the sponsor’s genet ics laboratori es, or at the designated 
organi zation. No personal details ident ifying the individual will be available to any  person 
(sponsor employee or designated organi zations working with the DNA).
The link between the participant enrol lment/randomi zation code and the second number 
will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at sponsor or 
designated organi zations. The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for 
analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical  data, all ow regulatory  
audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent.
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the stu dy, including this genet ics 
research component, are outlined in Appendix A.
Informed Consent
The genetic component of this study  is opti onal and the participant may part icipate in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in this genet ic co mponent . To participate 
in the genet ic co mponent of the study ,the participant must sign and date both the consent 
form for the m ain study  and the add endum for the Geno mics Init iative component of the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 95of 131Participant Data Protection
The sponsor will not provide individual genotype r esults to participant s, any  insurance 
company, any emplo yer, thei r family members, or general physician unless required to do 
so by  [CONTACT_2371].
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being 
linked to the ident ity of the participant . In except ional circumstances, however, certain 
individuals might see both the genet ic data and the personal ident ifiers of a participant . 
For example, in the case of a medical emergency , a sponsor physician or an invest igator 
might know a partic ipant ’s ident ity and also have access to his or her genet ic data . 
Regulatory  authori ties may requi re access to the relevant files, though the participant ’s 
medical informat ion and the genet ic files would remain physically separate.
Data Management
Any gen etic data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system by [CONTACT_641623]/or designated organizations to analyze the sampl es.
The sponsor and its designated organi zations may share summary results (such as genet ic 
differences fro m groups of in dividuals with a disease) fro m this genetic research with 
other researchers, such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], academic organi zations or health insurance 
companies . This can be done by [CONTACT_103472], where they can 
be co mbined with the resul ts of similar studi es to l earn even more about health and

Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemi stry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
E 1 Introduction
This appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report Potenti al Hy’s Law cases and Hy’s Law cases . It is not intended to be a comprehensive 
guide to the management of e levated liver biochemistries. 
Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalit ies can be found in Sect ion 8.3.6 .
During the study  the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry . The 
investi gator is responsible for determining whether a participant meets potential Potenti al 
Hy’s Law criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of Potenti al Hy’s Law and 
Hy’s Law events; thi s includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other visi ts 
including central and all local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  
visits; for example, Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria coul d be m et by  [CONTACT_96724] a 
central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL fro m a local laboratory . 
The invest igator will also review AEdata (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations 
in liver bio chemistry ) for possible Potenti al Hy’s Law events.
The invest igator participates, together with the sponsor’s clinical  proj ect representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria to agree whether Hy ’s 
Law criteria are m et. HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the 
elevations in liver biochemistry  other than DILI caused by [CONTACT_33159].
The invest igator is responsible for recording data pertaining to Potential H y’s Law /Hy’s Law 
cases and for reporting SAEs and AEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment 
in line wit h standard safety  reporting processes.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 97of 131For Potential Hy’s Law and Hy’s Law, the elevation in transaminases must precede or be 
coincident with ( ie,on the same day ) the el evation in TBL, but the re is no specified t imeframe 
within which the elevat ions in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E 3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of Potenti al Hy’s Law, it is important to perform a comprehensive 
review of laboratory  data for any  participant who meets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion 
criteria in iso lation or in co mbinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3x ULN
AST ≥ 3x ULN
TBL ≥ 2x ULN
Central Laboratories Being Used :
When a participant meets any of the Potenti al Hy’s Law ident ification criteria, in iso lation or 
in combinat ion, the central laboratory  will immediately send an alert to the invest igator (also 
sent to the sponsor’s representative). 
The invest igator will also rema in vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the Potential 
Hy’s Law ident ificat ion criteria are met ;where this is the case ,the invest igator will:
Notify  the sponsor’s representative .
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_122647] .
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  eCRF module(s) wi th the ori ginal  local 
laboratory  test resul t.
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts,the 
investigator will wit hout delay:
Determine whether the participant meets Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria ( refer to
Appendix E 2for definit ion) by [CONTACT_641624] y reports fro m all previous visit s 
(including both central and local laboratory  resul ts).
Local Laboratories Being Used :
The invest igator will wit hout delay  review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
Notify  the sponsor’s representative .
Determine whether the participant meets Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria ( refer to
Appendix E 2for definit ion) by [CONTACT_641625] m all previous visit s.
Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  eCRF .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 98of 131E 4 Follow -up
E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the participant does not meet Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria the invest igator will:
Inform  the sponsor’s representative that the participant has not m et Potential Hy’s Law 
criteria.
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the CSP.
E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the participant does m eet Potential Hy’s Law criteri a the invest igator will:
Determine whether Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria were m et at any  study  visit beforestarting 
study  treatm ent (refer to Section 8.3.6 ).
Notify  the sponsor’s representative who will then inform the central Study  Team  
Within 1 day of Potential  Hy’s Law criteria being met, the invest igator will report the 
case as an SAE of Pot ential Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘Important Medical Event’ and 
causalit y assessment ‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
For participant s that met Potential Hy’s Law criteria before starting the study  
intervent ion, the investigator is not requi red to submit a Potenti al Hy’s Law SAE unless 
there is a significant change1in the participant ’s condit ion.
The Study  Physician contacts the investigator to provi de gui dance, di scuss ,and agree on 
an approach for the study  participant s’ follow-up (including any  further l aboratory  
testing) and the continuous review of data
After this contact ,the invest igator will:
Moni tor the participant until liver bio chemistry  param eters and appropri ate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Complete fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the etio logy of the event and perform diagnostic i nvesti gations as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician. This includes deciding which ofthe tests 
available in the Hy’s Law lab ki t shoul d be used.
Com plete the 3 Liver eCRF Modules a s informat ion beco mes available.
                                               
1A ‘significant’ change in the participant’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the 
individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically 
relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whe ther there has been a significant change will 
be at the discretion of the investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any 
uncertainty .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 99of 131E 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this section shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where Potenti al Hy’s Law 
criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the invest igator to review available data and agree on whether there is an 
alternat ive explanat ion for meeting Potenti al Hy’s Law criteria other than DILI caused by [CONTACT_33155] , to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorit ies wit hin 
15calendar days from  date Potential Hy’s Law criteria was met . The sponsor’s Global 
Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safet y Physician will also be invo lved in this review 
together with other subject matter experts as appropriate . 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the invest igator will follow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternat ive explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subseq uently whether the AE meets the criteria for a nSAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the sponsor’s standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the invest igational product :
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to the sponsor’s standard 
processes. 
 The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply

Protocol Amendment History
The Protocol  Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment is located 
directly before the Table of Contents.
Amendment 1 (10Mar2021)
This amendment is considered to be substant ial based on the cri teria set forth in Art icle 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council o f the European Unio n.
Overall Rationale for the Amendment: 
to change the dose strength in the high dose group fro m  to m g MEDI6570 to 
achieve full  suppressi on in a majority of parti cipants
to modify  the participant popul ation to wi den eligibilit y to the study  by [CONTACT_641637]-infarction eligibilit y window, reducing the thresho ld for hs-CRP, and not requiring 
all parti cipants to have elevated NT -proBNP at baseline
In addi tion, the fo llowing other substantial changes were made: to minimize the theoretical 
risk of bleeding events; to minimize the number of injections required; to introduce an 
optional pre-screening visit ; to provi de guidance on conduct ing the study during the 
COVID- 19 pandemic; to clarify permitted and prohibited conco mitant m edicat ions; to clarify  
that parti cipants who di scont inue invest igational product because of an AE may remain in the 
study; and to remo ve the requirement that a participant who develops ADAs should be 
followed up until the value returns to baseline. All of the changes and their rationale are 
summarized below.

• Deletion of ‘Multiple studies 
have suggested various cut -
off points for the upper limit 
of a clinically meaningful 
value of NT -proBN P 
(McCullough and Kluger 
2018). Both the FDA and the 
European Society of 
Cardiology have proposed an 
exclusion cut -off of 
<125pg/mL (McCullough 
and Kluger 2018); as such, 
this was the threshold that 
was selected. This allows for 
the investigation of the 
efficacy of MEDI6570 in a 
populatio n with a wide range 
of NT -proBNP and 
corresponding degrees of

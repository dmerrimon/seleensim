2.1 Background and Rationale
Why This Study Is Being Conducted
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory, pruritic, chronic or chronically relapsing skin disease.  The 
adult phase of AD begins at puberty and frequently continues into adulthood.  In adults, disease typi[INVESTIGATOR_110924], face, neck, upper arms and back, and dorsal surfaces of the hands and feet.
1,2
Management of AD primarily consists of trigger avoidance, careful attention to skin care, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment.
3  The 2006 PRACTALL Consensus Report recommends 
treatment by [CONTACT_110975] a stepwise fashion based on disease severity, starting with topi[INVESTIGATOR_110925]/or a topi[INVESTIGATOR_110926], severe disease.
4  Systemic immunomodulatory agents used to treat AD include 
cyclosporin A, azathioprine, methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate mofetil, interferon gamma, systemic corticosteroids, and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin (IL)-[ADDRESS_123590] for AD is supported by [CONTACT_110976]-inflammatory cytokines that 
signal via JAK pathways in the pathogenesis of AD.  The activation of JAK signaling initiates expression of 
survival factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellular trafficking and cell proliferation, which contribute to AD and other inflammatory disorders.
8,9
Upadacitinib is an oral, reversible JAK1 selective inhibitor.  JAK1 inhibition blocks the signaling of many important pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-15, which are known contributors to inflammatory disorders.  Through modulation of these proinflammatory cytokine pathways, upadacitinib offers the potential for effective treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders such as AD, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), and Giant Cell Arteritis.  In the upadacitinib Phase 2 AD study, a statistically significant difference in the mean percent change from Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score at Week 16 (primary endpoint) was observed for 7.5 mg (–39.4%; P= 0.032 vs 
placebo), 15 mg (–61.7%; P< 0.001 vs placebo), and 30 mg (–74.4%; P< 0.001 vs placebo) groups 
compared with placebo (–23.0%).  Through Week 16 (Period 1), the percentages of subjects with 
adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), severe AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were 
similar across treatment groups.  There were no deaths reported during Period 1.
Additionally, upadacitinib was studied in rheumatoid arthritis with the results of two Phase 2 studies 
and two Phase 3 studies available as peer-reviewed manuscripts.
10-13  Results from the Phase 2 study in 
AD showed that upadacitinib doses of 15 mg and 30 mg per day had an efficacy and safety profile that 
can benefit patients with moderate to severe AD.

Based on the differentiated selectivity profile for JAK1 inhibition, upadacitinib could demonstrate an 
improved benefit-risk profile compared to other therapeutic strategies for patients with inflammatory diseases.
Upadacitinib is expected to provide better efficacy compared to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110927].
Additional information regarding indications under study can be found in the current edition of the 
upadacitinib Investigator's Brochure.
[ADDRESS_123591] common adverse events (AEs) of topi[INVESTIGATOR_110928], acne, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and striae.  Common AEs associated with use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_110929], burning, itching, or stinging at the application site.
2,15  When 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_110930], systemic therapy or phototherapy are generally added to topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450].

Treatment guidelines developed by [CONTACT_110977][INVESTIGATOR_110931]/or phototherapy do not adequately control the signs and symptoms of disease.
5,[ADDRESS_123592] to firmly recommend optimal dosing, duration of therapy, and precise monitoring protocols for any systemic immunomodulating medication.  Importantly, in addition to the lack of well-controlled efficacy data supporting their use in moderate to severe AD, the duration of use of many traditional systemic immunomodulatory agents are limited due to cumulative toxicity.
5,16
More recently, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in adults in the European Union (EU)
17and [LOCATION_002] 
(US)18in 2017.  Although dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110932], 
a large unmet need still exists in this population since, in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110933] 3 studies (even when combined with topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] [TCS]), fewer than 40% of patients achieved 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale; therefore, 60% or more of patients continued to experience significant symptoms on dupi[INVESTIGATOR_81228].
6,7  Nearly 50% of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110934] [ADDRESS_123593] common AEs are injection site reaction, conjunctivitis, and blepharitis.5,16
At this time very few systemic agents are approved for AD and, of those, cyclosporin A and oral prednisone are not suitable for long-term use.
5,16  Thus, there is a high unmet need for a significant 
number of patients with an inadequate response to currently available agents.  While not approved for 
AD, other systemic treatments may also be utilized including methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and
azathioprine.5,16
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123594] 
common AEs associated with use of cyclosporin are abnormal renal function tests (e.g., increased 
creatinine or proteinuria), hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, headache, and hypertrichosis.5,[ADDRESS_123595] 
common AEs associated with methotrexate use are gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., stomatitis, oral 
ulcers, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea) and abnormal liver function tests (e.g., increased aspartate transaminase [AST] or increased alanine transaminase [ALT]).
5,[ADDRESS_123596] common AEs 
associated with use of mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine are gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], bloating, anorexia) and occasional leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
5,[ADDRESS_123597] renal and/or liver function.
5,16  Rarely, lymphoproliferative 
disorders, lymphoma, and other malignancies are associated with these agents.5,16  Thus, there is a high 
unmet need for a significant number of patients with an inadequate response to currently available agents.
Upadacitinib is a novel selective orally available JAK1 inhibitor with the potential to decrease Th2 
mediated skin inflammation and itch while having minimal inhibitory effects on JAK2 and JAK3.  This could potentially minimize some of the reported safety concerns with non-selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be mediated by [CONTACT_110978]2 and JAK3 signaling pathways.
19,20
Primary results from the ongoing Phase 2 study demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an acceptable safety profile at the selected doses for Phase 3 (15 mg and 30 mg once daily [QD]) compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD.  Taken together, the efficacy and safety data from 
the Phase [ADDRESS_123598] been reported in 
the RA clinical studies for upadacitinib.  Based on the integrated data from the Phase 3 RA studies, there were comparable incidence rates of malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) between the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups with long-term treatment.  NMSC is a common malignancy in the general population.  Although the incidence rate of NMSC was higher in the upadacitinib 30 mg group compared to the upadacitinib 15 mg group in the integrated analysis data, the risk of patients experiencing a NMSC when receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg in the Phase 3 RA studies did not appear to increase over time.  Based on review of the data available, no pattern of the types of malignancies was noted, the malignancies are expected for a population of patients with 
moderately to severely active RA, and the standardized incidence rate is within the expected range for 
the general population.  The safety profile specific to upadacitinib is evolving, with safety results to date consistent with those known to be associated with JAK inhibition, with non-serious infections (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_110935]) being the most commonly reported AEs.  In addition, laboratory changes observed with upadacitinib include elevations of serum transaminases, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], creatinine, and creatine phosphokinase; both increased and reduced hemoglobin, depending on Baseline inflammatory burden; and reductions in white blood cell counts, including natural killer (NK) cells.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The results of all genetic toxicology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic; however, 
upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in 
females of childbearing potential.  Based on the calculated safety margins for human fetal exposure with 
seminal fluid transfer, there is judged to be no risk to the pregnancy of female partners of male subjects who are treated with upadacitinib.
A detailed discussion of the pre-clinical and clinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology, and safety 
experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure.

Taken together, the safety and efficacy data from upadacitinib studies to date show a favorable benefit-
risk profile for upadacitinib and support the continued investigation of upadacitinib in patients with 
various autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.

3.6 Biomarker Samples
Optional biospecimens (e.g., blood, serum, plasma, and skin biopsies) will be collected at specified time points ( Appendix D ) throughout the study to evaluate known and/or novel disease-related or drug-
related biomarkers.  Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and/or metabolites.  This research may be exploratory in nature and the results may not be included with the clinical study report.
The analyses of optional biomarker samples may include but are not limited to genetic markers that will 
help to understand the subject's disease and response to upadacitinib.  Genes of interest may include those associated with pharmacokinetics (drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins), genes within the target pathway (JAK, Tyk2, TNF), or other genes believed to be related to AD and other inflammatory diseases (Filaggrin [FLG], Claudin 1 [CLDN1], Human Leukocyte Antigen [HLA]).  Research may also include epi[INVESTIGATOR_110937]'s response to treatment or disease.  Samples for RNA and proteomics will be used to research if any genetic variants result in changes to gene expression or protein concentrations.  For any samples collected in [LOCATION_013], the research will be restricted to upadacitinib and AD.
4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator-controlled multicenter study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110938] ( ≥ 18 to 
≤75 years of age) with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy.  Eligible 
subjects must have a documented history of inadequate response to treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_110939] M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123604] injection for subjects 
who do not enroll into the open-label study.
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms as shown 
below:
!Treatment A (N = 325):  Daily oral doses of upadacitinib 30 mg from the Baseline visit until the 
Week 24 visit, and placebo pre-filled syringe administered at the baseline visit (2 subcutaneous 
[SC] injections), followed by [CONTACT_110980]-filled syringe (1 injection) every other week until the Week 22 visit.
!Treatment B (N = 325):  Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 600 mg (2 × 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110940]) administered at the Baseline visit, followed by [CONTACT_24983][INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg SC injection every other week until the Week 22 visit and daily oral doses of placebo tablets from the Baseline visit until the Week 24 visit.
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_22789] (moderate validated Investigator Global Assessment for atopic dermatitis [vIGA-AD 3] vs. severe [vIGA-AD 4]) and age (< 40, ≥ 40 to < 65, 
≥65 years).  The subject's age at baseline will be used for randomization and throughout the duration of 
the study.
Information on the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee 
(CAC) is described in Section 6.3.
The schematic of the study is shown in Figure [ADDRESS_123605] completed the Week 24 visit; the Primary Analysis will be performed based on this database lock, which is the only and final analysis for efficacy.  A final database lock will be performed at the end of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].the Phase 2 study that evaluated upadacitinib treatment for AD demonstrated superior efficacy of 
upadacitinib with an acceptable safety profile at the selected dose (30 mg QD) compared to placebo in 
subjects with moderate to severe AD.  Therefore, this subject population is considered appropriate for 
treatment and for evaluating a treatment difference between upadacitinib and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].
Selection of Doses in the Study
This study will evaluate upadacitinib (30 mg QD).  The selection of this dose was informed by [CONTACT_110981] 16-week safety, efficacy, and exposure-response data of the Period 1 of the Phase 2 AD 
Study M16-048, which evaluated 3 doses of upadacitinib (7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg QD) versus placebo.  
In addition, all of the currently available pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy data from upadacitinib studies were used to support the selection of these doses.
Study M16-048 Period 1 results demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an acceptable 
safety profile at the selected dose (30 mg QD) compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD.  A statistically significant difference in the mean percent change from Baseline in EASI score at Week 16 (primary endpoint) was observed for 7.5 mg (–39.4%; P= 0.032 vs placebo), 15 mg (–61.7%; 
P< 0.001 vs placebo), and 30 mg (–74.4%; P< 0.001 vs placebo) groups compared with placebo 
(–23.0%).  Through Week 16 (Period 1), the percentages of subjects with AEs, SAEs, severe AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were similar across treatment groups.  There were no deaths reported during Period 1.  Preliminary exposure-response analyses for Period 1 of the Phase 2b study show that the percentage of subjects achieving EASI 75, EASI 90, or IGA 0/[ADDRESS_123607] comparison.
In summary, exposures associated with upadacitinib 30 mg QD using the once-daily formulation are 
predicted to be efficacious in treatment of subjects with moderate to severe AD with limited effects on laboratory parameters.

contact[CONTACT_110984] (TA MD) and provide a recommendation.
Vaccines
Vaccines recommended by [CONTACT_110985].  If the investigator chooses to administer a vaccine, this should be completed before first dose of study drug with appropriate precautions and time interval.  It is recommended that subjects be up to date for recommended 
inactivated, toxoid or biosynthetic vaccines, such as injectable flu vaccine, pneumococcal, and pertussis 
(Tdap).  It is recommended that the live herpes zoster vaccine should be considered for administration at least [ADDRESS_123619] injection.  If the herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered, and there is no known history of primary varicella (chicken pox), pre-existing immunity to varicella should be confirmed with antibody testing at or prior to screening and prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine.  If screening varicella antibody testing is negative the herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered.  See Prohibited Medications/Therapy for a list of commonly used live vaccines that are prohibited during study participation.
Administration of inactivated (non-live) vaccines is permitted prior to or during the study according to 
local practice guidelines.  Examples of common vaccines that are inactivated, toxoid, or biosynthetic include, but are not limited to:  injectable influenza vaccine, pneumococcal, Shingrix (zoster vaccine, recombinant, adjuvanted), and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines.
Required Concomitant Medications
Beginning at the screening visit, twice daily use of an additive-free, bland emollient is required for at least 7 days prior to Baseline and for the duration of the study.
Note:  Subject may use prescription moisturizers or moisturizers containing ceramide, urea, filaggrin 
degradation products or hyaluronic acid if such moisturizers were initiated before the screening visit.
Rescue Therapy
Rescue treatment for AD may be provided, if medically necessary at the discretion of the investigator.
Investigators should attempt to limit the first step of rescue therapy to topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910], and escalate 
to systemic medications only for those subjects who do not respond adequately after at least [ADDRESS_123620] needs rescue treatment with a systemic agent (including but not limited to corticosteroids, 
cyclosporine, methotrexate [MTX], mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine) or phototherapy, study drug 
should be permanently discontinued prior to the initiation of rescue systemic agent or phototherapy.
Subjects who permanently discontinue study drug are encouraged to continue to participate in the
study (no study drug given) and complete the schedule of study visits and assessments.
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123621] efficacy and safety assessments (e.g., disease severity scores, safety labs) 
before administering any rescue treatment.  An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose if necessary.
5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects and Discontinuation of Study
Subjects may withdraw from the study completely (withdrawal of informed consent) for any reason at any time.  Subjects who discontinue the study prematurely after randomization will not be replaced.  Subjects may discontinue study drug treatment but may choose to continue to participate in the study.  A subject who discontinues one treatment (injection or tablet) will be discontinued from the other treatment (tablet or injection).
Subjects can request to be discontinued from participating in the study at any time for any reason 
including, but not limited to, disease progression or lack of response to treatment.  The investigator may discontinue any subject's participation at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, disease 
progression, lack of response to treatment, an AE, safety concerns, or failure to comply with the 
protocol.  Refer to Section 6.2for additional discontinuation criteria relating to Toxicity Management of 
serious infections, gastrointestinal perforation, cardiovascular and thromboembolic events, malignancy, ECG abnormality, and select laboratory abnormalities.
Subjects will have study drug discontinued immediately if any of the following occur:
!Rescue treatment is administered outside of the parameters described in Section 5.4(Rescue 
Therapy).
!Initiation of any systemic rescue therapy for AD.
!Permanent discontinuation from study drug will be mandatory after Week [ADDRESS_123622] with 
an EASI score worsening of 25% or more compared with their Baseline EASI score at any 2 consecutive scheduled study visits after Week 4 (after a trial of rescue treatment, if appropriate; see Rescue Therapy in Section 5.4).  For example, permanent study drug 
discontinuation would apply at Week 8 if EASI score worsening criteria are met at Week 4 and Week 8 without rescue therapy given at Week 4.  Permanent study drug discontinuation would apply at Week 12 if EASI score worsening criteria are met at Week 8 and Week 12 with rescue therapy given at Week 4.  This rule applies similarly to later timepoints.
!Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic or local reaction to study drug injection.
!Abnormal laboratory results or AEs that neither meet the criteria for discontinuation of study drug, as stated in Section 6.2or determined by [CONTACT_110986].
!The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
!The subject requests withdrawal from the study.
!Eligibility criteria violation was noted after the subject started study drug, when continuation of the study drug would place the subject at risk as determined by [CONTACT_110987].
!Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continuation of the study drug would place the subject at risk, as determined by [CONTACT_110987].

adults OR a change of QT interval corrected (QTc) interval > 60 msec from baseline.
!Confirmed diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or non-cardiac, non-neurologic arterial thrombosis.
The study will be discontinued or terminated in case of an unacceptable risk, any relevant toxicity, or a negative change in the risk:benefit assessment.  This might include the occurrence of AEs with a character, severity, or frequency that is new in comparison to the existing risk profile.  In addition, any data deriving from other clinical trials or toxicological studies that negatively influence the risk:benefit assessment may cause discontinuation or termination of the study.
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site.  The investigator may 
also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns.  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety reasons, [COMPANY_013] will promptly notify the investigator.

information on the subject's final status.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_123623]'s source documentation.
5.[ADDRESS_123624] Withdrawal from Study
Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation
In order to minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment or study participation should complete a Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit).  All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug or study participation.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug but continue study participation should complete a PD 
visit as soon as possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_123625] no longer wants to provide assessments (withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study drug, a second PD visit is not required.  The End-
End-of-Treatment Follow-up visit is not applicable for subjects who discontinued study drug and

Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent)
If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_123627] been resolved.
Biomarker Research:
In the event a subject withdraws consent from the clinical study, biomarker research will continue unless the subject explicitly requests analysis to be stopped.  When [COMPANY_013] is informed that samples are withdrawn from research, samples will not be analyzed, no new biomarker analysis data will be 
collected for the withdrawn subject or added to the existing data or database(s).  Data generated for 
biomarker research before subject withdrawal of consent will remain part of the study results.

Upadacitinib and placebo tablets will be dispensed to subjects beginning at baseline (Day 1) and as 
specified in Appendix D .  The first dose of study drug will be administered after all other baseline (Day 1) 
procedures are completed.  At the visits specified, the site personnel will review returned study drug kits and empty study drug packaging to verify compliance.
Each site will be responsible for maintaining drug accountability records including product description, 
manufacturer, and lot numbers for all non-investigational products dispensed by [CONTACT_779].
Study Drug Administration
Upadacitinib or placebo tablets will be taken orally once daily beginning on Day 1 (Baseline) and should be taken at approximately the same time each day.  The study drug can be taken with or without food.  
If a subject should forget to take upadacitinib or placebo tablet dose at their regularly scheduled dosing 
time, they should take the forgotten dose as soon as they remember as long as it is at least 10 hours before their next scheduled dose.  Otherwise they should take the next dose at the next scheduled dosing time.  Upadacitinib and placebo tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed, or dissolved.
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110956]-filled syringe will be administered by [CONTACT_110989] 1 and 
every other week at the study visits specified in Appendix D until Week 22.
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123629] will be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empty) to the study site personnel at 
each study visit.  The study site personnel will document compliance.
For allowed study drug interruption due to elective and emergency surgeries, the following rules apply:
1. If the subject must undergo emergency surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at the 
time of the surgery.  After emergency surgery, allow re-introduction of study drug once the 
physician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection.
2. Elective surgery, and interruption of study drug for such a surgery, will not be allowed during 
the study.
5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_110990].  For subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_110991].  The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group 
assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_66771].
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups:
!Treatment A:  Upadacitinib 30 mg + placebo pre-filled syringe (N = 325)
!Treatment B:  Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg + placebo tablets (N = 325)
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_22789] (moderate [vIGA-AD 3] vs. severe 
[vIGA-AD 4]) and age (< 40, ≥ 40 to 65, ≥  65 years).
Blinding
All [COMPANY_013] personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial, with the 
exception of [COMPANY_013] Drug Supply Management Team, will remain blinded until the Week [ADDRESS_123630]'s treatment throughout the study.  To maintain the blind, the upadacitinib tablets and placebo tablets provided for the study will be identical in appearance.  In addition, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110954]-filled syringe and placebo pre-filled syringe will be administered to the subjects at the investigative site.  Both types of pre-filled syringes will be provided in identical cartons.  The cartons are sealed with tamper-evident seals.  The study site personnel must not break the seals and open the cartons throughout the conduct of the study.  The investigator will designate an unblinded administrator to administer the injection to the subject.  The designated unblinded administrator must not have involvement with any other study-related activities.
To maintain the blind for the study, only the designated unblinded administrator will be allowed to 
break the tamper-evident seals of the cartons just prior to administration.  If a kit of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]/placebo is dispensed by [CONTACT_12067], it should remain sealed until the time of drug administration.  If for any reason the 
study drug administration is not performed, the carton should remain sealed, and should be accounted 
and prepared for destruction without breaking the tamper evident seal, maintaining the blind of the study.  Other study site personnel, including safety and efficacy evaluators, must not be involved with 
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123631].
Empty cartons without the syringe should be retained along with the unopened cartons for 
accountability.  If the carton with the syringe has been opened (the tamper-evident seal broken) and the unblinded administrator is not able to administer study drug syringe for any reason, then the administrator must document the kit number and a reason(s) for not administering a specific kit.  The unblinded administrator will immediately discard the syringe in an appropriate container after documenting accountability of such kit and prior to removing the barrier between administrator and the subject.
Other site personnel besides an unblinded administrator will not be made aware of the subject 
treatment assignments except in the event of an emergency where identification of the study drug is required for therapeutic measures.  The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a medical emergency.
In the event of a medical situation that requires unblinding of the study drug assignment, the 
investigator is requested to contact [CONTACT_110992].  However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary which warrants breaking the blind prior to contact[CONTACT_110993], the investigator can directly access the IRT system to break the blind without [COMPANY_013] 
notification or agreement.  Unblinding is available in the IRT system via the Unblinded Subject transaction, which is available only to the investigator.  If the IRT system is unavailable, unblinding may occur by [CONTACT_110994] (preferred) or email ([EMAIL_2197]).  For country-specific phone numbers, please see the following website:  http://www.endpointclinical.com/helpdesk/.
In the event that the blind is broken before notification to the [COMPANY_013] TA MD, the [COMPANY_013] TA MD should 
be notified within [ADDRESS_123632] be conveyed to [COMPANY_013] and recorded on appropriate eCRF.
Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol.
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110955]-filled syringe dosing will be recorded on the designated eCRF.  Subjects will 
be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empty) to the study site personnel at each clinic visit.  The study site personnel will document compliance in the study source documents, and the accountability of the Study Drug/Placebo will be recorded in IRT.
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123633] to study subjects.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified), the investigator is responsible for notifying independent ethics committee (IEC)/independent review board (IRB), regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].
5.[ADDRESS_123634] Information and Informed Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject or any medications being discontinued by [CONTACT_17204], the informed consent statement will be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_17205], the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the 
subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in 
the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding benefits for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
Optional biomarker research samples will only be collected if the subject has voluntarily signed and 
dated a written consent form describing the exploratory research.  The written consent may be part of the main consent form.  If the subject does not consent to providing optional samples, the subject will still be allowed to participate in the study.
Screening and Re-Screening Procedures
Within 35 days prior to the Baseline Visit, subjects will receive a full explanation of the study design and study procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the screening procedures outlined in Operations Manual Section 2.1.  With the exception of the QuantiFERON TB-Gold and purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) tests (Tuberculosis Testing/Tuberculosis Prophylaxis below), otherwise exclusionary laboratory values can be re-tested once during the Screening Period.  If the re-tested laboratory value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a screen failure.  Redrawing samples if previous samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since previous result was never obtained.
Subjects who initially screen-fail for the study are permitted to re-screen once following re-consent.  For 
additional re-screening, [COMPANY_013] TA MD or TA SD approval is required.  As appropriate, sites are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_26275]/SD to confirm if subjects should or should not be re-screened.  All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be repeated during re-screening.

Medical History
A complete non-AD medical history, including demographics, history of tobacco, alcohol, and nicotine use, will be taken at Screening.  Additionally, a list of each subject's specific AD-related medical history should be recorded at Screening.  History of clinical herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history.
The subject's medical history will be updated prior to study drug administration at the Study Day [ADDRESS_123637] to TB risk factors will be documented in the study source 
documentation.  This information will include Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, cohabitation with individuals who have had TB, and travel to, reside in, or work in TB endemic locations.

Adverse Event Assessment
The subjects will undergo physical examination for any active AEs and AEs that have occurred and 
resolved since the last visit as well as be interviewed for AEs that are not apparent in a physical examination.  SAEs and protocol related nonserious AEs that occur after a subject signs the informed consent will be collected, prior to the first dose of study drug.  Please refer to Section 6.1.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Subjects will complete the self-administered patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument (when allowed per local regulatory guidelines).  Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide 
interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Subjects who 
are functionally unable to read any of the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaire to them.  Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all specified visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items.
Subjects will complete the following questionnaires (described below) as specified in Operations Manual 
Section 2.1:  Worst Pruritus NRS; ADerm-IS; Head and Neck - Patient Global Impression of Severity (HN-PGIS), and Oral vs Injectable Questionnaire (only for the [LOCATION_002]).  The subject should complete the questionnaires before site personnel perform any clinical assessments and preferably before any interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing the subject's response.
A validated translation will be provided in their local language, as applicable.  All PROs are collected 
electronically.
For the Worst Pruritus NRS, ADerm-IS, and HN-PGIS, the PRO instrument should be completed prior to 
drug administration on Day 1.  All PRO instruments should be completed prior to any discussion of adverse events or any review of laboratory findings.
Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)
The Worst Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool that subjects use to report the intensity of their pruritus during a daily recall period.  Subjects are asked the question:  "On a scale of [ADDRESS_123639] 24 hours?"  The Worst Pruritus NRS will be administered daily from Screening through Week 16 using an electronic hand-held device that will be given to subjects to take home at Screening.  Hand-held device usage ends at the Week 16 visit (subjects should provide their response on the site's tablet at the Week 16 study visit).  Starting at the Week [ADDRESS_123640] 
Pruritis NRS is pending Phase 3 data.
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123641] Scale (ADerm-IS)
The ADerm-IS is a 10-item PRO questionnaire designed to assess a variety of impacts that subjects 
experience from their AD across both a 24-hour recall period (the daily items 1 to 3) and 7-day recall 
period (the weekly items 4 to 10).  Daily items are related to sleep, and include difficulty falling asleep, 
impact on sleep, and waking at night.  Weekly items include household activities (e.g., washing dishes, sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], doing laundry), physical activities (e.g., walking, exercising), social activities, concentration, self-consciousness, embarrassment, and sadness.  All items of the ADerm-IS are scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (no impact) to 10 (extreme impact).
The ADerm-IS will be administered on electronic hand held devices from Screening through Baseline; 
devices will be given to subjects to take home at Screening.
Head and Neck Patient Global Impression of Severity (HN-PGIS)
The HN-PGIS asks subjects to describe the severity of their head and neck AD symptoms right now.  
Subjects rate their head and neck AD symptoms on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 = Absent (no 
symptoms) to 6 = Very Severe (cannot be ignored and markedly limits my daily activities).  The HN-PGIS will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study.
Oral vs Injectable Questionnaire (only in the [LOCATION_002])
The Oral vs Injectable Questionnaire is an assessment tool designed to assess subject preferences 
regarding route of administration (oral QD vs injection Q2 weeks) for medications for AD.  The 
Questionnaire is administered at Week [ADDRESS_123642] be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, physician's assistant, or physician).  Any assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained to perform assessments and that all training is documented.  If the primary assessor is not available, the pre-identified back-up assessor should perform such assessments.
Validated Investigator's Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD)
The vIGA-AD is a validated assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally, based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)
The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72.  Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and

(absent) through "3" (severe).  In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage 
by [CONTACT_12904], trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6.  In each 
body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%).
Body Surface Area Involvement of Atopic Dermatitis (BSA, %)
A qualified investigator or designee should select the subject's right or left hand as the measuring 
device.  For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits will be assumed 
to be approximately equivalent to 1%.  Measurement of the total area of involvement by [CONTACT_110996].  The site should make every attempt to have the same qualified investigator or designee perform all BSA assessments on a given subject throughout the study.
Vaccines
Vaccines recommended by [CONTACT_110985].  If the investigator chooses to administer a vaccine, this should be completed before first dose of study drug with appropriate precautions and time interval.  It is recommended that subjects be up to date for recommended inactivated, toxoid or biosynthetic vaccines, such as injectable flu vaccine, pneumococcal, and Tdap.  It is recommended that the live herpes zoster vaccine should be considered for administration at least [ADDRESS_123643] injection.  If the herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered, and there is no known history of primary varicella (chicken pox), pre-existing immunity to varicella should be confirmed with antibody testing at or prior to 
screening and prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine.  If screening varicella antibody 
testing is negative the herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered.  See Prohibited Medications/Therapy for a list of commonly used live vaccines that are prohibited during study participation.
See Section 5.3(Prohibited Medications and Therapy) for a list of commonly used live vaccines that are 
prohibited during study participation.
Tuberculosis Testing/Tuberculosis Prophylaxis
The TB screening tests provide diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the subject's 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], history, exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine if a 
subject has previous, active, or latent TB.  Expert consultation for the evaluation and/or management of 
TB may be considered per investigator discretion.
At Screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk questionnaire 
(Operations Manual Section 3.2) and tested for TB infection by [CONTACT_82736]-TB Gold test.  The site staff 
will complete the TB risk questionnaire for all subjects regardless of TB test results and enter the data into the appropriate eCRF.  One or more "yes" response on the TB risk questionnaire indicates increased risk of TB.
If a subject had a negative [COMPANY_003] test within [ADDRESS_123644] (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) does not need to be repeated 
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123645]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  These cases may 
be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.  The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.
The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.Subjects with a negative TB test and CXR not suggestive of active TB or prior TB exposure may be 
enrolled.
Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent TB, including 
signs and symptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or symptoms and a CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see below).
Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled.For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or the most recent evaluation, an annual TB 
follow-up test will be performed.
If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a CXR needs to be performed as soon as possible 
to aid in distinguishing active versus latent TB and subsequent annual TB follow-up tests are not required.  Any positive TB test after the patient has started the study should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable).
If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_110957]'s medical history to warrant investigation and a repeat test before the next scheduled annual TB retest, the case (including the TB test results) should be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
TB test
!The QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or equivalent) should be performed at Screening on all subjects.  The [COMPANY_003] skin test should be utilized when the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or equivalent) is not possible or if both tests are required per local guidelines.
!Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test and/or [COMPANY_003] 
skin test are not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the study and should be 
considered positive.
!For regions that require both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing, both will be performed.  If either [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON-TB Gold is positive, the TB test is considered positive.
!The [COMPANY_003] Skin Test should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines).
!If only a [COMPANY_003] is placed at Screening, then the TB test to be used for the remainder of the study for that subject is the [COMPANY_003].  Similarly, if a subject enters the study with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test alone, then the subject should have their annual TB test performed with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test.
!If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test and 
the [COMPANY_003] are required per local guidelines) the [COMPANY_003] will be performed.  The [COMPANY_003] should be read 
by a licensed healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_123646] 
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123647].  The 
reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥5 mm is 
considered a positive reaction.  The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not "negative."
!Subjects who have an ulcerating reaction to [COMPANY_003] in the past should not be re-exposed and the [COMPANY_003] should be considered positive.
!If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a local QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to rule out a positive test result.  If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of this study.  If the testing result is negative, then the patient is considered to be negative.
!In cases where the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test by [CONTACT_110997][INVESTIGATOR_110958], the investigator may perform a local QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory if not locally available) to confirm the positive test result.  If the repeat testing result is negative, the investigator may consider the test to be negative based on his/her clinical judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive, the test is considered positive.
!An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) (such as T-SPOT TB test) may be substituted for the QuantiFERON-TB Gold.
TB prophylaxis
Note:  Rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_110959].
At Screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection, prophylactic treatment must be initiated 
at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer).  At 
least [ADDRESS_123648] be completed; however, the full course of prophylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study drug.
Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have documented completion of a full course of anti-TB 
therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant repeat treatment.  For subjects with completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy, but insufficient documentation, the investigator should consult with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
During the study, subjects with new evidence of latent TB must initiate prophylactic treatment 
immediately per local guidelines and complete at least [ADDRESS_123649] should be re-evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and symptoms as well as laboratory assessment of toxicity to TB prophylaxis.
Newly initiated prophylactic treatment and prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF.

12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A 12-lead ECG will be performed at Screening (Operations Manual Section 2.1).  The ECG should be performed prior to blood collection.
The ECGs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_41596] ("local reader").  The local 
reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following categories:
!Normal ECG
!Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant
!Abnormal ECG – clinically significant
Biomarker Sampling
Optional biospecimens (blood, serum, plasma, and skin biopsies) will be collected for biomarkerresearch at visits detailed in Appendix D .  All biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as 
outlined in the study-specific laboratory manual.  [COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store the samples and data in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples may be retained while research on upadacitinib (or drugs of this class) or atopic dermatitis and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion, or per local requirement.
Height and Body Weight
Height and body weight will be measured without shoes at visits specified in Appendix D .  All 
measurements will be recorded in imperial or metric units where applicable.

At any time, a symptom-directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples will be collected following a minimum 8-hour fast.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary (except during Screening visit), due to unforeseen circumstances, the non-fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.
A certified laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  
Laboratory reference ranges will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study.
Instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_110964].
A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by [CONTACT_17206].  
A microscopic analysis will be performed in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.
If a laboratory test value is outside the reference range and the investigator considers the laboratory 
result to be clinically significant, the investigator will:
!repeat the test to verify the out-of-range value;
!follow the out-of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resolution.
A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the study drug or requires a subject to receive treatment will be recorded as an AE.

All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the primary reason for 
discontinuation of study drug or study participation.  The information will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new 
treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.
Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's 
best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue participation in the 
study.

Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s).
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123662] this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during 
the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study drug, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.2regarding toxicity management) and/or if the investigator considers 
them to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a 
routine basis throughout the study.  All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
If any of the following events are reported, then the following supplemental report must be completed:
STUDY M16-046  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2018-002264-[ADDRESS_123663]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_123664] the adjudication process, additional information on any potential major 
adverse cardiovascular events will be collected, if applicable.

the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following AEs of special interest for upadacitinib will be monitored during the study:
!Serious infections
!Opportunistic infections
!Herpes zoster
!Active Tuberculosis
!Malignancy (all types)
!Adjudicated Gastrointestinal perforations
!Adjudicated cardiovascular events (e.g., major adverse cardiovascular event [MACE])
!Anemia
!Neutropenia
!Lymphopenia
!Increased serum creatinine and renal dysfunction
!Hepatic events and increased hepatic transaminases
!Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK)
!Adjudicated embolic and thrombotic events (non-cardiac, non-Central nervous system [CNS])
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AE according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.
If no grading criteria are provided for the reported event, then the event should be graded as follows:
Mild (Grade 1) Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated
Moderate (Grade 2) Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)

Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self care ADL (Self care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden)
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study drug:
Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the 
study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_110966], an Other 
cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_111001].
Pregnancy
While not an adverse event, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_123665] be discontinued from study drug treatment 
(Section 5.5).
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the event.

Laboratory 
Parameter Toxicity Management Guideline
Hemoglobin ! If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by [CONTACT_111003]
! If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline, without an alternative etiology, 
interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by [CONTACT_111003].
! If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline and an alternative etiology is known, 
the subject may remain on study drug at the investigator's discretion.
! If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)! If confirmed < 1000/μ L by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug dosing 
until ANC value returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
! Discontinue study drug if confirmed < 500/ μL by [CONTACT_111003].
Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC)! If confirmed < 500/ μL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug dosing 
until ALC returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
Total white blood cell count ! If confirmed < 2000/μ L by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug dosing 
until white blood cell count returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
Platelet count ! If confirmed < 50,000/ μL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until platelet count returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.

> 1.5.
! A separate blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure INR at the time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.  A repeat test of INR is not needed for determination if above toxicity management criteria are met.
! Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by [CONTACT_111005], nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5% increase from baseline).
! Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 5 × ULN by [CONTACT_111006] 2 weeks.
! Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 8 × ULN by [CONTACT_111007].
• Subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV DNA PCR 
testing at Screening who develop the following should have HBV DNA PCR testing performed within one week (based on initial elevated value):
! ALT> 5 × ULN OR
! ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternate cause is not readily identified.
! A separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be needed at the time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.  As with INR, a separate tube is needed.
A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing will require immediate interruption of study drug (unless not acceptable by [CONTACT_111008]) and a hepatologist consultation should occur within [ADDRESS_123670] when an alternative etiology has been determined.  The alternative etiology should be 
documented appropriately in the eCRF; study drug should be discontinued if no alternative 
etiology can be found and ALT or AST elevations persist.
For any confirmed ALT or AST elevations > [ADDRESS_123671], complete the appropriate supplemental 
hepatic eCRF(s).
Serum Creatinine ! If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the Baseline value and > ULN, repeat the test for serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the results.  If the results of 
the repeat testing still meet this criterion, then interrupt study drug and re-start study 
drug once serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × Baseline value and ≤ ULN.
For the above serum creatinine elevation scenario, complete the appropriate supplemental renal eCRF(s).

[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local guidelines and Appendix A of the Investigator Brochure will serve as the Reference Safety Information (RSI).  The RSI in effect at the start of a DSUR reporting period serves as the RSI during the reporting period.  For follow-up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the 'suspected' Serious Adverse Reaction will be used to assess expectedness.
7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The objective of the statistical analyses is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib for the treatment of adult subjects with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy.
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the Week 24 database lock.  The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population consists of all randomized subjects and will be used for the efficacy analyses.  A Per-Protocol Population may be defined if deemed necessary to exclude subjects with protocol violations that will affect the primary endpoint.  If defined, the criteria to determine the 
Per-Protocol Population will be detailed in the SAP.  List of subjects to be excluded from the 
Per-Protocol Population will be finalized before database lock and blind break.  The Per-Protocol Population, if defined, will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint.
The Safety Population consists of all randomized subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_123674] the superiority of upadacitinib over dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  In addition, the primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the Per Protocol Population, if defined.  Subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Categorical variables will be analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by [CONTACT_26469]-AD 
categories (vIGA-AD 3 or 4).  Continuous variables will be analyzed using mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM).
Missing values and visits after the rescue will be handled by [CONTACT_105]-responder imputation (NRI) for 
categorical variables (except for missing values due to COVID-19, which will be handled by [CONTACT_111012], NRI-C) or MMRM for continuous variables.
Primary Analysis
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving EASI [ADDRESS_123675], stratified by [CONTACT_26469]-AD categories.  NRI-C will be the primary approach to handle missing values, with multiple Imputation (MI) as the sensitivity approach to handle missing values.  Per-protocol analysis, if defined, will be used as another sensitivity analysis.
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the ranked order as outlined in Section 3.3.
Sample Size Estimation
Approximately 650 subjects (18 - 75 years old) will be randomized to upadacitinib 30 mg or dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24725] 
a ratio of 1:1 (325 subjects per treatment group).  Assuming an EASI [ADDRESS_123676] 50% in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110967], this sample size will provide more than 80% power to detect at least a 12% treatment difference using two-sided test at a 0.05 significant level.  The assumption of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110968] 75 at Week 16 and 12% treatment difference were based on the pooled response rates of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110933] 3 monotherapy studies (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2) and the response rate of upadacitinib 30 mg in the upadacitinib AD Phase 2b study.

7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Population and will be based on treatments the subjects actually received.  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], physical examination, laboratory assessments, and vital signs.  Note that missing safety data will not be imputed.  Analysis details will be specified in the SAP.
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA.  Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as those 
that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug and no more than [ADDRESS_123677] dose of study drug.  Specifically, 30 days will be used for upadacitinib, and 84 days (12 weeks) will be used for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using the MedDRA SOC and preferred term (PT), by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_111013].  Summaries (including percentages and events per 
100 patient-years) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation and AESIs will be provided as well.  Pre-treatment AEs will be summarized separately.
For laboratory and vital signs, mean change from Baseline and percentage of subject with evaluations 
meeting criteria for pre-defined Potentially Clinically Significant values will be summarized.
